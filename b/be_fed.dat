5|$|Elders, queens, and kits must <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> before {{apprentices}} and warriors. Unless {{they have}} permission, apprentices may not eat {{until they have}} hunted to feed the elders. If any warrior or apprentice is sick or injured, they may eat while the elders, queens, and kits are eating.|$|E
5|$|Grid-connected {{domestic}} {{wind turbines}} may use grid energy storage, thus replacing purchased electric power with locally produced power when available. The surplus power produced by domestic microgenerators can, in some jurisdictions, <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> into {{the network and}} sold to the utility company, producing a retail credit for the microgenerators' owners to offset their energy costs.|$|E
5|$|The AFVG {{was to be}} {{powered by}} a pair of SNECMA/Bristol Siddeley M45G turbofans, which were to <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> by Mirage-style half-shock cone inlets. The engine {{development}} programme contract was to be issued by the French government to a SNECMA/Bristol Siddeley joint venture company registered in France.|$|E
30|$|Thirty rabbits were {{randomized}} {{into five}} groups consisting of six animals each. Group 1 animals <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> with salt loaded diet continuously. Group 2 animals <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> with salt loaded diet followed by aqueous extract while animals in group 3 <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> with salt loaded diet followed by ethanol extract. Animals in group 4 <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> with salt loaded diet and distilled water while group 5 animals <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> with normal diet only.|$|R
30|$|For this purpose, 30 rats {{were divided}} as follows: control group, rats <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> {{balanced}} diet {{and served as}} normal control; group 2, rats <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> balanced diet and served as positive control; group 3, rats <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> balanced diet supplemented with taurine (100  mg/kg diet); group 4, rats <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> balanced diet supplemented with vanillin (100  mg/kg diet); and group 5, rats <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> balanced diet supplemented with taurine and vanillin at the same tested dose for 3  weeks. Groups from 2 to 5 were orally administered a single dose of KBrO 3 (100  mg/kg diet) then sacrificed after 48  h.|$|R

5|$|While the African wildcat is {{the ancestral}} {{subspecies}} from which domestic cats are descended, and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed (being subspecies {{of the same}} species), several intermediate stages occur between domestic pet and pedigree cats {{on one hand and}} entirely wild animals on the other. The semiferal cat, a mostly outdoor cat, is not owned by any one individual, but is generally friendly to people and may <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> by several households. Feral cats are associated with human habitation areas and may <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> by people or forage for food, but are typically wary of human interaction.|$|E
5|$|Bog turtles are {{omnivorous}} and eat {{aquatic plants}} (such as duckweed), seeds, berries, earthworms, snails, slugs, insects, other invertebrates, frogs, {{and other small}} vertebrates. They also occasionally eat carrion. Invertebrates such as insects are generally the most important food item. In captivity, a bog turtle can <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as meat such as liver, chicken hearts, and tinned dog food. Bog turtles feed only during the day, but rarely during the hottest hours, consuming their food on land or in the water.|$|E
5|$|By the 18thcentury, the menagerie {{was open}} to the public; {{admission}} cost three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog to <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> to the lions. By {{the end of the}} century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811.|$|E
50|$|Lake Jordan <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> {{primarily}} by the outflow of Tupper Lake, which in turn <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> by Tupper Creek all in Odessa and Sebewa townships in Ionia County.|$|R
50|$|The Tasmanian Devils <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> in the afternoon. 'Koala Forest' {{is a large}} koala {{enclosure}} {{with over}} 30 koalas surrounding the customers. Koalas there <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> mid-morning and mid-afternoon.|$|R
25|$|The lake <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> in Vermont by the LaPlatte, Lamoille, Missisquoi, Poultney, and Winooski rivers, {{along with}} Lewis Creek, Little Otter Creek, and Otter Creek. In New York, it <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> by the Ausable, Boquet, Great Chazy, La Chute, Little Ausable, Little Chazy, Salmon, and Saranac rivers, along with Putnam Creek. In Quebec, it <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> by the Pike River.|$|R
5|$|For {{the first}} few days after hatching, young red-throated loons are fed aquatic insects and small {{crustaceans}} by both parents. After 3–4days, the parents switch to fish small enough for the young birds to swallow whole. By four weeks of age, the young can eat the same food—of the same size—as their parents do. Young birds may <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> for some time after fledging; adults have been seen feeding fish to juveniles at sea and on inland lakes in the United Kingdom, hundreds of kilometres from any breeding areas.|$|E
5|$|Incubation {{takes two}} weeks. The hatched young, called squabs, are {{strongly}} altricial, being helpless at hatching {{and covered with}} down. Both parents feed the squabs pigeon's milk (dove's milk) for the first 3–4 days of life. Thereafter, the crop milk is gradually augmented by seeds. Fledging takes place in about 11–15 days, before the squabs are fully grown but after {{they are capable of}} digesting adult food. They stay nearby to <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> by their father for up to two weeks after fledging.|$|E
5|$|Oil-fired {{propulsion}} {{had many}} advantages for naval architects and officers at sea alike. It reduced smoke, making ships less visible. It could <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> into boilers automatically, rather than needing a complement of stokers {{to do it}} by hand. Oil has roughly twice the thermal content of coal. This meant that the boilers themselves could be smaller; and for the same volume of fuel, an oil-fired ship would have much greater range.|$|E
40|$|The 30 steers {{used were}} good to choice Herefords {{purchased}} as claves near Sterling, Kansas, and allotted to 3 lots of 10 steers each. Unlimited roughage <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> where grain <b>was</b> restricted. A ratio of 1 part roughage to 3 parts grain <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> on full feed. Protein supplement <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> at 2 lb. per head daily to all lots...|$|R

25|$|The Northumberland Strait <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> by the Kouchibouguac, Kouchibouguacis, Richibucto, Bouctouche, Cocagne and Shediac Rivers; {{while the}} Gulf of St. Lawrence <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> by the Tabusintac, Big Tracadie and Pokemouche Rivers.|$|R
5|$|The Cape sparrow mostly eats seeds, {{foraging}} {{in trees}} {{and on the}} ground. The larger seeds of cereals, wild grasses, and other small plants are preferred, with wheat and khakiweed (Alternanthera caracasana) being favourites. Buds and soft fruits are also taken, causing considerable damage to agriculture. Insects are eaten, and nestlings seem to <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> exclusively on caterpillars. The Cape sparrow eats the soft shoots of plants, and probes in aloes for nectar, {{but these are not}} important sources of food.|$|E
5|$|The M249 is gas {{operated}} and air-cooled. It has a quick-change barrel, allowing the gunner to rapidly replace an overheated or jammed barrel. A folding bipod is attached {{near the front}} of the gun, though an M192 LGM tripod is available. It can <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> from both linked ammunition and STANAG magazines, like those used in the M16 and M4. This allows the SAW gunner to use a rifleman's magazines as an emergency source of ammunition in the event that he runs out of linked rounds.|$|E
5|$|The Tornado GR1B was a {{specialised}} anti-shipping {{variant of}} the GR1. A total of 26 were converted, which were based at RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland, replacing the Blackburn Buccaneer. Each aircraft was equipped to carry up to four Sea Eagle anti-ship missiles. At first the GR1B lacked the radar capability to track shipping, instead relying on the missile's seeker for target acquisition, later updates allowed target data to <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> from aircraft to missile.|$|E

40|$|A {{corrugated}} {{conical horn}} antenna <b>is</b> simultaneously <b>fed</b> {{a multiplicity of}} signals, two for each of five frequencies, with each {{of a pair of}} signals fed in each of two orthogonal planes for excitation of a desired spherical hybrid mode. The lowest frequency <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> into the horn through orthogonal pairs of colinear slots, each pair being fed by coaxial tee power dividers. Other signals <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> through a circular waveguide connected to the vertex. The highest frequency signals <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> through orthogonal ports near {{the far end of the}} circular waveguide. The intermediate frequency signals <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> through orthogonal ports spaced along the waveguide. Filtering is incorporated for each to maintain isolation and low insertion loss...|$|R
5|$|The pantropical {{subfamily}} Nasutitermitinae has a specialised caste of soldiers, {{known as}} nasutes, {{that have the}} ability to exude noxious liquids through a horn-like frontal projection that they use for defence. Nasutes have lost their mandibles through the course of evolution and must <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> by workers. A wide variety of monoterpene hydrocarbon solvents have been identified in the liquids that nasutes secrete.|$|E
5|$|The {{vehicles}} {{have three}} braking systems: a primary regenerative dynamic brake, a secondary disc brake and an emergency rail brake. When braking with the regenerative brake, the energy can <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> {{back to the}} overhead wires. The trams are dimensioned to operate an entire day with the dynamic brakes disconnected from one bogie, and for one hour if disconnected from two bogies, in which case only disc brakes will be used.|$|E
5|$|To develop, {{the larvae}} must <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> both nectar for {{carbohydrates}} and pollen for protein. Bumblebees feed nectar to the larvae by chewing {{a small hole}} in the brood cell into which they regurgitate nectar. Larvae are fed pollen {{in one of two}} ways, depending on the bumblebee species. Pocket-making bumblebees create pockets of pollen {{at the base of the}} brood-cell clump from which the larvae feed themselves. Pollen-storing bumblebees keep pollen in separate wax pots and feed it to the larvae.|$|E
40|$|CONSOL {{completed}} {{characterization of}} 64 samples from five run conditions of HTI Run ALC- 1 (227 - 94), in which raw and cleaned (oil-agglomerated at low pH) Black Thunder Mine subbituminous coal <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> and processed using only dispersed catalysts in the liquefaction reactors. Extraction of THF-soluble resid from the pressure-filter cakes was more complete when agglomerates <b>were</b> <b>fed,</b> leaving only 5 % or less THF solubles in the extracted cakes. When raw coal <b>was</b> <b>fed,</b> the extracted cakes contained 9 - 34 % THF solubles. HTI also observed improved filtration during the periods that agglomerates <b>were</b> <b>fed.</b> Improved operability, if verified by additional work, {{could be an}} economically significant benefit of coal cleaning by oil agglomeration at low pH. An apparently higher Mo addition rate (see fourth bullet) {{may have contributed to}} the benefits of using oil-agglomerated coal. Other stream sample characteristics changed when oil-agglomerated coal <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> in Conditions 2 - 4, relative to when uncleaned coal <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> in Conditions 1 and 5. The ash content of the 0 - 6 bottoms samples was lower when oil-agglomerates <b>were</b> <b>fed.</b> The THF-soluble 524 {degrees}C+ resid concentration in the feed slurry doubled when agglomerated coal <b>was</b> <b>fed.</b> Three factors may have influenced these characteristics. Higher coal conversion would have produced more resid. More efficient toluene-extraction of the filter cake would have recycled more resid. Removal of distillate as product to offset oil fed as part of the agglomerated coal would preferentially recycle the heaviest components...|$|R
50|$|Lake Bakhtegan, Iran’s {{second largest}} lake, <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> mostly by the Kur River, while Lake Tashk <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> by {{overflow}} from the marshes at its west end {{and by a}} large permanent spring in the northwest.|$|R
50|$|Highway 1, the Trans-Canada Highway, and the {{mainline}} of the Canadian Pacific Railway {{parallel the}} river. Little Shuswap Lake <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> by the Little River, which drains Shuswap Lake, which <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> by several rivers and creeks.|$|R
5|$|At Winterfell, Ramsay Bolton mourns {{the death}} of Myranda, but {{commands}} that her corpse <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> to the hounds. Roose Bolton warns him that, despite their victory, they could be facing {{the wrath of the}} Lannisters in the future, and as such, they must secure the loyalty of the North's other nobles. Roose blames Ramsay for losing Sansa Stark, who, as a child of Eddard Stark, could have been used as a figure-head for the North. As such, Roose implies that he will disinherit Ramsay if he cannot retrieve her and his unborn child is a son.|$|E
5|$|By {{the close}} of 1961, the Food for Peace program was {{operating}} in a dozen countries, and 10 million more people had been fed with American surplus than the year before. In February 1962, McGovern visited India and oversaw a greatly expanded school lunch program thanks to Food for Peace; subsequently one in five Indian schoolchildren would <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> from it, and by mid-1962, 35 million children around the world. During an audience in Rome, Pope John XXIII warmly praised McGovern's work, and the distribution program was also popular among South Dakota's wheat farmers. In addition, McGovern {{was instrumental in the}} creation of the United Nations-run World Food Programme in December 1961; it started distributing food to stricken regions of the world the following year and would go on to become the largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Modern animal {{husbandry}} relies on production systems {{adapted to the}} type of land available. Subsistence farming is being superseded by intensive animal farming in the more developed parts of the world, where for example beef cattle are kept in high density feedlots, and thousands of chickens may be raised in broiler houses or batteries. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively, and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves. Most livestock are herbivores, except for the pig which is an omnivore. Ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, or may <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as pelleted cereals. Pigs and poultry cannot digest the cellulose in forage, and require cereals and other high-energy foods.|$|E
50|$|The reformator <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> with {{bioethanol}} as fuel, {{and oxygen}} (stored as a liquid {{in a high}} pressure cryogenic tank), generating hydrogen as a sub-product. The produced hydrogen and more oxygen <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> to the fuel cells.|$|R
