5|$|BaAl4 is an {{intermediate}} reacted with <b>barium</b> oxide {{to produce the}} metal. Note that not all <b>barium</b> is reduced.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barium</b> is a soft, silvery-white metal, with {{a slight}} golden shade when ultrapure. The silvery-white color of <b>barium</b> metal rapidly vanishes upon {{oxidation}} in air yielding a dark gray oxide layer. <b>Barium</b> has a medium specific weight and good electrical conductivity. Ultrapure <b>barium</b> {{is very difficult to}} prepare, and therefore many properties of <b>barium</b> have not been accurately measured yet.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barium</b> vapor is {{condensed}} {{and packed}} into molds {{in an atmosphere}} of argon. This method is used commercially, yielding ultrapure <b>barium.</b> Commonly sold <b>barium</b> is about 99% pure, with main impurities being strontium and calcium (up to 0.8% and 0.25%) and other contaminants contributing less than 0.1%.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of <b>barium</b> is 0.0425% in the Earth's crust and 13µg/L in sea water. The primary commercial source of <b>barium</b> is barite (also called barytes or heavy spar), a <b>barium</b> sulfate mineral. with deposits {{in many parts}} of the world. Another commercial source, far less important than barite, is witherite, a <b>barium</b> carbonate mineral. The main deposits are located in England, Romania, and the former USSR.|$|E
5|$|The <b>barium</b> mineral, benitoite (<b>barium</b> {{titanium}} silicate), {{occurs as}} a very rare blue fluorescent gemstone, and is the official state gem of California.|$|E
5|$|After {{delivery}} of the barium-lanthanum material to Los Alamos, it was stored in a dedicated building in the Bayo Canyon Site. At first, the mixture was used as-is, both <b>barium</b> and lanthanum together, but this led to unpleasant radioactive contamination that {{took a long time}} to disappear as the half-life of barium-140 is 12.5 days. Shortly after, the process was improved; <b>barium</b> was removed chemically, by double precipitation from a solution as <b>barium</b> sulfate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barium</b> {{hydroxide}} ("baryta") {{was known}} to alchemists, who produced it by heating <b>barium</b> carbonate. Unlike calcium hydroxide, it absorbs very little CO2 in aqueous solutions and is therefore insensitive to atmospheric fluctuations. This property is used in calibrating pH equipment.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBa and atomic number56. It {{is the fifth}} element in group 2 and is a soft, silvery alkaline earth metal. Because of its high chemical reactivity, <b>barium</b> is never found in nature as a free element. Its hydroxide, known in pre-modern history as baryta, does not occur as a mineral, but can be prepared by heating <b>barium</b> carbonate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barium</b> is not {{carcinogenic}} and it {{does not}} bioaccumulate. Inhaled dust containing insoluble <b>barium</b> compounds can accumulate in the lungs, causing a benign condition called baritosis. The insoluble sulfate is nontoxic and is not classified as a dangerous goods in transport regulations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barium</b> {{reacts with}} ammonia to form {{complexes}} such as Ba(NH3)6.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barium</b> salts are {{typically}} white when solid and colorless when dissolved, and <b>barium</b> ions provide no specific coloring. They are denser than the strontium or calcium analogs, {{except for the}} halides (see table; zinc is given for comparison).|$|E
5|$|<b>Barium</b> {{titanate}} is {{a promising}} electroceramic.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble <b>barium</b> compounds are poisonous. In low doses, <b>barium</b> ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble <b>barium</b> compounds (i.e., <b>barium</b> ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E
5|$|Other {{compounds}} of <b>barium</b> {{find only}} niche applications, {{limited by the}} toxicity of Ba2+ ions (<b>barium</b> carbonate is a rat poison), {{which is not a}} problem for the insoluble BaSO4.|$|E
5|$|Strontium is a {{divalent}} silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose properties are mostly intermediate between and {{similar to those}} of its group neighbors calcium and <b>barium.</b> It is softer than calcium and harder than <b>barium.</b> Its melting (777°C) and boiling (1655°C) points are lower than those of calcium (842°C and 1757°C respectively); <b>barium</b> continues this downward trend in the melting point (727°C), but not in the boiling point (2170°C). The density of strontium (2.64g/cm3) is similarly intermediate between those of calcium (1.54g/cm3) and <b>barium</b> (3.594g/cm3). Three allotropes of metallic strontium exist, with transition points at 235 and 540°C.|$|E
5|$|The metal {{is readily}} {{attacked}} by most acids. Sulfuric acid is a notable exception because passivation stops the reaction by forming the insoluble <b>barium</b> sulfate on the surface. <b>Barium</b> combines with several metals, including aluminium, zinc, lead, and tin, forming intermetallic phases and alloys.|$|E
5|$|To avoid a {{potentially}} vigorous chemical reaction, <b>barium</b> metal {{is kept in}} an argon atmosphere or under mineral oils. Contact with air is dangerous and may cause ignition. Moisture, friction, heat, sparks, flames, shocks, static electricity, and exposure to oxidizers and acids should be avoided. Anything that may contact with <b>barium</b> should be electrically grounded. Anyone who works with the metal should wear pre-cleaned non-sparking shoes, flame-resistant rubber clothes, rubber gloves, apron, goggles, and a gas mask. Smoking in the working area is forbidden. Thorough washing is required after handling <b>barium.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Barium</b> {{fluoride}} is {{used for}} optics in infrared applications because of its wide transparency range of 0.15–12micrometers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barium</b> {{oxide coating}} on the {{electrodes}} of fluorescent lamps facilitates {{the release of}} electrons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barium</b> {{peroxide}} is {{a catalyst}} in the aluminothermic reaction (thermite) for welding rail tracks. It {{is also a}} green flare in tracer ammunition and a bleaching agent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barium</b> sulfate {{was first}} applied as a radiocontrast agent in X-ray imaging of the {{digestive}} system in 1908.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barium,</b> as a {{metal or}} when alloyed with aluminium, {{is used to}} remove {{unwanted}} gases (gettering) from vacuum tubes, such as TV picture tubes. <b>Barium</b> is suitable for this purpose because of its low vapor pressure and reactivity towards oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water; it can even partly remove noble gases by dissolving them in the crystal lattice. This application is gradually disappearing due to the rising popularity of the tubeless LCD and plasma sets.|$|E
5|$|By {{its great}} atomic density, <b>barium</b> {{carbonate}} increases the refractive index and luster {{of glass and}} reduces leaks of X-rays from cathode ray tubes (CRT) TV sets.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the large}} size of the heavy s-block elements, {{including}} strontium, a vast range of coordination numbers is known, from 2, 3, or 4 {{all the way to}} 22 or 24 in SrCd11 and SrZn13. The Ca2+ ion is quite large, so that high coordination numbers are the rule. The large size of strontium and <b>barium</b> plays a significant part in stabilising strontium complexes with polydentate macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers: for example, while 18-crown-6 forms relatively weak complexes with calcium and the alkali metals, its strontium and <b>barium</b> complexes are much stronger.|$|E
5|$|Ferrite, {{a type of}} {{sintered}} ceramic {{composed of}} Iron Oxide (Fe2O3) and <b>barium</b> oxide (BaO), is both electrically nonconductive and ferrimagnetic, and can be temporarily or permanently magnetized.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{a number}} of ternary oxides of the type M(II)CmO3 are known, where M stands for a {{divalent}} metal, such as <b>barium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mixtures of {{selenium}} and tellurium {{are used}} with <b>barium</b> peroxide as an oxidizer in the delay powder of electric blasting caps.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium {{metal can}} be {{prepared}} by reduction of its fluoride with calcium fluoride, lithium or <b>barium</b> at a temperature of 1300–1400°C.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barium</b> {{occurs in}} {{the water of the}} Black Creek watershed, {{typically}} at concentrations of less than 0.07 milligrams per liter. Beryllium is about as common, with a concentration of less than 0.06 milligrams per liter. Strontium is much more common, with a concentration of up to 4.4 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the simple}} oxide CaO, the {{peroxide}} CaO2 {{can be made}} by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Ca(O2)2. Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium, <b>barium</b> or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of calcium are known. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals. Like strontium and <b>barium,</b> as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
5|$|Compounds with krypton {{bonded to}} atoms other than {{fluorine}} {{have also been}} discovered. There are also unverified reports of a <b>barium</b> salt of a krypton oxoacid. ArKr+ and KrH+ polyatomic ions have been investigated and there is evidence for KrXe or KrXe+.|$|E
5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and <b>barium</b> to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% <b>barium</b> oxide.|$|E
5|$|Metallic {{americium}} {{is obtained}} by reduction from its compounds. Americium(III) fluoride {{was first used}} for this purpose. The reaction was conducted using elemental <b>barium</b> as reducing agent in a water- and oxygen-free environment inside an apparatus made of tantalum and tungsten.|$|E
5|$|Metallic curium is {{obtained}} {{by reduction of}} its compounds. Initially, curium(III) fluoride was used for this purpose. The reaction was conducted in the environment free from water and oxygen, in the apparatus made of tantalum and tungsten, using elemental <b>barium</b> or lithium as reducing agents.|$|E
5|$|Nobelium's {{complexing}} ability with chloride ions is most {{similar to}} that of <b>barium,</b> which complexes rather weakly. Its complexing ability with citrate, oxalate, and acetate in an aqueous solution of 0.5Mammonium nitrate is between that of calcium and strontium, although it is somewhat closer to that of strontium.|$|E
