5|$|Game Revolution {{had a more}} {{critical}} review of Dino Crisis than others, saying the game expanded on the worse elements of Resident Evil while also ruining the good elements. They were impressed by the graphics but thought the environments looked too similar and got boring after a short time. Overall, they believed the game to <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> Resident Evil 2, pointing out the game's shorter length, more tedious puzzles, weaker action, and lesser scare factor.|$|E

5|$|Upon release, Sonic Generations {{received}} positive reviews. Critics {{found its}} visuals, audio, and gameplay to be highlights, though it received criticism for occasional framerate and control problems. Reception to the 3DS version was more polarized, with reviewers criticizing its short length and determined it to <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> Dimps' previous Sonic games. The game was a commercial success, eventually selling 1.85 million copies across all platforms. The Classic iteration of Sonic {{introduced in the}} game has since become a recurring character in the Sonic series.|$|E
5|$|The {{garden was}} {{demolished}} in the 1960s, {{as was the}} golf house (in 1967). In the garden's location and replacing {{the use of the}} golf house, a wing was added to the clubhouse, constructed on the northeast terrace and completed in 1962. The building holds a pro shop, dining facilities, and locker rooms. The structure was designed to be spacious and convenient and not be noticeable from the grounds below, although from Woodlea, the sight of the tar roof and ventilators was noted to <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> the prior standing gardens. The club hosted the NYNEX Commemorative from 1986 to 1993. In 1989, professional golfer Bob Charles set a current record when he won the tournament. In 2002, the club hosted the U.S. Women's Amateur Golf Championship.|$|E
5|$|British {{intelligence}} assessed that Tirpitz {{could be}} repaired within six months, and the Admiralty ordered further carrier-borne strikes against the battleship. First Sea Lord Andrew Cunningham {{did not believe}} that Barracudas could carry weapons capable of sinking Tirpitz, but he hoped that further attacks would increase the period the battleship was out of service and harm her crew's morale. The commander of the Home Fleet, Vice Admiral Bruce Fraser, initially resisted this order on the grounds that further carrier raids on Kaafjord were unlikely to be successful as Tirpitzs defences would have been reinforced and weather conditions were likely to <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> those encountered during Operation Tungsten. Following an argument with Cunningham, Fraser eventually agreed to attack Kaafjord again. Despite the decision to make further attacks on Kaafjord, many of the Home Fleet's airmen were posted to other units following Operation Tungsten. This hindered subsequent operations against German forces in Norway as the new aircrew were less experienced than the men they replaced.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge was}} closed to motor {{vehicles}} on 15 February 2010 for refurbishment and strengthening. It was originally expected to remain closed for approximately 18 months, but after {{the condition of the}} bridge was found to <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> expected, it was closed for 22 months. All of the timber in the decking as well as the footway that had rotted away were replaced, with additional timber added for strengthening. Surfaces at the carriageway and pavement decking were replaced. New steel structures were added to strengthen the bridge. All the lightbulbs were changed to more energy-efficient ones. The tollbooths were refurbished. All twelve layers of paint were stripped down until the bare metal was exposed, which was repaired and treated before three new coats of paint were added. The whole project cost £7.2 million of which the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea provided 25% of the cost and the other 75% was provided by Transport for London.|$|E
5|$|Following Operation Tungsten, British {{intelligence}} assessed that Tirpitz {{would be}} repaired within six months. Accordingly, Cunningham directed Fraser on 13 April to launch another {{attack on the}} battleship. While Cunningham {{did not believe that}} Barracudas could carry weapons capable of sinking Tirpitz, he hoped that further air strikes would increase the period the battleship was out of service and harm her crew's morale. Fraser initially resisted Cunningham's order, arguing that the prospects for a successful raid were poor as the Germans would have reinforced the defences around Tirpitz and weather conditions were likely to <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> those encountered during Operation Tungsten. He eventually relented, and Moore sailed from Scapa Flow on 21 April to attack Kaafjord again. This raid, designated Operation Planet, was called off on 24 April due to bad weather over the target area. Two other attacks, Operation Brawn and Operation Tiger Claw, also had to be cancelled on 15 and 28 May respectively because of adverse weather. Further carrier raids were attempted in July and August after Allied intelligence determined that the repairs to Tirpitz were nearing completion. During Operation Mascot a force of 42 Barracudas and 40 fighters attacked Tirpitz on 17 July, but did not score any hits as the battleship was hidden by a smokescreen. A further four carrier raids were conducted against Kaafjord between 22 and 29 August during Operation Goodwood, but these caused only light damage to the battleship.|$|E
5|$|The Oman Chairman of the National Committee for Civil Defence, General Malek Bin Sulaiman Al Ma'amari, remarked {{the nation}} had already {{developed}} a contingency plan, {{which included the}} activation of army and police personnel after the storm's passage. Significant damage was expected, especially in northeastern areas, along with up to 150mm (6in) of rainfall and very strong winds. Officials recommended citizens evacuate from potentially affected areas, and about 7,000people were forced to leave Masirah Island due {{to the threat of}} high surf and strong winds. Overall, more than 20,000people evacuated to emergency shelters. A state of emergency was declared for the nation. The Omani national weather service warned that the cyclone was expected to <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> the destructive cyclone that hit Masirah Island in 1977. The Mina al Fahal oil terminal closed for over three days due to the threat of the storm. Omani officials closed government offices for two days and declared a five-day-long national holiday. Most businesses near the coastline were closed prior to the announcement. Authorities at the Muscat International Airport (then named as Seeb International Airport) canceled of all flights after 2000UTC on June 5 due to the cyclone.|$|E

25|$|The {{relations}} between Kosovo-Albanians and Serbs have been hostile since {{the rise of}} nationalism in the Balkans during the 19th century. During Communism in Yugoslavia, the ethnic Albanians and Serbs were strongly irreconcilable with sociological studies during the Tito-era indicating that ethnic Albanians and Serbs rarely accepted each other as neighbours or friends and few held interethnic marriages. Ethnic prejudices, stereotypes and mutual distrust between ethnic Albanians and Serbs have remained common for decades. The level of intolerance and separation between both communities during the Tito-period was reported by sociologists to <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> that of Croat and Serb communities in Yugoslavia which also had tensions but held some closer {{relations between}} each other.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, at {{the time}} of the Pakistan Resolution, Maududi taught that Pakistan was destined to be an Islamic missionary nation.

He likened the Congress to Robert Clive, and Arthur Wellesley, and Muslim followers of the Congress to collaborators like Mir Jafar and Mir Sadiq. He compared nationalism and communism to the Shuddhi movement. Maududi criticised Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, alleging that he opposed religion, was an enemy of any division on basis of faith and planned to merge Islam into the Hindu faith.|$|E
