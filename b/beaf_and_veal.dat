The culinary value of beef <b>and</b> <b>veal</b> meat is {{determined}} by tenderness and palatability. 23 % of meat produced in Europe (about 7, 5 mln ton) is beef, veal production is estimated about 800 000 ton per year.

40|$|The beef <b>and</b> <b>veal</b> market {{organization}} regime {{is going to}} be strongly reformed by the Mid Term Review (MTR) agreed by the Presidency compromise on 26 June 2003. Actually, the beef <b>and</b> <b>veal</b> supporting aid-system based on various types of direct farmers’ premia will be turned to a single farm payment. Options for partial decoupling can also be applied even regionally depending on member states decision. For Italian beef <b>and</b> <b>veal</b> sector decoupling is a critical issue. The different Italian livestock production systems and the lower financial support because of a partial application of Agenda 2000 make decisions about decoupling a hardly task. Effects of different decoupling options have been analyzed joint to national ceiling reduction. A positive mathematical programming model has been calibrated on the beef <b>and</b> <b>veal</b> sector of Veneto Region. Results show that a decrease in livestock numbers and farmers’ income is mitigated when partial decoupling is applied. A reduction in young cattle price may further compensate the negative impact of decoupling...|$|R

40|$|International audienceInsulator {{elements}} {{play a role}} in {{gene regulation}} that is potentially linked to nuclear organization. Boundary element-associated factors (<b>BEAFs)</b> 32 A <b>and</b> 32 B associate with hundreds of sites on Drosophila polytene chromosomes. We hybridized DNA isolated by chromatin immunoprecipitation to genome tiling microarrays to construct a genome-wide map of BEAF binding locations. A distinct difference in the association of 32 A and 32 B with chromatin was noted. We identified 1, 820 <b>BEAF</b> peaks <b>and</b> found that more than 85 % were less than 300 bp from transcription start sites. Half are between head-to-head gene pairs. BEAF-associated genes are transcriptionally active as judged by the presence of RNA polymerase II, dimethylated histone H 3 K 4, and the alternative histone H 3. 3. Forty percent of these genes are also associated with the polymerase negative elongation factor NELF. Like NELF-associated genes, most BEAF-associated genes are highly expressed. Using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, we found that the expression levels of most BEAF-associated genes decrease in embryos and cultured cells lacking BEAF. These results provide an unexpected link between <b>BEAF</b> <b>and</b> transcription, suggesting that BEAF plays a role in maintaining most associated promoter regions in an environment that facilitates high transcription levels...|$|R

Detection and {{quantification}} {{of tissue}} of origin in salmon <b>and</b> <b>veal</b> products using methylation sensitive AFLPs. Food Chemistry, 131 (4), 1493 - 1498. otherstatus: Online First RONO: 00 Food quality {{depends largely on}} the source of origin of the products used. Here we use methylation sensitive amplified polymorphisms (MSAP) analysis to diagnose and quantify the tissue of origin in salmon <b>and</b> <b>veal</b> products. We exploited the variability of MSAP profiles between tissues of an organism in order to characterise {{the origin of the}} food product. MSAP profiles provided robust discrimination of tissues from salmon (brain, eye, liver <b>and</b> muscle) <b>and</b> <b>veal</b> (heart, kidney, liver and muscle). Isolation of the diagnostic markers revealed by MSAP may ultimately allow {{for the development of a}} new STS-based epigenetic profiling technique for the detection and quantification of mixture of tissues in the same sample: offering not only rapid determination of the tissue of origin but also potential quantification of the components in processed food products.

40|$|Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) {{is highly}} {{prevalent}} in pigs <b>and</b> <b>veal</b> calves. The environment and air in pig <b>and</b> <b>veal</b> calf barns is often contaminated with LA-MRSA, and {{can act as}} a transmission source for humans. This study explores exposure-response relationships between sequence type 398 (ST 398) MRSA air exposure level and nasal ST 398 MRSA carriage in people working and/or living on farms. Samples and data were used from three longitudinal field studies in pig <b>and</b> <b>veal</b> calf farm populations. Samples consisted of nasal swabs from the human participants and electrostatic dust fall collectors capturing airborne settled dust in barns. In both multivariate and mutually adjusted analyses, a strong association was found between nasal ST 398 MRSA carriage in people working in the barns for > 20 h per week and MRSA air levels. In people working in the barns < 20 h per week there was a strong association between nasal carriage and number of working hours. Exposure to ST 398 MRSA in barn air seems to be an important determinant for nasal carriage, especially in the highly exposed group of farmers, next to duration of contact with animals. Intervention measures should therefore probably also target reduction of ST 398 MRSA air levels. </p...|$|R
