5|$|The group {{agrees that}} Randall is an {{imminent}} threat, and Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) believes {{he should be}} executed but waits until sunset. Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) finds most of the group agree with Rick's decision, and attempts {{to change their minds}} <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> their humanity, civilization and morality. Most agree with Rick's choice for various reasons, but Shane (Jon Bernthal) agrees to support Dale should he be able to convince the others to change their minds.|$|E
5|$|Later Reformed theologians reacted against Barth's {{views on}} baptism <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> Calvin, {{the idea that}} baptism is a promise rather than an {{accomplished}} reality, {{and the idea of}} baptism as a replacement of circumcision. Scottish Reformed theologian T.F. Torrance emphasized the idea that baptism is God's word establishing the church, and that the individual's response comes after rather than before God's act in baptism. German Reformed liberation theologian Jürgen Moltmann, on the other hand, saw infant baptism as inappropriately associated with the national church. He saw baptism as properly a free response God's call to discipleship. Reformed churches have generally maintained the practice of infant baptism despite these critiques.|$|E
5|$|The Capture of Savannah, or {{sometimes}} the First Battle of Savannah (because of a siege in 1779), was an American Revolutionary War battle fought on December 29, 1778 pitting local American Patriot militia and Continental Army units, holding the city, against a British invasion force {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Colonel Archibald Campbell. The British seizure of the city led to an extended occupation and was the opening move in the British southern strategy to regain control of the rebellious Southern provinces <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> the relatively strong Loyalist sentiment there.|$|E

50|$|On Sunday, 15February 1002, he was consecrated {{bishop of}} Beth Nuhadra (present-day Dohuk, Iraq) by Yohannan, {{who had become}} the Nestorian patriarch in 1000 <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> {{directly}} <b>to</b> the Abbasid governor at Shiraz {{without regard to the}} usual election procedures.|$|R

5|$|The Kenyan government's {{attempt to}} defer the cases at the ICC <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> {{members of the}} UN Security Council failed without being voted on, however the government, {{represented}} by British lawyers Geoffrey Nice and Rodney Dixon, have subsequently applied directly to the Court. The Kenyan government's application to Pre-Trial Chamber II that the two cases were inadmissible was rejected unanimously by the judges. Many victims of the post-election violence voiced opposition to the government's stance, and a poll of Kenyans conducted by Synovate shortly after Moreno Ocampo's announcement {{that he intended to}} seek summonses showed that sixty percent of Kenyans supported the trial of the accused taking place in The Hague.|$|E
5|$|Hitsugaya {{lived with}} his {{grandmother}} and with Momo Hinamori, whom he considers a very close friend. Hitsugaya excelled in the Soul Reaper academy, becoming the youngest captain {{in the history of}} Soul Society with command over Squad 10. Introduced to the Gotei 13, Hitsugaya suspected Squad 3 captain Gin Ichimaru of foul play as the circumstances surrounding the coming execution of Rukia Kuchiki become more complicated. When Hinamori is manipulated into thinking that Hitsugaya killed Sōsuke Aizen, Hitsugaya attacks Gin on the notion that he tricked her. The fight is interrupted when Hitsugaya dodges an attack that almost kills Hinamori, only to be intercepted by his lieutenant Rangiku Matsumoto. Seeing how destructive Rukia's execution is becoming, Hitsugaya tries to stop it <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> the Chamber 46, only to discover all members were murdered by Aizen, who faked his death. When Hitsugaya discovers Hinamori injured, Hitsugaya tries to kill Aizen but is defeated.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite their}} vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi {{believe that they}} do, to a certain extent, have {{control over their own}} health and well-being. They tell their husbands that the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous and encourage them to refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact. In addition, many women are convinced that, <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> the vulnerability of their children (who will probably be orphaned if their parents contract HIV), they can convince their husbands to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters. Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk. Finally, as a last resort, women might warn their husbands that they will visit the ankhoswe, or traditional marriage counselor, and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.|$|E
5000|$|Reviewers from Hindustan Times {{found the}} 'distinctive voice' <b>by</b> Bhardwaj <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> listeners, and stated {{composer}} of the song, Pritam deserves all the 'kudos' for composing this song. Koimoi's Shivi reviewed the song [...] "Bhardwaj has sung this one really beautifully while lyrics are very meaningful and poetic too".|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} section of the book, Goodman {{demonstrates}} the absurdity of the common assumption that something must resemble another thing to represent it. He does <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> both <b>to</b> common sense and to mathematical relation theory. Instead, he suggests that representation be seen as a particular type of arbitrary denotation.|$|R
50|$|Perlow {{frequently}} {{speaks out}} on issues affecting the American Orthodox Jewish world, including Internet usage, child abuse, Holocaust denial, overpriced Jewish weddings, and even U.S. politics. In 2015 Perlow shocked attendees at the 93rd annual Agudath Israel of America dinner <b>by</b> directly <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> President Obama {{to reconsider the}} Iran deal.|$|R
5|$|In 1983's Return of the Jedi, the Emperor {{appears in}} person {{to oversee the}} last stages of the second Death Star's construction. He assures Darth Vader that they will {{together}} turn Luke, now revealed to be Vader's son, to the dark side. Unknown to Vader, the Emperor plans to replace his apprentice with Luke. When Vader brings Luke before his master, the Emperor tempts Luke to join the dark side <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> the young Jedi's fear for his friends, whom he has lured into a trap. This leads to a lightsaber duel in which Luke defeats and nearly kills Vader. The Emperor tells Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses and declares himself a Jedi. Enraged, the Emperor attacks Luke with Force lightning. Moved by his son's cries for help, Vader throws the Emperor into the Death Star's reactor shaft, killing him.|$|E
5|$|Nixon's advisors denied he had {{abandoned}} {{a desire to}} bring the American people together. However, they were divided between those who sought national unity, and those, such as campaign manager and Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who felt Nixon should concentrate on keeping the voters who had cast their ballots for him, and should seek {{to win over the}} voters who had favored third-party candidate Alabama Governor George Wallace, as the key to reelection in 1972. According to Safire, after taking office, Nixon and his advisors decided he need not bring the country together, but need only work to secure his reelection <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> voters who were not hostile to Nixon and his policies—they became known as the Silent Majority. Historian Stanley Kutler suggested in his book on the Nixon administration that Nixon's policies widened divisions in America, but that the nation finally came together late in his presidency—to reject Nixon and demand his removal.|$|E
5|$|Stephen King criticised the {{reactions}} of some reviewers to the books, including McCauley, for jumping too quickly to surface conclusions of the work. He felt this was inevitable, because of the extreme secrecy before launch which did not allow reviewers time to read and consider the book, but meant that many early reviews lacked depth. Rather than finding the writing style disappointing, he felt it had matured and improved. He acknowledged that {{the subject matter of}} the books had become more adult, and that Rowling had clearly been writing with the adult audience firmly in mind since the middle of the series. He compared the works in this respect to Huckleberry Finn and Alice in Wonderland which achieved success and have become established classics, in part <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> the adult audience as well as children.|$|E
50|$|The Laupheim Jews contributed {{substantially}} to {{the effort}} to have Laupheim elevated {{to the status of}} city, <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> repeatedly <b>to</b> the King of Württemberg to grant Laupheim this status from {{the early years of the}} 1860s onwards. Finally, in a charter of 1869, the King of Württemberg conferred on Laupheim city rights.|$|R
50|$|By 1900, {{there was}} an attempt to popularize Dos Abend Blatt amongst the Jewish community, through {{introduction}} of 'Jewish News' and 'Jewish Letters' (from abroad) sections. However, this shift in editorial policy gave little benefit, as Forverts had already won over major sections of readership <b>by</b> consistently <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> the notion of Yiddishkeit.|$|R

Indeed, <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> {{appropriately}} <b>to</b> the definitions in (3.4) to (3.7) {{in conjunction with the}} Eulerian Gamma-function integral in (3.13), it is fairly straightforward to derive the integral representation formulas asserted by Theorem 5 below.|$|R
5|$|The Continental {{leaders of}} the church {{immediately}} after 1066 justified the Conquest by denigrating the pre-Conquest state of the Anglo-Saxon church. Newcomers such as Lanfranc, who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1070, {{had no interest in}} saints venerated by the Anglo-Saxons, and his Constitutiones for Christ Church, Canterbury, show no debt to the Regularis Concordia. However, Anglo-Norman monks soon turned the Anglo-Saxon hagiographical tradition to their own uses, and saints venerated by the Anglo-Saxons regained respect. Monasteries' land and privileges were defended <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> pre-Conquest charters, and fabricating fraudulent ones if necessary. In the next generation two historians of mixed parentage, Eadmer and William of Malmesbury, saw a pattern of an early Northumbrian peak followed by decline until a revival in the tenth century, and a further decline which reached its nadir {{on the eve of the}} Conquest. This scheme, which saw both the tenth century and the post-Conquest as peaks of monastic excellence preceded by periods of decline, satisfied both Norman propaganda and Anglo-Saxon pride, but in Gransden's view it unfairly denigrates the achievements of the periods of so-called decline.|$|E
5|$|Bon Jovi's third album, Slippery When Wet (1986), mixed {{hard rock}} with a pop {{sensitivity}} {{and spent a}} total of 8 weeks {{at the top of}} the Billboard 200 album chart, selling 12 million copies in the US while becoming the first hard rock album to spawn three top 10 singles — two of which reached number one. The album has been credited with widening the audiences for the genre, particularly <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> women as well as the traditional male dominated audience, and opening the door to MTV and commercial success for other bands at the end of the decade. The anthemic The Final Countdown (1986) by Swedish group Europe was an international hit, reaching number eight on the US charts while hitting the top 10 in nine other countries. This era also saw more glam-infused American hard rock bands come to the forefront, with both Poison and Cinderella releasing their multi-platinum début albums in 1986. Van Halen released 5150 (1986), their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals, which was number one in the US for three weeks and sold over 6 million copies. By the second half of the decade, hard rock had become the most reliable form of commercial popular music in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E
25|$|The PRSSA {{has been}} {{actively}} promoting The Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2009, HR 2499 <b>by</b> directly <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> {{the members of}} Congress through meetings and talks. Raul Vidal y Sepulveda, President of the PRSSA, has led and organized this effort, successfully gathering support from different members of Congress {{and other members of}} different political sectors.|$|R
5000|$|The Populists {{hoped to}} bypass black Republican politicians, who they viewed as corrupt, <b>by</b> {{directly}} <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> black farmers via the Colored Alliance. However, the Colored Alliance was in rapid decline and black Republican politicians and newspapers were largely {{critical of the}} Southern Populists, whose claims of support for black civil rights were largely rhetorical and disingenuous.|$|R
2500|$|Commander-in-Chief George Washington stopped {{any serious}} talk <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> {{successfully}} <b>to</b> his officers {{to support the}} supremacy of Congress in an emotional address on March 15. [...] Not long afterward, Congress approved a compromise agreement it had previously rejected: some of the pay arrears were funded, and soldiers were granted five years of full pay instead of a lifetime pension of half pay.|$|R
5|$|In July 1960, Takawira and {{two other}} NDP {{officials}} were arrested; in protest, Mugabe joined a demonstration of 7,000 people who planned to march from Highfield to the Prime Minister's office in Salisbury. The demonstration was stopped by riot police outside Stoddart Hall in Harare township. By midday the next day, the crowd had grown to 40,000 and a makeshift platform had been erected for speakers. Having become a much-respected figure through his profession, his possession of three degrees, and his travels abroad, Mugabe was among those invited {{to speak to the}} crowd. Following this event, Mugabe decided to devote himself full-time to activism, resigning his teaching post in Ghana (after having served two years of the four year teaching contract). He chaired the first NDP congress, held in October 1960, assisted by Chitepo on the procedural aspects. Mugabe was elected the party's publicity secretary. Mugabe consciously injected emotionalism into the NDP's African nationalism, hoping to broaden its support among the wider population <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> traditional cultural values. He helped to form the NDP Youth Wing and encouraged the incorporation of ancestral prayers, traditional costume, and female ululation into its meetings. In February 1961 he married Hayfron in a Roman Catholic ceremony conducted in Salisbury; she had converted to Catholicism to make this possible.|$|E
5|$|In the 1918 midterm congressional elections, held {{just before}} the armistice, Republicans {{narrowly}} {{took control of the}} Senate. Harding was appointed to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Wilson took no senators with him to the Paris Peace Conference, confident that he could force what became the Treaty of Versailles through the Senate <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> the people. When he returned with a single treaty establishing both peace and a League of Nations, the country was overwhelmingly on his side. Many senators disliked Article X of the League Covenant, that committed signatories to the defense of any member nation that was attacked, seeing it as forcing the United States to war without the assent of Congress. Harding was one of 39 senators who signed a round-robin letter opposing the League. When Wilson invited the Foreign Relations Committee to the White House to informally discuss the treaty, Harding ably questioned Wilson about Article X; the president evaded his inquiries. The Senate debated Versailles in September 1919, and Harding made a major speech against it. By then, Wilson had suffered a stroke while on a speaking tour. With an incapacitated President in the White House and less support in the country, the treaty was defeated.|$|E
5|$|Though {{there were}} {{attempts}} {{to bridge the}} differences between North and South, ultimately Lincoln's victory prompted seven southern slave states to secede from the United States and form the Confederate States of America before he moved into the White House. The Confederate attack on Fort Sumter inspired the North to rally behind the Union. As {{the leader of the}} moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans, who demanded harsher treatment of the South, War Democrats, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp, anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads), who despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other, by carefully planned political patronage, and <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> the American people with his powers of oratory. His Gettysburg Address became an iconic endorsement of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. He suspended habeas corpus, leading to the controversial ex parte Merryman decision, and he averted potential British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of generals, including his most successful general, Ulysses S. Grant. He made major decisions on Union war strategy, including a naval blockade that shut down the South's trade. As the war progressed, his complex moves toward ending slavery included the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; Lincoln used the U.S. Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraged the border states to outlaw slavery, and pushed through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which permanently outlawed slavery.|$|E
5000|$|Though Jennings {{fought the}} results further <b>by</b> <b>appealing</b> {{directly}} <b>to</b> the United States House of Representatives, this action, too, {{caused her to}} walk away empty-handed. After a three-person House task force was created to evaluate the election, the task force voted along party lines to refer an investigation into Florida’s 13th district House race to the Government Accountability Office (GAO).|$|R

5000|$|She {{used her}} {{standing}} {{to influence the}} authorities to favor the Hasidim during the [...] "anti-Hasidic investigations" [...] of 1824 that were promulgated {{by members of the}} Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment). In one instance, she helped rescind an official order barring Hasidim from visiting the tzadikim <b>by</b> personally <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> the governor of Warsaw. Hasidic leaders accorded Temerl the honorific Reb, a title traditionally given to men.|$|R

The classical virial expansion is recovered to third order as an example. ...|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, Republican {{attempts}} upstate {{to court}} votes <b>by</b> openly <b>appealing</b> <b>to</b> suspicion of New York City have usually backfired. In 1998 incumbent (and Long Island native) Republican Senator Al D'Amato's Senate campaign ran television ads in some upstate markets attempting to link his opponent, Charles Schumer, to {{a flock of}} hungry sharks released from New York City to fleece upstate. Schumer {{went on to win}} the election and did well in upstate areas.|$|R
