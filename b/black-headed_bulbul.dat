50|$|The black-capped bulbul (Pycnonotus melanicterus), or <b>black-headed</b> yellow <b>bulbul,</b> is {{a member}} of the bulbul family of {{passerine}} birds. It is endemic to Sri Lanka.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} hornbill, golden oriole, chloropsis, paradise flycatcher, golden-backed {{woodpecker}} Malabar great black woodpecker, blue-winged parakeet, fairy bluebird, jungle fowl racket-tailed drongo, peafowl, red spurfowl, grey francolin, painted spurfowl, painted bush quail, white-bellied woodpecker, lesser yellownape, golden woodpecker, streak-throated woodpecker, chestnut-headed bee-eater, emerald dove, green imperial pigeon, grey-fronted green pigeon, grey-bellied cuckoo, Indian cuckoo, alpine swift, black-hooded oriole, greater racket-tailed drongo, <b>black-headed</b> cuckooshrike, grey-headed <b>bulbul,</b> forest wagtail, crimson-backed sunbird and Loten's sunbird. It also holds the isolated southern {{population of the}} striped tit-babbler.|$|R
50|$|Literature on {{historical}} records of birdlife {{of the region}} is very scanty. Forsyth's (1889) casual remarks indicated that several species like <b>black-headed</b> yellow <b>bulbul</b> (Pycnonotus melanicterus), painted spurfowl (Galloperdix lunulata), lesser adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus), and Indian golden-backed three-toed woodpecker (Dinopium javanense) which are now found only in small restricted areas were apparently quite common and widespread around late 19th century. The recent rediscovery of the forest spotted owlet (Heteroglaux blewitti), endemic to Central Indian Highlands after about 114 years (Rasmussen 1998), underscores the significance of more avifaunal studies in the region for conservation planning. The forests of central India are {{also one of the}} few known refuges for several globally threatened and restricted-range species like Malabar pied hornbill (Anthracoceros coronatus), spotted grey creeper (Salpornis spilonotus), white-bellied minivet (Pericrocotus erythropygius), Asian brown flycatcher (Muscicapa dauurica) and green munia (Amandava formosa) (Ali & Ripley, 1983). A recent survey on breeding birds of Central Indian Highlands by Wildlife Institute of India (Jayapal et al., 2005) has added several new breeding records and range-extensions like crested goshawk (Accipiter trivirgatus), Oriental scops owl (Otus sunia), spot-bellied eagle owl (Bubo nipalensis), drongo-cuckoo (Surniculus lugubris), ashy drongo (Dicrurus leucophaeus), and striated grassbird (Megalurus palustris).|$|R
5000|$|The <b>black-headed</b> <b>bulbul</b> (Pycnonotus atriceps) is {{a member}} of the bulbul family, Pycnonotidae. It is found in forests in {{south-eastern}} Asia.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black-headed</b> <b>bulbul</b> mainly {{feeds on}} small fruit and berries, {{but will also}} take insects. It {{commonly}} occurs in small flocks, comprising 6-8 individuals.|$|E
5000|$|Resident and {{migratory birds}} are {{abundant}} inside the park. Identified species include: the jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), red-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer), {{lesser whistling duck}} (Dendrocygna javanica), Asian openbill stork (Anastomus oscitans), black-crowned night heron (Nycticonax nycticorax) and white-throated babbler (Turdoides gularis). <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Bulbul</b> ( [...] Pycnonotus atriceps) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{status of}} this rarely seen bird is not known, {{primarily}} {{because it is}} not clear whether it is in fact a distinct species, or a natural hybrid between the <b>black-headed</b> <b>bulbul</b> and the grey-bellied bulbul or other closely related bulbul. Alternate names for the blue-wattled bulbul include the Malayasian wattled bulbul, Nieuwenhuis's bulbul and wattled bulbul.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black-headed</b> <b>bulbul</b> has a mainly olive-yellow plumage with {{a glossy}} bluish-black head. A grey morph {{where most of}} the olive-yellow is {{replaced}} by grey also exists. It resembles the black-crested bulbul, but has blue eyes (though not reliable in juveniles), a broad yellow tip to the tail, and never shows a crest (however, some subspecies of the black-crested are also essentially crestless, but they have red or yellow throats).|$|E
40|$|Forest {{damage in}} any ways will {{determine}} {{all of the}} organism inside include the birds. Forest restoration is a positive step that would help to recover back the forest. Bird is one of bio-indicator of forest condition. This research was needed not only to compare the diversity of birds between restoration area and primary forest (middle and edge forest), but also to know the species of birds which could adapt in both areas. The research was conducted in June – July 2012 at Sei Betung Resort, based on the IPA (Indices Ponctuels d 2 ̆ 7 Abondence) or Point Count method. The result showed that bird diversity index in middle forest is 3, 586 {{as well as in}} edge forest is 3, 554. Both results are categorized as high diversity level, while the restoration area is categorized as middle diversity level with 3, 095 index value. Some birds were founded in both areas such as Wreathed hornbill (Aceros undulatus), Emerald dove (Chalcophaps indica), Black magpie (Platysmurus leucopterus), Short-toed coucal (Centropus rectunguis), Greater coucal (Centropus sinensis), Lesser coucal (Centropus bengalensis), Buff-rumped Woodpecker (Meiglyptes tristis), Rufous woodpecker (Celeus brachyurus), Red-breasted parakeet (Psittacula alexandri), Yellow-vented bulbul (Phycnonotus goiavier), Cream-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus simplex), <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Bulbul</b> (Pycnonotus atriceps), Red-whiskered bulbul (Pycnonotus jocosus), Ashy tailorbird (Orthotomus ruficeps), Rufous-tailed tailorbird (Orthotomus sericeus), Magpie robin (Copsychus saularis) ...|$|E
