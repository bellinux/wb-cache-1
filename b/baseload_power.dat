40|$|Wind is the world's {{fastest growing}} energy source. Because it is intermittent, though, wind {{is not used}} to supply <b>baseload</b> {{electric}} <b>power</b> currently. This article suggest that interconnecting wind farms through the transmission grid is a simple and effective way of reducing deliverable wind power swings caused by intermittency. As more wind farms are connected in an array, wind speed correlation among sites decreases {{and so does the}} probability that all sites experience the same wing regime at the same time. This study examines the benefits of interconnected wind farms at 19 sites located in the Midwestern U. S. It concluded that an average of 33 % and a maximum of 47 % of yearly averaged wind power from interconnected farms can be used a reliable, <b>baseload</b> electric <b>power.</b> Additionally the authors found that interconnecting multiple wind farms to a common point and then connecting that point to a far away city can allowed the long distance portion of capacity to be reduced by approximately 20 % with only a 1. 6 % loss of energy. www. stanford. edu/group/efmh/winds/aj 07 _jamc. pd...|$|R
25|$|Many {{existing}} hydroelectric dams {{are fairly}} old (for example, the Hoover Dam {{was built in}} the 1930s), and their original design predated the newer intermittent power sources such as wind and solar by decades. A hydroelectric dam originally built to provide <b>baseload</b> <b>power</b> will have its generators sized according to the average flow of water into the reservoir. Uprating such a dam with additional generators increases its peak power output capacity, thereby increasing its capacity to operate as a virtual grid energy storage unit. The United States Bureau of Reclamation reports an investment cost of $69 per kilowatt capacity to uprate an existing dam, compared to more than $400 per kilowatt for oil-fired peaking generators. While an uprated hydroelectric dam does not directly store excess energy from other generating units, it behaves equivalently by accumulating its own fuel – incoming river water – during periods of high output from other generating units. Functioning as a virtual grid storage unit in this way, the uprated dam {{is one of the most}} efficient forms of energy storage, because it has no pumping losses to fill its reservoir, only increased losses to evaporation and leakage.|$|E
2500|$|For {{many years}} {{there was a}} {{consensus}} within the electric utilities in the U.S. that renewable electricity generators such as wind and solar are so unreliable and intermittent that they {{will never be able}} to contribute significantly to electric supply or provide <b>baseload</b> <b>power.</b> Thomas Petersnik, an analyst with the U.S. Energy Information Administration put it this way: [...] "by and large, renewable energy sources are too rare, too distant, too uncertain, and too ill-timed to provide significant supplies at times and places of need".|$|E
50|$|Each <b>baseload</b> <b>power</b> {{plant on}} a grid is allotted a {{specific}} {{amount of the}} <b>baseload</b> <b>power</b> demand to handle.

50|$|One of the {{challenges}} with using wind to replace natural gas is the intermittent nature of wind energy, since the same wind conditions are not always present. According to a 2007 study by Archer & Jacobson published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, interconnecting ten or more widely separated wind farms allows 33 to 47% of the total energy produced (15-20% of nominal capacity) {{to be used as}} reliable, <b>baseload</b> electric <b>power,</b> as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height.|$|R

Interconnecting wind farms through the transmission grid is a simple and effective way of reducing deliverable wind power swings caused by wind intermittency. As more farms are interconnected in an array, wind speed correlation among sites decreases {{and so does the}} probability that all sites experience the same wind regime at the same time. Consequently, the array behaves more and more similarly to a single farm with steady wind speed and thus steady deliverable wind power. In this study, benefits of interconnecting wind farms were evaluated for 19 sites, located in the Midwestern United States, with annual average wind speeds at 80 m above ground, the hub height of modern wind turbines, greater than 6. 9 m/s (class 3 or greater). We found that an average of 33 % and a maximum of 47 % of yearly-averaged wind power from interconnected farms can be used as reliable, <b>baseload</b> electric <b>power.</b> Equally significant, interconnecting multiple wind farms to a common point, then connecting that point to a far-away city can allow the long-distance portion of transmission capacity to be reduced, for example, by 20 % with only a 1. 6 % loss of energy. 2 Although most parameters, such as intermittency, improved less than linearly as the number of interconnected sites increased, no saturation of the benefits was found. Thus, the benefits of interconnection continue to increase with more and more interconnected sites. 3 1...|$|R

5000|$|Performance-based {{regulation}} {{of greenhouse gases}} from electricity generation has been initiated on the state level. California {{was the first to}} implement this standard in January 2007 by adopting Senate Bill 1368, which set a limit of 1,100 lbs.

This legislation was intended to apply to new plant investments (new construction), new or renewal contracts with a term of five years or more, or major investments by the electrical utility in its existing <b>baseload</b> <b>power</b> plants. The number of 1,100 lbs. CO2/MWhr corresponds to the emissions per electrical output of a combined cycle gas turbine plant. By comparison, coal-fired steam turbine plants produce 2,200 lbs.

40|$|AbstractWe {{estimated}} the human cost of {{failures in the}} CCS industry in 2050, using the actuarial approach. The range of expected fatalities is assessed integrating all steps of the CCS chain: additional coal production, coal transportation, carbon capture, transport, injection and storage, based on empirical evidence from technical or social analogues. The main finding is that a few hundred fatalities per year should be expected if the technology is used to avoid emitting 3. 67 GtCO 2 yr- 1 in 2050 at <b>baseload</b> coal <b>power</b> plants. The large majority of fatalities are attributable to mining and delivering more coal. These risks compare to today's industrial hazards: technical, knowable and occupational dangers for which there are socially acceptable non-zero risk levels. Some contemporary European societies tolerate about one fatality per thousand year around industrial installations. If storage sites perform like that, then expected fatalities per year due to leakage should have a minor contribution in the total expected fatalities per year: less than one. But to statistically validate such a safety level, reliability theory and the technology roadmap suggest that CO 2 storage demonstration projects over the next 20 years have to cause exactly zero fatality...|$|R
