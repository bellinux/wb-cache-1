5|$|The <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes at {{the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock <b>Braking</b> <b>System</b> and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
5|$|During the Blizzard of 1996, on January 6, a Metro {{operator}} {{was killed}} when a train failed {{to stop at the}} Shady Grove station. The four-car train overran the station platform and struck an unoccupied train that was awaiting assignment. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found that the crash was a result of a failure in the train's computer-controlled <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b> The NTSB recommended that Metro grant train operators the ability to manually control the <b>braking</b> <b>system,</b> even in inclement weather, and recommended that Metro prohibit parked rail cars on tracks used by incoming outbound trains.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Air <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been}} widely used in heavy trucks and {{intercity}} buses for its great superiority over other <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> In traditional, many researchers focused on the vehicle dynamics which employ the static characteristic of <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> to analysis the vehicle brake capacity. In fact, the practical performance of air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> may be greatly different from the static theory. Thus, it is necessary to build an integrate air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> model to simulate the process of brake accurately. Also, some works focused on the dynamic characteristics of <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> have been completed, but it is not comprehensive without the considering the effect of vehicle dynamics. In this paper, a completely air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> dynamic model is built, where the air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> contains pneumatic subsystem and mechanical subsystem. The air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> is embedded in a heavy truck dynamic model which contains three axles.

40|$|Air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> {{has been}} widely used in heavy trucks and {{intercity}} buses for its great superiority over other <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> The practical performance of air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> may be greatly different from if we analyze it with static theory.

However, the dynamic mathematic model of air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> is very complicate, which makes the model hard to be solved. In this paper, the components of air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> are decomposed to several basic standard pneumatic components, and then build the system based on these basic standard pneumatic components. The standard pneumatic components which are built in the software-MWorks based on Modelica language include cylinder, nozzle, air reservoir, volume, and air pipe.

5|$|In November 2010, the Accident Investigation Board Norway {{criticized the}} <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> of the trains. During 2009, there were 83 {{incidents}} where trains with locked wheels slid down steep sections of track. The Accident Investigation Board {{found that the}} metro had conducted insufficient testing of the <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> on steep slippery lines, had not adjusted the brakes satisfactorily, and had not maintained the trains and tracks sufficiently. In December 2010, Oslo Vognselskap ordered another 32 three-car units, bringing the total order up to 115 three-car units. The last trains will be delivered in 2012. There was political disagreement regarding the final purchase, with the Liberal Party and socialist opposition securing a majority for the purchase, while the right-winged parties voted to order 19 units. The extra trains {{will make it possible}} to run all lines except the Holmenkollen Line (Line 1) with six-car lines, compared to a situation with only three-car trains on the Lambertseter Line, the Ring Line and the Kolsås Line (lines 4 and 6) would only use three-car trains.|$|E

One person was killed and four were seriously injured, leading to a safety inspection of the old teak cars used on the line; the HkB 600units were withdrawn from service, but were reintroduced after some refits.|$|E

40|$|Abstract：The {{full power}} {{hydraulic}} <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> has several advantages over traditional <b>brake</b> actuation <b>systems.</b> These systems {{are capable of}} supplying fluid {{to a range of}} very small and large volume service brakes with actuation that is faster than air/hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>systems.</b> Implementation of full power hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> in off-road vehicles calls for good understanding of its dynamic characteristics. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic modeling of the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> and develop a dynamic model for a hydraulic brake valve. First, the dynamic characteristics of full power hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> are analyzed theoretically. The effects of varying design parameters (brake valve, accumulator and so on) and the different operating conditions are then analyzed. Second, we investigate the dynamic characteristics of a full power hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> using a test bench, which is a loader <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> specifically designed for one construction Machinery Company. Finally, based on the experimental results, the mathematical models are amended and verified. The result shows that the model-calculated data agree well with tested data. The dynamic behavior of hydraulic valve can be well predicted with the model. The simplified models {{can be applied to the}} studies of full power hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> dynamics...|$|R
5|$|When B {{was first}} founded, the linear {{magnetic}} eddy brake {{had yet to}} be developed, so it used friction brakes as its main <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b> On the train, pads are fitted beneath the seating areas. On the brakes, similar pads are connected to steel supports. When the pads on the train come into contact with the brakes, friction is created which slows the train. Beginning with Kumba in 1993, friction brakes have also been used as trim brakes that regulate the speed of the train while it is still navigating the course.|$|E

The vehicle also has a regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b> The electrical power from the generator is sent primarily to the electric motor, with the excess going to the batteries, depending {{on the state of}} charge (SOC) of the battery pack and the power demanded at the wheels.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a Dive Coaster can vary {{slightly}} from one to another. Depending on the amusement park's request, one row on the train can seat anywhere from 6 to 10 riders. Stadium seating {{is also used to}} give every rider a clear view. Next, compared to standard Bolliger & Mabillard 4 abreast cars, because of the extra weight of each car on a Dive Coaster, the size of the track must be larger than other B models (such as the Hyper Coaster) to support the weight. At the top of the primary vertical drop, a <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> holds the train for 3 to 5 seconds, giving riders a view of the drop ahead before being released into the drop.|$|E

5|$|The trains {{were put}} back into service on 13 July. The trains were only allowed {{to operate at}} {{conventional}} speeds and {{had to go through}} a weekly inspection. At the same time, NSB removed the surcharge on the Signatur services. NSB stated that they were considering revocation the purchase of the four trains which were still to be delivered. In addition to problems with axles, there were also issues with the braking and air conditioning systems. In mid-August, the tilting mechanism was disabled on all the trains because of a fault in a bearing in the connection between the bogie and the body which allowed for a movement of several millimetres (at least 0.1 in). In late August, problems occurred with the <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> causing the trains to automatically brake even when not receiving such signals from the automatic train stop system.|$|E

Next, the car's suspension was tested over different types of road surfaces, including German and Belgian blocks & cobblestones. Next, the car's anti-lock <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> was turned off and the car tried to navigate a course of cones, knocking many over in the process. The anti-lock brakes were then turned back on and a similar cone course was navigated easily. Guests were shown a video overlay of the difference.

40|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>systems</b> for {{motorcycles}} {{are available}} in many different designs with different technical solutions.
