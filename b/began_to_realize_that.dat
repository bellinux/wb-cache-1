5|$|Events at Ulm {{were now}} {{reaching}} a conclusion. On 15 October Ney's troops successfully charged the Michelsberg encampments {{and on the}} 16th the French began to bombard Ulm itself. Austrian morale was at a low point and Mack <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> there was little hope of rescue. On 17 October Napoleon's emissary, Ségur, signed a convention with Mack in which the Austrians agreed to surrender on 25 October if no aid came by that date. Gradually, however, Mack heard of the capitulations at Heidenheim and Neresheim and agreed to surrender five days before schedule on 20 October. Fifteen hundred troops from the Austrian garrison managed to escape, {{but the vast majority}} of the Austrian force marched out on 21 October and laid down their arms without incident, all with the Grande Armée drawn up in a vast semicircle observing the capitulation (see infobox picture). The officers were permitted to leave, pending their signatures on a parole in which they agreed not to take up arms against France until they were exchanged. More than ten general officers were included in this agreement, including Mack, Johann von Klenau, Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, Prince Liechtenstein, and Ignaz Gyulai.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit {{drinking}} in 1972, {{and at first}} Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it. It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he always kept a bottle with him. Vainio <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E

25|$|Alexios IV soon <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> {{the generous}} offer promised to the Crusaders {{would not be}} met. He had managed to pay roughly half of the promised amount of 200,000 silver marks – whilst this had paid of the {{original}} 34,000 marks that the Crusaders were endebted, the Venetians had since demanded more money from the Crusade since their fleet was leased out for far longer than expected (due to the numerous diversions). Making matters worse was Alexius IV's promise that he would cover the Venetians' rent of the fleet for the crusaders.|$|E
25|$|In 1854 the British Admiralty ordered 4,000 Navy Model Colt revolvers. In 1855 the British Army {{placed an}} order for 5,000 of these revolvers for army issue. Despite a {{following}} order {{later in the year}} for an additional 9,000 revolvers, Colt failed to convince the British to adopt his revolver as the issue sidearm for the army. Colt <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> British sales were failing to meet his expectations. Unable to justify the London factory’s expenses, Colt closed the London factory in 1856. Over the next few months his workmen crated and shipped the machinery and disassembled firearms back to America.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} decades of the 19th century further changes in {{northern}} Westchester negatively affected the West Somers church. The railroads began to spur suburbanization, as city residents who originally spent their summers and weekends in the area <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> they could live there full-time and commute to their jobs in the city via train. The growing city, in need of water, began acquiring large tracts of land, sometimes including whole communities, in the area through eminent domain, reducing {{the total amount of}} land available for development and thus driving up the value of what remained. This induced many of the area's farmers, the population from which West Somers had grown, to sell their farms for subdivision and development.|$|E

25|$|On October 8, {{the armies}} met {{unexpectedly}} at the Battle of Perryville; they had skirmished {{the previous day}} as they were searching for water sources in the vicinity. Bragg ordered the wing of his army under Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk to attack {{what he thought was}} an isolated portion of Buell's command, but had difficulty motivating Polk to begin the fight until Bragg arrived in person. Eventually Polk attacked the corps of Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook on the Union army's left flank and forced it to fall back. By the end of the day, McCook had been driven back about a mile, but reinforcements had arrived to stabilize the line, and Bragg only then <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> his limited tactical victory in the bloody battle had been against less than half of Buell's army and the remainder was arriving quickly.|$|E
25|$|The late 1960s brought {{big changes}} in the {{programming}} practices of the major television networks. As baby boomers reached adulthood, NBC, CBS and ABC <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> much of their existing programming had not only been running for years, but had audiences that skewed older. In order to attract the large youth population that was highly attractive to advertisers, the networks moved to clean house {{of a number of}} veteran shows. In NBC's case, this included programs like The Bell Telephone Hour and Sing Along With Mitch, which both had an average viewer age of 50. During this period, the networks came to define adults between the ages of 18 and 49 as their main target audience, although depending on the show, this could be subdivided into other age demos: 35–45, 18–25 or 18–35. Regardless of the exact target demographic, the general idea was to appeal to viewers who were not close to retirement age and to modernize television programming, which the networks felt overall was stuck in a 1950s mentality, to closely resemble contemporary American society.|$|E
25|$|At age 17, Tajiri {{began writing}} and editing a fanzine called Game Freak from 1981 to 1986, {{focusing}} on the arcade game scene. Game Freak was handwritten and stapled together. Nonetheless, Ken Sugimori, who later illustrated the first 151 Pokémon, saw the magazine at a dōjinshi shop, and became involved. As more contributors came to Game Freak, Tajiri <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> most games were lacking in quality, and he and Sugimori decided the solution was {{to make their own}} games. Tajiri studied the Family BASIC game programming package, to better grasp the concepts of Famicom game design. He then purchased the requisite hardware for game development. Tajiri and Sugimori evolved the magazine into the video game development company Game Freak in 1989. Soon after, the two pitched their first game, an arcade-style game called Quinty, to Namco, who published the game. Tajiri also wrote as a freelance writer for the magazine Famicom Hisshōbon, later called Hippon, and reviewed arcade games for Family Computer Magazine and Famicom Tsūshin.|$|E

25|$|Early on {{the morning}} of May 2, Hooker <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> Lee's actions on May 1 had not been {{constrained}} by the threat of Sedgwick's force at Fredericksburg, so no further deception was needed on that front. He decided to summon the I Corps of Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds to reinforce his lines at Chancellorsville. His intent was that Reynolds would form up {{to the right of the}} XI Corps and anchor the Union right flank on the Rapidan River. Given the communications chaos of May 1, Hooker was under the mistaken impression that Sedgwick had withdrawn back across the Rappahannock and, based on this, that the VI Corps should remain on the north bank of the river across from the town, where it could protect the army's supplies and supply line. (In fact, both Reynolds and Sedgwick were still west of the Rappahannock, south of the town.) Hooker sent his orders at 1:55a.m., expecting that Reynolds would be able to start marching before daylight, but problems with his telegraph communications delayed the order to Fredericksburg until just before sunrise. Reynolds was forced to make a risky daylight march. By the afternoon of May 2, when Hooker expected him to be digging in on the Union right at Chancellorsville, Reynolds was still marching to the Rappahannock.|$|E
500|$|Following the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861 (the {{first major}} {{engagement}} {{of the war}} and a disastrous defeat for the untested Union army), citizens of the northern states <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the Civil War would not end quickly. Additional troops would be needed beyond the 75,000 volunteers that had been called out for 90 days of service. As a result, over the summer of 1861, volunteers rushed to enlist for a term of three years. The 21st Massachusetts was among the [...] "three year regiments" [...] organized after the First Battle of Bull Run.|$|E

500|$|The {{great auk}} was an {{important}} part of many Native American cultures, both as a food source and as a symbolic item. Many Maritime Archaic people were buried with great auk bones. One burial discovered included someone covered by more than 200 great auk beaks, which are presumed to be the remnants of a cloak made of great auk skins. Early European explorers to the Americas used the great auk as a convenient food source or as fishing bait, reducing its numbers. The bird's down was in high demand in Europe, a factor that largely eliminated the European populations by the mid-16th century. Scientists soon <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the great auk was disappearing and it became the beneficiary of many early environmental laws, but this proved ineffectual.|$|E
500|$|In the 19th century astronomers <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> {{recently}} discovered bodies {{that had been}} classified as planets for {{almost half a century}} (such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta) were very different from the traditional ones. These bodies shared the same region of space between Mars and Jupiter (the asteroid belt), and had a much smaller mass; as a result they were reclassified as [...] "asteroids". In the absence of any formal definition, a [...] "planet" [...] came to be understood as any [...] "large" [...] body that orbited the Sun. Because there was a dramatic size gap between the asteroids and the planets, and the spate of new discoveries seemed to have ended after the discovery of Neptune in 1846, there was no apparent need to have a formal definition.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{creation}} of Dallas, series creator David Jacobs originally had quite a different idea of what he envisioned the show to be. He {{wanted to create a}} television show based on [...] "family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level". The Production Company, CBS, initially turned down his original idea, as they wanted something more [...] "glitzy" [...] to put on the air, with wealthier characters. After the success of Dallas, Jacobs' initial idea would later become the Dallas spin-off Knots Landing. He initially conceived Pamela as the central character of the Texas-based serial. The role was initially created specifically for actress Linda Evans to star, and was indefinitely called [...] "The Untitled Linda Evans Project" [...] that was originally set in Indianapolis. He described her character as, [...] "a semitrashy lady who marries into a rich Texas family". After crafting the backstory of the Ewing family, Jacobs <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the show couldn't be settled simply around the character of Pamela. He wanted it to be based around the entire clan and their lives as wealthy oil people living in Dallas, Texas. Evans was ultimately not offered the part, but ironically would later go on to play Krystle Carrington on Dynasty, a rival show to Dallas.|$|E
