40|$|The <b>ball</b> <b>cratering</b> {{test was}} used to study the {{abrasive}} wear resistance {{of a wide variety of}} coatings against TiO 2 Particles. The rutile TiO 2, used as white pigment, causes mild abrasive wear in mixers, dyes, injection moulds and other components in the paint and plastic processing. The tests yield a clear ranking of the coatings. The abrasive wear due to the rutile particles is also compared to the wear induced by SiC particles commonly used for <b>ball</b> <b>cratering</b> tests. Differences in the wear mechanism using the latter are demonstrated. Furthermore, the calculation methods to derive the coating and substrate wear coefficients from the wear volume measurements have been critically reviewed. It can be concluded that the methods are especially useful for determining the wear coefficient in the coating. However, the substrate wear coefficient cannot be accurately determined when the wear resistance of the substrate is much lower than that of the coating. It is shown that the <b>ball</b> <b>cratering</b> test is not restricted to polished samples, but remains useful for moderate roughness as applicable to the desired components. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|<b>Ball</b> <b>cratering</b> and {{rotating}} wheel {{tests are}} useful techniques for abrasive wear resistance evaluation of thin coatings. Nevertheless, such techniques involve significant experimental errors, coming from equipment deficiencies {{and changes in}} wear response depending on test parameters. In case of rotating wheel test, common instrumental errors are: geometry-induced errors (curved or non-horizontal sample surface), alignment errors (misalignment between ball/wheel rotation axis and sample stage) and optical measurement errors. In the present paper, errors due to crater dimension detection system (penetration depth or crater diameter) and equipment deficiencies (rotating axes misalignment and sample slope) were numerically analysed. A general expression for volume calculation was obtained, considering axes misalignment and sample slope, and experimentally validated by wear tests on Ti/TiN CAE-PVD coatings and profilometer abraded volumes measurement. Results showed that axes misalignment and sample slope involve considerable errors in wear coefficient evaluation. However, errors can be corrected {{by the use of}} obtained expressions.

The proposal of a pre-standard (ENV- 1071 - 2) has been submitted to the European standardisation organization CEN.

The global composite wear after coating perforation is generally assumed to be a linear convolution of the substrate and the coating wear rates. It is shown that the applicability of such an approach depends on the local damage mechanisms in the coating and at the coating/substrate interface. In the case of high hardness DLC on steel or titanium alloy substrates, load carrying continues to be dominated by close to two body scoring abrasion insured by the highly wear resistant DLC annulus, while in the perforated centre rolling contact between the abrasive slurry and the substrate material prevails...|$|E

Sliding friction test {{was carried out in}} a pin-on-disk system. A micro-abrasion test was performed using the <b>ball</b> <b>cratering</b> methods. The erosion test consisted an air stream carrying abrasive particles of SiC, impinging flat samples. Sizes of wear scars were determined by optical microscopy and laser profilometry.

40|$|Titanium nitride (TiN) {{coatings}} {{are widely}} used in machining because of its mechanical characteristics which modify {{the surface of the}} substrate increasing the capacity of load support and reduction of friction, while a coating as diamond-like carbon (DLC), which also has interesting mechanical properties, needs better attention. In this sense, the development of new coatings such as DLC is as important as wear analysis techniques. This work discusses the methods available to assess abrasive wear of coatings. For this, it has been used the data of the crater volume formed in <b>ball</b> <b>cratering</b> test and compared the difference between the specific wear coefficients of substrate and coating (ks and kc).

40|$|Fe-C-Mo and Fe-C-Cr steels were {{sintered}} by PM processes carried out using different values of temperature and pressure, leading to different microstructures and density values. Flat specimens were submitted to tribological tests {{in order to}} evaluate their behaviour under both dry sliding and abrasive wear conditions. A flat-on-cylinder tribometer {{was used for the}} slidingtests, while a micro-scale <b>ball</b> <b>cratering</b> device was used for the abrasiontests. The dry slidingwear resistance of the PM steels was mainly influenced by the composition and sintering conditions. In this regard, the best behavior was observed for the more hardenable Fe-C-Mo steels with higher Mo content, sintered under conditions giving rise to bainitic microstructures. A determining role was also played by the porosity content and pore shape: reduction in porosity (obtained by increasing the sintering temperature and the compacting pressure), as well as an increase in pore roundness, led to a significant improvement in the resistance to slidingwear. A mild oxidative wear regime were observed for all the sinteredsteels under relatively low values of the applied load, while an increase of the applied load led to a delamination wear regime.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a wear study of {{innovative}} Ti-Ta alloys is present. Samples of Ti- 30 %Ta, Ti- 52 %Ta, were produced by laser cladding. This technology uses a high power density {{generated by a}} laser beam to melt the base material and the filler material. The interaction between the laser and the substrate {{is a function of}} the radiation absorption properties of the material and that conditions the heat flow. Laser technology allows working with high temperatures and melting powders of titanium and the alloying elements as tantalum. As this is a continuous process enables rapid cooling of the molten material and the consequent solidification. The principal importance of these innovative alloys is the low Young’s Modulus, the closest to Young´s Modulus of the bone, the biocompatibility of titanium and tantalum and consequently its applicability to biomedical industry.

40|$|Abstract. Surface {{coatings}} of Al-Si/SiC metal-matrix composites were {{deposited on}} Al- 7 wt. % Si alloy substrates by laser cladding. The microstructure of the coatings {{was characterized by}} optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The microstructure of the coating material is profoundly influenced by the processing parameters used, in particular by the particle injection velocity and by the specific energy. When the injection velocity is low or specific energy is high excessive dissolution of SiC in the melt pool occurs. The microstructure of the coatings presents partially dissolved SiC particles, and considerable proportions of Al 4 SiC 4 plates and faceted Si equiaxed crystals dispersed in a α-Al+Si eutectic matrix. On the contrary for high injection velocity or low specific energy dissolution of SiC is very limited and the microstructure of the coatings consists essentially of undissolved SiC particles in a matrix consisting of primary α-Al dendrites and α-Al+Si eutectic. Abrasive wear tests were performed on the coatings using a <b>ball</b> <b>cratering</b> device and a 35 wt. % suspension of 4. 25 μm average diameter SiC particles in water as abrasive. Coatings prepared with a high specific energy present an average hardness of 248 HV and an average abrasive wear rate of 17. 4 x 10 - 5 mm 3 /m.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a theoretical model and associated wear mode map to identify the regimes in which two body abrasion (grooving abrasion) and three body abrasion (rolling abrasion) dominate in the micro-abrasive wear test (also known as the <b>ball</b> <b>cratering</b> wear test). This test is generally considered to be a three body wear test. The wear mechanisms and wear rates were investigated using diamond abrasive over a range of loads (0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 2 N), and slurry concentrations (0. 05, 0. 1, and 0. 2 volume fraction abrasive). It was found that during abrasion wear, a transition from grooving to rolling wear could be identified for a load with respect to time. The critical condition for the transition between two-body and three-body abrasion was determined from a continuum mechanics model for the penetration of the abrasive particles into the surfaces of the ball and the specimen, coupled with considerations of equilibrium. Two wear modes are usually observed in this type of test: ‘rolling abrasion’ results when the abrasive particles roll on the surface of the tested specimen, while ‘grooving abrasion’ is observed when the abrasive particles slide; the type of wear mode has a significant effect on the overall behaviour of a tribological system. Wear rates of metallic samples were determined and the worn surfaces were examined by optical microscopy, SEM and Talysurf proﬁlometry...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{influence}} of the processing conditions on the microstructure and abrasive wear behaviour of a NiCrBSi hardfacing alloy is analysed. The hardfacing alloy was applied in the form of coatings onto a mild steel substrate (Fe- 0. 15 %C) by different techniques: laser cladding (LC) and flame spraying (FS) combined with surface flame melting (SFM). In both cases, the appropriate selection of the process parameters enabled high-quality, defect-free NiCrBSi coatings to be obtained. The microstructure of the coatings was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), with attached energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) microprobe, and by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Their tribological properties were evaluated by micro-scale <b>ball</b> <b>cratering</b> abrasive wear tests using different abrasives: diamond, SiC and WC. Microstructural characterisation showed that both coatings exhibit similar phases in their microstructure, but the phases present differ in morphology, size distribution and relative proportions from one coating to another. Wear tests showed that in three-body abrasive conditions, despite these microstructural differences, the wear behaviour is comparable for both coatings. Conversely, in two-body wear conditions with diamond particles as the abrasive, it was observed that the specific wear rate of the material is sensitive to microstructural changes. This fact is particularly apparent in LC coatings, in which the zones of the layers with higher proportions of very small hard particles present a lower wear resistance. These results indicate {{that it is important to}} have good microstructural control of this material, in order to obtain coatings with an optimized and homogeneous tribological behaviour. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|Micro-blasting on PVD films {{has been}} documented, among others, as an {{efficient}} method for inducing compressive stresses, thus {{for increasing the}} coating hardness and potentially tool life of coated tools. Since contradictory results have been registered concerning the efficiency of wet micro-blasting on coated tools for improving the wear behaviour, the paper aims at explaining how this process can be successfully applied for post-treatment of PVD films. In this context, the employed conditions such as pressure and grain size affect significantly the wear resistance of the micro-blasted coated tools. In the described investigations, TiAlN coatings were post-treated through wet micro-blasting by Al 2 O 3 abrasives of various grains' diameter. Abrasion mechanisms after micro-blasting were investigated by roughness measurements. Nanoindentations on micro-blasted film surfaces at various pressures revealed the influence of this process on coating superficial hardness. The relat ed residual stress changes were estimated considering the film yield stress alterations, which were analytically determined, based on nanoindentation results. Nano-impact tests were conducted for investigating {{the effect of the}} developed film compressive stresses at certain micro-blasting pressures and grain sizes on the film's brittleness. To monitor film thickness and cutting edge radius changes of coatings subjected to micro-blasting, <b>ball</b> <b>cratering</b> tests and white light scans were carried out respectively.

40|$|Thick {{composite}} coatings of carbides (e. g. WC) in a {{metal matrix}} are ideal for components subject to heavy abrasive wear. An emerging deposition technique for such wear resistant cemented carbide coatings is laser cladding. This technique has, contrary to surface welding and spraying methods, the potential to coat very locally and on highly complex components. Adhesion and damage resistance is also improved by laser cladding. In this paper the influence of carbide particle size and distribution on the wear resistance of laser clad coatings is discussed. A nickel based matrix reinforced with WC/W 2 C carbides is deposited by a CO 2 laser on low carbon steel substrates. Different coatings are made with three different particle sizes of the carbides and volume fractions ranging from 0 up to 50 %. Three different wear modes are evaluated. First, ball-on-disc tests with an Al 2 O 3 ball have been performed. The <b>ball</b> <b>cratering</b> test with 4 mum SiC abrasive is used to assess mild abrasive wear. Finally, the resistance against severe two body abrasion is tested in a pin-on-disc test. A clear dependency of the wear resistance on the carbide concentration is found, which is more pronounced for the coatings with the finest WC/W 2 C carbides. The magnitude of the decrease in wear however is highly dependent on the wear mode. In two body abrasion and in the sliding wear, {{a small amount of}} carbides is sufficient to improve the wear resistance drastically. Other coating characteristics such as microstructure, hardness and internal stress are assessed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Provide {{tribological}} {{information about}} the applicability of multi-layer carbon-chromium composite coatings to gears. Discuss the protection provided against scuffing failures, wear and the influence on gear power losses. Design/methodology/approach – Several screening tests, such as Rockwell indentations, <b>ball</b> <b>cratering,</b> pin-on-disc and reciprocating wear tests, were performed in order to evaluate the adhesion to the substrate and the tribological performance of the carbon/chromium composite coating. Afterwards, twin-disc tests were performed at high contact pressure and high slide-to-roll ratios to confirm the good adhesive and tribological {{properties of the coating}} under operating conditions similar to those found in gears. Gear tests were performed in the FZG machine in order to evaluate the anti-scuffing performance of the carbon/chromium coating using additive free gear oils. Finally, the carbon/chromium composite coating was also applied to the gearing in a gearbox and its influence on the gearbox efficiency was analysed. Findings – The C/Cr has got very good adhesion to the steel substrate, provides low friction coefficients between contacting solids in relative movement, gives excellent protection against scuffing and wear reduction in gears, and promotes a slight improvement of the gears efficiency. Research limitations/implications – The protection of this carbon/chromium coating against gear micro-pitting should be investigated. Practical implications – This study confirms the applicability of this coating to industrial gear applications, especially in two particular applications: severe applications involving high contact pressures and high sliding, frequent start-ups and inefficient lubrication; and acting as tribo-reactive material and substituting non-biodegradable and toxic additives in environmental lubricants.

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of metal rich core of the {{droplets}} on the corrosion properties of TiN, CrN and ZrN arc evaporated nitride coatings has been investigated and the corrosion properties of such coatings have been compared with droplet free, highly dense coatings grown by combined high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS) and direct current magnetron sputtering (DCMS) technique. An industrial size Hauzer HTC 1000 - 4 system enabled with HIPIMS technology {{was used for the}} deposition of combined HIPIMS/DCMS coatings. The corrosion behaviour of the coatings was studied by potentiodynamic polarisation test (ACM instruments Gill AC potentiostat, - 1 V to + 1 V) using 3. 5 % NaCl solution. Initially, as-deposited arc evaporated coatings with an exposed surface area of 1 cm 2 were subjected to corrosion. Then, the coatings were gently polished to expose the metal rich core of the droplets. Subsequently, fresh un-corroded area of the polished coating was subjected to corrosion with previously corroded area masked. It has been found that mechanical polishing considerably deteriorated the corrosion performance of arc coatings by forming more than one galvanic couple between the two parts (metal rich, nitrogen rich) of the same droplet itself or between the metal rich part of the and the adjoining coating/exposed substrate. It has been further demonstrated that the droplet free highly dense HIPIMS/DCMS coatings exhibited superior corrosion resistance as compared to the arc-evaporated coatings. Raman analysis was used to study the constituents of the corrosion products. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, planar view) was used to examine the as-deposited and corroded coating surfaces to define morphological differences.

40|$|Surface {{coatings}} of an Al-Si-SiC composite {{were produced}} on UNS A 03560 cast Al-alloy substrates by laser cladding using {{a mixture of}} powders of Al- 12 wt. % Si alloy and SiC. The microstructure of the coatings depends considerably on the processing parameters. For a specific energy of 26 MJ/m 2 the microstructure consists of SiC particles dispersed in a matrix consisting of primary α-Al dendrites and interdendritic α-Al+Si eutectic. For higher specific energies (58 and 87 MJ/m 2) SiC reacts and dissolves partially in molten aluminum, leading to a microstructure consisting of primary Al 4 SiC 4 and Si and {{a small fraction of}} undissolved SiC particles dispersed in the matrix. Abrasive wear tests were performed on the coatings using a <b>ball</b> <b>cratering</b> device and a suspension of SiC particles (35 wt. % of SiC with an average particle diameter of 4. 25 μm) in water as abrasive. The coatings deposited with a low specific energy (26 MJ/m 2) exhibit an abrasive wear rate of 0. 43 x 10 - 4 mm 3 /m and a hardness of 120 HV, while those prepared with higher specific energy (58 MJ/m 2) present a higher wear rate (1. 7 x 10 - 4 mm 3 /m) despite their higher hardness (250 HV). These results show that Al 4 SiC 4 and Si increase the hardness of the material by dispersion hardening but do not contribute to its abrasive wear resistance, because they are softer than the abrasive particles, and confirm that the parameters used to prepare Al-Si-SiC composite coatings by laser cladding must be selected so that only minimal reactions occur between SiC and molten Al. Microploughing and microcutting are the main material removal mechanisms in all samples. Whenever they exist in sufficient proportion, SiC reinforcement particles stop the grooving action of the abrasive, thus decreasing material loss. There is also some evidence of an increased contribution of microcutting as compared to microploughing in samples prepared with high specific energy, an effect that contributes to decrease their wear resistance...|$|E

Coatings were deposited on 1 micron polished M 2 High speed steel, 304 L Stainless steel and on Si (100) specimens. Prior to deposition, HIPIMS plasma sustained on a Zirconium (Zr) target was utilised to pretreat the specimens. Coatings were deposited at 400 °C in a mixed N 2 and Ar atmosphere using 2 magnetrons in HIPIMS mode and at three different substrate bias voltages (UBIAS) keeping all other process parameters constant. The thicknesses of the coatings measured by the <b>ball</b> <b>cratering</b> technique were {{in the range of}} 1. 84 µm, 1. 96 µm and 2. 13 µm at bias voltages of - 95 V, - 75 V and - 65 volts respectively, where the difference in thickness {{can be attributed to the}} re-sputtering effect. X-ray diffraction experiments on SS specimens revealed a dominating 111 texture for all three coatings irrespective of the bias voltage. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy revealed extremely dense coating structures at all bias voltages, similar to the transition zone structure (Zone T) reported by Thornton. The - 95 bias voltage coatings appeared extremely smooth on the top and with no dome shaped structures often associated with low ion bombardment during deposition. HIPIMS pretreatment lead to high adhesion (LC) of the coatings to the substrate. A continuous ductile perforation of the coating was observed at progressive loads greater than 65 N however no spallation of the coating was observed up to loads of 100 N. High values of hardness (40. 4 GPa), Young's Modulus (424 GPa) and compressive stress (10 GPa) were recorded for coatings deposited at - 95 BV. Hardness and internal stress of the coating was found increasing with more negative bias voltages. All the coatings exhibited high dry sliding wear resistance (KC) in the range of 6 x 10 - 15 m 3 N- 1 m- 1.

However, symptoms such as inflammation, tissue necrosis and metal sensitivity have been reported for some patients with MOM joints, which {{may be associated with}} the liberated metal debris and the elevated metal ion levels from such joints. Therefore, there is a requirement to assess the tribocorrosion performance of the CoCrMo alloy in physiological environments. In this study, the wear corrosion of cast CoCrMo, more specifically, sliding wear corrosion and abrasive wear corrosion (using ? 4 ?m SiC abrasive particles) have been investigated using a modified <b>ball</b> <b>cratering</b> rig with a three-electrode electrochemical cell. The concentration effects of proteinaceous material (25 and 50 % bovine serum) and pH levels, i. e. pH 4 · 0 (the pH for an infected joint area) and pH 7 · 4 (the normal pH for a healthy joint) on the tribo-corrosion performance of the alloy are explored. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have been deployed to study the protein adsorption/corrosion of the alloy under static, non-abrasive conditions, whereas in situ electrochemical current noise measurements were employed to quantify the mechanoelectrochemical mechanisms present in the tribocorrosion of the alloy under dynamic conditions. In general, protein adsorption was found to be dependent on pH and protein concentration. Protein adsorption in turn influenced the overall tribocorrosion performance of the CoCrMo alloy, including the in situ electrochemical current noise, the specific wear rates, as well as the wear scar morphologies. The presence of bovine serum enhanced the separation of the bearing surfaces and for the sliding wear corrosion the wear rate was markedly reduced. However, the bovine serum appeared to increase the abrasive particle entrainment and lead to accelerated wear in the presence of abrasive particles (abrasive wear). For the more acidic physiological environment, in comparison to pH 7 · 4, higher corrosion rates occurred under wear corrosion conditions leading to increased metal ion release. Consequently, the proteins and the pH level of hip joint environments {{play a significant role in}} the tribocorrosion performance of the cast CoCrMo and a discussion of the combined wear and corrosion mechanisms will be presented...|$|E

This highlights themes relevant to wear mechanisms and the factors influencing it: factors that affect the abrasion resistance of concrete and several test methods for assessing it; and the historical development of fibres and the properties of different fibre types and their influence on concrete. Three accelerated abrasion testers were compared and critically discussed for their suitability for assessing the abrasion resistance of concrete floors. Based on the experimental findings one accelerated abrasion apparatus was selected as more appropriate to be used for carrying out the main investigations. The laboratory programme that followed was undertaken to investigate the influence of various material and construction factors on abrasion resistance. These included mix variations (w/c ratio), fibre reinforcement, geometry, type and volume, curing method and superplasticizing agents. The results clearly show that these factors significantly affected abrasion resistance and several mechanisms were presumed to explain and better understand these observations. To verify and understand these mechanisms that are accountable for the breakdown of concrete slabs, the same concrete specimens that were used for the macro-study, were also subjected to microstructutural investigations using techniques such as Microhardness examination, Mercury intrusion porosimetry and Petrographic examination. It has been found that the abrasion resistance of concrete is primarily dependent on the microstructure and porosity of the concrete nearest to the surface. The feasibility of predicting the abrasion resistance of fibre reinforced concrete floors by indirect and non-destructive methods was investigated using five methods that have frequently been used for assessing the quality of concrete. They included the initial surface absorption test, the impact test, <b>ball</b> <b>cratering,</b> the scratch test and the base hardness test. The impact resistance (BRE screed tester) and scratch resistance (Base hardness tester) were found to be the most sensitive to factors affecting abrasion resistance and hence are considered to be the most appropriate testing techniques.
