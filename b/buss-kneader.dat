40|$|The <b>Buss-Kneader</b> is {{generally}} {{known as a}} compounding device. Although a reasonable number of papers have been published on extruders as polymerization reactors, only {{little is known about}} the behavior of the <b>Buss-Kneader</b> when used as a polymerization reactor. Its good mixing properties in the radial and axial directions make it a suitable reactor for exothermal polymerization reactions. This paper describes experiments with the co-polymerization of n-butyl acrylate and hydroxyethyl methacrylate in a <b>Buss-Kneader.</b> For model calculations the <b>Buss-Kneader</b> was treated as a plug flow reactor with axial dispersion. Experimental results on axial temperature profile, monomer conversion and molecular weght are compared with model calculations. Model parameters are based on independently measured data on the heat transfer coefficient, axial dispersion and polymerization kinetics. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The radical {{addition}} co-polymerisation f 2 -hydroxyethylmethacrylate and butylacrylate {{is carried}} out in a continuously operating <b>Buss-Kneader.</b> To calculate temperature profiles over {{the length of the}} kneader the heal balance is solved. For the heat transfer coefficient a model based on the penetration theory, is used. This model is experimentally verified. The reaction kinetics of the radical addition polymerisation are studied in a differential scanning calorimeter. The polymerisation kinetics are modeled using non-stationary adical concentrations. The calculated temperature profiles over the length of the <b>Buss-Kneader</b> are a good approximation of the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Buss-Kneader</b> {{has proven}} to be a {{suitable}} reactor for the polymerization of acrylates. In this second part, the polymerization of methyl methacrylate and the ter-polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA), hydroxyethyl methacrylate and n-butylmethacrylate is carried out in a pilot <b>Buss-Kneader.</b> The reactor had to be pressurized up to about 10 bars to avoid evaporation of MMA. Instabilities in output rate and temperature profiles were observed as a result of fluctuating die pressures. Because of good mixing there may be no diffusion limitation for radicals. As a result, even at high conversions, no gel effect was observed. ...|$|E
