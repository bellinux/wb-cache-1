We didn't {{experience}} the headlong panic that is sometimes prevalent while finishing a game, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> did experience considerable stress as we built 21 final candidates in 3 days. After a few long nights with the whole team playing the game over and over again, we reached a point where we built a good final candidate. Then it was sent to the duplicators! ...|$|E
2500|$|All in Good Time was {{generally}} well {{received by the}} critics. The band toured the United States and Canada {{during the summer of}} 2010, with a leg in the United Kingdom in the fall. When asked about Page's departure, Tyler Stewart said [...] "We don't keep in touch, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> we [...] wish him the best and there's good will there." [...] In October 2010, Page stated that {{he has no plans to}} rejoin the band in the near future, other than a possible one-off performance. He added that it felt strange the band continued to use the same name and perform the songs that he wrote and performed.|$|E
2500|$|Kant thinks that, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the good will, all goods are qualified. By qualified, Kant means that those goods are good insofar as they presuppose or derive their goodness from something else. Take wealth as an example. Wealth can be extremely good if it is used for human welfare, but it can be disastrous if a corrupt mind is behind it. In a similar vein, we often desire intelligence and take it to be good, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> would not take the intelligence of an evil genius to be good. The good will, by contrast, is good in itself. [...] Kant writes, “A good will is not good because of what it effects or accomplishes, because of its fitness to attain some proposed end, but only because its volition, that is, it is good initself [...] [...] [...] [...]” (4:394) The precise nature of the good will is subject to scholarly debate.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1972 MacCallum {{provided}} lead vocals for [...] "It's Time", {{which was}} written and produced by Pat Aulton. The concept and words were by Paul Jones the Creative Director of the campaign. It {{was used as the}} theme on Australian Labor Party's TV and radio ads during Gough Whitlam's 1972 federal election campaign, making MacCallum a famous name through saturation radio and TV airplay, despite the single failing to chart. According to James Cockington [...] "even though Labor was not credited on the label nor mentioned in the lyrics, most radio stations were reluctant to play the song, sensing its party-political roots". MacCallum was joined in the TV ads with a variety of celebrities including Bert Newton, Col Joye, Judy Stone, John Dease, Hazel Phillips, Ted Hamilton, Bellbird cast members, and Bobby Limb. Some of the celebrities suffered a negative backlash from appearing in the ads, Stone recalled [...] "we didn't get paid for it, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> lost a lot of work over it ... Some of us were black banned from clubs, and I had garbage thrown all over my lawn. And I wasn't the only one singled out".|$|E

60|$|This {{then was}} the Canyon of the Rainbow Bridge. When we got down into it {{we were a}} happy crowd. The mode of travel here was a {{selection}} of the best levels, {{the best places to}} cross the brook, the best places to climb, and it was a process of continual repetition. There was no trail ahead of us, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> left one behind. And as Wetherill picked out the course and the mustangs followed him I had all freedom to see and feel the beauty, color, wildness and changing character of Nonnezoshe Boco.|$|E

At any rate, if she should get there first, we should certainly lie between her and Cuba, and she will have either to run back, or to round the cape, or to run east or south. I wish the wind would freshen; but I fancy that it is more likely to die away. Still, she is walking along well at present." ...|$|E

'Besides, think how glorious it will be if we DO manage to kill him! I know what sort of weapon I shall use. Come with me now, and I will see about it.' And, taking his friend by the arm, he led him into a shop where he bought a huge lump of solid iron, so big that they could hardly lift it between them. However, they just managed to carry it to a blacksmith's where Rosald directed {{that it should be}} beaten into a thick club, with a sharp spike at one end. When this was done to his liking he took it home under his arm.|$|E
6000|$|That Mr. Ridgeway adopts Helbig's theory--the poet says [...] "bronze," [...] by a {{survival}} of the diction of the bronze age, when he means iron--I infer from the following passage: [...] "Chalkos is the name for the older metal, of which cutting weapons were made, and it thus lingered in many phrases of the Epic dialect; 'to smite with the chalkos' was equivalent to our phrase 'to smite with the steel.'" [...] [Footnote: Early Age of Greece, i. 295.] <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> do smite with the steel, while the question is, [...] "DID Homer's men smite with the iron?" [...] Homer says not; he does not merely use [...] "an epic phrase" [...] "to smite with the CHALKOS," [...] but he carefully describes swords, spears, and usually arrow-heads as being of bronze (CHALKOS), while axes, adzes, and knives are frequently described by him as of iron.|$|E
60|$|Then, for {{the first}} time, I told him that I was in a but very little better position; and I am bound to say that, {{notwithstanding}} his own infatuation, he had the decency to sympathise with me. Perhaps {{he did not think}} it worth while being jealous, realising that he had no cause so far as the lady was concerned. I went on to suggest that we should try to run away, but we soon rejected the project as futile, and, to be perfectly honest, I do not believe that either of us would really have left Ayesha even if some superior power had suddenly offered to convey us from these gloomy caves and set us down in Cambridge. We could no more have left her than a moth can leave the light that destroys it. We were like confirmed opium-eaters: in our moments of reason we well knew the deadly nature of our pursuit, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> were not prepared to abandon its terrible delights.|$|E

60|$|To my apprehension, a {{volition}} {{is not an}} efficient, {{but simply}} a physical cause. Our will causes our bodily actions in the same sense, and in no other, in which cold causes ice, or a spark causes an explosion of gunpowder. The volition, a state of our mind, is the antecedent; the motion of our limbs in conformity to the volition, is the consequent. This sequence I conceive to be not a subject of direct consciousness, in the sense intended by the theory. The antecedent, indeed, and the consequent, are subjects of consciousness. But the connection between them is a subject of experience. I can not admit that our consciousness of the volition contains in itself any a priori knowledge that the muscular motion will follow. If our nerves of motion were paralyzed, or our muscles stiff and inflexible, and had been so all our lives, I {{do not see the}} slightest ground for supposing that we should ever (unless by information from other people) have known any thing of volition as a physical power, or been conscious of any tendency in feelings of our mind to produce motions of our body, or of other bodies. I will not undertake to say whether we should in that case have had the physical feeling which I suppose is meant when these writers speak of “consciousness of effort:” I see no reason why we should not; since that physical feeling is probably a state of nervous sensation beginning and ending in the brain, without involving the motory apparatus: <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> should not have designated it by any term equivalent to effort, since effort implies consciously aiming at an end, which we should not only in that case have had no reason to do, but could not even have had the idea of doing. If conscious at all of this peculiar sensation, we should have been conscious of it, I conceive, only as a kind of uneasiness, accompanying our feelings of desire.|$|E
60|$|It will be said, perhaps, {{that many}} discoveries {{have already taken}} place in the world that were totally {{unforeseen}} and unexpected. This I grant to be true; but if a person had predicted these discoveries without being guided by any analogies or indications from past facts, he would deserve the name of seer or prophet, but not of philosopher. The wonder that some of our modern discoveries would excite in the savage inhabitants of Europe in the times of Theseus and Achilles, proves but little. Persons almost entirely unacquainted with the powers of a machine cannot be expected to guess at its effects. I am far from saying, that we are at present by any means fully acquainted with the powers of the human mind; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> know more of this instrument than was known four thousand years ago; and therefore, though not to be called competent judges, we are certainly much better able than savages to say what is, or is not, within its grasp. A watch would strike a savage with as much surprise as a perpetual motion; yet one is to us a most familiar piece of mechanism, and the other has constantly eluded the efforts of the most acute intellects. In many instances we are now able to perceive the causes, which prevent an unlimited improvement in those inventions, which seemed to promise fairly for it at first. The original improvers of telescopes would probably think, {{that as long as the}} size of the specula and the length of the tubes could be increased, the powers and advantages of the instrument would increase; but experience has since taught us, that the smallness of the field, the deficiency of light, and the circumstance of the atmosphere being magnified, prevent the beneficial results that were to be expected from telescopes of extraordinary size and power. In many parts of knowledge, man has been almost constantly making some progress; in other parts, his efforts have been invariably baffled. The savage would not probably be able to guess at the causes of this mighty difference. Our further experience has given us some little insight into these causes, and has therefore enabled us better to judge, if not of what we are to expect in future, at least of what we are not to expect, which, though negative, is a very useful piece of information.|$|E
