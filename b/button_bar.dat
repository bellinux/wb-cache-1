50|$|The {{changes to}} the dock bring its {{functionality}} also close to that of Apple's Newton OS <b>Button</b> <b>Bar,</b> as found in the MessagePad 2x00 series and the likes. Applications could be dragged {{in and out of}} the Extras Drawer, a Finder-like app, onto the bar. Also, when the screen was put into landscape mode, the user could choose to position the <b>Button</b> <b>Bar</b> at the right or left side of the screen, just like the Dock in macOS.|$|E

50|$|Essentially, Series 90 is a {{development}} of the Psion Eikon GUI as used on the Series 5, Series 5mx, Revo, netPad, Series 7 and netBook machines. It has been modified to be controlled entirely through the touchscreen, supplemented by the 77x0's seven hardware buttons and rocker-dial. The Nokia 7700, which was never released, had only an on-screen keyboard for text input; the 7710 added basic handwriting recognition. Applications now have only a single menu tree, accessible from the title bar {{at the top of}} the screen; there is no Exit or Quit option in most apps; and a <b>button</b> <b>bar</b> has been added to the right hand side of the screen, resembling that of the Nokia Communicator smartphones.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{various issues}} related to the screen orientation and the <b>Button</b> <b>Bar</b> in the most recent line of Newton devices. For example, on the MessagePad 2000 the <b>Button</b> <b>Bar</b> is drawn on the LCD screen. Therefore, it is possible to obscure it, reconfigure it, change its appearance, or entirely replace it. This article describes how to do things that will put the Newton in a non-standard configuration that users may find confusing. Normal, well-written applications should have no need to do this. This information is intended for applications with special needs and should be thought of more as techniques for customizing a particular Newton device rather than general purpose APIs. Do not give in to the temptation to add frivolous features to your applications. Every application does not need a preference checkbox to put its icon on the <b>Button</b> <b>Bar.</b> Furthermore, most of the information presented here is not officially supported and is not guaranteed to work on future Newton Devices. Applications that use it run the risk of incompatibility with future systems. Of course, efforts will be made to maintain compatibility, but changes in design may make compatibility impossible. For example, the <b>Button</b> <b>Bar</b> could be radically redesigned making many of the options no longer applicable. Despite this caveat, I'm sure there are still developers anxious to use this information. By following the suggestions in this article you will maximize your application's chances for compatibility with future Newton devices. THE FUTURE OF NEWTON Given the uncertainty around Apple recently, the understandable question on everyone's mind has been, "What is the future of Newton?" I want to take some time now to reassure our developers and customers that the Newton platform is strong and movin [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} a study of how knowledge workers use the Web to seek external information {{as part of their}} daily work. Thirty-four users from seven companies took part in the study. Participants were mainly IT specialists, managers, and research/marketing/consulting staff working in organizations that included a large utility company, a major bank, and a consulting firm. Participants answered a detailed questionnaire and were interviewed individually in order to understand their information needs and information seeking preferences. A custom-developed WebTracker software application was installed on each of their workplace PCs, and participants'Web-use activities were then recorded continuously during two-week periods. The WebTracker recorded how participants used the browser to seek information on the Web: it logged menu choices, <b>button</b> <b>bar</b> selections, and keystroke actions, allowing browsing and searching sequences to be reconstructed. In a second round of personal interviews, participants recalled critical incidents of using information from the Web. Data from the two interviews and the WebTracker logs constituted the database for analysis. Sixty-one significant episodes of information seeking were identified. A model wa...|$|E

40|$|The {{project was}} {{concerned}} {{with the development of}} a set of computer based presentations giving the bakground, relevant theory and operating instructions for laboratory exercises in Fluid Mechanics in the School of Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering, (now Aeronautical, Civil and Mechanical Engineering). A number of presentations were generated, (with embedded sound), each tailored to a particular experiment undertaken by level 0, 1 and 2 students in Fluid Mechanics. The intention was to enable students {{to be able to work}} at their own pace and to maximise their use of laboratory time. Using the materials prepared each group of students was able to start at the same time rather then in the conventional laboratory session where some groups have to wait until the lecturer can explain to them what to do. In the initial pilot the package used for the presentation material was ASTOUND 5. Though the pilot was broadly successful a number of problems were encountered which restricted the usefulness of the materials. In particular difficulty with achieving good sound quality was experienced and also difficulties with ensuring that the equations involved in the theory were compatible with the presentation text were found. Also after much work had been completed in ASTOUND a run-time error which occasionally caused presentations to halt and the package to lock-up was experienced. The cause of this error was never fully discovered. In the pilot material provision was made to enable students to loop backwards and forwards, using button bars within the presentations so that they could re-play particularly complex slides if they wished. Experience showed that students found this facility confusing and in subsequent developments this feature was removed. For the current academic year the material has been converted into Powerpoint and the <b>button</b> <b>bar</b> feature has been removed so that the presentations run straight through. It is however possible for students to halt the presentations at any stage whilst they clarify any points of uncertainty and then re-start when they are ready. The acquisition of Sound Forge has enabled the sound quality to be improved and the acquisition of Mathtype (the full equation editor) has enabled the difficulty encountered with the equations to be resolved easily. Conclusions Whilst preparation of the material has been time consuming and a steep IT learning curve was necessary the end results are considered to be of significant benefit to students studying Fluid Mechanics. Students do appreciate that they have the opportunity to replay the presentations and some return in their own time to do so. Students who for legitimate reasons miss a laboratory session have the opportunity to recover this easily. A greater degree of ‘quality control’ can be exercised since each student experiences the same introduction. Future Developments Whilst sound quality has been improved the embedded sound files are large so that an entire presentation may take up some 40 MB of disk space which sometimes be a problem. Newer versions of Powerpoint (Powerpoint 2001) will play. MP 3 files which typically take up only about 10...|$|E
