25|$|The subject {{upon which}} you have written to me {{is one in which}} I {{naturally}} take a more than common interest. Not only was I one of the Oxford Crew in the first Inter-University Boat-Race in 1829, but the Race was entirely set up by me, owing to the fact that though I was myself at Christ Church, Oxford, my home was at Cambridge (my father being Master of Trinity), and I had a large acquaintance there, and some-times (especially in Easter vacations) was invited to pull in one of their boats, e. g. that of St John's, in which were the now Bishops, Selwyn and Tyrrell, and Charles Merivale the historian, all now vigorous and flourishing. I may also mention, as bearing upon your enquiry, that as soon as my father heard that I had been chosen one of the Oxford Eight, and was practising for the Race, he wrote me an earnest letter, in which he desired me not to row any more, simply from anxiety lest my health should suffer. Though I was always much given to athletic exercises, even <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Harrow (where I was one of the Eleven in the first Matches against Eton, for four years, 1822 – 1825), my constitution was in some respects rather a delicate one. When I received his letter I went at once to my physician, told him the difficulty in which I was placed, begged him to examine my state of health, and got his authority to assure my father that so far as he could judge, rowing had not done me any harm. By this my father was satisfied, and I was allowed to go on. The Race itself, which was at Henley (two miles up stream), certainly did me no harm, though at the time I was incommoded by the change to an unusual diet, — under-done beefsteaks, porter, dry bread, no butter, no tea, no vegetables. After the Race, which was on Wednesday or Tuesday (I think), I was able to play cricket, as one of the Eleven also, against Cambridge on the following Friday. The match was at Oxford. We were victorious on both occasions.|$|E
500|$|Several {{of those}} {{affected}} {{by the events of}} the Antinomian Controversy went north with John Wheelwright in November 1637 to found the town of Exeter in what became New Hampshire. [...] A larger group of men were uncertain where to go, so they contacted Roger Williams who suggested that they purchase land from the Narragansett people along the Narragansett Bay, near his settlement of Providence Plantations. [...] John Clarke apparently did both, based on what he wrote in his book: [...] "By reason of the suffocating heat of the summer <b>before</b> , <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the North to be somewhat cooler, but the winter following [...] proved so cold, that we were forced in the spring to make towards the South." ...|$|E
500|$|Hemingway greatly admired Cézanne {{and early}} in his career crafted his prose {{in a way that would}} {{resonate}} with that painter's work. He said in a 1949 interview that [...] "Cézanne is my painter after the early painters.... I can make a landscape like Mr. Paul Cézanne, I learned how... by walking through the Luxembourg Museum a thousand times." [...] Hemingway wanted the structure of [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] to resemble a Cézanne—with a detailed foreground set against a vaguely described background. In a letter to Stein from August 1924, he wrote, [...] "I have finished two long stories... and finished the long one I worked on <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Spain where I am doing the country like Cézanne and having a hell of a time and sometimes getting it a little bit. It is about 100 pages long and nothing happens and the country is swell. I made it all up".|$|E

2500|$|Various {{artists have}} cited Ege Bamyası as an influence. Stephen Malkmus of Pavement has been {{quoted as saying}} [...] "I played Can's Ege Bamyası album every night <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> sleep for about three years." [...] Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth recalls, [...] "I found Ege Bamyası in the 49-cent bin at Woolworth's. I didn't see {{anything}} written about Can, I didn't know anything about them except this okra can on the cover, which seemed completely bizarre. I finally picked that record up, and I completely wore it out. It was so alluring. Something about it made Can seem to be playing outside of rock 'n' roll. It was unlike anything else I was hearing at the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scarry {{borrowed}} Paul Brown's coaching techniques at Western Reserve, instituting well-organized practices there. [...] "I {{had a lot}} {{of ideas}} about coaching <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> work for the Browns," [...] he said in 1947. [...] "But the manner in which Paul organized his practice and all his duties impressed me. I try to do the same here." [...] With no good passer or runner and a lack of depth, Reserve's Red Cats performed poorly in Scarry's first season, but he was praised for making the most out of a thin squad. In his second year in 1949, the Red Cats improved to a 4–5–1 record, and Scarry was expected to stay on for a third season. The following year, however, he resigned to take an assistant coaching position at Santa Clara University in California under former Browns assistant Dick Gallagher.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{weeks after}} the release of her debut album, Enya secured a {{recording}} contract with Warner Music UK after Rob Dickins, the label's chairman and a fan of Clannad, took a liking to Enya and found himself playing it [...] "every night <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed". He then met Enya and the Ryans at a chance meeting at the Irish Recorded Music Association award ceremony in Dublin, and learned Enya was thinking about signing with a rival label. Dickins seized the opportunity and signed her to Warner Music with a deal worth £75,000, granting her wish to write and record with artistic freedom, minimal interference from the label, and without set deadlines to finish albums. Dickins said: [...] "Sometimes you sign an act to make money, and sometimes you sign an act to make music. This was clearly the latter ... I just wanted to be involved with this music." [...] Enya then left Atlantic and signed with the Warner-led Geffen Records to handle her American distribution.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1987, the 26-year-old Enya {{released}} her self-titled debut solo album Enya on BBC Records in the United Kingdom and by Atlantic Records in the United States. It was originally produced as the soundtrack to the BBC2 documentary series The Celts, with Enya and her recording partners of five years, manager, arranger and producer Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan. It was a mild commercial success, peaking at number 69 in the United Kingdom. Soon after its release Rob Dickins, then chairman of Warner Music UK, became {{a fan of}} the album, playing it [...] "every night <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed". Several weeks later, he met Enya and the Ryans at a chance meeting at the year's Irish Recorded Music Association Awards in Dublin where Dickens learned Enya was considering to sign to a rival label, prompting him to attract her to Warner. After a period of negotiations, Dickins signed Enya with a deal worth £75,000, granting her wishes to complete musical and artistic freedom, without interference from management or deadlines to have albums finished. Dickins later said, [...] "Sometimes you sign an act to make money, and sometimes you sign an act to make music. This was clearly the latter ... I just wanted to be involved with this music." [...] In the process, Enya departed from Atlantic and signed to the Warner-led Geffen Records to handle distribution in North America.|$|E
