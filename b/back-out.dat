40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{safety profile}} of open door laminoplasty plates. Overview of Literature: Few reports have documented potential complications {{related to the}} use of cervical laminoplasty plates. Methods: Records and radiographs of consecutive plated laminoplasty patients of one academic surgeon were analyzed. Group 1 had screw <b>back-out,</b> defined as change in screw position, and group 2 did not. Results: Forty-two patients (mean age, 56. 9) underwent “open-door ” cervical laminoplasty using 165 plates. Mean follow-up was 24 months (range, 12 – 49 months). Mean Nurick grade improved from 2. 1 to 0. 9 postoperatively. Cervical lordosis (C 2 – 7) was 12. 1 ° preoperatively and 10. 0 ° postoperatively. Range-of-motion was 27. 0 ° preoperatively and 23. 4 ° postoperatively. Partial screw <b>back-out</b> was noted in 27 of 165 plates (16. 4 %) and in 34 of 660 screws (5. 2 %). Of the 34 screws, 27 (79. 4 %) were at either the most cranial (12 / 27, 44. 4 %) or the most caudal (15 / 27, 55. 5 %) level. Cranially, 11 / 12 screws (91. 7 %) had <b>back-out.</b> Caudally, 9 / 15 lateral mass screws (60. 0 %) backed-out versus 6 laminar screws (40. 0 %). Of the 22 patients with screw <b>back-out,</b> 15 (68. 2 %) occurred < 3 months postoperative and 6 (27. 3 %) occurred 4 – 12 months postoperative. No statistical differences were found between group 1 and 2 for age, gender, preoperative and postoperative lordosis, focal sagittal alignment, range-of-motion, or Nurick grade. Despite screw <b>back-out</b> in 22 patients, there were no plate dislodgements, laminoplasty closure, or neurological deterioration.

30|$|Our overall {{reoperation}} rate of 15.8  % compares {{well with}} that reported for locked plating. Sproul and colleagues reported a reoperation rate of 13.8  %, mostly for screw penetration [34]. Most of the reoperations {{in our study}} were related to proximal screw migration. Proximal screw migration may be decreased {{through the use of}} an end-cap as well as threaded bushings within the nail to minimize screw <b>back-out</b> [7, 29]. The nail should be inserted at least 5  mm below the subchondral bone of the humeral head and proximal screw lengths fluoroscopically verified [8, 18]. A more medial articular entry point may cause less damage to the rotator cuff as the more medial aspect of rotator cuff has more vascularity [7, 8, 18], though rotator cuff symptoms can persist despite meticulous repair [8]. The reoperation rate for two-part and three-part fractures in our study was 13.6 and 17.4  %, respectively. As these result primarily from screw <b>back-out</b> and fracture displacement, meticulous surgical technique and newer implant designs may reduce their incidence. Given the high reoperation rate amongst four-part fractures (63.2  %), caution should be exercised in selecting IMN for this fracture pattern and preoperative discussions should be held with the patient regarding this risk.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Pedicle screws with PMMA cement {{augmentation}} {{have been}} shown to significantly improve the fixation strength in a severely osteoporotic spine. However, the efficacy of screw fixation for different cement augmentation techniques, namely solid screws with retrograde cement pre-filling versus cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation, remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the difference in pullout strength between conical and cylindrical screws based on the aforementioned cement augmentation techniques. The potential loss of fixation upon partial screw removal after screw insertion was also examined. Method The Taguchi method with an L 8 array was employed to determine the significance of design factors. Conical and cylindrical pedicle screws with solid or cannulated designs were installed using two different screw augmentation techniques: solid screws with retrograde cement pre-filling and cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation. Uniform synthetic bones (test block) simulating severe osteoporosis were used to provide a platform for each screw design and cement augmentation technique. Pedicle screws at full insertion and after a 360 -degree <b>back-out</b> from full insertion were then tested for axial pullout failure using a mechanical testing machine. Results The results revealed the following 1) Regardless of the screw outer geometry (conical or cylindrical), solid screws with retrograde cement pre-filling exhibited significantly higher pullout strength than did cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation (p = 0. 0129 for conical screws; p = 0. 005 for cylindrical screws). 2) For a given cement augmentation technique (screws without cement augmentation, cannulated screws with cement injection or solid screws with cement pre-filling), no significant difference in pullout strength was found between conical and cylindrical screws (p > 0. 05). 3) Cement infiltration into the open cell of the test block {{led to the formation of}} a cement/bone composite structure. Observations of the failed specimens indicated that failure occurred at the composite/bone interface, whereas the composite remained well bonded to the screws. This result implies that the screw/composite interfacial strength was much higher than the composite/bone interfacial strength. 4) The <b>back-out</b> of the screw by 360 degrees from full insertion did not decrease the pullout strength in any of the studied cases. 5) Generally, larger standard deviations were found for the screw <b>back-out</b> cases, implying that the results of full insertion cases are more repeatable than those of the <b>back-out</b> cases. Conclusions Solid screws with retrograde cement pre-filling offer improved initial fixation strength when compared to that of cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation for both the conically and cylindrically shaped screw. Our results also suggest that the fixation screws can be backed out by 360 degrees for intra-operative adjustment without the loss of fixation strength. </p...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{effect of}} implant removal after {{internal}} fixation of a femoral neck fracture on physical functioning was analyzed. Characteristics {{of patients who}} had their implant removed were studied, as it is currently unknown from which type of patients implants are removed and what effect removal has on function. DESIGN: Secondary cohort study alongside a randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Multicenter study in 14 hospitals. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: Patients who had their implant removed after internal fixation of a femoral neck fracture are compared with patients who did not. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Patient characteristics {{and quality of life}} (Short Form 12, Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index) were compared. Matched pairs were selected based on patient/fracture characteristics and prefracture physical functioning. RESULTS: Of 162 patients, 37 (23 %) had their implant removed. These patients were younger (median age: 67 vs. 72 years, P = 0. 024) and more often independently ambulatory prefracture (100 % vs. 84 %, P = 0. 008) than patients who did not. They more often had evident implant <b>back-out</b> on x-rays (54 % vs. 34 %, P = 0. 035), possibly related to a higher rate of Pauwels 3 fractures (41 % vs. 22 %, P = 0. 032). In time, quality of life improved more in implant removal patients [+ 2 vs. - 4 points, Short Form 12 (physical component), P = 0. 024; + 9 vs. 0 points, Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index, P = 0. 019]. CONCLUSIONS: Implant removal after internal fixation of a femoral neck fracture positively influenced quality of life. Implant removal patients were younger and more often independently ambulatory prefracture, more often had a Pauwels 3 fracture, and an evident implant <b>back-out.</b> Implant removal should be considered liberally for these patients if pain persists or functional recovery is unsatisfactory.

30|$|We {{recommend}} prior fixation of the femoral {{shaft fracture}} in these injuries, without attempting {{to reduce the}} femoral neck fracture initially, as it provides for more easy subsequent manipulation, reduction, and fixation of the ipsilateral femoral neck fracture. In both of our cases, we fixed the femoral shaft fracture with a plate and screw, and followed this with closed reduction and internal fixation of the femoral neck fracture. However, in one case (case 1), reduction of the subtrochanteric fracture was lost due to proximal screw <b>back-out</b> resulting from inadequate fixation of the proximal fragment, which in turn led to a 10 ° varus deformity of the proximal femur. In this case, we should have considered {{the distance between the}} two fractures to be a prognostic factor, and the possibility of using a low-profile plate that can be modeled in the proximal part to allow introduction of a screw through the proximal hole of the plate into the femoral neck if the two fractures are too close together. We do not need absolutely stable osteosynthesis, because in children younger than ten years it is always advisable to create a spica cast.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} has been {{estimated}} the compressive strength of a unidirectional lamina of a carbon/epoxy composite material, using the cross-ply and angle-ply laminates. Over the years various methods {{have been developed to}} deduce compressive properties of composite materials reinforced with long fibres. Each of these methods is characterized by a specific way of applying load to the specimen. The method chosen to perform the compression tests is the Wyoming Combined Loading Compression (CLC) Test Method, described in ASTM D 6641 / D 6641 M- 09. This method presents many advantages, especially: the load application on the specimen (end load combined with shear load), the reproducibility of measurements and the experimental equipment quite simplified. Six different laminates were tested in compressive tests.

The focus {{of this research is}} to design and optimize the radome 2 ̆ 7 s constituent material parameters for maximizing the isolation between an interior receiver antenna and an exterior transmitter without significantly disturbing the transmitter antenna far field characteristics. The design, characterization, and optimization of high-temperature superconducting metamaterials constitutive parameters are developed in this work at X-band frequencies. A calibrated characterization method for testing arrays of split-ring resonators at cryogenic temperature inside a TE 10 waveguide was developed and used to <b>back-out</b> anisotropic equivalent material parameters. The artificial material elements (YBCO split-ring resonators on MgO substrate) are optimized to improve the narrowband performance of the metamaterial radome with respect to maximizing isolation and minimizing shadowing, defined as a reduction of the transmitted power external to the radome. The optimized radome is fabricated and characterized in a parallel plate waveguide in a cryogenic environment to demonstrate the degree of isolation and shadowing resulting from its presence. At 11. 12 GHz, measurements show that the HTS metamaterial radome achieved an isolation of 10. 5 dB and the external power at 100 mm behind the radome is reduced by 1. 9 dB.

40|$|Due to {{rotating}} inertias {{within the}} engine and transmission, the response of a vehicle during large and/or fast engine speed shifts may appear reluctant or even counteractive. Reminiscent of comparable behaviour seen in aircraft jet-propulsion, this phenomenon is {{also referred to as}} ‘jet-start’. To overcome this behaviour, a CVT powertrain is augmented with a powersplitting planetary gear stage and compact steel flywheel. The new transmission—coded ‘Zero Inertia (ZI) powertrain’— seamlessly combines two contradictive features: the driveability in terms of the pedal-to-wheel response is greatly improved and a large leap towards optimal fuel economy can be made. This is achieved by cruising the vehicle at extremely low engine speeds as of the large ratio-coverage of the CVT. The flywheel acts as a ‘peak shaver’ during engine speed shifts: it delivers power during (semi-) pedal kick down and absorbs kinetic energy of the engine at pedal <b>back-out.</b> This paper presents results from simulations of, and field experiments with a test vehicle incorporating the ZI powertrain. The evaluation concentrates especially on longitudinal driveability and is compared with that of basic CVT and 4 -gear automatic powertrains. Results on the substantially improved fuel economy are summarized {{at the end of the}} paper. The driveability has an accurately controllable character, i. e., the accuracy with which desired drive shaft torque excursions can be realized by the powertrain. The subjective driveability depends highly on how drive pedal deflections are translated into desired drive shaft torque excursions. Evaluation by experts and non-experts in general determines the quality of this translation. A non-rigorous attempt to formalize the translation and use it in a powertrain control strategy is made. Preliminary conclusions on possible acceptance by public are drawn. From this, directions for ongoing research are given...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{rotating}} inertias {{within the}} engine and transmission, the response of a vehicle during large engine speed shifts may appear reluctant or even counteractive. To overcome this behaviour, a CVT drivetrain was augmented with a powersplitting planetary gear stage and steel flywheel in the so-called Zero Inertia (ZI) powertrain [1]. This transmission concept managed to combine two contradictive goals: · the driveability {{in terms of the}} pedal-to-wheel response is greatly improved; · and a large leap towards optimal fuel economy can be made. These goals were achieved by cruising the vehicle at extremely low engine speeds, enabled by the large ratiocoverage of the CVT. The flywheel acts as a 'peakshaver' during engine speed transients: it delivers power during (semi-) pedal kickdown and absorbs the engine's kinetic energy at pedal <b>back-out.</b> The current paper presents an improved concept with respect to the Zero Inertia drivetrain, which enables a reduced flywheel size while enhancing the pedal-towheel response even further. This concept is designated the Impulse Shift CVT (IS-CVT). The IS-CVT incorporates a slightly modified drive clutch and uses it to interrupt the power flow through the CVT during kickdown accelerations. Disengaging the drive clutch directs the entire engine power flow through the parallel (flywheel and planetary gear) branch, resulting in an immediate flywheel assist while the engine speeds up rapidly. When the engine has reached its desired speed, the drive clutch is re-engaged and the power flow through the CVT is reinstated. The presented IS-CVT concept enables much faster speed transients, independent of the CVT shift rate, resulting in a more effective use of the flywheel energy. Hence the flywheel can be reduced, and the ZI effect can be exploited to the fullest. Furthermore, the demands on the variator actuators can be lower. Simulations of the performance of the IS-CVT are presented and compared to those of CVT and ZI equipped vehicles...|$|E

The percutaneous compression plate (PCCP) is a minimally invasive device that has been demonstrated in previous studies to reduce postoperative complications and blood loss. This prospective, multi-center, observational study assessed clinical and functional outcomes with PCCP as treatment for trochanteric fractures. Patients with a stable or unstable proximal femoral fracture of type AO 31. A 1 or 31. A 2 were enrolled in eight hospitals in Italy. The primary outcome of interest was the recovery of the pre-fracture functional status at 1 -year follow-up; secondary outcomes of interest included blood transfusions, surgical time, complications, and mortality. A total of 273 patients were enrolled. The ASA score was 3 or 4 in 72. 5 % of patients. The mean surgical time was 44. 1 min; the mean post-surgery blood transfusions was 0. 9 units. At 1 year, 48 patients (17. 6 %) died, 28 (10. 2 %) were lost to follow-up, 4 patients (1. 5 %) were excluded, hence 193 patients (70. 3 %) were available for final evaluation. At the 1 -year follow-up visit, 51. 9 % of patients recovered or improved their pre-fracture modified Harris Hip Score, 49. 1 % of patients improved or maintained their walking abilities, and 66. 6 % of patients residing at home pre-surgery maintained their domicile. The overall mortality rate was 17. 6 %. Major complications included two fracture collapses, one excessive sliding of the cephalic screw leading to a partial fracture collapse and one <b>back-out</b> of the diaphyseal screw.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe best {{surgical}} {{strategy for}} extra-capsular proximal femoral fractures (PFFs) is controversial in the elderly. Poor bone quality and neck screw instability can adversely affect the results with currently available fixation devices, which predominantly consist in dynamic hip screw-plates and proximal reconstruction nails. HypothesisThe helical blade of the proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFN-A™) achieves better cancellous bone compaction in the femoral neck, thereby decreasing {{the risk of}} secondary displacement. Materials and MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed consecutive cases of PFN-A™ fixation performed between 2006 and 2008 in 102 patients (75 females and 27 males) {{with a mean age}} of 84. 9 ± 9. 5 years (range, 70 – 100 years). Functional outcomes were assessed using the Parker Mobility Score. ResultsMean follow-up in the 102 patients was 21. 3 ± 17. 5 months (4 – 51 months). Fracture distribution in the AO classification scheme was A 1, n= 45; A 2, n= 41; and A 3, n= 16. At last follow-up, Parker Mobility Score values in the 65 survivors were 0 – 3, n= 35; 4 – 6, n= 11; and 7 – 9, n= 19. Fracture union was consistently achieved, after a mean of 10. 3 ± 3 weeks. Blade <b>back-out</b> allowed by the device design occurred in 16 (15. 7 %) patients but caused pain due to screw impingement on the fascia lata in only five patients (of whom two underwent reoperation). Cephalic blade cut-out was noted in three (2. 9 %) patients, of whom one required reoperation because of acetabular penetration. Two hardware-related fractures were recorded. DiscussionThe new PFN-A™ device ensures reliable fixation with low mechanical complication rates. Although our data do not constitute proof that a helical blade is superior over a neck screw, they suggest a decreased rate of construct failure and may serve as a basis for a comparative study.

40|$|Background: Treatment {{options for}} {{nonunion}} of the femoral shaft fracture after intramedullary nail fixation are controversial. The methods of exchanging an existing nail with a larger-sized nail, dynamization, {{removal of the}} nail followed by plating, and bone grafting have all been reported. From those options, exchange nailing {{seems to be the}} most popular choice. In our study, we used plate augmentation and bone grafting with retention of the nail. The purpose of our study was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} this method in treating femoral shaft nonunion after open reduction and internal fixation with intramedullary nail fixation. Methods: Between January 2003 and December 2009, 22 patients who had nonunion after open reduction and internal fixation with intramedullary nail for femoral shaft fracture were included in our study. There were 13 men and nine women participants, with a mean age of 34. 3 years (range, 17 – 77 years). The mean period of nonunion after surgery was 20. 0 months (range, 7 – 63 months). The patients were classified into three groups, atrophic, oligotrophic, and hypertrophic. We retained the nail and performed plate augmentation for all patients, with simultaneous autologous bone grafting as indicated. We followed up on all patients with plain film examination, and to assess functional recovery status to determine osseous union condition. Results: All 22 of the patients achieved postoperative bony union uneventfully at a mean time of 22. 1 weeks (range, 12 – 40 weeks). The mean operative time was 105 minutes (range, 60 – 150 minutes), and the mean blood loss was 340  ml (range, 150 – 700  ml). All of the patients could walk bearing full weight without pain within 3 months. There were no significant complications such as broken hardware, implant <b>back-out,</b> axial or rotational malalignment, or deep infections. Conclusion: Plate augmentation with retention of the nail with autologous bone grafting may be an effective and reliable alternative in treating nonunion of the femoral shaft fracture after open reduction and internal fixation with intramedullary nail...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2004 SAE International Due to {{rotating}} inertias {{within the}} engine and trans-mission, the response of a vehicle during large engine speed shifts may appear reluctant or even counteractive. To overcome this behaviour, a CVT drivetrain was augmented with a powersplitting planetary gear stage and steel flywheel in the so-called Zero Inertia (ZI) powertrain [1]. This transmission concept managed to combine two contradictive goals: • the driveability {{in terms of the}} pedal-to-wheel response is greatly improved; • and a large leap towards optimal fuel economy can be made. These goals were achieved by cruising the vehicle at extremely low engine speeds, enabled by the large ratio-coverage of the CVT. The flywheel acts as a 'peak-shaver ' during engine speed transients: it delivers power during (semi-) pedal kickdown and absorbs the engine's kinetic energy at pedal <b>back-out.</b> The current paper presents an improved concept with respect to the Zero Inertia drivetrain, which enables a reduced flywheel size while enhancing the pedal-to-wheel response even further. This concept is designated the Impulse Shift CVT (IS-CVT). The IS-CVT incorporates a slightly modified drive clutch and uses it to interrupt the power flow through the CVT during kickdown accelerations. Disengaging the drive clutch directs the entire engine power flow through the parallel (flywheel and planetary gear) branch, resulting in an immediate flywheel assist while the engine speeds up rapidly. When the engine has reached its desired speed, the drive clutch is re-engaged and the power flow through the CVT is reinstated. The presented IS-CVT concept enables much faster speed transients, independent of the CVT shift rate, resulting in a more effective use of the flywheel energy. Hence the flywheel can be reduced, and the ZI effect can be exploited to the fullest. Furthermore, the demands on the variator actuators can be lower. Simulations of the performance of the IS-CVT are presented and compared to those of CVT and ZI equipped vehicles...|$|E
