5|$|The missing depth is not {{the only}} factor that the critics deplore. An {{important}} feature of Michelangelo's work which, in many places, has disappeared forever is the painting of the eyeballs. Eyes appear in many instances to have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> buon fresco. Wherever they have not <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> buon fresco but added a secco, they have been removed by the restorers.|$|E
5|$|On January 25, five {{government}} witnesses testified, including Dr. Quidor and the Leetes' {{mother and}} sister. Quidor {{testified that he}} had discovered blood on a ball of twine, although it had <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> over with vermilion.|$|E
5|$|A {{counterpart}} to Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring. A painting called Smiling Girl {{hangs in the}} National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. (bequest Andrew W. Mellon) that could fit with Jacques’ description and has been recognized by the museum as a fake. It was attributed to Theo van Wijngaarden, friend and partner of van Meegeren, but may have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> by van Meegeren.|$|E
25|$|Two Class 31 diesels <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> {{in trial}} liveries. No.D5578 <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> in an unlined 'Light Electric blue', and No.D5579 <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> in a colour {{variously}} described as 'Bronze Gold' and 'Golden Ochre'.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} contains classrooms, art studios, {{faculty and}} administrative offices, an art gallery, computer labs, print and wood shops {{and a small}} 100 person theater. For most of its life it <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> brown, but in early 2005 the administrative offices <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> yellow, the college proper <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> green and the Old Little Theatre <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> red.|$|R
50|$|In the 1966-67 offseason, {{during the}} period in which Rice owned the stadium, the {{concrete}} exterior <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> white, and the interior <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> blue. The metal frieze circling the upper deck <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> white.|$|R
5|$|A painter whose {{creative}} output spanned {{nearly three}} decades, controversy erupted briefly in 1999, when disputed declarations {{were made by}} the artist regarding whether some works under his signature had <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> by some female relatives. Creator of the work Straightening spears at Ilyingaungau (1990), Tolson's paintings are held by several major Australian public galleries, including the Art Gallery of South Australia, National Gallery of Victoria and the National Museum of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{all sides}} of a stela were sculpted with human figures and hieroglyphic text, with each side forming {{a part of a}} single composition. Undecorated stelae in the form of plain slabs or columns of stone are found {{throughout}} the Maya region. These appear never to have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> or to have been decorated with overlaid stucco sculpture.|$|E
5|$|The Dening Hall has Daoist murals {{painted on}} {{three of its}} walls. The western wall's mural, said to have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> in the Tang Dynasty, {{measures}} 17 by 7 meters and features a local water deity with a winged being at the top. With similar dimensions to the western mural, the eastern mural portrays the Dragon King. The hall contains nine statues, all dating from a more recent period than the hall.|$|E
50|$|Most Polish RWD-13 <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> red, with {{a silver}} {{lightning}} painted on a fuselage and silver wings. RWD-13S <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in ivory, with Red Cross markings, while RWD-13TS <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in ivory, with a red lightning on the fuselage.|$|R
500|$|The steel {{track is}} {{approximately}} [...] {{in length and}} {{the height of the}} tower is approximately [...] The tower is in an [...] "L" [...] shape with two parallel tracks. When the ride opened, the entire structure <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> white. After the ride was refurbished, the top third of the structure <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> red, the track <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> yellow and the rest <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> blue.|$|R
25|$|The NFL logo <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> at midfield for {{the first}} time since Super Bowl XXX, and the Super Bowl XXXVIII logo was placed on the 25-yard lines. From Super Bowls XXXI through XXXVII, the Super Bowl logo <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> at midfield, and the helmets of the teams painted at the 30-yard lines. From Super Bowl VI through Super Bowl XXX, the NFL logo <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> on the 50-yard line, except for Super Bowls XXV and XXIX. The Super Bowl XXV logo <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> at midfield and the NFL logo <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> at each 35-yard line. In Super Bowl XXIX, the NFL 75th Anniversary logo <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> at midfield with the Super Bowl logo at each 30-yard line.|$|R
5|$|The wolf head crest {{also appears}} in the late 16th-century stained glass of the Withdrawing Room. The chimneypiece in this room is {{decorated}} with female caryatids and bears the arms of Elizabeth I; its plaster would originally have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> and gilded, and traces of this still remain.|$|E
5|$|There {{also are}} various altars and sculptures used as {{decoration}} in the facades of buildings; most Quiriguá monuments have a grand formal monumentality that is rather stiff {{compared to the}} naturalistic grace {{of the art of}} some other Maya sites. Traces of red pigment have been found on some of the monuments and most of the monuments were likely to have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> red, the colour of birth, sacrifice, and renewal.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are {{visible to the}} naked eye as pentimenti. A piece of paper draped over the edge of the table is clearly visible in outline, despite having <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the tip is still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer be visible.|$|E

5|$|Hundreds of stelae {{have been}} {{recorded}} in the Maya region, displaying a wide stylistic variation. Many are upright slabs of limestone sculpted on one or more faces, with available surfaces sculpted with figures carved in relief and with hieroglyphic text. Stelae in a few sites display a much more three-dimensional appearance where locally available stone permits, such as at Copán and Toniná. Plain stelae {{do not appear to}} have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> nor overlaid with stucco decoration, but most Maya stelae were probably brightly painted in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours.|$|E
5|$|In {{previous}} years, the Oval {{was used}} to host {{the final of the}} Irish Cup as one of Northern Ireland's biggest stadiums along with Windsor Park, with the location of the final often being decided on a coin toss. During the 1985 Irish Cup final, Glentoran supporters released a cockerel and a pig that had <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> blue onto the pitch to antagonize Linfield supporters. The Oval {{was used to}} host the final of the County Antrim Shield in 2012. The Oval has also been used to host the Setanta Cup final. It hosted the 2012 final between Belfast's Crusaders representing the IFA Premiership, and County Londonderry based Derry City, representing the League of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The anachronistic wetsuits on the Edwardian ship were {{actually}} heavy-duty overalls that had <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> black. Janet Fielding {{struggled with the}} low cut ball-gown she wore during filming as it threatened to expose her breasts {{on a number of}} occasions. The ball gown worn by Baron was made especially for the serial and was the most expensive costume on display. The newspaper found by the Doctor in Part One was a reprint of The Times from September 1901, while the food and drink served during the party scenes was all real.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> {{dark green}} lined out with red between two cream lines. The buffer beams <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> red. In {{the days of}} the Great Southern Railways the locomotives <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in a plain grey livery, the buffer beams being red.|$|R
50|$|The current roster {{is made up}} {{completely}} {{of second}} generation EMD Switcher Units. Majority of the switchers <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> blue but numerous units <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> different colors including #3 and #17 <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> green, while #1 and #33 have a new yellow and red scheme.|$|R
50|$|Three {{locomotives}} (803, 813, 814) <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in {{a special}} color scheme and later <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> in normal livery.|$|R
5|$|The colours {{would have}} first {{appeared}} bright and crisp, but over five-and-a-half centuries the painting has acquired layers of grey dirt which darken {{the tone and}} render the colours faint and pallid. Normally these layers of dirt would be removed by restorers, but given the delicate and fragile nature of a work painted in a water-soluble medium, {{it is impossible to}} do so without removing large amounts of pigment. The colours as they appear today have faded from their original hues. The Virgin's mantle is now brown but would have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> as blue. Joseph's tabard, once blue, now appears as green. The original indigos of the landscape are lost, while the azurite in Nicodemus's collar has darkened.|$|E
5|$|The {{front side}} of the left wing shows the Agony in the Garden and the Flagellation of Christ. The front {{side of the}} central wing {{represents}} the Crucifixion of Jesus with Saint Catherine and Saint Ursula. These two female figures may have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> last {{as they are in}} a more distinctly Proto-Renaissance style than the rest. The front side of the right wing represents the Crowning with thorns and the Bearing of the Cross, all from the Passion of Jesus.|$|E
5|$|When Lucas Goodwin shoots Underwood {{during a}} {{campaign}} event, Meechum trades fire with the assassin, {{and both are}} killed instantly. Meechum's death {{is one of the}} tragedies Claire mentions in a press briefing for a gun control bill she is sponsoring, and Underwood has him buried in Arlington National Cemetery, a rare privilege for a Secret Service agent, though Meechum may have been eligible, in his own right, as {{a former member of the}} US Military who served in Afghanistan. When Underwood recovers and finds that Meechum's hand tracing has <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> over, he expresses grief and regret at the loss to Claire, who says that Meechum was one of the few people who truly understood them.|$|E
50|$|All Japanese {{police force}} {{vehicles}} <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> and marked {{in the same}} ways. Japanese police vehicles <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> black and white with the upper parts of the vehicle painted white. However, motorcycles are usually all white and riot control and rescue vehicles <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> a steel blue.|$|R
25|$|With the Routemaster's longevity, {{examples}} <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> {{to celebrate}} both the Queen's Silver and Golden Jubilees. In 1977, 25 Routemasters <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> silver and temporarily renumbered SRM1 to SRM25 {{to celebrate the}} Silver Jubilee and, in 2002, 50 buses <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> gold including three RMs and 12 RMLs.|$|R
5000|$|In around 1770 she <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> by Joshua Reynolds. Again in 1771 she <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> by George Willison in [...] "Turkish Dress". That <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> now in Yale Centre for British Art.|$|R
5|$|Women of the emperor's {{family were}} often {{depicted}} dressed as goddesses or divine personifications such as Pax ("Peace"). Portraiture in painting is represented {{primarily by the}} Fayum mummy portraits, which evoke Egyptian and Roman traditions of commemorating the dead with the realistic painting techniques of the Empire. Marble portrait sculpture would have <b>been</b> <b>painted,</b> and while traces of paint have only rarely survived the centuries, the Fayum portraits indicate why ancient literary sources marvelled at how lifelike artistic representations could be.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{camouflage}} {{is the use}} of camouflage {{on military}} aircraft to make them more difficult to see, whether on the ground or in the air. Given the possible backgrounds and lighting conditions, no single scheme works in every situation. A common approach has been a form of countershading, the aircraft being painted in a disruptive pattern of ground colors such as green and brown above, sky colors below. For faster and higher-flying aircraft, sky colors have sometimes been used all over, while helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft used close to the ground are often painted entirely in ground camouflage. Aircraft flying by night have often <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> black, but this actually made them appear darker than the night sky, leading to paler night camouflage schemes. There are trade-offs between camouflage and aircraft recognition markings, and between camouflage and weight. Accordingly, visible light camouflage has been dispensed with when air superiority was not threatened or when no significant aerial opposition was anticipated.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in {{the figure of the}} Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, Prussian blue, vermilion of mercury, and crystals of powdered glass, orpiment and iron oxides. He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> directly onto the wall.|$|E
