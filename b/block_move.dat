25|$|The main {{gameplay}} {{takes place}} in the Nightmare stages. In a nightmarish dreamworld inhabited by other men, who are represented as anthropomorphic sheep, Vincent must climb up giant staircases that are slowly collapsing underneath him and safely reach the top. To accomplish this, Vincent must push, pull and climb blocks as quickly as possible while avoiding various traps such as spikes and ice. Climbing up steps in quick succession increases a score multiplier, {{and at the end of}} the level, players are given an award based on their score. Each stage is split up into numerous areas, culminating in a boss stage in which a nightmarish creature also attempts to kill Vincent. Vincent can move faster depending on how much alcohol he drinks during the day and can earn pillows that allow him to retry levels. There are also several items which can be found or purchased in between stages, such as spare blocks, lightning which removes enemies and energy drinks that allow Vincent to climb more steps at a time. Vincent will die if he falls off the bottom of the level, gets caught by a trap or is killed by a boss, with the game ending if Vincent runs out of retry pillows. In between action stages, Vincent can interact with the other sheep, save his game, learn techniques or spend coins on special items. When playing on easy and normal difficulty, players can push the Select/Back button to correct a single <b>block</b> <b>move.</b>|$|E

This differs from other versions which only have music for the opening and ending segments. Interplay wanted to add additional tunes by Charles Deenen. They also wanted to exchange Jean-François Freitas's music for a different soundtrack, but Chahi did not agree to the change and Delphine's lawyer helped to keep the original intro music. The Apple IIGS and Super NES versions were programmed by Rebecca Heineman, who said: [...] "Since Interplay wouldn't pay for a Super FX chip, I found a way to do it with static RAM on the cart and DMA which got me a great frame rate.

So, frustrated, I shoved my <b>block</b> <b>move</b> code into the DMA registers and use it as RAM running at 3.6 MHz. It worked. I got fast block moves on slow cartridges and made a game using polygons working on a 65816 with pure software rendering."

2500|$|In San Francisco, California protests {{occurred}} {{throughout the}} day and {{in different parts of}} the city with up to 150 people arrested for misdemeanors such as trespassing, resisting arrest and blocking an intersection. Part of the success of the group coordinating named Direct Action was due to utilizing smart mob technologies including text messaging, Google Maps, live video-feeds and internet radio updates. In contrast to the first-day protests in 2003 when the city was effectively shut down in many ways, the protests were focussed on specific targets and conveying messages – [...] "there's little point in barricading the Bay Bridge in a city where most people are against the war anyway." [...] In the morning, a group of 500 worked their way through the morning commute effectively tying-up traffic for hours as the police had to <b>block,</b> <b>move</b> and re-block streets and busses for the procession. The Federal Reserve Bank and Chevron Corporation were also targeted with actions and saw arrests. Starting around noon and lasting for several hours the most [...] "dramatic" [...] protests were a die-in – again blocking the main traffic artery, Market Street – directly in front of California Senator Dianne Feinstein's office. Feinstein supported the Iraq war resolution and subsequent supplemental appropriations bills although she has stated she was deceived by the Bush administration about the weapons of mass destruction. As police arrested dozens of protesters more would take their place. In the evening 7000 marched and rallied in front of San Francisco City Hall hearing speeches including Assemblywoman Carole Migden.

50|$|On {{both the}} Sniper and the Autococker, a back block {{performs}} {{all three of}} these functions. The bolt is attached to the block, while a cocking rod (which is attached to the hammer and designed to catch on the block) passes through it.

The backward movement simultaneously pulls the cocking rod back, causing the hammer to also be pulled back until it re-engages the sear. When the <b>block</b> <b>moves</b> forward, it pushes the bolt (and the paintball) forward, closing the breech. The cocking rod stays pulled back, with the hammer ready to fire.|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{architecture}} was marketed as a RISC machine, {{it was actually}} microprogrammed. It used a [...] "sliding window" [...] register model based on the Berkeley RISC processor, but memory access instructions had complex operation modes that could require many cycles to run. Many register-to-register scalar instructions were executed in a single machine cycle. Initially, floating point instructions were executed totally in microcode, although an optional floating point unit on a separate circuit board was released later. Microprogramming also allowed other non-RISC luxuries such as <b>block</b> <b>move</b> instructions.|$|E
50|$|Platforming is done {{by using}} the Nintendo DS stylus, and tapping the {{touchscreen}} in the direction the player wants the Prince to move. For example, if the player wants to run up a wall, and jump back onto a rope, the player must first tap up the wall, then tap the rope. Sometimes, platforming implements combat as well. Combat is also done using the Nintendo DS stylus. There are three combat options; a sword strike, which causes the Prince to swing his sword to damage enemies; a <b>block</b> <b>move,</b> where the Prince defends himself against enemies; and a magic power triggered by Zal that does no damage, but causes the enemy to recoil, pushing them back should the duo be overwhelmed.|$|E
50|$|However {{because of}} the screen layout, (which was {{top-down}} for each character of 8 lines then advancing to the next character) this was difficult to use for programmers who tried to convert existing software originally written for a system that had another arrangement of the screen layout. So when {{trying to use the}} TMS9918A high resolution mode video memory in the conventional way this method of indirect-access could be far slower than in 8-bit computers with unified memory, like any other piece of RAM. Consequently machines using this VDP could be inefficient at certain graphical tasks, such as scrolling games, which entailed moving the entire background memory. Instead of being able to use the Z80's efficient and fast <b>block</b> <b>move</b> instructions they had to write elaborate routines that first read bytes from video memory into system memory, and then back to another location in video memory, all one byte at a time.|$|E

40|$|Contact {{surfaces}} {{with dry}} Coulomb friction {{are present in}} many engineering structures. A two dimensional model of these systems {{in the form of}} a block-incline is proposed. Its behaviour under harmonic excitation is investigated using finite element method (FEM) with an explicit solver. It was found that the interaction between vibration and friction depends on the state of vibration amplitude and frequency of the harmonic excitation, and on the level of preloading force. The mode of interaction can be classified into three main regions: no change, the <b>block</b> <b>moves</b> up the incline and the <b>block</b> <b>moves</b> down the incline, with mixed modes in the border areas between these domains. The results found by the FEM simulation agree well with previous experimental findings...|$|R
50|$|In February 1996, Pappas Telecasting Companies {{approached}} WGHP about acquiring Fox Kids {{programming for}} its newly acquired WB affiliate WBFX (channel 20; now CW affiliate WCWG). Upon gaining new affiliates through New World, Fox {{executives at the}} time, decided to change the carriage policies for Fox Kids, to allow a station to choose to keep airing it or be granted the right to pass the block to another station in the market. WGHP decided to let the Fox Kids <b>block</b> <b>move</b> to channel 20 beginning in March 1996, becoming the first Fox-owned station that did not run the block, and only one of two (along with WBRC) to do so, until New World merged with Fox in 1997. WGHP added more talk and court shows in the afternoon. WTWB dropped Fox's children's programming in late 2001, when Fox canceled the weekday block nationwide; WGHP chose not to pick up Fox's new Saturday morning cartoon block, Fox Box (later 4Kids TV), which replaced Fox Kids in 2002. As a result, the block did not air {{at all in the}} Piedmont Triad. Fox discontinued children's programming on December 28, 2008, replacing it with a two-hour Saturday morning infomercial block called Weekend Marketplace, which WGHP also declined to air; it airs instead on WMYV.|$|E

The BM operates in a sequence of block moves, and each <b>block</b> <b>move</b> is a computation by some finite transducer S. Any finite transduction S(x) is computable in logarithmic parallel time (say, on an EREW PRAM) by the method of prefix sum applied to the monoid of transformations M S of S. Thus the number R(x) of block moves by a BMM on some input x is a reasonable measure of parallel time. Indeed, the BM i [...] ...|$|E
