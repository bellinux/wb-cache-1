500|$|The TNA World Beer Drinking Championship was {{unveiled}} on November 11, 2007 at TNA's Genesis PPV event, during a backstage segment involving James Storm, Ms. Jackie, and Eric Young. The storyline <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> <b>title</b> {{began on the}} October 25, 2007 episode of Impact!, where Storm defeated Young to advance in the [...] 2007 Fight for the Right Tournament. During the contest, Ms. Jackie, who was accompanying Storm, interfered and helped Storm by standing on the ring apron and distracting Young. When Storm was about to attack Young from behind, Young {{jumped out of the}} way causing Storm to knock Ms. Jackie off the apron and to the floor. Afterwards, Young went to check on Ms. Jackie, thereby allowing Storm to [...] gain the upper hand and win the match. Following the contest, Ms. Jackie and Storm gave Young a beer, which he guzzled down hastily.|$|E

It is unclear what political reality was <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> <b>title.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Lira Paulistana theater, {{located in}} the Pinheiros {{district}} of São Paulo, was a central platform for participants in the [...] "Vanguarda Paulistana" [...] and Itamar Assumpção's name was a regular feature at the venue. Who didn't sing in the Lira, hasn't dreamt (Quem não cantou no Lira, não sonhou in Portuguese), explained J'Cor (Le Dantas Cordeiro), a poet from the scene.

5000|$|The title {{remained}} inactive for 25 {{years until}} being revived by AWA Superstars in late 2005. The storyline <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> <b>title</b> began in Millennium Wrestling Federation, then the AWA affiliate promotion for New England, during the feud between [...] "The Extreme Strongman" [...] Gino Martino and Ox Baker. Baker {{claimed that he}} and The Crusher got into a brawl at Lisowski's bar in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1981, leaving with the brass knuckles title after knocking out Lisowski in the bar-room brawl. Baker then had the title, in actuality a trophy, melted down into a championship belt. He then used the brass knuckles title to lure Martino into a match {{with a member of}} Ox Baker's Army. On September 24, Martino won the title after defeating Kamala the Ugandan Giant in a [...] "King of the Jungle" [...] death match at the MWF's [...] "Road to the Gold" [...] in Lynn, Massachusetts. A title defense against The Missing Link at [...] "Soul Survivor III" [...] on November 5, 2005, ended in a no-contest. In the next few two months he also defended the title against The Outpatient, Leo Venis, and Makua of The Big Islanders in both No Disqualification and Falls Count Anywhere matches.|$|E
