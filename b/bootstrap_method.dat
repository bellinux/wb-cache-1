40|$|Today, {{many small}} {{businesses}} are experiencing problems with obtaining long-term external financing. Financial <b>bootstrapping</b> refers to <b>methods</b> used by small businesses to obtain resources, without relying on long-term external financing from debtholders and/or new owners. Instead financing of resources occur in alternative ways. This {{has been found to}} have a great importance for the development and survival of small businesses. Financial bootstrapping is commonly used among small businesses and there are a wide variety of methods to use. Since financial bootstrapping plays a crucial role of SMEs, there is an interest to investigate what influences decisions regarding the choice of <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>method,</b> which in turn can help small businesses to make more informed decisions. This study aims to theoretically develop and empirically test a model for the selection of financial bootstrapping by describing the use of financial bootstrapping in small business and test how underlying factors affects the choice of <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>method.</b> The study has a quantitative research method with a hypothetical-deductive approach in which a web-based survey was sent to a total of 1, 554 small businesses in the manufacturing industry. The results showed that when the owner perceives that the company's financial position is good, the use of the financial bootstrapping decreases, with the largest decrease occurring specifically for the internally oriented <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods.</b> Selection of financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>method</b> is also affected by how much resources the owner perceive that there is in the environment. If the owner perceive that there a wide array of resources in the environment, the use of the internally oriented <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> decreases. The strength of the owner's social network affects the choices of financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>method.</b> A stronger relationship with contacts in the social network leads to the socially oriented <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> being used to a greater extent. Finally, this study could not find support for that the owner's tolerance of ambiguity impact the choice of financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>method.</b> Validerat; 20150616 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

40|$|In {{the year}} 2010, {{the number of}} enterprising {{individuals}} increased by 2. 5 percent from previous year, which is positive for Swedish enterprise. In Sweden there are about 900 000 companies and small businesses represent about 99 percent of these companies. The fact that small businesses are having difficulty obtaining outside financing is a widely discussed subject because financing is of great importance to small business survival and growth, to drive economic growth and to create new jobs in the community. To overcome the challenges {{it is important that}} companies find new creative solutions to obtain the necessary resources they need to operate the business. This alternative financial system is called financial bootstrapping and is a strategy to finance companies through the use of methods that avoid companies to raise equity capital or borrow money. The study aims to create a deeper understanding of financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> in small growth companies by: (1) describe the financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> that small growth companies may use, (2) identify underlying factors for the use of financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> in small growth companies, (3) identify how the use can be expressed in small growth companies development and (4) to develop a model of financial bootstrapping in small growth companies. We have made a qualitative study consisting of interviews with small growth companies in Sweden. The assumption that financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> occurs primarily at the beginning or when companies have difficulty obtaining capital tends to be inconsistent with our results, as small growth companies are using financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> repeatedly during the company's development. The results of the study suggest that small growth companies are using financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods.</b> It appears that there are underlying factors for the use and the three most common factors are; lower cost, lack of capital and reduce risk. There are also methods used more or less in small growth companies and they tend to use financial <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> from a financial aspect.

The main limitation is that one execution of standard Microsoft Excel Solver has a limit of 200 simultaneous optimizations. This limit can be overcome by multiple independent executions of Solver. Due to the wide accessibility of Microsoft Excel software and ease of use for these two methods, employing the Monte Carlo and <b>bootstrap</b> <b>methods</b> in spreadsheets is strongly recommended to estimate nonlinear regression parameter uncertainties.|$|R

We ex-amined the performance of two supertree <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>methods</b> on four published data sets that each include sequence data from more than 100 genes. In "input tree bootstrapping, " input gene trees are sampled with replacement and then combined in replicate supertree analyses; in "stratified bootstrapping, " trees from each gene's separate (conventional) boot-strap tree set are sampled randomly with replacement and then combined. Generally, support values from both supertree <b>bootstrap</b> <b>methods</b> were similar or slightly lower than corresponding bootstrap values from a total evidence, or superma-trix, analysis. Yet, supertree bootstrap support also exceeded supermatrix bootstrap support {{for a number of}} clades.
