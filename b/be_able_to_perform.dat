5|$|Although in {{operational}} use the Vulcan typically carried various nuclear armaments, {{the type}} {{also had a}} secondary conventional role. While performing conventional combat missions, the Vulcan could carry up to 21 bombs inside its bomb bay. From the 1960s, the various Vulcan squadrons would routinely conduct conventional training missions; the aircrews were expected to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> conventional bombing missions {{in addition to the}} critical nuclear strike mission the Vulcan normally performed.|$|E

The space which is freed up after the TRIM command may be at random locations spread throughout the SSD. It will take a number of passes of writing data and garbage collecting before those spaces are consolidated to show improved performance.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{case studies}} of brain damage have shown that damage to {{areas of the brain}} (such as the {{anterior}} prefrontal cortex) results in the reduction or elimination of inhibitions, with a corresponding radical change in behaviour. When the damage occurs to adults, they may still <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> moral reasoning; but when it occurs to children, they may never develop that ability.|$|E

It was later announced on February 23, 2017 that Beyoncé would no longer <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> at the festival due to doctor's concerns regarding her pregnancy. The festival owners announced that she will instead headline the 2018 festival. Upon the announcement of Beyoncé's departure from the festival lineup, ticket prices dropped by 12%.|$|E
5|$|The Phantom {{represented}} {{a significant improvement}} to the RAAF's ground attack capabilities. The F-4Es were more technologically advanced than the Canberra, as they could fly at supersonic speeds, were equipped with air-to-air radar and missiles, and had an inertial navigation system, ground-attack computer and a cannon. The Phantoms were capable of operating in several roles; the RAAF primarily used them as strike aircraft. This role was selected to prepare aircrew to operate F-111s, and most training exercises were focused on tasks that the F-111s would also <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} stages, {{the patient is}} {{completely}} dependent upon caregivers. Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech. Despite the loss of verbal language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional signals. Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme apathy and exhaustion are much more common symptoms. People with Alzheimer's disease will ultimately not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> even the simplest tasks independently; muscle mass and mobility deteriorates {{to the point where}} they are bedridden and unable to feed themselves. The cause of death is usually an external factor, such as infection of pressure ulcers or pneumonia, not the disease itself.|$|E

5|$|For the 2009 remake, {{stuntman}} Derek Mears {{was hired}} to portray Jason Voorhees at the recommendation of makeup special effects supervisor Scott Stoddard. Mears's pleasant demeanor had the studio worried {{about his ability to}} portray such a menacing character on screen, but Mears assured them he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> the role. When Mears auditioned for the role he was asked why they should hire an actor over just another guy in a mask. As Mears explained, portraying Jason is similar to Greek mask work, where the mask and the actor are two separate entities, and, based on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance.|$|E
