40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} was to analyse growth {{abilities}} of hybrids (?Nb x ?Kal) in comparison with original parental population. Further were evaluated reproductive properties of parental breeds of rabbits New Zealand White and Californian and their combination (?Nb x ?Kal). Enter data were gathered in total from 27 litters. Obtained data were summarized and statistically treated in MS Excel programme and STATISTICA version 9. To assess the development of live weight, the rabbits were weighed at 7 -day intervals from birth {{until the end of}} fattening, it is to the age of 126 days. For the analysis of reproductive abilities was in single females litters observed the number of all born offspring, from that the number of live-born and still-born offspring and the number of weaned offspring. Further, the length of gravidity, the length of season and age at weaning, milkiness and total mortality were observed. The assessment of growth and reproductive abilities was made in dependence on sequence of litter and on the observed calendar year. The results showed higher increases in 60 th, 90 th and 120 th days of age hybrid offspring than a breeds pattern book by paternal population requires. The achievement of high weight gains confirms the suitability of using these hybrids for intensive production of quality dietetic rabbit meat. It was also achieved excellent results in milkiness females in the observed breeding. Its average value was 3965 g, which is comparable with milkiness of broiler breeds in large breedings. Total results confirmed the suitability of using Californian rabbit breeds in a maternal position and the New Zealand White in a paternal position to create commercial hybrids intended <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b> Their hybrid offspring reach better growth ability than original parental population. Results of this study can be specific recommendation especially for small breeders of meat-type rabbits when choosing a suitable combination of <b>breeds</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in Bonke Woreda of Gamo Gofa Zone, {{southern}} Ethiopia, with the objectives of assessment of fattening and marketing system, and effect of concentrate supplementation with locally available feeds on fattening performance of indigenous cattle. The study involved survey to assess cattle fattening and marketing practices, and action research to evaluate the effect of homemade concentrate from locally available feed resources on fattening performance and economic return of indigenous cattle. The survey part involved interviewing 120 households purposively selected from six kebeles in three agro ecologies. Focus group discussions and key informants have been employed to enrich the data. The feeding trial was conducted in Danible Ottora Kebele,with 18 (9 castrate and 9 non – castrate) indigenous cattle for 70 days excluding adaptation period of 15 days. Treatments included farmer’s practices alone (T 1); T 1 + concentrate supplementation at 1 % of body weight (T 2); and T 1 + concentrate supplementation at 1. 5 % of body weight (T 3). Maize stover and stubble grazing was provided as a basic ration which was the farmers feeding practice. Experimental animals were blocked by farms/households and randomly assigned to three feeding treatments separately. Heart girth and body condition score were recorded while body weight was estimated from heart girth using regression equation developed for zebu cattle. The data were analyzed using the General Linear Model Procedure of statistical package for Social Science (SPSS 16). The result showed that the most dominant cattle <b>breed</b> used <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> in the study area was indigenous. The major source of cattle <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> was through purchasing from market (69. 1 %) followed by raising at home (24. 2 %). Almost all fatteners in highland (95 %) and mid-altitude (100 %) were engaged in fattening castrate. Concerning physiological stage of the fattening animals, most of the producers (83 %) use matured & old oxen. In highland, majority of the farmers fatten cattle once within a year (60 %), while it was three times per year for mid-altitude (42. 5 %) and two times per year for lowland (70 %) agro-ecologies. The majority (90 %) {{of the respondents indicated that}} the most common criteria used to decide fattening period was body condition of the animals. Majority of the respondents in the highland, mid altitude and lowland <b>fatten</b> cattle <b>for</b> six months, three months and five months, respectively. The major types of feed resources <b>for</b> the <b>fattening</b> animal were natural pasture, crop residues, stubble grazing, grass hay and feed supplements. The major criteria used while purchasing fattening cattle included frame size, heath, body condition, coat color and price of animals. The experience in cattle fattening, large cattle population, diverse & suitable agroecology, availability of crop residues, high irrigation potential, initiation of the introduction of improved forage species and cheap labor force reveals the potential of the area <b>for</b> improved cattle <b>fattening.</b> However, feed shortage, shortage of land, prevalence of disease, poor access for credit service and marketing information, and underdeveloped cattle marketing were the major constraints that hinder the performance of cattle fattening. The feeding trial showed that average daily gain were highest (p< 0. 05) for animals supplemented with T 3 followed by T 2 and T 1. Similarly, the net return was higher (P< 0. 05) for the supplemented group (T 2 & T 3) compared to non-supplemented group kept under farmers management (T 1). Among the supplemented groups, marginal rate of return was higher for animals supplemented with T 2 compared to T 3. Thus, it can be concluded that when resources are not meager smallholders producers could use supplementation at 1. 5 % of body weight for higher return. However, when resources are limited producers are advised to supplement at 1 % of body weight for higher marginal rate of return. Detail research work on availability, nutrient composition and digestibility of the major feed resource are recommended for further work. Global Affairs Canad...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{determine}} how forage triticale in diets <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> broilers influence the body weight and weight gain of broiler chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b> The survey was conducted on 400 chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> provenance Ross 308 for a period of 42 days. On this occasion, four groups of chickens were formed, with 100 chickens being treated in each group, as follows: K (classic mixture <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> broilers) and O-I (mixtures with triticale variety Kg 20), O-II (mixtures with triticale Favorit) and O-III group (mixtures with triticale Trijumf). The highest average body mass in the groups of chickens (male, female and chicks of both sexes), was scored by broiler chickens of O-II-group. The minimum food consumption for 42 -day-old chicks was achieved by group O-I (4. 275 kg), and the most by O-II group (4. 359 kg). Chickens of O-II- and III-O-group had the best feed conversion, while the chickens of O-I-group had a slightly poorer feed conversion. The mortality of the groups of chickens for the entire period of the study was the lowest in O-II-group, at 2. 0 %, and the highest mortality was found in O-III-group (6. 0 %). The production index was the highest in O-II-group (202. 726) and the lowest in O-I-group. The results achieved in this research indicate that the use of tested triticale cultivars significantly affected the weight gain and body mass of chicks and have nutritional and economic justification.

40|$|To {{throw some}} light on the subject of succulence <b>for</b> winter <b>fattening</b> of lambs, with especial {{reference}} to the use of corn silage in that capacity, a series of experiments was conducted during three winters, beginning December, 1906. These experiments were planned to indicate the principal results attending the feeding of succulent feed to fattening lambs and to furnish a comparison between the old time special crops for this purpose, and corn silage, the only succulent feed practicable for winter use on an extensive scale. The immediate objects of the work were as follows: 1. To compare a ration of grain and hay <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> lambs with rations containing succulent feed. 2. To compare sugar beets, mangels, turnips, rutabagas, cabbage, and corn silage as sources of succulence <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> lambs. 3. To determine whether succulent feed is essential to rapid gains, high condition, and quality of finish...|$|R

40|$|Amaferm is the {{fermentation}} {{product of}} a non-pathogenic and non-genetically modified strain of Aspergillus oryzae mixed with wheat bran as carrier. It is proposed {{to be used as}} feed additive to dairy cows and cattle <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at doses between 2 and 5 g head- 1 day- 1 in order to improve production performance. According to Regulation (EC) No 1831 / 2003, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) should deliver an opinion on the efficacy and the safety of the product Amaferm for the target animals, consumers, users and the environment. Amaferm {{has been shown to be}} capable of producing a positive effect on milk yield of dairy cows. However, evidence has only been provided for a dose of 3 g head- 1 day- 1 instead of the minimum recommended dose of 2 g head- 1 day- 1 claimed by the Applicant. However, only one out of four studies with cattle <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> showed a persistent improvement of weight gain and feed conversion with Amaferm. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel considers the data provided to be insufficient to draw final conclusions on efficacy of Amaferm in cattle <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> kept under common production conditions...|$|R

40|$|Utilization of Philiostigma reticulatum (DC.) Hochst. Pods and Cajanus Cajan (L.) Millsp. Leaves in Combination of Urea <b>for</b> <b>Fattening</b> Mossi Type and South Djallonke Sheep in Burkina. The study {{evaluated}} {{the potential of}} Piliostigma reticulatum pods (PrP) and Cajanus cajan leaves (CcL) <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> sheep. The results indicate that both PrP and CcL provide adequate nutrition for growing lambs. However, when used to replace the cottonseed meal (CSM) on a same dry matter weight part basis, the substitution causes total nitrogen to decrease in the diet. These ingredients must be used in combination with adequate level of CSM and probably with a higher energy/nitrogen ratio. Benefit-cost analysis shows that diets involving less than 30 % of external inputs provide the highest benefits...|$|R
