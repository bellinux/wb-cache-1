5|$|At about 5 a.m., Parsons {{stopped at}} a Texaco service station 23 miles to the north. He was wearing Ernest's clothes and had assumed his identity. Parsons told the station {{attendant}} he needed to hose out red construction paint from the car's interior and offered to give him Ernest's construction tools. The attendant said that he observed Parsons throwing away clothing, books, posters and carpentry tools into a dumpster. Parsons asked the attendant about the distance to Denver and spoke of Ernest's 9-year-old son as his own. He purchased cigarettes and food with Ernest's MasterCard credit card before leaving. At 7:23 a.m., Parsons used the credit card to check into a Quality Inn at Richfield, Utah. He used the card again at about 10 a.m. to purchase seat covers and floor mats from Kmart {{to cover up the}} blood stains in the car. A clerk called the Richfield Police Department after Parsons attempted to purchase $300 worth of items at 12:34 p.m. and the credit card was found to be over its limit. The attendant back at the Texaco station called the Beaver County Sheriff's Office after discovering bloody items in the dumpster. Deputy Raymond Goodwin found Ernest's <b>bank</b> <b>statement</b> and Parsons' bloody clothes in the dumpster. After calling Ernest's wife Beverley, the officers concluded that the person who visited the service station was not Richard Ernest. At about 4:25 p.m. on August 31, a Utah Highway Patrol officer found Parsons sleeping in Ernest's car at the Red Creek rest area on Interstate 70, west of Salina, Utah. When Parsons was brought into the Richfield police station where the bloody clothes were gathered, he continued to insist that he was Ernest. When officers asked for his street address, Parsons asked for a lawyer. Sheriff Kenneth Yardley recalled that Parsons asked if he could keep his book to read.|$|E
25|$|The {{customer}} debits {{his or her}} savings/bank (asset) {{account in}} his ledger when making a deposit (and the account is normally in debit), while the customer credits a credit card (liability) account in his ledger every time he spends money (and the account is normally in credit). When the customer reads his <b>bank</b> <b>statement,</b> the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits, and debits for withdrawals of funds. The customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the <b>bank</b> <b>statement.</b> If the customer is overdrawn, {{he will have a}} negative balance, reflected as a debit balance on the <b>bank</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{reason why}} {{individuals}} see debits and credits {{in the above}} manner, is that the <b>bank</b> <b>statement</b> presented by the bank to the customer is the bank's view of the account. The bank views money in a chequing account as money the bank owes to the customer, i.e. a liability, and in the rules of accounting, an increase to a liability account is a credit. Likewise, when a bank lends money to a customer and places the money into the customer's chequing account, the bank has increased its obligation to pay that money, which is a liability, and this increase is a credit and appears in the credit column of a <b>bank</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|E
50|$|Historically, <b>bank</b> <b>{{statements}}</b> were paper statements produced monthly, quarterly or even annually. Since {{the introduction}} of computers in banks in the 1960s, <b>bank</b> <b>statements</b> have generally been produced monthly. <b>Bank</b> <b>statements</b> for accounts with small transaction volumes, such as investments or savings accounts, are usually produced less frequently. Depending on the financial institution, <b>bank</b> <b>statements</b> may also include certain features such as the cancelled cheques (or their images) that cleared through the account during the statement period.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bank</b> <b>statements</b> {{are also}} {{needed in order}} to {{investigate}} a company. The owner's personal <b>bank</b> <b>statements</b> are needed as well as the company's <b>bank</b> <b>statements.</b> If the company is the one who wanted the investigation to be conducted then they most likely suspect an employee. Therefore, <b>bank</b> <b>statements</b> would be needed from the individual being investigated. They will show how much cash is coming {{into and out of the}} company. They will also show where the money is going and where it is coming from, who are the clients, and if any money has been transferred to foreign accountants.|$|R

25|$|In 1980, Hunt nearly made a {{comeback}} with McLaren at the United States Grand Prix West, asking for $1million for the race. This opportunity came about when regular driver Alain Prost broke his wrist during {{practice for the}} previous round in South Africa, and the French rookie was not fully fit to drive at Long Beach. The team's main sponsor, Marlboro, offered half the figure but negotiations ended after Hunt broke his leg while skiing. In 1982 Bernie Ecclestone, owner of the Brabham team, offered Hunt a salary of £2.6million for the season but was rejected by Hunt. In 1990, Hunt was in financial trouble {{with the loss of}} £180,000 investing in Lloyd's of London and considered {{a comeback}} with the Williams team. He had tested on the Paul Ricard Circuit a few months prior to test modern cars and was several seconds off the pace and believed he would be physically prepared.
