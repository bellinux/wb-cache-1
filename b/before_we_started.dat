[...] "I was singing the line, 'Don't let the bastards drag you down,' feeling determined rather than angry. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started,</b> Rab [...] said, 'What {{are you thinking about}} this U2 cover?' I said, 'Ach, it'll be easy: just make it sound bigger than U2'." ...|$|E
500|$|... "At one point, I asked Ellen Page <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> shooting, ‘hat do {{you think}} Juno listens to?’ And she said [...] She went on my computer, played the songs, and I {{fell in love with}} it. Diablo and I {{discussed}} putting a Moldy Peaches song in it where the characters would sing to each other. I got in touch with Kimya Dawson of The Moldy Peaches and she started sending me her work, which was beautiful, and that became a lot of the soundtrack." ...|$|E
500|$|StarGate's Tor Erik Hermansen, said [...] "Rihanna {{came to us}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> {{recording}} [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] {{and said}} ‘I feel great about myself. I {{want to go back}} to having fun, I want to make happy and up-tempo records'." [...] Sean Garrett compared the sound of the new tracks with her previous hit singles [...] "Umbrella" [...] and [...] "Rude Boy". In an interview for MTV UK, the vice president of Def Jam Recordings compared the upcoming Rihanna album with Michael Jackson's Thriller saying, [...] "Rihanna is coming along incredibly. I’m trying to push her to where every song will be a hit from one to 12. I’m talking about NO album fillers. Our bar for this album is Michael Jackson's ‘Thriller’." ...|$|E

500|$|Faye Marsay, who {{portrayed the}} Waif, spoke about her scenes and filming with Williams, saying, [...] " [...] I {{think we did}} a month in Belfast <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> shooting. We went into the stunt tent and lived there. It was choreographed like a dance. Maisie is so well coordinated and good at what she does. I'm {{a little bit less}} coordinated and easily pissed off. I would drop the stick down and go, [...] "I can't do it!" [...] And she would {{encourage}} me. She's so supportive. We did a month, and then the day before the cameras turned on, we would go through the moves a couple of times so we wouldn't hurt each other. There were a few times we clipped each other. I remember getting her in the stomach really bad one time, and she nearly cut my ear off at one point. It was fun. It was a lot of fun, but we were exhausted as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Jayma Mays commented {{of their}} relationship: [...] "Oh no! I don’t know if I can say! That’s a hard {{question}} {{because when you}} see the scenes of Emma and Will, you obviously think 'Oh of course they’re supposed to be together, of course, of course!' but the fact is, is that he’s a married man and Emma knows that’s wrong, and she doesn’t want to be a homewrecker. She doesn’t want to ruin a relationship. So I guess in a perfect world, she could find someone like Will, or maybe Ken Tanaka (laughs) can become a little bit more like Will. But maybe it’s all about respect. Maybe if she can respect Ken enough, that will develop into true love." [...] She also commented of her co-star Matthew Morrison (Will): [...] "We were friends. We knew each other <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> this job. We worked together once before. So, that’s always helpful when you know the person that you’re working with, and you already feel comfortable around them. But yeah, he’s a really good friend, so that makes that stuff a little bit easier." ...|$|E
500|$|Avatar {{has been}} called [...] "without a doubt the most epic piece of {{environmental}} advocacy ever captured on celluloid.... The film hits all the important environmental talking-points—virgin rain forests threatened by wanton exploitation, indigenous peoples who have much to teach the developed world, a planet which functions as a collective, interconnected Gaia-istic organism, and evil corporate interests {{that are trying to}} destroy it all." [...] Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film's environmental message, saying that he envisioned Avatar as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world. [...] He said that he created Pandora as [...] "a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> to pave it and build malls, and shopping centers. [...] So it's really an evocation of the world we used to have." [...] He told Charlie Rose that [...] "we are going to go through a lot of pain and heartache if we don't acknowledge our stewardship responsibilities to nature." [...] Interviewed by Terry Gross of National Public Radio, he called Avatar a satire on the sense of human entitlement: [...] " [...] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully theirs is the same sense of entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye. It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. And sometimes we do it in a very naked and imperialistic way, and other times we do it in a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing. A sense of entitlement. And we can't just go on in this unsustainable way, just taking what we want and not giving back." [...] An article in the Belgium paper De Standaard agreed: [...] "It's about the brutality of man, who shamelessly takes what isn't his." ...|$|E
