The aim of this report is to propose a revised nomenclature for allergic and related reactions {{that can be used}} independently of target organ or patient age group. The nomenclature is based on the present knowledge of the mechanisms which initiate and mediate allergic reactions. However, the intention has not been to revise the nomenclature of nonallergic hypersensitivity. S. G. O. Johansson 1, J. O’B Hourihane 2, J. Bousquet 3...|$|E
40|$|Hawaii is synonym with dream {{vacation}} {{for a lot}} of Americans. Nevertheless, even {{if someone}} has decided to go to Hawaii, choose an island might still be difficult. Hawaii is an archipelago included 6 inhabited islands. Every island has its own particularities. Depending on the expectation that a tourist can have, one island might be more adequate for him or her. In this paper, the author wants to select the more suitable island regarding her own expectations. An Hierarchical Decision Model has been created with 4 criteria and 11 subcriteria. The four most popular islands have been selected for the alternatives. The experts have different background {{in order to get a}} <b>broad</b> <b>opinion.</b> They made pairwise comparison using the HDM tool to evaluate the best island. Literature has been used as a data based for 2 Experts. The literature includes information from official website and scientific paper. The result of this research has shown that Oahu is the best island regarding the criteria chosen. For future research, we would focused more on the methodology than on the topic studied in this paper. THe HDM Tool is a complex tool and utilisation can be biased by a lot of factors. It would interesting to elaborate a protocol to avoid at utmost those biases...|$|E
40|$|The views {{expressed}} in this speech are my own and are not necessarily shared by {{the other members of}} the Executive Board of the Riksbank. I would like to thank Jill Billborn, Johanna Fager Wettergren and Per Åsberg-Sommar for their great assistance in the writing of this speech. Four years after the financial crisis broke out, we are still living with its consequences: a sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, sluggish recovery in the United States and United Kingdom, with unemployment entrenched at high levels and a world beyond Europe and the United States that is finding it hard to adjust to the fact that their most important export markets are faltering. The realisation that the costs of financial crises are dreadfully high has led to a general understanding that economic policy must focus much more on preventing such crises. Here in Sweden, we have coped relatively well through the recent turbulent years. But, even here, unemployment remains on a high level – and part of the high Swedish growth rate has merely been a recovery from the great fall in GDP in 2008 and 2009. It is well-known that I have advocated a lower repo rate to push down unemployment faster and to push up an inflation rate that is currently below our target of two per cent.

40|$|Abstract. Pareto welfare {{criterion}} {{based only on}} people’s willingness {{to pay for the}} project’s output is regarded by many as being a narrow interpre-tation of an improvement in social well-being. A <b>broader</b> <b>opinion</b> is that even though poorer individuals may be less able to pay for a particular benefit, they may obtain greater utility from it. In line with the <b>broader</b> <b>opinion,</b> this paper looks at regional welfare weights in India on the ba-sis of a conventional consumption utility function which assumes dimin-ishing marginal utility. Estimated parameters are; elasticity of marginal utility of consumption, and per capita national and regional incomes which are used in the calculation of welfare weights for 17 states of In-dia...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - In total, 90, 000 of the 1. 26 {{million people}} {{applying}} for asylum in the EU in 2015 were unaccompanied children. The Dublin III Regulations provided a unique legal situation where unaccompanied {{young people in}} the Calais Jungle potentially had the right to be reunited with family in the UK. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the substantial challenges presented by carrying out medico-legal assessment of this group in the Calais Jungle. Design/methodology/approach - The authors consider the refugee crisis from a mental health and legal perspective. The authors provide two case examples to contextualise and describe the work. The authors draw from the observations and the literature to discuss the impact of living in the Calais Jungle on young people, the challenges the authors overcame to carry out the assessments and the needs of refugees following settling in the UK. Findings - The authors conclude that the Calais Jungle was a toxic environment not suitable for young refugees’ continued emotional development or recovery from trauma. The current legal process to relocate a young person to the UK is time consuming and labour intensive. The authors note that these concerns are not unique to the Jungle, nor have they ended with its demolition. The difficulties young refugees face with mental illness continues following their arrival to the UK. Originality/value - This was the first successful attempt since the Dublin III Regulations to seek a legal route to bring unaccompanied refugee minors from France to the UK. This paper was co-written by both the legal and mental health professionals involved in the cases providing a <b>broad</b> <b>opinion</b> across both disciplines...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background While {{data for}} preterm {{children}} health-related {{quality of life}} are available, there are little data on the perception of health-related quality of life evaluation by physicians who manage preterm children, or its use in real life and decision making. The aim of this qualitative study is to highlight among physicians, themes of reflection about health-related {{quality of life in}} extremely preterm children (less than 28 weeks’ gestation). Methods Focus groups at a French University Hospital with physicians who manage extremely preterm children: obstetricians, intensive care physicians, neonatal physicians and paediatric neurologists. The focus groups allowed the participants to discuss (drawing on their personal experience), three principal topics regarding the health-related quality of life of preterm children: representation, expectations in daily practice and evaluation method. Results We included fourteen participants in the three focus groups. Many themes emerged from the focus groups: approaches for defining health-related quality of life and difficulties of utilization, the role that health-related quality of life should have in the system of care, the problem of standards and evidence-based decision making. Physicians had difficulties with taking positions regarding this concept. There were no differences by gender, age or seniority, but points of view varied by specialty and type of practice. Physicians who had longer specialized care for extremely preterm children were more sensitive to the impact of preterm complications on health-related quality of life. Conclusions This study provides preliminary results about physicians’ perspective on the health-related quality of life of extremely preterm children. The themes emerged from the focus groups are classically described in other domains but not all in so clear a way (definition, interests and limits, ethical reflection). This approach was never developed in the field of prematurity with well-knowed consequences on quality of life. These results require to be confirmed on a larger representative sample.

40|$|Juvenile {{delinquency}} plays a {{big role}} in our society. It causes an inequality and an uncertainty in the present society. This is why our project addresses juvenile delinquency. Using relevant theories on the topic, we aim to investigate the genesis of juvenile delinquency, and the prevention of it. In our analysis, we will use the theories of three sociologists, Roberts K. Merton, Michel Maffesoli and Pierre Bourdieu, to explain how juvenile delinquency occurs. The project is developed through case studies in Brøndby and Albertslund municipality. We picked these two municipalities because it will present us with a more nuanced insight in the prevention of juvenile delinquency. To get a broader perspective of the exact preventive actions’ impact, we find {{that it is necessary to}} use both qualitative and quantitative methodology. Through the use of interviews and tables, this project investigates municipal local policies actions and whether these are effective or not. Through our analysis we will find that there are many different explanations to the genesis of the phenomenon: juvenile delinquency. Robert K. Merton believes that there occurs a pressure of expectations in society, caused by the expectations of success in life. Michel Maffesoli finds that juvenile delinquency can occur due to the consequences of modern social communities. Pierre Bourdieu believes that juvenile delinquency is caused through a bad habitus formation and a negative development of an individuals capital forms. Furthermore we find, through our analysis and discussion, that some preventive actions does not work. For an example: intimidation. But it is not easy to conclude which actions work and which actions do not work. Our result shows that juvenile delinquency is a problem despite a national decline in the number of reported juvenile crimes. Reasons for juvenile delinquency can be explained in many ways; also there is a <b>broad</b> <b>opinion</b> in the municipalities on how to prevent this in the best possible way...|$|E
40|$|I {{develop a}} dynamic model of law {{creation}} {{in which the}} court is uncertain about the ideal rule. The court learns about the ideal rule through the cases it hears, which are in turn the result of rational choices of agents responding to the court's previous decisions. Learning requires experimentation, and since agents choose optimally, learning is only possible experimentation is incentive compatible for the agent. The court provides incentives to the agent by setting penalties, and writing opinions that commit the court to sanctioning or punishing various actions. The model generates several predictions. First, the efficacy of opinion writing is asymmetric- the court has an incentive to write <b>broad</b> permissive <b>opinions,</b> but no cor-responding incentive to write <b>broad</b> restrictive <b>opinions.</b> Second, the court's learning is inefficient- it does not induce learning that minimizes the expected future cost of uncer-tainty. Instead, the court will induce experimentation that {{increases the likelihood that}} it can amend its permissive opinion- since this policy tool is more efficacious. Third, since the court cannot always amend an opinion, it has a incentive to preemptively write <b>broad</b> <b>opinions.</b> I would like to thank Stephen Morris and John Londregan for their helpful comments...|$|R

50|$|According to Professor Michałowski “not only in {{the view}} of the {{scientific}} world but also in a <b>broader</b> <b>opinion</b> of a civilised society, the current cultural level of a given country is judged based on whether it has its own excavations in Egypt”. On his initiative in 1936 archaeological works were started in Edfu and lasted till 1939. The expedition was accompanied by archaeologists from the University of Warsaw and the French Institute for Eastern Archaeology. These were the first excavations with participation of Polish archaeologists in the Mediterranean area. The works were performed on the pharaohs’ necropolis as well as in the ancient city of the Greek-Roman and Byzantian period. The number and artistic quality of historical monuments obtained during the first campaign (1936) enabled the organisation of an exhibition in the Gallery of Ancient Art in the National Museum in Warsaw, which was opened already in June 1937.|$|R

40|$|This study {{compares the}} agenda-setting cues of {{traditional}} media alongside those of online media {{in general and}} social media in particular. The main line of inquiry concerns (a) whether people posting content to openly accessible social media outlets may be acting in response to mainstream news coverage, possibly as a “corrective ” to perceived imbalances in that coverage, or (b) whether such posts seem to have influenced professional {{media coverage of the}} issue, possibly reflecting <b>broader</b> <b>opinion</b> dynamics. We do not view these as competing hypotheses, as this relationship may run in both directions and shift at different points in the evolution of an issue. Our goal is to establish important preliminary findings by addressing these questions {{in the context of a}} particular issue that is (a) prominently covered in professional media, and (b) contentious enough to inspire individuals to “take the media into their own hands ” by producing and publishing their own “coverage. ” Proposition 8 in California, which amended the state constitution to define marriage as the exclusive right of opposite-sex couples, provides this context.

5000|$|In a {{separate}} opinion, Grier concurred in full {{with the majority}} opinion delivered by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney. Taney stated that, based on {{the language of the}} Constitution and the founders’ feelings toward African Americans, the Court did not consider Dred Scott to be an American citizen, thus restricting his right to sue in federal court. For practical purposes, Taney could have ended his opinion at this point. He pushed further, though, invalidating the Missouri Compromise under which Scott used to declare his freedom. Justice Grier initially discouraged such a broad ruling, claiming that the Court should restrict itself after ruling on Scott’s status as a non-citizen. Wanting to change his peer’s mind, Justice John Catron wrote to President-elect James Buchanan and asked him to lobby Grier for a <b>broader</b> <b>opinion.</b> Buchanan happily agreed, and he exchanged a series of letters with Grier, persuading the justice. In his separate opinion, Justice Grier wrote that he “concurred with the opinion of the court as delivered by the Chief Justice that the act of Congress of 6th March, 1820, (the Missouri Compromise) is unconstitutional and void and that, assuming the facts as stated in the opinion, the plaintiff cannot sue as a citizen of Missouri in the courts of the United States.” ...|$|R
