Stripped of all salvageable material, she was scuttled in 1926 as a breakwater, and her remains are still visible today.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{manufacture}} of artificial plant ice was still negligible in 1880, it began to grow in volume {{towards the end of}} the century as technological improvements finally allowed the production of plant ice at a competitive price. Typically ice plants first took hold in more distant locations where natural ice was at a cost disadvantage. The Australian and Indian markets were already dominated by plant ice, and ice plants began to be built in Brazil during the 1880s and 1890s, slowly coming to replace imported ice. In the U.S., plants began to become more numerous in the southern states. The long distance transportation companies continued to use cheap natural ice for the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> refrigeration needs, but they now used purchased local plant ice at key points across the US, to allow for surge demand and to avoid the need to hold reserve stocks of natural ice. After 1898 the British fishing industry too began to turn to plant ice to refrigerate its catches.|$|E

5|$|Dairying is only {{economic}} in Wales with {{a sufficiently}} large herd in a productive lowland area. Hand-milking a few cows in a byre {{is a thing}} of the past and nowadays herds are milked by machine in modern parlours, two or three times a day.

In general, the cows graze outdoors in summer and spend their winter under cover, often in cubicles, the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> feed being silage. Milk prices barely cover the costs of production, margins are tight, and there are fewer family-run dairy farms each year.

5|$|In Johannesburg in the 1950s, {{crime was}} a day-to-day reality, and Sophiatown was {{the nucleus of}} all reef crimes. Gangsters were city-bred and spoke a mixture of Afrikaans and English, known as tsotsitaal.

The names the Gestapo and the Berliners reflect their admiration for Hitler, whom they saw {{as some kind of}} hero, for taking on the whites of Europe. The best known gang from this period, and also best studied, was the Russians. They were a group of Basotho migrant workers who banded together {{in the absence of any}} effective law enforcement by either mine owners or the state. The primary goal of this gang was to protect members from the tsotsis and from other gangs of migrant workers, and to acquire and defend resources they found desirable - most notably women, jobs and the urban space necessary for the parties and staged fights that formed the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> weekend entertainment.|$|E

5|$|In early 1918, {{after the}} {{capitulation}} of Tsarist Russia the Germans, having moved the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{forces to the}} Western Front, launched the Spring Offensive, striking against the British forces in the Somme. The initial onslaught pushed the Allied forces back and the Australian divisions, which had been merged into the Australian Corps, were thrown into the line {{in an effort to}} stem the tide. In early March, the 11th Battalion moved to the Hollebeke sector, where they were subjected to gas attacks before being sent south to Amiens at the start of April, joining the rest of the 1st Division in defence of Hazebrouck {{in the middle of the}} month. For the next couple of months the battalion rotated through the line in a defensive role as the German offensive was blunted. In June, as the Allies sought to regain some of the initiative, they undertook a series of Peaceful Penetration raids. On 2 June, the 11th Battalion attacked Mont de Merris, which resulted in the capture of a large amount of German equipment and over 200 prisoners for the loss of 16 men killed and 74 wounded. A lesser attack was launched on the German trenches opposite the battalion on 22 June. Around this time, a small group of US soldiers was attached to the 11th Battalion to gain experience. The following month, the battalion captured Gerbedoen Farm before supporting the 10th Battalion's successful attack on Merris.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd New Zealand Division {{had moved}} into the front line in November in order to relieve the 8th Indian Division and would {{take part in the}} advance across the Sangro planned {{for the end of the}} month. The brigade {{subsequently}} occupied positions around Atessa, with the Māori Battalion in brigade reserve, occupying a series of low hills which formed the Sangro river valley. The Eighth Army's forward units had reached the Sangro in early November and General Harold Alexander—commander of the 15th Army Group—had planned for Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery to strike across the river on its coastal plain on 20 November with V Corps. Montgomery shifted the 8th Indian Division to the right in secret to narrow the V Corps front and concentrate its power, bringing the newly arrived 2nd New Zealand Division into the gap. Heavy rain flooded the river, forcing the postponement of the offensive and giving the Germans time to move in reinforcements. In the early hours of 28 November the Eighth Army attack began, supported by heavy artillery concentrations. The New Zealanders advanced steadily, capturing the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> objectives. The Māori Battalion, still in brigade reserve, stood to during the attack but was not required.|$|E
5|$|The diet of oviraptorids {{has been}} {{interpreted}} in various ways since the time Oviraptor was wrongly {{thought to have been}} a predator of eggs. It has been suggested that oviraptorosaurs as a whole were herbivores, which is supported by the gastroliths (stomach stones) found in Caudipteryx, and the wear facets in the teeth of Incisivosaurus. In 2010 Longrich and colleagues found that oviraptorid jaws had features similar to those seen in herbivorous tetrapods (four-limbed animals), especially those of dicynodonts, an extinct group of synapsid stem-mammals. Oviraptorids and dicynodonts share features such as short, deep, and toothless mandibles; elongated dentary symphyses; elongated mandibular fenestrae; and a downwards-projecting bar in the palate. Modern animals with jaws that resemble those of oviraptorids include parrots and tortoises; the latter group also has tooth-like projections on their premaxillae. Longrich and colleagues concluded that due to the similarities between oviraptorids and herbivorous animals, the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> diet would most likely have been formed by plant matter. Oviraptorids are found at high frequencies in the formations they are known from, similar to the pattern seen in dinosaurs that are known to be herbivorous; these animals were more abundant than carnivorous dinosaurs, as more energy was available at their lower trophic level in the food chain. The jaws of oviraptorids may have been specialised for processing food, such as xerophytic vegetation (adapted for environments with little water), that would have grown in their environment, but this is not possible to demonstrate, as {{little is known about the}} flora of the area at the time. A 2013 study by Lü and colleagues found that oviraptorids appear to have retained their hind limb proportions throughout ontogeny (growth), which is also a pattern mainly seen in herbivorous animals.|$|E
