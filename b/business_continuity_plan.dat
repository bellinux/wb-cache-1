40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} {{is based on an}} {{interest}} for strategic information security, and in particular <b>business</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>planning,</b> in combination with own experiences from strategic management of corporations. Information security policy- and education, practice and awareness issues have also been part of my focus. Strategic information security is the part of information security that senior managements (top managements) should own and care for, like for any other strategic area in an organization. One problem is that this is often not the case as the senior management attention and awareness is focused on other areas instead. The work has mainly addressed explanatory models and methodology to explain what strategic information security including <b>business</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>planning</b> is to senior management teams and a training concept. It has also high-lighted challenges from current and future technology, and terminology problems affecting <b>business</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>planning</b> in a direct or indirect way. The purpose of the thesis was broken down into six objectives matching identified knowledge gaps. These resulted in the research question "How to improve the senior management own and care process for strategic information security, and in particular <b>business</b> <b>continuity</b> planning?" The results from the empirical studies are two models and one methodology to be used when targeting strategic information security issues like modeling and implementations of <b>business</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>planning,</b> security policies and security education, practice and awareness during the own and care process. A further result is a training concept for organizational crisis management. In addition, the results also indicate challenges {{that need to be addressed}} during work with security policies and <b>business</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>planning.</b> The thesis further contributes with a framework for <b>business</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>planning</b> guiding how the models and methodology, together with the training concept and challenges should be used together in the own and care process, to resolve problems and achieve organizational change. The contribution is of a general nature and is suitable to use in both private and public sector organizations.

50|$|According to the Business Continuity Institute (BCI), {{disaster}} {{response is}} most suitably incorporated within an overall <b>Business</b> <b>Continuity</b> <b>Plan.</b> The BCI's Good Practice Guidelines (GPG) (BCI, 2013) highlight that crisis or disaster response cannot {{be considered as}} a discreet entity in the case that BCM is employed; {{based on the premise that}} BCM is a holistic approach to any high impact incident.

50|$|When {{a crisis}} will {{undoubtedly}} cause a significant disruption to an organization, a <b>business</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>plan</b> can help minimize the disruption. First, one must identify the critical functions and {{processes that are}} necessary to keep the organization running. This part of the planning should be conducted in the earliest stages, and is part of a business impact analysis phase that will signpost “How much does the organization stand to lose?” (Osborne, A. (2007). Practical Business Continuity Management. Business Management: Top tips for effective, real-world Business Continuity Management).|$|E
50|$|Another {{component}} of business continuity is communications {{in times of}} duress.

In order to avoid some of the potential problems associated with disrupted communication channels, the <b>business</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>plan</b> should include a lead manager who will be in charge of all communications in that area, the cooperation of executives and public relations people, and scheduled exercises to put the plan into practice.|$|E

40|$|Many current <b>business</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>plans</b> {{focus on}} the {{technology}} of an organization, not on the processes. This research investigates how using agile methodology and business process modeling can change the efficiency and effectiveness of <b>business</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>planning.</b> ^ Recent surveys of <b>business</b> <b>continuity</b> planners indicate that testing <b>business</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>plans</b> exposes problems and provides an opportunity to correct and improve them. However, in practice, plans are rarely tested after their creation and happen only after they are completed. Current <b>business</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>planning</b> practice {{is similar to the}} traditional waterfall method of software design and levies a significant drain on an organization’s resources to develop plans. This dissertation explores the use of agile techniques, like designing plans using “test first” design, focusing on the highest value processes first, and developing quality plans with the minimum of effort and error. ^ This dissertation presents an agile methodology that harnesses “test first” development of plans using business process modeling notation (BPMN). It focuses on the continuity of processes, not the causes of a disruption. This methodology allows for a more organic approach to <b>business</b> <b>continuity</b> where IT staff and business process owners collaborate closely and leverage proven agile and test-driven development techniques. The agile techniques allow for a lightweight method of planning that reduces unnecessary work. ^ By using BPMN, a machine executable notation, plans are easier to test by computer. Since BPMN is also graphical, plans developed in BPMN are less ambiguous, less inconsistent, and easier to communicate with others within and outside an organization. ...|$|R
