Disarticulated bones were found, {{in front of the}} lower ischia, identified as belonging to at least two individuals of Confuciusornis sanctus, a basal bird that is very common in the formation. Also a 13.5 centimetres long scapula was discovered, belonging to some 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) long herbivorous ornithischian, perhaps Yueosaurus or a Psittacosaurus species.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Arthritic {{bone loss}} in the joints of {{patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis {{is the result of}} a combination of osteoclastic bone resorption and osteoblastic bone formation. This process is not completely understood, and especially the importance of local inflammation needs further investigation. We evaluated how bone formation and bone resorption are altered in experimental autoimmune arthritis. METHODS: Twenty-one female SKG mice were randomized to either an arthritis group or a control group. Tetracycline was used to identify mineralizing surfaces. After six weeks the right hind paws were embedded undecalcified in methylmethacrylate. The paws were cut exhaustively according to the principles of vertical sectioning and systematic sampling. 3 D design-based methods were used to estimate the total number of osteoclasts, mineralizing surfaces, eroded <b>surfaces,</b> and osteoclast-covered <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In addition the presence of adjacent inflammation was ascertained. RESULTS: The total number of osteoclasts, mineralizing surfaces, eroded surfaces, and osteoclast covered surfaces were elevated in arthritic paws compared to normal paws. Mineralizing surfaces were elevated adjacent to as well as not adjacent to inflammation in arthritic mice compared to normal mice. In arthritic mice, eroded surfaces and osteoclast covered surfaces were larger on <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces</b> adjacent to inflammation than on <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces</b> without adjacent inflammation. However, we found no difference between mineralizing <b>surfaces</b> at <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces</b> with or without inflammation in arthritic mice. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation induced an increase in resorptive <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces</b> as well as formative <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The <b>bone</b> formative response may be more general, since formative <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces</b> were also increased when not associated with inflammation. Thus, the bone loss may be the result of a substantial local bone resorption, which cannot be compensated by the increased local bone formation. These findings may be valuable for the development of new osteoblast targeting drugs in RA...|$|R

In the upper corner of {{the front edge of}} the nasal branch of the maxilla, a kink is present, separating a convex curvature below from a concave curvature above. The descending branch of the postorbital has a U-shaped cross-section. The parietal bones are not visible in side view. The supratemporal fenestra has a straight inner edge. A paraquadratic fenestra is lacking. A well-developed process is present {{on the underside of the}} jugal branch of the ectopterygoid. The rear edge of the jugal branch of the ectopterygoid, in front of the infratemporal fenestra, is deeply grooved. The lower jaw has a large external mandibular fenestra. The foramen mylohyoideum is largely oriented to the front and below. The head of the thighbone is directed to the inside and below. The front underside of the thighbone has a concave surface.

500|$|The sail of Dimetrodon {{is formed}} by {{elongated}} neural spines projecting from the vertebrae. Each spine varies in cross-sectional shape from its base to its tip {{in what is}} known as [...] "dimetrodont" [...] differentiation. Near the vertebra body, the spine cross section is laterally compressed into a rectangular shape, and closer to the tip, it takes on a figure-eight shape as a groove runs along either side of the spine. The figure-eight shape is thought to reinforce the spine, preventing bending and fractures. A cross section of the spine of one specimen of Dimetrodon giganhomogenes is rectangular in shape but preserves figure-eight shaped rings close to its center, indicating that the shape of spines may change as individuals age. The microscopic anatomy of each spine varies from base to tip, indicating where it was embedded in the muscles of the back and where it was exposed as part of a sail. The lower or proximal portion of the spine has a rough surface that would have served as an anchoring point for the epaxial muscles of the back, and also has a network of connective tissues called Sharpey's fibers that indicate it was embedded within the body. Higher up on the distal (outer) portion of the spine, the <b>bone</b> <b>surface</b> is smoother. The periosteum, a layer of tissue surrounding the bone, is covered in small grooves that presumably supported the blood vessels that vascularized the sail.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sulfide mineral framboids {{associated}} with fossil bones in marine settings may aid in taphonomic reconstructions because framboids reflect the geochemical {{conditions under which}} they form. However, the timing and mechanism(s) of framboid formation on bone remain poorly understood. To better constrain the initial formation of framboids during decomposition of bone in marine depositional environments, we simulated aspects of bone decay {{on the ocean floor}} and analyzed framboids found on <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces</b> and in the associated sediment. We observed that framboids formed on <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces</b> within one week of experimentation, and were {{associated with}} reducing conditions within a dark-colored microbial mat overlain by oxic waters. Statistical and discriminant analyses of elemental data show that bone-hosted framboids formed in situ on the <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Close associations of framboids with sulfidic microbial biofilms indicate that bone-hosted framboids resulted from conditions generated during the microbial degradation of bone-associated organic matter. Our results suggest that framboids can form on <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces</b> while <b>bones</b> rest on the seafloor prior to burial and perhaps prior to the so-called sulphophilic stage of whale-fall animal colonization. We compared experimentally produced framboids with published sedimentary framboid populations. Bone-hosted framboids resemble smaller and less variably sized sedimentary framboid populations canonically known to form in anoxic water columns, even though the bone-hosted framboids were overlain by oxygenated conditions. We propose that the period available for framboid growth is shorter on <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces</b> than in sediments, because geochemical conditions that favor sulfide mineral precipitation on bone are transient.

2500|$|Bone {{tissue is}} a hard tissue, a type of dense {{connective}} tissue. [...] It has a honeycomb-like matrix internally, which helps to give the bone rigidity.

40|$|We {{have shown}} that in the osteopetrotic rat {{mutation}} toothless (tl) osteoblasts are absent from older <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces</b> in mutants and that mutant osteoblasts in vivo lack the prominent stress fiber bundles polarized along <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces</b> in osteoblasts from normal littermates. Our recent data demonstrate that in normal osteoblasts in vitro beta- and gamma-actin mRNAs have different, characteristic intracellular distributions and that tl (mutant) osteoblasts fail to differentially sort these mRNAs. Because bone resorption and formation are highly interdependent and injections of CSF- 1, a growth factor, increase bone resorption and growth in tl rats, we {{examined the effects of}} CSF- 1 treatment on osteoblast survival and ultrastructure in vivo and ability to sort actin mRNAs in vitro. Neonatal CSF- 1 treatment of mutants restores osteoblasts on older <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces,</b> normalizes the intracellular distribution of stress fibers in osteoblasts in vivo and promotes normal sorting of beta-actin mRNA in mutant osteoblasts in vitro without normalizing gamma-actin distribution. These data suggest the beta- and gamma-actin mRNAs in osteoblasts are sorted by different mechanisms and that the differential sorting of beta-actin mRNA is related to the characteristic polarization of stress fibers in osteoblasts and their survival on <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces.</b> This experimental system can be used to explore the relationships and regulation of these aspects of cell and tissue biology...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAccurate muscle {{geometry}} for musculoskeletal {{models is}} important to enable accurate subject-specific simulations. Commonly, linear scaling is used to obtain individualised muscle geometry. More advanced methods include non-linear scaling using segmented <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces</b> and manual or semi-automatic digitisation of muscle paths from medical images. In this study, a new scaling method combining non-linear scaling with reconstructions of <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces</b> using statistical shape modelling is presented. Statistical Shape Models (SSMs) of femur and tibia/fibula were used to reconstruct <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces</b> of nine subjects. Reference models were created by morphing manually digitised muscle paths to mean shapes of the SSMs using non-linear transformations and inter-subject variability was calculated. Subject-specific models of muscle attachment and via points were created from three reference models. The accuracy was evaluated by calculating {{the differences between the}} scaled and manually digitised models. The points defining the muscle paths showed large inter-subject variability at the thigh and shank – up to 26 mm; this was found to limit the accuracy of all studied scaling methods. Errors for the subject-specific muscle point reconstructions of the thigh could be decreased by 9 % to 20 % by using the non-linear scaling compared to a typical linear scaling method. We conclude that the proposed non-linear scaling method is more accurate than linear scaling methods. Thus, when combined with the ability to reconstruct <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces</b> from incomplete or scattered geometry data using statistical shape models our proposed method is an alternative to linear scaling methods...|$|R
40|$|Photoacoustic (PA) imaging of {{interphalangeal}} peripheral joints is {{of interest}} in the context of using the synovial membrane as a surrogate marker of rheumatoid arthritis.

Methods: Six patients received 2 intravenous injections of Ra- 223 -dichloride, 6 wk apart, at 100 kBq/kg of whole-body weight. The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution as a function of time were determined, and dosimetry was performed for a range of organs including <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces,</b> red marrow, kidneys, gut, and whole body using scintigraphic imaging; external counting; and blood, fecal, and urine collection. Safety was assessed from adverse events. Results: The injected activity cleared rapidly from blood, with 1. 1 % remaining at 24 h. The main route of excretion was via the gut, although no significant toxicity was reported. Most of the administered activity was taken up rapidly into bone (61 % at 4 h). The range of absorbed doses delivered to the <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces</b> from a emissions was 2, 331 - 13, 118 mGy/MBq. The ranges of absorbed doses delivered to the red marrow were 177 - 994 and 1 - 5 mGy/MBq from activity on the <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces</b> and from activity in the blood, respectively. No activity-limiting toxicity was observed at these levels of administration. The absorbed doses from the second treatment were correlated significantly with the first for a combination of the whole body, <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces,</b> kidneys, and liver. Conclusion: A wide range of interpatient absorbed doses was delivered to normal organs. Intrapatient absorbed doses were significantly correlated between the 2 administrations for any given patient. The lack of gastrointestinal toxicity is likely due to the low absorbed doses delivered to the gut wall from the gut contents. The lack of adverse myelotoxicity implies that the absorbed dose delivered from the circulating activity may be a more relevant guide to the potential for marrow toxicity than that due to activity on the <b>bone</b> <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R
