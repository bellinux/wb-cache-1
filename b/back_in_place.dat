5|$|In July 1984, Raiford guards {{found two}} hacksaw blades hidden in Bundy's cell. A steel bar {{in one of}} its windows had been sawed {{completely}} through at the top and bottom and glued <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> with a homemade soap-based adhesive. Several months later his cell was changed again after guards found an unauthorized mirror hidden in it.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, the chapel was {{extensively}} restored {{with the assistance}} of donations from Lady Norma Dalrymple-Champneys. During this work, the chandelier, given in 1885 by Provost Shadwell while still a Fellow, was put <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> the organ was restored, the painting mounted behind the altar, and the chapel repainted. A list of former chaplains and organ scholars was erected in the ante-chapel. The Chaplain is Rev Dr Robert Tobin and the Senior Organ Scholar for 2010-11 was Edwin Lock. At that time David Maw was appointed Director of Chapel Music.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, the Unitarians were {{challenged}} by Federalist forces. After {{the resignation of}} Rivadavia, Manuel Dorrego was installed as governor of Buenos Aires province. He quickly made peace with Brazil but, on returning to Argentina, was overthrown and executed by the Unitarian general Juan Lavalle, who took Dorrego's place. However, Lavalle did not spend long as governor either: he was soon overthrown by militias composed largely of gauchos led by Rosas and Estanislao L처pez. By the end of 1829 the old legislature that Lavalle had disbanded was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> and had appointed Rosas as governor of Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|The {{auxiliary}} {{system is}} powered via a separate transformer winding feeding three independent {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT) converters each providing a three-phase 400volt system. The locomotive is designed {{with an open}} system architecture that can be adapted later. Diagnostic information is available to the driver and can be sent to the control center via GSM-R. The locomotive has a large and bright cab with space for up to three people. The second series of locomotives have an improved driver's chair, which has been retrofitted on the older trains. The machine room has a center hallway. All high-current equipment is located behind a door which can only be opened with a special key. This key is locked {{in such a way that}} it cannot be accessed without grounding the locomotive, and similarly the locomotive cannot be ungrounded again until the key is <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|Trump {{was granted}} {{permission}} by the City of New York {{to build the}} top 20 stories of the building in exchange for operating the atrium as a city-administered privately owned public space. In {{the lobby of the}} building are two Trump merchandise kiosks (one of which replaced a long public bench) operating out of compliance with city regulations. The city issued a notice of violation in July 2015, demanding the bench be put <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> Although the Trump Organization initially said that the violation was without merit, a lawyer speaking for Trump's organization stated in January 2016 that the kiosks would be removed in two to four weeks, prior to an expected court ruling.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, in week 1 of the season, Robinson had {{his first}} reception. On September 28, Robinson made his first career NFL start against the San Diego Chargers. On October 19 in week 7 of 2014, Robinson made his first start at running <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> of an injured Toby Gerhart. He had an NFL-career-high 127 rushing on 22 carries against the Cleveland Browns to help the 2014 Jacksonville Jaguars end a nine-game losing streak. It was the first 100-yard rushing game for the team for the season and the most rushing yards by a Jaguar in two seasons. He posted career highs in yards and carries and also scored his first NFL touchdown. When Robinson had 108 on 18 carries the {{following}} week against Miami, {{he became the first}} Jaguar to have back-to-back 100-yard games since Maurice Jones-Drew in 2011. On December 7, Robinson endured a foot sprain against the 2014 Houston Texans and he was placed on season-ending injured reserve on December 10. He finished 2014 with 135 carries, 582 yards, and 4 touchdowns.|$|E

5|$|They realise {{that this}} was a trap {{arranged}} by Kovarian, as the Silence begin to escape confinement and overload the eyedrives (including Madame Kovarian's), killing their users. The Doctor and River escape {{to the top of the}} pyramid while Amy and Rory fight off a wave of Silence and Amy realises who Rory is. Madame Kovarian dislodges her own eyedrive as it begins to overload, but Amy forces it <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> with the intention of killing her as revenge for Kovarian taking her child (Melody Pond) away. Amy and Rory regroup with River and the Doctor. River tries to convince the Doctor that this frozen timeline is acceptable and that he does not have to die, but the Doctor explains that all of reality will soon break down. River claims she'll suffer more than anyone else in the universe if she has to kill the Doctor, despite his horror at the idea. To stop it, the Doctor marries River on the spot and whispers something in her ear, declaring that he had just told her his name. He then requests that River allow him to prevent the universe's destruction. The two kiss, and reality begins to return to normal.|$|E

25|$|None of {{the toll}} road {{milestones}} are visible {{because they were}} buried during the Second World War {{to prevent them from}} being used by invading troops, agents, etc. This seems to have happened all over Scotland, however Fife was more fortunate than Ayrshire, for the stones were taken into storage and put <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> after the war had finished. The milestone near Bloomridge Farm and Kirkmuir Farm are likewise missing, presumed buried.|$|E

25|$|Most {{milestones}} are {{no longer}} in-situ and often the only remaining clue is an otherwise unexplained 'kink' {{in the line of}} a hedgerow.

25|$|Until 6 January 1929, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was a {{parliamentary}} monarchy. On that day, King Alexander I abolished the Vidovdan Constitution (adopted in 1921), prorogued the National Assembly and introduced a personal dictatorship (so-called 6 January Dictatorship). He renamed the country Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 3 October 1929, {{and continued to}} rule as a de facto absolute monarch until his assassination on 9 October 1934, during a state visit to France. After his assassination, parliamentary monarchy was put <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{conventional}} surgery performed for glaucoma is the trabeculectomy. Here, a partial thickness flap {{is made in}} the scleral wall of the eye, and a window opening is made under the flap to remove a portion of the trabecular meshwork. The scleral flap is then sutured loosely <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> to allow fluid to flow out of the eye through this opening, resulting in lowered intraocular pressure and the formation of a bleb or fluid bubble {{on the surface of the}} eye.|$|E
