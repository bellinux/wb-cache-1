5000|$|Home appliances: Erotic {{computer}} games Like Life and Monogokoro, Monomusume both feature home appliances as girls. These appliances include washing machines, alarm clocks, <b>blackboard</b> <b>erasers,</b> pillows, first aid boxes, cell phones, and even post boxes, among others.

6000|$|Miss Muzzy was sarcastic, {{and proud}} of it. She was sarcastic to Carl when he gruffly asked why he couldn't study French instead of [...] "all this Latin stuff." [...] If there be any virtue {{in the study of}} Latin (and we have all {{forgotten}} all our Latin except the fact that [...] "suburb" [...] means [...] "under the city"--i. e., a subway), Carl was blinded to it for ever. Miss Muzzy wore eye-glasses and had no bosom. Carl's father used to say approvingly, [...] "Dat Miss Muzzy don't stand for no nonsense," [...] and Mrs. Dr. Rusk often had her for dinner.... Miss McDonald, fat and slow-spoken and kind, prone to use the word [...] "dearie," [...] to read Longfellow, and to have buttons off her shirt-waists, used on Carl a feminine weapon more unfair than the robust sarcasm of Miss Muzzy. For after irritating a self-respecting boy into rudeness by pawing his soul with damp, puffy hands, she would weep. She was a kind, honest, and reverent bovine. Carl sat under her supervision in the junior room, with its hardwood and blackboards and plaster, high windows and portraits of Washington and a President who was either Madison or Monroe (no one ever remembered which). He hated the eternal school smell of drinking-water pails and chalk and slates and varnish; he loathed the <b>blackboard</b> <b>erasers,</b> white with crayon-dust; he found inspiration only in the laboratory where [...] "Prof" [...] Larsen mistaught physics and rebuked questions about the useless part of chemistry--that is, the part that wasn't in their text-books.|$|R

5000|$|She complained {{frequently}} to the principal, a white former teacher named James Leach. [...] "I requested a pointer for my <b>blackboard</b> and an <b>eraser,</b> things {{of this sort}} that I needed as a teacher," [...] she said. This did not endear her to Leach or the district administration. [...] "I was labeled 'hostile' and 'unreasonable.'" [...] At {{the end of the}} year she was informed that her contract would not be renewed. Leach told the superintendent that although she was [...] "a competent teacher" [...] she often had [...] "an insulting and hostile attitude" [...] and made [...] "petty and unreasonable demands." [...] She insisted that she be told why, and in a letter to her the district cited her refusal to administer standardized tests, her refusal to cooperate with the administration and an [...] "antagonistic and hostile attitude ... throughout the school year." ...|$|R
