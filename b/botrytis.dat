5|$|Erysiphe cichoracearum, <b>botrytis</b> blight, pythium root rot, rusts, {{cucumber}} mosaic virus (CMV), {{as well as}} mineral and nutrient deficiencies.|$|E
5|$|Other fungi {{affect the}} {{remainder}} of the plant. Another <b>Botrytis</b> fungus, <b>Botrytis</b> polyblastis (Sclerotinia polyblastis) causes brown spots on the flower buds and stems (narcissus fire), especially in damp weather and is a threat to the cut flower industry. Ramularia vallisumbrosae is a leaf spot fungus found in warmer climates, causing narcissus white mould disease. Peyronellaea curtisii, the Narcissus leaf scorch, also affects the leaves as does its synanamorph, Phoma narcissi (leaf tip blight). Aecidium narcissi causes rust lesions on leaves and stems.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first named as Clavaria <b>botrytis</b> in 1797 by Christian Hendrik Persoon. In 1821, Elias Magnus Fries sanctioned the genus name Clavaria, and treated Ramaria as {{a section of}} Clavaria. It was given its current name in 1918 by Adalbert Ricken. Obsolete {{historical}} synonyms include Gotthold Hahn's 1883 Corallium <b>botrytis</b> and A. A. Pearson's variety Clavaria <b>botrytis</b> var. alba, which is no longer recognized as an independent taxon. Currie Marr and Daniel Stuntz described the variety R.botrytis var. aurantiiramosa in their 1973 monograph of western Washington Ramaria; Edwin Schild and G.Ricci described variety compactospora from Italy in 1998. In 1950, E.J.H. Corner published George F. Atkinson's 1908 Clavaria holorubella as R.botrytis var. holorubella, but this taxon {{is now known as}} the independent species Ramaria holorubella.|$|E
5|$|American {{gooseberry}} mildew and {{powdery mildew}} can infect {{the leaves and}} shoot tips, and <b>botrytis</b> may cause the fruit to rot in a wet season. Currant and gooseberry leaf spot (Drepanopeziza ribis) is another disease of blackcurrants, {{but it is not}} usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance.|$|E
5|$|Extracts of {{the fruit}} body of Ramaria <b>botrytis</b> {{have been shown to}} favorably {{influence}} the growth and development of HeLa cells grown in tissue culture. The mushroom contains nicotianamine, an ACE inhibitor (angiotensin-converting enzyme). Nicotianamine is a metal-chelating compound essential in iron metabolism and utilization in plants. Several sterols have been isolated from the fruit bodies, 5α,6α-epoxy-3β-hydroxy-(22E)-ergosta-8(14),22-dien-7-one, ergosterol peroxide, cerevisterol, and 9α-hydroxycerevisterol, in addition to the previously unknown ceramide (2S,2R,3R,4E,8E)-N-2'-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-2-amino-9-methyl-4,8-heptade-cadiene-1,3-diol.|$|E
5|$|Liliaceae {{are subject}} {{to a wide variety}} of {{diseases}} and pests, including insects, such as thrips, aphids, beetles and flies. Also fungi, viruses and vertebrate animals such as mice and deer. An important horticultural and garden pest is the scarlet lily beetle (Japanese red lily beetle, Lilioceris lilii) and other Lilioceris species which attack Fritillaria and Lilium. Lilium species may be food plants for the Cosmia trapezina moth. A major pest of Tulips is the fungus, <b>Botrytis</b> tulipae.|$|E
5|$|Ramaria <b>botrytis</b> {{is found}} in Africa (Tunisia), Australia, Asia (including the eastern Himalayas of India, Nepal, Japan, Korea, Pakistan, China, the Far East of Russia, and Turkey) and Europe (including the Netherlands, France, Portugal, Italy, Bulgaria, and Spain). It is also present in Mexico and in Guatemala. Widely {{distributed}} in North America, it is most common in the southeast and along the Pacific Coast. The variety R.botrytis var. aurantiiramosa, limited in distribution to Lewis County, Washington, associates with Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Variety compactospora is known from Sardinia, Italy, {{where it has been}} found growing in sandy soil in forests comprising strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), tree heath (Erica arborea), and holm oak (Quercus ilex).|$|E
5|$|Ramaria <b>botrytis</b> was {{designated}} the type species of Ramaria in 1933 by Marinus Anton Donk. Modern molecular analysis indicates that Ramaria is a polyphyletic assemblage of species with clavarioid fruit bodies. According to the infrageneric classification scheme proposed by Marr and Stuntz, R.botrytis {{is included in}} the subgenus Ramaria, which includes species that have grooved spores, clamps present in the hyphae, and fruit bodies with a large, profusely branched cauliflower-like appearance. Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA suggests that R.botrytis is closely related to R.rubripermanens and R.rubrievanescens, and that these species form a clade that is sister (sharing a recent common ancestor) to the false truffle genus Gautieria, the most derived group within the studied taxa.|$|E
5|$|Riesling is {{the second}} leading white grape varietal after the {{indigenous}} Grüner Veltliner. Austrian Riesling is generally thick bodied, coating the palate and producing a strong clarity of flavour coupled with a mouthwatering aroma. A particular Austrian Riesling trademark is a long finish that includes hints of white pepper. It flourishes in the cool climate and free-draining granite and mica soil of the Wachau region where Austrian wine laws allow for irrigation. With levels normally around 13% it has a relatively high alcohol content for Riesling and is generally at its peak after 5 years. Austrian Riesling is not known for its sweetness and is mostly dry with very few grapes affected by <b>botrytis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Neck rot is a {{fungal disease}} {{affecting}} onions in storage. It {{is caused by}} <b>Botrytis</b> allii, which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb, causing a grey mould to develop. The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales. Large quantities of spores are produced and crust-like sclerotia may also develop. In time, a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry, mummified structure. This disease may be present throughout the growing period, but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage. Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting, careful drying and curing of the mature onions, and correct storage in a cool, dry place with plenty of circulating air.|$|E
5|$|Several steroid {{derivatives}} {{have been}} isolated and identified from fruit bodies of L.perlatum, including (S)-23-hydroxylanostrol, ergosterol α-endoperoxide, ergosterol 9,11-dehydroendoperoxide and (23E)-lanosta-8,23-dien-3β,25-diol. The compounds 3-octanone, 1-octen-3-ol, and (Z)-3-octen-1-ol are the predominant {{components of the}} volatile chemicals that give the puffball its odor and flavor. Extracts of the puffball contain relatively high levels of antimicrobial activity against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with an efficiency {{comparable to that of}} the antibiotic ampicillin. These results corroborate an earlier study that additionally reported antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Extracts of the puffball have also been reported to have antifungal activity against Candida albicans, C.tropicalis, Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria solani, <b>Botrytis</b> cinerea, and Verticillium dahliae. A 2009 study found L.perlatum puffballs to contain the phenolic compound cinnamic acid at a concentration of about 14milligrams per kilogram of mushroom. The fruit bodies contain the pigment melanin.|$|E
5|$|The type {{species of}} the genus Ramaria, R.botrytis was first {{described}} scientifically in 1797 by mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. A widely distributed species, it is found in North America, North Africa, central and eastern Europe, Australia, and Asia. The fungus is mycorrhizal with broadleaf trees, and fruits {{on the ground in}} wooded areas. There are several species of coral fungi that are superficially similar in appearance to R.botrytis, and although comparison of habitat or characteristics like color or branching morphology is often sufficient for identification, sometimes microscopy is required to definitively distinguish between them. Fruit bodies of Ramaria <b>botrytis</b> are edible, and young specimens have a mild, fruity taste. Some authors warn of laxative effects in susceptible individuals. The fungus contains several chemical compounds with in vitro biological activity, and fruit bodies have antimicrobial activity against several species and strains of drug-resistant bacteria that cause disease in humans.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ramaria <b>botrytis</b> include its large size, the orange, reddish, or purplish branchlets, striate spores with dimensions averaging 13.8 by 4.7µm, and a weak amyloid staining {{reaction of the}} stem tissue. R.rubripermanens has reddish terminal branches, a stout form, and striate spores, but may be distinguished from R.botrytis by its much shorter spores. Other species with which R.botrytis may be confused include: R.formosa, which has branches that are pinker than R.botrytis, and yellow-tipped; R.caulifloriformis, found in the Great Lakes region of the United States, whose branch tips darken with age; R.strasseri, which has yellow to brown branch tips; R.rubrievanescens, which has branches in which the pink color fades after picking or in mature fruit bodies; and R.botrytoides, which is most reliably distinguished from R.botrytis by its smooth spores. The European species R.rielii, often confused with R.botrytis and sometimes considered synonymous, can be distinguished by microscopic characteristics: R.reilii lacks the clamped hyphae of R.botrytis, its spores are longer and wider, and they have warts instead of striations. The North American species R.araiospora, though superficially similar to R.botrytis, has several distinguishing characteristics: it grows under hemlock; it has reddish to magenta branches with orange to yellowish tips; it lacks any discernible odor; it has warted, somewhat cylindrical spores averaging 9.9 by 3.7µm; and it has non-amyloid stem tissue. Uniformly colored bright pink to reddish, R.subbotrytis has spores measuring 7–9 by 3–3.5µm.|$|E
25|$|Fruity: {{featuring}} the aromas of fruits other than citrus, such as peach, cassis (black currant), mango, passion fruit, and others. A modern example {{here would be}} Ginestet <b>Botrytis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{flowers are}} {{sometimes}} {{affected by a}} grey, fuzzy mold called <b>botrytis.</b> Under humid conditions, it is often found growing on the older flowers. Treatment is to simply remove the old flowers, so the mold does not spread to the new flowers.|$|E
25|$|A common foliar {{disease of}} basil is gray mold caused by <b>Botrytis</b> cinerea; {{it can cause}} infections post-harvest and is capable of killing the entire plant. Black spot {{can be seen on}} basil foliage and is caused by the fungi genus Colletotrichum.|$|E
25|$|The grapevine fungal {{pathogen}} <b>Botrytis</b> cinerea is able {{to oxidise}} resveratrol into metabolites showing attenuated antifungal activities. Those include the resveratrol dimers restrytisol A, B, and C, resveratrol trans-dehydrodimer, leachinol F, and pallidol. The soil bacterium Bacillus cereus {{can be used to}} transform resveratrol into piceid (resveratrol 3-O-beta-D-glucoside).|$|E
25|$|Among the viticultural hazards {{to which}} Chenin is {{susceptible}} (apart from <b>botrytis</b> {{in less than}} ideal conditions) are damage from spring time frost, powdery mildew, and fungal disease (such as Dead arm of grapevine) that affect the wood structures of the grape vine. Some of these hazards can be managed with integrated pest management and rootstock selection.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most Austrian wines which {{follow a}} {{classification}} system similar to Germany (which includes wines labeled based on must weight at harvest such as Spätlese, Auslese, etc.), the Wachau {{has its own}} classification system for quality wine. In favorable vintages, producers may experience <b>botrytis</b> and can produce botrytized wines that carry the same classification as their counterparts in other Austrian wine regions—namely Beerenauslese and Trockenbeerenauslese.|$|E
25|$|Trockenbeerenauslese wines ("dry berries selection") {{are made}} from grapes of an even higher {{potential}} alcohol level, generally reachable only {{with the help of}} <b>Botrytis.</b> The grapes used for Trockenbeerenauslese have reached an even more raisin-like state than those used for Beerenauslese. Due to the high concentration of sugar in the raisin-like grape, these wines can only be made in a sweet style and make extremely sweet, concentrated and usually quite expensive wines.|$|E
25|$|Beerenauslese wines ("berry selection") {{are made}} from grapes that have {{achieved}} minimum defined potential alcohol levels. The concentration of the grape juice may have been facilitated by a fungus <b>Botrytis,</b> which perforates {{the skin of the}} grape forcing water to drip out and all remaining elements to concentrate. Due to the high potential alcohol level required for this category of ripeness, these wines are generally made into sweet wines and can make good dessert wines.|$|E
25|$|For {{most of the}} 21st century, growers {{have been}} working with Greek wine {{authorities}} to produce new virus-free clones of Agiorgitiko that have the potential to resist most grape disease, including <b>botrytis</b> bunch rot, and produce small berries with thicker skins that could ripen to higher sugar levels with most consistent yields. In 2012, several of these new clones were released to Greek wine growers who have slowly begun replanting their Agiorgitiko vineyards.|$|E
25|$|Although insects {{can be a}} problem, by far {{the biggest}} killer of {{carnivorous}} plants (besides human maltreatment) is grey mold (<b>Botrytis</b> cinerea). This thrives under warm, humid conditions and can be a real problem in winter. To some extent, temperate carnivorous plants can be protected from this pathogen by ensuring that they are kept cool and well ventilated in winter and that any dead leaves are removed promptly. If this fails, a fungicide is in order.|$|E
25|$|Merlot {{thrives in}} cold soil, {{particularly}} ferrous clay. The vine tends to bud early which gives it some risk to cold frost and its thinner skin increases its susceptibility to the viticultural hazard of <b>Botrytis</b> bunch rot. If bad weather occurs during flowering, the Merlot vine {{is prone to}} develop coulure. The vine can also be susceptible to downy mildew (though it has better resistance to powdery mildew than other Bordeaux varieties) and to infection by leafhopper insect varieties.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} the wine region tends to dictate what style of Chenin blanc is most {{prevalent}} in the area. In the northernmost reaches of Jasnières, Chenin blanc is at its limits for cultivation with the wines being mostly dry and thin. While most of the Middle Loire experiences a continental climate, the Coteaux du Layon receives more climatic influence from the Atlantic Ocean, which promotes the development of <b>Botrytis</b> cinerea, than in nearby Vouvray or Montlouis. While all three AOCs produce sweet, botrytized wine there tends to be less vintage variation in the Coteaux du Layon. The cool continental influence in Montlouis and Vouvray lends itself to producing {{a wide range of}} Chenin blanc including grapes with the necessary balance of acidity to sugar needed to produce sparkling wine. In the AOC of Savennières, there is less fog and mist from the nearby rivers and more wind that makes it difficult for <b>botrytis</b> to take root. This {{is part of the reason}} why Savennières is the one Loire AOC that produces predominately dry Chenin blanc. In the south of France, the warm Mediterranean {{climate of the}} Languedoc region encourages the production of much more dry styles of Chenin blanc rather than sweet.|$|E
25|$|The {{two major}} grape {{varieties}} of the Anjou are Chenin blanc, {{known locally as}} Pineau de la Loire, which is used for dry, sweet, still and sparkling wine and Cabernet Franc which is used mostly for rosé and still red wines. The sweet wine production of Anjou is highly dependent on favorable climate conditions and experiences marked vintage variation from year to year. The character of the vintage and climate will ultimately determine what type of wine will be produced. Many of the vineyards in the Coteaux du Layon, Bonnezeaux, Quarts de Chaume and Coteaux de l'Aubance AOCs are located on sheltered slopes along tributaries of the Loire. In favorable vintages, the late summer and early fall months will bring climate conditions that encourage moisture and mist {{in the morning and}} enough sunshine in the afternoon to promote the development of favorable <b>Botrytis</b> cinerea rot instead of less desirable forms of grape rot. In exceptional years where there is enough warmth and dry weather during the harvest months, the grapes will be left on the vine to raisin in a process known as passerille. This method desiccates the wine, removing moisture and concentrating sugars, without adding the nuance of flavor that <b>Botrytis</b> does.|$|E
25|$|Eiswein (ice wine) wine is made grapes that freeze {{naturally}} on {{the vine}} and have to reach the same potential alcohol level as Beerenauslese. The grapes are harvested and pressed in the frozen state. The ice stays in the press during pressing and hence a concentrated juice flows off the press leading to higher potential alcohol levels, which in turn generally result in sweet wines due to the high potential alcohol. The taste differs from the other high-level wines since <b>Botrytis</b> infection is usually lower, ideally completely absent.|$|E
25|$|Wines {{produced}} {{in the region of}} Barsac, such as Premiers Crus Château Climens and Château Coutet are allowed to be labeled either with the commune name or with Sauternes. The intense sweetness {{is the result of the}} grapes being affected by <b>Botrytis</b> cinerea, a fungus that is commonly known as noble rot. In the autumn, the Ciron river produces mist that descends upon the area and persists until after dawn. These conditions are conducive to the growth of the fungus which desiccates the grape and concentrates the sugars inside. The three main grapes of this area are Sémillon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle.|$|E
25|$|The grape is a late budding and {{ripening}} {{variety that}} {{is prone to}} produce high yields if not kept in check by winter pruning or green harvesting. In addition to its susceptibility to numerous grapevine viruses, Agiorgitiko is also very sensitive to fungal infection from <b>botrytis</b> bunch rot, downy and powdery mildew. The vine also responds adversely to water stress which may require some irrigation in regions where the practice is permitted. In order to limit yields, Agiorgitiko is often densely planted in poor vineyard soils but growers need {{to be mindful of}} the variety's sensitivity to potassium deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Carginan's {{tendency}} to produce short shoots with clusters that grow {{closely to the}} trunk of the vine means that it is difficult variety to harvest mechanically. However, the economy of scale for blending varieties or grapes destined for lower priced box and jug wines often do not work well with the expense and labor cost of hand-harvesting. Among the viticultural hazards that Carignan is susceptible to include powdery mildew and infestation of the vine from grape worms and the European Grapevine Moth. The vine has some slight resistance to the fungal disease of <b>botrytis</b> bunch rot, downy mildew, and phomopsis.|$|E
25|$|Pedro Ximénez is a {{mid to late}} {{ripening}} grape {{variety that}} also tends to bud at {{the midpoint of the}} budding period of the vine growing season. The vine can be very vigorous and productive, producing large clusters of berries of irregular sizes (occasionally the result of millerandage). Despite having thin skinned berries, Pedro Ximénez is highly susceptible to the viticultural hazard of <b>botrytis</b> bunch rot as well as downy mildew, esca and eutypa dieback. The vine has some resistance to the fungal disease powdery mildew but is also very prone to damage caused by termite infection.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} YAN that winemakers {{will see in}} their grape musts depends {{on a number of}} {{components}} including grape variety, rootstock, vineyard soils and viticultural practices (such as the use of fertilizers and canopy management) as well as the climate conditions of particular vintages. Infections by mold, such as <b>Botrytis</b> cinerea (known as noble rot when it is desired) can reduce the amino acid content of grape must by as much as 61%. Some regions are noted for having low YAN such as Washington State which during a typical vintage will have 90% of tested must below 400mg N/L and nearly a quarter be below 150mg N/L.|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{responsible}} for bunch rot of grape berries are filamentous fungi, {{the most common}} of these being <b>Botrytis</b> cinerea (gray mold) However, there are a range of other fungi {{responsible for}} the rotting of grapes such as Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp., and fungi found in subtropical climates (e.g., Colletotrichum spp. (ripe rot) and Greeneria uvicola (bitter rot)). A further group more commonly associated with diseases of the vegetative tissues of the vine can also infect grape berries (e.g., Botryosphaeriaceae, Phomopsis viticola). Compounds found in bunch rot affected grapes and wine are typically described as having mushroom, earthy odors and include geosmin, 2-methylisoborneol, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-octen-1-ol, fenchol and fenchone.|$|E
25|$|Slugs and snails {{are serious}} pests {{in some parts}} of the world, {{particularly}} in spring when new growth is emerging through the soil. Earwigs can also disfigure the blooms. The other main pests likely to be encountered are aphids (usually on young stems and immature flower buds), red spider mite (causing foliage mottling and discolouration, worse in hot and dry conditions) and capsid bugs (resulting in contortion and holes at growing tips). Diseases affecting dahlias include powdery mildew, grey mould (<b>Botrytis</b> cinerea), verticillium wilt, dahlia smut (Entyloma calendulae f. dahliae), phytophthora and some plant viruses. Dahlias are a source of food for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including angle shades, common swift, ghost moth and large yellow underwing.|$|E
25|$|The Loire river has a {{significant}} effect on the mesoclimate of the region, adding the necessary extra few degrees of temperature that allows grapes to grow when the areas to the north and south of the Loire Valley have shown to be unfavourable to viticulture. In addition to finding vineyards along the Loire, several of the river's tributaries are also well planted—including the Allier, Cher, Indre, Loir, Sèvre Nantaise and Vienne Rivers. The climate can be very cool with spring time frost being a potential hazard for the vines. During the harvest months rain can cause the grapes to be harvested under ripe but can also aid in the development of <b>Botrytis</b> cinerea for the region's dessert wines.|$|E
25|$|Geosmin is a {{compound}} {{with a very}} distinct earthy, musty, beetroot, even turnip flavour and aroma and has an extremely low sensory threshold of down to 10 parts per trillion. Its presence in wine is usually derived as metabolite from the growth of filamentous actinomycetes such as Streptomyces, and moulds such as <b>Botrytis</b> cinerea and Penicillium expansum, on grapes. Wines affected by but not attributed to geosmins are often thought to have earthy properties due to terroir. The geosmin fault occurs worldwide and {{has been found in}} recent vintages of red wines from Beaujolais, Bordeaux, Burgundy and the Loire in France. Geosmin is also thought to be a contributing factor in cork taint.|$|E
