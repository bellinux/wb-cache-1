5000|$|At {{that time}} children's albums {{comprised}} nursery rhymes, which were sung and {{played in a}} simple traditional style. Combe recalled, [...] "record companies used to think anyone could write songs for children, anything was good enough. You would get whole albums where the only accompaniment was acoustic guitar." [...] Combe introduced new concepts in children's songs, writing to appeal to children and their parents: they were funny and relevant. He arranged them with contemporary instrumentation, using his Music Time experience to introduce children to different musical concepts, genres and instruments. Combe started performing concerts in schools - about 200 school shows a year over three years. His next cassette, More Songs for Little Kids (1985), was soon renamed as Spaghetti <b>Bolognaise</b> after its lead track.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1970s, Stomann {{took over}} from Tony Oliver as {{illustrator}} of the children's songbooks published annually by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to accompany a radio series {{used as a}} teaching aid in primary schools. Stomann illustrated all of the editions of this songbook between 1976 and 1986 (except for two 1982 editions, both illustrated by Bob Graham) in the distinctive and colourful style that became his trademark. Around 1980, he began to regularly contribute cartoons and illustrations to the Australian Women's Weekly. Although {{best known for his}} children's book illustrations (notably the long-running Selby series, published {{for more than two decades}} from 1985), Stomann has also, since the early 1980s, contributed artwork to humorous or instructional books for adults. He has also designed sleeves for LP records by popular children's entertainer Peter Combe, including Toffee Apple (1987) and Spaghetti <b>Bolognaise</b> (1988).|$|E
5000|$|The Bichon Frise {{is often}} {{depicted}} as a French dog. Although the bichon breed is originally Spanish, used as sailing dogs, but when the French took over this gentle breed became a lap dog species The Bichons were divided into four categories: the Bichon Maltese, the Bichon <b>Bolognaise,</b> the Bichon Havanese and the Bichon Tenerife (this breed). All originated in the Mediterranean area.Because of their merry disposition, they traveled much and were often used as barter by sailors as they moved from continent to continent. The dogs found early success in Spain and it is generally believed that Spanish seamen introduced the breed to the Canary Island of Tenerife. In the 14th century, Italian sailors rediscovered the little dogs on their voyages and are credited with returning them to the continent, where they became great favorites of Italian nobility. Often, as was {{the style of the}} day with dogs in the courts, they were cut [...] "lion style," [...] like a modern-day Portuguese Water Dog.|$|E
5000|$|MTV {{supported}} a contest {{and a special}} program entitled mtvTREATMENT in which the winner was chosen to direct the video for [...] "Alone I Break." [...] It {{was shot in the}} form of a reality TV show where Jonathan Davis kills members of the band. The video starts with the band performing in the downstairs foyer. Part way through the song, Jonathan turns towards Munky and acts aggressively towards him. This then leads to a short scuffle between the two, as Fieldy proceeds to break up the fight. Jonathan then storms out, and is seen throwing things around in his room, apparently enraged. Meanwhile, Munky takes a bath but soon falls asleep, as Jonathan finds a lamp nearby and pushes it into the tub, instantly electrocuting and killing Munky. Head is then seen looking around as the lights flicker on and off, implying that it this is happening while Munky is being killed. He then proceeds to the balcony as he speaks to someone on his cell phone, unaware that Jonathan is approaching. He pushes Head off the ledge, killing him. He then tosses his cell phone over as well. Later, David is sleeping with two women, as Jonathan creeps in with a pillow, suffocating him then quietly leaving. He moves downstairs where Fieldy is cooking Spaghetti <b>Bolognaise</b> in the kitchen. Jonathan takes out a bottle of rat poison from a cupboard and waits. Fieldy goes into the pantry to fetch some more ingredients, as Jonathan pours rat poison in the sauce. Fieldy serves himself, takes one bite, then dies. Jonathan, apparently pleased with himself, walks outside and proceeds toward the cameraman, as he falls to the floor. This implies that Jonathan killed him, too. All of this takes place throughout the night, implied by the band performing in the evening, Munky and Head dying at night, David being killed in the early hours of the morning, and Fieldy dying at the break of dawn. Jonathan also leaves and kills the cameraman in the morning.|$|E

40|$|Meat/meat {{alternatives}} (M/MA) are key {{sources of}} Fe, Zn and protein, but intake {{tends to be}} low in young children. Australian recommendations state that Fe-rich foods, including M/MA, {{should be the first}} complementary foods offered to infants. The present paper reports M/MA consumption of Australian infants and toddlers, compares intake with guidelines, and suggests strategies to enhance adherence to those guidelines. Mother–infant dyads recruited as part of the NOURISH and South Australian Infants Dietary Intake studies provided 3 d of intake data at three time points: Time 1 (T 1) (n 482, mean age 5 · 5 (SD 1 · 1) months), Time 2 (T 2) (n 600, mean age 14 · 0 (SD 1 · 2) months) and Time 3 (T 3) (n 533, mean age 24 (SD 0 · 7) months). Of 170 infants consuming solids and aged greater than 6 months at T 1, 50 (29 %) consumed beef, lamb, veal (BLV) or pork on at least one of 3 d. Commercial infant foods containing BLV or poultry were {{the most common form of}} M/MA consumed at T 1, whilst by T 2 BLV mixed dishes (including pasta <b>bolognaise)</b> became more popular and remained so at T 3. The processed M/MA increased in popularity over time, led by pork (including ham). The present study shows that M/MA are not being eaten by Australian infants or toddlers regularly enough; or in adequate quantities to meet recommendations; and that the form in which these foods are eaten can lead to smaller M/MA serve sizes and greater Na intake. Parents should be encouraged to offer M/MA in a recognisable form, as one of the first complementary foods, in order to increase acceptance at a later age...|$|E
