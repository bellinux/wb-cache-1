5|$|Platinum is a {{precious}} metal commodity; its <b>bullion</b> has the ISO currency code of XPT. Coins, bars, and ingots are traded or collected. Platinum finds use in jewellery, usually as a 90–95% alloy, {{due to its}} inertness. It is {{used for this purpose}} for its prestige and inherent <b>bullion</b> value. Jewellery trade publications advise jewellers to present minute surface scratches (which they term patina) as a desirable feature in attempt to enhance value of platinum products.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{early in}} 1893, {{a number of}} {{industrial}} firms, including the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and the National Cordage Company went bankrupt. The resulting bank runs and failures {{became known as the}} Panic of 1893. In June of that year, President Grover Cleveland, who believed that the Panic was caused by the inflation generated by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, called a special session of Congress in order to repeal it. The act was repealed on November 1, 1893. On June 13, 1898, Congress ordered the coining of all the remaining <b>bullion</b> purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act into silver dollars. Silver dollar production rose again, until the <b>bullion</b> was exhausted in 1904, when it ceased.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of gold in California, {{a large amount of}} gold coins began appearing in American commercial channels. The influx caused the price of gold relative to silver to decrease, making silver coins worth more as <b>bullion</b> than as currency. They were exported abroad, or else melted locally for their <b>bullion</b> value. As it was profitable to export silver, little was presented at the Mint, which resulted in low mintage numbers for the silver dollar; 1,300 and 1,100 were struck in 1851 and 1852 respectively. The rarity of these dates was recognized by the late 1850s; Mint employees made surreptitious restrikes to sell to collectors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nearly}} three decades since passage of the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, the annual demand for silver <b>bullion</b> rose {{steadily}} from roughly 11 million ounces (1933) to 110 million ounces (1962). The Acts of 1939 and 1946 established floor prices for silver of 71 cents and 90.5 cents (respectively) per ounce. Predicated by an anticipated shortage of silver <b>bullion,</b> Public Law 88-36 (PL88-36) was enacted on 4 June 1963 which repealed the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, and the Acts of 6 July 1939 and 31 July 1946, while providing specific instruction regarding the disposition of silver held as reserves against issued certificates and the price at which silver may be sold. It also amended the Federal Reserve Act to authorize the issue of lower denomination notes (i.e., $1 and $2), allowing for the gradual retirement (or swapping out process) of $1 silver certificates and releasing silver <b>bullion</b> from reserve. In repealing the earlier laws, PL88-36 also repealed {{the authority of the}} Secretary of the Treasury to control the issue of silver certificates. By issuing Executive Order 11110, President John F. Kennedy was able to continue the Secretary’s authority. While retaining their status as legal tender, the silver certificate had effectively been retired from use.|$|E

5|$|The {{possible}} {{reasons for the}} clipping of coins are controversial.

5|$|Confederate minting {{operations}} continued from April 1 {{until the}} <b>bullion</b> ran {{out later that}} month. The staff remained on duty until May 31, 1861.

5|$|Eckfeldt {{served a}} quarter century as chief coiner, during which time the Philadelphia Mint moved to new premises.

5|$|In 1874, trade dollars began {{appearing}} in American commerce. In early 1875, Congress passed the Specie Redemption Act, allowing the Treasury {{to pay out}} silver coins in exchange for paper currency. That act, combined with {{a drop in the}} price of silver, caused hoarded or exported silver coins to reappear in commerce within the United States. Many trade dollars were reimported, especially to California. After the value of silver began to decline and the intrinsic value of the coins fell below one dollar, <b>bullion</b> depositors began having their silver struck as trade dollars and selling them wholesale to be distributed throughout the country. <b>Bullion</b> producers opted to coin their silver into trade dollars because the Coinage Act of 1873 specified that silver brought to the Mint could only be struck as such or cast into bars.|$|E

5|$|In {{this process}} lead <b>bullion</b> and slag is {{obtained}} directly from lead concentrates. The lead sulfide concentrate is melted in a furnace and oxidized, forming lead monoxide.

5|$|Searches for the lode veins on both creeks {{succeeded by}} the 1870s and {{eventually}} led to significant lode mining at the Eva May, Uncle Sam, Grey Eagle, Hattie Ferguson, and Comet mines in the Cataract Creek district and the <b>Bullion,</b> Hope, and Katy mines in the Basin Creek district. By 1880, the settlement at Basin became the local source of supplies for mines and miners.|$|E

A final change reduced the total value in dimes to $25,000 (250,000 coins) while increasing the value in half dollars to $350,000 (700,000 coins).|$|E
