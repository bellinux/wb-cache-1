500|$|Otto Everett Graham Jr. (December 6, 1921 – December 17, 2003) was an American {{football}} {{quarterback who}} played for the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and National Football League (NFL). Graham is regarded by critics {{as one of the}} most dominant players of his era, having taken the Browns to league championship games every year between 1946 and 1955, winning seven of them. With Graham at quarterback, the Browns posted a record of 114 wins, 20 losses, and four ties, including a 9–3 win–loss record in the playoffs. While most of Graham's statistical records have been surpassed in the modern era, he still holds the NFL record for career average yards gained per pass attempt, with 8.98. He also holds the record for the highest career winning percentage for an NFL starting quarterback, at 0.814. Long-time New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, a friend of Graham's, once called him [...] "as great of a quarterback as there ever was." [...] He is also known for being one of only two people (the other <b>being</b> <b>Gene</b> Conley) to win championships in two of the four major North American sports—1946 NBL (became NBA) and AAFC championship, plus three more AAFC and three NFL championships.|$|E

50|$|In 1988, Hoskins played private {{investigator}} Eddie Valiant in the Disney, Touchstone, and Amblin Entertainment live-action/animated family blockbuster, Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). Hoskins {{was not the}} first choice for the role; Harrison Ford, Bill Murray, and Eddie Murphy were all considered for the part, but film critics agreed that Hoskins was perfect for the role, the most prominent among them <b>being</b> <b>Gene</b> Siskel and Roger Ebert. As Hoskins' character interacts and makes physical contact with animated characters in the film, Hoskins was required to take mime training courses in preparation, and after shooting ended, he suffered from hallucinations for months afterward. Hoskins was nominated for a Golden Globe award for this performance and won a British Evening Standard award.|$|E

In 1933, Scola and Markey wrote the screenplay for Baby Face, starring Barbara Stanwyck, which underwent various revisions due to Production Code regulations and was rereleased in a Post-Code edition. Scola and Markey also worked together on the 1933 film Female, which dealt with themes of sexual harassment. During the same year, Scola and Markey collaborated on the screenplay for the controversial Pre-Code film Midnight Mary, initially titled 'Nora' and first written by Anita Loos, which engaged with subject matter relating to the Spanish Civil War.

A typical example is non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which is one type of unsupervised learning, having been successfully applied {{to a variety of}} data including documents, images and gene expression, where their values are usually non-negative. We propose a new model of NMF which is trained by using auxiliary information of overlapping groups. This setting is very reasonable in many applications, a typical example <b>being</b> <b>gene</b> function estimation where functional gene groups are heavily overlapped with each other. To estimate true groups from given overlapping groups efficiently, our model incorporates latent matrices with the regularization term using a mixed norm. This regularization term allows group-wise sparsity on the optimized low-rank structure. The latent matrices and other parameters are efficiently estimated by a block coordinate gradient descent method. We empirically evaluated the performance of our proposed model and algorithm from a variety of viewpoints, comparing with four methods including MMF for auxiliary graph information, by using both synthetic and real world document and gene expression data sets...|$|E

40|$|The {{availability}} of unique variable (V H), diversity (D), and joining (J H) gene segments in the vertebrate germline determines {{the extent to}} which a primary immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire can be generated through combinatorial rearrangement. Although bovine D segments possess unusual properties, the diversity of the primary Ig heavy chain (IgH) repertoire in cattle is restricted by the dominance of a single family of germline V H genes of limited number and diversity. Cattle therefore must employ other diversification strategies in order to generate a functional IgH repertoire, the main candidates <b>being</b> <b>gene</b> conversion and somatic hypermutation. In considering these possibilities, we predicted that if somatic hypermutation was active during B lymphocyte development, the process would introduce nucleotide substitutions to the VDJ exon and also non-coding region lying downstream of the rearranged J H segment. In contrast, our expectation was that gene conversion would show a greater tendency to confine modification to the IgH coding sequence, leaving intron regions substantially unmodified. An analysis of rearranged IgH sequences from cattle of different ages revealed that the diversification of germline sequences could be observed in very young calves and that substitution frequency increased with age. The age-dependent accumulation of mutations was particularly apparent in the second IgH complementarity-determining region (CDR 2). Single base substitutions were found to predominate, with purines targeted more frequently than pyrimidines and transitions favoured over transversions. In non-coding regions, mutations were detected at a normalised frequency that was indistinguishable from that observed in CDR 2. These data are consistent with a process of IgH diversification driven predominantly by somatic hypermutatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{aggregation}} of microarray datasets {{originating from}} different studies {{is still a}} difficult open problem. Currently, best results are generally obtained by the so-called meta-analysis approach, which aggregates results from individual datasets, instead of analyzing aggre-gated datasets. In order to tackle such aggregation problems, {{it is necessary to}} correct for interstudy variability prior to aggregation. The goal {{of this paper is to}} present a new approach for microarray datasets merging, based upon explicit modeling of interstudy variability and gene variability. We develop and demonstrate a new algorithm for microarray datasets merging. The underlying model assumes normally distributed intrinsic gene expressions, distorted by a study-dependent nonlinear transformation, and study dependent (normally distributed) observation noise. The algorithm addresses both parameter estimation (the parameters <b>being</b> <b>gene</b> expression means and variances, observation noise variances and the nonlinear transformations) and data adjustment, and yields as a result adjusted datasets suitable for aggregation. The method is validated on two case studies. The first one concerns E. Coli expression data, artificially distorted by given nonlinear transformations and additive observation noise. The proposed method is able to correct for the distortion, and yields adjusted datasets from which the relevant biological effects can be recovered, as shown by a standard differential analysis. The second case study concerns the aggregation of two real prostate cancer datasets. After adjustment using the proposed algorithm, a differential analysis performed on adjusted datasets yields a larger number of differentially expressed genes (between control and tumor data). The proposed method has been implemented using the statistical software R 1, and Bioconductor packages 2. The source code (valid for merging two datasets), as well as the datasets used for the validation, and some complementary results, are made available on the web sit...|$|E
