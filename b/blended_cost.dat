40|$|Abstract. Biodegradable {{polymers}} represent one of {{the most}} significant area of research today. Among these polymers, poly (b-hydroxy butyrate co b ¢-hydroxy valerate) i. e. PHBV have received special attention because of their unique combination of properties. They are perfectly biocompatible, biodegradable polymers and can be processed by any conventional technique. In the present study an attempt has been made to develop the bio-degradable blends of PHBV by blending them with ethyl cellulose (EC). Ethyl cellulose has been selected to monitor the biodegradation rate of PHBV and also for making the <b>blends</b> <b>cost</b> effective. The <b>blends</b> are thoroughly characterized for their compatibility, by the measurement of viscosity of blends and through FT-IR. Various applications of PHBV/EC blend in agriculture and pharmaceutical industries are being explored...|$|R

40|$|FHB and DON present {{significant}} {{challenges to}} producers, grain elevators, and the brewing industry. Yield reductions and price discounts incurred by producers in North Dakota, Minnesota, and South Dakota averaged about $ 45. 3 million annually {{during the years}} 1998 through 2000. Losses are more substantial when secondary economic impacts are considered. For every $ 1 of scab losses incurred by the producer, $ 2 in losses are incurred {{in other areas of}} rural and state economies. One way of mitigating these losses is to blend barley with DON and barley without DON. Results from the grain blending model show a sharp decline of DON discounts and losses after blending. The average discount fell from $ 0. 57 /bu to $ 0. 17 /bu in 1998, $ 0. 48 /bu to $ 0. 14 /bu in 1999, and $ 0. 38 /bu to $ 0. 15 /bu in 2000. However, producers may not benefit from blending margins (gains from improved quality less <b>blending</b> <b>costs)</b> because these margins are the primary source of revenue for grain elevators. It {{should also be noted that}} the aggregate costs of DON to grain handlers are difficult to estimate because DON is subject to an unusual amount of measurement uncertainty, and penalties for excess DON pose an unusual level of risk.

40|$|A brief {{discussion}} of the current views on fair value accounting is followed by reviewing the concerns raised by the critics. These concerns are related to (a) reliability and verifiability of the underlying assumptions {{in the case of}} mark to model, and (b) the recognition of large losses when prices decline. My concerns about fair value accounting rest on three different issues: (1) the potential for redistribution of capital as dividends when cash dividends exceed realized earnings; (2) reporting failure as success, and success as a failure when increasing credit risk of debtors allows them to recognize gains and vice versa, and (3) increasing information asymmetry when combining realized and unrealized gains and losses as well as failing to disclose the drivers of holding gains and losses. These problems with fair value accounting do not necessarily mean that we should abandon fair value accounting. Instead, the proposal is made to produce two sets of financial statements: one based on historical cost and the other based on fair value. Each type serves a different purpose. Mixing and <b>blending</b> historical <b>costs</b> and fair values is problematic in that it worsens transparency and enhances information asymmetry...|$|R

One approach to solving this heterogeneous distributed database problem {{is based on}} mediator architectures. In these architectures, mediators accept queries from users, process them with respect to wrappers, and return answers. Wrapper provide access to underlying data sources. To efficiently process queries, the mediator must optimize the plan used for processing the query. In classical databases, cost-estimate based query optimization is an effective method for optimization. In a heterogeneous distributed databases, cost-estimate based query optimization is difficult to achieve because the underlying data sources do not export cost information. This paper describes a new method that permits the wrapper programmer to export cost estimates (cost estimate formulas and statistics). For the wrapper programmer to describe all cost estimates may be impossible {{due to lack of}} information or burdensome due to the amount of information. We ease this responsibility of the wrapper programmer by leveraging the generic cost model of the mediator with specific cost estimates from the wrappers. This paper describes the mediator architecture, the language for specifying cost estimates, the algorithm for the <b>blending</b> of <b>cost</b> estimates during query optimization, and experimental results based on a combination of analytical formulas and real measurements of an object database system...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWoody biomass is {{densified}} in {{the form}} of pellets in order to improve its physical and mechanical properties during handling and storage. However, limited research work has been conducted on the mechanical properties of pellets made from agricultural and wood biomass blends. Two commonly available forestry biomass, spruce (S) and pine (P), and three agricultural biomasses, reed canary grass (RCG), timothy hay (H) and switchgrass (SW), were used to form pellets. The mechanical properties were evaluated for three different particle sizes (150 - 300, 300 - 425 and 425 - 600 μm). An Instron attached with an in-house built single unit pelletizer and temperature controlled die was employed to produce a pellet. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of particle size and blending (agricultural and woody biomass) on the mechanical properties (density and intrinsic yield stress). For all biomasses, pellets made from lower particle size (150 - 300 μm) exhibited higher density (950 - 1178 kg/m 3 for spruce and pine; 668 - 800 kg/m 3 for RCG, H and SW; 900 - 970 kg/m 3 for blended biomass). The intrinsic yield stress exhibited differences in values for individual forestry (40 MPa) and agricultural biomass (27 - 48 MPa), however after blending the values converged closest to that value for forestry biomass. In conclusion, <b>blending</b> low <b>cost</b> and abundant available agricultural biomass with woody biomass could not only result in better mechanical properties but would also help to meet the pellet market demand in future...|$|R

40|$|As an {{alternative}} transportation fuel to petrodiesel, biodiesel {{has been widely}} promoted within national energy portfolio targets across the world. Early estimations of low lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of biodiesel {{were one of the}} main drivers behind extensive government support in the form of financial incentives for the industry. However, several recent studies have reported a high degree of uncertainty and variation (U&V) in these emissions, raising questions concerning the carbon benefits of biodiesel compared to petrodiesel. A smaller degree of U&V in physical feedstock characteristics emerging from compositional variation was already known to producers. Although feedstock blending has been broadly practiced by the industry to meet multiple fuel quality standards and to control costs, its implications on these U&V characteristics of biodiesel have not been explicitly addressed by researchers or policymakers. This work investigates the impact of feedstock blending on the U&V characteristics of biodiesel by using a chance-constrained (CC) blend optimization method. The objective of the optimization is minimization of feedstock costs subject to fuel standards and the decision variables are feedstock proportions. Two sets of prediction models are developed to represent the physical properties and lifecycle emissions of feedstocks within the CC model. The results indicate that blending can be used to manage U&V characteristics of biodiesel, and to achieve cost reductions through feedstock diversification. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that emission control policies which restrict the use of certain feedstocks based on their GHG estimates, overlook blending practices and benefits, lowering the quality and increasing the cost of biodiesel. In contrast, emission control policies which recognize the multi-feedstock nature of biodiesel, provides producers with feedstock selection flexibility, and enables them to manage their <b>blend</b> portfolios <b>cost</b> effectively without compromising fuel quality or emissions reductions. by Ece Gülșen.

A refinery simulation of production emission was utilized, and combined with vehicle fuel consumption modeling to determine the lifecycle CO 2 emissions associated with ethanol-blended gasoline in turbocharged engines.

The lowest-emitting blended fuel had an ethanol content of 32  vol%, RON of 105, and octane sensitivity of 15. 5; resulting in a CO 2 reduction of 7. 1 %, compared to the reference gasoline fuel and engine technology. The advantage of ethanol addition is greatest on a per unit basis at low concentrations. Finally, this study shows that engine-downsizing technology can yield an additional CO 2 reduction of up to 25. 5 % in a two-stage downsized turbocharged engine burning the optimum sugarcane-based fuel <b>blend.</b> The social <b>cost</b> savings in the USA, from the CO 2 reduction, is estimated to be as much as $ 187  billion/year. © 2016 Elsevier Lt...|$|R
