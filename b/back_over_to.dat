5|$|As well as passengers, Nairana {{regularly}} carried cargo, including gold bullion, {{and live}} {{animals such as}} horses and cattle between Tasmania and the mainland. A Tasmanian devil being transported to Melbourne Zoo in a wooden crate placed {{in one of the}} ship's four horse stalls escaped by chewing a hole through its box, and was never seen again. In 1934, her code letters were changed to VJGY. Nairana was withdrawn from service in December 1935 {{as a result of a}} ship workers' strike, returning to the Bass Strait run in the new year. As she neared Port Phillip Bay on 12 April 1936, on a clear day with apparently calm seas, she was again struck by a rogue wave and rolled onto her port side before swinging <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> starboard and eventually righting. The impact injured most of her 88 passengers and killed four, including a family of three who disappeared after being swept overboard. Despite this, she proceeded to her berth in the Yarra River, having sustained only minor damage.|$|E
5|$|Frederick William {{decided that}} he could gain little by {{continuing}} to battle the unexpectedly successful French forces, {{and that there were}} easier pickings for his army in the Kingdom of Poland. Accordingly, he stopped armed hostilities with the Republic and turned the state prisoners <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> his erstwhile coalition partner, the Habsburg Austrian monarch FrancisII, Holy Roman Emperor. Lafayette and his companions were initially sent to Neisse (today Nysa, Poland) in Silesia. On 17 May 1794, they were taken across the Austrian border, where a military unit was waiting to receive them. The next day, the Austrians delivered their captives to a barracks-prison, formerly a college of the Jesuits, in the fortress-city of Olmütz, Moravia (today Olomouc in the Czech Republic).|$|E
5|$|In Congress, the {{influential}} senator and losing presidential candidate Rui Barbosa championed the rebels' cause. Barbosa used the navy official's rhetoric {{against them in}} arguing for a diplomatic solution, noting that if the new dreadnoughts were as unsinkable as they claimed, the remaining warships in government hands would certainly {{not be able to}} force a military victory. Furthermore, he argued, if such an attack had the support of Congress and failed, any resulting destruction of Rio de Janeiro would be held at fault. These arguments won Barbosa much support in the Senate, {{so much so that the}} body began working on an amnesty that would absolve the mutineers of all criminal charges once the ships were turned <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the government. After hours of debate, the bill was passed unanimously that day and sent to the lower Chamber of Deputies on 25 November.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, Victor and {{his wife}} Julia move to Genoa City to help Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) run her company, Chancellor Industries. Julia felt {{neglected}} by Victor and sleeps with her photographer, a man named Michael. Victor created his own company, Newman Enterprises, and ended up cheating on Julia as well, with Eve Howard (Margaret Mason) and later Lorie Brooks (Jaime Lyn Bauer). Julia became pregnant and {{it is assumed that}} it was Michael’s child; Victor attacks him and Julia loses the child, revealed to actually have been Victor’s. Eve later has a child, Cole Howard (J. Eddie Peck), believed to be Victor’s son. Julia and Victor divorce and she leaves town with Michael, just as Victor begins a romance with stripper Nikki Reed (Melody Thomas Scott). Having been from the lower walks of life, Victor teaches Nikki about society. He later takes over the Prentiss family company, Prentiss Industries, and they scheme to get it back by using Lorie to seduce Victor into a marriage. On their wedding day, Victor signs the company <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> them and Lorie stands him up. Victor then tries returns to Nikki, who recently married Kevin Bancroft. Nikki ended up pregnant with Victor's child, but she ended up being manipulated into a marriage Tony DiSalvo to save her relationship with Kevin. Nikki later gives birth to a daughter named Victoria Newman (Ashley Nicole Millan). Nikki also later got involved with a man named Rick Daros, who nearly killed her before being saved by Victor. Eve Howard returns with her boyfriend, demanding that money be allocated to Cole in Victor’s will, and later takes a job as his assistant, which prompts Julia to return to protect Victor. He planned to marry Eve but faked his death on the day of their wedding, and ends up marrying Nikki in April 1984. The following year, while Victor and Nikki are vacationing, Eve reappears with Rick, and they end up stealing money from them and escaping.

However, Sigel failed to get his brigade ready at that time, forcing a delay of several hours.

Groundbreaking for the Miami extension took place in Hialeah in January 1926, and by December 1926, the line was open for freight. From January 7 though January 9, 1927, Warfield took a large faction of dignitaries on a special run of the crack Seaboard train the Orange Blossom Special, beginning at Arcadia and proceeding south to Naples, then doubling <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the east coast and proceeding south from West Palm Beach to Miami.|$|E

The paperwork submitted to the city included the names of Fay Wray, the famous star of King Kong, and Willie Sutton, a notorious New York bank robber.

25|$|San Diego then {{faced the}} Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship. Once again, the Chargers fell behind {{early as the}} Steelers built up a 13–3 halftime lead, but Humphries fooled the Steelers {{secondary}} with a 43-yard play-action touchdown pass to a wide open tight end Alfred Pupunu. The Chargers then took a 17–13 lead when Martin beat the Steelers secondary (particularly a badly overmatched Tim McKyer) down the right sideline for a 43-yard touchdown reception. On their final drive, the Steelers advanced to the San Diego 3-yard line, but Chargers linebacker Dennis Gibson sealed the victory on fourth down by deflecting quarterback Neil O'Donnell's pass intended for running back Barry Foster to turn the ball <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> San Diego. Just like the 49ers in the NFC title game, the Chargers advanced to the Super Bowl {{despite the fact that}} the Steelers had outgained them in many key statistical categories such as total plays (80–47), total offensive yards (415–226), and time of possession (37:13–22:47).|$|E
25|$|From Mission, the Canadian travels on the CPR {{route through}} the Fraser and Thompson river canyons.

Near Basque (near Lytton), both the CPR and CN are {{on the same side of}} the river and have {{crossovers}} to access each other's tracks, and it is here that the eastbound Canadian transfers from the CPR back onto the CN line. Shortly thereafter the CN line crosses <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the west/north side of the Thompson River and makes a few other crossings across the river before the staying on the north/west side for rest of the way into Kamloops and crosses the North Thompson River before arriving at the Kamloops station, which is actually in North Kamloops, across the Thompson River from downtown Kamloops.

25|$|Idaho State made an {{immediate}} impression on Oklahoma during the Sooner's first possession. With his first pass as a starter, Jones connected with wide receiver Ryan Broyles for a 34-yard gain. After a couple additional rushes and passes, Oklahoma found itself two yards {{shy of the}} end zone. After four plays, Oklahoma was unable to penetrate the end zone and turned the ball over to the Bengals. Unable to produce anything offensively, the Bengals turned the ball <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Oklahoma a short time later. On their second possession of the quarter, Jones and Broyles again connected, this time for a 24-yard touchdown pass. Oklahoma would end the first quarter up 21–0 after the OU defense sacked the Idaho State quarterback, forcing a fumble, which was returned for a touchdown. Soon came another 51-yard touchdown pass from Jones to Broyles. Jones and Broyles connected {{for a third time}} in the opening possession of the second quarter with an 11-yard touchdown pass. After another fumble recovery for the Sooners near midfield, Oklahoma increased their lead to 34–0. Oklahoma added one more touchdown before halftime to go up 41–0. By halftime, Idaho State had accumulated negative-two yards of total offense.|$|E

25|$|Four {{plays into}} the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide {{receiver}} Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain {{to put the}} Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13-yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots' lead to 31–28. Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38–28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 {{to set up a}} 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41–28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1-yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44-yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green-Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins' red zone on back-to-back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter. On the six play of the drive, a fourth down, Green-Ellis ran for a 1-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 48–28 lead. Down by 20 points, the Dolphins ran one play in the remaining 37 seconds to end the game and improve the Patriots' record to 7–4.|$|E
