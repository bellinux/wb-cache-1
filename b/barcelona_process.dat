50|$|On 1 November 1478, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella {{received}} {{permission from}} Pope Sixtus IV to name Inquisitors throughout their domains, to protect Catholicism {{as the true}} faith. It originally applied to the Crown of Castile — the domain of Isabella — but in 1483, Ferdinand extended it to his domain of the Crown of Aragon. Ferdinand's action met with great resistance, and resulted in the assassination by conversos in 1485 of Pedro de Arbués. In spite of this social discontent it is considered that between 1487 and 1505 the Chapter of <b>Barcelona</b> <b>processed</b> more than 1000 people, of which only 25 were absolved.|$|R
50|$|The northernmost {{part of the}} quarter, La Ribera {{proper and}} Sant Pere, in {{contrast}} to El Born, is not frequented by tourists so much, {{even though it is}} between Arc de Triomf and Via Laietana, and actually constitutes a much poorer area with a larger number of migrant workers. It is being revitalised, but as with many other instances of urban development in <b>Barcelona,</b> the <b>process</b> has been ethically contested. The Forat de la Vergonya area, near Santa Eulàlia Cathedral, is such an example. The Biblioteca Francesca Bonnemaison is a cultural institution of the neighbourhood.|$|R

25|$|Moreover, the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>Process</b> {{included}} 6 {{countries and}} institutions participating as permanent observers (Libya, Mauritania, the Secretary-General of the Arab League) and invited observers, {{such as the}} European Investment Bank, the Arab Maghreb Union, the Anna Lindh Foundation for the Dialogue between Cultures, the Economical and Social Committee or the Euromed Economical and Social Councils.|$|E

Two more straight wins improved World Bowl prospects, but a narrow 10-9 defeat to the Monarchs in the penultimate week left the Claymores needing a victory in Barcelona against the Dragons - however, they were trounced 46-18 and finished the season 5-5, surrendering the second World Bowl spot to <b>Barcelona</b> in the <b>process.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract This article {{explains}} the social transformation process initiated {{at the end}} of the 1970 s within the neighborhood of La Verneda-Sant Martı ́ in <b>Barcelona.</b> This <b>process</b> started with the foundation of an adult education center that was organized as a Learning Community (the first one in the world). From the beginning, it was administered for and by the community. It became a space of debate where the demands and dreams of the neighbors converged about transforming their neighborhood along with the recom-mendations of the international scientific community. Twenty years later, the dreams came true: There have been substantial improvements through-out the urban space, infrastructures, housing, urban thoroughfares, and public highways. The INCLUD-ED European project, using the communi-cative methodology of research, has thoroughly studied the transformation carried out in the La Verneda-Sant Martı ́ Adult School and its neighbor-hood. INCLUD-ED has identified successful practices within diverse social areas that are transferable to other contexts and contribute to overcoming inequalities and improving the most underprivileged neighborhoods...|$|R
40|$|Retracing the {{contemporary}} {{history of a}} peripheral neighbourhood of <b>Barcelona</b> undergoing a <b>process</b> of complete demolition, the author reflects on the “structural homology” between the spatial configuration and the social order, a complexity that ethnography is able to capture and share with planners and other professionals. Repensar Bonpastor is a multidisciplinary device with which an independent group of architects, urban planners and anthropologists faced the difficulties of elaborating a collective alternative to the demolitions and forced evictions that are disrupting the social life of this stigmatized neighbourhood, through socializing the difficulties of the inhabitants with a wider community...|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} with the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>Process,</b> {{one of the biggest}} innovations of the Union for the Mediterranean is its institutional architecture. It was decided at the Paris Summit to provide the Union with a whole set of institutions in order to up-grade the political level of its relations, promote a further co-ownership of the initiative among the EU and Mediterranean partner countries and improve the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership's visibility.|$|E
25|$|The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, {{also known}} as the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>Process,</b> was created in 1995 {{as a result of the}} Conference of Euro-Mediterranean Ministers of Foreign Affairs held in Barcelona on 27 and 28 November under the Spanish {{presidency}} of the EU. The founding act of the Partnership in 1995 and Final Declaration of the Barcelona Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference is called the Barcelona Declaration, which is often used to refer to the Process itself.|$|E
25|$|Other {{criticisms of}} the {{proposal}} included concern {{about the relationship between}} the proposed UfM and the existing Euromediterranean Partnership (<b>Barcelona</b> <b>Process),</b> which might reduce the effectiveness of EU policies in the region and allow the southern countries to play on the rivalries to escape unpopular EU policies. There were similar economic concerns in the loss of civil society and similar human rights based policies. Duplication of policies from the EU's police and judicial area was a further worry.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} the record investment, Real Madrid overall failed to deliver in the 2009-10 season; there was no {{progress}} in the Champions League, as they were eliminated {{once again in the}} round of 16, this time to Lyon. There was, however, an improvement in Liga performance, and the club forced the title race to go down to go the last game. Nevertheless, Real Madrid finished second again, and once again they lost at home and away to title rivals Barcelona. The club turned to José Mourinho, who had just ended Internazionale's 45-year title-drought in the European competition, eliminating <b>Barcelona</b> in the <b>process</b> and achieving the treble.|$|R
50|$|Atlético had not won La Liga for 10 {{years and}} were desperate for league success. Right away, Gil spent heavily, {{bringing}} {{in a number of}} expensive signings, most notably Portuguese winger Paulo Futre, who had just won the European Cup with Porto. All the spending, however, only brought in two consecutive Copa del Rey trophies in 1991 and 1992 as the league title proved elusive. The closest Atlético came to the La Liga trophy was the 1990-91 season when they finished runners-up by 10 points to Johan Cruyff's <b>Barcelona.</b> In the <b>process,</b> Gil developed a ruthless reputation due to the manner in which he ran the club. In pursuit of league success, he hired and fired a number of high-profile head coaches, including César Luis Menotti, Ron Atkinson, Javier Clemente, Tomislav Ivić, Francisco Maturana, Alfio Basile as well as club legend Luis Aragonés.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBelow is {{presented}} {{a study of}} urban marginality which purpose {{is the creation of}} a database enabling the selection of the neighbourhoods with highest degree of marginality in the city of <b>Barcelona.</b> The research <b>process</b> has been developed through a bibliographic analysis framed on the theory and the results of the investigations of Loïc Wacquant (2007; 2009; 2011), with a particular focus on the concept of “advanced marginality”. The results obtained through a descriptive statistical analysis allowed the selection of three neighbourhoods whose residents are characterized by an increased presence of indicators of marginality: Besòs i Maresme (district of San Marti) Ciutat Meridiana (district of Nou Barris) and Trinitat Vella (district of Sant Andreu). On the basis of the definition of marginality, a questionnaire template was designed in order to analyse the feelings of Barcelona's citizens about insecurity. The questionnaire aims to outline similarities and differences between two demographic groups (the marginality and the citizens at large) and, at the same time, verify how aspects such as gender, age, income, etc. affect the feeling of insecurity...|$|R
25|$|By some analysts, {{the process}} has been {{declared}} ineffective. The stalling of the Middle East Peace Process is having an impact on the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>Process</b> and is hindering progress especially in the first basket. The economic basket can be considered a success, and there have been more projects for the exchange on a cultural level and between the peoples in the riparian states. Other criticism is mainly based on the predominant role the European Union is playing. Normally it is the EU that is assessing the state of affairs, which leads to the impression that the North is dictating the South what to do. The question of an enhanced co-ownership of {{the process has}} repeatedly been brought up over the last years.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} much avant-garde {{architectural}} {{work has been}} dominated by a process based theoretical paradigm, inspired largely by various thinkers, critics, and philosophers. This particular “process practice” attempts to address the paradox at the heart of contemporary production, by looking dialectically at the relationship between structure and ornament in nature with brainstorming and use of computer simulation. The goal {{of this paper is to}} develop a computer optimized system that can generate solutions for defining spaces involving a number of contextual relationships of activities. In particular, this research undertakes a pilot study (working team: Ashik Vaskor Mannan, Masrur Mamun Mithun, Lau Hon Yee Damien) on pattern and behaviour in nature and implements the findings in to an architectural problem. The Initial Research focuses on Theory of emergence, Analysis of swarm behaviour, and Analysis of ant system. Specific urban sites with different behaviour patterns are chosen in <b>Barcelona</b> where this <b>process</b> is implemented to examine how they response to this course of action. This Bottom up method provides an optimum solution instead of a top down solution for an architectural proble...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to relate the modes of contracting, work, and remuneration in the tertiary sub-sector of maritime cargo-handling in the port of <b>Barcelona</b> during the <b>process</b> of the liberalization of the trades (c. 1760 - 1840). The guilds studied were charged {{with all of the}} activities of the processes of loading and unloading of goods from merchant ships to and from the beach; the transportation of these goods to and within the Customs House (and supervising their temporary storage here); and the subsequent delivery of goods to the owners, either directly or by transportation to storage facilities, stores, or other locations. These responsibilities were codified in guild ordinances that established monopolistic privileges (and prohibitions against non-guild members). The relationship between the mode of work and the organizational model of the respective guilds is noteworthy: these practices and models were based on customs and traditions, reflected group values, and were given official status in guild charters and the privileges contained therein. These officially recognized practices were challenged by merchants and local authorities and were eventually delegitimized during the process of liberalizing the trades...|$|R

2500|$|At {{the time}} of its creation, the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership {{comprised}} 27 member countries: 15 from the European Union and 12 Mediterranean countries (Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, Tunisia, and Turkey). As a result of the European Union's enlargements of 2004 and 2007 the number of EU member states grew up to 27, [...] and two of the Mediterranean partner countries—Cyprus and Malta—became part of the European Union. The EU enlargement changed the configuration of the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>Process</b> from [...] "15+12" [...] to [...] "27+10." [...] Albania and Mauritania joined the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>Process</b> in 2007, raising the number of participants to 39.|$|E
2500|$|For many, the {{political}} context surrounding the 2005 summit — the stagnation of the Middle East Peace Process, the US-led war on Iraq, {{the lack of}} democratisation in Arab countries, {{and the war on}} terror's negative effects on freedoms and human rights, among others—proved for many the inefficiency of the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>Process</b> for fulfilling its objectives of peace, stability and prosperity. Given these circumstances, even politicians that had been engaged with the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>Process</b> since its very beginnings, like the Spanish politician Josep Borrell, expressed their disappointment about the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and its incapacity to deliver results. Critiques from Southern Mediterranean countries blamed the Partnership's failure on Europe's lack of interest towards the Mediterranean in favour of its Eastern neighbourhood; whereas experts from the North accused Southern countries of only being interested on [...] "their own bi-lateral relationship with the EU" [...] while downplaying multilateral policies.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fact that}} the Union for the Mediterranean is {{launched}} as a new phase of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership means that the Union accepts and commits to maintain the acquis of Barcelona, the purpose {{of which is to}} promote [...] "peace, stability and prosperity" [...] throughout the region (Barcelona, 2).

2500|$|At the Paris Summit for the Mediterranean (13 July 2008), the 43 Heads of State and Government {{from the}} Euro-Mediterranean region decided {{to launch the}} Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean.

2500|$|At {{the start}} of 2008 Sarkozy began to modify {{his plans for the}} Mediterranean Union due to {{widespread}} opposition from other EU member states and the European Commission. At the end of February of that year, France's minister for European affairs, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, stated that [...] "there is no Mediterranean Union" [...] but rather a [...] "Union for the Mediterranean" [...] that would only be [...] "completing and enriching" [...] to existing EU structures and policy in the region. Following a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel it was agreed that the project would include all EU member states, not just those bordering the Mediterranean, and would be built upon the existing <b>Barcelona</b> <b>process.</b> Turkey also agreed {{to take part in the}} project following a guarantee from France that it was no longer intended as an alternative to EU membership.|$|E
2500|$|Criticism of the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>Process</b> {{escalated}} {{after the}} celebration of the 10th Anniversary of the Euro-Mediterranean Summit in Barcelona in 2005, which was broadly considered a failure. First, the absence of Heads of State and Government from the Southern Mediterranean countries (with the exception of the Palestinian and Turkish ones) heavily contrasted with the attendance of the 27 European Union's Heads of State and Government. Second, the lack of consensus to define the term [...] "terrorism" [...] prevented the endorsement of a final declaration. The Palestinian Authority, Syria and Algeria argued that resistance movements against foreign occupation should not be included in this definition. Nevertheless, a code of conduct on countering terrorism and a five-year work program were approved at Barcelona summit of 2005. both of which are still valid under the Union for the Mediterranean.|$|E
2500|$|However the European Commission and Germany {{were more}} {{cautious}} about the project. The European Commission saying that while initiatives promoting regional co-operation were good, {{it would be}} better to build them upon existing structures, notable among them being the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>process.</b> German chancellor Angela Merkel said the UfM risked splitting and threatening the core of the EU. In particular she objected to the potential use of EU funds to fund a project which was only to include a small number of EU member states. When Slovenia took the EU presidency at the beginning of 2008, the then Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša added to the criticism by saying: [...] "We do not need a duplication of institutions, or institutions that would compete with EU, institutions that would cover part of the EU and part of the neighbourhood." ...|$|E
