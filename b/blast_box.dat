50|$|The blast {{happened}} in a school house used to teach Qur'an to the children. The blast took place soon after a class was completed at about 9 am and the students were leaving the house. Forty other houses were destroyed and 60 people were injured. The house was owned by Riaz Ahmad Kamboh, a religious teacher. The blast left a crater 40 feet wide and 8 feet deep. After the <b>blast</b> a steel <b>box</b> containing audio tapes of sermons by clerics belonging to Lashkar-e-Jhangvi was recovered from the house. It appeared {{that the house was}} also being used as an ammunition dump. According to the police small rockets and missiles propelled by shoulder-fired launchers were among the other material recovered from the site. It was theorized that the blast was accidental.|$|R
50|$|The station {{opened in}} April 1849 by the East and West Yorkshire Junction Railway. The station was {{situated}} {{east of the}} level crossing on New Road. There were five freight sidings at the station, northwest of the level crossing on the down side with a long head shunt. In 1913 livestock was handled here {{but there were no}} general goods facilities; only 'bulk traffic' was dealt with. NER figures of 1911 revealed that 368 people lived within the settlement and only 4405 tickets were sold in the year. During the First World War, most lightly used station closed during 1916-17, although Hessay closed as early as 22 September 1915. A reason for this was due to its closeness to Marston Moor. There was no distinct reopening date for Hessay after the First World War had ended. One service had appeared in the Bradshaw timetable in June 1919 for York passengers, but only on Saturdays. In Reid's timetable of June 1920, 'Hessay (closed)' confusingly appeared with an up service for c9:15am and a down service for c3:39pm for York passengers and, again, on Saturdays only. In July 1922, services were restored for all weekdays. When the Second World War began, War Department sidings were built at the station on the down side and south west of the existing sidings. Like Goldsborough, there were also wartime additions to the infrastructure, including a <b>blast</b> proof signal <b>box.</b> The station closed to passengers on 15 September 1958. Goods continued to be handled at the station until 4 May 1964 but the War Department sidings continued to be used by the Ministry of Defence until 1991.|$|R
