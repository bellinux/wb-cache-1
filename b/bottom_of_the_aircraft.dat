25|$|A unique {{supersonic}} {{escape capsule}} {{was designed for}} the XF-103. The pilot's seat was located in a shell with a large movable shield in front that was normally slid down into the area {{in front of the}} pilot's legs. In the case of depressurization, the shield would slide {{up in front of the}} pilot, sealing the seat into a pressurized pod. Basic flight instruments inside the capsule allowed the aircraft to be flown back to base, and a window in the front of the shield allowed the periscope system to be used. In an emergency, the entire capsule would be ejected downward, along with a small portion of the aircraft fuselage that provided a stable aerodynamic shape. To enter and exit the aircraft, the ejection module was lowered on rails out of the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aircraft,</b> allowing the pilot to simply walk into the seat, sit down, and raise the module into the aircraft. The capsule was fully pressurized, allowing the pilot to continue operating the aircraft without a pressure suit when the capsule was locked up.|$|E

In the summer of 1951, {{the two sides of the}} conflict appeared to be reaching a truce one year after the war began. However, as the negotiations continued, North Korean and Chinese troops began moving supplies to the front lines while negotiations were taking place.

The arclights, with an estimated 80 million candlepower, would easily illuminate supply trains but also expose the UN aircraft to antiaircraft fire. As such, North Korean and Chinese trains were heavily equipped with such guns, and the valleys through which they traveled were heavily fortified with anti-air capability. Walmsley was one of the first pilots to volunteer for the dangerous mission.|$|E

Finally, they had also invested in a technically advanced remote-control defensive gun system, which they had been experimenting with for several years. The system used a gunsight located in the rear cockpit, operated by the navigator/gunner, which had optics on both the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aircraft,</b> allowing aim in any direction.

40|$|International audienceIn-situ {{measurements}} of ozone and water vapour, in the Antarctic lower stratosphere, were made as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> APE-GAIA mission in September and October 1999. The measurements show a distinct difference {{above and below}} the 415 K isentrope. Above 415 K, the chemically perturbed region of low ozone and water vapour is clearly evident. Below 415 K, but still above the tropopause, no sharp meridional gradients in ozone and water vapour were observed. The observations are consistent with analyses of potential vorticity from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, which show smaller radial gradients at 380 K than at 450 K potential temperature. Ozone loss in the chemically perturbed region above 415 K averages 5 ppbv per day for mid-September to mid-October. Apparent ozone loss rates in the sub-vortex region are greater, at 7 ppbv per day. The data support, therefore, <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> a sub-vortex region in which meridional transport is more efficient than in the vortex above.

Two target materials related to aircraft structure were considered, i. e., aluminium alloy, 2014 -T 6 and carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP). Two projectile nose shapes - including flat and hemisphere - were used to account for <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> debris on <b>the</b> ballistic performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThis {{report is}} {{primarily}} concerned with {{a detailed description of}} an automatic haze recorder. An introductory haze discussion is included to facilitate <b>the</b> overall evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program. Although there is a wealth of experimental data for ground-to-ground haze measurements. there exist only fragmentary data for the air-to-ground case. <b>The</b> data <b>of</b> Waldram, and Carman and Carruthers comprise <b>the</b> known extent <b>of</b> published aerial haze studies which are statistically based on a series of programmed flight-test measurements. Even in these cases <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> flights was small. It is therefore essential to <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> a statistical model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere that extensive flight measurements be made over various conditions and up to altitudes <b>of</b> 40000 ft. <b>The</b> automatic haze recorder consists basically of an airborne telephotometer and its associated equipment: the telephotometer itself, an indexing mount~ a recording assembly, and a control assembly and starting box. Each of these items is described in detail. <b>The</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> telephotometer consists <b>of</b> a device which rotates a right prism about an axis normal and concentric to one <b>of</b> its faces. <b>The</b> telephotometer is mounted on <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> an <b>aircraft</b> in such a manner that this prism assembly extends below <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> skin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and that <b>the</b> axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prism rotation is maintained parallel to <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth. The upwelling light from a 15 Â° cone entering the prism is reflected along its axis of rotation and, by means of a fixed right prism into the photometric system. In this manner the rotating prism scans a path 15 Â° wide, which stretches beneath <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> from horizon to horizon. In the photometric system the upwelling light is projected through an appropriate filter onto a photomultiplier tube. <b>The</b> output <b>of</b> this tube is read directly as <b>the</b> vertical deflection <b>of</b> an oscilloscope which is mounted in the recording assembly. <b>The</b> horizontal deflection <b>of</b> this scope is made proportional to the scanning angle by a gear-driven potentiometer. In this manner the scope makes a trace of upwelling intensity vs angle for a given set of conditions. Each scope trace, together with other pertinent data, is photographed by the recording assembly. The indexing mount rotates the telephotometer, and thus the scanning plane, about the vertical axis. The control assembly, once started, automatically cycles the overall system in the following manner. A blue record, then a green record, then a red record are separately photographed at the indexing mount setting (azimuth) of 0 Â°. Then the mount turns the instrument to an azimuth of 45 Â° and the above three records are made again. This sequence is repeated at settings of 90 Â°, 135 Â°, 180 Â°, 135 Â°, 90 Â°, and 45 Â°. The head is then returned to 0 Â°, and the assembly is again ready for another cycle. <b>The</b> lapsed time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complete cycle is somewhat less than 1 / 3 <b>of</b> a minute. <b>The</b> instrument has been constructed and successfully laboratory-tested. It has had only a single, preliminary flight test, but on this the performance equaled or exceeded the design expectations. Proposals for future flight-test programs are discussed...|$|R
