5000|$|All the {{vegetables}} and herbs are chopped {{and put into}} a large container (alternatively, the tomatoes may be puréed in a <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> <b>food</b> processor, pounded in a mortar (the traditional method), or strained and de-seeded with a food mill) ...|$|E
5000|$|This {{piece of}} kitchen equipment, of long-proven efficiency, bridges {{the gap between}} a sieve (or tamis, china cap, or chinoise) and the {{electric}} <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> <b>food</b> processor. Its function {{is similar to that}} of a potato ricer or [...] "hob" [...] type of spätzle maker.|$|E
50|$|The spice {{mixture is}} {{commonly}} made by slicing, chopping, grinding, beating, bruising, or sometimes burning the spices, using traditional cooking {{tools such as}} stone mortar and pestle, or a modern <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> <b>food</b> processor. The bumbu mixture was usually stir fried in hot cooking oil first to release its aroma, prior to adding the main ingredient (meats, poultry, or fish).|$|E
50|$|Chutneys may {{be ground}} with {{a mortar and pestle}} or an ammikkal (Tamil). Spices are added and ground, usually in a {{particular}} order; the wet paste thus made is sautéed in vegetable oil, usually gingelly (sesame) or peanut oil. Electric <b>blenders</b> <b>or</b> <b>food</b> processors can be used as labor-saving alternatives to stone grinding.|$|R
50|$|An {{immersion}} blender, stick blender, wand <b>blender,</b> hand <b>blender,</b> <b>or</b> Bermixer (after {{the brand}} name of professional models made by Dito-Electrolux) is a kitchen blade grinder used to blend ingredients <b>or</b> purée <b>food</b> in the container {{in which they are}} being prepared. Larger immersion blenders for commercial use are sometimes nicknamed boat motors (popularized by Emeril Lagasse and Alton Brown). Uses include puréeing soups and emulsifying sauces.|$|R
50|$|The {{hand-held}} immersion <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> stick <b>blender</b> has no {{container of}} its own, but instead has a mixing head with rotating blades {{that can be}} immersed in a container. Immersion blenders are convenient for homogenizing volumes that are too large to fit {{in the bowl of}} a stationary <b>blender</b> <b>or,</b> as in the case of soups, are too hot to be safely poured into the bowl.|$|R
5000|$|Daun ubi tumbuk (Indonesian for [...] "pounded cassava leaves") is a {{vegetable}} dish {{commonly found in}} Indonesia, made from pounded cassava leaves. In Indonesian, daun means leaf, ubi refers to cassava, and tumbuk means pounded. The cassava leaves are traditionally pounded with a wooden mortar and pestle, although finely chopping or puréeing them using a <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> <b>food</b> processor is an alternative.|$|E
50|$|The fire used {{in cooking}} {{can be either}} strong fire or small fire for slow cooking. Cooking nasi goreng usually employs strong fire, while {{authentic}} rendang for example requires small fire for slow cooking of beef, spices, and coconut milk until the meat is caramelised and all the coconut milk's liquid has evaporated. Traditional Indonesian dapur (kitchen) usually employs firewood-fuelled kitchen stove, while the contemporary household today uses liquefied petroleum gas-fuelled stove or an electric stove. The ingredients could be cut in pieces, sliced thinly, or ground into a paste. Cooking utensils are wajan (wok), penggorengan (frying pan), panci (cauldron), knives, several types of spoon and fork, parutan (shredder), cobek and ulekan (stone mortar and pestle). Traditionally Indonesians use a stone mortar and a pestle to grind the spices and ingredients into coarse or fine pastes. Today most households use <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> <b>food</b> processor for the task. Traditional Indonesian cookingwares are usually made from stone, earthenware pottery, wood, and woven bamboo or a rattan container or filter, while contemporary cookingwares, plates and containers use metals - iron, tin, stainless steel, aluminium, ceramics, plastics, and also glass.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{prepared}} {{at least a}} day or more in advance by braising or simmering a piece of veal from the back leg called Eye Round, which is then cut into thin, individual servings. For the sauce, originally fresh white tuna (in most restaurants canned tuna is used today to reduce cost and preparation time) is simmered until fully cooked in white wine, cider vinegar, white onion and garlic, and then puréed with a mix of olive and vegetable oil and egg yolks in an electric <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> <b>food</b> processor to form a thick mayonnaise. For the mayonnaise a variety of seasonings can be used, including anchovies, cayenne pepper and lemon juice. The thick, smooth purée is then somewhat thinned with a little water and cooking liquid from the veal and a few capers are stirred in. Some of the sauce is spread out on a serving platter and the cold slices of veal are arranged {{in a single layer on}} top. The rest of the sauce is then poured over the veal so that it is, generally, completely covered. The dish is allowed to refrigerate for a period up to 5 days to fully develop the flavor.|$|E
50|$|Then {{once the}} winner has been decided {{the walls of}} the studio open up to reveal a prize (usually a <b>food</b> <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> set of saucepans).|$|R

50|$|Finally, 3D {{computer}} graphics software such as Maya, <b>Blender</b> <b>or</b> 3D Studio Max {{can also be}} thought of {{as an extension of the}} traditional 2D vector editors, as they share some common concepts and tools.|$|R
50|$|A coffee cabinet is an ice cream-based {{beverage}} found {{almost exclusively}} in Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, consisting of coffee ice cream, coffee syrup, and milk. The ingredients are mixed in a drink <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> milkshake <b>blender.</b>|$|R
50|$|Burnishing is a {{blending}} {{technique in}} which a colorless <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> a light-colored pencil is applied firmly to an already layered drawing. This produces a shiny surface of blended colors that gets deep into {{the grain of the}} paper.|$|R
5000|$|... ====Food preparation==== In {{kitchen or}} {{laboratory}} settings, solids may be chopped into smaller parts sometimes {{in combination with}} a liquid, for example in <b>food</b> preparation <b>or</b> laboratory use. This may be done with a <b>blender,</b> <b>or</b> liquidiser in British English.|$|R
5000|$|Full-service restaurants, soda fountains, and diners usually {{prepare and}} mix the shake [...] "by hand" [...] from scoops {{of ice cream}} and milk in a <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> drink mixer using a {{stainless}} steel cup. Many fast food outlets do not make shakes by hand with ice cream. Instead, they make shakes in automatic milkshake machines which freeze and serve a premade milkshake mixture consisting of milk, a sweetened flavoring agent, and a thickening agent. However, some fast food outlets still follow the traditional method, and some serve milkshakes which are prepared by blending soft-serve ice cream (or ice milk) with flavoring or syrups. Milkshakes can also be made {{at home with a}} <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> automatic drink mixer.|$|R
5000|$|Pour [...] {{of coconut}} cream, [...] of {{pineapple}} juice and [...] of white rum into a <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> shaker with crushed ice, and blend or shake very well until smooth. Pour into chilled glass, garnish with pineapple wedge and/or a maraschino cherry.|$|R
50|$|Ryzen's multi-threaded performance, in {{some cases}} while using <b>Blender</b> <b>or</b> other {{open-source}} software, was around four times {{the performance of the}} FX-8370. One reviewer found that Ryzen chips would typically outperform competing Intel i7 processors for a fraction of the price when all eight cores were utilized.|$|R
50|$|The Glencadam {{distillery}} is a distillery in Brechin, Angus, Scotland {{that produces}} single malt Scotch whisky. The distillery {{is owned by}} Angus Dundee plc and produces one malt whisky, with the remainder of production sold to <b>blenders</b> <b>or</b> used within Angus Dundee plc for use in blended whisky brands.|$|R
50|$|Purées {{can be made}} in a <b>blender,</b> <b>or</b> {{with special}} {{implements}} such as a potato masher, or by forcing the food through a strainer, or simply by crushing the food in a pot. Purées generally must be cooked, either before or after grinding, in order to improve flavour and texture, remove toxic substances, and/or reduce their water content.|$|R
50|$|Many {{computer}} users think that traditional 3D modeling {{programs such as}} <b>Blender</b> <b>or</b> Maya have a high learning curve. Novice users often have difficulty creating models in traditional modeling programs without first completing a lengthy series of tutorials. Sketch-based modeling tools aim {{to solve this problem}} by creating a User interface which is similar to drawing, which most users are familiar with.|$|R
50|$|Avena is {{prepared}} using water and milk {{brought to a}} boil. Sugar and {{a small amount of}} oatmeal is added and cooked. If water is used, some amount of milk may optionally be added at the end of cooking. The oats may then be strained out, blended using a <b>blender,</b> <b>or</b> simply allowed to settle {{to the bottom of the}} pitcher. Cinnamon is sometimes used as well.|$|R
5000|$|On June 22, 2016, the EPA {{announced}} that it was considering changes to the enforcement of blending standards.

50|$|Open Wonderland aims {{to provide}} a secure world in which {{organizations}} may do business, or allow employees to collaborate online. It is eventually intended to allow edits {{to be made to}} a virtual world with XML files instead of having to make changes to the source code and to add an in-world method of creating content. At present, all content is made with external tools, such as <b>Blender</b> <b>or</b> Google SketchUp.|$|R
50|$|In both sweetcrust and shortcrust pastry, {{care must}} be taken to ensure that fat and flour are blended {{thoroughly}} before liquid is added. This ensures that the flour granules are adequately coated with fat and are less likely to develop gluten and may be achieved {{with the use of a}} food processor, a specialized kitchen utensil called a pastry <b>blender,</b> <b>or</b> through various alternatives, like a pair of table knives held in one hand.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The game {{engine is}} {{important}} for players and developers alike. The development-kit is built around it, game editors use it to build levels. Tools such as <b>Blender</b> <b>or</b> 3ds Max are employed to create the geometry of object and/or animations of those. Game data has reached enormous amounts.

50|$|Natively using {{a subset}} of the Alias object (OBJ) file format and a text-based markup for content files, Poser comes with a large library of pre-rigged human, animal, robotic, and cartoon figures. The package also {{includes}} poses, hair pieces, props, textures, hand gestures and facial expressions. As Poser itself does not allow for original modeling of objects, a large community market of artists emerged, creating and selling Poser content, made using third-party software like modo, ZBrush, <b>Blender</b> <b>or</b> Autodesk 3ds Max.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} the {{electric}} blender, malted milk drinks, and milkshakes are interconnected. Before the widespread availability of electric blenders, milkshake-type drinks were more like eggnog, or they were a hand-shaken mixture of crushed ice and milk, sugar, and flavorings. Hamilton Beach's drink mixers began being used at soda fountains in 1911 and the electric <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> drink mixer was invented by Steven Poplawski in 1922. With {{the invention of the}} blender, milkshakes began to take their modern, whipped, aerated, and frothy form.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shortening}} method, {{also known}} as the biscuit method, is used for biscuits and scones. This method cuts solid fat (whether lard, butter, or vegetable shortening) into flour and other dry ingredients using a <b>food</b> processor, pastry <b>blender,</b> <b>or</b> two hand-held forks. The layering from this process gives rise and adds flakiness as the folds of fat melt during baking. This technique is said to produce [...] "shortened" [...] cakes and breads, {{regardless of whether or not}} the chosen fat is vegetable shortening.|$|R
2500|$|The Obama Administration set {{the goal}} of {{installing}} 10,000 blender pumps nationwide until 2015. <b>Blender</b> <b>or</b> flexible fuel pumps simultaneously dispense E85 and other lower blends such as E50, E30 and E20 {{that can be used}} by E85 flex-fuel vehicles. On April 2011 the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) issue a rule to include flexible fuel pumps [...] in the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). This rule will provide financial assistance, via grants and guaranteed loans, to fuel station owners to install E85 and blender pumps.|$|R

The various ingredients can be mixed or puréed together using a <b>food</b> processor, a <b>blender,</b> <b>or</b> by hand. Bean dip is sometimes topped with shredded cheese and garnished with ingredients such as chopped cilantro, chopped green onion, chopped fresh or dried parsley and lime zest, among others.|$|R
50|$|More recently, foams {{have become}} a part of {{molecular}} gastronomy technique. In these cases, natural flavors (such as fruit juices, infusions of aromatic herbs, etc.) are mixed with a neutrally-flavored gelling or stabilizing agent such as agar or lecithin, and either whipped with a hand-held immersion <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> extruded through a whipped cream canister equipped with nitrous oxide cartridges. Some famous food-foams are foamed espresso, foamed mushroom, foamed beet and foamed coconut. An espuma or thermo whip is commonly used to make these foams through the making of a stock, creating a gel and extruding through the nitrous oxide canister.|$|R

Fresh cheese finely chopped is added, stir again {{for a few seconds}} and retrieve the pot from the fire. Kiveve used to be cooked in clay pots.|$|R
5000|$|Adrià is {{well known}} for {{creating}} [...] "culinary foam." [...] Adrià explored foams created without the addition of cream or egg white; foams are made of a flavoured liquid and an additive (such as lecithin), then aerated through a variety of methods, including whipping with an immersion <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> extrusion from a siphon bottle equipped with N2O cartridges. Further culinary processes (such as freeze-drying or freezing with liquid nitrogen) may be applied to foams as well. Using a single flavoured liquid allows the flavour of the final product to be less diluted and thus more intense.|$|R
5000|$|Mole blanco ("white mole") {{is a type}} of mole of {{the cuisine}} of Mexico.
