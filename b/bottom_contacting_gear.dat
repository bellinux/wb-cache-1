40|$|Deep-water corals {{can form}} {{structurally}} complex habitats that harbour diverse associated fauna. Although largely hidden from view, these habitats {{are susceptible to}} anthropogenic impacts such as fishing with <b>bottom</b> <b>contacting</b> <b>gear.</b> Over the past decades, scientific interest in deep-water corals has intensified and following {{the discovery of the}} extent of human impacts to these vulnerable ecosystems, multiple conservation areas have been established. To date, information on coral ecosystem recovery capacity and thus the effectiveness of conservation measures remain scarce. Insights on key ecological traits of deep-water corals can aid marine spatial planning and management of deep-water coral conservation areas. In this thesis, I studied distribution patterns as well as changes in growth and abundance of coral colonies over time in the Northeast Channel Coral Conservation Area (NECCCA) established {{at the entrance to the}} Gulf of Maine in 2002. Analyses were based on videos collected by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in 2001, 2006, 2010 and 2014. I evaluate the recovery potential of the two dominant coral species in the NECCCA and present how information on distribution, abundance and growth of corals can be used to inform marine spatial planning [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{is intended to}} address the PFMC’s request to provide a potential approach to evaluating {{the question of whether}} current essential fish habitat (EFH) designations are working as expected, including criteria for objective evaluation of the question. Essential fish habitat boundaries for groundfish and a number of habitat areas of particular concern (HAPCs) were established in Amendment 19. The entire shelf and slope area was designated as EFH, but this designation alone does not provide any fishing restrictions. Also through Amendment 19, a number of areas were permanently closed to certain types of <b>bottom</b> <b>contact</b> <b>gear</b> to protect groundfish EFH – the Amendment 19 EFH Conservation Areas. Amendment 19 also included several fishing gear restrictions that are not area specific and recommendations for addressing non-fishing impacts. Together, these measures were designed to fulfill the requirements for EFH established by the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Note that a number of management activities, including the establishment of the spatial and temporal closures termed the Rockfish Conservation Area in 2002, were put in place prior to Amendment 19. We focus most of our discussion in this report on issues related to Amendment 19...|$|R
40|$|We are {{submitting}} {{the attached}} proposal {{in response to}} the Pacific Fishery Management Council’s call for proposals for changes to Groundfish Essential Fish Habitat (EFH). We recommend modification to the Olympic 2 and Grays Canyon EFH closures to increase protections for identified deep-sea coral and sponge habitat from bottom trawling and, in Juan de Fuca Canyon, from other <b>bottom</b> <b>contact</b> <b>gear.</b> This proposal follows the 2004 and 2006 research on deep sea coral and sponge communities in the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS) and the 2007 and 2008 discoveries of glass sponge reef habitat near Grays Canyon. We have used the best available science, social and economic information, and direction provided by the law to design a practicable management approach that protects essential fish habitat while maintaining vibrant fisheries. As you know, Oceana was actively engaged in the 2005 Pacific Groundfish EFH process, which resulted in significant conservation measures for EFH off the U. S. West Coast. In that process, the Council recognized the need for an adaptive management approach to modify EFH identification and conservation measures as new information becomes available. Thus, in 2006 and again in 2007, we brought to the Council’s attention the discovery of coral and spong...|$|R
40|$|The Irish {{monitoring}} programme for Descriptor 3 “Commercial fish and shellfish” and fish biodiversity (D 1, D 4 and D 6) {{is based on}} the monitoring required under the obligation of the Data Collection Framework Directive (EC 665 / 2008; 2010 / 93 /EU) for the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy and for additional stocks/species of national importance. There are two main sources of data collected as part of Ireland’s {{monitoring programme}}; fishery independent and fishery dependent data. The first involves monitoring the temporal and spatial changes in the fish populations using fisheries surveys on research vessels and commercial vessels. Fishery dependant data involves collecting and analysing biological data (age, length etc.) of the fish caught, together with data on the quantities of fish caught and the fishing effort. The fish and fisheries monitoring programme includes the evaluation of the fishing sector using capacity and activity, pressure monitoring of contributing activities in terms of distribution and intensity of effort, landings and discards of fish and shellfish and accidental bycatch of other species. Pressure on habitats is partially monitored based on the spatial and temporal distribution of <b>bottom</b> <b>contacting</b> fishing <b>gear</b> within mapped habitats.

Alternative low-cost <b>bottom</b> <b>contact</b> metallization for high performance short-channel organic thin film transistors are scarce because of the incompatibility of the <b>bottom</b> <b>contact</b> material with the cleaning step.

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation is presented which {{shows how the}} <b>gear</b> <b>contact</b> ratio affects the dynamic load on a spur <b>gear</b> transmission. The <b>contact</b> ratio can {{be affected by the}} tooth addendum, the pressure angle, the tooth size (diametral pitch), and the center distance. The analysis presented was performed using the NASA gear dynamics code, DANST. In the analysis, the contact ratio was varied over the range 1. 20 to 2. 40 by changing the length of the tooth addendum. In order to simplify the analysis, other parameters related to contact ratio were held constant. The contact ratio was found to have a significant influence on gear dynamics. Over a wide range of operating speeds, a contact ratio close to 2. 0 minimized dynamic load. For low <b>contact</b> ratio <b>gears</b> (<b>contact</b> ratio less than 2. 0), increasing the contact ratio reduced the gear dynamic load. For high <b>contact</b> ratio <b>gears</b> (<b>contact</b> ratio = or greater than 2. 0), the selection of contact ratio should take into consideration the intended operating speeds.

30|$|The {{electrical}} properties of self-assembled organic crystalline nanofibers are studied by integrating these on field-effect transistor platforms using both top and <b>bottom</b> <b>contact</b> configurations. In the staggered geometries, where the nanofibers are sandwiched between {{the gate and}} the source-drain electrodes, a better electrical conduction is observed {{when compared to the}} coplanar geometry where the nanofibers are placed over the gate and the source-drain electrodes. Qualitatively different output characteristics were observed for top and <b>bottom</b> <b>contact</b> devices reflecting the significantly different <b>contact</b> resistances. <b>Bottom</b> <b>contact</b> devices are dominated by contact effects, while the top contact device characteristics are determined by the nanofiber bulk properties. It is found that the contact resistance is lower for crystalline nanofibers when compared to amorphous thin films. These results shed light on the charge injection and transport properties for such organic nanostructures and thus constitute a significant step forward toward a nanofiber-based light-emitting device.|$|R

Significant differences were found in mean length of saithe between the periods of sampling, but for cod, capelin, haddock and Norwegian pout no significant change in mean length was found. A <b>bottom</b> <b>contact</b> sensor showed that the trawl had <b>bottom</b> <b>contact</b> several minutes {{both before and after the}} sampling period was defined.

40|$|Three {{aspects of}} a survey bottom trawl performance— 1) trawl {{geometry}} (i. e., net spread, door spread, and headrope height); 2) footrope distance off-bottom; and 3) bridle distance off-bottom—were compared among hauls by using either of two autotrawl systems (equal tension and net symmetry) and hauls conducted with towing cables of equal length and locked winches. The effects of environmental conditions, vessel heave, crabbing (i. e., the difference between vessel heading and actual vessel course over ground), and bottom current on trawl performance with three trawling modes were investigated. Means {{and standard deviations of}} trawl geometry measures were not significantly different between autotrawl and locked-winch systems. Bottom trawls performed better with either autotrawl system as compared to trawling with locked winches by reducing the variance and increasing the symmetry of the footrope <b>contact</b> with the <b>bottom.</b> The equal tension autotrawl system was most effective in counteracting effects of environmental conditions on footrope <b>bottom</b> <b>contact.</b> Footrope <b>bottom</b> <b>contact</b> was most inf luenced by environmental conditions during tows with locked winches. Both of the autotrawl systems also reduced the variance and increased the symmetry of bridle <b>bottom</b> <b>contact.</b> Autotrawl systems proved to be effective in decreasing the effects of environmental factors on some aspects of trawl performance and, as a result, have the potential to reduce among-haul variance in catchability of survey trawls.

The coplanar device geometry has a high contact resistance and consequently a poor conduction compared to the staggered geometries. Within the staggered geometries, the top contact geometry shows superior performance to the <b>bottom</b> <b>contact</b> geometry presumably due to a cleaner interface between the contact and the organic material and due to metal penetration into the organic material during contact deposition. The better electrical connection of the top contacts results in the nanofiber transistor output characteristics being dominated by the nanofiber bulk as opposed to the <b>bottom</b> <b>contact</b> devices which exhibit injection limited behavior. A direct comparison of the crystalline p 6 P nanofibers with amorphous thin films shows that both materials exhibit p-type behavior but the fibers conduct significantly better owing to their better crystallinity.|$|R

The net without a bag is operated in areas with a rough bottom and complicate configuration. In operating this net, factors which should be taken into consideration include the length of <b>bottom</b> <b>contact,</b> minimum distance between the net and artificial reef, and variation of net mouth. The net operation was analyzed through data from underwater camera and video, tension, depth, and net mouth height meters. The net mouth height at the time of <b>bottom</b> <b>contact</b> was 10 - 16 m. During hauling it decreased to 3 - 6 m. At the time of lift off the bottom, net mouth height ranged from 0. 5 - 1. 0 m.

Wing distance became narrow after lifting off the bottom. This caused schools of fishes which were in front of the net mouth to become frightened and entangled in the net bunt. Under operating conditions, the net mouth looked like a "tongue", and the phase of hauling like a scoop.
