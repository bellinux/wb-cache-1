5000|$|Some {{cover crops}} {{are used as}} {{so-called}} [...] "trap crops", to attract pests away from the crop of value and toward what the pest sees as a more favorable habitat (Shelton and Badenes-Perez 2006). Trap crop areas can be established within crops, within farms, or within landscapes. In many cases the trap crop is grown during the same season as the food crop being produced. The limited area occupied by these trap crops can be treated with a pesticide once pests {{are drawn to the}} trap in large enough numbers to reduce the pest populations. In some organic systems, farmers drive over the trap crop with a large vacuum-based implement to physically pull the pests off the plants and out of the field (Kuepper and Thomas 2002). This system has been recommended for use to help control the lygus bugs in organic strawberry production (Zalom et al. 2001). Another example of trap crops are nematode resistance White mustard (Sinapis alba) and Radish (Raphanus sativus). They can be grown after a main (cereal) crop and trap nematodes, for example the <b>beet</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> and Columbian root knot nematode. When grown, nematodes hatch and are attracted to the roots. After entering the roots they cannot reproduce in the root due to a hypersensitive resistance reaction of the plant. Hence the nematode population is greatly reduced, by 70-99%, depending on species and cultivation time.|$|E

The yellow <b>beet</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode,</b> _Heterodera betae_, is less prevalent but has also been found damaging beet crops. However, knowledge about the damage potential and population dynamics of the yellow <b>beet</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> is limited. The amount of damage inflicted by nematodes is dependent on different factors. An important factor influencing the sugar beet yield decline by beet cyst nematodes is the soil temperature. Relationships between soil temperature, _H. schachtii_ population densities and sugar beet yields have been reported previously. Until present, most studies have been conducted under constant temperatures. Since several studies have demonstrated that the population dynamics of many species are sensitive to small differences in temperature (1 - 4 0;C), we subjected in our pot experiment sugar beet plants (cultivar Monza) to 2 gradually increasing temperature regimes in separate climate chambers. Temperatures in the two climate chambers were increased from 8 0;C to 22 0;C and 12 0;C to 26 0;C, respectively.

Methodologies to assess the viability of their cysts which can contain 200 - 500 eggs protected by the hardened cuticle of a dead female, are either time and labor intensive, or lack robustness. We present a robust and cost-efficient viability assay based on loss of membrane integrity upon death. This assay uses trehalose, a disaccharide present at a high concentration in the perivitelline fluid of PCN eggs, as a viability marker. Although this assay can detect a single viable egg, the limit of detection for regular field samples was higher, ~ ten viable eggs, due to background signals produced by other soil components. On the basis of thirty non-viable PCN samples from The Netherlands, a threshold level was defined (¿Atrehalose= 0. 0094) below which the presence of more than ten viable eggs is highly unlikely (true for ~ 99. 7 % of the observations).

40|$|Around 1750 a German chemist {{discovered}} {{it to be}} possible to extract sugar crystals from beet juice. Since then, breeding and improved agricultural practices have increased the concentration of sucrose per root from around 4 % to around 18 %. Sugar content {{is still one of}} the most important characters in sugar beet breeding, but breeders of today are also faced with many more characters, many of a complex nature. The introduction of molecular marker techniques has added a very powerful tool to traditional breeding techniques. Through use of molecular markers it has become possible to breed with higher precision and with a higher degree of control. Molecular markers have also enabled complex traits to be dissected into some of their contributing factors. The studies included in the thesis have all been carried out for the purpose of finding and investigating the usefulness of molecular markers in sugar beet breeding. Large parts of the thesis is therefore concerned with describing how sugar beets are bred, how molecular markers can assist in this process and what should be taken account of in marker applications. The first three studies formed the basis for the use of markers in breeding applications, whereas the three studies thereafter are examples of marker applications. In study I, DNA sequences from a Beta vulgaris library were characterized to evaluate the usefulness of such sequences as markers in backcrossing and in comparative mapping. Since sugar beet is a crop of recent and narrow origin the variation within its breeding pool as compared with that of wild beets was of interest. This was investigated and found to be satisfactory in study II. A high-density RFLP linkage map of sugar beet was constructed in study III to create a basis for backcrossing and localisation of factors that influence important traits.

However, the molecular mechanisms mediating damage responses in plant–nematode interactions remain unexplored. Here, we characterized {{the role of a}} group of cell wall receptor proteins in Arabidopsis, designated as polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs), during infection with the <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> Heterodera schachtii and the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. PGIPs are encoded by a family of two genes in Arabidopsis, and are involved in the formation of active OG elicitors. Our results show that PGIP gene expression is strongly induced in response to <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> invasion of roots. Analyses of loss-of-function mutants and overexpression lines revealed that PGIP 1 expression attenuates infection of host roots by <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes,</b> but not root-knot nematodes. The PGIP 1 -mediated attenuation of <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> infection involves the activation of plant camalexin and indole-glucosinolate pathways. These combined results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant damage perception and response pathways during infection by <b>cyst</b> and root-knot <b>nematodes,</b> and establishes the function of PGIP in plant resistance to <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes...</b>|$|R
