50|$|Six {{different}} species of carnivores live in the Andes Mountain range. Three of these species are cats, the Andean cat, the pampas cat, and the puma. The puma is a large predator, while the Andean and Pampas Cat are medium-sized predators. These two medium-sized predators are very much alike. They both hunt within the same territory. They hunt the same prey, the mountain viscacha (Lagidium viscacia). The viscacha makes up 93.9% of the biomass consumed in the Andean cat's diet while the Pampas Cat depends on it for 74.8% of its <b>biomass</b> <b>consumption.</b> Both of these cats depend on a specific prey {{to make up a}} large portion of their dietary needs. In some areas, the mountain viscacha will make up 53% of the Andean cat's prey items. This is because the other prey items are so significantly smaller that even though the Andean cat will successfully hunt, kill, and eat a mountain viscacha half the time, the mountain viscacha is so much larger than the other food items, it makes up more substance. They also hunt frequently during the same periods. During one study, both the Andean cat and the Pampas Cat were seen most frequently during moonless nights; the second most sightings of these cats were during full moons. These two cats both hunt the same prey, making it more difficult for them to find food, essentially creating a race to find the prey before the other does.|$|E

40|$|The inverted-U shaped {{relationship}} between environment {{and economic growth}} has been well established in the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) literature for several local air pollutants, such as suspended particulate matter. Very few studies, however, tested the EKC relationship for <b>biomass</b> <b>consumption.</b> About 2. 5 billion people in developing nations depend on biomass fuels for household cooking and lighting. Most {{of these people are}} located in the rural areas and have lower income levels than national averages. Biomass fuels, although more easily accessible, are less efficient than other fuel types, and they cause adverse health impacts due to indoor air pollution. Within the households that use biomass fuels, women and children bear most of the health costs. This study employs panel data from 132 countries, from 1971 to 2004, in order to fulfil two aims: First, to test {{whether or not there is}} an EKC type {{relationship between}} <b>biomass</b> <b>consumption</b> and economic growth. Second, to investigate the impact of <b>biomass</b> <b>consumption</b> on household health, measured by life expectancy and infant mortality. We find a true EKC for <b>biomass</b> <b>consumption</b> with the turning – point occurring at a very low level of income per capita (US $ 119). After the turning point, it is hypothesised that countries switch to more efficient and less polluting fuel, and hence climb up on the ‘energy ladder’. Further panel data analysis reveals that <b>biomass</b> <b>consumption</b> (negatively) and income level (positively) affects the health status of a country. The results of the cross-sectional data analysis reveal whether or not an EKC type relationship can be found depends on the year of data and econometrics technique utilised. We find that panel data fixed effect estimation method is superior to the cross-sectional data ordinary least square method in establishing the EKC type relationship for <b>biomass</b> <b>consumption.</b> The results of the panel data analysis reported in this study reveal that developing countries cannot wait for economic growth to take place to reach the turning point as a policy solution. The problem of <b>biomass</b> <b>consumption</b> should be tackled at early stages of economic growth since the health benefits brought about by economic growth can be negated by adverse health effect of biomass use. We therefore recommend that developing countries should focus on economic policies on an energy limb to alternative sources of energy, such as solar thermal energy. Such policies would not only eliminate the negative impacts of <b>biomass</b> <b>consumption</b> on health, but also enable prevention of reliance on intermediate fuels such as fossil fuel, which have been found leading to global climate change. ...|$|E

Design of parabolic solar collector coverage (PSCC) for air heating for biomass drying in a special silo of the TEU is presented as well. Cost of HPC/ARHS is 10 times less than steel (USD 200 /ton vs. USD 2000 /ton, specific mass 2. 5 vs. 7. 6 g/cm 3, respectively). Those characteristics allow simultaneous solution of four ecological problems: large span coverage, rain water collection, daily solar energy collection and storage, and drying of biomass.

40|$|Abstract The {{response}} of vegetation distribution, carbon, and fire to three scenarios of future climate change was simulated for California using the MC 1 Dynamic General Vegetation Model. Under all three scenarios, Alpine/Subalpine Forest cover declined, {{and increases in}} the productivity of evergreen hardwoods led to the displacement of Evergreen Conifer Forest by Mixed Evergreen Forest. Grassland expanded, largely {{at the expense of}} Woodland and Shrubland, even under the cooler and less dry climate scenario where increased woody plant production was offset by increased wildfire. Increases in net primary productivity under the cooler and less dry scenario contributed to a simulated carbon sink of about 321 teragrams for California {{by the end of the}} century. Declines in net primary productivity under the two warmer and drier scenarios contributed to a net loss of carbon ranging from about 76 to 129 teragrams. Total annual area burned in California increased under all three scenarios, ranging from 9 – 15 % above the historical norm by the end of the century. Annual <b>biomass</b> <b>consumption</b> by fire by the end of the century was about 18 % greater than the historical norm under the more productive cooler and less dry scenario.

We examine the mechanisms permitting the coexistence of Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) and pastoral communities (Maldharis) in the Gir forests, India. We monitored six Maldhari settlements between 2005 and 2007 to quantify seasonal livestock holding, density and losses due to predation and other causes. Lion density, estimated by mark recapture, was 15 ± 0. 1 SE/ 100 km(2). Livestock density, estimated by total counts, ranged between 25 /km(2) - 31 /km(2) with buffaloes being most abundant. Average livestock holding of Maldhari families was 33 ± 3 SE. Lions predated mostly on unproductive cattle (30 %). Scat analysis (n = 165), predation events (n = 180) and seven continuous monitoring sessions of 1, 798 hours on four radio-collared lions estimated livestock to contribute between 25 to 42 % of lions' <b>biomass</b> <b>consumptions,</b> of which only 16 % was predated; rest scavenged. With free grazing rights within Gir forests, Maldharis offset 58 ± 0. 2 SE% of annual livestock rearing cost in comparison to non-forest dwelling pastoralists. With government compensation scheme for livestock predation, this profit margin augmented to 76 ± 0. 05 SE%. Lion density was higher in areas with Maldhari livestock in comparison to areas without livestock. Thus, the current lifestyles and livestock holdings of Maldharis seem to be beneficial to both lions and local pastoralists. We conclude {{that a combination of}} strict protection regime for lions, Maldharis' traditional reverence towards lions and the livelihood economics permit the delicate balance of lion-Maldhari coexistence. Indefinite increase in human and livestock population within Gir might upset this equilibrium undermining the conservation objectives. We see no end to compensation programs worldwide as they constitute a crucial element needed for human-carnivore coexistence...|$|R
