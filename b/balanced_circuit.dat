Design: Cost-effectiveness study {{embedded within a}} randomised controlled trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis. Participants: 162 rehabilitation inpatients from a metropolitan hospital in Sydney, Australia. Intervention: The experimental group received a 1 -hour standing <b>balance</b> <b>circuit</b> class, delivered {{three times a week}} for 2 weeks, in addition to usual therapy. The circuit classes were supervised by one physiotherapist and one physiotherapy assistant for up to eight patients. The control group received usual therapy alone. Outcome measures: Costs were estimated from routinely collected hospital use data in the 3 months after randomisation. The functional outcome measure was mobility measured at 3 months using the Short Physical Performance Battery administered by a blinded assessor. An incremental analysis was conducted and the joint probability distribution of costs and outcomes was examined using bootstrapping. Results: The median cost savings for the intervention group was AUD 4, 741 (95 % CI 137 to 9, 372) per participant; 94 % of bootstraps showed that the intervention was both effective and cost saving.
