40|$|Congenital {{heart block}} is an {{uncommon}} condition. Before 1920 only seven acceptable cases had been recorded. With the widespread introduction of clinical electrocardiography further examples were reported {{from all parts}} of the world and when Yater, Lyon and McNabb (1933) reviewed the subject they were able to collect 44 cases which satisfied their diagnostic criteria. Since then many more instances of congenital heart block have been recognized but, despite the increasing number of reports, few include anatomical and histological findings. In a recent survey of the subject Donoso, Braunwald, Jick and Grishman (1956) could find records of autopsies in only 17 instances, with adequate histological studies in seven. These seven cases are summarized in the accom-panying table together with an eighth case here reported. A further case (Wallgren and Winblad, 1937, Case 1) is also included although no E. C. G. is available and the criteria of Yater (1929) are therefore not fulfilled. However, there can be little doubt that the infant had congenital heart block (Table 1). Case Report Peter W. was born on May 8, 1957, weighing 6 lb. 1 oz. His mother had had one previous child and four mis-carriages. She had rheumatic heart disease and a past history of pulmonary tuberculosis. She had been well throughout the pregnancy. One of her brothers had died at the age of 6 months with congenital heart disease. The foetal heart rate was about 60 per minute before labour began. During labour the midwife recorded the same rate. The baby was born by breech delivery and showed <b>blue</b> <b>asphyxia.</b> He was given artificial respira-tion, oxygen and stimulants and recovered in about 20 minutes. Thereafter he became dyspnoeic and cyanosed during feeds. These symptoms became more marked and at the age of 2 days he was transferred to St. James ' Hospital, Leeds, under the care of Dr. E.
