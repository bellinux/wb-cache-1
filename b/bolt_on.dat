5|$|The MP 40 submachine {{guns are}} open-bolt, blowback-operated {{automatic}} arms. The only mode of fire was fully automatic, but {{the relatively low}} rate of fire enabled single shots with controlled trigger pulls. The bolt features a telescoping return spring guide {{which serves as a}} pneumatic recoil buffer. The cocking handle was permanently attached to the <b>bolt</b> <b>on</b> early MP 38s, but on late production MP 38s and MP 40s, the bolt handle was made as a separate part. It also served as a safety by pushing the head of handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening; this action locked the bolt either in the cocked (rear) or uncocked (forward) position. The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather harnesses with a small loop, used to hold the bolt in forward position.|$|E

On November 15, 2013, drummer Matt Cameron announced {{that he would not be}} touring with Soundgarden in 2014, due to prior commitments promoting Lightning <b>Bolt.</b> <b>On</b> December 13, 2013, the band announced an eleven-date European leg starting on June 16, 2014. In May 2014, the band announced a ten-date tour of the American Midwest starting on October 1, 2014, to coincide with two appearances at the Austin City Limits Music Festival. To conclude the tour, the band played at the annual Bridge School Benefit in Mountain View, California. In March 2015 the band announced a nine-date tour of Latin America, scheduled to start in November.|$|E
5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate held tight with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the screws and washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The handrail had a stripped <b>bolt</b> <b>on</b> the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the handrail, so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. The procedure was tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the handrail with Kapton tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on the handrail after removal.|$|E

The pair completed all {{tasks that}} were to be done, including installing two GPS antennas and deploying the Starboard 3 (S3) Payload Attach System (PAS), a new Rate Gyro Assembly (RGA) 2 and routing of Node 3 Avionics cables. The joint crew also completed more transfer, mostly transfer for return to earth in the MPLM and space shuttle mid-deck. The ISS crew also replaced a <b>bolt</b> <b>on</b> the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) so that the MPLM won't get stuck, and also to ensure correct capture of the HTV.|$|E
25|$|Shao Kahn and Darkseid {{are the key}} villains in the {{crossover}} game Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, {{though both}} are playable characters. In the game's plot, a defeated Shao Kahn limps into a graveyard where he meets with his secret ally Quan Chi. They are confronted by Raiden, who uses a lightning <b>bolt</b> <b>on</b> Shao Kahn, which knocks him into Quan Chi’s portal. This event, along with a parallel one between Superman and Darkseid in the DC Universe, results {{in the creation of}} Dark Kahn, who serves as the main antagonist in the game. After Dark Kahn is defeated, Shao Kahn ends up in the DC Universe's Darkseid's throne room, where he discovers he has lost his powers. He is promptly imprisoned in the Phantom Zone.|$|E
25|$|Anguilla is {{also the}} birthplace of {{sprinter}} Zharnel Hughes who has represented Great Britain since 2015. He specialises in the 100m and 200m sprints. He won the 100m in the 2013 CARIFTA Games {{with a time of}} 10.44 seconds, despite his time being some way below his personal best. He currently holds the ISSA/GraceKennedy Boys' and Girls' Athletics Championships record for the 100m, with a time of 10.12 seconds having taken the record from Yohan Blake. On 13 March 2015, Hughes made his Diamond League debut where he was commended for almost beating world champion Usain <b>Bolt.</b> <b>On</b> 24 July 2015, Hughes won the 200m at the London Diamond League meet {{to take the lead in}} the Diamond League standings for the season.

25|$|On flight day 9, Rick Mastracchio and Clay Anderson {{completed}} {{the third and}} final spacewalk of the STS-131 mission. Their tasks included hooking up the ammonia and nitrogen lines to the new Ammonia Tank Assembly (ATA), installing the old ATA in the shuttle's payload bay, retrieving some Micro-Meteoroid Orbital Debris (MMOD) shields, bolting a grapple bar (which had been removed from the old ATA) onto the new ATA, and preparation of some cables on the Z1 truss and tools to be used during STS-132. During the installation of the old ATA in Discoverys payload bay, the spacewalkers had some problems securing a <b>bolt</b> <b>on</b> the ATA to the LMC. The spacewalk took 6 hours and 24 minutes, bringing the total EVA time to 20 hours and 19 minutes. While the EVA was going on, commander Alan Poindexter and mission specialist Naoko Yamazaki continued transferring items from the MPLM to the ISS. Transfer is more than seventy-five percent complete.|$|E
25|$|Brake pads are {{available}} with numerous shapes and materials. Many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting, or brake shoe, with a post or <b>bolt</b> <b>on</b> the back to attach to the brake. Some are made as one piece with the attachment directly molded in the pad for lower production costs; brake pads of the cartridge type are {{held in place by}} a metal split pin or threaded grub screw and can be replaced without moving the brake shoe from its alignment to the rim. The rubber can be softer for more braking force with less lever effort, or harder for longer life. Many pad designs have a rectangular shape; others are longer and curved to match the radius of the rim. Larger pads do not necessarily provide more braking force, but will wear more slowly (in relation to thickness), so can usually be thinner. In general, a brake can be fitted with a variety of pads, as long as the mounting is compatible. Carbon fiber rims may be more sensitive to damage by incorrectly-matched brake pads, and generally must use non-abrasive cork pads.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} {{meeting of the}} 2011 IAAF Diamond League at Shanghai Golden Grand Prix, Powell won the 100m {{with a time of}} 9.95 seconds. Powell next ran at the IAAF Diamond League in Rome against Usain <b>Bolt</b> <b>on</b> 26 May. Powell had a superb start and mid but he faded towards the end, only to allow the world record holder to surpass him in the final 10–12m of the race. Bolt won in 9.91s and Powell came second in 9.93s. He said that he had lost focus, but is {{confident}} about beating Usain after what he had done that day. Powell next competed in the IAAF World Challenge in Rabat, Morocco, in a low key meet. There, after running the first 20m, he pulled up and finished last in 36.13s, citing a precaution against a serious hamstring injury. Reports said that it was nothing serious and he would be ready for the Jamaican Trials later in the month. At the Jamaican Trials 23–24 July, Powell looked impressive as he qualified through the rounds. He posted a season best of 9.90s in his semi-final, despite easing off in the final 15m. Later, after overcoming a bad start, Powell won the final to be titled National Champion for the fifth time in his career. He won in a time of 10.08s into a 1.8m/s headwind. Yohan Blake and Steve Mullings were second and third respectively with 0.01s separating them.|$|E

25|$|After {{witnessing}} {{the death of}} Conquering Bear at the Grattan massacre, Crazy Horse began to get trance visions. Curly went out on a vision quest to seek guidance but without going through the traditional procedures first. In his vision, a warrior on his horse rode out of a lake and the horse seemed to float and dance throughout the vision. He wore simple clothing, no face paint, his hair down with just a feather in it, and a small brown stone behind his ear. Bullets and arrows flew around him as he charged forward, but {{neither he nor his}} horse were hit. A thunderstorm came over the warrior, and his people grabbed hold of his arms trying to hold him back. The warrior broke their hold and then lightning struck him, leaving a lightning symbol on his cheek, and white marks like hailstones appeared on his body. The warrior told Curly that as long he dressed modestly, his tribesmen did not touch him, and he did not take any scalps or war trophies, then he would not be harmed in battle. As the vision ended, he heard a red-tailed hawk shrieking off in the distance. Curly’s father later interpreted the vision and said that the warrior was going to be him. The lightning <b>bolt</b> <b>on</b> his cheek and the hailstones on his body were to become his war paint. Curly was to follow the warrior’s role to dress modestly and to do as the warrior's prophecy said so he would be unharmed in battle. For the most part, the vision was true and Crazy Horse was rarely harmed in battle, except for when he was struck by an arrow after taking two enemy scalps. He was shot in the face by No Water when Little Big Man tried to hold Crazy Horse back to prevent a fight from breaking out, and he was held back by one of his tribesmen—according to some reports, Little Big Man himself—when he was stabbed by a bayonet the night he died.|$|E
