Her anger arises from the {{enslavement}} of her city and the hurt done to her loved ones, but also from her mixed heritage: in anger she often refers to herself in derogatory terms such as [...] "half-breed". Her hatred prevents her from engaging with the Alds in any way: she continually refers {{to them in a}} negative manner, and when it is suggested that she attend Orrec's performance for the Gand, is initially reluctant <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> nothing to do with them.

500|$|The {{central theme}} in Prometheus {{concerns}} the eponymous Titan of Greek mythology who defies {{the gods and}} gifts humanity with fire, {{for which he is}} subjected to eternal punishment. The gods want to limit their creations in case they attempt to usurp the gods. The film deals with humanity's relationship with the gods—their creators—and the consequence of defying them. A human expedition intends to find God and receive knowledge about belief, immortality and death. They find superior beings who appear god-like in comparison to humanity, and the Prometheus crew suffer consequences for their pursuit. Shaw is directly responsible for the events of the plot <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> her religious beliefs affirmed, and believes she is entitled to answers from God; her questions remain unanswered and she is punished for her hubris. The film offers similar resolution, providing items of information but leaving the connections and conclusions to the audience, potentially leaving the question unanswered. Further religious allusions are implied by the Engineers' decision to punish humanity with destruction 2,000 years before the events of the film. Scott suggested that an Engineer was sent to Earth to stop humanity's increasing aggression, but was crucified, implying it was Jesus Christ. However, Scott felt that an explicit connection in the film would be [...] "a little too on the nose." ...|$|E
