5|$|In the mid-2000s, German sect experts {{expressed}} concerns that Scientologists were becoming {{active in the}} German after-school tutoring market. These concerns arose because customers of around 20 after-school tutoring centres operated by Scientologists in Frankfurt, Hamburg, Stuttgart and elsewhere might <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> that their children were being taught by Scientologists, using Scientology methods. Brochures advertising the tutoring services would at most mention the name of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, but not Scientology itself.|$|E
5|$|Many HIV-positive {{people are}} unaware {{that they are}} {{infected}} with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E

5|$|The annual {{incidence}} in Canada of genital herpes due to HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection {{is not known}} (for a review of HSV-1/HSV-2 prevalence and incidence studies worldwide, see Smith and Robinson 2002). As many as one in seven Canadians aged 14 to 59 may be infected with herpes simplex type 2 virus and more than 90 per cent of them may <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> of their status, a new study suggests. In the United States, {{it is estimated that}} about 1,640,000 HSV-2 seroconversions occur yearly (730,000 men and 910,000 women, or 8.4 per 1,000 persons).|$|E
5|$|The {{families}} {{of individuals who}} have inherited or {{are at risk of}} inheriting HD have generations of experience of HD, but may <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> of recent breakthroughs in understanding the disease, and of the availability of genetic testing. Genetic counseling benefits these individuals by updating their knowledge, seeking to dispel any unfounded beliefs that they may have, and helping them consider their future options and plans. Also covered is information concerning family planning choices, care management, and other considerations.|$|E
5|$|A 2005 {{survey found}} that 68% of American flex-fuel car owners were not aware they owned an E85 flex. This was because the exteriors of flex and non-flex {{vehicles}} look exactly the same; there is no sale price difference between them; the lack of consumers' awareness about E85s; and also the initial decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling, so buyers could <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> they are purchasing an E85 vehicle. Since 2008, all new FFV models in the US feature a bright yellow gas cap to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities and proper flex-fuel badging.|$|E

5|$|Many {{people with}} TS {{may not realize}} they have tics; because tics are more {{commonly}} expressed in private, TS may go unrecognized or undetected. It {{is not uncommon for}} the parents of affected children to <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> that they, too, may have had tics as children. Because Tourette's tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now more likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not uncommon for several members of a family to be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they, too, had tics as a child.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen sulfide is {{a highly}} toxic and {{flammable}} gas (flammable range: 4.3–46%). Being heavier than air, it tends to accumulate {{at the bottom of}} poorly ventilated spaces. Although very pungent at first, it quickly deadens the sense of smell, so victims may <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> of its presence until it is too late.

25|$|Younger {{women with}} {{an age of}} less than 40 years or women over 80 years {{tend to have a}} poorer {{prognosis}} than post-menopausal women due to several factors. Their breasts may change with their menstrual cycles, they may be nursing infants, and they may <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> of changes in their breasts. Therefore, younger women are usually at a more advanced stage when diagnosed. There may also be biologic factors contributing to a higher risk of disease recurrence for younger women with breast cancer.|$|E
