5|$|In November 2015, China {{became the}} first export {{customer}} for the Su-35 when the Russian and Chinese governments signed a contract worth $2billion {{for the purchase of}} 24aircraft for the People's Liberation Army Air Force. Although Chinese officials had first shown interest in the modernized Su-35 design in 2006, it was not until 2010 when Rosoboronexport, the Russian state agency responsible for the export and import of defence products, was ready to start talks with the Chinese government on the sale of the Su-35. Russian officials publicly confirmed that talks had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> 2012, when a protocol agreement on the purchase of the aircraft was signed. There were subsequent media reports and official remarks that the two countries had signed a contract and deliveries of the aircraft were imminent, but negotiations would not actually conclude until 2015.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the emperor}} Nicholas I, Konstantin {{maintained}} {{his position in}} Poland. Differences soon arose {{between him and his}} brother, in consequence of the part taken by the Poles in the Decembrist conspiracy. Konstantin hindered the unveiling of the organized plotting for independence which had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> Poland for many years, and held obstinately to the belief that the army and the bureaucracy were loyally devoted to the Russian empire. The eastern policy of the Tsar and the Turkish War of 1828 and 1829 caused a fresh breach between them. It was due to the opposition of Konstantin that the Polish army took no part in this war.|$|E

500|$|Matt Norris of Cinema Blend {{stated that}} most of the events portrayed in the episode were unexpected, {{including}} Dualla's suicide, Starbuck finding her own supposed body, discovering the thirteenth tribe were Cylons, and that Ellen Tigh is the final model, but still thought the episode was among the top five Battlestar Galactica episodes in its run. Marc Bernardin of Entertainment Weekly stated that a lot had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the episode, but criticised the writers' decision of having Ellen as the fifth Cylon. While Dualla's suicide was surprising for Bernardin, he was critical about the Adama scene after her suicide, stating it as [...] "some of Olmos' worst acting in the series", and that the answered questions for the episode raised more questions, but felt the episode was good overall. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger commented: [...] "What really grabs me about the show (as I discussed in today's column) is its humanity, the way its characters react to situations the way you imagine real, contemporary people might" [...] and felt that [...] "as the stakes for the characters has risen, so has the intensity of [...] performances," [...] with even the extras in character. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune praised Nankin's directing, particularly [...] "the moment in which we see Kara Thrace, silhouetted in black against a dark blue sky, preparing to burn “her” body—that’s sent a shiver down my spine. That was just such a beautifully operatic image, spot-on in tone and perfectly executed." ...|$|E
500|$|Three days later, it was {{reported}} that Marvel was looking at Alan Taylor and Daniel Minahan as prospective directors to replace Jenkins, and were also in the midst of hiring a writer to rewrite Don Payne's script, with the shortlist of possible writers consisting of John Collee, Robert Rodat, and Roger Avary. At the end of the month, Alan Taylor, best known for directing episodes of the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones, was chosen to direct the sequel. Feige mentioned Taylor's work on the series Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones as reasons for his hiring, saying [...] "With Alan's direction we got a few more layers of patina, of texture, of reality into our golden realm." [...] By January 10, Marvel Studios had commissioned screenwriter Robert Rodat to rewrite the sequel and Hiddleston stated that filming was expected to begin in London in the summer of 2012. Hemsworth later confirmed that filming was scheduled to begin in August. Hemsworth also revealed that the film would have a more Viking-influenced feel, elaborating [...] "I think the science fiction element to Thor… the danger is it falls a little bit into the world of it's 'tough to throw a light to.' I think of big waterfalls and mountains and a Viking influence, where the Norse mythology kind of grew from. Having that in Asgard {{is going to make it}} all the more special and that's what Alan [...] wants to bring to it." [...] Feige said [...] "while the relationship between Loki and Thor certainly has changed [...] and has progressed, a lot of Thor 2 is picking up where it left off in terms of Jane, who you just saw for a moment on a computer monitor, and also what's <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the nine realms without the Asgardians being able to use the Bifrost."

2500|$|Although Norwood {{received}} a sole writing credit on album cut [...] "Finally" [...] only, she noted Afrodisiac the most honest effort {{of her career}} yet based on its deeply autobiographical content, commenting: [...] "Everything I do {{has something to do}} with what I've gone through in my life [...] I definitely wanted to incorporate that in my art. It makes it more real when you add what's <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> your life in your music. I've grown and I've gone through some things in my life, and I celebrate that, I honor that." [...] Soundwise, her collaboration with Timbaland, recent motherhood, life experiences, and growing affinity toward alternative music such as Coldplay, caused Norwood to shift toward a more matured outlook and raw nature with the album, a venture into the organic sounds of soul blues, ambient music, and the nostalgic street-wise sound of 1990’s hip-hop.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, {{allegations}} {{emerged that}} a large number of Falun Gong practitioners had been killed to supply China's organ transplant industry. An initial investigation found that [...] "the source of 41,500 transplants for the six year period 2000 to 2005 is unexplained" [...] and concluded that [...] "there has been and continues today to be large scale organ seizures from unwilling Falun Gong practitioners". Ethan Gutmann estimates 65,000 Falun Gong practitioners were killed for their organs from 2000 to 2008. Following additional analysis, the researchers significantly raised the estimates on the number of Falun Gong practitioners who may have been targeted for organ harvesting. In 2008 United Nations Special Rapporteurs reiterated their requests for [...] "the Chinese government to fully explain the allegation of taking vital organs from Falun Gong practitioners and the source of organs for the sudden increase in organ transplants that has <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> China since the year 2000".|$|E
2500|$|The {{long-term}} {{implications of}} the battle of Adrianople for the art of war have often been overstated, with many 20th-century writers repeating Sir Charles Oman's idea that the battle represented a turning point in military history, with heavy cavalry triumphing over Roman infantry and ushering {{in the age of the}} Medieval knight. [...] This idea was overturned by T.S Burns in 1973. Burns shows that the Gothic army's cavalry arm was fairly small, that Valens would actually have had more cavalry and that while the role of Fritigern's cavalry was critical to his victory, the battle was a mainly infantry versus infantry affair. The Medieval knight was not to rise for several centuries after Adrianople. It is also often stated that the defeat at Adrianople led to changes in the composition of the late Roman Army and an increase in the use of cavalry. In fact, this process had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the Roman Army long before AD 378, with cavalry increasing its role and status in the Army from at least the time of the Emperor Gallienus (AD 253 to 260).|$|E
