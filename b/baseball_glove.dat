2500|$|By mid-August, Nashville was in third-place behind Evansville and the Atlanta Crackers.

2500|$|Trapper: This goalie's {{catching}} glove {{was originally}} shaped {{in the same}} fashion as a <b>baseball</b> <b>glove.</b> [...] It has evolved into a highly specific piece of equipment that is designed specifically for catching the puck. Some of the more significant changes are the use of a [...] "string mesh" [...] in the pocket of the trapper and the substantial palm and wrist protection. The pocket is the area between the thumb and first finger of the glove and is where most goaltenders try to catch the puck; catching in the pocket reduces the chance of a rebound falling out of the glove. The trapper must not be more than 18 inches across. The trapper can be held in a variety of positions depending upon the individual goaltender, but the trend among younger goaltenders is to hold the glove with the palm facing towards the shooter, instead of the [...] "shake hands" [...] position that was popular previously. The [...] "Cheater" [...] portion of the glove is the portion of the glove on the outside area of the thumb and the part that covers the wrist of the goaltender.|$|E

Later, Holden agrees to write an English composition for his roommate, Ward Stradlater, who is leaving for a date. [...] However, Holden is distressed to learn that Stradlater's date is an old friend, Jane Gallagher, whom Holden had a crush on and feels protective of. That night, Holden goes to a Cary Grant comedy with his best friend Mal Brossman and Ackley. While Ackley and Mal enjoy the film, Holden becomes uneasy with it. When Stradlater returns hours later, he fails to appreciate the deeply personal composition Holden wrote for him about the <b>baseball</b> <b>glove</b> of Holden's late brother Allie, and refuses to reveal whether he slept with Jane. [...] Enraged, Holden punches him, and Stradlater easily wins the ensuing fight. When Holden continues insulting him after the fight, Stradlater knocks him unconscious and nearly kills him. After leaving for Ackley's room, Holden is disappointed when he treats him rudely. Fed up with the so-called [...] "phonies" [...] at Pencey Prep, Holden impulsively decides to leave Pencey early, sells his typewriter to earn money, and catches a train to Penn Station in New York. Holden intends stay away from his home in a hotel until Wednesday, when his parents would have received news of his expulsion. Aboard the train, Holden meets the mother of a wealthy, obnoxious Pencey student named Ernest Morrow, and lies to her about himself and her son.|$|E
