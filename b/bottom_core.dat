In the South China Sea, she dredged the bottom in the vicinity of Seahorse Shoal and her scuba divers examined the peak of the seamount there for 30 minutes and took color photographs of it. Off Jesselton, she observed an oceanographic station and took a <b>bottom</b> <b>core</b> sample and deep-sea photographs. During her voyage from Singapore to Calcutta, she investigated the waters around the Andaman Islands, Nicobar Islands, and Langkawi islands and along {{the west side of the}} Malay Peninsula, employing her geological echo profiler (GEP) and gathering data on the sea bottom via core samples and dredging, and she examined the Ganges Canyon, the Trincomalee Canyon, and several undersea channels she crossed while running a track line from Little Andaman Island to the east coast of Ceylon. While proceeding from Colombo to Penang, she investigated the waters north of Sumatra and an undersea canyon south of Sumatra near the Sunda Strait. During the Djakarta-to-Palau leg of her trip, she investigated the waters of Lombok Strait, ran a track line from Lombok Strait across the Java Sea, through Makassar Strait, and across the Celebes Sea, and collected a 16½-foot (5-meter) <b>bottom</b> <b>core</b> sample from the Mindanao Trench. She also made a GEP profile along the northern and eastern sides of and across the Palau Trench, and she collected dredging samples from its western and eastern slopes. While en route Guam from Palau, she collected a 13-foot (4-meter) <b>bottom</b> <b>core</b> sample from the Mariana Trench and made a GEP profile and took bottom samples west of Guam. On the final leg of the expedition, she made a track line from Guam to Honolulu, discovering nine seamounts along the way, the largest of which rose to 3,960 feet (1,207 meters) below the surface in waters with a general depth of 18,000 feet (5,486 meters) about 200 nautical miles (370 km) south of Wake Island.|$|E

The innermost core is more homogeneous,essentially authochthonous and dominated by "cave species"while the cores near the entrance of the cave are more heterogeneous and contaminated by external bioclasts. These difference indicate a confinement gradient mainly affected by hydrodynamics. Conversely,radiometric data indicate few signs of temporal variations,at least for the last 1, 000 years recorded in the sediments studied.

40|$|Recently {{the control}} of the shape in the {{production}} of nanoparticles has become a new and interesting research area. In fact it has been demonstrated that physical properties are strongly related to the nanoparticles shapes. Hence non-spherical metallic nanoparticles such as silver nanorods [1], nanodisks [2], triangular particles [3] and gold nanorods [4] show anisotropic optical properties. In the same way, it was shown that the optical properties of semiconductor particles [5 { 7] and the magnetization properties of magnetic particles [8, 9] are drastically aected by their shapes. Shape controlled BaCrO 4 nanoparticles have been synthesized in reverse micelles [10].

The pore water pressure, earth pressure, settlement and failure behaviors according to several reinforcing method were compared and analyzed. The pore water pressure showed a small change in the spillway transition zone and core, indicating that the riprap and geotextile efficiently reinforced the embankment, but non-reinforcement showed a largely change in pore water pressure. The earth pressure by riprap and geotextile at upstream slope and <b>bottom</b> <b>core</b> increased rapidly with the infiltration of the pore water by overtopping. And the earth pressure at crest showed a smally change due to effect of the inclined core. A settlement by riprap showed a small change and the geotextile decreased a rapidly due to failure of crest.

40|$|AbstractClimatic {{changes are}} {{reflected}} in variations of different parameters. Sequences of lake sediments are good sources of this information because they provide continuous and detailed records of palaeoclimatic changes. In {{order to determine the}} changes in climate in SE Pampas plain, in this paper we present a series of rock magnetic studies performed on a <b>bottom</b> <b>core</b> collected from Lake La Brava (Argentina). In order to establish lake level variations, we also measure total sulphur, organic and inorganic carbon (TS, TOC and TIC) content, alkaline elements, light and heavy metals and changes in vegetation communities. Five radiocarbon age determinations were made from samples of organic-rich clay and calibrated ages were calculated. The averaged sediment accumulation rate is 1. 3 mm/yr and the sequence represents a temporal extent of about 4800 calibrated years before the present (cal. BP). The main aim was to reconstruct the hydrological balance of the lake, the changes in erosional strength and sediment supply within the catchment area since the Middle Holocene, and to explore {{the extent to which these}} may be linked to changes in climate and/or human activities. The results of this work and previous studies suggest periodic changes from cooler to warmer and humid conditions. Relationships between submerged and emergent plants are consistent with the behaviour of magnetic susceptibility. TOC changes suggest wet environment during magnetic enhancement.

40|$|Hydrocarbon {{pollution}} {{is one of}} the most serious problems facing many developed and developing countries, including Malaysia. Aliphatic hydrocarbons comprising straight chain carbons are class of hydrocarbon pollution indices in the environment of anthropogenic and natural origins. To identify the historical trend of development, sediment samples were collected using a gravity corer from the narrow waterway of Johor Strait in the southern part of Peninsular Malaysia. The core samples were soxhlet extracted, purified and fractionated using 2 -step column chromatography followed by instrumental analysis with Gas Chromatograph Flame Ionization Detector. The results showed that the hydrocarbon contamination followed 4 distinct patterns. The pre-war period or at the onset of industrial development has seen a minimum input of alkanes. The World War II and postwar period (1945 - 1960) saw a decrease in hydrocarbon contamination because of the significant reduction in oil transportation. The third phase (1960 - 1990) saw a rapid increase in hydrocarbon input due to rapid economic development, industrialization and motorization and human population growth. The 4 th phase (1990 -present) saw a trend toward decreasing contamination due to strict environmental regulations (1990 - 2005). Surface aliphatic hydrocarbon concentration may have resulted from port operations, shipping activities and accidental spills. Total alkane concentration for the surface, middle and <b>bottom</b> <b>core</b> were 3180, 835 and 263 μgg(- 1) dry weight, respectively.

The same characteristics prevailed for the clayey Unit 5 of Turonian to Albian age. Strictly reducing environments existed for black facies along Unit 6 of earliest Albian to Late Jurassic age and allowed the preservation of a rich organic material that is marine in origin.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), microanalysis by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) together with investigations by back-scattered electron mode (SEM-BSE), and powder X-Ray diffraction (XRD) allowed: 1) defining the primary sample lithology; 2) examining the features of both primary and secondary minerals; 3) describing the relationships among texture and secondary mineralization.

The objectives and the contributions of this thesis consist of development of mathematical algorithms and techniques for mapping and transferring FE data (stresses, strains, displacements, etc.) from macro-to-macro and micro-to-macro FE models among different FE solvers and meshes. All these features have been implemented into a new finite element data exchange system (FEDES). FEDES has been developed to simulate manufacturing chains by using FE techniques. Extensive research {{has been carried out}} on the simulation of investment casting processes of aero-engine parts under equiaxed and directional cooling. Methodologies for predicting the component life undergoing low cycle fatigue (LCF) and high cycle fatigue (HCF) have been developed. Life prediction based on the effect of the residual stresses obtained from micro machining and shot-peening processes has been investigated. FEDES has been used to simulate two manufacturing chains where the residual stresses and the distortions after each manufacturing process have been passed to the next process of the chain. Manufacturing chain simulation including casting, forging and heat treatment has been carried out on a simple parallelepiped geometry. A second manufacturing chain simulation has been performed on an aero-engine vane component which includes the following manufacturing processes: metal deposition, welding, heat treatment, machining and shot-peening. An investment casting simulation under equiaxed cooling of the <b>bottom</b> <b>core</b> vane (BCV) component of the aero-engines vane has been performed.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Magnetic, {{gravity and}} {{bathymetry}} {{data were collected}} on an extended cruise of the R/V Yaquina in 1969. The last set of data was obtained from those track lines leaving the Panama Basin. The area covered is mainly the Cocos plate (Molnar and Sykes, 1969). The data is analyzed and compared with results of previous workers and the geophysical implications considered. Generally speaking, from the magnetic part of the data, both direct and indirect methods show support of Vine and Matthew's (1963) hypothesis of sea-floor spreading and the subsequent principles of new global tectonics. The most northern magnetic anomaly profile across the East Pacific rise (at 18. 3 °N) shows a spreading rate about 3 cm/yr. and the most southern one (at 12. 8 °N) shows a rate about 5. 2 cm/yr. The Cocos plate has been assumed to move in a northeast-southwest direction (N 30 °E to N 45 °E), and rotate {{with respect to the}} Pacific plate about a pole at 40 °N, 110 °W with an angular velocity of 19. 6 x 10 ⁻⁷ deg. /yr. (Larson and Chase, 1970). New material comes up from the west boundary - the East Pacific rise, and the south boundary - the Galapogos rift, causing the Cocos plate to underthrust the Americans plate at the middle American arc. Some of the points of new global tectonics can not be detected from this set of data; further detailed study of more track lines and sea <b>bottom</b> <b>core</b> samples are needed. The results of both analytical methods for determining the magnitude of induced and remanent magnetization in the second layer shows some consistence with the work of Schaeffer and Schwarz (1970), and Irving et al. (1970) at the Mid-Atlantic ridge near 45 °N, in which a thinner magnetization layer at the ridge and the attenuation of magnetization intensity away from the ridge axis are suggested. Free-air gravity anomaly profiles have been employed to determine the crustal structure of two sections 1 a ridge section at 12. 8 °N and a trench section at 14 °N. For the ridge section, if the anomalous mantle was converted from normal mantle, the extension of anomalous mantle into the normal mantle requires some uplift and/or lateral expansion in the rise crest area. The tensional configuration suggested in the trench crustal section agrees with the model proposed by Elsasser (1968) for the differential movement between two lithospheric blocks. This work gives some speculations that evidence which supports the present new global tectonics theory is limited to a certain degree of accuracy. Further study of the theory based upon physics, its mechanism, and measurement techniques that would give more reliable evidence have to be developed before it can be ascertained what really happens beneath this wild, wild world...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the crisis}} in 2008 {{affected}} the global financial market, the economic climate changed drastically. A {{significant increase in the}} amount of vacant office buildings was introduced. Combining this fact with the increasing demand for living space in urban areas, transformation of vacant office buildings to residential buildings seems to be a simple solution to the problem. Redevelopment and transformation of vacant office buildings experience however many obstacles. Research into the structural opportunities of vacant office buildings could be helpful to overcome several obstacles. Due to the complexity of the projects, transformation asks involvement of many parties in an early stage of the development. The developers consult several advisors on financial, structural and architectural aspects. The aim of this research is creating a better understanding of transformation possibilities, emphasizing on the structural modifications of the transformation plan. The investigation answers the main research objective; the influence of the structural possibilities on the transition point between demolishing and transforming multi-story concrete office buildings. The building structures within this research exist of reinforced concrete and are built between 1950 and 1980. The transformation plan changes the office building function to residential function. An assessment tool is composed during the design study and consists of general- and structural selection criteria. This assessment tool is used to obtain a good and comprehensive understanding of the transformation potential. If the buildings have passed the veto criteria ((1) demand for housing and (2) the environmental regulations), they have been examined to the general selection criteria. If the results are below 50 % of the maximum achievable score, the building is not suitable for any further investigation. These buildings are omitted in the next step; the selection criteria of the structural aspects. The aim of this intermediate examination step is to gain a better view on the structural aspects of the potentiometer. Eight potential projects have passed the selection criteria and have been clustered in three groups; low-, medium- and high transformation potential. Two buildings have been chosen for further investigation during the design study; the Shell-building and Cool 75, both located in the center of Rotterdam. The architectural design and the corresponding structural modifications have been analyzed on their feasibility. The results of the investigated case study projects correspond with the outcome of the selection criteria. Important structural aspects of successful transformation projects are the availability of original information, the possibility to attach balconies to the current structure and vertical expansion. Other important influences on the transition point between demolition and transformation of the existing office building structure are the free floor height and the installation of ducts in horizontal and vertical direction. The adjustability and flexibility of the structural layout are remaining important factors, flexible floor plans enlarge the feasibility when a change of function is investigated. The strength and stability of the existing structure with the implemented change of function have to be checked on the structural key factors; (1) the horizontal deformation at the top, (2) the shear forces in the normative lintels, (3) the axial forces on the foundation piles and (4) the compressive and tensile stresses of the stabilizing elements. The structural key factors are applicable for a larger range of similar building structures. If the structural key factors fulfill the requirements according the Eurocode, the structural performances of the existing structure on vertical expansion, attachment of balconies and other possible structural modifications have to be investigated. If the structural key factors do not fulfill the requirements, there has to be looked into the integration of required structural modifications which also lead to an increase of the architectural and economic value of the building. The maximum wind load exposure according Eurocode 1 - 4 is significantly higher for tall buildings than the TGB 1955. The wind loads have a large influence on the bending moment {{at the bottom of the}} core and the horizontal displacement at the top of the tower. The Shell-building shows an increase in <b>bottom</b> <b>core</b> moments of ± 50 % in SLS and ± 25 % in ULS. The increment of the wind loads is an important factor to the structural performances of office buildings with an equivalent height. The wind load of low-rise buildings is not significantly increased. An important aspect on the transition point is the relation between the structural modifications and the economic revenues of the structural modifications. To determine the transition point between demolishing or transforming an office building, the structural modifications should be justified on economic reasoning. Due to the comprehensive field within the transformation market of office buildings, not every design and feasibility aspect is considered during this investigation. More research needs be done on the structural performances and visual assessment of the case study projects. Furthermore, not all non-structural transformation motives have been taken into consideration. These aspects are open for further investigation.
