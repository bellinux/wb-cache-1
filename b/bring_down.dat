5|$|Following this {{declaration}} by the Dean, {{demolition of}} {{the remains of the}} old cathedral began in 1668.

Like many experimental techniques, the use of gunpowder was not easy to control; several workers were killed and nearby residents complained about noise and damage. Eventually, Wren resorted to using a battering ram instead. Building work on the new cathedral began in June 1675.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} in the post-medieval period, the tower was {{deliberately}} damaged to put it beyond military use, a process called slighting. This probably occurred {{towards the end of the}} English Civil War, after the defeat of the Royalist forces in Kent at the Battle of Maidstone. The tower was then owned by Sir John Rayney of Wrotham Place, a Royalist, and would have been an effective lookout tower in any future conflict. There appears to have been an attempt to <b>bring</b> <b>down</b> the whole tower by damaging the stair turret at its base, possibly using gunpowder, which failed due to the spiral staircase's unusually strong design. After this the upper storey of the tower was carefully removed instead, leaving the building roofless.|$|E
