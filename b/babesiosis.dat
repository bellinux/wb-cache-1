5|$|Rodents {{are also}} {{significant}} vectors of disease. The black rat, with the fleas that it carries, plays a primary role in spreading the bacterium Yersinia pestis responsible for bubonic plague, and carries the organisms responsible for typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis. A number of rodents carry hantaviruses, including the Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses, which can infect humans. Rodents {{also help to}} transmit diseases including <b>babesiosis,</b> cutaneous leishmaniasis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Powassan virus, rickettsialpox, relapsing fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and West Nile virus.|$|E
5|$|Ticks are {{implicated in}} the {{transmission}} {{of a number of}} infections caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses and protozoa. Sometimes the tick harbours more than one type of pathogen, making diagnosis of the infection more difficult. Species of the bacterium Rickettsia are responsible for typhus, rickettsialpox, Boutonneuse fever, African tick bite fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Flinders Island spotted fever and Queensland tick typhus (Australian tick typhus). Other tick-borne diseases include Lyme disease and Q fever, Colorado tick fever, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, tularemia, tick-borne relapsing fever, <b>babesiosis,</b> ehrlichiosis, Bourbon virus and tick-borne meningoencephalitis, as well as bovine anaplasmosis and probably the Heartland virus.|$|E
25|$|Ticks that {{transmit}} B. burgdorferi {{to humans}} can also carry and transmit several other parasites, such as Theileria microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, which cause the diseases <b>babesiosis</b> and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), respectively. Among early Lyme disease patients, {{depending on their}} location, 2–12% will also have HGA and 2–40% will have <b>babesiosis.</b> Ticks in certain regions, including the lands along the eastern Baltic Sea, also transmit tick-borne encephalitis.|$|E
25|$|Human {{diseases}} {{transmitted by}} microtine rodents include cystic hydatid disease, tularemia, bubonic plague, <b>babesiosis,</b> giardiasis and the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi.|$|E
25|$|Ticks* are an {{external}} parasite {{of the dog}} and can spread diseases such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, <b>babesiosis,</b> and ehrlichiosis. They can also cause a neurological disorder known as tick paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Babesiosis* {{is spread}} {{by members of}} the family Ixodidae, or hard ticks. The two species of the genus Babesia that affect dogs are B. canis and B. gibsoni. <b>Babesiosis</b> can cause {{hemolytic}} anemia in dogs.|$|E
25|$|For early cases, prompt {{treatment}} is usually curative. However, the severity {{and treatment of}} Lyme disease may be complicated due to late diagnosis, failure of antibiotic treatment, and simultaneous infection with other tick-borne diseases (coinfections), including ehrlichiosis, <b>babesiosis,</b> and immune suppression in the patient.|$|E
25|$|Tick bites - <b>Babesiosis</b> {{is a rare}} tickborne infection. Patients {{should check}} {{themselves}} or have themselves inspected for tick bites {{if they are in}} an at-risk situation. Presentation with fever, fatigue, and haemolytic anaemia requires diagnostic confirmation by identifying the parasites within red blood cells on blood film and by specific serology. Quinine (with or without clindamycin) is usually an effective treatment.|$|E
25|$|Nabeg’s sons {{include the}} stallions *Menes, *Pesniar, and *Nariadni, all three {{imported}} to the U.S. Peleng, another son, was sold for $3.2 million but {{tested positive for}} piroplasmosis (Equine <b>babesiosis)</b> and was never permitted to enter the U.S. Nabeg {{can also be found}} in Trakehner pedigrees through some of his sons and daughters. Unfortunately Nabeg died young, having left only eight foal crops.|$|E
25|$|Some {{parasitic}} forms affect {{humans and}} other mammals, causing damage by their feeding, {{and can even}} be vectors of diseases, such as scrub typhus, rickettsialpox, Lyme disease, Q fever, Colorado tick fever, tularemia, tick-borne relapsing fever, <b>babesiosis,</b> ehrlichiosis and tick-borne meningoencephalitis. A well known effect of mites on humans is their role as an allergen and the stimulation of asthma in people affected by respiratory disease.|$|E
25|$|In Western Australia at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, east Kimberley cattlemen were looking for a way to traverse the western deserts of Australia with their cattle as a way to break a west Kimberley monopoly that controlled the supply of beef to Perth and the goldfields in the south of the state. East Kimberley cattle were infested with Boophilus ticks infected with a malaria-like parasitic disease called <b>Babesiosis</b> and were prohibited from being transported to southern markets by sea due to a fear that the ticks would survive the journey and spread. This gave west Kimberley cattlemen a monopoly on the beef trade and resulted in high prices.|$|E
25|$|Hemolytic anemia* {{is a type}} of {{regenerative}} anemia {{found in}} dogs characterized by destruction of the red blood cell. The most important type is immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, which can be a primary disease or secondary to cancer, infection, drugs, or vaccinations. Antibodies are present on the cell surface, leading to lysis and severe anemia. Other causes of hemolytic lesion include hypophosphatemia, exposure to toxins such as lead, infections such as ehrlichiosis or <b>babesiosis,</b> and rarely, neonatal isoerythrolysis. The behavioral condition pica, especially when involving the eating of concrete dust, tile grout, or sand, may be a sign of hemolytic anemia, indicating the need for a complete blood count to investigate a possible diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|Pound was {{commissioned}} by the Government in 1894 to investigate redwater cattle disease in the Gulf Country of Northern Australia. He reported parasites transmitted by ticks as the cause (see tick fever: <b>babesiosis,</b> anaplasmosis), which was subsequently confirmed by [...] A system of preventive inoculation was developed following Pound's experiments with blood from animals surviving tick fever, notably the Mundoolun experiments.|$|E

50|$|A {{reported}} {{increase in}} human <b>babesiosis</b> diagnoses in the 2000s {{is thought to}} be caused by more widespread testing and higher numbers of people with immunodeficiencies coming in contact with ticks, the disease vector. Little is known about the occurrence of Babesia species in malaria-endemic areas, where Babesia can easily be misdiagnosed as Plasmodium. Human patients with repeat <b>babesiosis</b> infection may exhibit premunity.|$|E
50|$|In animals, <b>babesiosis</b> is {{suspected}} by observation of clinical signs (hemoglobinuria and anemia) in animals in endemic areas. Diagnosis {{is confirmed by}} observation of merozoites on thin film blood smear examined at maximum magnification under oil using Romonovski stains (methylene blue and eosin). This is a routine part of the veterinary examination of dogs and ruminants in regions where <b>babesiosis</b> is endemic.|$|E

50|$|Cerebral <b>babesiosis</b> is {{suspected}} in vivo when neurological signs (often severe) {{are seen in}} cattle that are positive for B. bovis on blood smear, but this {{has yet to be}} proven scientifically. Outspoken red discoloration of the grey matter post mortem further strengthens suspicion of cerebral <b>babesiosis.</b> Diagnosis is confirmed post mortem by observation of Babesia-infected erythrocytes sludged in the cerebral cortical capillaries in a brain smear.|$|E
50|$|<b>Babesiosis</b> is a malaria-like {{parasitic}} disease caused by infection with Babesia, a genus of Apicomplexa. Human <b>babesiosis</b> is an uncommon but emerging {{disease in the}} Northeastern and Midwestern United States and parts of Europe, and sporadic {{throughout the rest of}} the world. It occurs in warm weather. Ticks transmit the human strain of <b>babesiosis,</b> so it often presents with other tick-borne illnesses such as Lyme disease. After trypanosomes, Babesia is thought to be the second-most common blood parasite of mammals, and they can have a major impact on health of domestic animals in areas without severe winters. In cattle, a major host, the disease is known as Texas cattle fever, redwater, or piroplasmosis.|$|E
