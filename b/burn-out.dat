25|$|Hence Halbertsma {{expected}} to be appointed professor of Dutch language and literature, and several times such an appointment seemed almost within his grasp, but each time it slipped away. His sharp pen probably {{played a role in}} this, but there were other reasons, too. In 1830, he lost out from the surplus of applicants washing over the Netherlands from the universities of Belgium, which at that time had just seceded from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and after 1840 a different type of scientist was called for, with a more specialised knowledge than Halbertsma commanded. That in 1837 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in literature by the University of Leiden, was scant consolation to him. In part because of these disappointments, Halbertsma balanced {{on the edge of a}} <b>burn-out</b> for a long time, and especially in 1839, when he was passed over yet again, he went through a deep crisis. It was only in the 1860s, when he was in his seventies, that he seems to have achieved a state of mental composure.|$|E

50|$|The Homeostat {{is one of}} {{the first}} devices capable of {{adapting}} itself to the environment; it exhibited behaviours such as habituation, reinforcement and learning through its ability to maintain homeostasis in a changing environment. It was built by William Ross Ashby in 1948 at Barnwood House Hospital. After a few technical hiccups with short-circuits causing <b>burn-outs,</b> the homeostat was finally completed on the 16th March, 1948. It was an adaptive ultrastable system, consisting of four interconnected Royal Air Force bomb control units with inputs, feedback, and magnetically driven, water-filled potentiometers. It illustrated his law of requisite variety — automatically adapting its configuration to stabilize the effects of any disturbances introduced into the system.|$|R
30|$|Another {{example is}} Anna, a 36 -year-old Dutch-Surinamese woman, who is {{currently}} employed, but has suffered through multiple depressions and two <b>burn-outs</b> in the past partly due to identity struggles. “I remember when I was 12 and visiting Suriname. There was {{a woman in the}} supermarket and she called me a bounty.

[…] And yeah, then all these depressions and <b>burn-outs</b> started […] I especially want to contribute to the multicultural society and help people with a bicultural background. Then I think yes, I can help achieve that by using my background and what I’ve been through. […] That is really important to me, that is really my goal […] My biggest problem turned out to be my biggest source of inspiration. Haha. Yes, the circle is complete now, huh?” Anna reconstructs her struggles and depressions as being suffered through for a purpose, thereby reconstructing her hardship as being meaningful. Her struggles with her identity inspired her major goal in life. It did not only inspire her and provide her with direction in life, Anna indicates that her background and her struggles formed a learning experience, thereby focusing on the ‘silver lining’ of the hardship she endured. Through the reconstruction from unordered chaos and suffering into a learning experience and a source of inspiration which guide her to a meaningful future, these events become less negative and enable her to escape from the vicious cycle of health problems and unemployment.|$|R

40|$|Study of {{contrast}} {{sensitivity of the}} human eye shows that our contrast discrimination sensitivity follows the weber law for suprathreshold levels. In this paper, we apply this fact effectively to design a contrast enhancement method for images that improves the local image contrast by controlling the local image gradient. Unlike previous methods, we achieve this without segmenting the image either in the spatial (multiscale) or frequency (multi-resolution) domain. We pose contrast enhancement as an optimization problem that maximizes the average local contrast of an image. The optimization formulation includes a perceptual constraint derived directly from human suprathreshold contrast sensitivity function. Then, we propose a greedy heuristic, controlled by a single parameter, to approximate this optimization problem. The results generated by our method is superior to existing techniques showing none of the common artifacts {{of contrast}} enhancements like halos, hue shift, and intensity <b>burn-outs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Exothermic {{packed bed}} {{catalytic}} reactors are usually characterised by a low diameter-aspect ratio to facilitate heat transfer. In operation, these reactors often exhibit localized regions with much higher temperatures {{referred to as}} hot spots. A new model based on a 2 -D network-of voids (NoV) has been devised to explore wall heat transfer behaviour for such low aspect ratio packed tubes. Random placement of (packing) particles is used to provide a simple NoV framework for implicitly creating the tortuous fluid flows amongst the resulting randomized inter-connecting voids. This is a computationally tractable strategy for exploring the haphazard appearance of individual tube pin-hole <b>burn-outs</b> amongst the typically thousands, or tens of thousands, of tubes within high temperature industrial multi-tubular configurations. Although presently limited to 2 -D, the model captures many natural features of the flow and heat transfer of randomly packed tubes, especially huge variations in wall and cross flows and consequently massive variations in local wall heat transfer coefficients {{along the length of}} individual tubes. The model is potentially superior to those based upon averaged properties, which do not properly distinguish the solid and fluid phases. The network-of-voids concept is readily extended to 3 -D, in order to achieve geometric congruence of the model and assemblies of individual particles...|$|R

40|$|Most {{models of}} {{production}} planning based on mathematical programming tend to assume constant technical coefficients. This assumption is realistic when the production {{is based on}} machines {{as it is the}} case in manufacturing. On the other hand, production planning in the service sector involves humans instead of machines. Consequently, the assumption that all technical coefficient of the mathematical program are constant cannot hold anymore. This is especially the case for productivity parameters related to human activity. It is well known for instance that in the service sector when administrative tasks are repetitive and boring, working overload has a direct impact on the employee productivity. We have adapted a manufacturing planning model producing industrial goods into a service production planning model. In this service model, employees with different job status (junior, senior and expert) are handling cases of specific difficulties (simple, standard, personal and special). Then, we have introduced a variable productivity formula into the mathematical program that takes into account “plateau” levels assuming diminishing productivities. To do so the mathematical program includes integer variables as well as non-linearity and thus becomes a NLMIP (Non Linear Mixed Integer Program). A fictitious case study is presented. The initial service production planning model with constant technical coefficient leads to solutions involving job specialization. On the other hand the model version with the variable productivity formula offers a better workload balance and more possibilities of job polyvalence reducing thus human risks such as <b>burn-outs...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} benefits of sustained community engagement {{in the political process}} are diverse: conflicts addressed and issues publicly debated in the short term, and social capital fostered and civic democracy strengthened for the future. One critical issue for sustainable community engagement is whether individuals who become engaged with an issue will maintain commitment over time. Turnover and attrition from community projects and groups reduces efficiency and prevents the development of social capital from long-term relationships. This paper reviews existing theories of sustained commitment from the social sciences and argues that the social psychology of group processes and identity can make a key contribution to the literature. Supporting evidence is drawn from two studies of passive and active war supporters and opponents conducted during and after the invasion of Iraq. High engagement with the political process among war opponents during the war steeply declined subsequently, providing a natural laboratory to test existing theories and models of sustainable community engagement. While political and sociological models of community participation received support in both studies, psychological identification with the process emerged as a key variable in each case. Moreover, a longitudinal study of activists showed, consistent with social psychological models, that engaging in collective action strengthened psychological identification over time, which reduced the rate of drop-outs. Normative conflicts emerged as key causes of <b>burn-outs</b> in the long term. The theoretical and social implications of the results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{ultraviolet}} (UV) window {{has been}} largely unexplored through balloons for astronomy. We discuss here {{the development of a}} compact near-UV spectrograph with fiber optics input for balloon ights. It is a modified Czerny-Turner system built using off-the-shelf components. The system is portable and scalable to different telescopes. The use of re ecting optics reduces the transmission loss in the UV. It employs an image-intensified CMOS sensor, operating in photon counting mode, as the detector of choice. A lightweight pointing system developed for stable pointing to observe astronomical sources is also discussed, together with the methods to improve its accuracy, e. g. using the in-house build star sensor and others. Our primary scientific objectives include the observation of bright Solar System objects such as visible to eye comets, Moon and planets. Studies of planets can give us valuable information about the planetary aurorae, helping to model and compare atmospheres of other planets and the Earth. The other major objective {{is to look at the}} diffuse UV atmospheric emission features (airglow lines), and at column densities of trace gases. This UV window includes several lines important to atmospheric chemistry, e. g. SO 2, O 3, HCHO, BrO. The spectrograph enables simultaneous measurement of various trace gases, as well as provides better accuracy at higher altitudes compared to electromechanical trace gas measurement sondes. These lines contaminate most astronomical observations but are poorly characterized.

As a whole, empirical research has proven that clergy stress and burnout are multiphasic because of the spiritual and secular demands and expectations from others. The primary purpose of this project is to enhance the present Board of Examiner 2 ̆ 7 s process in southwest Georgia to include a pastoral care and counseling component in its teaching and assessment process for new persons entering the A.
