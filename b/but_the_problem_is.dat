25|$|Air pollution, or {{suspended}} particulate matter locally generated from the increased number of automobiles in the area, from point sources such as factories, dust carried into the air by construction activity, and the contribution of similar pollutants from the Los Angeles area has regularly caused the Inland Empire to be at, or near, the bottom of many air quality ratings. In 2004, the EPA rated the San Bernardino-Riverside area as having the worst particulate air pollution in the United States, (although the San Joaquin Valley in central California had the worst overall air pollution). Air pollution in the Los Angeles region is still an issue, although improvements have been made over the years. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> exacerbated in the Inland Empire, which is surrounded by mountains on {{the north and the}} east.

25|$|Ozone gas attacks any polymer {{possessing}} olefinic or double bonds {{within its}} chain structure, such as natural rubber, nitrile rubber, and styrene-butadiene rubber. Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, {{the rate of}} crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding antiozonants, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. Ozone cracking {{used to be a}} serious problem in car tires for example, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> now seen only in very old tires. On the other hand, many critical products, like gaskets and O-rings, may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. Fuel lines made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a DC electric motor can accelerate ozone cracking. The commutator of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.|$|E
25|$|Charlie's {{research}} often {{interferes with}} his relationships: as with Amita {{on their first}} date, for all they could talk about is mathematics; Fleinhardt {{says that it is}} a common interest and they should not struggle to avoid the subject. Charlie and Amita had several false starts. Charlie has also spent some time with his ex-girlfriend, Susan Berry (Sonya Walger), an attractive neuroscientist from London. He had lived with Susan for two years, and Larry described this as his very own Berry's phase. However, she later reveals that she is currently involved with someone else and has to return to England. Charlie attempts to start a relationship with Amita once more, though her job offer at Harvard University strains this possibility and makes him distraught for some time. Eventually, she decides to take the alternative offer at CalSci with the hope to begin a romantic relationship with him, though his fear of possible failure causes him to question whether he wants this second chance; Don cautions him about such an attitude. Amita notices his ambivalence and isn't certain if she wants to back out of the relationship, but he then pushes it forward. Pressures from their colleagues over the inappropriateness of the relationship nearly cost them, but {{by the middle of the}} third season their romantic involvement stabilizes and they have grown considerably closer. He feels rejected when Amita does not want him to meet her father, due to his expectations about the men she dates. Initially, he wonders if it is based on him being Jewish, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that he is not Indian-born. Alan explains that Mr. Ramanujan would like him after meeting him. Charlie and Amita state that they love each other, and have even decided to move in together, though, the actual living arrangement has not been determined. When Amita's parents finally meet him, they are rude, but warm to him later. Alan says that Charlie will have to marry her.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers behind Twilight {{worked to}} create a film that was as {{faithful}} to the novel as they thought possible when converting the story to another medium, with producer Greg Mooradian saying, [...] "It's very important to distinguish that we're making a separate piece of art that obviously is going to remain very, very faithful to the book.... But at the same time, we have a separate responsibility {{to make the best}} movie you can make." [...] To ensure a faithful adaptation, Meyer was kept very involved in the production process, having been invited to visit the set during filming and even asked to give notes on the script and on a rough cut of the film. Of this process, she said, [...] "It was a really pleasant exchange [...] from the beginning, which I think is not very typical. They were really interested in my ideas", and, [...] "...they kept me in the loop and with the script, they let me see it and said, 'What are your thoughts?'... They let me have input on it and I think they took 90 percent of what I said and just incorporated it right in to the script." [...] Meyer fought for one line in particular, one of the most well-known from the book about [...] "the lion and the lamb", to be kept verbatim in the film: [...] "I actually think the way Melissa [...] wrote it sounded better for the movie [...] <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that line is actually tattooed on peoples' bodies [...] But I said, 'You know, if you take that one and change it, that's a potential backlash situation. Meyer was even invited {{to create a}} written list of things that could not be changed for the film, such as giving the vampires fangs or killing characters who do not die in the book, that the studio agreed to follow. The consensus among critics is that the filmmakers succeeded in making a film that is very faithful to its source material, with one reviewer stating that, with a few exceptions, [...] "Twilight the movie is unerringly faithful to the source without being hamstrung by it." ...|$|E

[...] While {{she was in the}} potato form, the designers noticed a [...] "very stark difference between this imperious, all-powerful GLaDOS talking to you, and this powerless GLaDOS talking to you on your gun".

[...] Tammy LaGorce from Amazon.com judged that the album [...] "boasts Super Glue-strength harmonies and an overall tightness of sound" [...] and that [...] "the music is more thoughtful and mature than ever." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly judged that [...] "They come close to recreating the sheer euphoria of their biggest pre-2YK smashes {{on many of the}} up-tempo dance-pop numbers that follow." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, writing that [...] "the basic sound of the album is good, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that few of the songs stick. Here, the Backstreet Boys don't have any songs that will lift them out of the adult contemporary world -- but the audience who has turned from teens to adults with them will likely enjoy its easy sound, as there is nothing bad here. There's just nothing great, either." [...] Gemma Padley of BBC Music felt that the album [...] "is a valiant effort at reinvention and an at times gutsier record."

2500|$|The game's story {{picks up}} {{shortly after the}} end of Serious Sam: The Second Encounter, with the hero of the series, Sam [...] "Serious" [...] Stone, {{continuing}} his goal to defeat his nemesis, Mental. The game begins with Serious Sam being summoned before the Sirian Great Council, where the Council provides him with guidance on how to accomplish his goal to defeat Mental. The Council reveals to Sam that he must collect all five pieces of an ancient Sirian medallion, each held by various groups on five different planets, and states that once Sam has the entire medallion, Mental will be vulnerable. All the planets (except Kleer) are populated by friendly, bobble-headed humanoids, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that all the planets are under Mental's control. The Council then instructs Sam to visit all five planets in order to recreate the medallion, only then will Sam become [...] "The One". Confused at the moment and with nothing better to do, Sam accepts the mission. With the medallion finally complete, Sam is now ready to begin the final assault against the greatest enemy of humanity...Mental, who is located on Sirius, once the planet of the great Sirians that visited Earth many times, now the domain of Mental himself. But in order to gain access to Sirius, Sam is asked to storm Kronor, a moon orbiting Sirius that has a massive cannon which could be used to remove Sirius' protection shield, which was a last line of defense for the Sirians against Mental. And so, Sam's mission continues. In the endgame, Sam enters Mental Institution after disabling it and into Mental's throne room. Sam finally encounters Mental in person while the lights are off. Mental tries to reveal to Sam that he is his father, but Sam interrupts by shooting him, thus silencing Mental forever. After that, the Sirian Great Council, even the inhabitants from the planets, celebrate their long-awaited victory against Mental. When the lights come back on however, it is revealed that Mental wasn't there at all and it was instead just a speaker attached to Mental's throne, implying that he actually tricked Sam in order to escape in his starship into deep space (in the Xbox version, the game doesn't show this scene). The credits roll after that, where a dialog of three unknown people is played discussing how this ending might just be another one of Croteam's bad jokes and how big Mental's boss fight could be.|$|E

60|$|But the {{researches}} of Mr. Darwin totally {{changed our}} point of view in this matter. He showed, clearly, that some of the colours of animals are useful, some hurtful to them; and he believed that many of the most brilliant colours were developed by sexual choice; while his great general principle, that all the fixed characters of organic beings have been developed under the action of the law of utility, led to the inevitable conclusion that so remarkable and conspicuous a character as colour, which so often constitutes the most obvious distinction of species from species, or group from group, must also have arisen from survival of the fittest, and must, therefore, in most cases have some relation to the wellbeing of its possessors. Continuous observation and research, carried on by multitudes of observers during the last thirty years, have shown this to be the case; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> found to be far more complex than was at first supposed. The modes in which colour is of use to different classes of organisms is very varied, and have probably not yet been all discovered; while the infinite variety and marvellous beauty of some of its developments are such as to render it hopeless to arrive at a complete and satisfactory explanation of every individual case. So much, however, has been achieved, so many curious facts have been explained, and so much light has been thrown on some of the most obscure phenomena of nature, that the subject deserves a prominent place in any account of the Darwinian theory.|$|E
