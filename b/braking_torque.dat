25|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} Duntov created for Sting Ray was essentially a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The transverse spring was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier, with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper control arms. The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old solid axle, the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in unsprung weight, which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard anti-roll bar. Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new hydraulic steering damper (essentially a shock absorber), which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced lock-to-lock turns from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|E

Figure 10 shows that the <b>brake</b> <b>torque,</b> {{in the case of}} a constant compression ratio, changes between 281 and 252 N.m passing through a maximum of 295 N.m at about 1, 900 rpm. For the variable compression ratio, the <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> is kept constant at its maximum value of 295 N.m over a speed ranging from 1, 500 to 2, 460 rpm by varying the compression ratio between 16.4 and 19.3. This means that the <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> increases by 5.4 % at 1, 500 rpm and 4.6 % at 2, 460 rpm.

40|$|The <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> of a direct-{{injection}} {{diesel engine}} {{is known to}} plateau over a range of injection timings. Injection timing affects the engine?s ignition delay and the fractions of fuel which burn in premixed and diffusion modes. Therefore, the characteristics of combustion for swept injection timings along the maximum <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> plateau are determined. The research is conducted by varying injection timing at constant engine speed and load while measuring engine emissions and in-cylinder pressure, revealing the premixed and diffusion burn fractions as well as important engine and exhaust design criteria such as maximum in-cylinder pressure and exhaust composition. These results are significant in diesel engine design because cheaper, lighter engines may be built if desired maximum <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> may be produced with lower peak in-cylinder pressures. More critically, different emissions composition profiles exist for the desired maximum <b>brake</b> <b>torque,</b> which will allow designers to choose injection calibrations which favor some emissions over others. In fact, both favorable emissions and in-cylinder pressure criteria {{can be achieved by}} implementing more retarded timings along the <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> plateau without losses in efficiency or power output...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Electroslag Remelting (ESR) {{technology}} is a main method of special metallurgy; and split pillar {{is one of the}} most important mechanical units of ESR. The split pillar works not only as the mother body of ESR cross arm, but also as the rotation driving device of the cross arm. Since the tremendous mass of the cross arm and electrodes, serious inertia torque generates when the split pillar rotates, which leads to motion instability and problems of angle location and even safety threatens. In this paper, based on virtual machine technology, dynamic research of the rotation process of the electroslag-remelting-furnace split pillar was proceeded; influences of driving torque applied on the split pillar was researched, as the driving torque being constant, anti-step and with <b>brake</b> <b>torque.</b> 3 D solid model of the split pillar and clamping device were established; main technical parameters were accomplished; and simulation research of the dynamic process was proceeded.

5000|$|The split pivot {{design is}} a special case of linkage-driven single pivot in {{which one of the}} four-bar's pivot points coincides with the rear axle. This allows for the disc brake caliper to be mounted on the {{floating}} linkage (also called coupler) instead of on the swingarm. As a result of this the <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> now interacts with the suspension via the floating linkage. The linkages can be designed such that this has a positive effect on suspension performance under braking, typically reducing brake jack. Furthermore, the relative rotation between brake disc and brake caliper as the suspension goes through its travel is different from that in single pivot designs. The four linkages in a split pivot design influence how <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> is transmitted, how the brake caliper moves in relation to the disc and influence the leverage ratio between wheel travel and shock travel. Since these influences may have a different optimum linkage design, the bike's design has to strike a balance. Dave Weagle designed a split pivot which he named [...] "Split Pivot". Trek Bicycle Corporation also released a version of the split pivot design called [...] "Active Braking Pivot" [...] (ABP) in early 2007. Cycles Devinci has released a licensed implementation of the [...] "Split Pivot" [...] design which Dave Weagle managed to patent.|$|E
50|$|The {{benefit of}} such a system is {{primarily}} the reduction of unsprung weight which improves handling and ride. The suspension {{does not have to}} resist twisting when the brakes are applied. The wheels don't enclose the brake mechanism allowing greater flexibility in wheel offset, and placement of suspension members. It is also much easier to protect the brake mechanism from the outside environment, and protect it from water, dust, and oil. Of secondary importance is flexible brake pipes are avoided; rigid pipes allow increases in brake fluid pressure, allowing for a smaller disc to manage a given <b>braking</b> <b>torque.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} {{thesis is}} a part of a funded project between Saab automotive and Chalmers University of Technology. Within the organization the project is known as ‘EVBB project’ which stands for; ‘Electric Vehicle Blended Braking’. A blended brake control merges a regenerative brake system with a friction brake system. The aim is to get a better understanding regarding to what extent a regenerative brake system is capable of recovering energy and how it will affect vehicle stability and maneuverability. The variable torque and power limitations of the electric motor require a brake-by-wire system that can apply the remaining <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> to fulfill the total <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> demanded by the driver. Proper <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> proportioning and the working area of the electric motor are visualized by means of brake force distribution plots. Simulations are performed for a mild parallel hybrid electric vehicle with a separate axle drive train. The drive train has a 30 [kW] electric motor mounted on the rear axle. A two track model with electric power train has been developed. The simulation results are based on this 7 DOF planar vehicle model, meaning that any pitch and roll motion of the vehicle body is excluded. The vehicle model has a closed-loop torque control, enabling velocity tracking of driving cycles. The control of lateral dynamics by means of the steering input is open-loop. A method of ‘non-linear tyre force estimation’ by means of look-up tables, based upon Pacejka’s Magic Formulas, has been used. Simulation results of two proposed control strategies show that rear wheel regenerative braking is effective. A control that initially biases the <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> to the rear axle is able to recuperate 90 % of the brake energy on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Controlling the 30 [kW] regenerative brake system conforming to the ideal brake force distribution diminishes the power limitations of the electric motor. The strategy reduces the portion of regenerative <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> but might recuperate more energy during extra urban use...|$|R
5000|$|... "Applied torque" [...] {{may either}} be driving torque applied by a motor (often through a transmission) or a <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> applied by brakes(including {{regenerative}} braking). Such torques results in energy dissipation (above {{that due to}} the basic rolling resistance of a freely rolling, non-driven, non-braked wheel). This additional loss is {{in part due to}} the fact that there is some slipping of the wheel, and for pneumatic tires, there is more flexing of the sidewalls due to the torque. Slip is defined such that a 2% slip means that the circumferential speed of the driving wheel exceeds the speed of the vehicle by 2%.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} {{differences}} from these precursors to the Chapman strut. As the Lotus Twelve had inboard disk brakes, {{there was no}} need to pass the <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> through the radius rods. Chapman also avoided the swing axle and its camber changes with suspension travel, in favour of a drive shaft with two universal joints. The connection between the hub carrier and the shock absorber base was made rigid, making the spring unit into a strut and also controlling the camber angle. Using the drive shaft itself to control the rear track meant that the shaft could be of fixed length, avoiding the need for a sliding spline joint and its stiction problems.|$|E
50|$|Rotary LFF {{consists}} of a freely rotating permanent magnet (or an array of magnets mounted on a flywheel {{as shown in figure}} 4), which is magnetized perpendicularly to the axle it is mounted on.

The equilibrium rotation rate varies directly with the flow velocity and inversely with the distance between the magnet and the duct. In this case it is possible to measure either the torque on the magnet system or the angular velocity at which the wheel spins.|$|E
