50|$|At {{its height}} in the 1920s, Sunbeam Motor Car Company’s Moorfield works {{employed}} 3,500 staff on their 50-acre site. The buildings covered a full 15 acres. Sunbeam made a 3-axle bus chassis in December 1928 {{in an attempt}} to diversify.

A smaller 2-axle model Pathan appeared in August 1929 fitted with a 6.6-litre engine developing 110 bhp capable of carrying a 26-seater single deck or luxury coach body. Sales were disappointing despite Sunbeam's good build quality. Sydney S Guy had been Sunbeam Works Manager until May 1914 when he left to start his own business. His Guy Motors had produced the world's first 3-axle trolleybuses in 1926, and Wolverhampton Corporation had bought a number of them. In 1931 Sunbeam decided to follow suit and split off a commercial vehicles division. They took their 3-axle motor bus chassis and modified it to carry the electric motors and control gear of a trolleybus. The design was a success, and large numbers were sold. By the summer of 1933 Sunbeam trolleybuses were running on the Wolverhampton, Walsall and other British networks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this {{investigating}} study {{diesel fuel}} {{was used as}} a reference fuel for 2 -Ethoxy Ethyl Acetate –diesel blends. The blends containing 5, 10 and 15 % of 2 -Ethoxy Ethyl Acetate fuel by volume are tested on test rig developed for the experimentation. All the tests were conducted in steady state and were set at constant engine speed 1500 RPM. With the addition of oxygen in the fuel, it has been observed that the emission contents reduce remarkably. Moreover there is an increase in the <b>Brake</b> <b>Horse</b> <b>Power</b> and Brake Thermal Efficiency of the engine. So it can be concluded that the addition of 2 -Ethoxy Ethyl Acetate by 10 % in diesel not only helps to reduce the exhaust emission but also increases the performance of the diesel engine. 10 % blend increases the BHP by 7. 6 % and BTE increases by 7. 2 % at full load conditions. Also this blend ration decreases the CO % by 16 %, HC by 11. 9 % and Smoke Opacity reduces by 19. 11 %.

In this present work, experimentation was carried out to study the performance and emission characteristics of mahua oil and ethanol blends. For this experiment a single cylinder, four stroke, air cooled diesel engine was used. Initially the engine was run on diesel fuel and the readings were recorded. Then the engine was run on mahua oil and its different blends with ethanol. The blends containing 5, 10 and 15 percent ethanol fuel by volume were denoted as M 5, M 10 and M 15 respectively. The tests were carried out over entire range of engine operation at varying conditions of load. The engine performance parameters studied were <b>brake</b> <b>horse</b> <b>power,</b> brake specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency. The emission characteristics studied are CO, HC, CO 2 and smoke opacity. Brake thermal efficiency is high at low and medium loads. For M 5 there is 5. 1 % increase in brake thermal efficiency compared to diesel at low loads. From emission of blends, it is found that HC reduces 11 %, CO and smoke decreases by 19 % and 33. 7 % when compared to those of diesel.

Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1907. Introduction: The object {{of this series}} of tests was {{to determine}} the relative value of gasoline, denatured alcohol, and kerosene as fuel for an internal combustion engine designed and built for the use of gasoline. The fuels were tested under practically the same conditions, the only changes made in the engine were such that were necessary for obtaining the greatest <b>brake</b> <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> possible. The first or trial tests were made with a strap brake but it was soon found that this was not suitable for engines or motors above five horse power. We also found that oil was the best for cooling a brake of this type. After proving that the strap brake was insufficient, a wooden Prony brake was constructed and used throughout the remaining tests. With this brake a constant supply of water proved better for cooling, but there was a small amount of chattering which could not be avoided on account of the engine being of the four cycle type. The engine used was a ten horse power Witte Gasoline using the "hammer break" type of igniter. The fuel tank was placed on the wall above the engine so the supply did not depend on the pump. This tank was fitted with a gage glass so the amount of fuel at the start could be marked {{and at the end of}} the test, the overflow was put back and the tank filled to the point marked at the start. The amount required to fill the tank to the starting point, after putting back the overflow, was what the engine had used during the test. The cooling water for the cylinder [...] ...|$|E
