5000|$|Maudslay {{invented the}} first <b>bench</b> <b>micrometer</b> capable of {{measuring}} to one ten-thousandth {{of an inch}} (0.0001 in ≈ 3 µm). He called it the [...] "Lord Chancellor", as {{it was used to}} settle any questions regarding accuracy of workmanship.|$|E
5000|$|Henry Maudslay built a <b>bench</b> <b>micrometer</b> in {{the early}} 19th century that was [...] nicknamed [...] "the Lord Chancellor" [...] among his staff {{because it was the}} final judge on {{measurement}} accuracy and precision in the firm's work. In 1844 details of Whitworth's workshop micrometer were published. This was described as having a strong frame of cast iron, the opposite ends of which were two highly finished steel cylinders, which traversed longitudinally by action of screws. The ends of the cylinders where they met was of hemispherical shape. One screw was fitted with a wheel graduated to measure to the ten thousandth of an inch. His object was to furnish ordinary mechanics with an instrument which, while it afforded very accurate indications, was yet not very liable to be deranged by the rough handling of the workshop.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bench</b> <b>micrometers</b> of the [...] "super-mic" [...] class entirely obviate this interuser {{variation}} {{by having}} the user dial the handwheel until a needle reads zero on a gauge, producing the same pressure on every reading.|$|R
50|$|Pratt & Whitney Measurement Systems is an American {{manufacturer}} of precision length measuring metrology instruments.  Main product lines include universal comparators, <b>bench</b> <b>micrometers,</b> and inspection gaging systems.  These instruments primarily use laser interferometers, encoders and LVDT's and are primarily used in quality departments, calibration laboratories, and in manufacturing environments.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bench</b> <b>micrometers</b> are {{tools for}} {{inspection}} use whose {{accuracy and precision}} are around half a micrometre (20 millionths of an inch, [...] "a fifth of a tenth" [...] in machinist jargon) and whose repeatability is around a quarter micrometre ("a tenth of a tenth"). An example is the Pratt & Whitney Supermicrometer brand.|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} laser induced {{fluorescence}} calibration for engine and simulating rigs was studied using both a static calibration rig and a dynamic method involving a modified piston-ring specimen. The technique {{used to measure}} oil film thickness was laser induced fluorescence through optical fibres. Previous experimental {{studies have been conducted}} in test rigs and engines to obtain in-situ results showing the uncertainties lying within every applied method. In this study a comparison of two proposed methods is performed – <b>bench</b> calibration (<b>micrometer</b> based) and dynamic for a single piston-ring test rig application. Engine in-situ calibration was not an option so that uncertainties that follow the direct measurements in the piston cylinder engine assembly and the difficulty in determining the exact properties of the lubricant at the ring-pack, which simultaneously affect fluorescence (e. g. local temperature at point of measurement, lubricant degradation) could be avoided. A temperature parametric study of the dynamic calibration coefficient is also presented and a comparison between results from capacitance transducer minimum oil film thickness measurements and the LIF measurements. The discussion that follows the results, tries to enlighten the reasons behind inconsistencies found between the proposed methods...|$|R
