5|$|The spongy {{bones of}} the woodpecker's skull and the {{flexibility}} of its beak, both of which provide protection for the brain when drumming, have provided inspiration to engineers; a <b>black</b> <b>box</b> needs to survive intact when a plane falls from the sky, and modelling the <b>black</b> <b>box</b> with regard to a woodpecker's anatomy has increased the resistance of this device to damage sixty-fold. The design of protective helmets is another field being influenced by the study of woodpeckers.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} quantum theory allows for transformations of <b>black</b> <b>boxes</b> that cannot be {{realized}} by inserting the input <b>black</b> <b>boxes</b> within a circuit in a predefined causal order. The simplest {{example of such}} a transformation is the classical switch of <b>black</b> <b>boxes,</b> where two input <b>black</b> <b>boxes</b> are arranged in two different orders conditionally on the value of a classical bit. The quantum version of this transformation - the quantum switch - produces an output circuit where the order of the connections is controlled by a quantum bit, which becomes entangled with the circuit structure. Simulating these transformations in a circuit with fixed causal structure requires either postselection or an extra query to the input <b>black</b> <b>boxes.</b> © 2013 American Physical Society.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} checking whether an incomplete design (i. e. a design containing so-called <b>Black</b> <b>Boxes)</b> can still be extended to a complete design satisfying a given property or whether the property is satisfied for all possible extensions. In this paper we extend a method based {{on a series of}} approximate, yet sound algorithms to prove or disprove CTL properties for incomplete designs [1]. Each algorithm in the previous approach was able to model the effect of the unknown information at the outputs of the <b>Black</b> <b>Boxes</b> at a different level of accuracy (leading to different requirements for computational resources). In this paper we present a novel approach which is able to use different methods for modeling unknowns at the outputs of different <b>Black</b> <b>Boxes</b> within a single model checking run. This permits us to handle less relevant <b>Black</b> <b>Boxes</b> (in terms of the CTL formula) with larger approximation and thus faster, whereas we do not lose important information when the possible effect of more relevant <b>Black</b> <b>Boxes</b> is modeled by more exact methods. Finally we give a series of experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness and feasibility of the new method. ...|$|R

5|$|Network {{synthesis}} filters. The mathematical {{bases of}} network synthesis were {{laid in the}} 1930s and 1940s. After the end of World War II network synthesis became the primary tool of filter design. Network synthesis put filter design on a firm mathematical foundation, freeing it from the mathematically sloppy techniques of image design and severing the connection with physical lines. The essence of network synthesis is that it produces a design that will (at least if implemented with ideal components) accurately reproduce the response originally specified in <b>black</b> <b>box</b> terms.|$|E

Vox Musica, which traces its roots back to 1968, is a community choir based at the University of Lethbridge and has been performing since 1984. Theatrical productions are presented by the University of Lethbridge's theatre department and the New West Theatre, which produces seven shows annually. New West Theatre performs at the Genevieve E.

5|$|During {{the first}} season, Nikita gains some allies {{to aid in}} her fight against Division, {{including}} Owen Elliot (Devon Sawa), a guardian to one of Division's several black boxes; hard drives contain files of Division's missions, until Percy tried to have him killed, CIA analyst Ryan Fletcher (Noah Bean) who was investigating black operations invisible to the United States government, and eventually her trainer Michael, after he learns Percy {{was responsible for the}} deaths of his wife and daughter. The two would be in a relationship for the rest of the series' run. By the first-season finale, Alex learns that Nikita killed her father and leaves her to become a free agent for Amanda (Melinda Clarke), Division's psychologist who overthrew Percy to lead Division with the help of Oversight, a group of American politicians who ensure that Division's existence remains secret from the public (Alex would later return to fight alongside with Nikita again midway through season two). Michael is discovered to be working with Nikita and the two end up on the run together with a <b>black</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
5|$|On Jan. 11, 2016, the Klein ISD Board of Trustees {{approved}} the Design Development for Intermediate School #10.

Per the current instructional program for intermediate schools, the campus includes a <b>Black</b> <b>Box</b> theater classroom that is being designed to combine as a stage, collaboration areas within the communities for project-based learning and small group instruction, and Makerspace in the library or learning commons.

5|$|A non-pegylated {{liposomal}} doxorubicin, called Myocet, {{is approved}} in Europe and Canada {{for treatment of}} metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide, but has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA <b>black</b> <b>box</b> warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.|$|E
