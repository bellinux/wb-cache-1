40|$|ABSTRACT:n the {{province}} of Ontario, The Retail <b>Business</b> <b>Holidays</b> Act regulates retail business services m holidays. The Act defines Sunday as a "holiday " and so Sunday is treated the same way as,he other public holidays. The Act has raised much controversy {{over the past few}} years as the 1 mbiguity over the wording of the Act and the problems with enforcement, has left room for ~etailers to do as they please regarding Sunday opening. In tum many different retailers, religious organizations and labour groups have voiced varying concerns to the provincial;overnment of Ontario. This research paper investigated the consumer attitudes towards Sunday shopping in Hamilton, Ontario. The main objective was to determine through the method of::ross tabulation whether attitudes differed based on household income, sex, presence/absence Df children in the family, age, employment status, religion and marital status. The second focus was to determine whether consumsers favoured a particular type of shopping on Sunday. Finally, to view the opinion of the consumers on who should legislate and the form the legislation should take. Data was obtained thru a survey questionnaire distributed at Jackson Square and Centre Mall in Hamilton. The major finding of this thesis was that Hamilton consumers have varying attitudes towards Sunday shopping. ii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS My sincerest appreciation goes to Dr. Steven Reader, for his guidance, constructiv...|$|E
