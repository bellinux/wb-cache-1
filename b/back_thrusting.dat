40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2007 Fractures form in {{foreland}} basin rocks {{during their}} progressive incorporation into fold-and-thrust deformation and subsequent uplift. This study investigates {{the relationship between}} fracture distribution {{and the evolution of}} the fold-and-thrust belt. This study identifies four fracture sets in pre-orogenic carbonates of the Brooks Range northward into foreland basin. Fracture distribution, structural style, and apatite fission-track (AFT) data define four structural domains. Domain I consists of strongly deformed Mississippian through Triassic rocks. Fracture sets 1, 2 and 4 are present in domain I, reflecting Valanginian through early Tertiary deformation. Domains II-IV consist of clastic basin deposits hosting fracture sets 2 - 4. Domains II and IV share fracture set distributions (sets 3 and 4), AFT cooling ages (70 - 60 Ma) and deformational style of open ~symmetric detachment folds. Domain III includes fracture sets 2 - 4, AFT cooling ages of ~ 100 Ma, reflecting thermal immaturity and south-vergent structures consistent with <b>back</b> <b>thrusting.</b> Restoration of early Tertiary deformation is constrained by surface, seismic and thermal data. Reconstruction shows the importance of <b>back</b> <b>thrusting</b> within domain III during the early Tertiary, the northern extent of the orogenic wedge, and the relationship between fold-and-thrust deformation and the relative timing and distribution of fracture sets in the Brooks Range foothills...|$|E

Subsidence processes (up to ~ 20 mm/yr) were investigated comparing geological, hydrogeological, and land use information with interferometric results. We suppose a correlation between subsidence and thickness of the Plio-Quaternary succession suggesting an active role of the isostatic compensation. Furthermore, the active <b>back</b> <b>thrusting</b> in the Corigliano Gulf could trigger a flexural subsidence mechanism even if fault activity and earthquakes do not seem {{play a role in}} the present subsidence. In this context, the compaction of Holocene deposits contributes to ground deformation. Despite the rapid urbanization of the area in the last 50 years, we do not consider the intensive groundwater pumping and related water table drop as the main triggering cause of subsidence phenomena, in disagreement with some previous publications. Our interpretation for the deformation fields related to natural and anthropogenic factors would be a comprehensive and exhaustive justification to the complexity of subsidence processes in the Sibari Plain...|$|E

40|$|The Palaeozoic sediments {{present in}} the Oslo area reflect the outward growth of the Caledonian Orogen, making it a {{classical}} area {{for the study of}} frontal thrust systems. Bruton et al. (2010) proposed a revised structural model for the tectonic development of this basin, but detailed structural field data to support the model is still lacking. Analogue mechanical laboratory models were performed to better understand the structural inhomogeneities affiliated with the proposed structural model. The present study covers two profiles; an 8 km N-S profile along the eastern shore of Tyrifjorden just south of Sundvollen and a 1. 5 km profile along the western shore of Tyrifjorden just south of the first profile. The section along the shore south of Sundvollen shows open folding on the scale of hundred of meters and severe strain localized in the Utstranda pop-up generating an anticlinorium. Deformation in this section is strongly affected by <b>back</b> <b>thrusting,</b> which is localized below the mechanically strong Ringerike sandstone. Similar strain localization and strain transfer are observed in the analogue models. The analogue models and field observations agree in terms of variation in deformation styles and presence of high and low strain regimes.

40|$|We model {{evolution}} of a continent-continent collision and draw some parallels with the tectonic {{evolution of}} the Himalaya. We use a large-scale visco-plasto-elastic thermomechanical model that has a free upper surface, accounts for erosion and deposition and allows for all modes of lithospheric deformation. For quartz/olivine rheology and 60 mm/yr convergence rate, the continental subduction is stable, and the model predicts three distinct phases. During the phase 1 (120 km or 6 % of shortening), deformation is characterized by <b>back</b> <b>thrusting</b> around the suture zone. Some amount of delaminated lower crust accumulates at depth. During phase 2 (120 km– 420 km or 6 %– 22 % of shortening), this crustal root is exhumed (medium- to high-grade rocks) along a newly formed major thrust fault. This stage bears similarities with the period of coeval activity of the Main Central thrust and of the South Tibetan Detachment between 20 – 16 Myr ago. During phase 3 (> 420 km or 22 % of shortening), the crust is scraped off from the mantle lithosphere and is incorporated into large crustal wedge. Deformation is localized around frontal thrust faults. This kinematics should produce only low- to medium-grade exhumation. This stage might {{be compared with the}} tectonics that has prevailed in the Himalaya over the last 15 Myr allowing for the formation of the Lesser Himalaya. The experiment is conducted at constant convergence rate, which implies increasing compressive force. Considering that this force is constant in nature, this result may be equivalent to a slowing down of the convergence rate as was observed during the India-Asia collision...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSandbox experiments, using a {{two-dimensional}} and a three-dimensional approach, {{are used to}} study the deformation of margins in response to seamount subduction. Successive mechanisms of deformation are activated during the subduction of conical seamounts. First, reactivation of the frontal thrusts and compaction of the accretionary wedge is observed. Then, <b>back</b> <b>thrusting</b> and, conjugate strike-slip faulting develops above the leading slope of the subducted seamount. The basal d 6 collement is deflected upward {{in the wake of}} the subducting high, and a large shadow zone develops behind the seamount trailing slope. Consequently, frontal accretion is inhibited and part of the frontal margin is dragged into the subduction zone. When the main d 6 collement returns to its basal level {{in the wake of the}} seamount, the margin records a rapid subsidence and a new accretionary wedge develops, closing the margin reentrant. The sediments underthrusted in the wake of the seamount into the shadow zone, are underplated beneath the rear part of the accretionary wedge. Substantial shortening and thickening of the deformable seaward termination of the upper plate basement, associated with basal erosion is observed. Seamount subduction induces significant material transfer within the accretionary wedge, favors large tectonic erosion of the frontal margin and thickening of the rear part of the margin. The subduction and underplating of relatively undeformed, water-ladden sediments, associated with fluid expulsion along the fractures affecting the margin could modify the fluid pressure along the basal ddcollement. Consequently, significant variations of the effective basal friction and local mechanical coupling between the two plates could be expected around the subducting seamount...|$|E

40|$|International audienceGeochronologic Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 data of fabric-forming {{metamorphic}} minerals, {{in conjunction}} with structural and metamorphic studies, are being increasingly used to constrain the deformation and tectonometamorphic evolution of polyphase low-grade orogens. Careful data interpretation is needed to extract meaningful age constraints from neo- and recrystallized minerals affected by isotopic disturbances. In the southern Quebec Appalachians, the Sutton Mountains anticlinoriurn exposes the metamorphic core of the early Paleozoic continental margin of Laurentia. Orogenesis {{in this part of}} the Appalachians was the result of tectonic events that have been classically attributed to the combined effects of the Middle to Late Ordovician Taconian and the Middle Devonian Acadian orogenies; however, evidence of separate and distinct Silurian-Early Devonian tectonism has also been recently documented. Laser step-heating Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 data on single-grains of muscovite from polydeformed greenschist facies samples of the Sutton Mountains anticlinorium indicate that these tectonometamorphic events are heterogeneously preserved as a prograde Taconian event at ca. 45 Ma and an Acadian overprint at ca. 390 Ma. The integration of Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 age spectra analyses with structural relationships provides precise age constraints on the duration, propagation, and evolution of Silurian-Early Devonian hinterland directed deformation as it migrated across the anticlinorium, including <b>back</b> <b>thrusting</b> from ca. 433 Ma to ca. 420 Ma and extensional faulting from ca. 417 Ma to ca. 405 Ma. Along the Laurentian margin of the northern Appalachians, such Silurian-Early Devonian tectonism is currently attributed either to the collapse of the Taconian orogen triggered by the delamination of the subducted slab or to the outboard accretion of peri-Gondwanan terranes during the Satinic orogeny...|$|E
40|$|Between {{the cities}} of Domodossola and Locarno, the complex ``Centovalli Line'' tectonic zone of the Central Alps {{outlines}} deformation phases {{over a long period}} of time (probably starting similar to 30 Ma ago) and under variable P-T conditions. The last deformation phases developed gouge-bearing faults with a general E-W trend that crosscuts the roots of the Alpine Canavese zone and the Finero ultramafic body. Kinematic indicators show that the general motion was mainly dextral associated with <b>back</b> <b>thrusting</b> towards the S. The < 2 mu m clay fractions of fault gouges from Centovalli Line consist mainly of illite, smectite and chlorite with varied illite-smectite, chlorite-smectite and chlorite-serpentine mixed-layers. Constrained with the illite crystallinity index, the thermal conditions induced by the tectonic activity show a gradual trend from anchizonal to diagenetic conditions. The < 2 and < 0. 2 mu M clay fractions, and hydrothermal K-feldspar separates all provide K-Ar ages between 14. 2 +/- 2. 9 Ma and roughly 0 Ma, with major episodes at about 12, 8, 6 and close to 0 Ma These ages set the recurrent tectonic activity and the associated fluid circulations between Upper Miocene and Recent. On the basis of the K-Ar ages and with a thermal gradient of 25 - 30 degrees C/km, the studied fault zones were located at a depth of 4 - 7 km. If they were active until now as observed in field, the exhumation was approximately 2. 5 - 3. 0 km for the last 12 Ma with a mean velocity of 0. 4 mm/y. Comparison with available models on the recent Alpine evolution shows that the tectonic activity in the area relates to a continuum of the back-thrusting movements of the Canavese Line, and/or to several late-extensional phases of the Rhone-Simplon line. The Centovalli-Val Vigezzo zone therefore represents a major tectonic zone of the Central-Western Alps resulting from different interacting tectonic events. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|We {{explore the}} timing of {{deformation}} and exhumation of the Siviez-Mischabel Nappe (western Swiss Alps), which has been considered {{a classic example of}} a midcrustal crystalline nappe since the studies of Argand [1916]. This study presents Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 ages obtained on both synkinematic white mica from Permo-Triassic cover sediments and more complex white mica populations from basement gneisses of the Siviez-Mischabel and middle Pennine Nappes. Primary foliation developed in cover units by nucleation, growth, and rigid rotation of mica grains during noncoaxial Alpine deformation. Although some samples show a crenulation of this primary foliation, mica growth appears to have occurred only during the development of primary foliation, the main phase of greenschist facies deformation related to imbrication of the Siviez-Mischabel Nappe and other middle Pennine Nappes. Good agreement exists between independent estimates of {{the timing of}} deformation and reported Ar- 40 /Ar- 39, white mica ages from cover units of the central and southern Siviez-Mischabel Nappe. In cover units from the central and southern Siviez-Mischabel regions of the study area, Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 ages appear to date synkinematic white mica growth. Results suggest that the Siviez-Mischabel :Nappe was emplaced and developed foliation during a 5 m. y. period from 41 to 36 Ma. In cover units from the eastern Siviez-Mischabel, however, Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 white mica ages appear to date postkinematic thermal events. These thermal events may be related to Oligocene magmatic activity in the lower Pennine Nappes or to Miocene development of the Simplon fault zone. Variations in the relation between Alpine age and grain size for cover samples from the central, eastern, and southern Siviez-Mischabel correlate well with the regional variations in temperature inferred from quartz microfabrics and the pattern of regional metamorphism. When considered in concert with other recent isotopic studies on the timing of major tectonic and thermal events in the western Swiss Alps, these data support arguments that the relative timing of events such as thrusting and <b>back</b> <b>thrusting</b> of crystalline nappes in hinterland units and exhumation of high-pressure units in the suture zone of the western Alps are intimately related and synchronous on the scale of a few million years.

40|$|The Margala Hills and Hazara Ranges are the {{south-western}} {{continuation of}} the Hazara- Kashmir Syntaxis in North Pakistan, constituting an east-northeast trending fold-thrust belt of Jurassic to Eocene platform sediments, partially overlying Late Precambrian basement. The current field investigations have revealed that at least three macro-scale fold-thrust nappes, which are structurally linked to a regional basal detachment located at base-Hazara Slate, fabricate the structural grain of the Margala Hills and southeast Hazara Ranges. From north to south these nappes include the Hazara fold-thrust nappe which is exposed along Hazara Thrust. Below the Hazara nappe lays the Garamthun nappe which is exposed at surface along Garamthun Fault. Southeast of the Garamthun Fault the hanging wall sequence of the Main Boundary Thrust constitutes the third fold-thrust nappe of the area and constitute the foothills of Margala Hills. All these fold-thrust nappes are characterised by east-northeast trending major anticlinal folds detached {{at the level of}} Jurassic rocks. The stratigraphic set up of these fold-thrust nappes implies a gradual south younging of structuration of the study area. The lithostratigraphic offset along the mapped faults is very little and does not support large scale horizontal movements with the thrust faulting alone. The large scale fold-thrust belt allochthony is shared by fold nappe mechanism which is also believed to be responsible for the thickening of the sedimentary pile. Mesoscopic and macroscopic folds data indicate the presence of at least three distinct lines of folding including northeast-southwest followed by southeast and north-south trends. The northwest-southeast compression is the prominent grain of the southeast Hazara and Margala Hills. Mesoscopic fault planes can be categorised into three distinct sets. The most prominent is the top to the southeast followed by top to the west-northwest and northeast. The top the southeast set is consistent with the movement direction on the macroscopic scale faults (Hazara Thrust, Garamthun Fault and Main Boundary Thrust) and the pitch data is suggestive of a dominant thrust slip motion in addition to left lateral strike slip adjustments. The second set that is the top to the west-northwest can be considered as the <b>back</b> <b>thrusting</b> phenomenon associated with the top to the southeast major displacement. The third set and a few other less prominent fault planes are generally oriented discordant to set one and two and indicate the transpressional related adjustments of the region. Most of dips in the hanging wall of Main Boundary Thrust are found to be overturned to the northwest and the axial planes of the folds mostly dip southeast. This back folding is most prominent and consistent along the hanging wall of Main Boundary Thrust and gradually defuse in the northwest direction. The synthesis of the structural data indicate that in the whole Miocene southward directed major shortening created a southwards propagating, flat-ramp thrust fault, cutting up section. This basal thrust carried the Margala Hills Mesozoic and part of its Murree cover towards the south above thicker Murree molasse and underlying Northern Potwar Deformed Zone Mesozoic nappes. Increased shortening took place by tight folding of the hanging wall. This could be the main reason of folds found in the Margala Hills. Late (?) Pliocene major, crustal or lithospheric scale folding created the Hazara Kashmir Syntaxis and created north-south to northeast-southwest axis folds in the Margala Hills. This event is responsible in the first instance for the east or west verging structures in the whole area, for the northwards or northwestwards overturned folds of the Margala Hills; and for the major crustal thickening and subsequent very important uplift of the whole area. The same event could have created strike slip faulting. Repeated south verging thrusting in Quaternary resulted in the southwards movement of the Salt Range above Pleistocene sediments, and flat, mostly south verging thrust faults cutting the older structures. This last event may have generated deeper ramps in the Northern Potwar Deformed Zone and may have formed folds and uplifts in the Northern Potwar deformed Zone and beneath the frontal part of Margala Hills. Strike slip faulting may accompany this event, together with gravitational collapse-induced normal faulting...|$|E

The proposed methodology relies on the maximum strength theorem which is inherited from the kinematic approach of the classical limit analysis. It selects the optimum virtual velocity field which minimizes the tectonic force. These velocity fields are constructed by interpolation thanks to the spatial discretization conducted with ten-noded tetrahedra in 3 D and six-noded triangles in 2 D. The resulting, discrete optimization problem is first presented emphasizing the dual formalism found most appropriate {{in the presence of}} nonlinear strength criteria, such as the Drucker–Prager criterion used in all reported examples. The numerical scheme is first applied to a perfectly triangular 2 D wedge.

40|$|International {{audience}} 1. Introduction[1] Leloup et al. [2005] {{discussed the}} Cenozoic structural {{evolution of the}} Mont Blanc and Aiguilles Rouges ranges by combining new structural, 0 Ar/ 39 Ar, and fission track data with published P-T estimates and geochronological data. Our main conclusions were (1) Alpine exhumation of the Aiguilles Rouges {{was limited to the}} thickness of the overlying nappes (10 km), while rocks now outcropping in the Mont Blanc have been xhumed 15 to 20 km. (2) Uplift of the two massifs started 22 Myr ago; while at 12 Ma, the Mont Blanc shear zone (MBsz), a reverse fault with a slight right-lateral component, initiated bringing the Mont Blanc above the Chamonix synclinorium and the Aiguilles Rouges; total vertical throw on the MBsz isbetween 4 and 8 km. (3) Fission track data suggest that relative motion between the Aiguilles Rouges and the Mont Blanc stopped 4 Myr ago. Since that time, uplift of the Mont Blanc has mostly taken place along the Mont Blanc <b>back</b> <b>thrust,</b> a steep north dipping fault zone bounding thesouthern flank of the range. (4) The highest summits are located where the <b>back</b> <b>thrust</b> intersects the MBsz. (5) Exhumation of the Mont Blanc and Aiguilles Rouges occurred toward the end of motion on the Helvetic basal de´collement (HBD) {{at the base of the}} Helvetic nappes. Uplift is linked with a deeper, more external thrust that induced the formation of the Jura arc. [2] While acknowledging that our paper is ‘‘a good step forward in the tectonic comprehension of the Mont Blanc area and provides a good synthesis of preexisting data,’’Rolland et al. [2007] claim that the timing we propose for the <b>thrust</b> and <b>back</b> <b>thrust</b> events is not in agreement with new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar data that they publish in their comment. In fact, they raise two main arguments with our observations/ interpretations:[3] 1. Alpine deformation is penetrative within the Mont blanc granite and is not accommodated by the two localized shear zones we describe (the SE dipping Mont Blanc shear zone, or MBsz, in the north and the NW dipping <b>back</b> <b>thrust</b> in the south, Figure 1), but by numerous anastomosed shearzones in the way described by Choukroune and Gapais [1983] in the Aar massif and Gourlay [1986] in the Mont Blanc. All deformations within the Mont Blanc are thus coeval and the Mont Blanc is a transpressive pop-up structure at the rim of a large transpressive fault that runs from the Rhone dextral fault system. [4] 2. The timing of deformation cannot be obtained through 40 Ar/ 39 Ar thermochronology due to excess argon and intense fluid circulation. They instead provide a minimum age of 16 Ma for the initiation of top to the SE motions on the SE side of the Mont Blanc (<b>back</b> <b>thrust)</b> based on five phengites 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages from three shear zones (their Figure 3).

The failure mode is char- acterized by the activation of a ramp, its conjugate <b>back</b> <b>thrust,</b> and the partial or complete activation of the décollement. It is shown that the critical slope is captured precisely by the proposed numerical scheme, the ramp, and the <b>back</b> <b>thrust</b> corresponding to regions of localized virtual strain. The influence of the back- wall friction on this critical slope is explored. It is found that the failure mechanism reduces to a thrust rooting {{at the base of the}} back wall and the absence of <b>back</b> <b>thrust,</b> for small enough values of the friction angle. This influence is well explained by the Mohr construction and further validated with experimental results with sand, considered as an analog material. 3 D applications of the same methodology are presented in a companion paper...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The <b>back</b> <b>thrust</b> kick is a karate {{technique}} used primarily in a defensive setting. This research described the kinematic variables {{involved in the}} skilled execution of the kick. Variables examined included movement sequencing, angular position of the trunk, thigh and leg, angular velocity of the thigh and leg, linear velocity at the ankle and duration of the kick. High speed cinematography was used to film seven subjects as they performed three trials of the <b>back</b> <b>thrust</b> kick. Subjects were highly skilled black belts, four males and three females. Digitizing and computer analysis were done to obtain the variables needed for quantitative analysis. Visual analysis of the film and of graphs showing the quantitative data {{were used for the}} qualitative analysis. The two sample t-test and nonparametric Mann-Whitney analyses were used to compare the influence of gender upon the kinematic variables. Data did not support the hypotheses of significant differences occurring as a function of gender among the variables analyzed. All subjects performed the kick in a similar fashion with males exhibiting minor variations in form during the extension phase of the kick. The major educational implication derived from this research is the necessity to adapt instructional techniques and methods for populations which may vary by gender, height, weight and segment lengths...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} is {{to demonstrate that the}} equilibrium element method (EEM) provides the stress distribution in geometrical models of folds, relevant to fold-and-thrust belts as well as accretionary wedges. The core of the method, inherited from limit analysis, is the search for an optimum stress field that (1) is in equilibrium, (2) remains everywhere below or equal to the maximum strength of the rock, and (3) balances the largest possible applied tectonic force. This force and the associated stress field are interpreted as those at the onset of rupture. The method makes no appeal to the rock rheology nor to its elasticity, except for its maximum strength described here with the Coulomb criterion. The stress fields are discretized by elements covering the whole domain and allowing for discontinuities. The example chosen to illustrate the potential of the EEM and to validate our implementation is the thrusting of a rectangular sheet over a flat and weak décollement. The EEM reproduces the solution proposed by Hafner (1951) on the basis of linear elasticity, as long as the strength limit is not reached in the bulk of the domain. The EEM shows in addition that failure in the bulk prevents the activation of the décollement. The EEM is then applied to two fault-bend folds, with known ramp and flat décollement, with and without relief buildup. It is shown that the transition from the flat to the ramp hanging walls occurs through a narrow fan defining the <b>back</b> <b>thrust.</b> The predicted dip of this <b>back</b> <b>thrust</b> decreases with increase in the ramp friction angle, the relief buildup, as well as the ramp curvature. A sharp increase and then a sharp decrease in the magnitudes of the equivalent shear stress and of the mean stress are observed as one moves from the lower flat, through the <b>back</b> <b>thrust</b> up the ramp. If the ramp friction angle is too large, or the relief too important, the EEM predicts the initiation of a new thrust rooting at the back wall, instead of activating the proposed ramp. The application to detect the incipient thrust system within the toe of Nankai's accretionary wedge, southeast coast of Japan, is proposed in the auxiliary material...|$|R
