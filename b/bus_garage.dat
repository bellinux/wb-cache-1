5|$|The {{substation}} {{was proposed}} in the early 2000s, during redevelopment of South Lake Union into a high-tech hub. A former Greyhound <b>bus</b> <b>garage</b> was acquired by Seattle City Light and demolished in 2014. Construction on the Denny Substation, including a street vacation to close part of Pontius Avenue, began in 2016 and {{is scheduled to be}} completed in 2018, at a cost of $210 million.|$|E
5|$|After {{the school}} closed in 1953, the larger, {{original}} room was {{converted into a}} <b>bus</b> <b>garage</b> by the Chana School District. A large garage door was cut into {{the building and the}} floor completely removed. The smaller, 1893 room became a storage area. In 1962, the Chana School District ran out of room and used the building as an overflow classroom. By the mid-1960s, the Chana District folded and was absorbed by the Oregon School District. Residents were allowed to remove any items from the school after the district shut down.|$|E
5|$|Seattle City Light {{proposed}} demolishing the Greyhound <b>bus</b> <b>garage</b> on Denny Way {{for its new}} substation in 2006, with consultants {{recommending that}} the city acquire the site for $40 million as soon as possible. The site was purchased by Seattle City Light in October 2008 and vacated by Greyhound in 2010. From 2012 to 2014, Seattle City Light demolished the Greyhound facility and removed contaminated soils in preparation for construction. During the period between environmental cleanup {{and the start of}} construction, the vacant lot was used for a series of temporary public art installations collectively called All Rise.|$|E

5|$|McNichol {{was born}} in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. His father, Danny, {{died when he was}} five, so McNichol and seven {{siblings}} were raised by their mother, Catherine. He attended St Joseph's School in Kilmarnock, and started work as a messenger boy for a local draper's shop when he left school. His shop work stopped him playing football on Saturdays, but he was able to play some midweek football for Junior club Hurlford United. When he was taken on at the local <b>bus</b> <b>garage</b> as an apprentice motor mechanic, he became available on Saturdays as well. Hurlford paid him ten shillings a game, nearly as much as his apprentice's wages. During the Second World War, McNichol was called up to the Fleet Air Arm as a mechanic, but was able to play friendly matches for Inverness-based club Clachnacuddin. Because of the number of professional players stationed around the country, such matches were played at a fairly high standard.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time as this foray into the everyday, outlandish {{projects}} were designed such as Ivan Leonidov's Lenin Institute, a high tech work that bears comparison with Buckminster Fuller. This consisted of a skyscraper-sized library, a planetarium and dome, all linked together by a monorail; or Georgy Krutikov's self-explanatory Flying City, an ASNOVA project that was intended as a serious proposal for airborne housing. Melnikov House and his Bakhmetevsky <b>Bus</b> <b>Garage</b> are fine examples of the tensions between individualism and utilitarianism in Constructivism.|$|E
25|$|Amongst {{other things}} this {{recommended}} a curator be appointed for the Commission’s holdings (John M. Scholes), retention of the York museum, creation of other regional museums (not {{carried out in}} the way proposed), a small relics display in the old Great Hall at Euston railway station (done on a temporary basis) and a large museum of collections elsewhere in London. For the latter, the former station at Nine Elms was originally favoured as a site, but what was eventually opened in 1961 was the Museum of British Transport in a former <b>bus</b> <b>garage</b> in Clapham.|$|E
25|$|By 1950 {{the depot}} had {{changed its name}} to Clapton to avoid {{confusion}} with the nearby Well Street garage (H) prior to being converted for motorbus operation. Following the conversion the parking area allowed for 90 buses and in 1959 67 RTLs were allocated as part of the trolleybus replacement programme. Over the years the garage has seen various types allocated including RT, RM, DMS, M and Ts, but in 1987 with just a few MCW Metrobuses and AEC Routemasters remaining the garage was closed with the remaining work transferred to the newer Ash Grove <b>bus</b> <b>garage.</b>|$|E
