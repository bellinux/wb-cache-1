5|$|The Russian {{army that}} crossed the Lithuanian border in early October 1632 had <b>been</b> <b>carefully</b> {{prepared}} and {{was under the}} experienced command of Mikhail Borisovich Shein, who had previously defended Smolensk against the Poles during the 1609–1611 siege. Several towns and castles fell as the Russians advanced, and on 28 October 1632 (the same day that the historic town of Dorogobuzh was taken), Shein moved to begin the siege of Smolensk.|$|E

5|$|For {{greatest}} {{efficiency and}} best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers {{can be placed}} {{in a corner of the}} room, far from large room openings, and closer to the listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have <b>been</b> <b>carefully</b> mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel is out of phase with another.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1860s and 1870s, Wallace was very {{concerned}} about the financial security of his family. While he was in the Malay Archipelago, the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money, which had <b>been</b> <b>carefully</b> invested by the agent who sold the specimens for Wallace. However, on his return to the UK, Wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money, and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of The Malay Archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Kalimpong is also {{famous for}} their rich {{practice}} of cactus cultivation. Its nurseries attract people from far and wide for the absolutely stunning collection of cacti they cultivate. The strains of cacti, though not indigenous to the locale, have <b>been</b> <b>carefully</b> cultivated over the years, and now the town boasts {{one of the most}} fascinating and exhaustive collections of the Cactaceae family. The plants have adapted well to the altitude and environment, and now prove {{to be one of the}} chief draws of tourism to the township.|$|E

5|$|The {{behavior}} {{of matter and}} energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined physical laws. These laws have been employed to produce cosmological models that successfully explain the structure {{and the evolution of}} the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty physical constants that appear to be static across the observable universe. The values of these constants have <b>been</b> <b>carefully</b> measured, but the reason for their specific values remains a mystery.|$|E
5|$|The name Giacomo Meyerbeer {{first became}} known internationally with his opera Il crociato in Egitto—premiered in Venice in 1824 and {{produced}} in London and Paris in 1825; incidentally, {{it was the}} last opera ever written to feature a castrato, and the last to require keyboard accompaniment for recitatives. This 'breakthrough' in Paris was exactly what Meyerbeer had been aiming for over the past ten years; he had <b>been</b> <b>carefully</b> preparing for it, developing contacts, and fully reaped his reward.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of each colossal head must have <b>been</b> <b>carefully</b> planned, given {{the effort required}} to ensure the necessary resources were available; {{it seems likely that}} only the more powerful Olmec rulers were able to mobilise such resources. The workforce would have included sculptors, labourers, overseers, boatmen, woodworkers and other artesans producing the tools to make and move the monument, in addition to the support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers. The seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the {{production of}} the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end.|$|E

5|$|The Russian {{army that}} crossed the Lithuanian border in early October 1632 had <b>been</b> <b>carefully</b> {{prepared}} and {{was under the}} experienced command of Mikhail Shein, who had previously defended Smolensk against the Poles during the 1609–1611 siege. Estimates {{of the size of}} the Russian forces vary, from 20,000 through 25,000 and 30,000 to 34,500, with 160 artillery pieces. However, the numbers over 25,000 give the overall number of Shein's army when leaving Moscow. A part of this army was left behind as garrisons in newly conquered cities as Dorogobuzh, Belaya and others. Based on the archive documents, the Russian historian Menshikov gives the initial number of Shein's army at Smolensk as 24,000 men but indicates that the number reduced to 20,000 by August when many Russian soldiers left the army to protect their estates endangered by the Crimean khan's summer raid on South Russia.|$|E
