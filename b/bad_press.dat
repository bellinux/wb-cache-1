5|$|By 1914 the non-militant {{elements}} of the suffrage movement had built up a steady presence and, although damaged by the <b>bad</b> <b>press</b> violent action brought, they also gained from the publicity. A summer school {{had been set up}} by the NUWSS in the Conwy Valley the previous year and now their members were benefitting from the training in public speaking that was given. In south Wales signs of working-class involvement in the suffrage cause took shape through the Women's Co-operative Guild, with a branch opening in Ton Pentre in the Rhondda in 1914 run by Elizabeth Andrews.|$|E

In the first case, dubbed the Biscari massacre, American troops from C Company, 180th Infantry Regiment, were alleged to have shot 74 Italian and two German prisoners in Acate in July 1943 following the capture of an airfield in the area. Lieutenant General George Patton, the Seventh Army commander, asked Major General Omar Bradley, commanding II Corps, to get the case dismissed to prevent <b>bad</b> <b>press,</b> but Bradley refused. A non-commissioned officer later confessed to the crimes and was found guilty, but an officer who claimed he had only been following orders was acquitted.|$|E

5|$|Riley {{began his}} career writing verses as a sign maker and {{submitting}} poetry to newspapers. Thanks in part to an endorsement from poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, he eventually earned successive jobs at Indiana newspaper publishers during the latter 1870s. Riley gradually rose in prominence during the 1880s through his poetry reading tours. He traveled a touring circuit first in the Midwest, and then nationally, holding shows and making joint appearances on stage with other famous talents. Riley was an alcoholic, never married or had children, and created a scandal in 1888 when he became too drunk to perform. He became more popular {{in spite of the}} <b>bad</b> <b>press</b> he received, and as a result extricated himself from poorly negotiated contracts that limited his earnings; he quickly became very wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) arrives {{to report}} on the festival and is {{determined}} to find a negative story, although she does show excitement over Li'l Sebastian. She initially fails to find a scandal, but then overhears Leslie and Ben discussing the curse. It becomes the focus of her story, especially after Tom (Aziz Ansari) tells Leslie that Li'l Sebastian escaped his pen. Tom blames Jerry (Jim O'Heir), although it was entirely Tom's fault. The Pawnee media swarms the festival to cover the curse, endangering its opening the next day with the <b>bad</b> <b>press,</b> with one reporter likening Ben's past as a failed teen mayor with the curse. Now believing himself to be the curse, Ben leaves the festival. As Leslie reassures the reporters there is no curse, the power generator blows out, leaving the festival dark and stranding most of the parks department on a Ferris wheel. Using the blackout as an excuse, Ann takes Donna's advice to make out with Kiley (Joey Russo), her dumb but attractive patient.|$|E
5|$|At Marsh's urging, Powell {{pushed for}} Cope to return {{specimens}} he had unearthed during his employment under the government surveys. This was an outrage to Cope, {{who had used}} his own money {{while working as a}} volunteer. In response, Cope went to the editor of the New York Herald and promised a scandalous headline. Since 1885, Cope had kept an elaborate journal of mistakes and misdeeds that both Marsh and Powell had committed over the years. From scientific errors to publishing mistakes, he had them written down in a journal he kept in the bottom drawer of his Pine Street desk. Cope sought out Marsh's assistants, who complained of being denied access and credit by their employer and of being chronically underpaid. Reporter William Hosea Ballou ran the first article on January 12, 1890, in what would become a series of newspaper debates between Marsh, Powell, and Cope. Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell published their own side of the story and, in the end, little changed. No congressional hearing was created to investigate Powell's alleged misallocation of funds, while Cope and Marsh were not held responsible for any mistakes. Indirectly, however, the attacks may have been influential in Marsh's fall from power in the survey. Due to pressure from Powell over <b>bad</b> <b>press,</b> Marsh was removed from his position for the government surveys. Cope's relations {{with the president of the}} University of Pennsylvania soured, and the entire funding for paleontology in the government surveys was pulled.|$|E

50|$|The trial {{seemed to}} be going Caroline's way, {{especially}} after Sacchi's testimony was refuted by the nephew of the Duchess of Torlonia, Carlo Forti. Forti claimed that the Countess Oldi (Pergami's sister) sat between Caroline and Pergami in the carriage, which was also shared with Victorine (Pergami's daughter), and so there could have been no intimacy between them. However, the cross-examination of two of the witnesses damaged Caroline's case. Lieutenant John Flynn and Joseph Hownam had both been on the same Mediterranean cruise with Caroline and Pergami. Flynn said nothing incriminating but {{during the course of the}} cross-examination, he fainted, which left a <b>bad</b> impression. <b>Pressed</b> by Gifford, Hownam admitted that Caroline and Pergami had both slept in the same tent on deck because, he claimed, Caroline was afraid of pirates, and wanted a guard in the tent with her. In an attempt to regain ground, Brougham produced two Italian witnesses, Giuseppe Giroline and Filippo Pomi, who revealed that the prosecution witnesses had been paid 40 francs each, and given free food and board. The Whigs now claimed that the trial was tainted as there was prima facie evidence of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by paying witnesses for their testimony. Lord Liverpool countered Whig demands to abandon the bill by saying that there was other evidence, from non-Italian witnesses, that could be relied upon.|$|R

25|$|With two {{controversial}} races, {{the trip}} to England generated both bad feelings and <b>bad</b> <b>press</b> for Courtney and the Cornell rowing team. The controversial first heat with Leander caused ill will in England with many considering that Cornell acted in an unsportsmanlike manner. Courtney believed he received good treatment from the fans at Henley, and was mistreated by the English press. Courtney also {{had to contend with}} <b>bad</b> <b>press</b> back home. Courtney believed that part of the problem was the rivalry between competing wire services. C. S. Francis, a Cornell alumni who helped raise money for {{the trip to}} England, was also the editor of the Troy Times, which was associated with United Press. Francis stayed with the Cornell team and helped out United Press reporters with information about the team. The Chicago Associated Press wanted to have their own representative. When this was denied, Courtney claimed that they tried to get even. Courtney insisted that several things that Chicago Associated Press reported, such as troubles and disagreements between members of the team and Mr. Francis' saying the drawing of the Leander rowing club was fixed, were fabrications. After the regatta, the members of the Cornell rowing team released a statement to the press to address the matter of the Leander race. It stated that it was their understanding that under the rules if they stopped they would have been disqualified. They also said they would consider another race with Leander if they would have won.|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} EEG experiments we {{have presented}} a time estimation task to our subjects, who <b>bad</b> to <b>press</b> a button {{with either the}} left or right index finger 3 s after an auditory warning stimulus (WS). Two seconds later a visual Knowledge of Results (KR) stimulus was presented on a screen in front, informing them about whether the movement had been made in the correct time window (a vertical line), whether it was too early (a minus sign) or too late (a plus sign). The potential distribution underlying the anticipatory attention for the KR stimulus suggested a right hemisphere network in which the prefrontal cortex, the insula Reili and the parietal cortex were involved. In the present positron emission tomography (PET) activation study we aimed to further localize the exact positions of these regions, using the same paradigm. Two conditions were compared in which the WS had to be followed by a button press with the left index finger. In experimental condition A, subjects received true information about their performance, while in condition B false information was given, utilizing the same stimuli, but randomly, thus without any relation to the actual performance. In both conditions identical stimuli were presented and identical movements were made. Therefore we applied statistical parameter mapping (SPM) for comparison of condition A with B in order to identify regional increases in perfusion related to the anticipation and use of the KR. We found in line with our predictions a right hemisphere activation of (1) BA 45, (2) the junction of the posterior insula with the temporal transverse gyrus and (3) the posterior part of the parietal cortex. This activation pattern was accompanied by a better performance due to KR. A second, though not predicted, effect was the increase in correct responses during the last two sessions compared to the first two sessions, independent of KR. This learning effect was accompanied by an activation of BA 46 and the supplementary motor area (SMA), again in the right hemisphere. Summarizing, two different prefrontal areas in the right hemisphere were activated: a more ventral area, related to the use of external stimuli providing feedback about a past performance, in order to produce movements in time, and another mid-dorsal one, related to temporal programming on the basis of internal cues...|$|R
