50|$|On 11 December 2012, CSL Tadoussac {{collided}} with a pier on the Maumee River in Toledo, Ohio. Her <b>bunker</b> <b>tank</b> was pierced.|$|E
50|$|All the engine's {{water was}} {{carried in the}} front <b>bunker</b> <b>tank</b> and in the large underbelly tank, each tank with a {{capacity}} of 2640 imp gal. The rear bunker carried only coal and had a capacity of 14 lt t. The main frame therefore carried the smokebox, boiler, firebox, cab and coal bunker, {{as well as the}} underbelly water tank.|$|E
50|$|An inquiry {{found that}} safety {{practices}} were ignored when repairs {{were carried out}} on the vessel. Sparks from the cutting torch used during repairs caused a fire, which ignited an explosive vapour mixture within the aft starboard <b>bunker</b> <b>tank</b> of the vessel. The fuel tank had been contaminated by crude oil. The explosion ruptured the common bulkhead between the tank and the engine room, releasing the burning oil into the engine room and setting it on fire, killing the workers there instantly.|$|E
50|$|During the enquiry {{after the}} ship's loss, it was {{stated that the}} ship lost power due to {{seawater}} contamination of the ship's heavy fuel oil on 3 January. This occurred after a pipeline on the deck broke loose, allowing seawater to enter the vessel's <b>bunker</b> <b>tanks</b> via broken air vents. The loss of power caused the crew to lose control of the ship during a storm.|$|R
5000|$|Initially four {{locomotives}} were ordered, {{and they}} were numbered 271-274. These Garratts were built with a [...] "semi-streamlined" [...] rounded front <b>bunker</b> (water <b>tank),</b> that would become synonymous with modern Garratt locomotives.|$|R
50|$|On September 15, 1944, {{an attack}} is planned on Canrobert sector and Kellermann {{to the north}} and Jeanne D'Arc on the {{southern}} sector. The approach is difficult, German soldiers defending inch by inch. American bazookas have no effect on the concrete <b>bunkers,</b> <b>tanks,</b> followed by armed sections of flamethrowers, throw themselves on the first German lines, not reaching nor neutralizing them, nor taking them. General McLain then concludes a sector frontal attack would be doomed to failure and ordered his troops to keep the pressure on the outposts 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division without attacking frontally forts Jeanne D'Arc and Lorraine.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the rear}} bunker carried only coal, an {{additional}} large underbelly water tank under the boiler {{compensated for the}} resulting diminished water capacity. All the engine's water was carried in the front <b>bunker</b> <b>tank</b> and in the underbelly water tank, with a combined capacity of 6000 imp gal, while the rear bunker had a coal capacity of 13 lt 10 lcwt t. The main frame therefore carried the smokebox, boiler, firebox, cab, coal bunker, {{as well as the}} underbelly water tank.|$|E
5000|$|Bunker fuel or bunker crude is {{technically}} {{any type of}} fuel oil used aboard vessels. It gets {{its name from the}} tanks on ships and in ports that it is stored in; {{in the early days of}} steam they were coal bunkers but now they are bunker fuel tanks. The Australian Customs and the Australian Tax Office define a bunker fuel as the fuel that powers the engine of a ship or aircraft. Bunker A is No. 2 fuel oil, bunker B is No. 4 or No. 5 and bunker C is No. 6. Since No. 6 is the most common, [...] "bunker fuel" [...] is often used as a synonym for No. 6. No. 5 fuel oil is also called Navy Special Fuel Oil (NSFO) or just navy special; No. 5 or 6 are also commonly called heavy fuel oil (HFO) or furnace fuel oil (FFO); the high viscosity requires heating, usually by a recirculated low pressure steam system, before the oil can be pumped from a <b>bunker</b> <b>tank.</b> Bunkers are rarely labeled this way in modern maritime practice.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{investigating}} {{upon the}} influence on bulk carrier {{design of the}} new regulations concerning prevention of oil spills from bunker tanks. At first {{a brief review of}} the incoming amendments to the MARPOL 73 / 78 regulations will be performed. Within such context reference will be made to both the deterministic and the probabilistic approaches. A case study will be therefore carried out taking as reference a recently built Panamax size bulk carrier ship: the most appropriate solutions in terms of <b>bunker</b> <b>tank</b> arrangement will be sought to ensure the required level of environmental safety to be guaranteed. The relative effectiveness of the proposed design solutions will be explored using the probabilistic oil outflow analysis technique as implemented in the latest amendments of the incoming MARPOL 73 / 78 regulations. Starting from the analysis of the considered rules and the results of the proposed case study, some suggestions will be given concerning the development of guidelines for <b>bunker</b> <b>tank</b> arrangement in bulk carrier ships...|$|E

40|$|Analyses {{of thirty}} years of US and {{international}} marine oil spill data have revealed that spillage rates have generally decreased despite overall increases in oil production and transportation (Etkin, 2001). At the same time, occasional large spills ─ along with increasing expectations of effective spill response ─ have necessitated complex contingency planning for increasingly rare high-impact events. Past oil spill trends for vessels from 1985 - 2000 and potential future spill rates in light of improvements implementation of double hulls on tankers and <b>bunker</b> <b>tanks</b> are analyzed with regard to future contingency planning needs in the US. A methodology for determining theoretical and most-likely worst-case oil spill scenarios for contingency planning for ports will be described. ...|$|R
5000|$|ENOC {{produces}} about 100,000 {{barrels of}} crude per {{day from the}} Turkmenistan oilfield and owns and operates the 140,000 bpd Jebel Ali refinery {{as well as more}} than 115 service stations throughout the UAE. The company claims volume sales of 245 million barrels oil equivalent in 2016. While about 45 million to 50 million barrels of sales were accounted for by its physical operations, the bulk of its sales volume - nearly 200 million barrels of oil equivalent - was accounted for by its trading arm, which operates out of offices in Dubai, Singapore and London, and trades derivatives, such as [...] "paper barrels" [...] and oil futures, as well as physical oil.

40|$|Oil spills from {{maritime}} activities can have detrimental effects to marine ecosystems and cause economic damages both to ship operators and to coastal communities. One widely used approach {{for reducing the}} adverse effects of possible oil spills is maritime oil spill risk assessment and response preparedness planning. It is widely acknowledged that especially ship collisions and groundings pose {{a high risk of}} oil spills, both in navigation in open water and in conditions characterized by sea ice. Correspondingly, comparatively much research has been dedicated to estimating the oil spill sizes in ship collision and grounding accidents in risk assessment and response preparedness planning contexts. Nevertheless, most of these methods provide rather crude estimates of the spill sizes, or have a limited scope of application when more detailed estimates are produced. Hence, comprehensive methods for determining the oil outflow consequences in ship collision and grounding accidents are still lacking. Such consequences models could however be useful for response authorities to determine the target spill size for a given sea area and plan the necessary resources for responding to such a spill. In order to increase the realism of consequence models of accidental oil outflow in ship collision and grounding accidents, it is necessary to combine different data sources and models of specific phenomena. For a given accidental impact scenario, the damage extent inflicted to the struck ship hull needs to be evaluated, and subsequently the oil outflow should be assessed in the specific environmental context. The hull damage extent and the oil outflow are conditional to the ship layout and the loading condition. Integrated modeling approaches combining these elements have been proposed. However, a comprehensive dataset of the required information about the ship main dimensions and cargo and <b>bunker</b> <b>tank</b> details for the accidental damage extent assessment and oil outflow in particular scenarios is still lacking. The aim of this report is to fill this gap by presenting information on vessel particulars of selected vessel types, with a focus on tankers, bulk carriers and container vessels. The scope is typical vessels navigating in the Northern Baltic Sea area. These vessels are selected based on an analysis of the vessel traffic in this area, based on data from the Automatic Identification System. To facilitate risk analyses based on the presented information, the report also contains a strength-of-evidence assessment...|$|E
40|$|LNG {{shipping}} is tracking {{back to the}} 1950 s, and has {{for more}} than half a century been finding promising. It is not until the last years LNG has been taken into commercial shipping as a fuel, and more widely considered a future main source of energy. This is due to important factors such as shale gas production together with increasing oil prices and pressure for green fuel by states and authorities. Within the new 10 year period, several key harbor areas will have strict limitations in term of fuel being used by the ships. There are various technical solutions on the market to reduce the emissions from an oil fueled engine. However, as the oil price is predicted to further increase a change of energy source could be profitable. LNG has a lower energy density than fuel oil and requires also tank isolation to keep it at - 163 °C. Together with limitations in where it can be installed in the vessel from the class societies makes it less energy dense as similar amounts of bunker oil. This is considered one of the main disadvantages for it to be used in ships. As found, there are solutions that can be used in order to overcome the downside of LNG being less energy dense than fuel oil. This can be as I have found, to either increase the number of bunkering operations, the governments can install offshore bunkering stations, and one can either take space from cargo decks, redesign ship volumes, or add configurations for removable LNG tanks onboard, used when sailing longer distances. Ongoing development in membrane tanks will also increase the energy density, together with changes in the classification societies rules and regulations. From studying the ship operation pattern and engine loads, I found that the consumption of fuel oil compared to fuel oil volumes is relatively low. Today, the vessels have a capacity of sailing for about 2 months without bunkering. Still, I have seen and experienced that a bunkering operation is not an issue, and only requires some additional planning. On this basis and picture of the general arrangement and stability data I have found different solutions that will have different effects depending on several factors, such as future fuel price and operational pattern. In the lean burn gas solution, the design would have to take a volume of 1. 500 [m 3] from the cargo space to be able to reach between the longest sea stretches, being from Japan to South America. The cost of lost opportunity will depend highly of the degree of utilization of deck 1. As long as it is under 65 %, there will be no cost of lost opportunity. Utilization over this will give an added cost, depending of the freight rates and utilization degree. I found that this solution actually would be profitable as long as LNG is about 10 % cheaper than HFO for assumptions regarding operation profile and the mentioned utilization and rates. Since the LNG 2 -stroke engine is significantly decreasing in efficiency below 60 - 70 % load, it is likely to be beneficial with shaft generators installed. The size of the main engine would again depend on load and operation. Another solution is to add extra fuel tanks when crossing the pacific. This will not result in a cost of lost opportunity if the vessel is sailing in other trades. This concept would also be easily loaded and discharged as the tanks can be rolled on and off, with the ramp supporting 150 tons. The other solution I found is that the existing <b>bunker</b> <b>tank</b> volume included in Höeghs ships is sufficient for the vessel to operate on a dual fuel configuration, with more than 400 tons LNG and 675 tons HFO onboard. If it is possible to add HFO in the volume underneath the LNG-tanks, the total volumes of the two fuels could be 500 tons LNG and 1900 tons of fuel oil. The dual fuel engines are said to be 4 % less efficient from statement from engine makers, when operation on HFO mode compared to a pure diesel engine. In conclusion, the dual fuel design is profitable if the LNG costs are between MDO and HFO-price, and the design will also add values that might also give motivation behind the choice, such as redundancy in the fuel system and a lower climate footprint. If the LNG price is lower than HFO, a purely LNG solution is found to be most likely economical. </p...|$|E

5000|$|By {{the time}} of the Gulf War, the {{capabilities}} of [...] "smart" [...] aeroplanes dropping unguided bombs from low altitudes were sufficient to place an munition within 30 ft of a target. However, Iraqi air defenses in the Kuwait theater of operations, characterized by large numbers of man-portable air-defense systems, larger surface-to-air missiles and rapid-firing light anti-aircraft guns, would not permit low altitude operatings. Operations from medium altitudes (15,000 ft and higher) at longer slant ranges severely complicated bombing accuracy, particularly against targets that required a direct hit to be destroyed, such as hangars, <b>bunkers,</b> <b>tanks,</b> and artillery. As one analytical study concluded: [...] "Medium and high-altitude bombing with unguided munitions posed problems, even with digital smart platforms. Using smart platforms to deliver dumb bombs against point targets smaller than the circular error probable (CEP) may well require redundant targeting." ...|$|R

50|$|One {{characteristic}} of the locomotive was a design fault that caused it to derail. The problem would only occur when the locomotive was travelling smokebox first over facing hand operated points, usually {{to be found in}} colliery sidings, marshalling yards and the dock area. The rear coupled wheels, nearest the bunker, would force the tongue of the point open, causing the trailing bogie not to follow the driving wheels but to take the wrong road. These points had the disadvantage of not having a locking mechanism which could be found on facing points on the main line. At its worst, the result could be derailment, one example being that of No 147 which when entering Barry Sidings with a coal train from Coity, ended up on its side. Less severe but nonetheless serious damage could also be sustained. If the balancing pipe between the side and <b>bunker</b> <b>tanks</b> became fractured, the tanks would lose water rapidly and the fire would have to be dropped to prevent a boiler explosion. In practical terms, the crews would usually solve the problem by having the fireman hold on to the point lever while the driver took the locomotive through the point extremely slowly. Several engineering solutions were attempted both on the locomotive and on the track to overcome the problem but never fully successfully.|$|R
