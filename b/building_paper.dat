50|$|<b>Building</b> <b>papers</b> and {{membranes}} {{are used}} for many reasons in construction. One of the oldest <b>building</b> <b>papers</b> is red rosin paper which {{was known to be}} in use before 1850 and was used as an underlayment in exterior walls, roofs, and floors and for protecting a jobsite during construction. Tar paper was invented late in the 19th century and was used for similar purposes as rosin paper and for gravel roofs. Tar paper has largely fallen out of use supplanted by asphalt felt paper. Felt paper has been supplanted in some uses by synthetic underlayments, particularly in roofing by synthetic underlayments and siding by housewraps.|$|R

50|$|Tar {{paper is}} more {{accurately}} a Grade D <b>building</b> <b>paper</b> (the Grade D designation derives {{from a federal}} specification in the United States), which is widely used in the West. <b>Building</b> <b>paper</b> is manufactured from virgin kraft paper, unlike felts, and then impregnated with asphalt. The longer fibres in the kraft paper allow for a lighter weight product with similar and often better mechanical properties than felt. Grade papers are rated in minutes—the {{amount of time it}} takes for a moisture sensitive chemical indicator to change colour when a small boat-like sample is floated on water. Common grades include 10, 20, 30, and 60 minute. The higher the rating the more moisture resistant and the heavier. A typical 20 minute paper will weigh about 3.3 lbs per square, a 30-minute paper 3.75, and a 60-minute paper about six. The smaller volume of material however does tend to make these papers less resistant to moisture than heavier felts.|$|E

5000|$|Found on some {{plantations}} {{in every}} southern state, plantation schoolhouses {{served as a}} place for the hired tutor or governess to educate the planter's children, and sometimes even those of other planters in the area. [...] On most plantations, however, a room in the main house was sufficient for schooling, rather than a separate dedicated <b>building.</b> <b>Paper</b> was precious, so the children often recited their lessons until they memorized them. The usual texts in the beginning were the Bible, a primer, and a hornbook. As the children grew older their schooling began to prepare them for their adult roles on the plantation. Boys studied academic subjects, proper social etiquette, and plantation management, while girls learned art, music, French, and the domestic skills suited to the mistress of a plantation.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{physical}} {{problem is}} water infiltrating into the exterior building envelope (walls and roofs) of buildings, usually through a weather barrier (e.g. <b>building</b> <b>paper</b> or air barrier membrane) {{that is designed}} to prevent water drops to pass through, but allow water vapour through. However, problems in design, installation, and damage during construction can allow water to penetrate the walls. This causes rot and delamination of exterior wall cladding and sheathing, rusting in metal wall studs, rot in the wood structure, saturation of batt insulation, and development of mould and spores inside the walls and building interior. The construction failures ranged from minor to major failure of the structural integrity of the building. Some buildings became unhealthy to occupants. Most of these buildings are low-rise, 3-4 story buildings constructed of wood-frame construction, as well as some with steel, concrete, and metal stud construction types, including highrises.|$|E

Johnston made a profound influence not only on Hewitt's photographic career but also on her personal life for several years. She then became a fan of Johnston and started writing letters to her seeking her help professionally and personally. Hewitt sought her advice on several matters including providing a job opportunity for her husband with Lumière, the French photographers and scientists, in his newly opened East Coast office in New York. She sought Johnston's advice for creating a dark room in her house, which however was built by her husband; this dark room made with walls fixed with terracotta <b>building</b> <b>paper</b> had enough shelves and space for two people to work freely.

But {{it is difficult to}} check students ’ ability of E-business application operation. In this paper, we will discuss an intelligent examination system that is for checking the examinee’s ability of E-business application operation. This paper presents the design and implementation of an intelligent examination system for checking the E-business application operation capable of the examinees. It proposes a novel architecture for on-line examination system which is based on E-business workflow.
