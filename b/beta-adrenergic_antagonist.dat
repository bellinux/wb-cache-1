40|$|Memory {{enhancement}} {{for emotional}} events {{is dependent on}} amygdala activation and noradrenergic modulation during learning. A potential role for noradrenaline (NE) during retrieval of emotional memory is less well understood. Here, we report that administration of the <b>beta-adrenergic</b> receptor <b>antagonist</b> propranolol at retrieval abolishes a declarative memory enhancement for emotional items. Critically, this effect persists at a subsequent 24 h memory test, {{in the absence of}} propranolol. Thus, these findings extend our current understanding of the role of NE in emotional memory to encompass effects at retrieval, and provide face validity to clinical interventions using <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>antagonists</b> in conjunction with reactivation of unwanted memories in anxiety-related disorders...|$|R

30|$|Research {{from both}} the human and animal literatures {{converge}} {{in support of the}} notion that stress hormones play a role in solidifying memory of material learned just prior to the arousal induction. For example, when rats were administered stress hormones after a training phase, they subsequently exhibited enhanced memory for their training; however, when the stress hormones were blocked by <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>antagonists,</b> their behavior indicated impaired memory compared to counterparts who received stress hormones without <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>antagonists</b> (Liang, Juler, & McGaugh, 1986). In another study, rats who had access to a running wheel immediately after extinction training (following fear conditioning) exhibited lower freezing behavior when re-exposed to the fear-conditioned context (Siette, Reichelt, & Westbrook, 2014). Similarly, when human participants were intravenously administered doses of epinephrine immediately after viewing a series of pictures, they freely recalled more items a week later than did those participants who were injected with saline instead (Cahill & Alkire, 2003). Because the administration of stress hormones occurred after learning, their impact could not be attributed to changes in motivation, emotion, or attention during encoding. Notably, the impact of stress hormones on memory consolidation is not uniform across all individuals: a growing number of studies have documented sex differences in the modulatory impact of stress on memory (e.g., Andreano, Arjomandi, & Cahill, 2008; Andreano & Cahill, 2006; Felmingham, Fong, & Bryant, 2012; Jackson et al., 2005; Nielsen, Segal, Worden, Yim, & Cahill, 2013; Wolf et al, 2001).|$|R

40|$|Minus) [3 -H] alprenolol, {{a potent}} <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>antagonist,</b> {{was used to}} {{identify}} binding sites in a fraction of canine cyocardium. Beta adrenergic agonists and antagonists compete for these binding sites in a manner which directly parallels their known affinity for the cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor. Thus, binding was highly stereo-specific, with the (minus) isomers of beta-adrenergic agonists or antagonists being at least two orders of magnitude more potent than were the (plus) isomers in competing for these sites. The order of potency for inhibition of binding by beta-adrenergic agonists was (minus) isoproterenol greater than (minus) epinephrine greater than (minus) norepinephrine. The dissociation constant (KD) of (minus) alprenolol for the beta-adrenergic receptors was 7 - 11 nM as determined independently by direct binding studies or by inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4. 6. 1. 1]. The <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>antagonist</b> (minus) propranolol also had high affinity for the binding sites (KD equals 12 nM). The physiologically inactive catechol-containing compounds pyrocatechol and (plus or minus) dihydroxymandelic acid, {{as well as the}} metabolite (plus or minus) normetanephrine, and the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine did not compete for the binding sites at a concentration of 160 muM. Binding was rapid (t 1 / 2 less than 30 sec) and was rapidly reversible (t 1 / 2 less than 15 sec). The binding sites were saturable and bound 0. 35 pmol of (minus) [3 -H] alprenolol per mg of membrane protein.

40|$|In {{patients}} with essential hypertension, glucose intoleranceand/or hyperinsulinaemia are common findings. The con-cept that insulin resistance {{is associated with}} essential hyper-tension is well established.

Although the number of circulating NK cells did not change, NK-cell activity was reduced markedly after propranolol treatment.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} leptin inhibits bone formation by an undefined mechanism. Here, {{we show that}} hypothalamic leptin-dependent antiosteogenic and anorexigenic networks differ, and that the peripheral mediators of leptin antiosteogenic function appear to be neuronal. Neuropeptides mediating leptin anorexigenic function do not affect bone formation. Leptin deficiency results in low sympathetic tone, and genetic or pharmacological ablation of adrenergic signaling leads to a leptin-resistant high bone mass. beta-adrenergic receptors on osteoblasts regulate their proliferation, and a beta-adrenergic agonist decreases bone mass in leptin-deficient and wild-type mice while a <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>antagonist</b> increases bone mass in wild-type and ovariectomized mice. None of these manipulations affects body weight. This study demonstrates a leptin-dependent neuronal regulation of bone formation with potential therapeutic implications for osteoporosis...|$|E

40|$|The {{aromatization}} {{of testosterone}} {{has been studied}} in Sertoli cell-enriched cultures derived from 19 -day-old rats.

At a concentration of 10 (- 5) M, the strongest effects were noted with L-isoproterenol, L-norepinephrine, L-epinephrine and D,L-synephrine. Some stimulation was observed with dopamine, whereas histamine, melatonin and serotonin as well as acetylcholine and pilocarpine were ineffective. Experiments with alpha- and <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>antagonists</b> suggest that beta 2 - and maybe also alpha-receptors are involved.
