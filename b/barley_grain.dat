2500|$|Malt extract is {{frequently}} {{used in the}} brewing of beer. Its production begins by germinating <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> in {{a process known as}} malting, [...] immersing barley in water to encourage the grain to sprout, then drying the barley to halt the progress when the sprouting begins. The drying step stops the sprouting, but the enzymes remain active due to the low temperatures used in base malt production. In one before-and-after comparison, malting decreased barley's extractable starch content by about 7% on a dry matter basis, and turned that portion into various other carbohydrates.|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>barley</b> <b>grains</b> as bioreactors for {{high-level}} {{production of}} cellulase (1, 4 -b-glucanase) was investigated. A hybrid cellulase gene, cel-hyb 1, {{driven by the}} rice GluB- 1 promoter was expressed specifically in developing endosperm. Codon usage optimisation of celhyb 1 increased its expression in <b>barley</b> <b>grains</b> 527 -fold and led to cellulase production of up to 1. 5 % of total grain protein. CEL-HYB 1 enzyme in <b>barley</b> <b>grains</b> was highly stable during post-harvest storage. Selectable marker gene (hph) was subsequently eliminated from transgenic lines through segregation of hph from synthetic cel-hyb 1 (syn. cel-hyb 1) in T 1 progeny, using a binary plasmid containing hph and syn. cel-hyb 1 in separate T-DNAs. These data suggest that <b>barley</b> <b>grains</b> can potentially {{be used for the}} commercial production of cellulase...|$|R
40|$|The {{germination}} of <b>barley</b> <b>grains</b> is {{an important}} step in malt production for beer brewing. This study examines the changes in starch molecular structure in <b>barley</b> <b>grains</b> under optimal conditions for sprouting. Two barley varieties were tested: Schooner and Grimmett, which are low and moderate dormancy grains, with > 90 and 0. 05). The starch chain-length distributions, analyzed from enzymatically debranched starch molecules with size-exclusion chromatography, indicated that the shorter amylopectin branches of Schooner were degraded at a faster rate than its longer amylopectin branches, which was also confirmed by the decreasing degree of branching with germination time. The changes in starch molecular structure of Grimmett grains were less apparent. The results of this study showed that <b>barley</b> <b>grains</b> containing shorter starch chains can produce sugars more quickly, which indicates that starch structure can serve as one of the specifications when selecting <b>barley</b> <b>grains</b> for brewing...|$|R

40|$|In the {{bacterial}} processes {{involved in}} the mitigation of nitrogen pollution, an adequately high carbon-to-nitrogen (C[*]:[*]N) ratio is key to sustain denitrification. We evaluated three natural materials (woodchips, <b>barley</b> <b>grains,</b> and peanut shells) as carbon sources for low C[*]:[*]N wastewater. The amount of organic matter released from these materials to aqueous media was evaluated, {{as well as their}} pollution swapping potential by measuring the release of total Kjeldahl nitrogen, N-NH 4 +, NO 2 -, and NO 3 -, and total phosphorous. <b>Barley</b> <b>grains</b> yielded the highest amount of organic matter, which also showed to be the most easily biodegradable. Woodchips and peanut shells released carbon rather steadily and so they would not require frequent replenishment from biological reactors. These materials produced eluates with lower concentrations of nutrients than the leachates from <b>barley</b> <b>grains.</b> However, as woodchips yielded lower amounts of suspended solids, they constitute an adequate exogenous source for the biological treatment of carbon-deficient effluents...|$|R
