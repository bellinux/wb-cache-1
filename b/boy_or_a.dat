Perin is a very nice person, as she asked if Mia was alright after Michael announces he is moving to Japan, and, though shocked by Mia's new haircut in book eight, says nothing about it. She is also {{surprisingly}} strong and well-mannered.

It was completely counter to the shellacked, flashy aesthetic of the 1980s in every way.

For Douglas the sexological view of homosexuality was pseudoscience, incompatible with the Christian doctrine of free will; instead, he argued, homosexuals were damned by their own choice– which meant that others could be corrupted by [...] "their propaganda". Above all, children must be protected: [...] "I would rather give a healthy <b>boy</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> healthy girl a phial of prussic acid than this novel.

2500|$|In Greek myths, {{dolphins}} {{were seen}} invariably as helpers of humankind. Dolphins {{also seem to}} have been important to the Minoans, judging by artistic evidence from the ruined palace at Knossos. During the 2009 excavations of a major Mycenaean city at Iklaina, a striking fragment of a wall-paintings came to light, depicting a ship with three human figures and dolphins. Dolphins are common in Greek mythology, and many coins from ancient Greece have been found which feature a man, a <b>boy</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> deity riding {{on the back of a}} dolphin. The Ancient Greeks welcomed dolphins; spotting dolphins riding in a ship's wake was considered a good omen. [...] In both ancient and later art, Cupid is often shown riding a dolphin. A dolphin rescued the poet Arion from drowning and carried him safe to land, at Cape Matapan, a promontory forming the southernmost point of the Peloponnesus. There was a temple to Poseidon and a statue of Arion riding the dolphin.|$|E

I learned to do lots of things, but some of the things aren't of much use to me now - for example, how to put a six- or eight-horse team around a sharp bend. But some are real useful.

A boy may become a novice on more than one occasion, but by the age of twenty there will be another great occasion, the upasampada ordination, in which the boy becomes a fully ordained bhikkhu ( [...] bazin).

2500|$|Scharnhorst {{writes that}} Alger [...] "exercised a certain {{discretion}} in discussing his probable homosexuality" [...] and {{was known to}} have mentioned his sexuality only once after the Brewster incident. In 1870 the elder Henry James wrote that Alger [...] "talks freely about his own late insanity—which he in fact appears to enjoy as a subject of conversation". Although Alger was willing to speak to James, his sexuality was a closely guarded secret. According to Scharnhorst, Alger made veiled references to homosexuality in his boys' books, and these references, Scharnhorst speculates, indicate Alger was [...] "insecure with his sexual orientation". Alger wrote, for example, {{that it was difficult}} to distinguish whether Tattered Tom was a <b>boy</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> girl and in other instances he introduces foppish, effeminate, lisping [...] "stereotypical homosexuals" [...] who are treated with scorn and pity by others. In Silas Snobden's Office Boy, a kidnapped boy disguised as a girl is threatened with being sent to the [...] "insane asylum" [...] if he should reveal his actual sex. Scharnhorst believes Alger's desire to atone for his [...] "secret sin" [...] may have [...] "spurred him to identify his own charitable acts of writing didactic books for boys with the acts of the charitable patrons in his books who wish to atone for a secret sin in their past by aiding the hero". Scharnhorst points out that the patron in Try and Trust, for example, conceals a [...] "sad secret" [...] from which he is redeemed only after saving the hero's life.|$|E
