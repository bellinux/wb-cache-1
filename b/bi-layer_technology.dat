40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{development}} of the WENDELSTEIN 7 -X divertor is the manufacturing of approximately 900 plasma facing components (PFCs) that meet all requirements for reliable long pulse and long-term plasma operation. The actively cooled PFCs are made of CFC NB 31 as plasma facing material bonded by Active Metal Casting Â® (AMC) copper interlayer onto CuCrZr cooling structure. The pre-series activities integrated extensive high heat flux (HHF) testing to assess the industrial manufacturing. Tests were performed in the GLADIS facility under load conditions similar to those expected during operation of W 7 -X. The investigations focused on the improvement of fatigue resistance of the CFC/Cu bonding. The results of the last HHF test campaign demonstrated a significant enhancement of the CFC bonding quality due to the introduction of the AMC/Cu <b>bi-layer</b> <b>technology.</b> The results of the micro-chemical analyses (using EDX, AES, XPS and SIMS) of the CFC/Cu interface performed after 5000 cycles at 10 MW/m confirmed its chemical stability. Far beyond the current available data about the expected lifetime of CFC-armoured PFCs, 10, 000 cycles at 10 MW/m were applied without any damages at the interface. The present design and manufacturing process of the tested PFCs fulfil all requirements for W 7 -X operation...|$|E

Bi-layer tablet is a new era in the development of controlled release formulation along with various features to provide a way of successful drug delivery system. It is suitable to prepare the tablets in the form of multi layers which are used for the administration of two drugs which are chemically incompatible. Several pharmaceutical companies are currently developing bi-layered tablets, {{for a variety of reasons}} such as patent extension, patient compliance, additive effect, reduction of dosage regimen and to achieve sustained release of drugs with minimal side effects. Apart from the advantages it has many so many disadvantages and problems too. An attempt has been made in this review article to introduce the readers to the various aspects of <b>bi-layered</b> tablet <b>technology</b> and various applications in current research...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Bi-layer</b> tablet <b>technology</b> for bimodal {{release of}} drug and co-administration of drugs via oral route has been engaged a {{significant}} {{place in the}} field of drug delivery technology. At present, several pharmaceutical companies are developing bilayer tablet for co-administration of drugs to improve the therapeutic efficacy as well as to reduce the chances of drug-drug interaction. This review indicates the different aspects of drug release mechanism, different strategies of drug release, various techniques for bilayer tablet, and the influence of different process and formulation parameters must be considered during the development of bilayer tablet. Bi-layer tablet is suitable for sequential release of two drugs in combination, separate two incompatible substances, and also for sustained release tablet in which one layer is immediate release as initial dose and second layer is maintenance dose...|$|R
