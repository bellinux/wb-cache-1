Eight of the main perennial rivers of La Réunion Island (Mascarene Islands) were sampled in 2000, in order to describe their population genetic structure. A total of 267 adult specimens of S. lagocephalus were screened for 14 enzymatic systems providing 15 presumptive loci, 11 of them being polymorphic. Four other loci were useful as diagnostic markers between S. lagocephalus and Cotylopus acutipinnis, a similar, closely related sympatric species. Both species constitute an economic resource locally called “bichique”. The focus of this study, S. lagocephalus, accounts {{for the majority of the}} <b>bichique.</b> The results clearly showed a genetic homogeneity among the eight samples (Fst tests). Within-samples tests (Fis) indicated, in general, a heterozygote deficiency. The multidimensional diagrams (CA) describe an overall structure composed of two main subgroups. This structure was not confirmed in a 2001 sampling. The interpretation of the results takes into account the biological life cycle of this species, characterized by a planktonic phase, from hatching to recruitment, followed by a freshwater life of the adults. All the samples in the survey belong to a single pool. However, the young fish entering the rivers are probably of complex origin. We did not find any isolation between rivers and this result should be considered when conservation measures are taken to prevent overfishing...|$|E

They are {{extremely}} voracious fishes and have been observed to swallow fishes almost their size! The adults are found mostly near estuaries while the younger fish prefer the lower course of rivers. Seldom active, they lie in wait to pounce on an unsuspecting prey. Gobies go to lay their eggs in the sea, and the larvae swim upstream around December. Locally known as <b>bichiques,</b> they are caught and eaten as a delicacy by the local population. But their numbers seem to have considerably dwindled. (There is another theory that gobies do not go to the sea but that their eggs are swept into the ocean by water currents; the larvae swim upstream in great numbers during the new moon.) ...|$|R
