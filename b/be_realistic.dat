5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted {{as representative of}} religion and religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, necessary for {{a better understanding of}} theism. Marxists and anarchists also felt that their ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters were meant to <b>be</b> <b>realistic,</b> and that few people have as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{painting}} met with mixed reactions from art critics and historians. Artists had previously tended to depict {{war in the}} high style of history painting, and Goya's unheroic description was unusual for the time. According to some early critical opinion the painting was flawed technically: the perspective is flat, or the victims and executioners are standing too close together to <b>be</b> <b>realistic.</b> Although these observations may be strictly correct, the writer Richard Schickel argues that Goya was not striving for academic propriety but rather to strengthen the overall impact of the piece.|$|E
5|$|Cast members {{observed}} {{the staff at}} real hospitals in preparation for their roles. Stephenson and Griffin spent time at Watford Hospital, where they underwent {{a crash course in}} nursing basics, including handling bed pans and learning to make beds with hospital corners. Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital, while French shadowed a consultant and registrar at Papworth Hospital, observing a heart bypass and lung biopsy procedure. Young explained that viewers believe in Casualty and trust the show to <b>be</b> <b>realistic,</b> and that he wanted Holby City to be the same in that regard.|$|E

5|$|Despite Mihardja's {{insistence that}} Atheis {{is meant to}} <b>be</b> <b>realistic,</b> several {{symbolic}} interpretations have been put forward. According to Mihardja, {{one of the most}} common interpretations readers conveyed to him was that Hasan's death symbolised atheism defeating religion, with Hasan's death as the death of theism. According to Maier, Atheis serves as an allegory for the development of the Indonesian nation. Hasan, representing traditionalism, is killed by the Japanese, who changed the status quo when they invaded in 1942. Meanwhile, the anarchistic Anwar finds himself without a place in the modern world. Only the responsible modern character, Rusli, is able to bring the Indonesian nation, as represented by Kartini, to terms with the new world.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts six {{to seven}} months. Births {{generally}} occur in the midday; the female will isolate herself from the herd when labour pain begins. The perception that females can delay giving birth for an additional month if conditions are harsh may however not <b>be</b> <b>realistic.</b> A single calf is born, and is immediately concealed in cover {{for the first few}} weeks of its birth. The fawn then joins a nursery group within its mother's herd. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males, forced out of the group, join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E
5|$|Mihardja, a journalist-cum-literary {{editor who}} {{associated}} with the eccentric poet Chairil Anwar and the Socialist Party of Indonesia, wrote Atheis from May 1948 to February 1949. The Indonesian used in the novel was influenced by Sundanese and harkens back to earlier works by Minang writers, as opposed to Mihardja's contemporaries who attempted {{to distance themselves from}} the earlier style. Dealing mainly with faith, the novel also touches on the interactions between modernity and traditionalism. Although the writer insisted that the work was meant to <b>be</b> <b>realistic,</b> symbolic representations from subjective meanings to the novel being an allegory have been advanced.|$|E

5|$|Strong {{reveals that}} the {{procession}} {{was connected to the}} marriage of Henry Somerset, Lord Herbert, and Lady Anne Russell, one of the queen’s six maids of honour, on 16 June 1600. He identifies many of the individuals portrayed in the procession and shows that instead of a litter, as was previously assumed, Queen Elizabeth is sitting on a wheeled cart or chariot. Strong also suggests that the landscape and castles in the background are not intended to <b>be</b> <b>realistic.</b> In accordance with Elizabethan stylistic conventions, they are emblematic, here representing the Welsh properties of Edward Somerset, Earl of Worcester, to which his son Lord Herbert was the heir. The earl may have commissioned the picture to celebrate his appointment as Master of the Queen’s Horse in 1601.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Driving Emotion Type-S follows general {{conventions of}} racing games. The game's physics and controls intend to <b>be</b> <b>realistic</b> and {{are based on}} vehicular weight. The player competes in races with other computer-controlled cars in order to unlock new cars and tracks. Car settings can be customized, {{as well as their}} colors, before each course. The game includes 43 officially licensed cars from thirteen Japanese and European manufacturers, including BMW, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, Porsche, Subaru, Mitsubishi, TVR, Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, JGTC, and Lexus which was exclusive to the Western versions of the game. Fourteen courses are available in total, including two fictional circuit and real circuit like The Home of Formula One Circuit in Japan Suzuka Circuit and the home of Super Lap in Japan Tsukuba Circuit, and one exclusive to the Western versions of the game called West Coast.|$|E
5|$|For {{his work}} as art director, Yoshida needed to adjust from working on a single static project to {{creating}} artwork assets for a game which would be updated and expanded. While the game world was created around a high fantasy aesthetic, {{it was meant to}} <b>be</b> <b>realistic</b> and encourage exploration. At the beginning of development, the team created a detailed profile of Hydaelyn, including its relation with other planets, ecosystems, climate, and geography. This was done to promote a sense of realism. Alongside creating a seamless travel experience for players, careful work was put into the topography and varied lighting of environments so they would not seem repetitive. After the environment was created, the architectural, cultural and religious elements of the world were incorporated into the environment. City and machine designs mixed metallic and natural materials to create a combined sense of wonder and familiarity for players. The game's five playable races were directly based on the five initial races from Final Fantasy XI, with design adjustments to reflect the new setting. The developers also created two different tribes, as opposed to the single tribe set-up present in XI. Characters' movements were primarily developed using motion capture, though the recorded movements were then adjusted so they would be sharp and distinctive. Much work was invested in creating emotes, character movements chosen by the player to represent a specific mood or emotion previously used in XI. To create realistic expressions, a character artist manually adjusted the faces for each expression. For the monsters, advances in hardware enabled the team to create more realistic and detailed character models, including detailed skin textures and carefully placed hair follicles.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the boy is}} less {{detailed}} than Trico, he {{was also}} animated via key frame animation. He places hands on nearby walls, and reaches to pet Trico without player interaction. Ueda felt these animations were necessary to help convince the player of the game world. The animation system uses layers of animation that mimic real-life physics, {{taking advantage of the}} greater processing power of the PlayStation 4. The team considered making the player character a girl, but felt it would not <b>be</b> <b>realistic</b> that a female character would have enough stamina to climb Trico.|$|E
25|$|Paints {{were made}} from animal, {{vegetable}} and mineral pigments and bases. Most paintings focus one or more human figures, which may <b>be</b> <b>realistic</b> or stylized, masculine, feminine or asexual. They may be naked or richly attired, but the social status of each figure is indicated in some way. Scenes often depict war, sacrifice, {{the roles of the}} gods or the acts of nobles. However, some common scenes with common people have been found as well. Other subjects included gods, symbols and animals. Mesoamerican painting was bi-dimensional with no efforts to create the illusion of depth. However, movement is often represented.|$|E

25|$|After the war, {{although}} Cliff was occasionally {{nostalgic for}} the 'Bizarre' years, as witnessed in personal letters to friends, {{she seemed to}} <b>be</b> <b>realistic</b> and accepted the commercial taste was for conservative ware. Clarice seemed to enjoy playing a lesser role at the factory, knowing {{that she could not}} recapture those crazy days of the thirties. Much of the post-war production went to Australia, New Zealand or North America, where the taste was for formal ware in traditional English designs such as Tonquin rather than the striking patterns and shapes that had established Cliff's reputation; thus she was never to return to creative work. The post-war ware has little value at auction.|$|E
25|$|Although not capped, Newham was {{severely}} affected by grant penalties. It {{had worked with}} the capped councils and decided to join the campaign: on 7 March the council members unanimously passed a motion declaring {{that they could not}} set a rate. Council deputy leader Alan Mattingly said that the majority of councillors would go to jail rather than cut services. It was soon clear that there was a significant split in the Labour group as Leader Jack Hart told a council meeting on 28 March that the Government would not increase their spending limit and urged members to <b>be</b> <b>realistic.</b> His ally, councillor David Gilles, proposed a budget of £151.5m. Alan Mattingly by contrast urged the council to stand firm and despite Hart's support the budget was defeated by 18 to 35; a budget proposed by the SDP was voted down by 20 to 33.|$|E
25|$|Mehmet Osman was conceptualised by {{the creators}} of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Mehmet, the brother of {{original}} character Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), {{was part of a}} well-intentioned attempt to represent the proportion of Turkish Cypriots who had immigrated to England and settled in the East End of London. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with. Additionally, if the programme was to <b>be</b> <b>realistic,</b> it had to reflect the cross-section of society that actually existed in the real location. For these reasons, different sexes, ages, classes, religions and races were all included in the original character line-up. Both Holland and Smith had {{been at the forefront of}} the move towards 'integrated casting' in television and had encountered an array of ethnic diversities in the process. Even though the ethnic minority groups were deemed the hardest to research, Holland and Smith called upon their social contacts to relay information about their own origins and lifestyles, which they say allowed them to portray Walford's most recent immigrants more realistically.|$|E

25|$|In April of {{his seventh}} year, Amenhotep {{was faced with}} a major {{rebellion}} in Syria by the vassal states of Naharin and dispatched his army to the Levant to suppress it. This rebellion was likely instigated by Egypt's chief Near Eastern rival, Mitanni. His stele of victory carved after this campaign records no major battles, which has been read a number of ways. It may be that this campaign was more similar to one of the tours of Syria which his father had fought, and he only engaged minor garrisons in battle and forced cities to swear allegiance to himoaths immediately broken after his departure. Alternatively, it appears that the two weeks when Amenhotep would have been closest to Mitanni are omitted from the stele, thus it is possible that his army was defeated on this campaign. Amenhotep's last campaign took place in his ninth year, however it apparently did not proceed farther north than the Sea of Galilee. According to the list of plunder from this campaign, Amenhotep took 101,128 slaves, which is an obviously exaggerated figure. Some of these slaves may have been recounted from the year 7 campaign, such as 15,070 citizens of Nukhash, since Amenhotep did not campaign anywhere near Nukhash on his year 9 campaign. However, even accounting for this recounting, the numbers still are too high to <b>be</b> <b>realistic,</b> and are probably just exaggerated.|$|E
25|$|The {{absence of}} {{mosquitoes}} from Iceland and similar regions is {{probably because of}} quirks of their climate, which differs in some respects from mainland regions. At {{the start of the}} uninterrupted continental winter of Greenland and the northern regions of Eurasia and America, the pupa enters diapause under the ice that covers sufficiently deep water. The imago ecloses only after the ice breaks in late spring. In Iceland however, the weather is less predictable. In mid-winter it frequently warms up suddenly, causing the ice to break, but then to freeze again after a few days. By that time the mosquitoes will have emerged from their pupae, but the new freeze sets in before they can complete their life cycle. Any anautogenous adult mosquito would need a host to supply a blood meal before it could lay viable eggs; it would need time to mate, mature the eggs and oviposit in suitable wetlands. These requirements would not <b>be</b> <b>realistic</b> in Iceland and in fact the absence of mosquitoes from such subpolar islands is in line with the islands' low biodiversity; Iceland has fewer than 1,500 described species of insects, many of them probably accidentally introduced by human agency. In Iceland most ectoparasitic insects live in sheltered conditions or actually on mammals; examples include lice, fleas and bedbugs, in whose living conditions freezing is no concern, and most of which were introduced inadvertently by humans.|$|E
