40|$|We have {{extended}} {{the analysis of}} the near infrared absorption spectrum of ozone up to 7920 cm− 1 i. e. only 7 % below the dissociation energy, D 0. The spectra of 16 O 3 and 18 O 3 and of two 18 O enriched samples were recorded at LIPhy-Grenoble by high-sensitivity Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy between 5850 and 7920 cm− 1. In this presentation, we will update the recent review of Refs 1, 2 by new analysis for the different isotopologues, in particular the three most excited bands of 16 O 3 reported so far. These results are of particular interest to test and validate the potential energy surface in its ground electronic state with potential impact on non-LTE studies. Overall, a total of 71 bands were rovibrationally assigned and modelled: 29 <b>bands</b> <b>for</b> 666 (9024 assigned transitions) 7 <b>bands</b> <b>for</b> 668 (3117) 4 <b>bands</b> <b>for</b> 686 (1308) 3 <b>bands</b> <b>for</b> 886 (1849) 6 <b>bands</b> <b>for</b> 868 (1914) 22 <b>bands</b> <b>for</b> 888 (6332) Total : 23544, leading to the knowledge of 13412 energy levels. The effective Hamiltonian modelling also includes 69 dark bands in interaction with the observed bright bands. We will illustrate the achieved agreements between observed and calculated spectra. Comparisons between fitted and predicted band centres and rotational constants will be discussed...|$|R

5|$|Following an {{avalanche}} at San Carlos Minas in January 1992, Hermética joined a charity music festival {{held at the}} Chateau Carreras stadium. Hermética played only a few songs at a concert with Riffthe headline band, which ended with minor riots. Hermética were the opening act for Black Sabbath at Obras Sanitarias; Black Sabbath's frontman Ronnie James Dio thanked the <b>band</b> <b>for</b> playing with them. The band leased 25% of the copyright of their songs to Daniel Grinbank, the businessman who brought rock bands to Argentina to play with Black Sabbath. In October 1992, they were the supporting <b>band</b> <b>for</b> Motörhead in Obras. They were offered a concert in Paraguay, but once in the country the show's producers tried to pay less money than had been agreed. Unable to find an alternative location, the band refused to play and returned to Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Alive or Just Breathing, Leach left the <b>band</b> <b>for</b> {{personal}} and health issues. Killswitch Engage quickly recruited Howard Jones to replace Leach. Jones would stay in the <b>band</b> <b>for</b> nearly ten years, until his departure in 2012, which prompted Leach to rejoin the band on the ten-year anniversary of Alive or Just Breathing. This is also the last album to feature Dutkiewicz on drums, as he would switch to guitar before the touring process. The drumming position was filled by Tom Gomes.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, with many commending the <b>band</b> <b>for</b> making {{music with a}} darker tone. However, the album was criticized for lacking a stand-out lead single. Commercially, the album was not as successful as Flood (1990), peaking at number 99 on the Billboard 200 and spending only six weeks on that chart. In addition, some fans were upset that and Flansburgh and Linnell opted to use a backing <b>band</b> <b>for</b> the album's tour, with some even boycotting shows.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, the band's web site removed Rudd as the band's drummer and replaced him with Slade.

5|$|Both Frank Black and Teenager of the Year were {{critically}} well received, {{although they}} enjoyed limited commercial success. In 1995, Thompson left his long-time labels 4AD and Elektra. In 1996, he released The Cult of Ray on Rick Rubin's American Recordings; the album marked a {{turn away from}} the elaborate production of his first solo works and was recorded primarily live with few overdubs. His <b>band</b> <b>for</b> this album featured sole Teenager holdover Lyle Workman on lead guitar, along with bassist David McCaffrey and Scott Boutier on drums. Though the album was neither critically nor commercially successful, its stripped-down approach would increasingly define Thompson's working methods for the next several years.|$|E
5|$|Daybreaker {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Some reviewers praised the <b>band</b> <b>for</b> texturing and progressing their sound, and for writing socio-political lyrics. The album was criticised for sounding forced or formulaic.

The molecular weight of the d-Hyd is around 52  kDa, while the d-Hyd(co) has a molecular weight of around 56  kDa.

Additionally, the intensities of <b>bands</b> <b>for</b> insoluble hydantoinase decrease together with rotation speeds for the cultured bacteria. Figure  3 b, image of the corresponding samples from crude cell extracts, shows an identical pattern with stained proteins about the entire molecular weight range for both recombinant hydantoinase cultures with every rotation speed for the cultured bacteria.
