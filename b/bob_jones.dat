5|$|The {{character}} {{has said he}} was regularly beaten up in high school, {{and by the time}} he left for college he was determined never to be a victim again. As such, on the first day of his freshman year he walked into class and punched the first person he saw (unfortunately, this happened to be his ethics professor). He attended Dartmouth College (instead of his first pick, Hogwarts, claiming that his white owl led them to reject him), and was a member of the ΣΑΕ fraternity, although his acceptance into the college appears to have been largely influenced by a claimed familial relationship with a wealthy donor, and graduated in the top 47 percent of his class with a major in history. He has also referred to <b>Bob</b> <b>Jones</b> University as an alma mater.|$|E

The Greenville–Spartanburg International Airport was established in nearby Greer in 1962. The economy of Greenville finally waned in the 1970s leaving a void in downtown Greenville due to the flight of many retailers.

25|$|Muldoon's {{third term}} was tumultuous. With a one-seat {{majority}} he faced an increasingly restless backbench {{who wanted the}} National Party to adopt a more economically liberal stance. Early in 1982 Derek Quigley, a junior minister who had been demoted {{for his role in}} the Colonel's Coup of 1980, spoke out against Think Big, casting doubts on its benefits. As a result, Muldoon asked him to apologise or resign from Cabinet, Quigley chose to resign. Muldoon had also fallen out with former supporter and millionaire businessman <b>Bob</b> <b>Jones,</b> who made good on a threat to create his own party in protest at Muldoon's economic policies. In 1983 the New Zealand Party was formed by Jones and took a significant share of the vote at the 1984 election.|$|E

Now the AT Pebble Beach Pro-Am, it has been a leading event in the world of professional golf.|$|E
