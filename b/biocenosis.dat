Intestinal microbiocenosis is a component of regulation of proteins and lipids metabolism, vitamins synthesis, detoxication process in intestine, etc. prebiotics include a number of disaccharides (lactulose), oligosaccharides and polysaccharides (inulin, cellulose, etc.). Fructose polymer — inulin — provides growth of bifido- and lactobacteria, improves metabolism and has immunomodulating activity. Formation of intestinal micro <b>biocenosis</b> in infant is provided by prebiotics of breast milk. Further state of micro <b>biocenosis,</b> which is necessary for growth and development of child, is determined by adequate intake of prebiotics from fruits, vegetables and cereals.

In this case, qualifying the environment in practice means thatboth the quantitative and qualitative composition of the <b>biocenosis,</b> and also the factorsresponsible for their distribution in space and time are considered and evaluated ascharacteristics.

40|$|Abstract: Reactors with fixed <b>biocenosis</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} applied for fish farm recirculating water treatment, {{as they have}} a number of advantages over other biological purification plants. In actual practice, inefficient plants which generally operate in a single-stage mode are often used. Finer treatment of fish farm recirculating water with removal of organic and nitrogen-containing contaminants can be achieved by a multi-stage biological process. Comparative studies of multi-stage treatment of fish farm recirculating water by reactors with fixed <b>biocenosis</b> were conducted in order to choose the optimal process flow scheme. The study results determine optimal process flow schemes for fish farm recirculating water treatment in such bioreactors as well as parameters for their operation in the course of bio-oxydation of organic contaminants and ammonium salts and denitrification. The best results were achieved when applying three-stage biological treatment of fish farm recirculating water where the oxidizer is configured as a percolating filter and the nitrification filter and the denitrification filter are accomplished in the form of flooded bioreactors. Besides, the oxidizer and the nitrification filter are placed successively in the main water flux to be treated whereas the denitrification filter is installed in a separate zone. The obtained results allow to define reactor volumes for carrying out of nitrification and denitrification in the course of fish farm recirculating water treatment.

40|$|Reject water, {{produced}} during stabilization and dewatering of activated sludge, contains a high load of biogenic compounds which are returned to bioreactors, {{so there is}} a necessity for its treatment within biological systems. The efficacy of such performance depends mainly on the activated sludge composition responsible for the biochemical processes.

In this article we monitored the activated sludge bacterial communities of two sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) dealing with reject water but varying in their operational parameters.
