5|$|Public {{condemnation}} {{of the use of}} <b>breaker</b> boys was so widespread that in 1885 Pennsylvania enacted a law forbidding the employment of anyone under the age of 12 from working in a coal <b>breaker,</b> but the law was poorly enforced; many employers forged proof-of-age documentation, and many families forged birth certificates or other documents so their children could support the family. Estimates of the number of <b>breaker</b> boys at work in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania vary widely, and official statistics are generally considered by historians to undercount the numbers significantly. One estimate had 20,000 <b>breaker</b> boys working in the state in 1880, 18,000 working in 1900, 13,133 working in 1902, and 24,000 working in 1907. Technological innovations in the 1890s and 1900s (such as mechanical and water separators designed to remove impurities from coal) dramatically lowered the need for <b>breaker</b> boys, but adoption of the new technology was slow.|$|E
5|$|The work {{performed}} by <b>breaker</b> boys was hazardous. <b>Breaker</b> boys {{were forced to}} work without gloves {{so that they could}} better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and <b>breaker</b> boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. <b>Breaker</b> boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only {{at the end of the}} working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that <b>breaker</b> boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the <b>breaker</b> boys.|$|E

50|$|The name Orlando <b>Breakers</b> was {{a salute}} to the defunct USFL and the Portland <b>Breakers,</b> New Orleans <b>Breakers,</b> and Boston <b>Breakers.</b> The <b>Breakers</b> {{themselves}} were {{a parody of}} the fellow Florida-based Jacksonville Jaguars, who, like the <b>Breakers,</b> joined the NFL in 1995 as an expansion team and made the playoffs their second season as a wild card team and, like the <b>Breakers,</b> played the Bills in their first playoff game. (Unlike the <b>Breakers,</b> the Jaguars came out victorious, 30-27, eventually losing to the New England Patriots 20-6 in the AFC Championship Game.) Another tie-in between the <b>Breakers</b> and the Jaguars was that the very first game the latter played in, the 1995 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game (against their expansion brethren the Carolina Panthers), aired on ABC, the same network as Coach.|$|R
5|$|<b>Breaker</b> {{boys were}} {{known for their}} fierce {{independence}} and rejection of adult authority. <b>Breaker</b> boys often formed and joined trade unions, and precipitated {{a number of important}} strikes in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania.

30|$|With the {{development}} of power electronic technologies, solid state circuit <b>breakers</b> based on fully controlled devices [13] have been well researched [14], as well as hybrid DC circuit <b>breakers</b> that combine solid state circuit <b>breakers</b> and traditional mechanical switches. However, both solid state circuit <b>breakers</b> and hybrid DC circuit <b>breakers</b> require devices that are fully controlled. Not only it is expensive, but also the operating complexity is currently far from that required for industrial applications [15].|$|R

25|$|Medium-voltage circuit <b>breakers</b> rated between 1 and 72 kV may be {{assembled}} into metal-enclosed switchgear line ups for indoor use, {{or may be}} individual components installed outdoors in a substation. Air-break circuit <b>breakers</b> replaced oil-filled units for indoor applications, but are now themselves being replaced by vacuum circuit <b>breakers</b> (up to about 40.5 kV). Like the high voltage circuit <b>breakers</b> described below, these are also operated by current sensing protective relays operated through current transformers. The characteristics of MV <b>breakers</b> are given by international standards such as IEC 62271. Medium-voltage circuit <b>breakers</b> nearly always use separate current sensors and protective relays, instead of relying on built-in thermal or magnetic overcurrent sensors.|$|R

5000|$|Vacuum circuit <b>breakers</b> - With {{rated current}} up to 6,300 A, and higher for {{generator}} circuit <b>breakers.</b> These <b>breakers</b> {{interrupt the current}} by creating and extinguishing the arc in a vacuum container - aka [...] "bottle". Long life bellows are designed to travel the 6-10 mm the contacts must part. These are generally applied for voltages up to about 40,500 V, which corresponds roughly to the medium-voltage range of power systems. Vacuum circuit <b>breakers</b> tend to have longer life expectancies between overhaul than do air circuit <b>breakers.</b>|$|R

5|$|By the 1910s, {{the use of}} <b>breaker</b> boys was {{dropping}} because of improvements in technology, stricter child labor laws, and the enactment of compulsory education laws.

In 1994, he portrayed an inexperienced mobster in the crime thriller The Getaway, starring Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, and appeared with Andy García and Meg Ryan in the romantic drama When a Man Loves a Woman.
