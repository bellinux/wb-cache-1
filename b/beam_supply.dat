30|$|In recent times, Droplet Epitaxy (DE) [1, 2] has {{extensively}} {{been used}} for the fabrication of III‚ÄìV semiconductor quantum nanostructures that show a good rotational symmetry. Indeed with this MBE-based technique, many different quantum systems with cylindrical symmetry can be grown, ranging from quantum rings (QRs) [3, 4], to concentric multiple quantum rings (CMQRs) [5], to coupled rings/disks (CRDs) [6]. The interest in fabricating such structures is both fundamental, for the investigation of quantum interference phenomena [7, 8] and practical, {{in the fields of}} optoelectronics [9] and quantum information technology [10]. In GaAs DE, the fabrication of the compound semiconductor is basically achieved in two steps: first, Ga molecular beam is supplied on the substrate in absence of As, for the formation of nanometre-size droplets and then, an As flux is used to transform the droplets into GaAs. Depending on the conditions of the crystallization step, many different shapes of the GaAs nanocrystals can be obtained. In particular, caused by the surface migration of Ga atoms from the originally formed droplet during the As molecular <b>beam</b> <b>supply,</b> a lateral growth of GaAs will be observed, which gives rise to the formation of outer rings or disks. By exploiting this lateral growth, here we propose a fabrication method for the formation of GaAs concentric multiple rings, based on sequential short-time (few tenth of seconds) As molecular beam supplies at different substrate temperatures. Compared to the standard DE, the innovation of our growth protocol consists in supplying only a small amount of As atoms to achieve a partial crystallization of the available Ga, which is stored in the droplets; after changing the substrate temperature, the procedure is repeated.|$|E

We present for the ?first time the MBE growth of GaAs nanostructures on Si substrates by Droplet Epitaxy (DE) [1, 2]. We believe this growth method to be promising {{for the growth of}} high quality GaAs nanoislands directly on Silicon. In the DE, the substrate is irradiated by a Ga molecular beam fl?ux ?first, leading to the formation of numerous fi?ne Ga droplets with uniform size, which are subsequently crystallized into GaAs nanostructures by an As molecular <b>beam</b> <b>supply.</b> By changing the Ga droplets deposition temperature is possible to change independently the size and the density of the droplets, while by varying the As ?flux for the crystallization we can change the fi?nal shape of the GaAs nanocrystals. We present the results for the growth of GaAs on Si by DE where the density of the GaAs nanoislands was changed by two orders of magnitude, while the size is varied from around 200 nm to around 20 nm. Measurements by X-ray microanalysis in the TEM con- fi?rmed the reaction between Ga and As with formation of GaAs.
