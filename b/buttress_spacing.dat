50|$|The {{north and}} south {{elevations}} of the church consist of the transepts with small entrance porches and the nave and 1939 chancel extensions. Entrance is through a pointed arched opening above which is an inverted eyelet window in the transept porches, which have steeply pitched gabled roofs, with smooth faced sandstone coping terminating in carved corbels {{at the base of}} the sides of the gable. The steps on the north have been replaced by a ramp providing access for people with disabilities. Above the porches in the gable of the transepts are circular windows with heavy circular tracery, above which are trefoil window openings. The nave elevations are characterised by bipartite lancet openings, in pointed archways, separated by buttressing. The 1939 extension of the western, entrance end is distinguishable by squared headed window openings and wider <b>buttress</b> <b>spacing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Ellsworth Dam {{is located}} between two bluffs which flank Maine's Union River, and {{rise to a}} height of more than 100 ft. The dam {{consists}} {{of a series of}} <b>buttresses,</b> <b>spaced</b> about 15 ft apart, which provide support for two large slabs of steel-reinforced concrete that span the river between the bluffs. The dam is 71 ft in height, with a spillway 60 ft long. The buttresses, set on a granite bedrock ledge, are three feet thick.|$|R

The foundations and ground floor are constructed of concrete which support load bearing walls of plain red machine-made bricks laid in English bond pattern. Attached <b>buttresses</b> are evenly <b>spaced</b> along the walls on the long axis, and sills, dressings and banding at the first floor and sill levels and are highlighted with dark blue salt glazed bricks. Two sets of new metal fire stairs are located on the eastern side of the building.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} avoid the {{adjacent}} constructions from being damaged in deep excavation project, a certain auxiliary measurement is usually adopted in restraining the ground movements due to excavation so as to protect the adjacent buildings. In recent years, buttress wall has been adopted as an auxiliary measurement in protecting the adjacent buildings in excavation; however, in concerning the way how it performances is still lack of consolidated result of verification. Neither domestic nor foreign is still in lack of regarding the study of mechanism, behavior and analysis methodology of the buttress wall. Thus, until so far, concerning the analysis and designing of buttress wall is still staying in the empirical stage that the configuration of <b>buttress</b> wall, including <b>space,</b> length and depth does not have a consistent agreement. Thus, in some cases there came with relatively large <b>space</b> between the <b>buttress</b> walls; some with longer length; some with depth started from near ground surface downward {{to the bottom of the}} diaphragm wall; some only ended to 1 / 2 depth of the diaphragm wall penetrated to underground; some started from the final excavation downward a certain depth, etc. in various configurations where each revealed different performance separately either in reducing the diaphragm wall displacement effectively or in minor. Therefore, the further study of mechanism, behavior and analysis methodology of buttress wall is required. For this reason, the study shall focus on a series of complete research of buttress wall. As the lateral displacement of diaphragm wall in deep excavation after buttress wall has been set is a 3 -D moving behavior, we decided to apply 3 -D numerical analysis for case studies in simulating the analysis and verification, then studied the various buttress wall models in configuration so as to clarify the mechanism and behavior of diaphragm wall, in the mean time, recommend the methodology of 3 -D simulation analysis in simulation. Then, we proceed with parametric study via 3 -D numerical analysis to investigate the performance of buttress wall as the basis in suggesting the principle of optimal design as well as the simplified designing chart for industrial reference. Finally, as currently the beam on elastoplastic foundation method or 2 -D plane strain numerical analysis is broadly adopted in the designing stage of excavation by the industrial field, this study shall follow these two guidelines and propose reasonable analysis method in simulation of setting up buttress wall in excavation. Expect it is helpful in the practical analysis and designing tasks. [[abstract]]深開挖工程為了避免損及鄰近構造物，在施工前，常採用一些輔助措施， 控制開挖引致之地盤位移，以達到鄰房保護的目的。近年來，扶壁常被用來作 為開挖之鄰房保護的輔助措施，然而其成效到底為何，卻一直缺少具體的驗證 結果。國內外有關扶壁機制、行為及分析方法的研究，相當的缺乏。因此到目 前為止，有關扶壁的分析及設計皆還停留在經驗的階段，對於扶壁的配置，包 括間距、長度及深度，並未有一致的看法，所以有些案例的扶壁間距相對的較 大、有些案例的扶壁長度相對較長、有些案例的扶壁深度由接近地表處開始往 下設置至連續壁底端，有些則僅至連續壁貫入深度的一半處，另有一些案例， 扶壁則僅從最終開挖面開始往下設置一段深度而已，各種設置方式皆不盡相 同，而各個案例顯現出的扶壁功效亦不盡相同，有些案例扶壁能發揮減少連續 壁側向位移的功效，有些案例則顯示功效不大，因此有關扶壁的機制、行為特 性及分析方法亟待進一步的研究。 有鑑於此，本研究將對扶壁進行一完整的研究。由於配置扶壁後之深開挖 的連續壁側向位移係屬三向度行為，因此本研究首先將採用三向度數值分析， 進行案例的模擬分析驗證，然後針對不同的扶壁配置型式進行研究，以釐清扶 壁之機制及行為特性，並建議適合的三向度模擬分析方法。其次將採用三向度 數值分析進行參數研究，以探討扶壁之成效，並據以建議最佳化設計原則，以 及簡化的設計圖表，供工程界參考使用。最後，由於目前工程界在設計深開挖 時，大多採用彈塑性基礎梁法或二向度的平面應變數值分析，因此本研究將配 合彈塑性基礎梁法及二向度的平面應變數值分析，提出設置扶壁之開挖工程的 合理分析模擬方法，希望能對實務之分析及設計工作有所助益...|$|R
