With the exception of a pair of spiracles, the gills did not open singly to the exterior as they do in sharks; rather, they were encased in a gill chamber stiffened by membrane bones and covered by a bony operculum, with a single opening to the exterior. The cleithrum bone, forming the posterior margin of the gill chamber, also functioned as anchoring for the pectoral fins. The cartilaginous fishes do not have such an anchoring for the pectoral fins. This allowed for a movable joint {{at the base of the}} fins in the early bony fishes, and would later function in a weight <b>bearing</b> <b>structure</b> in tetrapods. As part of the overall armour of rhomboid cosmin scales, the skull had a full cover of dermal bone, constituting a skull roof over the otherwise shark-like cartilaginous inner cranium. Importantly, they also had a swim bladder/lung, a feature lacking in sharks and rays.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Akron-class did away with the {{traditional}} cruciform tail and altered the shape and position of the stabilizers. The ship's stabilizers were originally designed to be secured on the hull at three main ring points, but this was changed by shortening them to have them secured at only two points, with the leading edge only attached to the intermediate frame rather than the load <b>bearing</b> <b>structure.</b> This design change came about following an incident involving the German passenger airship Graf Zeppelin, which, when taking off in 1929, had almost struck a set of power lines with its lower fin, {{which could not be}} seen from the ship's control gondala. In order to make the lower fin visible, the design was changed to shorten the fin. This proved to be a design flaw that eventually was a major contributory factor to the loss of Macon in 1935.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHistoric {{buildings}} from seismic zones {{have recorded}} important damages after earthquakes. Due to this aspect, in current design codes for consolidations of some countries there are special calculations for historic buildings. The {{development of the}} investigation methods for the damages developed in the historic <b>bearing</b> <b>structures</b> revealed {{the fact that these}} damages are differentiated by the type and intensity of the earthquake. Information on these different failure modes of the historic <b>bearing</b> <b>structures</b> is not given in the current design codes for zones with medium and reduced seismic activity. In Romania there are no specific provisions for the design of the consolidation works of historic <b>bearing</b> <b>structures,</b> even though there are two important seismic zones: Vrancea region and Banat region. The Vrancea region is characterized by deep earthquakes while the Banat region is characterized by shallow earthquakes. These two types of earthquakes produce different failure modes for similar historic buildings. In this article there are presented specific failure modes of historic buildings such as orthodox churches, catholic churches, synagogues, residential buildings, and aggregate buildings from Banat region which has moderate seismic activity. The evaluation methodology of the seismic vulnerability of buildings from historic centers developed by the University of Padova was confirmed by in situ identification of failure mechanisms recorded in historic <b>bearing</b> <b>structures</b> from Timisoara.
