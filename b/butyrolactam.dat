All anhydrides with cephalosporinic acids (VIlI) yielded symmetric anhydrides IX. Alcoholysis of IX gave cephalosporinic ester X, while aminolysis yielded amide.

40|$|Three 1 -alkyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tricyanomethanide (TCM) ionic liquids (ILs) (alkyl ¼ ethyl, butyl and hexyl) and one <b>butyrolactam</b> cation-based IL with a {{fluorinated}} anion were synthesised {{and tested}} {{in contact with}} mild steel (MS) at temperatures up to 80 degree C. The corrosion behaviour was evaluated by monitoring the morphological changes on the steel surface after testing. Exposure of MS to the IL results in two main types of degradation that depend on the IL type. General etching over the macroscopic surface of the alloy was revealed for the IL with the fluorinated anion. The 1 -alkyl- 3 -methylimidazolium TCM ILs promoted dissolution of MnS inclusions present in the steel. In the ILs with a shorter alkyl chain in the cation (alkyl ¼ ethyl, butyl), the dissolution of MnS was accompanied by generation of corrosion products around the inclusion sites, which are mainly identified as magnetite and maghemite ferrites by micro-Raman spectroscopy. The rest of the macroscopic steel surface remains unaffected. Etching resulted in significant weight loss due to removal of material, whereas no significant weight loss was revealed following MnS dissolution. <b>Butyrolactam</b> cation-based IL severely attacks MS {{with the formation of}} a plethora of corrosion products including ferrites (mainly hematite), zinc oxide, sulphates and carbonates. Addition of 500 ppm sodium molybdate to the <b>butyrolactam</b> cation-based IL resulted in efficient inhibition of etching at both room temperature and 60 degree C due to adsorption of molybdate on the alloy surface. A side effect of MS degradation is that the CO 2 absorption capacity of the ILs can be severely reduced through the transfer of metal ions and corrosion products from the metallic surface to the liquid phase. Therefore, gravimetric CO 2 absorption capacity and kinetic measurements on the selected 1 -alkyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tricyanomethanide ILs before and after their contact with MS were also conducted with the purpose to unveil and study these side effects. Moreover, CO 2 absorption experiments of the <b>butyrolactam</b> cation-based IL before and after contact with MS, {{as well as in the}} presence of a sodium molybdate inhibitor, showed that sodium molybdate has the capacity to limit significantly the etching rate without affecting the CO 2 capture performance of the IL...|$|E
30|$|The {{treatment}} with HA {{had a small}} effect on the exudation of products related to nitrogen metabolism. However, the nucleotides adenosine and thymine were exuded in a larger amount than control (Table  2), along with other nitrogenous compounds related to metabolism of nucleosides (such as pseudouridine and uric acid) (Table  2). The enhancement of glutamine pathway in the exudates from treated seedlings is compatible with significant increase of aminobutyric acid (GABA) and its intermediary product (i.e., <b>butyrolactam</b> was fourfolds more abundant).|$|E

40|$|The {{condensation}} of a diol with a silane in toluene {{yields a}} silphenylene-siloxane polymer. The reaction of stiochiometric {{amounts of the}} diol and silane produced products with molecular weights in the range 2. 0 - 6. 0 x 10 to the 5 th power. The molecular weight of the product was greatly increased by a multistep technique. The methodology for synthesis of high molecular weight polymers using a two step procedure was refined. Polymers with weight average molecular weights in excess of 1. 0 x 10 to the 6 th power produced by this method. Two more reactive silanes, bis(pyrrolidinyl) dimethylsilane and bis(gamma <b>butyrolactam)</b> dimethylsilane, are compared with the dimethyleminodimethylsilane in ability to advance the molecular weight of the prepolymer. The polymers produced are characterized by intrinsic viscosity in tetrahydrofuran.

40|$|Lactam is an {{important}} class of commodity chemicals used {{in the manufacture of}} nylons, with millions of tons of production every year. 2 -Pyrrolidone is a valuable bulk chemical with myriad applications as a solvent, polymer precursor and active pharmaceutical intermediate. A novel 2 -pyrrolidone synthase, ORF 27, from Streptomyces aizunensis was identified to catalyze the ring closing dehydration of γ-aminobutyrate. ORF 27 ’s tendency to aggregate was resolved by expression at low temperature and fusion to the maltose binding protein (MBP). Recombinant Escherichia coli was metabolically engineered for the production of 2 -pyrrolidone from glutamate by expressing both the genes encoding GadB, a glutamate decarboxylase, and ORF 27. Incorporation of a GadB mutant lacking H 465 and T 466, GadB_ΔHT, improved the efficiency of one-pot 2 -pyrrolidone biosynthesis in vivo. When the recombinant E. coli strain expressing the E. coli GadB_ΔHT mutant and the ORF 27 -MBP fusion was cultured in ZYM- 5052 medium containing 9 g/L of L-glutamate, 7. 7 g/L of L-glutamate was converted to 1. 1 g/L of 2 -pyrrolidone within 31 h, achieving 25 % molar yield from the consumed substrate. Caprolactam and valerolactam are important commodity chemicals used in the manufacture of nylons, with millions of tons produced every year. Biological production of these high valued chemicals has not been possible {{due to a lack of}} enzymes that will cyclize the ω-amino fatty acid precursors to the corresponding lactams under ambient conditions. In this study, we demonstrated proof of these bioconversions by in vitro enzyme assays. We found that ORF 27, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of ECO- 02301 in Streptomyces aizunensis, has a broad substrate spectrum and can not only cyclize γ-aminobutyric acid into <b>butyrolactam,</b> but also 5 -aminovaleric acid (5 -AVA) into valerolactam and 6 -aminohexanoic acid (6 -AHA) into caprolactam. The ORF 27 lactam formation reaction was characterized by product analysis, and ORF 27 ’s activity on the three ω-amino fatty acids were compared. Recombinant E. coli expressing ORF 27 produced valerolactam and caprolactam when 5 -AVA and 5 -AHA, respectively, were added to the culture medium. Upon co-expressing ORF 27 with a metabolic pathway that produced 5 -aminovaleric acid from lysine, we were able to demonstrate production of -valerolactam from lysine or directly from glucose. Biological production of caprolactam, valerolactam and <b>butyrolactam</b> were enabled by the recent discovery of lactam synthases that cyclize their ω-amino fatty acid precursors to the corresponding lactams. To facilitate strain optimization with regard to product yields, productivities, and titers, it is desirable to develop a high throughput screening system forspecific small-molecule detection and response. We took the chemical informatics concepts used in small molecule drug discovery, and adapted them into a metabolic engineering strategy for targeted scouting of protein sensor candidates, named “Analog Generation towards Catabolizable Chemicals”. We discovered a lactam biosensor based on the ChnR/Pb transcription factor-promoter pair. The microbial biosensor was engineered to be a single plasmid system, demonstrating dose dependent response for caprolactam, valerolactam and <b>butyrolactam</b> with great dynamic range (1. 8 - 3. 5) and wide linear range of 1 - 2 orders of magnitude. The biosensor also showed specificity against intermediates of lactam biosynthetic pathways and therefore could potentially be applied for high throughput metabolic engineering for industrially important lactam biosynthesis...|$|E
