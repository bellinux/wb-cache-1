5|$|An {{agreement}} was {{made between the}} ministry, the tunnel company and the county municipality on 6 January 1994 to <b>build</b> <b>the</b> tunnel. The company {{had the right to}} collect tolls for up to 15 years on fees dictated by the county municipality, and would have to pay NOK27 million for the tunnel, with the county paying {{for the rest of the}} costs. The construction would be the responsibility of Hordaland Public Roads Administration, with the tunnel company only responsible for their part of the financing and the collection of tolls. An {{agreement was}} made with Selmer, whereby they would charge NOK59,422,500 and take the risk of the project, including any expenditures for unknown geological conditions or similar costs increases. They were also responsible for an insurance to reclaim the investments should it be proven impossible to <b>build</b> <b>the</b> tunnel.|$|E
30|$|After {{detecting}} the failed node, deleting its corresponding MPNT and deleting {{it from the}} MPNTs of its neighbors, <b>the</b> gateway <b>builds</b> <b>the</b> DNT for each node using the Select x for less than x TCA. The gateway converts the uni-directional links in the DNT of a node into bi-directional links, which results in the FNT of that node. Similarly, <b>the</b> gateway <b>builds</b> <b>the</b> FNTs for all active nodes. Based on the FNTs of all active nodes in the network, <b>the</b> gateway <b>builds</b> <b>the</b> connectivity graph and checks the resulting network for connectivity. After ensuring that the connectivity graph is connected, <b>the</b> gateway <b>builds</b> <b>the</b> MPSPT (as in TICA and e-TICA) or MPMST (as in e-TICA 2), with an MND of four. After ensuring that the minimum power-based tree is connected, <b>the</b> gateway <b>builds</b> <b>the</b> link ranking. Based on the link ranking, the gateway assigns the channels to links.|$|R

5|$|As the Merlin was {{considered}} to be so important to the war effort, negotiations were soon started to establish an alternative production line outside the UK. Rolls-Royce staff visited a number of North American automobile manufacturers in order to select one to <b>build</b> <b>the</b> Merlin in the U.S. or Canada. Henry Ford rescinded an initial offer to <b>build</b> <b>the</b> engine in the U.S. in July 1940, and the Packard Motor Car Company was subsequently selected to take on the $130,000,000 Merlin order. Agreement was reached in September 1940, and the first Packard-built engine, a Merlin XX designated the V-1650-1, ran in August 1941.|$|E

5|$|Brin had {{originally}} {{wanted to build}} three ships, but their great cost forced him to settle for two.

5|$|Despite {{its initial}} {{focus on the}} elites, the Union was {{successful}} in raising funds from across French society. Schoolchildren and ordinary citizens gave, as did 181French municipalities.

Less idealistically, contributions came from those who hoped for American support in the French attempt to <b>build</b> <b>the</b> Panama Canal.
