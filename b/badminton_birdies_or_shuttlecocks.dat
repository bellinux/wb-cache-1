50|$|Matteuccia is a genus of ferns {{with one}} species, Matteuccia struthiopteris (common names ostrich fern, fiddlehead fern <b>or</b> <b>shuttlecock</b> fern). It is a crown-forming, colony-forming plant, {{occurring}} in temperate {{regions of the}} Northern Hemisphere in central and northern Europe, northern Asia, and northern North America. The species epithet struthiopteris comes from Ancient Greek words, struthio meaning ostrich and pterion meaning wing.|$|R

5000|$|Woody {{arrives at}} [...] "Tony Figaro's" [...] barber shop {{in hopes of}} getting a [...] "victory haircut" [...] (a then-contemporary World War II reference). Finding the shop's {{proprietor}} out for an Army physical, Woody attempts to cut his own hair {{and those of other}} customers. The first customer that comes in is a Native American who asks for a quick shampoo, and Woody then makes a mess shampooing the man's head, which then causes the man's headdress to shrink into a <b>badminton</b> <b>birdie.</b> The angry Indian then threatens to scalp Woody for [...] "giving him the bird", but Woody quickly knocks the customer out cold with a mallet and sends him out the door, where he ends up standing perfectly still in front of a tobacco shop. Shortly afterwards, Woody's second and primary customer is a burly Italian construction worker who asks for [...] "the whole works".|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} round of the inaugural tournament in 2015, Spain's Javier Colomo made a hole-in-one the par-4 9th hole, the first par four ace in the history of all three co-sanctioning tours.

50|$|A racket or racquet is {{a sports}} {{implement}} {{consisting of a}} handled frame with an open hoop across which a network of strings or catgut is stretched tightly. It is used for striking a ball <b>or</b> <b>shuttlecock</b> in games such as squash, tennis, racquetball, and badminton. Collectively, these games are known as racket sports. This predecessor to the modern game of squash, rackets, is played with 30+1⁄2 in wooden rackets. While squash equipment has evolved in the intervening century, rackets equipment has changed little.|$|R

Note that customized swings cannot contain modifiers, while most of the swings available to purchase have one level one power modifier.|$|R
5000|$|Compared {{to round}} shots, which offered a rather inefficient but {{symmetrical}} and stable aerodynamic round profile, the aerodynamic {{stability of the}} cylindro-conical shot had been an issue in early rifled weapons of the type developed by Delvigne. Through Tamisier's method, {{the resistance of the}} air behind the center of gravity of the shot was increased, thereby increasing its stability, {{in a manner similar to}} that of arrow feathers in an arrow (fletching), <b>or</b> <b>shuttlecocks.</b> The shot would thus remain stable in flight and increase greatly in efficiency. Tamisier had experimented with the ball developed by Delvigne to discover the effect of aerodynamic resistance on the trajectory of a bullet.|$|R
50|$|In PowerPlay Golf, {{players can}} choose to play to the 'easy' white flag or the more {{difficult}} black flag. If they score a <b>birdie</b> <b>or</b> better to the black flag, they earn double Stableford Points. Each golfer is compelled to take exactly three 'PowerPlays' in the first eight holes. They then {{have the option of}} a fourth 'PowerPlay' on the final hole. But if they get a net bogey or worse, they lose points from their total score.|$|R
5000|$|The Modified Stableford system awards {{points on}} each hole, {{based on the}} score {{relative}} to par. It is designed to reward aggressive play, taking chances to go for <b>birdies</b> (<b>or</b> better), as the reward for a low score on a hole is typically greater than the punishment for a poor score. For example, over a two-hole span, a birdie (+2) and a bogey (−1) will gain one point, where two pars gain nothing. The scoring operates as follows: ...|$|R

50|$|In 1994, Park Young-man told Australian {{journalist}} Eric Ellis that Kim Jong-il once {{scored a}} 34 on the course. Park continued that Kim achieved a <b>Birdie</b> <b>or</b> better on every hole and had five holes-in-one. Later, this claim was further embellished {{to say that}} he had scored 11 holes in one, and that this was on the first round played at the course in 1987, and there were 17 bodyguards who witnessed it. It is not clear whether the exaggerated version was spread by the North Korean state or foreign news reporting.|$|R
50|$|Friction is {{the main}} reason this action is effective. If a car is moving across a surface in any {{direction}} other than the direction it's pointed, it is skidding (or sliding), and a sideways load is being imposed against the tires. This causes a lot of friction, even if the tires are allowed to rotate freely. By turning the front wheels into the direction of the skid, the front wheels will become aligned with the direction of travel. The side load will no longer be imposed against the front tires, and they will then roll freely to match the speed of the vehicle. This reduces the friction between the front tires and the surface. But the rear tires will still be sliding sideways, and the greater friction that exists will cause the back end to trail directly behind the front end, similar to a <b>badminton</b> <b>birdie</b> in flight, thus the car straightens out. As the car straightens, the front wheels must be kept aligned with the direction of travel to keep the friction of the front tires at or below the friction of the rear tires, or a skid in the opposite direction will quickly develop. The key is to keep the front wheels aligned with the direction the vehicle is moving-not the direction it is pointed.|$|R

5000|$|At first Rodríguez {{used to put}} his hat {{over the}} hole {{whenever}} he made a <b>birdie</b> <b>or</b> eagle. After he heard that other golfers were complaining about his little act, he decided to try something new. Juan developed his signature [...] "toreador dance," [...] where he would make believe that the ball was a [...] "bull" [...] and that his putter was a [...] "sword," [...] and he would terminate the [...] "bull." [...] Even {{though he was a}} very small man, he had a special stance and swing with the driver that enabled him to hit the ball as far as the longest drivers on the tour. Rodríguez represented Puerto Rico on 12 World Cup teams.|$|R
2500|$|A bogey {{competition}} is a scoring format sometimes seen in at informal tournaments. Its scoring {{is similar to}} match play, except each player compares their hole score to the hole's par rating instead of the score of another player. The player [...] "wins" [...] the hole if they score a <b>birdie</b> <b>or</b> better, they [...] "lose" [...] the hole if they score a bogey or worse, and they [...] "halve" [...] the hole by scoring par. By recording only this simple win-loss-halve score on the sheet, a player can shrug off a very poorly-played hole with a simple [...] "-" [...] mark and move on. As used in competitions, the player or pair with the best win-loss [...] "differential" [...] wins the competition.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Chicken Dance", {{also known}} as the <b>Birdie</b> Song <b>or</b> the Chicken Song, is an oom-pah song and its {{associated}} fad dance is now a contemporary dance throughout the Western world.

5000|$|A key {{consideration}} is [...] "compression", typically {{determined by the}} hardness of the ball's core layers. A harder [...] "high-compression" [...] ball will fly further because of the more efficient transfer of energy into the ball, but will also transmit more of a shock through the club to the player's hands (a [...] "hard feel"). A softer [...] "low-compression" [...] ball will do just the opposite. Golfers typically prefer a softer feel, especially in the [...] "short game", as the softer ball typically also has greater backspin with lofted irons. But drive distance is also of critical importance to many players wanting {{to get on the}} green in fewer strokes for a chance at a <b>birdie</b> <b>or</b> eagle, which a softer ball will reduce by wasting some of the impact energy in its compression.|$|R

50|$|The driver {{has become}} the most {{expensive}} single club of the modern clubset, largely due to the high emphasis placed on a player's drive distance; a longer drive gets the ball closer to the green in fewer strokes allowing for better chances of a <b>birdie</b> <b>or</b> eagle. While drivers are available as cheaply as $20, these are mainly marketed at junior players; the price range for drivers marketed to adult amateur players is generally between $130-$500, with custom-made clubs for high-end players and touring professionals costing thousands or even {{tens of thousands of dollars}} (in the case of prototype or preproduction clubs supplied by a sponsor club-maker). As a comparison, the upper end of the retail drivers, $500, is comparable to the price of an entire quality matched set of irons, and the next most expensive single clubs, the putter and the fairway woods, generally range from $100-$350.|$|R

5000|$|Wedges, and the golfer's [...] "short game", {{have come}} to be {{emphasized}} by pro players and teachers/coaches as an area of critical importance. By simple math, with par for a hole based on 2 putts, and at least one additional stroke needed to get the ball on the green, a scratch golfer will take up to 54 strokes on a typical par-72 course with the intention of getting on the green and/or in the hole; only {{about a third of the}} strokes taken in a round will be with a wood or long iron with the main intent being distance. In cases where the player doesn't make [...] "green in regulation" [...] (meaning the ball is not on the green with two strokes left for putts), shots normally taken as putts must instead be used to approach, and so must be very accurate in direction and distance in order to set the ball up for a one-putt par (the chip shot and putt combination is called an [...] "up and down") <b>or</b> even a <b>birdie</b> <b>or</b> eagle made with the chip shot itself.

6000|$|Mr. Magnet {{had begun}} with modest disavowals.

There were three {{characters}} in the story, a bluebottle and two Scotsmen. (Laughter.) The bluebottle buzzed on the pane, otherwise a profound silence reigned. This was broken by one of the Scotsmen trying to locate the bluebottle with zoölogical exactitude. Said this Scotsman: 'Sandy, I am thinking if yon fly is a <b>birdie</b> <b>or</b> a beastie.' The other replied: 'Man, don't spoil good whiskey with religious conversation.' (Laughter.) He was tempted, Mr. Magnet resumed, to ask himself and them why it was that they should spoil the aftereffects of a most excellent and admirably served dinner by an academic discussion on British humour. At first he was pained by the thought that they proposed to temper their hospitality with a demand for a speech. A closer inspection showed that he was to introduce a debate and that others were to speak, and that was a new element in their hospitality. Further, he was permitted to choose the subject so that he could bring their speeches within the range of his comprehension. (Laughter.) His was an easy task. He could make it easier; {{the best thing to do}} would be to say nothing at all. (Laughter.)" ...|$|R
