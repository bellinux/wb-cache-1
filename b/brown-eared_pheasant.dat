Gap analyses are efficient and reliable tools for prioritizing habitat conservation efforts, especially when considering endangered species. We propose a conservation plan for the <b>brown–eared</b> <b>pheasant,</b> Crossoptilon mantchuricum, by identifying protection gap areas based on 14 existing nature reserves. A total of 45 locality sites and 11 environmental variables were selected according to the characteristics of habitat use of the <b>brown–eared</b> <b>pheasant</b> and applied to a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model to obtain the species distribution. The MaxEnt model results showed a high prediction accuracy. The gap analysis results revealed that the Luliang Mountains in Shanxi and the Xiaowutai Mountains in Hebei had protection gaps. We found 458 km 2 of optimum habitat and 1, 390 km 2 of moderately suitable habitat within the national nature reserve range. However, almost 1, 861 km 2 of the optimum habitat and 17, 035 km 2 of the moderately suitable habitat were unprotected, equivalent to 9. 0 % and 82. 1 %, respectively, of the total suitable habitat. Most of the unprotected area comprised moderately suitable habitat for <b>brown–eared</b> <b>pheasant</b> and should be prioritized in future conservation efforts. There are nine nature reserves along a north–to–south range in the Luliang Mountains that form a wildlife habitat corridor. To maintain the integrity, originality, and continuity of these habitats and thus protect brown–eared pheasants, local conservation departments should be strengthened to improve provincial nature reserve management and successfully carry out conservation efforts...|$|E
