This effect of EPSs has been shown previously (Lindström et al. 2012). The <b>bulking</b> <b>effect</b> was not shown by Pd 2.6 R {{probably due to the}} concentration of EPS being too low to impart a significant <b>effect.</b> The <b>bulking</b> <b>effect</b> of polysaccharides is often caused by increased bacterial activity or increased water holding capacity. The faecal out-put and amount of water contained within the faeces (11 - 12.5 %) was not different between groups indicating that bacterial activity was causing the <b>bulking</b> <b>effect.</b> The EPS from Pd 2.6 was probably acting as a substrate for various bacteria and further studies characterizing the microbiota would be interesting to perform trying to elucidate what kind of bacteria that were stimulated by the EPS. If these bacteria are belonging to the genera Bifidobacterium and/or Lactobacillus the EPS might be considered prebiotic.|$|R

The origin of such a range of diverse phenomena is unclear, and consequently so too is the importance of a number of parameters including SiNW type (top down or bottom up), stress concentration, electrostatic field effects, or surface chemistry. Here, we observe all these PZR behaviors in a single set of nominally p-type, ⟨ 110 ⟩ oriented, top-down SiNWs at uniaxial tensile stresses up to 0. 5 [*]MPa. Longitudinal π-coefficients varying from − 800 [*]×[*] 10 − 11 [*]Pa− 1 to 3000 [*]×[*] 10 − 11 [*]Pa− 1 are measured.

40|$|Title: Superconductivity and {{electronic}} properties of γ-U alloys and their hydrides. Author: Ilya Tkach Department / Institute: Department of Condensed Matter Physics, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University Supervisor of the doctoral thesis: Doc. RNDr. Ladislav Havela, CSc., Department of Condensed Matter Physics, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, Prague, The Czech Republic Abstract: Low-temperature electronic properties for U-Mo and U-Zr splats stabilized in γ-U were investigated. Magnetic measurements revealed Pauli paramagnetic behavior with temperature independent susceptibility for U-Mo alloys. U-Mo and U- Zr splats become superconducting at low temperatures with Tc up to 2. 1 K and critical field 5 - 6 T. The superconductivity of -U {{can be considered}} as a <b>bulk</b> <b>effect</b> and can be described by the BCS theory, while -U superconductivity is not a real <b>bulk</b> <b>effect.</b> U-Mo and U-Zr alloys absorb hydrogen at high pressures (p ≥ 4. 5 bar) and form hydrides with stoichiometry analogous to UH 3. The hydrides with Mo have an amorphous structure based on β-UH 3 phase, while hydrides with Zr have a crystalline structure of the -UH 3 type. (UH 3) 1 -xMox hydrides are ferromagnetic with enhanced TC up to 202 K and magnetic moments 1. 1 μB/U in comparison with pure β-UH 3 (175 K; 0. 87 μB/U) [...] . ...|$|E
