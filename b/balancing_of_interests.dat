2500|$|Part VI of the {{decision}} discussed whether the statute impermissibly targeted the Communist Party as the sole political party seeking the violent overthrow of the United States government. If the statute had penalized anyone who advocated violent overthrow of the government, Vinson held, there would be new constitutional doubts raised. But it was the Court's long-held tenet that statutes should be construed constitutionally wherever possible. Subsequently, Vinson interpreted Section 9(h) narrowly as barring from union office those who actually advocated overthrow {{of the government and}} not those who (for example) believed it would happen without their assistance. Vinson reiterated that the <b>balancing</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> in Part V had found the infringement on free speech pemissible. But how did this reconcile with Reynolds v. United States?

2500|$|The {{question}} {{addressed in}} Part IV {{of the decision}} was whether the Communist Party presented such circumstances. [...] The unions had argued that a [...] "clear and present danger" [...] test {{be applied to the}} legislation, as this was a First Amendment issue, but could not agree on how to do so. Vinson rejected this test as mechanical. But Congress had not concluded in enacting the Taft-Hartley Act that expressing communist beliefs was a danger; rather, Congress had wished to eliminate impediments to interstate commerce. The problem with political strikes, Vinson asserted, was that rather than allowing speech to combat speech in the [...] "marketplace of ideas", strikes constitute force and coercion which Congress has every authority to regulate. One of the unions had argued that political strikes did not constitute such an imminent danger as to pass constitutional scrutiny, but Vinson rejected this once more as a mechanical application of an inapt test. [...] Rather, Vinson argued, the Constitution permits infringement of constitutionally protected rights when a sound truck invades the privacy of the home (Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77 (1949)), unauthorized parades disrupt traffic (Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569, (1941)), the health of children is at stake (Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944)), or the provision of public services is affected (United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75 (1947)). Advocating a <b>balancing</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> and citing Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.

2500|$|Justice O'Connor, {{presenting}} the (4-5) dissenting opinion, {{stated that the}} historical evidence was not uniform in rejecting Atwater's proposed rule and reasoned that the Fourth Amendment required a <b>balancing</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> {{in the case of}} an arrest for a fine-only misdemeanor. [...] The court dissent in Atwater precluded the sole use of probable cause in Whren v. United States, , where the Court had held that, on balance, it was reasonable to allow the police to make a traffic stop whenever they spied a violation of the traffic laws, although a traffic stop was a seizure. But, because of the length of the typical traffic stop and the fact that most drivers are free to go after it is done, such a seizure was commensurate with the magnitude of the violation and sufficient to ensure that the offender would appear later in court if necessary. [...] The dissent elucidated, “probable cause” and “extraordinary” circumstances as delineated in Terry v. Ohio, Whren v. United States, etc., have also proved less than problematic. [...] Strong argument to the contrary also remains as to the merit of the majority opinion that “personal § 1983 liability for the misapplication of a constitutional standard…would guarantee increased litigation.” In Atwater, the dissent further argued that Atwater could not have been characterized as a possible flight risk by the arresting officer, since she was known to him and was an established member of the community and that respondents failed to substantiate any demonstrable merit for the arrest decision. They further noted that arrest for a fine-only misdemeanor was not reasonable because sending someone to jail for up to 48 hours (the time necessary to get him or her before a magistrate to be released) was too great an intrusion upon the personal liberty interests of anyone who had committed a relatively minor offense as would only merit such a fine as punishment.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesControversy {{surrounds}} the upstream petroleum industry. Although {{the benefit of}} petroleum resources is beyond dispute, the exploitation of petroleum resources comes at a price, as history has shown time and again. Not only does petroleum exploitation have {{detrimental effects on the}} environment, but host countries often are worse off than countries with little or no petroleum resources. This "resource curse" is partially the result of flawed regulatory frameworks for petroleum resource extraction in host countries. This thesis identifies three elements that must be present in a country's regulatory framework for petroleum extraction if the resource curse phenomenon is to be avoided and benefit s from petroleum are to be maximised. These elements are: transparency, accountability and a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> between the petroleum companies and the host nation. Namibia and South Africa are not yet major players in the international upstream petroleum industry. There is accordingly not much academic engagement with petroleum law in these two jurisdictions. The courts have also not yet had the opportunity to scrutinise the legislation regulating the upstream petroleum industries of South Africa and Namibia. There are, however, indications that both countries may possess viable quantities of petroleum resources. In anticipation of the possibility of finding commercially viable quantities of petroleum, South Africa and Namibia have enacted legislation to regulate the upstream petroleum industry, but the efficiency of the legislation, specifically how it reflects the elements of transparency, accountability and <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> have not yet been considered. The research for this thesis is driven by the question of how the regulatory framework for petroleum exploitation in South Africa and Namibia embraces the elements of transparency, accountability and <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this thesis is to examine the regulatory frameworks for upstream petroleum resources in South Africa and Namibia in anticipation of the demands that will be placed on law as the sectors grow. In doing so, this thesis scrutinises the legislation in South Africa and Namibia {{to determine the extent to}} which the three crucial elements of transparency, accountability and <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> between the petroleum company and the host nation are reflected in the regulatory frameworks for petroleum resources...|$|R

5000|$|The Supreme Court reversed, 6-3. Justice Scalia, {{writing for}} the majority, stated that all Fourth Amendment {{inquiries}} look first to {{the intent of the}} Framers of the Constitution. If that does not provide an answer, then we must evaluate the search or seizure under traditional standards of reasonableness by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual's privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests. Looking to Carroll v. United States, the first automobile exception case from 1925, the Court found there that the Framers would hold that the whole car could be searched if there was probable cause to believe it contained contraband. Likewise, the Court opined in United States v. Ross that the Carroll doctrine permitted searches of all containers found in a vehicle there was probable cause to search. Going one step further, however, the Court held that even if the historical perspective was not enough, a balancing of the relative interests weigh decidedly in favor of allowing searches of passenger's belongings because of the reduced expectation of privacy in and the mobility of automobiles. Also, passengers in cars are more likely engaged in a common enterprise with the driver and have the same interest in concealing the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing. Also, their proximity enables them to hide contraband in other's belongings as readily as in other containers in the car ... perhaps even surreptitiously, without the passenger's knowledge or permission. While these factors will not always be present, the <b>balancing</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> must be conducted with an eye to the generality of cases.
