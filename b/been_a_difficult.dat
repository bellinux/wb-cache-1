5|$|Out {{of respect}} for the seriously-injured Bianchi, the top three {{finishers}} did not spray champagne. At the podium interviews, conducted by the 1992 World Champion Nigel Mansell, Hamilton said that it had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> race weekend and his speed {{near the end of the}} race was reminiscent of the 2008 British Grand Prix. Rosberg called it a good weekend for his team, and congratulated Hamilton on the victory. Vettel said that he was lucky that the safety car came out, and was happy with his performance. At a later press conference, Hamilton said that he was confident in his car's balance when he passed Rosberg on lap 28, and saw no difference in the amount of standing water on the track when more heavy rain fell. Although Rosberg's car was set up similar to Hamilton's, he was unhappy with its balance and tried to adjust it during his pit stop. According to Vettel, the weather was borderline and his team decided to make a pit stop when it deteriorated.|$|E

Former New Zealand cricket captain, Martin Crowe stated that he did not believe that Redmond is good enough to play Test cricket, but has conceded that his first year in Test cricket in which he {{averaged}} 23.00 in seven matches had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> one.

25|$|The CAP {{has always}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> area of EU policy to reform; it {{is a problem}} that began in the 1960s and one that has {{continued}} to the present, albeit less severely. Changes to the CAP are proposed by the European Commission, after a public consultation, which then sends its proposals to the Council and to the European Parliament. Both the Council and the European Parliament have to agree to any changes. The Parliament was involved in the process of change {{for the first time in}} 2013. The involvement of the Parliament, which represents the citizens, increases the democratic legitimacy of the CAP. Outside Brussels proper, the farming lobby's power has been a factor determining EU agricultural policy since the earliest days of integration.|$|E

25|$|The D has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> money-making venture {{for some}} time. Originally {{constructed}} as a coal hauling route {{and when that}} business declined it proved difficult to turn a profit. It operates {{in some of the}} most rural areas of New York State, and very few industrial customers between Binghamton and Rouses Point remain. The railroad's current prognosis is arguably better than it has been in a long time. Along with the NYC connection, haulage agreements with other railroads are greatly increasing traffic. CP has been steadily using their high power AC traction locomotives on their road trains that run on the line, instead of their aging SD40-2 models. This is an indication of the increasing importance of reliable service. There are also major signal and track projects underway to modernize the former D lines.|$|E
25|$|For most people, {{the first}} {{symptoms}} result from atheroma progression within the heart arteries, most commonly {{resulting in a}} heart attack and ensuing debility. However, the heart arteries, because (a) they are small (from about 5mm down to microscopic), (b) they are hidden deep within the chest and (c) they never stop moving, have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> target organ to track, especially clinically in individuals who are still asymptomatic. Additionally, all mass-applied clinical strategies focus on both (a) minimal cost and (b) the overall safety of the procedure. Therefore, existing diagnostic strategies for detecting atheroma and tracking response to treatment have been extremely limited. The methods most commonly relied upon, patient symptoms and cardiac stress testing, do not detect any symptoms of the problem until atheromatous disease is very advanced because arteries enlarge, not constrict in response to increasing atheroma. It is plaque ruptures, producing debris and clots which obstruct blood flow downstream, sometimes also locally (as seen on angiograms), which reduce/stop blood flow. Yet these events occur suddenly and are not revealed in advance by either stress testing, stress tests or angiograms.|$|E
500|$|Solis, who {{had never}} {{become part of the}} inner circle of presidential advisors, said it had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> {{decision}} and Obama praised her work as secretary. [...] Reflecting upon her tenure, Solis generally garnered praise from labor unions and leading Democrats for her stricter enforcement of job safety regulations and more aggressive pursuit of wage and hour violators. Other leaders and analysts in the labor field thought her performance as secretary was underwhelming, with minimal public visibility and no memorable legacy left behind. [...] All agreed that she operated in a difficult political environment, with the effects of the Great Recession still being felt, Republicans staunchly opposed to labor-based initiatives, and the Obama administration's attentions focused elsewhere. Business groups, meanwhile, continued to characterize her as having been uncooperative in her dealings with them.|$|E

Although The Indian Express spoke positively of the cinematography and the film's story, it noted that [...] "the message that the film carries with it tends to get diluted towards the climax. Praising the film's cast for their performance and the cinematography of Binod Pradhan, Taran Ardash wrote that the film would be successful with the urban audiences. The Hindustan Times summarized the film as being a [...] "well-scripted, skilfully crafted [...] thought-provoking entertainer". Saisuresh Sivaswamy of Rediff.com wrote that films like Rang De Basanti can easily get into [...] "preachiness", but believed Mehra got his message across while avoiding this, also appreciating the music, cinematography, dialogues and art direction. The Hindu credited Kamlesh Pandey for writing a story that would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> film to make, but it added {{by saying that the}} transformation of the youngsters into heroes seemed poetic.

Burge was suspended for two weeks for breaking the club's [...] "social media guidelines" [...] after club management claimed he refused to apologise for the incident. On 12 April 2013, with three games left of the season, Burge left the club by mutual consent. Club chairman Paul Wildes stated that [...] "this has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> decision for both parties".

500|$|W. D. Hamilton's work on kin {{selection}} {{contributed to}} the emergence of the discipline of sociobiology. The existence of altruistic behaviors has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> problem for evolutionary theorists from the beginning. Significant progress was made in 1964 when Hamilton formulated the inequality in kin selection known as Hamilton's rule, which showed how eusociality in insects (the existence of sterile worker classes) and many other examples of altruistic behavior could have evolved through kin selection. Other theories followed, some derived from game theory, such as reciprocal altruism. In 1975, E. O. Wilson published the influential and highly controversial book [...] which claimed evolutionary theory could help explain many aspects of animal, including human, behavior. Critics of sociobiology, including Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, claimed that sociobiology greatly overstated the degree to which complex human behaviors could be determined by genetic factors. They also claimed that the theories of sociobiologists often reflected their own ideological biases. Despite these criticisms, work has continued in sociobiology and the related discipline of evolutionary psychology, including work on other aspects of the altruism problem.|$|E

2500|$|In 1975-1976 Caird took {{on almost}} {{full-time}} administration, serving as Moderator of the United Reformed Church, and {{during his tenure}} he visited South Africa. His {{work in the fields}} of Old and New Testament (he remains one of the few modern biblical interpreters to have held chairs in both) led to four honorary doctorates (including the Oxford D.D.), election to the British Academy (and the granting of its Burkitt Medal for Biblical Studies), and appointment to be the Dean Ireland's Professor and Professorial Fellow at The Queen's College, Oxford. But acceptance of the Dean Ireland's post was not automatic for Caird, according to Mansfield College historian Elaine Kaye. [...] "Although he had been allowed to hold his honorary University post as Reader along with the Principalship of Mansfield, the University was not prepared to allow him to hold this more senior post jointly with Mansfield. It was at once a blow and an honour for the College. For Caird it may have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> decision; but his final choice indicates that the opportunity to spend the remaining years of his career as a scholar and a teacher, rather than an administrator-cum-teacher, was to him, welcome".|$|E
