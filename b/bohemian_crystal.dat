During the 1960s, he purchased the century-old, 100-light <b>crystal</b> <b>Bohemian</b> chandelier from Her Majesty's Theatre, Montreal, following its demolition, {{and put it}} on display on Ogilvy's ground floor, where it still hangs today. Nesbitt also established a policy whereby Ogilvy's would carry items that its clientele would enjoy, rather than merchandise only designed to make the most money: ...|$|R
50|$|The hall is {{actually}} a concrete building within a brick building. The building was designed by FFKR Architects and acoustical design services were provided by Dr. Cyril M. Harris with the outcome of creating an environment of acoustic excellence. Harris was the acoustical consultant for the remodeled Avery Fisher Hall in New York City, the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., and Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The hall is rectangular in shape, similar {{to some of the}} world's finest symphony halls, such as the Grosser Musikvereinssaal in Vienna, the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, and Symphony Hall in Boston. The stage was designed strictly for use as a concert hall, and has no proscenium - meaning that it is an extension of the audience. Cello and bass players are also encouraged to make holes in the stage with their endpins, so that their sound resonates with the wood of the hall, and not just their instrument. To enter the hall, patrons must pass through sound lock corridors designed to isolate the concert hall from the noise and confusion of the lobby. Inside the hall, there are convex curved surfaces on the walls and ceilings. There are no perfect ninety degree angles in the hall, because of their effect on sound. Suspended from the ceiling are six 16 x 16 ft brass chandeliers with 18,000 hand-cut beads and prisms of <b>Bohemian</b> <b>crystals</b> imported from Austria and Czechoslovakia. The lobby is four stories high, with a white oak and brass ceiling, and a 5400 sq ft glass curtain or wall which covers much of the East face of the triangular-shaped lobby. The lobby itself is an architectural marvel due to its many tiers, the staircase that goes upwards and to the left along with the triangular shape of the enclosure, the gold leafing that covers all visible sides of the stairs and balconies, and the 30 ft red blown-glass sculpture (The Olympic Tower, by renowned glass artist Dale Chihuly) that is displayed prominently in the middle. This piece was purchased in 2002, after private donors and the Salt Lake Organizing Committee raised the $625,000 Chihuly was asking for. The Olympic Tower was valued at $900,000, although Chihuly was willing to sell it at the lower cost under the agreement that it would stay at Abravanel Hall and that the public would be able to view it without attending a show.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} 20 years the {{restaurant}} was expanded and became furnished with increasingly luxurious imported materials typical of the Gilded Age, including Honduran mahogany, French furniture, Italian and French sculpture and paintings, English silver and <b>Bohemian</b> <b>crystal</b> lighting.|$|E
50|$|Bohemia {{turned out}} expert {{craftsmen}} who artfully worked with crystal. <b>Bohemian</b> <b>crystal</b> became {{famous for its}} excellent cut and engraving. They became skilled teachers of glass-making in neighbouring and distant countries. By {{the middle of the}} 19th century, a technical glass-making school system was created that encouraged traditional and innovative techniques as well as thorough technical preparation.|$|E
50|$|The 1927-30 Central European International Cup was {{the first}} edition of the Central European International Cup and was held between September 18, 1927 and May 11, 1930. The tournament's {{structure}} included a round-robin competition for the five teams involved. As the winner was to receive a <b>Bohemian</b> <b>crystal</b> cup offered by Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia Antonín Švehla, the tournament became known as the Antonín Švehla Cup.|$|E
50|$|From {{as early}} as 750 years ago, the shadowy picture of the oldest German-Bohemian {{glass-maker}} family Friedrich emerges, who contributed greatly towards {{the creation of the}} world-famous Bohemian glass (also called <b>Bohemian</b> <b>Crystal).</b> In pre-Hussite times they produced amazing works of vitreous art near Daubitz, nowadays called Doubice. During the 16th and 17th centuries, {{as a result of the}} family’s development of their glass factory in Oberkreibitz, today Horní Chribská, Bohemian glass art enjoyed its first heyday.|$|E

Among other objects, there is a beautiful ‘magic’ mirror, which possesses the property of reflecting {{the most beautiful woman}} in the entire realm. The Queen, seeing her own reflection, is delighted, much to the joy of the King, who buys the mirror. The Queen, rejoicing, invites the courtiers to dance.|$|E

Fourteen tons of gold was used to adorn the interior ceiling of the palace. The world's largest <b>Bohemian</b> <b>crystal</b> chandelier, a gift from Queen Victoria, is in the centre hall. The palace has the largest collection of Bohemian and Baccarat crystal chandeliers in the world, and even the staircases are made of Baccarat crystal.|$|E

50|$|Whereas the Topkapı has {{exquisite}} {{examples of}} Iznik tiles and Ottoman carving, the Dolmabahçe palace is extensively decorated with gold and crystal. Fourteen tonnes of gold {{were used to}} gild the ceilings. The world's largest <b>Bohemian</b> <b>crystal</b> chandelier is in the Ceremonial Hall. The chandelier {{was assumed to be}} a gift from Queen Victoria, however in 2006 the receipt was found showing it was paid for in full. It has 750 lamps and weighs 4.5 tonnes. Dolmabahçe has the largest collection of Bohemian and Baccarat crystal chandeliers in the world. The famous Crystal Staircase has the shape of a double horseshoe and is built of Baccarat crystal, brass and mahogany.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, the StB {{documents}} on Zilk were made public. These documents record 58 meetings between Zilk and secret police agents during 1965-68. Zilk had provided {{information about the}} political situation in Austria and assessments of individual Austrian politicians; for this he was paid in money and goods such as <b>Bohemian</b> <b>crystal</b> glass. After the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia (August 1968) Ladislav Bittman, one of the agents in contact with Zilk, defected to the West and leaked information about him. Some Czech media (as well as the old StB documents) speculated that the continued political and journalistic career of Zilk, in spite of being uncovered, was due to some other agency (CIA is suggested) recruiting and supporting him.|$|E
50|$|The {{hotel has}} six banqueting halls, {{the largest of}} which {{accommodates}} up to 650 people. The Royal Hall, {{the largest and most}} ornate, was originally the hotel's main dining room. It is accessed through a wrought iron gate similar to those that enclose the choirs of several Andalusian cathedrals. Inside, eleven bronze chandeliers hung with <b>Bohemian</b> <b>crystal</b> and plated in gold descend from a palatial coffered ceiling. Large arched doorways inlaid with mahogany and inlaid tiles (azulejos) lead to a terrace over the garden of the hotel. Other neoclassical banqueting halls or salons—Andalusia, Híspalis and Cartuja—feature arched doors and windows with frames of golden stucco, more Bohemian glass chandeliers and marble floors.|$|E
50|$|Bohemian glass-workers {{discovered}} potash {{combined with}} chalk created a clear colourless glass {{that was more}} stable than glass from Italy. In the 16th century the term <b>Bohemian</b> <b>crystal</b> emerged {{for the first time}} in history to distinguish its qualities from the glass coming from other places. This glass contained no lead as is commonly suspected. This Czech glass could be cut with a wheel. In addition, resources such as wood for firing the kilns and for burning down to ashes were used to create potash. There were also copious amounts of limestone and silica. In the 17th century, Caspar Lehmann, gem cutter to Emperor Rudolf II in Prague, adapted to glass the technique of gem engraving with copper and bronze wheels. During the era, the Czech lands became the dominant producer of decorative glassware and the local manufacture of glass earned international reputation in high Baroque style from 1685 to 1750.|$|E
5000|$|A {{portion of}} Kuthira Malika has been {{converted}} to a Palace Museum that houses some of the assets owned by the Travancore Royal Family. Although 80 rooms are there in the palace, only 20 are open for visitors. A guided tour is available inside the palace. [...] The palace collections include 14 life-size Kathakali mannequins, Belgian and Italian mirrors, crystal chandeliers, paintings, a giant Belgian harpoon, [...] armaments, musical instruments, traditional furniture, greek statues, a musical tree which produces 8 sounds on tapping, and other artifacts. On {{the right side of}} the mannequins are the ivory cradles of various sizes. The palace has on display two royal thrones, one made from 24 elephant tusks (Dantasimhasana) [...] and the other of <b>Bohemian</b> <b>crystal</b> with the Tranvancore emblem 'conch' adorning the top of the backrest. The palace has a large collection of idols and sculptures made from white marble.|$|E
5000|$|The Czechoslovak Classroom {{combines}} {{elements of}} a Slovak farmhouse, country church, and the Charles University in Prague while detailing men who contributed to Czechoslovak culture. The motto of the classroom, and of the former Czechoslovak government in exile, is proclaimed by the inscription of [...] "Pravda Vítězí" [...] which translates to [...] "Truth Will Prevail" [...] and surrounds a bronze relief portrait of the first President and founder of Czechoslovakia Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. In a wrought-iron case near the window bay, a letter penned by the hand of Masaryk to students at the University of Pittsburgh recalls John Amos Comenius' belief that [...] "education is the workshop of humanity". All woodwork, except the furniture, is made of larch wood which grows to great heights in the Carpathian Mountains. The ceiling, with flat boards overlapping each other between heavy beams, is painted by Prague artists Karel and Marie Svolinsky and depicts botanically accurate flowers and plants of Czechoslovakia and reflects a typical Slovak farmer's home and the style of country churches. A [...] "tree of life" [...] design on the rear wall surrounds {{the text of the}} proclamation by King of Bohemia and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire Charles IV that marked the founding of the University of Prague in 1348. The plaster reveals of the bay window area is decorated by murals of miraculous trees bearing flowers and fruits and harboring animals, birds, and insects reflecting [...] "peasant writings" [...] and executed by the artists in freehand. Ceiling panels portray eight famous persons in Czech and Slovak history from the 9th through 19th centuries including Cyril and Methodius who created the Cyrillic script, Waclaw who was the [...] "Good King Wenceslaus" [...] of the Christmas Carol, Jan Hus who was a champion of Czech religious freedom, John Amos Comenius who is considered the father of modern education, Jan Kollar a Slovak poet who called for Slavic unity, Ľudovít Štúr who developed the Slovak literary language, and Bishop Stefan Moyzes who pioneered popular education in Slovakia. Intarsia done by V. Kopka of Moravia are found on the entrance door panels and the professor's desk and lectern which depicts university academic disciplines. Embroidery, lace, <b>Bohemian</b> <b>crystal,</b> and historical documents are displayed in the wall cabinet.|$|E
40|$|Bohemian Baroque Cut Glass Bohemian Baroque {{cut glass}} {{dates back to}} the reign of Rudolph II., when {{numerous}} artists came to Prague including gem cutters and, later on, also glassmakers such as Caspar Lehmann. The promising development was interrupted by the Thirty Years' War. However, that was followed by a prosperous period and advances in perfecting the glass, which {{came to be known as}} "Bohemian crystal" due to its properties that were similar to rock crystal produced at an earlier time. <b>Bohemian</b> <b>crystal</b> triggered a development in engraving and cutting techniques for which it was suitable due to its unusual hardness, and soon the Bohemian cut glass attained an exquisite quality. The development of Bohemian glassmaking was also influenced by other countries with their own specific glass production, such as Italy and Germany. The products, which were purely status symbols at first, gradually became popular and reached the wider public. The motifs of the Bohemian Baroque cut glass came primarily from graphic works and coins, and were further influenced by the style of the time and clients' wishes. Two regions with the highest concentration of glassworks gradually developed in the lands of the Bohemian Crown. The first was South Bohemia and the second North Bohemia, which also became a centre for [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Handmade {{glass is}} one of the most typical Czech items that has made our country famous {{throughout}} the world for several centuries. Although it is a very small sector of our economy, which by money value contributes only 0. 1 % to the overall manufacturing sector and 1. 2 % to the group of glass products, it represents a significant impact on employment in the Liberecký region (10 %). The importance of this sector, however, lies in not the quantity and unit value of production, but in the profound importance its producers place on quality. The quality of our handmade glass is still vastly superior to the manual mass production of any of the Eastern countries. For a region such as Novy Bor in North Bohemia which has traditionally been synonymous with glass making, great handmade glass has a significance which transcends economics. It is also what integrates and binds the social fabric, and gives the community its identity. The crisis that hit the industry in 2008 was primarily due to the developments of previous years. It showed us that the world stature of <b>Bohemian</b> <b>crystal,</b> its traditions, brands and trade marks cannot be sustained without investment. Without continuing investment, the beautiful craftsmanship of glass making cannot be developed, nor preserved. Glass blowing, and glass making craftsmanship - like [...] ...|$|E
