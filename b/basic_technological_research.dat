He obtained his M.Sc. in Physics from the University of Warsaw in 1968 with specializations in Biophysics. Then he has worked for several years at the Institute of <b>Basic</b> <b>Technological</b> <b>Research</b> Polish Academy of Sciences on theory of networks and of sol-gel transitions in macromolecular systems. He got his Ph.D. in Physics from the Institute of Physics Polish Academy of Sciences in 1973. Then he has worked on theory of intracranial pressure at the Department of Neurosurgery, Medical Research Center Polish Academy of Sciences. From there he left with his family to become professor in Physics and in Biophysics at the University of Kinshasa, Kongo (then Zaïre, French-speaking), where he was caught by the martial law in Poland. He has been a fellow in Max Planck Institute of Biophysical Chemistry in Goettingen, Germany (1982-1984) and then with German Fremdenpass, because Polish People Republic refused to give him a valid passport, he moved as a visiting professor to Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, USA (1984-1986).|$|E

40|$|This {{special issue}} of Science and Public Policy takes up the {{recently}} discussed problem of political coordination in the ‘third phase of innovation'. The introduction prepares the analytical ground for the four case studies that follow. It develops {{the image of a}} ‘knowledge space' consisting of the four ‘core' areas of innovation policy — higher education, professional education, <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> and <b>technological</b> <b>research</b> — and uses insights from administrative science and a number of science and policy studies that discuss the need for coordination in policy-making in knowledge and innovation systems. Different types of coordination are distinguished as well as various institutional levels within the political system that {{play a role in the}} overall capacity of improving political coordination. A number of problems and expectations are raised which are the starting point of reflections in the ensuing case studie...|$|R
40|$|An {{excess of}} 230 cyclotrons are at present in {{operation}} {{in many countries}} of the world. The majority of these cyclotrons are meant for <b>basic</b> scientific and <b>technological</b> <b>research</b> and advanced medical applications, such as the production of short-lived PET and longer-lived SPECT radiopharmaceuticals, as well as radiotherapy of tumours. Intense fields of ionising radiation are produced during the operation of cyclotrons. Today’s cyclotron professionals often have to solve a diverse radiological safety and decision-making related tasks, which require a tedious and time consuming reference search and computation of intricate engineering/technical problems. Hence, as a practical problem-solution aid and scientific compendium, a hyperlinked database (NEA- 1694 SATIF/CYCLO-RADSAFE) of scientific and technical reference work encompassing all major radiological safety related issues of cyclotrons has been developed. The main goal {{of this paper is}} to introduce the latest version of the database to the cyclotron user communities...|$|R

40|$|Prikazali smo analizo obremenitev nastalih med periodičnim krožnim odrezovanjem z vrtečim se rezkalnim orodjem. Raziskavo smo opravili z namenom, da bi določili specifično rezalno silo, ki predstavlja osnovni tehnološki parameter. Analizirali smo vplivnost 2 snovnih spremenljivk, in sicer smeri odrezovanja in vlažnosti obdelovanega materiala, ter vplivnost podajalne hitrosti kot osnovne tehnološke spremenljivke. Preizkušance različnih uravnovešenih vlažnosti smo izdelali iz bukovine (Fagus Silvatica). Zasnovali in izdelali smo sistem za merjenje vzporedne in normalne komponente rezalne sile na gibajočem se obdelovancu. Podajalna hitrost obdelovanca je bila med odrezovanjem konstantna. Specifična rezalna sila se z naraščajočo globino odrezovanja in kotom odrezovanja povečuje potenčno. V obeh primerih dosegata regresijska koeficienta vrednost 0, 99. Specifična rezalna sila je bila pri vlažnostih lesa 8, 2 in 18 % skoraj identična, pri 12 % pa smo zasledili porast vrednosti. Podajalna hitrost na specifično rezalno silo ne vpliva, vpliva pa na velikost vzporedne in normalne komponente rezalne sile. Analysis of {{the load}} under which the milling tool is at {{periodic}} circular cutting is shown. The research was performed in order to define the specific cutting force representing the <b>basic</b> <b>technological</b> parameter. The <b>research</b> includes {{the analysis of the}} influence of 2 material variables - the change of the direction of cutting and moisture content of the used material, and the influence of the feed speed as the <b>basic</b> <b>technological</b> variable. The tested samples, with different moisture contents, were made of beech wood (Fagus Silvatica). The system for measuring the parallel and the normal components of the cutting force on the moving test model was planned and made out. The feed speed of the test sample was constant during the cutting. The specific cutting force was increasing potentially along with the increasing depth and the angle of the cutting. In both cases the regressive coefficients reached 0. 99 of value. The specific cutting force was almost identical at moisture contents of 8. 2 and 18 %, while at 12 % the increase in value was traced. The feed speed did not influence the specific cutting force but it influenced the size of the parallel and the normal components of the cutting force...|$|R
