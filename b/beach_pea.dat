40|$|<b>Beach</b> <b>pea</b> (Lathyrus maritimus (L.) Bigelow) is a {{lush green}} legume which grows along {{the shores of}} the island of Newfoundland. It is a {{circumpolar}} plant found on both sea shores and the shores of freshwater lakes. <b>Beach</b> <b>pea</b> is a fleshy perennial with an extensive rhizome system. The roots form nodules that contain bacteria (Rhizobium sp.) which provide fixed nitrogen to the legume for incorporation into proteins of the host plant. <b>Beach</b> <b>pea</b> form large persistent stands on beaches and has been studied for its potential as an alternate forage crop. The plants that grow on salt water beaches are exposed to salt water spray inferring some level of salt tolerance in the plant. The objectives of the thesis were to compare salinity effects on <b>beach</b> <b>pea</b> germination relative to other forage crops and to study salinity effects on growth. [...] Slightly increased salt concentration delayed <b>beach</b> <b>pea</b> germination more so than that of alfalfa and red clover, contrary to the initial hypothesis that <b>beach</b> <b>pea</b> germination would show higher tolerance for saline environments. Red clover and alfalfa were affected only at salt concentrations of 1. 75 and 2. 0 percent whereas <b>beach</b> <b>pea</b> germination was affected at 0. 50 percent salinity. Final germination percentage relative to germinating salinity followed a sigmoidal pattern in all crops, dropping rapidly around 1. 0 percent NaCI. Growth in saline environment effectively stopped the growth of <b>beach</b> <b>pea</b> by limiting stem elongation, new stem initiation, and new leaf initiation. Alfalfa mortality was observed {{as a result of the}} saline environment with a 50 percent mortality in the 2 percent saline environment 10 weeks after planting and 100 percent at 15 weeks. The 1 percent saline environment also increased mortality in the alfalfa to 60 percent by week 16. Control plants showed no mortality over the 16 week experiment. [...] The delay of germination and inhibition of new growth seen in the <b>beach</b> <b>pea</b> did not support the hypothesis of the experiment. Salinity measurements of the natural beach environment showed low soil salinity level relative to salinity in the tide line. At the high tide line salinity was 20 times higher than the salinity in the <b>beach</b> <b>pea</b> stands. The experiments show that the environment in which <b>beach</b> <b>pea</b> grows is not saline. Salinity delays germination but the plants, once established, are salt tolerant. In a natural stand of <b>beach</b> <b>pea</b> exposure to a saline environment would be temporary as fresh water from rain or seeps would remove the salt before any accumulation and thus plant damage could occur...|$|E

This was confirmed by quantitative data that starch content of nodules increased during the summer and decreased during the winter. Soluble sugars and non-reducing sugars increased in the winter, whereas reducing sugars increased in the fall. These results indicate that perennial nodules act as temporary storage organs. Nodules have large amounts of storage organelles such as oleosomes and amyloplasts during pre-winter months.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Biology, 2014 Premise of research. Climate {{change may}} alter {{the timing of}} {{flowering}} and pollinator activity to differing degrees, resulting in phenological mismatches between mutualist partners. Assessing the potential for such mismatches requires {{an understanding of the}} environmental factors that cue flowering and pollinator activity. Methodology. I characterized the current phenological overlap of the silky <b>beach</b> <b>pea</b> (Lathyrus littoralis [Fabaceae]) and one of its main pollinators, the solitary ground-nesting silver bee (Habropoda miserabilis [Apidae]), in coastal northwestern California. I then examined associations of abiotic variables in the environment with the spatial variation observed in the phenology of the two species. Based on the relationship of phenology dates with temperature accumulation, I projected changes in phenological overlap with climate warming. Bagging experiments and field observations were used to examine the mutual dependence of the <b>beach</b> <b>pea</b> and silver bee at my study sites. To my knowledge, this study presents the first attempt to characterize the phenology cuing of a solitary ground-nesting bee under field conditions. Pivotal results. Degree-days above freezing best predicted flowering and bee activity, although an interaction of temperature with moisture influenced the onset of flowering as well. Projections based on climate warming predictions suggest that bee emergence will advance more rapidly than flowering with temperature increases, resulting in a decrease in phenological overlap. However, start and peak dates are expected to shift differently in both species. Peak flowering and nesting were separated by an average of 2 days in 2013, but this value varied from 1 to 9 days, depending on study site. The highest projected increase in global temperatures {{by the end of the}} century (5. 8 ??C) would increase the average asynchrony of peak phenology to 7 days. Start dates were more variable across sites, and the onset of bee activity and flowering were separated by an average of 6 days in 2013. Start date asynchrony is projected to increase to an average of 17 days with an increase of 5. 8 ??C. Conclusions. The potential impacts of an increasing phenological mismatch between the <b>beach</b> <b>pea</b> and silver bee are difficult to assess, but the consequences to these species are likely to be modest. Overlap in flowering and bee activity is likely to remain high in spite of shifts in the timing of activity. Furthermore, both species are generalists and are able to use resources from other members of the local community. Concern about the mismatch of these species should be focused on the beginning of the season, as start date asynchrony is likely to increase the most by climate warming. Pattern of shift in these species gives us insight into how pollination mutualisms in the coastal dune systems may be affected in the future. In addition, as many solitary ground nesting bee species are difficult to study at the nest site, this study may give insight into the factors that cue phenology for other similar species...|$|E
40|$|Fine-scale spatial {{variation}} in genetic relatedness and inbreeding occur across continuous distributions of several populations of vertebrates; however, {{the basis of}} observed variation is often left untested. Here we test the hypothesis that prior observations of spatial patterns in genetics for an island population of feral horses (Sable Island, Canada) {{were the result of}} spatial {{variation in}} population dynamics, itself based in spatial heterogeneity in underlying habitat quality. In order to assess how genetic and population structuring related to habitat, we used hierarchical cluster analysis of water sources and an indicator analysis of the availability of important forage species to identify a longitudinal gradient in habitat quality along the length of Sable Island. We quantify a west-east gradient in access to fresh water and availability of two important food species to horses: sandwort, Honckenya peploides, and <b>beach</b> <b>pea,</b> Lathyrus japonicas. Accordingly, the population clusters into three groups that occupy different island segments (west, central, and east) that vary markedly in their local dynamics. Density, body condition, and survival and reproduction of adult females were highest in the west, followed by central and east areas. These results mirror a previous analysis of genetics, which showed that inbreeding levels are highest in the west (with outbreeding in the east), and that there are significant differences in fixation indices among groups of horses along the length of Sable Island. Our results suggest that inbreeding depression is not an important limiting factor to the horse population. We conclude that where habitat gradients exist, we can anticipate fine-scale heterogeneity i...|$|E
