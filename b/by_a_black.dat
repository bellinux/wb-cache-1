5|$|A tidal {{disruption}} {{event of}} this sort is when a star interacts with a supermassive black hole shredding the star, {{and in some cases}} creating a relativistic jet which produces bright emission of gamma ray radiation. The event GRB 110328A (also denoted Swift J1644+57) was initially argued to be produced by the disruption of a main sequence star <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hole of several million times the mass of the Sun, although it has subsequently been argued that the disruption of a white dwarf <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hole of mass about 10 thousand times the Sun may be more likely.|$|E

5|$|After {{a lengthy}} time, {{it seems as}} if the dog is cured, in that he is now {{friendly}} towards Keys. Julie confronts the dog's original owner, who has come to claim him, and who presumably trained him to attack black people. She angrily tells him in front of his grandchildren, who only know the dog as a loving family pet, that the dog has been cured <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> man.|$|E

5|$|The most {{luminous}} supernova {{ever recorded}} is ASASSN-15lh. It was first detected in June 2015 and peaked at , which is twice the bolometric luminosity {{of any other}} known supernova. However, {{the nature of this}} supernova continues to be debated and several alternative explanations have been suggested. e.g. the tidal disruption of a star <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hole.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the staff}} of The Political Cesspool {{organized}} a rally at the Tennessee area known as Confederate Park, which, along with two other Confederacy-themed parks in downtown Memphis, {{has been the subject}} of a longtime controversy for honoring Confederate soldiers and ideals. The park had been criticized earlier <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> Shelby County official, which attracted the notice of New York-based activist Al Sharpton, who was invited by the Reverend LaSimba Gray to hold a demonstration in Memphis. Sharpton planned a march called the Rally for Dignity from downtown Memphis to another park honoring Confederate Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest who was involved early in the organization of the Ku Klux Klan. Sharpton canceled the march after Edwards and The Political Cesspool staff obtained a permit to demonstrate in Confederate Park, located along Sharpton's planned march route.|$|E
5|$|In Two Grey Hills, New Mexico, Albert Hosteen (Floyd Red Crow Westerman) and {{his family}} are beaten by the Men in Black as they search for the {{whereabouts}} of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is pursued <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> helicopter before soldiers retrieve her printed copies of Albert's translations of the digital tape. Scully denies having the original tape, saying it is in Mulder's possession. Upon returning to Washington, the FBI puts Scully on mandatory leave and forces her to turn in her badge and gun. Upon entering Mulder's office, she finds the tape missing.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 7 mm. The forewings are cream-white, with <b>a</b> small <b>black</b> costal {{spot at the}} base, <b>a</b> broad <b>black</b> transverse fascia before the middle, slightly attenuated at its centre, and <b>a</b> triangular <b>black</b> costal spot halfway between the fascia and the apex, this is preceded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> small <b>black</b> spot on the dorsum and followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> few <b>black</b> scales on the termen below the apex.

5|$|In another case, 28-year-old British student Nathan Layton was bitten <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> mamba {{and died}} of a heart attack in less than an hour in March 2008. The black mamba had been found near a {{classroom}} at the Southern African Wildlife College in Hoedspruit, where Layton was training to be a safari guide. Layton was bitten by the snake on his index finger while it was being put into a jar, but he didn't realize he'd been bitten. He thought the snake had only brushed his hand. Approximately 30 minutes after being bitten Layton complained of blurred vision. He collapsed {{and died of}} a heart attack, nearly an hour after being bitten. Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at the scene.|$|E
5|$|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music {{became one}} of the best-selling albums {{recorded}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> musician of the time, as well as one of the best-selling country albums, shipping at least 500,000 copies in its first three months of release. This achievement was {{due in part to the}} mainstream promotional efforts Modern Sounds had received from ABC prior to and following release. The album proved to be a crossover hit as well, as distributors claimed the record had been selling in pop, R and country music markets; at the time, often referred to as white and black markets during the period.|$|E
5|$|Predators on the {{breeding}} grounds include feral and domestic cats, introduced American mink, feral ferrets, otters and red foxes, and birds including the common buzzard and hooded crow. In Lithuania, the introduced raccoon dog {{has also been}} recorded as taking corn crakes. When chicks are exposed by rapid mowing, they may be taken by large birds including the white stork, harriers and other birds of prey, gulls and corvids. At undisturbed sites nests and broods are rarely attacked, as reflected in a high breeding success. There is a record of a corn crake on migration through Gabon being killed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> sparrowhawk.|$|E

5|$|The 2007 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 10 June 2007 at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was {{the sixth}} {{race of the}} 2007 Formula One season. The race was won by Lewis Hamilton, {{starting}} from pole position, {{in his first season}} in the top formula. It was Hamilton's first win in Formula One and the first Formula One race won <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> driver. Nick Heidfeld finished second and Alexander Wurz was third, making it the first Grand Prix of the 2007 season that drivers from teams other than Ferrari and McLaren achieved podium positions.|$|E
5|$|The early {{light was}} {{obscured}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near {{at hand and}} the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives, the population began to call {{to each other and}} move back from the coast along the road. A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opens in}} 35,000 B.C., in {{what will become}} North Texas. Two cavemen hunters {{encounter}} a large extraterrestrial life form in a cave, which kills one and infects the other with a black oil-like substance. In 1998, in the same area, a boy falls into a hole and is also infected <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> substance which seeps from the ground. Firefighters who enter the hole to rescue him do not come out. A team of men wearing hazmat suits arrive and extract the boy's body. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, while investigating a bomb threat against a federal building in Dallas, discover the bomb in a building across the street. As the building is evacuated, Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud remains, ostensibly to disarm the bomb. However, he simply waits for the bomb to detonate.|$|E

5|$|The {{network was}} a pioneer in TV {{programming}} aimed at minority audiences and featuring minority performers, {{at a time when}} the other American networks aired few television series for non-whites. Among DuMont's minority programs were The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong, starring Asian American film actress Anna May Wong, the first US TV show to star an Asian American, and The Hazel Scott Show, starring pianist and singer Hazel Scott, the first US network TV series to be hosted <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> woman.|$|E
5|$|A {{month before}} his capture, U.S. {{authorities}} had been passing down information to {{their counterparts in}} Mexico that Treviño Morales was making frequent visits to the Nuevo Laredo border area to see his newborn baby. They got this intelligence from wiretaps, conversations, and informants' tips. Treviño Morales was apprehended by the Mexican Marines in Anáhuac, Nuevo León, near the border of Tamaulipas state, at around 3:45 a.m. on 15 July 2013 without a single shot fired. The truck he was traveling in was intercepted on the road <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Hawk helicopter from the Navy; when the Marines got off the helicopter and tried to apprehend him, the capo attempted to escape by running through some bushes but was later caught. He was in possession of US$2 million ($25,316,100 MXN) in cash, eight weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition; two other men were arrested with him and taken into custody. Rumors of Treviño Morales's arrest and a mugshot of him in custody began to circulate through Twitter and other social media outlets around noon that day, but the Mexican government did not confirm the arrest, nor did the U.S. authorities receive a formal confirmation until hours later.|$|E
5|$|For {{the sixth}} {{time in his}} major league career, Doby was named an All-Star during the 1954 season, one of five Indians named. The game was held at Cleveland's Municipal Stadium and {{featured}} the second-largest crowd to watch an All-Star Game (the largest was in 1935 at the same stadium). In what would prove his final career All-Star at bat, Doby hit a pinch-hit solo {{home run in the}} eighth inning to tie the game at 9–9; the AL squad went on to win, 11–9. His home run was the first hit <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> player in an All-Star Game. The game, which had a record 17 hits by the AL and was the highest-scoring All-Star Game until 1998, was called the best ever by All-Star Game founder Arch Ward. As the regular season resumed, Doby helped the Indians to win a franchise-record 111 games and the AL pennant. His regular season 32 home runs and career-high 126 RBIs were highest in the AL, which led to him finishing second in AL MVP voting. The Indians were swept in the 1954 World Series by Doby's former Eagles teammate Monte Irvin and the New York Giants.|$|E

5|$|In {{its second}} week, the album {{remained}} at number one, selling an additional 374,000 copies. Ten days after its release, Beyoncé had sold 991,000 copies in the US, {{making it the}} best-selling album by a female artist in 2013. A third week at number-one with sales of 310,000 copies brought the album's US sales to 1.3million after 17 days of release, positioning it as the eighth best-selling album of the year, {{and the first to}} enter the year-end top 10 based on just three weeks of sales availability in the Nielsen SoundScan era. In its fourth week, sales reached 1.43million, surpassing the total sales of Beyoncé's previous album, 4, which was released in 2011 and had sold 1.39million in total {{in the two years since}} its release. Following Beyoncé performing at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, sales of the album in the US increased by 181%. The record sold 878,000 copies in the US in 2014 alone, becoming the sixth best-selling album of the year. As of November 2016, Beyoncé has sold 2.4million copies in the US and has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In July 2017, the album became the longest-charting album <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> female artist in Billboard 200 history, surpassing the record previously held by Whitney Houston’s self-titled album.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few days PATU and RLI patrols arrested five insurgents, two of whom were deserters. One of these {{defected}} and agreed to guide the security forces to the ZIPRA base camp, where he said there were two guerrillas waiting for him to return, unaware of his desertion and subsequent defection. Shown the way by the ex-cadre an RLI patrol attacked the camp on 24 January and killed one of the two; the other fled and was captured a few days later. The members of Gang 1 were now all killed or captured while only one was outstanding from Gang 2. Gangs 3 and 4 were revealed to be near Sipolilo on 21 January <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> shopkeeper, and two Gang 3 members were encountered by Henson's troop on 24 January. Henson himself opened fire and killed one, who it emerged was the Gang 3 commander. His troop then followed about 10 men until 26 January, when they lost the insurgents' tracks.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the massacre, {{the town}} of Rosewood had been a quiet, {{primarily}} black, self-sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black Rosewood resident because of unsupported accusations that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been beaten and possibly raped <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> drifter. When the town's black citizens rallied together to defend themselves against further attacks, a mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for black people, and burned almost every structure in Rosewood. Survivors from the town hid for several days in nearby swamps until they were evacuated by train and car to larger towns. Although state and local authorities {{were aware of the}} violence, no arrests were made for what happened in Rosewood. The town was abandoned by its former black residents; none ever moved back.|$|E
