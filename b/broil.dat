Filipinos reached Hawaii in 1909, bringing peas and beans, the adobo style of vinegar and garlic dishes, choosing to boil, stew, <b>broil,</b> and fry food instead of baking, and eating sweet potatoes as a staple instead of rice. Samoans arrived in 1919, building their earth ovens above ground instead of below like the imu, and made poi from fruit instead of taro. After the Vietnam War ended in 1975 immigrants from Southeast Asia arrived, bringing lemongrass, fish sauce and galangal popular in Thai and Vietnamese cuisine.|$|E
25|$|Assaliaq (assaliq; lit. «fried thing»; also, pancake; other fried food; fry bread) {{is fresh}} fried fish. All {{parts of the}} fish except the {{entrails}} are used to prepare this dish, although often the heads are removed as well. The fish is filleted, dipped in seasoned flour, or just seasoned with salt, and fried in oil. If households enjoy picking and sucking backbones or only a few fish are available, the backbone will be fried along with the filleted pieces. Heads are sometimes fried for the same reasons. Boiled rice is the favorite side dish with this meal. Middle aged and younger people enjoy this meal for the flavor. The verb assali- (to fry; to make pancakes or griddlecakes) is derived from Russian жа́рить (zhárit’) ‘to roast, fry, <b>broil,</b> grill’.|$|E

I asked for <b>broiled</b> chicken, and I was told by the waiter and later by the dining-car conductor that there was no <b>broiled</b> chicken. There must have been an argument, for the Pullman conductor came in and remarked: [...] "If he wants <b>broiled</b> chicken, give it to him. If you haven't got it on the train, stop somewhere.

40|$|<b>Broiling</b> {{is cooking}} tender {{cuts of meat}} by radiant heat from hot coals, a gas flame, or an {{electric}} element. Steaks and chops for <b>broiling</b> are from 1 to 2 inches thick. <b>Broiling</b> {{as a method of}} cooking mat is not new, but the directions for the process are the result of individual trial and error testing and are often in conflict. Current interest in indoor and outdoor <b>broiling,</b> particularly in Western United States, emphasizes the need for better information. There is no measuring device for surface heat during <b>broiling</b> and thus little research on the relationship of surface temperature, degree of doneness and cooking time. Little has been done to investigate the effect of a change in rate of heat transfer on the physical and chemical reactions which occur during <b>broiling.</b> Although some work has been done on the effects of different cooking methods on weight losses, tenderness, palatability, and thiamine content of beef, no reports were found relating cut of meat, temperature at the surface of the mat, and degree of doneness to other factors during <b>broiling.</b> The existing literature contained relatively little information on changes produced in <b>broiled</b> beef. Most of the data available were indefinite, lacking precise information regarding time and temperature. Timetables for <b>broiling,</b> like roasting, varied in directions given and frequently stated the time of cooking in minutes per pound. At best this can serve only as a poor guide because the amount of fat and bone present, the state of the meat, whether solid or ground, the amount of connective tissue present, and the thickness of the meat influence the rate of heat penetration. This initial study was conducted on beef using charcoal as the source of heat, since the heat of the charcoal could be controlled at different temperatures. A high, medium and low temperature were used for cooking and the meat was cooked to three degrees of doneness (rare, medium and well-done). In this research a potentiometer devised by Taylor Instrument Company to measure the temperature at the surfaces of the meat and internally was used. Thus it was possible to accurately measure the temperature. An experimental model of a coil-type thermometer was also made by Taylor Instrument Company and its use offered, for the first time, the possibility of determining the temperature at the surface of the meat. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationship of surface temperature during <b>broiling</b> to stage of doneness and to cooking time on the following factors in <b>broiled</b> sirloin steaks: thiamine retention, soluble protein content, weight loss, moisture retention, changes in tenderness, juiciness and flavor. It was hoped that the findings might be of use in the development of a thermometer to be used for <b>broiling</b> much as oven and meat thermometers are used now for roasting meats. Also, an attempt was made to develop time-temperature charts for use in <b>broiling...</b>|$|R

40|$|Charcoal <b>broiling</b> is {{becoming}} an increasingly popular method for cooking meat. Little scientific {{work has been done}} in this area. Information presently available on charcoal <b>broiling</b> consists of broad generalizations which have developed from trial and error testing. With the current interest in charcoal <b>broiling,</b> {{there is a need for}} more factual, scientific information as to the proper procedure. Cooking method affects palatability and nutritive value of meat. Chemical and physical changes occur during the cooking process and the reactions which take place are not fully known or understood. Each cooking method has a specific effect upon meat due to the rate of heat penetration and the reactions which take place during the cooking period. <b>Broiling</b> usually takes place at high temperature, making this method of cooking meat contrary to recommendations. Generally <b>broiling</b> is done with the thermostat set at 500 F. The heating element is constantly energized when turned on. Attempts are made to adjust to the desired temperature by varying the distance from the heat source. Cover et al. (1957) showed actual surface temperature of the broiler often fluctuated from the desired temperature. Preliminary testing in our laboratory showed that it was impossible to regulate heat at a constant temperature with an electric broiler...|$|R
