50|$|During the First World War Algoma made steel for {{artillery}} shells {{but after the}} war continued to rely on rail production. The necessity of importing ore and coal from the United States due to the low quality of Canadian iron ore, {{as well as the}} absentee owners' greater interest in annual dividends than building a viable industrial complex, held back Algoma during the 1920s. At the height of the Great Depression, the company was insolvent and in receivership until Sir James Dunn gained control in 1935 and restored it to profitability. Dunn's policy of never paying a dividend to stockholders, coupled with extensive modernization and expansion during the Second World War, and an extended period of steel demand up until the mid-1950s, allowed Algoma to expand and become a more <b>balanced</b> <b>steel</b> producer.|$|E
40|$|Compared {{with normal}} concrete, {{high-strength}} concrete has higher strength but is generally more brittle. Its {{use in a}} reinforced concrete structure, if not properly controlled, could lead to an unsustainable reduction in ductility. However, confinement could be provided to improve the ductility of the structure. In this study, the effects of concrete strength and confinement on the flexural ductility of reinforced concrete beams have been evaluated by means of complete moment-curvature analysis of beam sections cast in different concretes and provided with different confinements. The results reveal {{that the use of}} high-strength concrete at a constant tension steel ratio would increase the flexural ductility, but at a constant tension to <b>balanced</b> <b>steel</b> ratio would decrease the flexural ductility. In contrast, the provision of confinement would always increase the flexural ductility. It does this in two ways: first, it increases the <b>balanced</b> <b>steel</b> ratio so that, at the same tension steel ratio, the tension to <b>balanced</b> <b>steel</b> ratio is decreased; and second, it increases the residual strength and ductility of the concrete so that, at the same tension to <b>balanced</b> <b>steel</b> ratio, the flexural ductility of the beam section is increased. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} singly {{reinforced}} concrete beams made of normal- and high-strength concretes were tested under monotonically increasing loads to study their flexural behaviour and {{to compare the}} flexural ductility of normal- and high-strength concrete beams. The flexural strength results verified that British Standard BS 8110, after modification as per the recommendation of The Concrete Society Technical Report 49, is reasonably accurate for application to high-strength concrete beams. On the other hand, the flexural ductility results revealed that the major structural parameters determining the ductility of singly reinforced beams are: (1) for given materials, the tension steel ratio; and (2) in more general cases, the tension steel to <b>balanced</b> <b>steel</b> ratio and the concrete grade. Based on the available test results, a simple formula for predicting the ductility of normal-and high-strength concrete beams is developed. Lastly, {{in order to avoid}} brittle failure, it is proposed to set a maximum limit to the tension steel to <b>balanced</b> <b>steel</b> ratio, whose values at different concrete strengths are given in the paper. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|High- and normal-strength {{concretes}} {{have different}} stress-strain characteristics and therefore high-strength concrete beams {{should not be}} designed {{in the same way}} as normal-strength concrete beams. In this study, the non-linear flexural behaviour of high-strength concrete beams has been analysed and compared to that of normal-strength concrete beams. It was revealed that because of the gradual change in stress-strain characteristics of the concrete, the ultimate concrete strain varies significantly with the concrete grade. Moreover, the tension reinforcement does not always yield at the point of peak moment and thus the maximum compressive strain of the concrete when the tension reinforcement yields, which is needed for evaluation of the <b>balanced</b> <b>steel</b> ratio, is not the same as the ultimate concrete strain. Nevertheless, compromised values of ultimate concrete strain that can be used for evaluation of both flexural strength and <b>balanced</b> <b>steel</b> ratio without producing significant errors have been derived. Lastly, the existing concrete stress-strain curve given in the British Standard BS 8110 for beam design has been reviewed and modification to cater for high-strength concrete proposed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|High-strength {{concrete}} {{is relatively}} brittle {{and its use}} in a reinforced concrete member might result in unacceptably low flexural ductility. One way of improving ductility is to provide confinement. However, {{in the case of}} beam design the effects of confinement are generally not considered due mainly to the lack of a suitable design method. In order to develop a design method for improving the flexural ductility of high-strength concrete members through the provision of confinement, the effects of confinement on the flexural behaviour of reinforced concrete beams have been evaluated in this study by complete moment-curvature analysis of beam sections with and without confinement provided. It was found that the provision of confinement significantly increases the ultimate concrete strain, <b>balanced</b> <b>steel</b> ratio and flexural ductility. Furthermore, design formulae for the flexural strength and ductility design of high-strength concrete beams with the effects of confinement taken into account have been developed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Ferdinand Berthoud found in 1773 that an ordinary brass <b>balance</b> and <b>steel</b> hairspring, subjected to a 60 °F (33 °C) temperature increase, loses 393 seconds (6 1/2 minutes) per day, of which 312 seconds is due to spring elasticity decrease.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{high-strength}} concrete (HSC) {{can reduce}} the size of columns in tall buildings and save space. However, this will also reduce the flexural ductility of the columns. To restore the flexural ductility after using HSC, additional confinement has been recommended. In this paper, the effect of adding confinement on the flexural ductility of HSC columns is studied by nonlinear moment-curvature analysis taking into account the stress-path dependence of the steel reinforcement. The analytical results reveal that the addition of confinement would enhance the flexural ductility of columns by increasing the <b>balanced</b> <b>steel</b> ratio and balanced axial load level. However, the effectiveness of adding confinement to improve the flexural ductility of columns decreases as the axial load level or concrete strength increases. Finally, {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} adding confinement, two previously derived formulas correlating the flexural ductility to various structural parameters are extended to incorporate the effect of the confining pressure. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The present work is {{an attempt}} to study the neutral axis {{variation}} and the evolution of the moment inertia with the loading of over reinforced high strength concrete sections in conjunction with ACI 318 - 05. In this sense, four high strength concrete beams, having different tension reinforcement quantities expressed as proportions of the <b>balanced</b> <b>steel</b> ratio (0. 75 Ï� b, 0. 85 Ï� b, Ï� b, 1. 2 Ï� b) were tested. Measurements of the deflection and the reinforcement and concrete strains of all specimens were made during the loading process. The load-neutral axis depth variation and the load-section stiffness curves were drawn. The slope of the line connecting the origin of the first crack to the initial yielding of the failure point in the neutral axis depth-load graphs shows the rate of ductility; ductile behaviour in the beam increases as the slope becomes steeper. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that the modulus of elasticity of concrete E c be reviewed and evaluated at a stress higher than 0. 5 fâ�² c for the determination of the cracked moment of inertia...|$|E

5000|$|Wasters are {{not without}} their faults. The all wooden {{construction}} usually makes wasters somewhat lighter and differently <b>balanced</b> than <b>steel</b> weapons.

Steel weapons do not display this attribute to the same extent, usually binding and sliding with minimal rebound instead.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide and verify a new design method for the in-plane compressive strength of steel sandwich panels comprised of steel face sheets and foamed steel cores. Foamed steel, literally steel with internal voids, provides enhanced bending rigidity, exceptional energy dissipation, and the potential to mitigate local instability. In this work, Winter’s effective width expression is generalized to the case of steel foam sandwich panels. The generalization requires modification of the elastic buckling expressions to account for panel non-composite bending rigidity and shear deformations. In addition, an equivalent yield stress is introduced to provide a single parameter description of the yielding behavior of the steel face sheets and steel foam core. The provided analytical expressions are verified with finite element simulations employing three-dimensional continuum elements and calibrated constitutive models specific to metallic foams. The developed closed-form design expressions are employed to conduct parametric studies of steel foam sandwich panels, which (a) demonstrate the significant strength improvements possible when compared with solid steel, and (b) provide insights on the optimal <b>balance</b> between <b>steel</b> face sheet thickness and density of the foamed steel core.
