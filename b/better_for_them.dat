5|$|To {{achieve that}} result, Varrick takes care {{to prevent the}} case from going to Florida, Alisandros' {{favorite}} battleground. It is much <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to let jurisdiction be claimed by Chicago federal judge Harry Seawright, with whom Rogan Rothberg has some ties. A bonus from Varrick's {{point of view is}} the fact that the Chicago tort lawsuit was filed by such a minor and inexperienced firm as Finley & Figg; it is confidently assumed that Karros would make short work of them in court. The case is soon expedited on Seawright's docket with Finley & Figg's claim singled out of the tort claimants and Karros takes action to have Finley & Figg's eight death cases heard separately. The specific case singled out to serve as the test case is one in which Finley & Figg represents the widow of a man who died after taking Krayoxx but he was also taking prior to his death a mixture of some ten other drugs, so that it is virtually impossible to pinpoint the effect of Krayoxx.|$|E

25|$|The centre then {{realized}} that it was <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to deal with a more competent agent, which at the time was Babrak Karmal, who later accused Nur Muhammad Taraki of taking bribes and even having secretly contacted the United States embassy in Kabul. On that, the centre again refused to listen and instructed him to take resident position in the Kabul residency by 1974. On 30 April 1978, Taraki, despite being cut off from any support, led the coup which later became known as April Revolution, and became the country's President, along with Hafizullah Amin being Deputy-Prime Minister and Vice-President. On 5 December of that same year, Taraki compared the April Revolt to the Russian Revolution, which struck Vladimir Kryuchkov, the FCD chief of that time.|$|E

25|$|When their truck {{broke down}} in Mendota, CA, Grandmother Rita {{decided that it was}} <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to stay in the valley where there was always work instead of {{returning}} to Anaheim like they originally planned. After floods destroyed their camp in Mendota, they moved south to Weedpatch, CA and took up residence in an abandoned granary. The family was still poor, and they pulled mustard greens and wild mushrooms from ditch banks for food and drank potentially dangerous and contaminated water collected in large barrels infested with bugs. At school one day Lopez began displaying signs of illness and was kept in the basement {{for the remainder of the}} day; it was Typhoid Fever most likely contracted from the contaminated water and she was kept in isolation at a Bakersfield hospital until overcoming the illness. From 1933-1936 Her family continued to migrate up and down the Valley for work, including back breaking labor such as picking onions using a short-handled hoe.|$|E
25|$|Things couldn't {{have gone}} any <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> when the first, {{second and third}} teams all won their {{respective}} leagues in what proved {{to be one of}} the most successful seasons in the club's history. The 1st XI held on to top spot in Division Two from June onwards with Stenhouse instrumental with the ball again as he took 70 wickets, a feat which saw him later named the Liverpool Comp Bowler of the Year. However it was his batting that clinched the title as his unbeaten half century helped Park beat Burscough on the final day of the season. The 2nd XI also strolled to their second consecutive title victory while the 3rd XI finally ended their 50-year hunt for trophy success as they won their league under former first team captain Ken Crofton. The Under 20s also performed well making it to the final of the Liverpool Comp Under 20 Knockout Cup only to lose a close game to Rainhill.|$|E

Cornwallis' quartermaster general, William Erskine, urged Cornwallis to strike right away, saying [...] "If Washington is the General I take him to be, his army will not be found there in the morning." [...] But James Grant disagreed, and argued that there was no way for the Americans to retreat, and that the British troops were worn out, and that it would be <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to attack in the morning after they had rested. Cornwallis did not want to wait until morning, but he decided that it would be better than sending his troops out to attack in the dark. Cornwallis said, [...] "We've got the old fox safe now. We'll go over and bag him in the morning." [...] Cornwallis then moved his army to a hill north of Trenton for the night.|$|E

500|$|Gilmore {{participated in}} his second debate on May 15 in South Carolina {{broadcast}} by Fox News. His first question concerned the perceived growing threat of a nuclear armed Iran. Gilmore thanked the questioner {{on the basis that}} he believed the [...] "Middle East issue" [...] should be looked at beyond Iraq. He stated that as president he would join with American allies to put [...] "serious mandatory sanctions" [...] on the regime to let them know [...] "that it is <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to give up this sort of plan (Nuclear proliferation)." [...] After receiving a question about Social Security, Gilmore changed the subject to address his record of cutting taxes as Governor of Virginia. He would later attack fellow candidates: Rudy Giuliani for his pro-choice positions, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee for his record on taxes, and Mitt Romney for his position on health care. When asked about potential terrorist attacks, Gilmore reminded the audience that he was governor when The Pentagon was attacked on 9/11 and that he has [...] "the experience to deal with these issues." [...] At the end of the debate, Gilmore addressed the issue of race when asked why no minorities where present on the stage running for the presidency, he reacted to this question by declaring that the Republican Party has [...] "people that are prepared to [...] in the immediate future". He also cited his own credentials on race stating that as attorney general of Virginia he faced the issue when he {{had to deal with the}} burning of African-American churches, which gave him a good standing with the African-American community in his own judgment.|$|E

2500|$|After {{returning}} from the concentration camps, many Jews realized they have been dispropertied by the new Communist government.

Some of the Jews who opposed this policy, were told [...] "they are welcome to leave at any time".

2500|$|..[...] I {{have read}} some history, and I find that several {{countries}} have {{from time to}} time been afflicted with the same land disease as that under which Ireland is now labouring, and although the political doctors applied many remedies, the one that proved effectual was the tearing out, root and branch, of the class that caused the disease. All right-thinking men would deplore the necessity of having recourse in this country to scenes such as have been enacted in other lands, although I for one will not hold up my hands in holy horror at a movement that gave liberty not only to France but to Europe. If excesses were at that time committed, they must be measured by the depth of slavery and ignorance in which the people had been kept, and I trust Irish landlords will in time recognise {{the fact that it is}} <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> at least to have this land question settled after the manner of a Stein or a Hardenberg than wait for the excesses of a Marat or a Robespierre.|$|E

[...] To Kenneth Day he wrote: [...] "It would be <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> {{to hear it from}} you than from me." [...] The Dean's letters about students who had committed no overt act explained the circumstances at length and provided he Court's rationale for expulsion in such cases: [...] "The acts in question are so unspeakably gross that the intimates of those who commit these acts become tainted." [...] He made a clear distinction by not criticizing such a student's character, but his judgment, calling him [...] "no worse than ignorant, over-curious, and careless." [...] When it came to those who had engaged in homosexual sex, Greenough withheld details yet tried to underscore the significance of the violation. To Roberts' father, Greenough wrote that his son [...] "has promised to tell you all about the matter, and I hope he will tell you the whole truth. His offense {{has nothing to do with}} low scholarship; it is not gambling, or drink or ordinary sexual intercourse. If he does not confess to something worse than these things, he will not have told you the whole story." ...|$|E
