Through {{the course of}} my study in the MA program I discovered that the answer to this, like the paintings themselves, lies within me. By exploring what it is to paint from life and the natural world, I was able to develop technical skills. As I progressed I used these skills to express a personal narrative, combining images from memory and photographs. It surprised me to discover that my real interest lies in the narrative of process, the revealing of my thoughts through the act of painting itself. I paint not to express <b>what</b> <b>I</b> see with my eyes, but to make the intangible into something real. Paintings which evolve from a subjective awareness <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it feels like to live in this world have meaning not <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they stand for, but <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they reveal. <b>I</b> paint in order to see myself, to make visible that which lies beneath the surface and to offer up a glimpse for others.

40|$|The {{idea for}} this story come from a true {{incident}} that I once experienced with a friend. Our high school group traveled to Europe, with Paris {{as one of its}} destinations. We spent one day at the Louvre, exploring on our own. My friend Krista and I noticed it was time to go, but we could not find our way back to where we were supposed to meet. It took us a while and when we got back our group hod already gone. We were left by ourselves, not knowing what to do. After a run-in with the guards, our group eventually came back for us. I will always remember this experience in my life, and the things that went along with it. The rooms of the Louvre are so vivid in my mind because I went through them so many times, looking for a way back. It is partly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> this experience that I remember the trip so vividly. In writing this book, I wanted to help the reader relate more to the art and to the museum <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happens <b>i</b> n the story. The story is about a ten-year-old girl named Sophie who travels to the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. She goes with her teacher, Miss May, and her classmates. Sophie is so excited about experiencing the art that she unknowingly follows the wrong group. She gets lost and must ask someone for help. With the help of Luc, who works in the museum, Sophie finds her teacher and learns a lot in the process. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R

She grieved to think that, having entombed her in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, I would quit forever its happy recesses, transferring the love which now was so passionately her own to some maiden of the outer and everyday world. And, then and there, I threw myself hurriedly at the feet of Eleonora, and offered up a vow, to herself and to Heaven, that I would never bind myself in marriage to any daughter of Earth--that I would in no manner prove recreant to her dear memory, or to the memory of the devout affection with which she had blessed me. And I called the Mighty Ruler of the Universe to witness the pious solemnity of my vow. And the curse which I invoked of Him and of her, a saint in Helusion should I prove traitorous to that promise, involved a penalty the exceeding great horror of which will not permit me to make record of it here. And the bright eyes of Eleonora grew brighter at my words; and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been taken from her breast; and she trembled and very bitterly wept; but she made acceptance of the vow, (for what was she but a child?) and it made easy to her the bed of her death.

40|$|The article {{addresses}} cultural {{memory in}} the Netherlands and Indonesia about mass violence committed during Dutch colonialism {{in the nineteenth}} and twentieth century. In both cases it questions the conception, expressed by various observers of both countries, that colonial violence has been forgotten {{in the sense that}} there are no traces of it left in the public sphere.

Using Ann Laura Stoler's notion of ‘cultural aphasia’, which indicates a lack of language in a culture to address certain issues, I argue that traces of colonial violence are widely present in the Netherlands, but that there is a difficulty to give them a meaning within a national framework. With this analysis, I depart from an intentionalist perspective on cultural memory in which there are specific groups in society that through conspiracies create a cover-up of colonialism, and I want to show that in fact the victims of Dutch colonialism are not memorable within the mnemonic community <b>of</b> the Netherlands <b>because</b> dominant discourses do not produce them as belonging to Dutch national history.

Neither the business disputes of contract law nor the physical injuries described in a torts casebook can compare with the depravity <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we teach in criminal law. Criminal law professors are often addicted to their subject. Nothing else matches its intensity and despair; by comparison, teaching a private law course can seem unreal to the criminal law junkie. Although we often hate the material <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it represents, <b>I</b> do not know a single teacher of criminal law who is ambivalent about the subject. Teaching criminal law inspires a level of intellectual commitment bordering on obsession. Criminal law professors are equally passionate about their teaching material. They {{use a variety of}} different styles in the classroom, and what works for one professor and his or her students may not necessarily work for another. This is not an indictment of any casebook, but simply a logical implication of pedagogical pluralism. There are multiple avenues for developing a rich and profound understanding of the criminal law, and it is unclear whether the current offerings in the field respond adequately to the needs of every professor. The question then arises whether there is room {{in the market for a}} new casebook that structures the learning materials in a new way. In the following Review, I analyze the leading criminal law casebooks on the market and describe the ways in which they do—and do not—respond to the needs of criminal law teachers. At least part of the issue is the changing nature of law teaching—what actually happens in the classroom has changed in the last three decades. Moreover, there may be less uniformity in classroom practice than in the past; in other words, what works in one law school might not work in another, due in part to the changing profile of law students, as well as the great diversity of intellectual perspectives that law teachers bring to the lectern. I then lay out a vision for a new casebook in criminal law that responds to some of these desiderata with a fresh yet flexible approach...|$|R
