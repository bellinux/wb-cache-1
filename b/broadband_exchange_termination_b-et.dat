BETEUS is a project which is aiming at providing a platform for the support of tele-teaching applications.

The realization of the communication platform is constrained by the services available on the European ATM pilot. Since signalling and multicast features have not been available, the BETEUS communication platform implements a pragmatic approach to overcome these shortcomings. Firstly, we utilize a fully-meshed network for connecting BETEUS sites. Secondly, multicast is done in the application itself. As services, both end-toend native ATM and IP connectivity are provided. The BETEUS communication platform complies with certain important application requirements such as throughput and end-to-end delay.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} the communication platform that was implemented for the European BETEUS (<b>Broadband</b> <b>Exchange</b> for Trans-European Usage) project. The BETEUS communication platform supports the fast implementation of networked multimedia applications with conference character and CSCW (Computer Supported Collaborative Work) features. The platform exhibits {{the notion of}} a site as one of its main abstractions. A site is a collection of workstations, media input and output devices and switching devices that are, in terms of control, tightly coupled. The available equipment within a site is logically mapped onto nodes, where the definition of a node is application dependent. Connection control in a site is centralized within a connection management entity. A site management entity residing on top of the connection management provides high level connection and session abstractions to applications. Applications can run within a site as well as span multiple sites, in which case application and connection control is distributed among the involved sites. So far, two applications have been implemented on top of the platform: a telemeeting application and a tele-tutoring application. The ease with which these applications could be implemented justifies the extra-effort that went into the development of a platform. ...|$|R
40|$|Multimedia is an {{important}} issue that drives the request for ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) communication. The usage of multimedia features in a collaborative work environment is the core of BETEUS- <b>Broadband</b> <b>Exchange</b> for Trans-European USage. In this paper we discuss the design and implementation of the BETEUS communication platform. BETEUS is a european project funded by the EC which is aiming at providing a platform for the support of CSCW applications such as tele-teaching, tele-meeting or tele-seminar. The communication platform is the part of the overall BETEUS platform that provides end-to-end connectivity between BETEUS sites. The realization of the communication platform is constrained by the services available on the European ATM pilot. The development of the BETEUS application platform is independent from the actual support of the underlying communication infrastructure. Although all BETEUS user sites run FORE ATM 200 switches, this was not obvious when the design of the communication platform was started. But, at that time, it was apparent that IP connectivity was available for all partners either directly over ATM or SMDS (Switched Multimegabit Data Service). The communication platform can be extended so that IP multicast facilities can be used for point-to-multipoint communication as is requested by teleteaching applications. The paper discusses the services offered by the European ATM pilot. Since the BETEUS communication platform is designed to provide reliable connectivity between BETEUS user sites, sites are connected by a fully meshed network using ATM VPs (Virtual Path), i. e. permanent virtual channels (PVC). PVCs are based on the semi-permanent virtual path service (Section 2. 2). Such a service has been considered most appropriate with respect to the design considerations of the BETEUS communication platform 1...|$|R

40|$|Millimeter wave (mm-Wave) {{communications}} {{has been}} considered as a strong candidate for future wireless standards, due to the large available bandwidth {{in the order of}} gigahertz. As a result, a plethora of future services and application-oriented scenarios can be conceived, under suitable propagation conditions. Accurate physical (PHY) layer design plays a vital role in the deployment of robust transmission systems able to efficiently exploit the large bandwidth portions available in the mm-Wave frequencies. In this paper, we propose Space-Time Shift Keying (STSK) MIMO coding combined with Cyclic-Prefixed Single Carrier (CP-SC) block transmission for <b>broadband</b> data <b>exchange</b> over frequency-selective mm-Wave channels. STSK allows to exploit transmit and receive diversity with better performance when compared with state-of-the-art MIMO techniques only relying on receive diversity, such as, for example Spatial Modulation (SM). The performance of CP-SC-STSK and CP-SC-SM have been assessed in the presence of phase noise and imperfect channel estimation, considering 2 and 4 elements MIMO systems and LoS indoor vs. nLoS outdoor 73 GHz multipath channels. We show that the STSK-based solution using MMSE Frequency-Domain Equalization (FDE) is very robust against the aforementioned impairments and clearly outperforms CP-SC-SM at the price of a slight increase of receiver complexity and a throughput reduction of 50 % when 4 × 4 MIMO systems are considered...|$|R
40|$|We analyze complex, multi-frequency, {{non-linear}} modal {{interactions in}} the damped dynamics of a viscously damped dispersive finite rod coupled to a multi-degree-of-freedom essentially non-linear attachment. We perform a parametric study {{to show that}} the attachment can be an effective broadband energy absorber and dissipater of shock energy from the rod. It is shown that strong targeted energy transfer from the rod to the attachment occurs when there is strong stiffness asymmetry in the attachment. For weak viscous dissipation, a clear understanding of dynamical transitions in the integrated rod-non-linear attachment system can be gained by wavelet transforming the time series and superimposing the resulting wavelet spectra in the frequency-energy plot (FEP) of the periodic orbits of the underlying Hamiltonian system. Two distinct NES configurations are analyzed in detail, and their damped responses are analyzed by the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). We show that the HHT is capable of analyzing even complex non-linear damped transitions, by providing the dominant frequency components (or equivalently, time scales) at which the non-linear phenomena take place, and clarifying the series of non-linear resonance captures between the rod and attachment dynamics that are responsible for the <b>broadband</b> energy <b>exchanges</b> in this system.

50|$|The Seattle Pilots fared {{worst of}} the four {{expansion}} franchises, playing only in the 1969 season. The team fared poorly on the field, and faced financial difficulties owing to no television coverage, a stadium with problems, and the highest ticket and concession prices in the league. Owners of other American League teams wanted Soriano and Daley to sell the team to a Seattle owner who would improve the team and address issues at Sick's Stadium, particularly uncovered seats with bad views. After several attempts to sell the team to a Seattle owner failed, on April 1, 1970 judge Sidney Volinn declared the team officially bankrupt; it was sold to Bud Selig, who moved the team to Milwaukee and renamed it the Milwaukee Brewers. Selig had negotiated a deal for the purchase with Soriano during Game 1 of the 1969 World Series. As {{a result of the}} relocation, in 1970 the city of Seattle, King County, and the state of Washington sued the American League for breach of contract.

This study reports on the reduction in the friction force of silicon surfaces after the alkali metal ion exposure in the form of aqueous solutions. A scanning force microscope equipped with a liquid cell was used to investigate the friction force and the pull-off force of a flat silicon surface immersed in water and in different alkali metal chlorides solutions: LiCl, NaCl and CsCl. The concentration ranged from 0. 1 up to 1000 µmol/l. The changes in the free surface energy of the initial surface and of the modified surfaces after drying were determined from contact angle measurements and from the acid–base adhesion theory. In both cases, in the liquid environment and after drying of the exposed silicon substrates in air, the friction force is reduced by approximately 50 %.
