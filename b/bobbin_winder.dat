25|$|It is {{impossible}} to say with any certainty how many or even which of his inventions passed into general and practical use, and thereby had impact over {{the lives of many}} people. Among those inventions that are credited with passing into general practical use are the strut bridge, the automated <b>bobbin</b> <b>winder,</b> the rolling mill, the machine for testing the tensile strength of wire and the lens-grinding machine pictured at right. In the lens-grinding machine, the hand rotation of the grinding wheel operates an angle-gear, which rotates a shaft, turning a geared dish in which sits the glass or crystal to be ground. A single action rotates both surfaces at a fixed speed ratio determined by the gear.|$|E
500|$|Leonardo is revered for his {{technological}} ingenuity. He conceptualised flying machines, {{a type of}} armoured fighting vehicle, concentrated solar power, an adding machine, and {{the double}} hull. [...] Relatively few of his designs were constructed or even feasible during his lifetime, as the modern scientific approaches to metallurgy and engineering were only in their infancy during the Renaissance. Some of his smaller inventions, however, such as an automated <b>bobbin</b> <b>winder</b> and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire, entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. A number of Leonardo's most practical inventions are nowadays displayed as working models at the Museum of Vinci. He made substantial discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, geology, optics, and hydrodynamics, {{but he did not}} publish his findings and they had no direct influence on later science.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>bobbin</b> <b>winder</b> {{is mounted}} {{high on the}} pedestal, where a small rubber tire occupying its pulley makes contact with the motor belt. [...] The new {{mounting}} position solves the <b>bobbin</b> <b>winder</b> belt problem discussed later.|$|E

2500|$|The add-on {{motor drives}} the {{handwheel}} {{by means of}} a rubber belt. [...] Meanwhile the <b>bobbin</b> <b>winder</b> has a separate belt: the models 27 and 28 drive the <b>bobbin</b> <b>winder</b> using a long round or V belt to the motor, whereas the 'modernized' models 127 and 128 drive the <b>bobbin</b> <b>winder</b> directly off the handwheel {{by means of a}} small [...] "ring belt" [...] or [...] "bobbin belt" [...] acting as a tire.|$|E
2500|$|To answer this, the modernized models 127 and 128 {{moved the}} <b>bobbin</b> <b>winder</b> up several inches where, with a {{suitable}} tire, it can run directly off the handwheel. [...] The older 27 and 28, {{on the other}} hand, require a dedicated belt to drive the <b>bobbin</b> <b>winder,</b> but the motor kit only has one pulley, resulting in problems: ...|$|E
2500|$|Models 27 and 28 were {{designed}} before electrified sewing machines were common, {{and the location}} of the <b>bobbin</b> <b>winder</b> reflects this. [...] It is positioned to intercept the treadle belt as it passes back down into the cabinet. [...] Motorization removes the treadle belt and so opens {{the question of how to}} drive the <b>bobbin</b> <b>winder.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Bobbin</b> <b>Winder</b> (F175) {{wound yarn}} onto a bobbin for weaving. [...] In this painting, {{made in the}} winter of 1883-1884, Van Gogh uses touches of light grey to depict the light falling on the dark room and instrument.|$|E
2500|$|Driving the <b>bobbin</b> <b>winder</b> with a {{separate}} belt, hooked onto the motor pulley whenever needed, means that the standard V belt cannot be used to drive the handwheel. [...] A less-desirable stretch belt, easier to get onto and off the motor pulley, must be used instead.|$|E
2500|$|Driving {{both the}} {{handwheel}} and the <b>bobbin</b> <b>winder</b> {{with a single}} belt running in a triangular path causes traction problems at the motor, due to decreased belt contact area (from 90 degrees to about 60 degrees). [...] This can be compensated by high belt tension, but that in turn will wear out the bearings and quickly exhaust a stretch belt.|$|E
