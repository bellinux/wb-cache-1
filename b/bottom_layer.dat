5|$|When {{cephalopod}} molluscs like squid and cuttlefish {{find themselves}} against a light background, they contract {{many of their}} chromatophores, concentrating the pigment into a smaller area, resulting in a pattern of tiny, dense, but widely spaced dots, appearing light. When they enter a darker environment, they allow their chromatophores to expand, creating a pattern of larger dark spots, and making their bodies appear dark. Amphibians such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped chromatophore cells in separate layers of their skin. The top layer contains 'xanthophores' with orange, red, or yellow pigments; the middle layer contains 'iridophores' with a silvery light-reflecting pigment; while the <b>bottom</b> <b>layer</b> contains 'melanophores' with dark melanin.|$|E
5|$|Most {{vertebrate}} {{species have}} a cerebellum {{and one or}} more cerebellum-like structures, brain areas that resemble the cerebellum in terms of cytoarchitecture and neurochemistry. The only cerebellum-like structure found in mammals is the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), {{one of the two}} primary sensory nuclei that receive input directly from the auditory nerve. The DCN is a layered structure, with the <b>bottom</b> <b>layer</b> containing granule cells {{similar to those of the}} cerebellum, giving rise to parallel fibers that rise to the superficial layer and travel across it horizontally. The superficial layer contains a set of GABAergic neurons called cartwheel cells that resemble Purkinje cells anatomically and chemically—they receive parallel fiber input, but do not have any inputs that resemble climbing fibers. The output neurons of the DCN are pyramidal cells. They are glutamatergic, but also resemble Purkinje cells in some respects—they have spiny, flattened superficial dendritic trees that receive parallel fiber input, but they also have basal dendrites that receive input from auditory nerve fibers, which travel across the DCN in a direction at right angles to the parallel fibers. The DCN is most highly developed in rodents and other small animals, and is considerably reduced in primates. Its function is not well understood; the most popular speculations relate it to spatial hearing in one way or another.|$|E

The colors are the result of a combination of factors. Some species like Chrsyocoris stockerus and Scutellera nobilis display colors from multiple thin layers of pigmented chitin. The colors often change or become duller when the specimens are dried, due to the topmost chitinous layer becoming opaque and obscuring the colors of the <b>bottom</b> <b>layer.</b> The colors can be restored by moistening the surfaces with water.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{investigation}} board the capsizing of Finn-Baltic was {{a direct result of}} cargo shifting, caused by the <b>bottom</b> <b>layer</b> of the ore concentrate becoming saturated with water and liquefying. When the vessel encountered heavy seas and began to roll, the cargo in the forward part of the hold shifted, resulting in a permanent list of roughly two degrees. When the crew attempted to turn the combination against the wind, a standard procedure in such situation, the remaining cargo moved as a single mass due to the centrifugal force, sliding against the port side coamings and capsizing the vessel.|$|E
25|$|In {{each of the}} {{examples}} discussed so far the constituents have been miscible in all proportions with each other. For example, any amount of ethanol can be mixed with any amount of water to form a homogeneous solution. There are pairs of solvents for which {{this is not the}} case. For example, if equal volumes of chloroform (water solubility 0.8 g/100 ml at 20°C) and water are shaken together and then left to stand, the liquid will separate into two layers. Analysis of the layers shows that the top layer is mostly water {{with a small amount of}} chloroform dissolved in it, and the <b>bottom</b> <b>layer</b> is mostly chloroform with a small amount of water dissolved in it. If the two layers are heated together, the system of layers will boil at 53.3°C, which is lower than either the boiling point of chloroform (61.2°C) or the boiling point of water (100°C). The vapor will consist of 97.0% chloroform and 3.0% water regardless of how much of each liquid layer is present (provided both layers are indeed present). If the vapor is re-condensed, the layers will reform in the condensate, and will do so in a fixed ratio, which in this case is 4.4% of the volume in the top layer and 95.6% in the <b>bottom</b> <b>layer.</b> Such a system of solvents is known as a heteroazeotrope. The diagram illustrates how the various phases of a heteroazeotrope are related.|$|E
40|$|The <b>bottom</b> {{boundary}} <b>layer</b> is an unstratified {{thin layer}} above the sea floor, {{separated from the}} more strongly stratified interior. Formation of a thin <b>bottom</b> boundary <b>layer</b> {{in the presence of}} stratification and a sloping bottom is common, and well characterized by theory. This thin layer is an important source of mixing over the continental shelf, and it plays a fundamental role in several continental shelf physical and biogeochemical processes, such as buoyancy advection, bottom material transport and hypoxia formation. In this research, Both observations and numerical models are used to study models' ability of reproducing observed stratification and <b>bottom</b> boundary <b>layer</b> dynamics over the Texas-Louisiana shelf. Simulated vertical stratification, which is also representing the vertical density structure, was first evaluated since it directly controls the <b>bottom</b> boundary <b>layer</b> structure itself and is important for other <b>bottom</b> boundary <b>layer</b> dynamics. A new metric, the histogram of vertical stratification, is introduced in this research to evaluate the models' ability of reproducing observed stratification in a bulk sense. The improvement in model performance is attributed to the finer horizontal and temporal resolutions of a model, while factors like open boundary conditions and vertical resolutions are modified without any improvement in the ability of the model to simulate observed stratification. Towed, undulating CTD profiles collected during Mechanisms Controlling Hypoxia (MCH) program also detected mid-water oxygen minima in many transects. These intrusions are connected with the <b>bottom</b> boundary <b>layer</b> and follows the pycnocline seaward as a mid-water column tongue of low oxygen. We calculate convergence within the <b>bottom</b> boundary <b>layer</b> relative to density surfaces using the simulated results; there is a convergence in the <b>bottom</b> boundary <b>layer</b> at the location where the pycnocline intercepts the bottom, creating an injection of <b>bottom</b> boundary <b>layer</b> water into the pycnocline. Convergent flow at the bottom, relative to isopycnal surfaces, is strongest in the density classes associated with the oxygen minimum layer. We believe these mid-water oxygen minima are actually intrusions of low oxygen protruding from the <b>bottom</b> boundary <b>layer</b> via buoyancy advection driven convergence, following the main pycnocline...|$|R

Although concentrations of nutrients were generally low {{as in the}} case of the previous studies, it became clear that nitrate and ammoni-um increased considerably in the middle and <b>bottom</b> <b>layers</b> during the winter months. These increments may be attributed to degradation of dead planktonic and/or benthic algae and probably escaped observation in the former surveys.

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that {{the area around the}} site has received more than 72 inches of rain since A.D. 1450, which was more than needed to support crop growth there. Because of the large amount of rainfall at Machu Picchu, it was found that irrigation was not needed for the terraces. The terraces received so much rain that they were built specifically to allow for ample drainage of the extra water. Excavation and soil analyses done by Kenneth Wright in the 90's showed that the terraces were built in layers, with a <b>bottom</b> <b>layer</b> of larger stones covered by loose gravel. On top of the gravel was a layer of mixed sand and gravel packed together, with rich topsoil covering all of that. It was proven that the topsoil was probably moved from the valley floor to the terraces because it was much more rich than the soil higher up the mountain.|$|E

The highly weathered vesicular trap and underlying weathered jointed and fractured massive trap constitutes the main water yielding zones. The soil is mostly formed from igneous rocks and are black, medium black, shallow and calcareous types having different depths and profiles.|$|E
