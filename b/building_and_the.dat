40|$|Cities are urban {{settlements}} of people, {{in which}} they perform the drama of life. It suggests his capacity to use his intellect and sensitive nature to organize physical objects around for himself to lead {{a better way of}} life. However, in ever increasing density in buildings, a city is sometimes regarded as a mere physical object with an esthetic gesture. It is felt essential, therefore, to remind ourselves that it is rather a larger experience than a superficial, tangible object to the eye. Hidden or unseen qualities in a city should be polished and refined to make it a better place for living. 'Dialogue' exists between <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city is one such quality, which strengthens <b>the</b> strong bond <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city. The importance of dialogue between <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city is, that it is quality which is essential to be seen in all the successful cities in the world. Therefore <b>the</b> 'dialogue' between <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city as a non physical quality which relates qualitative experiences in cities is examined. Successful experiences of the past, where <b>the</b> dialogue between <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city is found, is being discussed. Examples are discussed to convince <b>and</b> to show <b>the</b> importance of the dialogue created between <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city as a gesture to make better living environments for human beings...|$|R
