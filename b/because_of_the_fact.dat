5|$|There are {{numerous}} contemporary, or near-contemporary, {{sources of information}} about the reign of Richard III. These include the Croyland Chronicle, Commines' Mémoires, the report of Dominic Mancini, the Paston Letters, the Chronicles of Robert Fabyan and numerous court and official records, including a few letters by Richard himself. However, the debate about Richard's true character and motives continues, both because of the subjectivity of many of the written sources, reflecting the generally partisan nature of writers of this period, and <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that none was written by men with an intimate knowledge of Richard, even if they had met him in person.|$|E
5|$|Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas {{arrived in}} the colony of Guatemala in 1537 and {{immediately}} campaigned to replace violent military conquest with peaceful missionary work. Las Casas offered to achieve the conquest of the Land of War through the preaching of the Catholic faith. It was the Dominicans who promoted {{the use of the}} name Verapaz instead of the Land of War. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the land had not been possible to conquer by military means, the governor of Guatemala, Alonso de Maldonado, agreed to sign a contract promising he would not establish any new encomiendas in the area should Las Casas' strategy succeed. Las Casas and a group of Dominican friars established themselves in Rabinal, Sacapulas and Cobán, and managed to convert several native chiefs using a strategy of teaching Christian songs to merchant Indian Christians who then ventured into the area.|$|E
5|$|When Maribor was established, some of {{the club}} {{officials}} were favouring the red and white colours, while the traditional colours of Branik were black and white. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that many football teams in Yugoslavia wore red and white or black and white jerseys, most notably Red Star Belgrade and Partizan, Maribor officials decided for a new and fresh combination. They decided to {{follow the example of}} Fiorentina, which at the time {{was one of the most}} successful clubs in Europe, and their purple and white combination. Oto Blaznik, the first captain in history of the club, was the one who proposed the combination after seeing the Italian side play. Eventually, they changed the secondary colour to yellow. In July 2015, white replaced yellow as the secondary colour. Today, Maribor play their home matches in purple and away matches in white kits. Since July 2011, the club's kit manufacturer is Adidas.|$|E

There is a need to rebuild the membership and establish a true sense of community and commitment within the Club.|$|R
5000|$|The third field season {{continued}} <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second field {{season and}} referenced its findings {{for a greater}} understanding of context. Several pits were excavated during the third field season; some stratigraphy was found to be unreliable <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that, <b>the</b> artifacts near the surface had mixed dates, and [...] "the land surface was removed with heavy machinery back in 1994," [...] almost completely destroying the classic and post-classic artifacts. A looter's pit was also found while excavating.|$|R
5|$|With the {{creation}} of the Interstate Highway System in 1956, the approach to the Lincoln Tunnel was planned to become an Interstate Highway along with present-day Route 3, which itself {{was not included in the}} Interstate Highway System because New Jersey thought it would be too expensive to bring it up to Interstate Highway standards. However, the Lincoln Tunnel approach was included in the Interstate Highway System and in 1959, it was renumbered from Route 3 to I-495 despite the fact it does not meet Interstate Highway standards. Shortly after the road became I-495, the western portion of the road was brought up to Interstate Highway standards with the improvements of the interchanges with the New Jersey Turnpike and Route 3. I-495 was intended to connect with New York's I-495 by way of the Mid-Manhattan Expressway; however, this proposed freeway through Manhattan was canceled in 1971 due to strong opposition to the road running through the heart of Midtown Manhattan. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that New Jersey's I-495 would not be connected to New York's, NJDOT started referring to the route as Route 495 in 1979. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the decommissioning of I-495 between I-95 and Pleasant Avenue/Park Avenue in Union City in 1980. In 1986, AASHTO approved the decommissioning of the rest of the I-495 designation in New Jersey.|$|E

25|$|Sunnis are a {{majority}} in most Muslim communities in Southeast Asia, China, South Asia, Africa, most of the Arab World, and among Muslims in the United States (of which 85–90% are Sunnis). This can also be confusing <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that the majority of}} Arab Muslims in the United States are Shia, while the majority of Arab Americans are Christians, the conflation of Arab and Muslim being quite common.|$|E
50|$|Florida was won by {{incumbent}} President George W. Bush by a 5.0% {{margin of}} victory. Prior to the election, most news organizations considered this a swing state. Once again Florida was under <b>the</b> national spotlight <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> {{that it had}} a high number of electoral votes (27) and <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controversy surrounding the 2000 Florida vote still fresh in <b>the</b> minds <b>of</b> voters. <b>The</b> turnout was also much higher, going from an estimated 6 million voters to over 7.5 million voters showing up to vote.|$|R

5000|$|After an {{exhaustive}} three-year investigation into <b>the</b> destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> videotapes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interrogations (including pictures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interrogators), the Justice Department announced in November 2010 {{it would not}} pursue any charges against Jose Rodriguez. As the Washington Post reported, [...] "Robert S. Bennett, an attorney for Rodriguez, said he is 'pleased that the Justice Department {{has decided not to}} go forward against Mr. Rodriguez. This is <b>the</b> right decision <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> and <b>the</b> law.'" [...] Commentator Glenn Greenwald described the decision as just another in a long line <b>of</b> instances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Obama White House granting legal immunity to Bush-era crimes.|$|R
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Subbarayan's {{regime was}} {{appointed}} and largely {{controlled by the}} Governor, it became the target of strong criticism both from the Justicites {{as well as the}} Swarajists. In March 1927, P. Munuswamy Naidu of the Justice Party passed a motion recommending salary cuts for Government ministers. However, they were defeated by a margin of 41 votes. A no-confidence motion was passed on 23 August 1927, but was defeated 56 to 67 {{with the support of the}} Governor and the members nominated by him.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} playing first-class cricket for Northamptonshire until 1938, but did {{not play}} at all in 1934 or 1935. This is <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> – unmentioned by Wisden at the time – {{that he had been}} convicted of manslaughter after his car had been in collision with a motorcycle, killing the latter's pillion passenger. Jupp was sentenced to nine months in prison, and was released in June 1935 after serving half his sentence, {{but did not}} play cricket again until the following year.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the middle}} of July, the NLA entered the Tetovo suburb of Drenovec, which was already emptied of army and police personnel. Armed {{citizens}} organized control points in the suburb and started building positions {{in close proximity to}} former police positions at the stadium. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> the NLA used the Ceasefire to infiltrate Tetovo and come in close to the security forces' positions, General Pande Petrovski issued an order allowing the security forces to open fire if the insurgents came within 200 meters of their positions.|$|E
50|$|The {{area was}} known as Ross Block until 1948, when it was renamed Roslyn. Unfortunately, when the Post Office was {{established}} here, there was already a Roslyn in Dunedin. Therefore, the Terrace End-Roslyn Progressive Association had to find {{another name for the}} area.Rossmont was chosen <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> location; <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> area is higher up from <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> Palmerston North. Recently, perhaps <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local primary school, the name Roslyn has resurfaced.|$|R
25|$|Note {{that this}} formula only works <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{mathematical}} <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> gravity <b>of</b> a uniform spherical body, as measured on or above its surface, {{is the same}} as if all its mass were concentrated at a point at its centre.

25|$|While {{scientists}} {{were trying to}} create a new antidepressant to inhibit the NE re-uptake they accidentally synthesised two new compounds, named talopram and talsupram. The two compounds where not marketed in spite of being potent SNRIs <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that number of suicide attempts were reported in clinical trials. With minor changes to the chemical structure of talopram (figure 6), including a single 6-cyano (CN) substitution, {{scientists were}} able to convert talopram into a potent SSRI, called citalopram. But citalopram can also be viewed as a constrained analogue of paroxetine.|$|E
25|$|Butler {{argues that}} the {{performance}} of gender itself creates gender. Additionally, she compares the performativity of gender {{to the performance of}} the theater. She brings many similarities, including the idea of each individual functioning as an actor of their gender. However she also brings into light a critical difference between gender performance in reality and theater performances. She explains how the theater is much less threatening and does not produce the same fear that gender performances often encounter <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that there is a clear distinction from reality within the theater.|$|E
25|$|Despite (or perhaps <b>because</b> <b>of)</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Wonder Woman {{had fallen}} in love with the first Steve Trevor, the {{producers}} chose to drop any suggestion that Steve Jr. and Wonder Woman were anything more than good friends. Indeed, when an impostor posing as Steve Jr. attempted to seduce Diana, she made it quite clear that she had no sexual interest in him. Executive producer Douglas S. Cramer noted the difficulties in maintaining long-term romantic tension between leads, because the resolution of that romantic tension often results in the cancellation of the series.|$|E
50|$|Nako's {{mother and}} Airi's {{stepmother}} who loves her daughters {{very much and}} will always support their decisions. However, she doesn't like Airi's cooking <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simple <b>fact</b> that Airi doesn't know how to cook. She sees Airi as her daughter and will not hesitate to support her when any problems come up(like in chapter 10, when Airi was suspended for a day).|$|R
50|$|Scandium (Sc) is {{the third}} element in period 4, between calcium and titanium, and is the first {{transition}} metal in the periodic table. Scandium is quite common in nature, but difficult to find because it is most prevalent in rare earth compounds, which are difficult to isolate elements from. Scandium has very few commercial applications <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aforementioned <b>facts,</b> and currently its only major application is in aluminium alloys.|$|R

They commuted back and forth from Philadelphia to see each other.|$|R
25|$|For competition, a blue judogi is worn {{by one of}} the two {{competitors}} {{for ease}} of distinction by judges, referees, and spectators. In Japan, both judoka use a white judogi and the traditional red obi (based on the colors of the Japanese flag) is affixed to the belt of one competitor. Outside Japan, a colored obi may also be used for convenience in minor competitions, the blue judogi only being mandatory at the regional or higher levels, depending on organization. Japanese practitioners and traditionalists tend to look down on the use of blue <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that judo is considered a pure sport, and replacing the pure white judogi for the impure blue is an offense.|$|E
25|$|Even though López did not {{participate}} in the 1941 event, he had time to join the Venezuelan league after returning from Cuba. He was unquestionably the dominant pitcher in the circuit, fashioning a ledger of 9-4 with 55 strikeouts and a 0.67 ERA to win the pitching Triple Crown, while handling a 121-inning work in his first full season for Magallanes, allowing also only nine earned runs on 67 hits and 22 walks. As an ace pitcher and cleanup hitter, he also hurled two no-hitters, led in innings pitched, and smashed the only home run of the tournament. Although this was a wasted effort, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of his team lost the final and decisive game to the eventual champions Patriotas de Venezuela.|$|E
25|$|S. septentrionalis is preyed upon by {{numerous}} species. This is largely <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it resides at {{an elevation of}} 300 meters above sea level, a lower elevation than most paper wasps. Specifically, army ants will regularly feed on them along with other species of paper wasps. This prevalent predation has resulted in S. septentrionalis making numerous adaptations, some of which include forming a complex nest structure, choosing a nest-site that reduces exposure to predators, and establishing defensive mechanisms. S. septentrionalis has also been known to defend against army ants by piling their bodies up against the nest entrance. However, army ant predation can be extreme enough to regulate the density of a colony and keep populations of S. septentrionalis and other species of paper wasps regulated.|$|E

25|$|When this sea, {{called the}} Littorina Sea, the {{ancestor}} of the Baltic Sea, withdrew, the Dalälven found itself blocked at Avesta {{by one of}} these eskers formed by the ice sheet: Badelundaåsen. In effect, before the ice age, the river continued {{in the direction of}} the Mälaren, in which it emptied itself and it so had flooded a valley along this entire section. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of the presence of this obstacle, it was forced to head northeast. So, in the whole section of the Lower Dalälven, the river did not have the time to flood a true valley. It thus had to adapt itself to the topology of the terrain, forming large fjärds with many isles in the flattest sections and by contrast a course narrower and faster at the different eskers encountered along the way.|$|E
25|$|Roughly a {{week after}} the nest is complete, the first larvae begin to hatch, and these will become adults {{approximately}} 30 days after hatching, marking the end of the pre-emergence phase {{and the beginning of the}} post emergence phase. It is at this point when the emergence of workers is largely dependent on the necessity to produce reproductive females that will become queens. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that S. septentrionalis is a polygynous species, more than one queen will exist at a given time, and often the number of queens will fluctuate. When queen number is small, worker number will be high and thus females will grow ovaries that are well developed so that they may reproduce as queens. When queen number is high, worker number is small, and steps will be taken to inseminate females in order to keep them from reproducing, and they will become workers.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the effort}} from WWE {{to promote the}} Brock Lesnar versus Goldberg contest, some critics {{expressed}} disappointment with the match, with many in Madison Square Garden booing both competitors and only cheering for Steve Austin <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that both participants were set to leave the WWE after the event with Goldberg not signing a new contract and Lesnar {{going to work in}} the NFL. Goldberg returned to WWE in 2016 and reignited his rivalry with Lesnar, after the pair had been feuding for several months through social media and during promotional work for the WWE 2K17 video game, which featured Lesnar as the cover star and Goldberg as the pre-order bonus. This would set up a rematch between the two at the 2016 Survivor Series, where Goldberg defeated Lesnar after two consecutive spears and a Jackhammer in 1 minute and 26 seconds. A final match between them occurred at WrestleMania 33 in April 2017, where Lesnar defeated Goldberg in a match for the Universal Championship to end the feud.|$|E
2500|$|This {{shows that}} the T {{operation}} is nontrivial, which {{has a number of}} consequences.

40|$|<b>The</b> focus <b>of</b> {{this book}} is to {{investigate}} solutions that, when implemented in any heterogeneous wireless network, shall enhance the existing standard without impacting the standard or changing the wireless transceiver’s functions. Thus achieving efficient interoperability at much reduced overheads. The techniques proposed in this research are centred on the lower layers. This <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that WiMax and WiFi standards have not addressed <b>the</b> backward compatibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two technologies at the MAC and PHY layers for the baseband functions. The proposed technique is to combine WiMax and WiFi signals so to utilise the same "baseband implementation chain" to handle both of these technologies, thus insuring ubiquitous data communication. WiMax-WiFi Baseband Convergence (W 2 BC) implementation is proposed to offer an optimum configurable solution targeted at combining the 802. 16 d WiMax and the 802. 11 a,n WiFi technologies. This approach provides a fertile ground for future work into combining more OFDM based wireless technologies. Based on analysis and simulation, the W 2 BC can achieve saving in device cost, size, power consumption and implementation complexity when compared to current side-by-side implementations for these two technologies...|$|R
