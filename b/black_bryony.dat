60|$|But, {{beside the}} grand Plantains and Bananas, {{there are other}} {{interesting}} plants, whose names you have often heard. The tall plant with stem unbranched, but knotty and zigzag, and leaves atop like hemp, but of a cold purplish tinge, is the famous Cassava, {313a} or Manioc, the old food of the Indians, poisonous till its juice is squeezed out in a curious spiral grass basket. The young Laburnums (as they seem), with purple flowers, are Pigeon-peas, {313b} right good to eat. The creeping vines, like our Tamus, or <b>Black</b> <b>Bryony,</b> are Yams, {313c}--best of all roots.|$|E
50|$|According to {{secondary}} sources, all {{components of the}} <b>black</b> <b>bryony</b> plant, including the tubers, are poisonous due to saponin content. Therefore, it is not typically used internally; however, {{it has been used}} as a poultice for bruises and inflamed joints. It has been suggested that <b>black</b> <b>bryony</b> be used topically with caution, due to a tendency for the plant to cause painful blisters.|$|E
50|$|Studies have {{isolated}} {{calcium oxalate}} deposits and histamines in the berry juice and rhizomes, which {{may contribute to}} skin irritation and contact dermatitis associated with <b>black</b> <b>bryony.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>Bryony</b> {{is highly}} {{poisonous}} {{and should not}} be ingested at all at least when raw. When cooked, young shoots are commonly eaten in southern France, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Croatia.|$|E
50|$|Dioscorea communis (sometimes {{placed in}} the {{segregate}} genus Tamus) is a species of flowering plant in the yam family Dioscoreaceae and {{is commonly known as}} <b>black</b> <b>bryony,</b> lady's-seal, and black bindweed.|$|E
50|$|The {{lake shore}} {{supports}} several rare plant species, including yellow bird's-nest (Monotropa hypopitys), lady’s mantle (Alchemilla glaucescens), ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae), <b>black</b> <b>bryony</b> (Tamus communis), intermediate wintergreen (Pyrola media) and bird's-nest orchid (Neottia nidus-avis).|$|E
50|$|It {{is an old}} road, {{recorded}} back to 1597, {{which is}} now a quiet country lane. The path is lined with ancient hedgerows and there are old oak, field maple and ash treees. Honeysuckle and <b>black</b> <b>bryony</b> provide evidence of the hedgerow's antiquity.|$|E
50|$|Gentle slopes on the Maiden Paps support species-rich Magnesian Limestone {{grassland}} {{dominated by}} upright brome Bromus erectus, blue moor-grass Sesleria albicans, crested hair-grass Koeleria macrantha, red fescue Festuca rubra, glaucous sedge Carex flacca and herbs such as common rock-rose Helianthemum nummularia, salad burnet Sanguisorba minor, fairy flax Linum catharticum, wild thyme Thymus praecox, pignut Conopodium majus, small scabious Scabiosa columbaria and sea plantain Plantago maritima. Of particular note {{is a small}} population of perennial flax Linum anglicum, which occurs here towards the northern limit of its distribution range in Great Britain, and locally uncommon plants such as frog orchid Coeloglossum viride, autumn gentian Gentianella amarella, purple milk-vetch Astragalus danicus and thrift Armeria maritima. Steep south facing slopes above the reclaimed railway line support a more open, herbrich grassland characterised by common quaking-grass Briza media, blue moorgrass, crested hair-grass and red fescue with yarrow Achillea millefolium, hairy violet Viola hirta, hoary ragwort Senecio erucifolius, and fragrant orchid Gymnadenia conopsea. Other uncommon plants include pale St. John’s-wort Hypericum montanum, lesser meadow-rue Thalictrum minus, and <b>black</b> <b>bryony</b> Tamus communis.|$|E
5000|$|An old orchard with {{twenty or}} so trees was complemented by a new orchard planted in the late 1960s. A wide variety of cooking and eating apples were joined by pear tree varieties, {{cherries}} and plums. The flora of the old orchard sward was dominated by primroses and violets. [...] Detailed plans of these primroses were plotted yearly in the 1970s to show the change in distribution. In addition to the wild type, white, red, pink and multi-headed varieties grew here. Green alkanet (Pentaglottis sempervirens) grew here, together with <b>black</b> <b>bryony,</b> flowering currant, horseradish, butcher's broom (Ruscus aculeatus), bluebells (blue, pink and white), Aquilegia and other several other species.The grounds of the house were particularly rich in ferns, mosses, liverworts, and lichens. The lichens grow in profusion on the old walls, slate roofing tiles and tree bark, especially of the older specimen trees, such as the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), sessile oak (Quercus petraea), horse-chestnuts and the copper beeches (Fagus sylvatica cuprea). Xanthoria parietina was a common lichen growth on the boiler house tiles. The giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) has many small depressions in its bark made by treecreepers.|$|E
50|$|The {{area of the}} Rock {{through which}} the path passes {{is one of the}} richest in Gibraltar for flora and fauna. The start of the path is {{relatively}} sparsely vegetated and includes species such as White Asparagus, Common Asphodel, Germander and Esparto Grass. Its later sections proceed through dense vegetation that is typical of Mediterranean maquis shrubland - a widespread biome in southern Europe that consists of densely growing evergreen shrubs adapted to resist droughts. The trees along the path are predominantly olives. These have all grown since the Great Siege of Gibraltar (1779-83) when the Upper Rock's original woodland was felled by the British garrison to serve as fuel. It is thought that the present arboreal flora of Gibraltar is the result of seeds being brought onto the Rock by birds. The maquis flora includes dense knots of creepers such as smilax, December clematis, pipe fine and <b>black</b> <b>bryony,</b> while ferns such as southern polypody and the rusty-back fern exploit the shade provided by the canopy. Many species of aromatic herbs and flowers also grow alongside the path, including purple Jerusalem sage and bee orchids. The fauna includes various species of birds that are adapted to life in the maquis, including the Sardinian warbler, wren and woodcock. Barbary partridges {{can be seen in the}} more open areas adjoining the path. Europe's largest lizard, the ocellated lizard, also lives in the vicinity, along with Iberian wall lizard, Algerian sand racer and Moorish gecko.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In Europe, only {{a limited}} number of {{cross-cultural}} comparative field studies or meta-analyses have been focused on the dynamics through which folk plant knowledge changes over space and time, while a few studies have contributed to the understanding of how plant uses change among newcomers. Nevertheless, ethnic minority groups and/or linguistic “isles” in Southern and Eastern Europe may provide wonderful arenas for understanding the various factors that influence changes in plant uses. Methods A field ethnobotanical study was carried out in Mundimitar (Montemitro in Italian), a village of approx. 450 inhabitants, located in the Molise region of South-Eastern Italy. Mundimitar is a South-Slavic community, composed of the descendants of people who migrated to the area during the first half of the 14 th century, probably from the lower Neretva valley (Dalmatia and Herzegovina regions). Eighteen key informants (average age: 63. 7) were selected using the snowball sampling technique and participated in in-depth interviews regarding their Traditional Knowledge (TK) of the local flora. Results Although TK on wild plants is eroded in Montemitro among the youngest generations, fifty-seven taxa (including two cultivated species, which were included due to their unusual uses) were quoted by the study participants. Half of the taxa have correspondence in the Croatian and Herzegovinian folk botanical nomenclature, and the other half with South-Italian folk plant names. A remarkable link to the wild vegetable uses recorded in Dalmatia is evident. A comparison of the collected data with the previous ethnobotanical data of the Molise region and of the entire Italian Peninsula pointed out a few uses that have not been recorded in Italy thus far: the culinary use of boiled <b>black</b> <b>bryony</b> (Tamus communis) shoots in sauces and also on pasta; the use of squirting cucumber (Ecballium elaterium) juice for treating malaria in humans; the aerial parts of the elderberry tree (Sambucus nigra) for treating erysipelas in pigs; the aerial parts of pellitory (Parietaria judaica) in decoctions for treating haemorrhoids. Conclusions The fact that half of the most salient species documented in our case study – widely available both in Molise and in Dalmatia and Herzegovina – retain a Slavic name could indicate that they may have also been used in Dalmatia and Herzegovina before the migration took place. However, given the occurrence of several South-Italian plant names and uses, also a remarkable acculturation process affected the Slavic community of Montemitro during these last centuries. Future directions of research should try to simultaneously compare current ethnobotanical knowledge of both migrated communities and their counterparts in the areas of origin. </p...|$|E
