It helps to ensure that grantees have met all financial and reporting requirements. It also allows federal agencies to identify and redirect unused funds to other projects and priorities as authorized or to return unspent balances to the Department of the Treasury (Treasury). At the end of fiscal year 2011, GAO identified more than $ 794 million in funding remaining in expired grant accounts (accounts that were more than 3 months past the grant end date and had no activity for 9 months or more) in the Payment Management System (PMS). GAO found that undisbursed <b>balances</b> <b>remained</b> in some grant accounts several years past their expiration date: $ 110. 9 million in undisbursed funding remained unspent more than 5 years past the grant end date, including $ 9. 5 million that remained unspent for 10 years or more. Nevertheless, the more than $ 794 million in undisbursed <b>balances</b> <b>remaining</b> in PMS represents an improvement in closing out expired grant accounts with undisbursed balances in PMS compared to the approximately $ 1 billion GAO found in 2008.
