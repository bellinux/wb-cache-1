Among the antitumor agents discovered in recent years, the identification of various 2 -(4 -aminophenyl) <b>benzothiazoles</b> as potent and selective antitumor drugs against different cancer cell lines has stimulated remarkable interest. Some of the <b>benzothiazoles</b> are known to induce cell cycle arrest, activation of caspases and interaction with DNA molecule. Based on these interesting properties of <b>benzothiazoles</b> and to obtain new biologically active agents, a series of novel 4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydrobenzo[d]thiazole derivatives 5 (a–i) were synthesized and evaluated for their efficacy as antileukemic agents in human leukemia cells (K 562 and Reh).

50|$|The {{modified}} Julia olefination, {{also known}} as the one-pot Julia olefination is a modification of the classical Julia olefination. The replacement of the phenyl sulfones with heteroaryl sulfones greatly alters the reaction pathway. The most popular example is the <b>benzothiazole</b> sulfone. The reaction of the <b>benzothiazole</b> sulfone (1) with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) gives a metallated benzothiazolyl sulfone, which reacts quickly with aldehydes (or ketones) to give an alkoxide intermediate (2). Unlike the phenyl sulfones, this alkoxide intermediate (2) is more reactive and will undergo a Smiles rearrangement to give the sulfinate salt (4). The sulfinate salt (4) will spontaneously eliminate sulfur dioxide and lithium benzothiazolone (5) producing the desired alkene (6).|$|E
50|$|Since the <b>benzothiazole</b> {{variation}} of the Julia olefination does not involve equilibrating intermediates, the stereochemical outcome {{is a result of}} the stereochemistry of the initial carbonyl addition.
