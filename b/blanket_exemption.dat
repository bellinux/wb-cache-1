40|$|ABSTRACT: Despite the intensifying {{debate over}} the {{taxation}} of internet commerce, the relevant issues have not been given a systematic treatment {{in the context of}} the literature on optimal taxation. We present such an analysis, and investigate separately the taxation of business purchases of intermediate goods, the taxation of consumer purchases of final goods and services, and the various issues of administration and compliance costs as they apply to the development of e-commerce. We conclude that, generally, the optimal tax literature can not be used in support of a <b>blanket</b> tax <b>exemption</b> for internet purchases. Certain conditions could lead to the optimality of an exemption, but those conditions are not likely to be met in practice...|$|R

25|$|The {{programme}} {{also criticized}} FIFA for allegedly requiring World Cup host bidding nations {{to agree to}} implement special laws for the World Cup, including a <b>blanket</b> tax <b>exemption</b> for FIFA and sponsors, and limitation of workers' rights. It alleged that governments of bidding nations are required to keep {{the details of the}} required laws confidential during the bidding process; but that they were revealed by the Dutch government, which refused to agree to them, as a result of which it was told by FIFA that its bid could be adversely affected. According to the programme, following Jennings' earlier investigations he was banned from all FIFA press conferences, for reasons he says have not been made clear; and the accused officials failed to answer questions about his latest allegations, either verbally or by letter.|$|R

This exemption was granted by the government on 9 June 2011 (with similar exemptions to the National Investigating Agency (NIA), the Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation and the National Intelligence Grid (Natgrid)) on the basis of national security. It was criticized by the Central Information Commission and RTI activists, who said the <b>blanket</b> <b>exemption</b> violated the letter and intent of the RTI Act.

40|$|MCom (South African and International Taxation), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 South Africa {{is in need}} {{of foreign}} direct {{investment}} (FDI) to increase economic growth and alleviate unemployment and poverty. To succeed in obtaining this FDI, South Africa must compete {{with the rest of the}} world for the available FDI. The global economic outlook is currently still uncertain and the growth of advanced economies are slowing down while Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa continue to grow at a steady pace. South Africa, as part of Sub-Saharan Africa, should take advantage of this growth on the African continent as well as internationally. Although studies have been performed to ascertain the tax policies of countries, the role of taxation applied by countries and the effects of taxation on FDI, there have been few studies on the tax policies specifically in respect of withholding taxes on interest. The new South African withholding tax on interest, applicable to South African source interest payments to non-residents, has been proposed to be included in terms of sections 49 A to 49 H in the Income Tax Act (58 of 1962) and will become effective from 1 January 2015. These sections have been introduced to align the said withholding tax and the section 10 (1) (h) interest exemption, applicable to normal income tax in respect of non-residents, to the withholding taxes on interest and interest exemptions applied globally. Attention should be focused on whether the aforementioned global alignment will be achieved with the introduction of this legislation as South Africa had previously applied a similar legislation called non-residents’ tax on interest (NRTI) which appeared to be unsuccessful. Determining whether this legislation has been aligned with global practice will provide useful insight into whether this new legislation will promote, stagnate or be indifferent to FDI in South Africa, while at the same time not eroding the tax base with overly generous exemptions. This study reviews and compares the taxes implemented globally specifically in relation to withholding taxes on interest in a selection of countries, namely the developing countries Brazil, Russia, India, China, Mozambique and Namibia and the developed countries Germany and Denmark. Other determinants which will also have an impact on the comparisons of these withholding taxes are, for example, normal and withholding tax interest exemptions and repo rates – all of which have been incorporated into this comparative study. Based on the literature reviewed and the comparative analysis, the study concludes that the South African withholding tax on interest is effectively designed to keep attracting foreign lending in order to remain competitive in international markets. It is further shown that the South African legislation in respect of the section 10 (1) (h) <b>blanket</b> interest <b>exemption</b> is aligned to that of global practice. Master...|$|R

50|$|In {{discussing}} {{the status of}} the armed forces shortly after the founding of the State of Israel, representatives of orthodox religious parties argued that yeshiva students should be exempt from military service. This derives from the Jewish tradition that if a man wants to dedicate his life to religious study, society must allow him to do so. The request of orthodox political parties to 'prevent neglect of studying the Torah' was granted by the authorities. But in recent years this exemption practice has become the subject of debate in Israeli society, as the absolute and the relative numbers of the men who received this exemption rose sharply. In 2012, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled in the case of Ressler et al. v. The Knesset et al.. that the <b>blanket</b> <b>exemption</b> granted to ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students was ultra vires the authority of the Minister of Defence, and that it violated Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty and was, therefore, unconstitutional.|$|E
5000|$|PAIA {{does not}} replace the {{constitutional}} right. Because, however, it purports to [...] "give effect to" [...] it, parties must generally assert the right via the Act. Thus the constitutional right is {{for the most part}} confined to the indirect role of informing the interpretation of the Act. It is possible to rely directly on section 32 only in exceptional cases, most obviously when the validity of the provisions of PAIA itself is being challenged. For example, {{it could be argued that}} the controversial <b>blanket</b> <b>exemption</b> of Cabinet records from the ambit of PAIA—"This Act does not apply to a record of ... the Cabinet and its committees"—is [...] "an unconstitutional restriction of the scope of the right of access to 'information held by the state.'" [...] Since the Cabinet is clearly part of [...] "the state," [...] the exemption is a limitation of the right. Its validity would have to be decided by reference to the limitation clause in the Constitution.|$|E
5000|$|What {{is usually}} meant by {{assumption}} of risk is more precisely termed primary or [...] "express" [...] {{assumption of risk}}. It occurs when the plaintiff has either expressly or implicitly relieved the defendant of the duty to mitigate or relieve the risk causing the injury from which the cause of action arises. It operates as a complete bar to liability {{on the theory that}} upon assumption of the risk, {{there is no longer a}} duty of care running from the defendant to the plaintiff; without a duty owed by the defendant, there can be no negligence on his part. [...] However, primary assumption of risk is not a <b>blanket</b> <b>exemption</b> from liability for the operators of a dangerous activity. The specific risk causing the injury must have been known to, and appreciated by, the plaintiff in order for primary assumption of risk to apply. Also, assumption of risk does not absolve a defendant of liability for reckless conduct.|$|E

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued strong warnings about the risks posed by such drilling and in a 2009 letter, accused MMS of understating the likelihood and potential consequences of a major spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The letter further accused MMS of highlighting the safety of offshore drilling while understating the risks and impact of spills and playing down the fact that spills had been increasing. Both current and former MMS staff scientists said their reports were overruled and altered if they found high risk of accident or environmental impact. Kieran Suckling, director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said, [...] "MMS has given up any pretense of regulating the offshore oil industry.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{alternatives to}} the exempt VAT treatment of public bodies, non-profit organizations and charitable organizations (public service bodies). It focuses in particular on the Canadian VAT (the federal Goods and Services Tax) and its treatment of transactions involving public service bodies, including government to government transactions. Under the Canadian Goods and Services Tax rebate system, most supplies made by public service bodies are exempt but such bodies may claim a rebate for GST paid on purchases made to render such supplies. The rebate schedule is flexible and rebate rates may {{vary according to the}} nature of the activities and jurisdiction of operation (in the case of subnational VATs such as the Harmonized Sales Tax). The Canadian system therefore provides some compensation for VAT paid in purchases made in the course of providing exempt supplies and mitigates some of the inefficiencies and distributional impacts of a <b>blanket</b> <b>exemption.</b> Tax expenditure data for Canada suggest that this support is important. When compared to alternatives to exemption, the Canadian system lies between the extremes of the New Zealand and EU models. In New Zealand, nearly all transactions involving public service bodies are subject to VAT in the normal way, whereas nearly all such transactions are exempt in the EU, subject to an array of complex rules. The paper closes by arguing that the Canadian rebate system is more efficient and predictable than the EU system and should be given serious consideration as an alternative to that system, assuming that applying a New Zealand-style solution in the EU is far too radical a reform to contemplate...|$|E
