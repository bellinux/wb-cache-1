Walder chastises his sons Lothar Frey and Black Walder Rivers, who had been ordered to hold the castle. They defend their loss, as several Riverlords, including House Mallister and House Blackwood, have risen in rebellion against the Freys, and the Brotherhood Without Banners are raiding their supply lines and camps. Walder demands that the Tully stronghold be taken back, refusing to be humiliated <b>by</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> able to hold a single castle. He orders his men to bring in Edmure Tully, held as a prisoner of the Freys since the Red Wedding, and declares that they will use him to retake Riverrun.|$|E

The publication followed the line of Nicolae Moret Blaremberg, made notorious for his radical and republican agenda. Ghica and Macedonski remained close friends until Ghica's 1882 death.|$|E

25|$|The {{coalition}} arose out {{of protests}} against H.R. 4437, a legislative proposal {{that was passed}} by the United States House of Representatives on December 16, 2005, by a vote of 239 to 182, only to die in the United States Senate <b>by</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> brought to the floor before the 109th Congress ended. This bill would have made residing in the U.S. illegally a felony and imposed stiffer penalties on those who knowingly employ and harbour noncitizens illegally. It also called for the construction of new border security fences along portions of the 2,000-mile United States–Mexico border. The coalition takes its name from the date of the first mass protest against the bill, a day which saw upwards of 500,000 demonstrators on the streets of Los Angeles, as well as hundreds of thousands in other major U.S. cities. The March 25, 2006, protests were noted for their peaceful nature, despite the controversy surrounding the immigration issue.|$|E
25|$|Anyone {{who came}} into contact with a human corpse, or grave, was so ritually impure that they had to be {{sprinkled}} with the water produced from the red heifer ritual, in order to become ritually pure again; however, the person who carried out the red heifer ritual and who sprinkled the water, was to be treated as having become ritually impure by doing so. According to biblical scholars, this ritual derives from the same origin as the ritual described in Deuteronomy for a group of people to atone for murder by an unknown perpetrator, according to which a heifer is killed at a stream, and hands are washed over it; biblical scholars believe that these are both ultimately cases of sympathetic magic, and similar rituals existed in Greek and Roman mythology. The masoretic text describes the water produced from the red heifer ritual as a sin offering; some English translations discount this detail, because it differs from other sin offerings <b>by</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> killed at the altar, although biblical scholars believe that this demonstrates a failure by these translations to understand the meaning of sin offerings.|$|E

500|$|An uptempo {{version of}} the main melody for [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina", [...] "Oh What a Circus" [...] acts as an {{introduction}} to the whole musical and is sung after [...] "Requiem for Evita", as Che ponders about the life of Eva. The song was composed in a key of C major with a medium tempo of 128 beats per minute. Essex's voice spanns from C3 to E5 and the song follows a basic sequence of F/C–G7–C–Am/C–Dsus–C–D7/C–G/B as its chord progression. Lyrically, it talks about the news of Eva's death and her funeral, as well as Che's belief that the mourning for her was misplaced and Eva's life and preaching was fraudulent. It compares her life to that of a circus with a choir added during the middle section. The lyrics question the sainthood of Eva and her praise as a godly character among the Argentinians, while taunting her that she had failed her people <b>by</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> immortal. The words had rhyming across the verses like those of ("show/go") and ("town/down") which Rice explained was done intentionally to make the song appear asymmetrical.|$|E
500|$|Starting the 2015–16 NHL season, the Penguins {{had gone}} through a major {{overhaul}} of their roster, adding a number of offensive players such as right winger Phil Kessel.

By the time Johnston was fired on December 12, 2015, after posting a 15–10–3 record through 28 games, some media outlets began speculating that Crosby had aged out of his prime scoring years. On December 16, The Washington Post wrote: [...] "Sidney Crosby has widely been regarded as the NHL's best player since he burst on the scene as a rookie in 2005 ... But Crosby just hasn't been himself this season, scoring just six goals in 29 games and sitting with a plus/minus of minus-seven.
