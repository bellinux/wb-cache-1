25|$|Assembly of the virion uses two {{scaffolding}} proteins, internal scaffolding protein B {{and external}} scaffolding protein D. The function of protein B {{seems to be}} to lower the amount of protein D needed by the virion for assembly. Protein H is a multifunctional structural protein required for piloting the viral DNA into the host cell interior during the entry process. Protein E is a 91-amino acid membrane protein that causes host cell lysis by inhibiting the host translocase MraY. This inhibitory activity is located within the N terminal 29 amino acids. Protein A is a single strand endonuclease and is responsible for the initiation of viral DNA replication. It catalyses cleavage and ligation of a phosphodiester bond between a G and A nucleotide residue pair at the phi X origin. It may not be essential for phage viability but burst sizes are reduced by 50% when it is mutated. Protein A* inhibits host DNA replication. Unlike protein A it is capable of cleaving the phi X viral DNA in the presence of single-stranded binding protein of the host. Protein A*, like Protein A, may not be required for phage viability. Protein C increases the fidelity of the termination and reinitiation reactions and is required for the packagaing of the viral DNA in to the protein shell. Protein K has 56 amino acids and is found in the membrane of the host cell. It appears to be able to increase the <b>burst</b> <b>size</b> of the virus.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this {{extended}} abstract, {{we gather}} {{results on the}} performance of Fiber Delay Line (FDL) buffers, having access to multiple wavelengths on an output fiber. In both optical burst switching (OBS) and optical packet switching (OPS), bursts (or packets) can contend for the same output at the same time, and have to be dealt with. Here, we consider both wavelength conversion and buffering as a means to resolve this contention. By applying an analytical model from a different context, we are able to evaluate performance of a multi-wavelength buffer handling independent arrivals. Several numerical examples assess the accuracy of our approximation, and show that our approach is highly accurate when <b>burst</b> <b>sizes</b> are fixed, and, when a round-robin scheduling policy is adopted, also when <b>burst</b> <b>sizes</b> vary.

40|$|Catering to the {{evolving}} bandwidth-on-demand applications requires flexible provisioning architectures that ensure fairness to both high end and low end users of internet. Dynamic classification of network paths into long and short, based on traffic dependent connection holding times and a wavelength allocation from different subsets for these categories {{is a necessity}} for implementing energy saving hybrid switching, loss recovery and flexi grid bit rate variable schemes. Therefore, this study evaluates such a scheme of dynamic classification based on HMM predicted connection-holding times with tightly integrated adaptive <b>burst</b> <b>sizing</b> and segregated wavelength allocation for long and short categories. Simulation study of a 28 node OBS network shows that this coupled scheme reduces delays and results in throughput improvement of 67 % for long and 12 % for short traffic over schemes that employ adaptive <b>burst</b> <b>sizing</b> based on number of active traffic flows and independent wavelength assignment schemes...|$|R

In OBS, data are forwarded {{in the form of a}} burst of packets; these bursts are assembled and disassembled in the electrical domain, in order to overcome the barrier of non-availability of optical memory. The purpose of this paper is to highlight composite burst assembly as means of overcoming adverse effects of higher <b>burst</b> <b>sizes</b> on queue delay, when aggregate selfsimilar traffic is present within the electrical domain. Such a situation would be found in an environment using Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture. We present an analytical model indicating negative effects on performance by larger <b>burst</b> <b>sizes.</b> Simulated results are then presented to highlight the benefits of using composite burst assembly approach in the presence of bursty traffic.

40|$|The Durham {{spectrograph}} MARS, has "been used {{to study}} the electromagnetic interactions of cosmic ray muons in iron in the range 6 - 200 GeV.

Experimental burst spectra for <b>burst</b> <b>sizes</b> up to 80 particles were established and compared with prediction.

Lysing of the host cell tends to occur after the completion of host DNA replication and immediately prior to cell division.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Optical burst {{switching}} (OBS) {{is a new}} transport architecture {{for the next generation}} optical internet infrastructure which is necessary for the increasing demand of high speed data traffic. Optical burst switching stands between optical packet switching, which is technologically difficult, and optical circuit switching, which is not capable of efficiently transporting bursty internet traffic. Apart from its promising features, optical burst switching suffers from high traffic blocking probabilities. Wavelength conversion coupled with fiber delay lines (FDL) provide one of the best means of contention resolution in optical burst switching networks. In this thesis, we examine the relation between burst loss probability and <b>burst</b> <b>sizes</b> for void filling scheduling algorithms. Simulations are performed for various values of the processing and switching times and for different values of wavelengths per fiber and FDL granularity. The main contribution of this thesis is the analysis of the relationship between <b>burst</b> <b>sizes</b> and processing time and FDL induced voids. This in turn creates {{a better understanding of the}} burstification and contention resolution mechanisms in OBS networks. We show that voids generated during scheduling are governed by the FDL granularity and the product of the per-hop processing delay and residual number of hops until the destination. We also show that differentiation between <b>bursts</b> with different <b>sizes</b> is achieved for different network parameters and a differentiation mechanism based on burst lengths is proposed for OBS networks.
