5|$|In the play, the Ilsa {{character}} is an American named Lois Meredith; {{she does not}} meet Laszlo until after her relationship with Rick in Paris has ended. Rick is a lawyer. To make Rick's motivation more believable, Wallis, Curtiz, and the screenwriters decided to set the film <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> on Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{had more}} serious grounds for {{complaint}} about the Belgian anti-tank defences along the Dyle line, {{that covered the}} Namur–Perwez gap which was not protected by any natural obstacles. Only a few days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> General Headquarters had discovered the Belgians had sited their anti-tank defences (de Cointet defences) several {{miles east of the}} Dyle between Namur–Perwez.|$|E

5|$|Egwene {{begins to}} expose the Black Ajah among the rebels, {{requiring}} every sister to re-swear her allegiances. Fifty sisters are exposed and executed, while twenty are able to escape. Taking advantage of the weakened White Tower defenses following the Seanchan raid, the rebels prepare an immediate attack. Just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> is mounted, the Tower Aes Sedai announce that Elaida was captured in the Seanchan raid, {{and that they would}} have Egwene as their leader, the Amyrlin Seat. The rebels return and they begin rebuilding the Tower.|$|E
5|$|In January 1954, Muong Khoua was re-occupied by Laotian forces, {{which were}} {{subsequently}} overrun once {{more by the}} 316th Division of the Viet Minh. The Laotian commander, {{who lived in the}} village itself with his wife, was killed in his home <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack.</b> Battalions of the French Foreign Legion and Laotian forces suffered losses covering the retreat of garrison survivors. The area of Muong Khoua later became a critical supply route across Dien Bien Phu for the Viet Minh and by 1963 was the site of a construction project for the proposed Route 19.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to trace {{the route of the}} Ford van, police {{examined}} CCTV footage from every major road and motorway taken in England within two days of the bombing. Footage revealed that the van was driven south along the M1 motorway into London on the Friday afternoon <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack.</b> It was seen again heading north along the motorway at 7:40pm, accompanied by the Ford Granada. Detectives surmised that the van had been loaded with explosives in London and that the Granada was intended to be the getaway vehicle. The truck was last recorded travelling east along the M62 motorway towards Manchester at 8:31am {{on the morning of the}} explosion.|$|E
5|$|On {{the edge}} of the Munassib Depression, Bertram risked a double bluff. From 15 October 1942, a week <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> Camouflage {{constructed}} three and a half dummy field regiments of artillery. They were carefully made to appear seriously camouflaged, but day by day, they were maintained less and less well, to allow the enemy to decide it was facing dummy guns at Munassib. When the real battle had begun, the dummies were replaced at night with real artillery, which then kept utterly still for a day. An Axis tank attack on Munassib was shocked to find itself being fired on by the massed 'dummy' guns.|$|E
5|$|Soldiers at {{the base}} noticed warning signs, {{including}} groups of men watching the construction from the nearby village, which was set at a higher elevation than the outpost, and other groups of men moving through nearby mountains. At a dinner meeting in the village, a villager told the Americans that they should shoot any men seen in the mountains, and asked them if U.S. UAVs were keeping watch nearby. The day <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> the militants began flowing water through an irrigation ditch feeding an unused field, creating background noise that masked {{the sounds of the}} advancing fighters.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{had begun}} massing troops near the Soviet border {{even before the}} {{campaign}} in the Balkans had finished. By {{the third week of}} February 1941, 680,000 German soldiers were gathered in assembly areas on the Romanian-Soviet border. In preparation for the attack, Hitler had secretly moved upwards of 3 million German troops and approximately 690,000 Axis soldiers to the Soviet border regions. Additional Luftwaffe operations included numerous aerial surveillance missions over Soviet territory many months <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E
5|$|After 15:00 an airstrike {{was called}} in to {{dislodge}} the surviving Chinese in front of D Company. However, the attack by two US Marine Corps F4U Corsairs was mistakenly directed at the Australians themselves after their positions were wrongly marked by the spotter plane. Two men were killed and several badly burnt by napalm <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> was broken off after the company second-in-command—Captain Michael Ryan—ran out under Chinese fire waving a marker panel. The company medical orderly—Private Ronald Dunque—was subsequently awarded the Military Medal for his efforts assisting the wounded despite his own injuries. The Chinese quickly attempted to exploit the chaos, moving against D Company's long exposed eastern flank. 11 Platoon on the main ridge forward of the summit was subjected to a frontal assault; however, unaffected by the napalm, they broke up the Chinese attack and inflicted heavy casualties on them. Regardless, further Chinese attempts to infiltrate the Australian positions continued into the afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Authorities rapidly {{ruled out}} the {{possibility}} that ETA had a cell in the island, with police believing the attack had been carried out by a unit that had travelled to the island specifically to carry it out. Initial reports stated that the bombers had set the bomb off with a remote control. Once the second bomb was spotted, police announced that it had a timer device, which could have allowed the members of ETA to plant the bomb several days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> and leave the island. Earlier, Government delegate for Majorca, Ramon Socías, had said that security forces believed that the bombers had not left Majorca, and were hiding on the island, waiting for the situation to cool down before attempting to leave.|$|E
50|$|Fabien Clain {{released}} an audio recording <b>the</b> day <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> {{in which he}} personally claimed responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>attacks.</b> Clain is known to intelligence services as a veteran jihadist belonging to ISIL, and of French nationality.|$|R

5|$|During World War II, Rajah Charles Vyner Brooke {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of airstrips in Kuching, Oya, Mukah, Bintulu, and Miri. Construction of the Bintulu airstrip was started in 1934 {{under the direction of}} C.W. Bailey, a Works and Building Inspector for the British Royal Air Force (RAF). All the airstrips were completed except for the Bintulu airstrip, where construction was discontinued in October 1938 due to financial reasons. Japanese forces landed in Miri on 16 December 1941. Sarawak fell into Japanese hands when they conquered Kuching on 24 December 1941. When the Japanese invaded Sarawak, Charles Vyner Brooke already left for Sydney (Australia) <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> while his officers were captured by the Japanese and interned at the Batu Lintang camp. During the Japanese occupation, the Japanese used the airstrip for military purposes. However, the airstrip was heavily bombed by Allied forces. The British began reconstruction of the airstrip after the war; during the project many unexploded bombs were unearthed.|$|E
5|$|Flyers {{distributed}} to recruit participants said {{the attack was}} to begin at 8pmAEST on 10 February. On that day, government websites were targeted by denial-of-service attacks. The Communications Department said the hackers had not infiltrated government security, but had instead swamped government computer servers. Sites were left unavailable for sporadic periods throughout the attack. At one point, the Australian Parliament's website was offline for about two days due to the high volume of requests. Rudd's government site was also inaccessible for some time. As a primary target, the Communications Department also received {{a large amount of}} traffic. Government offices were also flooded with e-mail spam, junk faxes, and prank phone calls. The Prime Minister's homepage was vandalized with pornographic images. The flyer released <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> called for the faxes to focus on cartoon pornography, female ejaculation, and small-breasted pornography.|$|E
5|$|Harvey was not {{embroiled in}} the {{political}} arguments surrounding the action, as he had resigned his commission on 23 May 1809, <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> went ahead, in protest at Cochrane's preferment. Returning to the Navy a year later on 21 March 1810, Harvey was never again called to active service, Gambier blocking his efforts to obtain gainful employment. Despite his failure {{to return to the}} sea, Harvey's seniority brought more promotions; he made vice-admiral in 1810 and finally became a full admiral in 1819. He was also made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1815 when the order was reformed, becoming a Knight Grand Cross in 1825. Harvey's retirement included a further period in politics, returning to his seat as MP for Essex between 1820 and 1830.|$|E
