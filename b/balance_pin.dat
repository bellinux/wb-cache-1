The mortise in the wooden cap on top of the key at this point is lined with bushing cloth which holds the key in position laterally, and prevents looseness and rattling, yet allows the key to move easily.|$|E

40|$|Partitioning is a {{fundamental}} step in the computeraided design process. One of the best algorithms for partitioning is ratio cut [10] but, as many others, {{it does not take}} into account specific properties of multi-terminal nets, especially with regard to module pin count. In this paper, we show that the number of pins per module can be unbalanced if not taken care of properly. Since this unbalance can have important implications, we present a way to improve the <b>pin</b> <b>balance</b> without losing the best partitioning qualities. Keywords: Partitioning, Ratio cut, <b>Balanced</b> <b>pin</b> count, Multi-terminal nets, Rent's rule. 1 Introduction The production of VLSI and ULSI 1 computer chips requires the layout (partitioning, placement and routing) of the chip design on a carrier. The huge amount of components in present-day circuits requires a partitioning of the circuit into smaller modules. This partitioning step is necessary for being able to cope with the "size" of the circuit in the next layout s [...] ...|$|R

50|$|A {{limitation}} {{imposed by}} a compass' construction {{is that the}} <b>balancing</b> bowl's <b>pin,</b> which is connected to a pivot point, only allows, in most compasses, the bowl to tilt by approximately 18 degrees before it will touch {{the side of the}} casing. When this happens its freedom to rotate is lost and the compass becomes unreliable.|$|R
25|$|On the ulna of {{the lower}} arm, wide {{papillae}} ulnares or quill knobs are present, attachment points for large pennaceous feathers. Adult Dakotaraptor individuals were much too heavy to fly. Despite this flightless condition, the feathers were not reduced. There is a variety of possible alternative functions for its wings, including shielding of eggs, display, intimidation and keeping <b>balance</b> while <b>pinning</b> down prey with the sickle claw. These functions however, do not necessitate quill knobs and the describing authors considered it likely that Dakotaraptor descended from a smaller flying ancestor which had them.|$|R
500|$|Both {{halves of}} the technique, that of uke and that of tori, are {{considered}} essential to aikido training. Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation. Tori learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while uke learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which tori places them. This [...] "receiving" [...] of the technique is called ukemi. Uke continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while tori uses position and timing to keep uke off-balance and vulnerable. In more advanced training, uke will sometimes apply [...] to regain <b>balance</b> and <b>pin</b> or throw tori.|$|R
40|$|Angle-resolved {{transport}} measurements {{revealed that}} planar defects dominate flux pinning in the investigated Co-doped BaFe 2 As 2 thin film. For any given field and temperature, the critical current depends {{only on the}} angle between the crystallographic c-axis and the applied magnetic field {{but not on the}} angle between the current and the field. The critical current is therefore limited only by the in-plane component of the Lorentz force but independent of the out-of-plane component, which is entirely <b>balanced</b> by the <b>pinning</b> force exerted by the planar defects. This one-dimensional pinning behavior shows similarities and differences to intrinsic pinning in layered superconductors. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
50|$|After {{the exit}} tooth locks, the balance wheel rotates anti-clockwise, free of {{interference}} from the escapement until the balance spring pulls it back clockwise, and the impulse pin re-enters the fork. This will unlock the escapement, releasing the escape wheel {{so that the}} exit tooth can slide over the impulse plane of the exit pallet, which transfers a clockwise impulse to the <b>balance</b> wheel's impulse <b>pin</b> via the lever fork, while pushing the lever up against the left banking pin. The escape wheel drops again until the entrance tooth locks on the entrance pallet now being {{held in place by}} the left banking pin via the lever. The balance wheel continues clockwise, again free from interference until it is pulled back by the balance spring to the center position. The cycle then starts again.|$|R

This work deals with different structure forms of insulator, such as (pin post, clamp top and tie top). These structures are applied in different tests, as covered and stripped states. The leakage current for these forms were measured by raising the insulator voltage to (5. 25, 6. 35, 7. 57 kV) for covered and stripped state. Partial discharges were determined in covered and stripped state of these insulator forms using (straight and <b>balanced</b> detection method). <b>Pin</b> post insulators have a leakage current and electric field larger than both clamp top and tie top. The clamp top and tie top insulator show almost the same value of leakage current measurements. The stripped conductors always produce large partial discharge than covered conductor...|$|R
5000|$|In early {{watches the}} pallet fork and the lever were made as {{separate}} components and joined together. In later watches {{they were made}} as a single component {{as shown in the}} picture. The combined component is often referred to simply as the [...] "lever". In a straight line Swiss lever type escapement, the lever is shaped like a 'T' or an anchor, which gives this escapement its alternative name of anchor escapement. The lever is pivoted in the center; in operation it rocks back and forth. [...] On the arms of the 'T' are angled surfaces called pallets which alternately engage the teeth of the escapement's escape wheel. The central shaft of the lever ends in a fork, which gives pushes to the <b>balance</b> wheel's impulse <b>pin,</b> which is set off center in a disk on the balance wheel's shaft. To reduce friction, the pallets are made of precisely shaped pieces of ruby jewel. The pallet which the teeth first contact is called the entry pallet, while the other one is called the exit pallet.|$|R
40|$|The Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD), {{the most}} {{prevalent}} form of age-related dementia, is a multifactorial and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD are yet largely unknown. However, the etiopathogenesis of AD likely resides in the interaction between genetic and environmental risk factors. Among the different {{factors that contribute to}} the pathogenesis of AD, amyloid-beta peptides and the genetic risk factor apoE 4 are prominent on the basis of genetic evidence and experimental data. ApoE 4 transgenic mice have deficits in spatial learning and memory associated with inflammation and brain atrophy. Evidences suggest that apoE 4 is implicated in amyloid-beta accumulation, imbalance of cellular antioxidant system and in apoptotic phenomena. The mechanisms by which apoE 4 interacts with other AD risk factors leading to an increased susceptibility to the dementia are still unknown. The aim of this research was to provide new insights into molecular mechanisms of AD neurodegeneration, investigating the effect of amyloid-beta peptides and apoE 4 genotype on the modulation of genes and proteins differently involved in cellular processes related to aging and oxidative <b>balance</b> such as <b>PIN</b> 1, SIRT 1, PSEN 1, BDNF, TRX 1 and GRX 1. In particular, we used human neuroblastoma cells exposed to amyloid-beta or apoE 3 and apoE 4 proteins at different time-points, and selected brain regions of human apoE 3 and apoE 4 targeted replacement mice, as in vitro and in vivo models, respectively. All genes and proteins studied in the present investigation are modulated by amyloid-beta and apoE 4 in different ways, suggesting their involvement in the neurodegenerative mechanisms underlying the AD. Finally, these proteins might represent novel potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets in AD...|$|R
40|$|This thesis can {{be divided}} into two primary works, {{examining}} the effects of uniform and non-uniform pinning arrays of antidots in YBCO thin films, and optimising the deposition of Nb thin films. The ultimate goal was compare the poorly investigated effect of pinning arrays of large antidots in Nb and YBCO thin films, which have different intrinsic pinning properties and different vortex sizes. The non-uniform graded pinning arrays etched into YBCO thin films such as graded, inverted and evenly spaced rings of triangular antidots indicated the success of novel artificial pinning arrays of large antidots could come from the suppression of interstitial flux channels between the edge of the film and the centre, and from some suppression of flux hopping. However, the success of these non-uniform arrays may also be attributed to the formation of a 2 Ì† 7 vortex vacuum 2 Ì† 7 if vortices penetrate the thin film in a non-Bean like flux distribution because of the antidot array. This work is now published in Annalen der Physik in 2017 (J. George, et al., Ann. Phys. (Berlin), 1600283 (2017) / DOI 10. 1002 /andp. 201600283). To begin investigations into Nb, the first step was optimise the process of deposition to reliably produce consistent thin films, and then start investigating pinning arrays. Despite the obstructions in this stage it was determined that in order to deposit films via DC Magnetron Sputtering, the sputtering chamber needs to be exceedingly clean, and free from contaminants, and a deposition temperature of 350 C strikes an ideal <b>balance</b> between vortex <b>pinning</b> and current transparency. Unfortunately the system from Mantis Deposition Systems continues to remain excessively fragile and prone t...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} effect of varying drive on {{metastability}} features exhibited by the vortex matter in single crystals of 2 H-NbSe$_ 2 $ and CeRu$_ 2 $ with varying degree of random <b>pinning.</b> An optimal <b>balance</b> between the <b>pinning</b> and driving force is needed to view the metastability effects in typically weakly pinned specimen of low temperature superconductors. As one uses samples with larger pinning in order to differentiate the response of different metastable vortex states, one encounters a new phenomena, viz., the second magnetization peak (SMP) anomaly prior to the PE. Interplay between the path dependence in the critical current density and the non-linearity in the electromagnetic response determine the metastability effects seen in first and the third harmonic response of the ac susceptibility across the temperature regions of the SMP and the PE. The limiting temperature above which metastability effects cease can be conveniently located in the third harmonic data, and the observed behavior can be rationalized within the Beans Critical State model. A vortex phase diagram showing the different vortex phases for a typically weakly pinned specimen has been constructed via the ac susceptibility data in a crystal of 2 H-NbSe$_ 2 $ which shows the SMP and the PE anomalies. The phase space of coexisting weaker and stronger pinned regions has been identified. It can be bifurcated into two parts, where the order and disorder dominate, respectively. The former part continuously connects to the reentrant disordered vortex phase pertaining to the small bundle pinning regime, where the vortices are far apart, interaction effects are weak and the polycrystalline form of flux line lattice prevails.
