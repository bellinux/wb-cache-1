The battery monitoring electronics was developed with the highest considerations in terms of fail-safe and fail-operational requirements. The electronic design of the battery monitoring circuit integrates the battery busbars and uses new passive <b>balancing</b> <b>components</b> with an innovative busbar cooling solution, thus increasing the reliability and the robustness of the whole battery system.

40|$|CORBA is an {{industrial}} standard for distributed object-oriented applications covering aspects such as heterogeneity and interoperability of products of different vendors. However, the CORBA standard does not define any methods for load balancing {{and there is}} a considerable confusion of terms describing associated load balancing techniques. Starting from the general platform- and language-independent CORBA object model, this paper presents a new hierarchical classification of possible load distribution methods for CORBA applications. The classification is a valuable starting point to identify the load balancing method that is appropriate for a given application. Furthermore, we show the relations to modern software design patterns and indicate the places in a CORBA application where load <b>balancing</b> <b>components</b> such as monitoring (obtaining load information), strategy (performing load distribution decisions), and control (executing the strategy decisions) may be integrated. Besides the discussion of the general object model as defined in the CORBA standard, we deal with concrete CORBAcompliant Object Request Brokers such as Orbix and VisiBroker. The presented techniques and examples are useful to systematically evaluate whether a given CORBA ORB can be used to implement a load balancing method as required by the application. 1...|$|E

30|$|SWAT {{model was}} {{appraised}} to {{be a fair}} model for water-balance study in the agricultural dominated sub basins. Due to unavailability of the observed runoff data, {{the performance of the}} model was evaluated using observed PET. The results of SWAT model revealed that the SWAT model does not require much calibration and can be used in predicting the water <b>balancing</b> <b>components</b> of the study area. The SWAT model was applied to analyze seasonal and annual water budget for Semrakalwana village and Semra watershed. Water balancing analysis of Semrakalwana village was performed on HRU basis. The average annual rainfall and runoff was found to be nearly 1065 and 383  mm, respectively. The evapotranspiration of the village was found to be approximately 362  mm. The average annual percolation and return flow was found to be approximately 270 and 147 – 255  mm, respectively. The initial soil water content of the village was found in the range of 328 – 335  mm while the final soil water content was 356 – 362  mm. The water balancing analysis was also performed on seasonal (Kharif, Rabi and Zaid seasons) as well as on yearly basis. The seasonal hydrological assessment exhibited that about 50 % of annual rainfall (1066.8  mm) occurs during Kharif season. In the Rabi season which is lean season, rainfall was found to be 197.1  mm and during the season of Zaid the rainfall was about 341  mm. The water yield (water that leaves the sub basin and contributes to stream flow) in Kharif season was almost 46 % of the annual water yield. In the Rabi season it was found to be lowest with 148.72  mm while in the season of Zaid it was found to be 231.1  mm. ET contribution in the Kharif season was found to be 46.51 % (151.69) of yearly ET. In the Rabi and Zaid seasons ET was found to be 78.96 and 95.99  mm, respectively. The yearly water balance revealed that out of 1066.8  mm annual average rainfall, 421.88  mm flows out as surface runoff. The annual average water yield was 705.65  mm and the average annual ET of the study area was found to be 326.1  mm.|$|E

40|$|Quantification of {{the changes}} of water <b>balance</b> <b>components</b> is {{significant}} for water resource assessment and management. This paper employed the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to estimate the water balance in a mountainous watershed in northwest China at different spatial scales over the past half century. The results showed that both Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and determination coefficient (R 2) were over 0. 90 for the calibration and validation periods. The water <b>balance</b> <b>components</b> presented rising trends at the watershed scale, and the total runoff increased by 30. 5 % during 1964 to 2013 period. Rising surface runoff and rising groundwater flow contributed 42. 7 % and 57. 3 % of the total rising runoff, respectively. The runoff coefficient was sensitive to increasing precipitation and was not significant to the increase of temperature. The alpine meadow was the main landscape which occupied 51. 1 % of the watershed and contributed 55. 5 % of the total runoff. Grass land, forest land, bare land, and glacier covered 14. 2 %, 18. 8 %, 15. 4 %, and 0. 5 % of the watershed and contributed 8. 5 %, 16. 9 %, 15. 9 %, and 3. 2 % of the total runoff, respectively. The elevation zone from 3500 to 4500 m occupied 66. 5 % of the watershed area, and contributed {{the majority of the}} total runoff (70. 7 %). The runoff coefficients in the elevation zone from 1637 to 2800 m, 2800 to 3500 m, 3500 to 4000 m, 4000 to 4500 m, and 4500 to 5062 m were 0. 20, 0. 27, 0. 32, 0. 43, and 0. 78, respectively, which tend to be larger along with the elevation increase.

40|$|Vegetation {{has a major}} {{influence}} on the water and energy balance of the earth's surface. In the last century, human activities have modified land use, inducing a consequent change in albedo and potential evapotranspiration. Linear vegetation structures (hedgerows, shelterbelts, open woodland, etc) were particularly abundant but have declined considerably over the past several decades. In this context, it is important to quantify their effect on water and energy balance both on a global scale (climate change and weather prediction) and on a local scale (soil column, hillslope and watershed). The main objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the effect of hedgerows on the water cycle by evaluating spatial and temporal variations of water <b>balance</b> <b>components</b> of a hillslope crossed by a hedgerow. Water flow simulation was performed using Hydrus- 2 D to emphasize the importance of transpiration in the water balance and to evaluate water extraction from groundwater. Model validation was performed by comparing simulated and observed soil matrix potentials and groundwater levels. Hedgerow transpiration was calculated from sap flow measurements of four trees. Water <b>balance</b> <b>components</b> calculated with a one-dimensional water balance equation were compared with simulations. Simulation runs with and without tree root uptake underlined the effect of hedgerow transpiration, increasing capillary rise and decreasing drainage. Results demonstrated that the spatial and temporal variability of water <b>balance</b> <b>components</b> was related to the hedgerow presence as well as to the meteorological context. The relations between transpiration, groundwater proximity and soil-water availability determined the way in which water <b>balance</b> <b>components</b> were affected. Increased capillary rise and decreased drainage near hedges were related to the high transpiration of trees identified in this study. Transpiration reached twice the potential evapotranspiration when groundwater level and precipitation amounts were high. Water balance analysis showed that transpiration was a substantial component, representing 40 % of total water output. These results may offer support for improving hydrological models by including the effect of land use and land cover on hydrological processes...|$|R

The field experiment was carried out in Piracicaba, State of São Paulo, Brazil, on a Typic Hapludox. Evaluations were made in the 2004 / 2005 and 2005 / 2006 corn cropping seasons, divided over three stages according to the plant's phenology. Runoff was not taken into account.

Corn grain yield was evaluated as well. In general, the soil water <b>balance</b> <b>components</b> were modified by N doses, because the soil had been relatively smaller &# 916;h in treatments involving N application than in the treatment without N, resulting in smaller D values in those treatments, which resulted in greater absorption by the plants and greater ET.

Values of ET in the North region of Minas Gerais state were estimated in this research from the multispectral images data of the Landsat 5 TM satellite by means of the model Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land- SEBAL, based on the simplified energy balance equation of a surface covered by vegetation, using a few daily surface climatological parameters (wind speed, rainfall, air temperature and relative humidity, solar radiation).
