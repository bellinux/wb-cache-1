5|$|ZANU-PF won a {{landslide}} victory, with 61% {{of the presidential}} vote and over two-thirds of parliamentary seats. The elections were not considered free and fair; there were widespread stories of vote rigging and many voters may have been fearful of the violence that had surrounded the 2008 election. During the campaign, many MDC supporters had remained quiet about their views {{out of fear of}} reprisals. The MDC was also negatively impacted by its time in coalition government, with perceptions that it had <b>been</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> corrupt as ZANU-PF. ZANU-PF had also capitalised on its appeals to African race, land, and liberation, while the MDC was often associated with white farmers, Western nations, and perceived Western values such as LGBT rights.|$|E

Soriano also led the team in home runs, despite having played in only 109 games. On August 22, Soriano accomplished one of baseball's rarest feats, as he stole home plate in a loss to his old team, the Washington Nationals.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} {{effects of}} the Marshall Plan may have <b>been</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> important as the economic ones. Marshall Plan aid allowed the nations of Western Europe to relax austerity measures and rationing, reducing discontent and bringing political stability. The communist influence on Western Europe was greatly reduced, and throughout the region communist parties faded in popularity {{in the years after}} the Marshall Plan. The trade relations fostered by the Marshall Plan helped forge the North Atlantic alliance that would persist throughout the Cold War. At the same time, the nonparticipation of the states of the Eastern Bloc {{was one of the first}} clear signs that the continent was now divided.|$|E

The University of Regina Cougars and the University of Saskatchewan Huskies are men's and women's teams which compete in Canadian Interuniversity Sport. The Saskatchewan Huskies men's team made history and won their first ever CIS Championship in the 2009-2010 season under head coach Barry Rawlyk. Three {{members of the}} squad were named CIS Championship Tournament All-Stars, {{one of which was}} also named tournament MVP. The Regina Cougars success has <b>been</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> brief. The Cougars' women's team won the CIS championship in the 2000–01 season. The CIS women's basketball tournament was held in Saskatchewan in March 2008, with the University of Saskatchewan hosting the tournament.|$|E

500|$|Hoshino {{has been}} highly praised for her art, {{which has been}} {{compared}} to the works of Joe Madureira, Kelley Jones, and Chris Bachalo by one reviewer and described as [...] "some of the best artwork in the business" [...] by another. Her character designs received many positive comments ranging from [...] "especially lovely" [...] to [...] "the most visually striking element" [...] of her art and it is said that both male and female readers will enjoy the designs. However, she has <b>been</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> highly criticized for her lack of skill in drawing action scenes, which leads one reviewer to believe she will not or cannot draw physical combat.|$|E
500|$|The King was displeased at Liberal {{attacks on}} the peers, which {{included}} a polemical speech by David Lloyd George at Limehouse. Cabinet minister Winston Churchill publicly demanded a general election, for which Asquith apologised to the King's adviser Lord Knollys and rebuked Churchill at a Cabinet meeting. Edward was so dispirited at the tone of class warfare – although Asquith told him that party rancour had <b>been</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> bad over the First Home Rule Bill in 1886 – that he introduced his son to Secretary of State for War Richard Haldane as [...] "the last King of England". After the King's horse Minoru won the Derby on 26 July 1909, {{he returned to the}} racetrack the following day, and laughed when a man shouted: [...] "Now, King. You've won the Derby.

500|$|The {{reviews for}} Thrilling Cities were broadly good. The critic for The Times thought that Fleming's style was [...] "no {{nonsense}} over fine writing", and {{summed up the}} book as [...] "Fleming's smooth, sophisticated, personally conducted tours", noting that the author [...] "has a knack of enjoying himself". John Raymond, in The Sunday Times, wrote that [...] "Mr Fleming's prose arouses the voyeur that lurks {{in all but the}} best of us", and considered that the book remained [...] "supremely readable" [...] throughout. Writing for The Times Literary Supplement, Xan Fielding found {{the title of the book}} to be misleading, noting that apart from a very small win at the casinos of Las Vegas, [...] "his personal experience of thrills seems to have <b>been</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> limited everywhere else on his itinerary." [...] Fielding considered that the cities Fleming visited had the potential for thrills, and hoped that the material gathered was used in Fleming's literary works with thrills included.|$|E

500|$|Much {{comparison}} {{has been}} made of Hale with Edward Coke. Campbell considered Hale to be the superior lawyer, because while he failed to engage in public life he treated law as a science, and maintained judicial independence and neutrality. Hostettler, while considering Hale a better lawyer than Coke and more influential, says that Coke was better overall. While Hale was in possession of judicial impartiality, and his written works are considered highly important, his lack of venture into public affairs limited his progressive influence. Coke's active intervention allowed him to [...] "breath new life into medieval law and use it to oppose conciliar justice", encouraging judges to be more independent and [...] "unfettered except by the common law whose supremacy it was their duty to uphold". J.H. Corbett, writing in the Alberta Law Quarterly, notes that with Hale's popularity at the time (Parliamentary constituencies [...] "fought over the privilege of returning him") he could have <b>been</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> successful as Coke if he had chosen to {{take an active role in}} public affairs.|$|E
500|$|Milford Haven has {{experienced}} a history of boom and slump in shipbuilding, fishing, as a railhead and an ocean terminal. At {{the height of the}} fishing boom, it was said that [...] "every day was a pay day". [...] In 1921, 674 people were identified as working in the fishing industry, the leading occupation in the town, followed by transport and communication [...] with [...] 600 employees. The development of the oil industry also helped to boost the town's fortunes. [...] However, the slumps have <b>been</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> severe, the area being scheduled as 'distressed' in the inter-war period. During the 1980s and 1990s, the unemployment rate at times topped 30%, and the major industry of oil refining created no more than 2,000 direct or indirect jobs. Into the new millennium, its fortunes have risen, as can be witnessed in the activity surrounding the LNG terminal, and the new building works which accompanied it and its connection to the controversial South Wales Gas Pipeline. In February 2003, Pembrokeshire Council granted outline planning permission to Petroplus for an LNG storage depot at Waterston, and in March 2004, an additional site was approved at South Hook for ExxonMobil.|$|E
500|$|Critics of Pericles' strategy, however, have <b>been</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> {{numerous}} as its supporters. A common {{criticism is}} that Pericles {{was always a}} better politician and orator than strategist. Donald Kagan called the Periclean strategy [...] "a form of wishful thinking that failed", Barry S. Strauss and Josiah Ober have stated that [...] "as strategist he was a failure and deserves {{a share of the}} blame for Athens' great defeat", and Victor Davis Hanson believes that Pericles had not worked out a clear strategy for an effective offensive action that could possibly force Thebes or Sparta to stop the war. Kagan criticizes the Periclean strategy on four counts: first that by rejecting minor concessions it brought about war; second, that it was unforeseen by the enemy and hence lacked credibility; third, that it was too feeble to exploit any opportunities; and fourth, that it depended on Pericles for its execution and thus was bound to be abandoned after his death. Kagan estimates Pericles' expenditure on his military strategy in the Peloponnesian War to be about 2,000 talents annually, and based on this figure concludes that he would only have enough money to keep the war going for three years. [...] He asserts that since Pericles must have known about these limitations he probably planned for a much shorter war. Others, such as Donald W. Knight, conclude that the strategy was too defensive and would not succeed.|$|E

500|$|During {{the time}} Hoffman held the career record for saves, many still {{considered}} Rivera the best closer of all time. Like many other relievers of his era, Hoffman {{was compared to}} Rivera and his success in the playoffs. While Hoffman had 601 regular-season saves, he only had four in the playoffs. Jayson Stark of ESPN wrote after Hoffman's retirement announcement, [...] "Not everybody can have his team deliver him an October save opportunity to protect 47 different times." [...] His last postseason save was in 2006, which was also his first postseason save in eight years. [...] Though the Padres were in the playoffs three other times in that span, they never took a single lead. Hoffman, however, did blow a save opportunity in his only World Series appearance and also failed on save tries twice in the final three days of the 2007 season as the Padres vied for the playoffs. John Delcos of The Journal News, who covered the New York Yankees for eight years, believes the Yankees would have <b>been</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> successful with Hoffman instead of Rivera. David Wells, who played with both Hoffman and Rivera, said, [...] " [...] has the better postseason record because the Yankees go to the postseason more than the Padres do, and he's had more opportunities there. The way they go about it, they're {{the best in the}} game. Trevor's the best in the West and [...] {{is the best in the}} East." [...] Rivera, however, broke Hoffman's career save record in 2011.|$|E
500|$|As the wet {{season ended}} in early 1852, Seacole joined other traders in Cruces in packing up {{to move to}} Gorgona. She records a white American giving a speech at a leaving dinner in which he wished that [...] "God bless the best yaller woman he ever made" [...] and asked the {{listeners}} to join with him in rejoicing that [...] "she's so many shades removed from being entirely black". He {{went on to say}} that [...] "if we could bleach her by any means we would and thus make her acceptable in any company as she deserves to be". Seacole replied firmly that she did not [...] "appreciate your friend's kind wishes with respect to my complexion. If it had been as dark as any nigger's, I should have <b>been</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> happy and just as useful, and as much respected by those whose respect I value." [...] She declined the offer of [...] "bleaching" [...] and drank [...] "to you and the general reformation of American manners". Salih notes the use of American pidgin, against Seacole's clear English, as representational of a supposed white moral and intellectual superiority. Seacole also comments on the positions of responsibility taken on by escaped American slaves in Panama, as well as in the priesthood, the army, and public offices, commenting that [...] "it is wonderful to see how freedom and equality elevate men". She also records an antipathy between Panamanians and Americans, which she attributes in part to the fact that so many of the former had once been slaves of the latter.|$|E
500|$|After departing North Carolina, the {{hurricane}} tracked through southern Virginia, {{where it was}} described as [...] "a severe gale which continued for three days changed the climate here entirely..." [...] Thanks to a subsiding tide, damage along the coastline of Virginia {{was not nearly as}} severe as the 1821 Norfolk and Long Island hurricane, although winds were said to have <b>been</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> intense. Still, fodder was rendered useless, and many corn crops were damaged. A two-story building on Talbot Street in Norfolk had its second floor carried downwind, numerous cattle were swept away, and a mill dam was completely destroyed, with the bridge above it removed in the process. In Nansemond County, fruit trees were severely damaged. Along the James River, the low-grounds were completely submerged; crops along the waterway were also ruined. A brick building was destroyed, a team boat was sunk at its wharf, and some ships at the Navy Yard were ripped from their fasts but otherwise sustained no damage. The schooner Albion was gravely injured when nearly all of its sails were blown away, when it lost its main, jib-boom, and fore-top mast, and when all objects were swept off the ship's deck, including the caboose. Two crew members sustained injuries. Around Hampton, the pilot boats James Barron, Virginia and Mary Ann were both run aground. In Gloucester County, corn crops were damaged. The sloop Flag was capsized on the Middle Ground of the Chesapeake River with no survivors. The brig Liberty from Boston ran aground {{on the south side of}} Portsmouth, while the schooner Mulberry sustained severe damage; passengers overthrew cargo to prevent the ship from sinking. As far north as Baltimore, it is said [...] "considerable mischief" [...] was inflicted by {{the hurricane}}. In New York City, two vessels were pushed ashore while two pleasure boats were overturned along the East River. Heavy rainfall and gale-force winds were recorded throughout Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Cape Cod.|$|E
