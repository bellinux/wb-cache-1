5000|$|Balenciaga (...) is a French luxury fashion house {{founded by}} Cristóbal Balenciaga, a Spanish designer, {{born in the}} Basque Country, Spain. He had a {{reputation}} as a couturier of uncompromising standards and was referred to as [...] "the master of us all" [...] by Christian Dior. His <b>bubble</b> <b>skirts</b> and odd, feminine, yet ultra-modern shapes were trademarks of the house. The House of Balenciaga is now owned by the French multinational company Kering.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{application}} of Level Set method in modeling incompressible immiscible two-phase flows for some benchmark {{problems such as}} rising bubble and bursting bubble at the free surface is explained. Derivations of Level Set function and con- vective terms are done using fifth order Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme. It is observed that Level Set method is very successful in modeling two-phase flows, especially in handling topological changes like <b>bubble</b> <b>skirt</b> pinching off and merging of bubble with the free surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a bubble, initially stationary and spherical, rising in a viscous Newtonian liquid {{have been studied}} numerically using 3 -D Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method implemented in the Gerris flow solver. The study encompasses 8. 7 ≤ Eo (=ΔρgD²/σ) ≤ 641 and Re ≤ 151. Additionally, results published in the literature encompassing bubbles with lower values of Eo numbers were also considered, such that the overall dependencies of bubble shape, wake characteristics, and drag coefficient over a large range of Eo and Re values can be identified. While {{it was found that}} the deformation of the bubbles as predicted through the numerical study can generally replicate experimental observations presented, several limitations were identified, such as in the representation of skirt formation behind a <b>skirted</b> <b>bubble</b> and the formation of satellite bubbles behind a bubble rising at high Reynolds numbers. The dependency of the bubble aspect ratio on the Weber and Morton numbers was confirmed for cases of spherical and ellipsoidal bubbles; whilst for spherical cap and <b>skirted</b> <b>bubbles</b> the aspect ratio was found to depend largely on the Reynolds and Capillary numbers, respectively. Finally, the expansion and formation of closed/open laminar wakes behind the rising bubble were analysed and was found to correlate well with the bubble Re and Eo numbers...|$|R
60|$|They went up {{the creek}} in the little, clanking launch, eight limp and perspiring white men, with knives and iron bars, under a {{scorching}} sun that burned through their oil-stained garments. They slid through strips of shadow where the belts of mire they <b>skirted</b> <b>bubbled</b> with the emanations the heat sucked up from them, and slid across lake-like reaches where the yellow water was dazzling to look upon. All the time, endless ranks of mangroves crawled past them, {{and there was no}} sound but the presumptuous clanking of the engine to break the deep silence of the watery forest. The whole land seemed comatose with heat, and all that had its being in it probably was so, for it is at night that nature awakens in the swamps of the fever belt. Man alone was stirring, and the puny noise of his activity jarred for a few moments on the great stillness and then sank into it again.|$|R
40|$|The {{fascinating}} behaviour {{of bubbles}} and drops rising or falling under gravity, {{even without the}} presence of any impurities or other forces (such as electric, magnetic and marangoni forces), is still a subject of active research. Let alone a uni fied description {{of the dynamics of}} bubbles and drops, a full description of a single bubble/drop is out of our reach, as of now. The thin <b>skirted</b> <b>bubbles,</b> for instance, may rise axisymmetrically or may have travelling waves in azimuthal or vertical direction; may or may not remain axisymmetric; may eject satellite bubbles, or they may form wrinkles in their skirt. The length scales may vary across 3 or more orders of magnitude. A rising bubble may change its topology to become a toroidal bubble and become unstable to break into smaller bubbles, which may further break into even smaller bubbles. Bubbles which attain a terminal shape and velocity may change their fi nal behaviour depending on the initial conditions of release. Ellipsoidal bubbles, released axisymmetrically, may often take a zigzag or a spiral path as they rise. On the other hand, drops have a completely di ff erent dynamics. Drops have been studied due to their importance in atomization, rain drop size distribution, emulsi fi cation and many other problems of industrial importance. Apart from the low Reynolds number regime and density ratios close to 1, any literature seldom compares bubbles and drops because of the inherent difference in their dynamics. The reason for this difference has been investigated i...|$|R
