And it's not just <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> 3-for-4, or had a great game. It's just the fact that I represent a lot of Jewish people {{and a lot of the}} Jewish heritage, and the struggles that a lot of our people have had.|$|E

I played a small theater in Seattle, {{and the girls}} had flap skirts on and the tights cut off below their knees and lace gloves and rosaries and bows in their hair and big hoop earrings. I was like, 'This is insane!' After Seattle, all of the shows were moved to arenas. I've never done a bus tour. Everyone says they are really fun." ...|$|E

Newman qualified third, Jeff Gordon took fourth, and Keselowski started fifth. The driver that failed to qualify was Timmy Hill, and Robby Gordon withdrew because of issues with his car's engine. After the qualifier Biffle said, [...] "I got in the gas fairly early [...] and was a little worried about making the rest of the corner, It got loose up off of both ends <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> in the gas so early {{in the middle of the}} corner, just pushing the envelope as much as I could." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'What a {{fool you}} are!' I said, a little angrily. 'You {{seem to think}} that <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> and see a woman I must be dying of love for her. You are absurd.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Well, pursued Mr Toots, 'the {{reason why}} I'm rather late is, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> up {{as far as}} Finchley first, to get some uncommonly fine {{chickweed}} that grows there, for Miss Dombey's bird.
