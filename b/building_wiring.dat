25|$|Copper {{building}} wire {{is compatible}} with brass and quality plated screws. The wire provides connections that will not corrode or creep. It is not, however, compatible with aluminium wire or connectors. If the two metals are joined, a galvanic reaction can occur. Anodic corrosion during the reaction can disintegrate the aluminium. This is why most appliance and electrical equipment manufacturers use copper lead wires for connections to <b>building</b> <b>wiring</b> systems.|$|E
25|$|Fuses {{have the}} {{advantages}} of often being less costly and simpler than a circuit breaker for similar ratings. The blown fuse must be replaced with a new device which is less convenient than simply resetting a breaker and therefore likely to discourage people from ignoring faults. On the other hand, replacing a fuse without isolating the circuit first (most <b>building</b> <b>wiring</b> designs do not provide individual isolation switches for each fuse) can be dangerous in itself, particularly if the fault is a short circuit.|$|E
25|$|So that {{manufacturers}} {{need not}} build, distribute and maintain many similar appliances differing {{only in the}} type of plug fitted, a common strategy is to provide an IEC 60320 inlet on the appliance and a detachable power cord (mains flex lead) to allow connection of the appliance to the socket. The appliance need only to be tested to the power inlet. Some types of appliance require the consumer to also change a switch to adapt to different voltages or frequency. In addition to sockets permanently attached to <b>building</b> <b>wiring,</b> extension cords (extension leads) are used for temporary connections when a socket is not within convenient reach of an appliance's power lead. Portable equipment such as gardening power tools may have a male power inlet compatible with the connector {{at the end of an}} extension cord; this allows one long cord to be shared among several tools, and so saves storage space and cost for the consumer. Multiple small appliances may be connected to sockets on a power strip, which can also include switching, surge voltage and over-current protection; a power strip equipped with different series of plug and sockets can act as an adaptor for imported equipment.|$|E
50|$|Generally, single {{conductor}} <b>building</b> <b>wire</b> in small sizes is solid wire, since the wiring {{is not required}} to be very flexible. <b>Building</b> <b>wire</b> conductors larger than 10 AWG (or about 6 mm²) are stranded for flexibility during installation, but are not sufficiently pliable to use as appliance cord.|$|R

2500|$|... "All-copper" [...] <b>building</b> <b>wiring</b> is a {{term that}} refers to {{buildings}} in which the inside electrical service is carried exclusively over copper wiring. In all-copper homes, copper conductors are used in circuit breaker panels, branch circuit wiring (to outlets, switches, lighting fixtures and the like), and in dedicated branches serving heavy-load appliances (such as ranges, ovens, clothes dryers and air conditioners).|$|E
2500|$|Where the <b>building</b> <b>wiring</b> system {{defines a}} [...] "neutral" [...] {{conductor}} that {{is close to}} earth potential, it is an advantage for appliance designers to preserve that distinction. For example, appliances may ensure single-pole switches interrupt the line side of the circuit, or ensure that screw-base lampholder shells {{are connected to the}} neutral side of the supply, minimizing the chance of contact with live parts. This requires a plug that can only be connected in one way to the socket, so that the energised and neutral conductors are not interchanged. In most designs, such [...] "polarized" [...] plugs cannot be mated with non-polarized sockets. Wiring systems where both circuit conductors have a significant potential with respect to earth do not benefit from polarized plugs.|$|E
2500|$|Ungrounded metal objects {{close to}} {{electric}} field {{sources such as}} neon signs or conductors carrying alternating currents can have measurable voltage levels caused by capacitive coupling. [...] Since voltages detected by high-impedance instruments disappear or become greatly reduced when a low impedance is substituted, the effect is sometimes called [...] phantom voltage (or ghost voltage). The term is often used by electricians, and might be seen, for example, when measuring the voltage at a lighting fixture after removing the bulb. [...] It is not unusual to measure phantom voltages of 50–90 volts when testing the wiring of ordinary 120V circuits with a high-impedance instrument. While the voltage produced may read almost to the full supply voltage, the capacitance or mutual inductance between the wires of <b>building</b> <b>wiring</b> systems is typically quite low and incapable of supplying significant amounts of current.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s {{problems}} and failures related to branch circuit connections for the newer <b>building</b> <b>wire</b> {{made with the}} utility grade AA-1350 alloy aluminum began to surface, resulting in a re-evaluation {{of the use of}} that alloy for <b>building</b> <b>wire</b> and an identification of the need for newer alloys to produce aluminum <b>building</b> <b>wire.</b> The first 8000 series electric conductor alloy, still widely used in some applications, was developed and patented in 1972 by Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA). This alloy, along with AA-8030 (patented by Olin in 1973) and AA-8176 (patented by Southwire in 1975 and 1980) perform mechanically like copper.|$|R
25|$|Copper used in <b>building</b> <b>wire</b> has a {{conductivity}} {{rating of}} 100% IACS or better. Copper <b>building</b> <b>wire</b> requires less insulation {{and can be}} installed in smaller conduits than when lower-conductivity conductors are used. Also, comparatively, more copper wire can fit in a given conduit than conductors with lower conductivities. This greater “wire fill” is a special advantage when a system is rewired or expanded.|$|R
2500|$|Attempts {{to replace}} copper with {{aluminium}} in <b>building</b> <b>wire</b> were curtailed {{in most countries}} when {{it was found that}} aluminium connections gradually loosened due to their inherent slow creep, combined with the high resistivity and heat generation of aluminium oxidation at joints. [...] Spring-loaded contacts have largely alleviated this problem with aluminium conductors in <b>building</b> <b>wire,</b> but some <b>building</b> codes still forbid the use of aluminium.|$|R
2500|$|Ideally, the {{underground}} {{part of the}} assembly should reside {{in an area of}} high ground conductivity. If {{the underground}} cable is able to resist corrosion well, it can be covered in salt to improve its electrical connection with the ground. While the electrical resistance of the lightning conductor between the air terminal and the Earth is of significant concern, the inductive reactance of the conductor could be more important. For this reason, the down conductor route is kept short, and any curves have a large radius. If these measures are not taken, lightning current may arc over a resistive or reactive obstruction that it encounters in the conductor. At the very least, the arc current will damage the lightning conductor and can easily find another conductive path, such as <b>building</b> <b>wiring</b> or plumbing, and cause fires or other disasters. Grounding systems without low resistivity to the ground can still be effective in protecting a structure from lightning damage. When ground soil has poor conductivity, is very shallow, or non-existent, a grounding system can be augmented by adding ground rods, counterpoise (ground ring) conductor, cable radials projecting away from the building, or a concrete building's reinforcing bars can be used for a ground conductor (Ufer ground). These additions, while still not reducing the resistance of the system in some instances, will allow the [...] of the lightning into the earth without damage to the structure.|$|E

5000|$|Aluminum wire, {{which has}} 61% of the {{conductivity}} of copper, {{has been used}} in <b>building</b> <b>wiring</b> for its lower cost. By weight, aluminum has higher conductivity than copper, but it has properties that cause problems when used for <b>building</b> <b>wiring.</b> It can form a resistive oxide within connections that makes wiring terminals heat. Aluminum can [...] "creep", slowly deforming under load, eventually causing device connections to loosen, and also has a different coefficient of thermal expansion compared to materials used for connections. This accelerates the loosening of connections. These effects can be minimized by using wiring devices approved for use with aluminum.|$|E
