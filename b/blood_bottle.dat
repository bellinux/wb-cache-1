Once set up is complete nurses, volunteers and Doctors Arrive on site to get dressed into uniforms. There were normally 6 nurses and 15 volunteers, the Nurses would do their preliminary task while the volunteers would split off into groups. One group would unpack and set up the reception ready to record details of some 200 donors over 6 hours. Another group would set up the canteen can prepare food for after donations.

40|$|International audienceThe recent {{improvements}} of {{the diagnosis}} of invasive mycoses have included the shortening of the species identification time for a rapid adaptation of the antifungal treatment, and the anticipation of the diagnosis thanks to biomarkers. Species identification is now achieved using MALDI-TOF 24 hours earlier than with the previous phenotypic tests. The aim is now to identify directly on positive <b>blood</b> <b>bottle</b> either using MALDI-TOF or molecular methods. The biomarkers are dominated by antigens (mannan, galactomanan, glucan) with available commercial kits. These antigens are mainly used as screening tests in patients at risk of invasive mycoses. Their main limitation is their weak specificity rather than their sensitivity. For circulating DNA, the quantitative real-time PCR format and the publication of recommendations for validation of diagnostic assays suggest they should be implemented soon in a diagnostic strategy...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterial}} genus Bartonella (Rochalimaea) includes emerging human pathogens {{with five}} recognized species. These are fastidious gram-negative bacteria, exhibiting few phenotypic characteristics and whose identification relies upon serotyping, cellular fatty acid analysis, and molecular typing. Most of the isolates {{have been recovered}} from the blood of patients, {{and three of the}} four pathogenic Bartonella species are associated with infectious endocarditis. We performed PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the blood culture bottle supernatant for the routine identification of Bartonella species among fastidious gram-negative bacteria. The amplification of the citrate-synthase gene with primers previously reported (R. L. Regnery, C. L. Spruill, and B. D. Plikaytis, J. Bacteriol. 173 : 1576 - 1589, 1991) yielded a 379 -bp product from Bartonella species and a 382 -bp product for Capnocytophaga ochracea but no product from any of the other 15 genotypically or phenotypically related species tested. We determined the sequences of the citrate-synthase gene-amplified products for Bartonella species and C. ochracea in order to predict the optimal restriction enzyme to be used in RFLP analysis. TaqI and AciI allowed identification of Bartonella species and C. ochracea. We propose that acridine orange and Gram staining, followed by PCR-RFLP analysis of the <b>blood</b> <b>bottle</b> supernatant, be included in the examination of blood samples from patients with suspected infectious endocarditis...|$|E

Successful patient outcomes are diminished by a failure to rapidly diagnose these infections and initiate appropriate therapy. A rapid and reliable diagnostic platform of high sensitivity is needed {{for the management of}} patients with BSIs. The combination of an RNA-dependent nucleic acid sequence-based amplification and molecular beacon (NASBA-MB) detection system in multiplex format was developed to rapidly detect medically important BSI organisms. Probes and primers representing pan-gram-negative, pan-gram-positive, pan-fungal, pan-Candida, and pan-Aspergillus organisms were established utilizing 16 S and 28 S rRNA targets for bacteria and fungi, respectively. Two multiplex panels were developed to rapidly discriminate bacterial or fungal infections at the subkingdom/ genus level with a sensitivity of 1 to 50 genomes. A clinical study was performed to evaluate the accuracy of this platform by evaluating 570 clinical samples from a tertiary-care hospital group using <b>blood</b> <b>bottle</b> samples. The sensitivity, specificity, and Youden’s index values for pan-gram-positive detection and pan-gram-negative detection were 99. 7 %, 100 %, 0. 997 and 98. 6 %, 95. 9 %, 0. 945, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a detectable bacteraemia was produced during non-surgical root canal therapy. METHODS: Thirty patients receiving non-surgical root canal therapy were studied. Three blood samples were taken per patient: pre-operatively, peri-operatively and post-operatively. In addition, a paper point sample was collected from the root canal. The blood samples were cultured by pour plate and <b>blood</b> <b>bottle</b> methods. The isolated organisms were identified by standard techniques. Blood samples were analysed {{for the presence of}} bacterial DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In two cases where the same species of organism was identified in the root canal and the bloodstream, the isolates were typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: By conventional culturing, a detectable bacteraemia was present in 9 (30 %) of the 30 patients who had no positive pre-operative control blood sample. In 7 (23. 3 %) patients, the same species of organism was identified in both the bloodstream and in the paper point sample from the root canal system. Overall, PCR gave lower detection rates compared with conventional culture, with 10 of 90 (11 %) of the blood samples displaying bacterial DNA. PFGE typing was undertaken for two pairs of culture isolates from blood and paper points; these were found to be genetically identical.

40|$|The rapid {{identification}} and antibiotic susceptibility test of bacteria causing bloodstream infections {{are given a}} very high priority by clinical laboratories. In {{an effort to reduce}} the time required for performing antibiotic susceptibility test (AST), we have developed a new method to be applied from positive <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles.</b> The design of method was performed using <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles</b> prepared artificially with five strains which have a known susceptibility. An aliquot of the blood culture was subcultured in the presence of specific antibiotics and bacterial counts were monitored using the Sysmex UF- 1000 i flow cytometer at different times up to 180 min. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis allowed us to find out the cut-off point for differentiating between sensitive and resistant strains to the tested antibiotic. This procedure was then validated against standard commercial methods on a total of 100 positive <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles</b> from patients. First, bacterial identification was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) directly from positive <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles</b> as we have previously reported. Secondly, antibiotic susceptibility test was performed {{in the same way that}} was carried out in artificially prepared <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles.</b> Our results indicate that antibiotic susceptibility test can be determined as early as 120 min since a <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottle</b> is flagged as positive. The essential agreement between our susceptibility test and commercial methods (E-test, MicroScan and Vitek) was 99 %.

40|$|Sepsis is {{a growing}} global {{healthcare}} concern and is related to high morbidity and mortality. Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that the rapid administration of appropriate antimicrobial treatment is crucial for patient survival. Thus, receiving timely and actionable information from the laboratory on identification of the microorganism causing sepsis is crucial for patient management. In today’s routine diagnostics, blood culture is the standard method for diagnosing sepsis and identification of microorganisms is based on sub-culturing the positive <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles.</b> The overall aim of this thesis was to evaluate and improve the use of rapid identification methods in identification of microorganisms directly from <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles.</b> The thesis focused on two methods, FilmArray and MALDI-TOF MS. The present studies showed that the identification of microorganisms from a <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottle</b> by FilmArray and MALDI-TOF MS were ready in 65 min and 30 minutes respectively. The {{most common form of}} sepsis is caused by a single microorganism. In paper 1 we studied the performance of FilmArray in identification of microorganism’s form <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles.</b> The FilmArray could identify the microorganism in 91. 6 % of the <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles.</b> The anaerobic bacteria are not covered by current rapid identification methods including FilmArray. In study 3, we analyzed the performance of MALDI-TOF MS in identification of anaerobic bacteria from four different <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottle</b> types. MALDI-TOF MS could identify anaerobic bacteria in between 75 - 79 % of the different <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottle</b> types. The incidence of detection of polymicrobial growth in <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles</b> is increasing. This is an obvious challenge both for conventional and rapid identification methods. In study 1 and 4 we evaluated the performance of rapid methods in identification of polymicrobial growth directly from <b>blood</b> culture (BC) <b>bottles</b> after positivity. FilmArray correctly identified all microorganisms in 17 / 24 (71 %) and 99 / 115 (86. 1 %) of the BC bottles in study 1 and 4 respectively. In contrast, the present MALDI-TOF MS method showed poor performance and could identify both microorganisms in only 2 / 115 (1. 7 %) <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles.</b> The high analytical performance of the current rapid methods stimulated us to ask the question if we can identify microorganisms from <b>bottles</b> before the <b>blood</b> cultures signals positive. We called this unique approach as semi-culture based identification since the full- term culture is not needed. In study 2, we analyzed the semi-culture based identification by FilmArray and MALDI-TOF MS. We analyzed both simulated and clinical blood cultures with this approach. MALDI- TOF MS failed to identify the microorganisms prior to positivity even in the simulated <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles.</b> Interestingly, FilmArray could identify microorganisms from <b>bottles</b> before the <b>blood</b> cultures signals positive both in simulated and clinical <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles.</b> In simulated samples, the median time to detection (TTD) of growth for the <b>bottles</b> in the <b>blood</b> culture system was 11. 1 h, whereas FilmArray could identify microorganisms after 5 h incubation in the system. In conclusion, the present thesis shows that the FilmArray is a reliable method for identification of microorganisms from positive <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles</b> with mono- as well as polymicrobial growth. The data from the studies showed also {{that it is possible to}} improve the use of rapid identification methods as in the case of semi-culture based identification...|$|R

40|$|From year to year, it is {{important}} to get an overview of the occurrence of causative agents in febrile neutropenic patients to determine the empiric treatment. Thus our aims were to evaluate a four-year period regarding the prevalence of bloodstream infections and the most important causative agents. During this period, 1, 361 patients were treated in our hematology ward because of various hematological disorders. 812 febrile episodes were recorded in 469 patients. At that time, 3, 714 <b>blood</b> culture (BC) <b>bottles</b> were sent for microbiological investigations, 759 of them gave positive signal. From the majority of positive <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles</b> (67. 1 %), Gram-positive bacteria, mainly coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), were grown. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 32. 9 % of the positive <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles,</b> in these cases the leading pathogen was Escherichia coli. The high prevalence of CNS was attributed to mainly contamination, while lower positivity rate for Gram-negative bacteria was {{associated with the use of}} broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic treatment...|$|R
40|$|Mortality for candidemia {{ranges from}} 15 % to 35 %. Current {{guidelines}} recommend inoculating blood into three aerobic and three anaerobic <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles</b> when candidemia is suspected, without {{mention of a}} fungal <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottle.</b> To determine {{the value of the}} BACTEC Myco/F Lytic blood culture media in the diagnosis of fungemia. A two-year retrospective cross-sectional study was performed for patients who had fungemia with submitted BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F (Aer), BACTEC Plus Anaerobic/F (Anaer) or Myco/F Lytic (Myco) <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles.</b> The detection rate of fungemia was 77. 4 % in 93 patients with contemporaneously submitted <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles</b> when limited to only Aer/Anaer culture results. The detection rate improved significantly with the addition of the Myco culture bottle results (p< 0. 0001). A logistic regression model showed that Myco culture bottle submissions were less useful for patients with appropriate anti-fungal therapy administered within 48 hours [OR = 0. 18, 95 % CI = (0. 06, 0. 49), p = 0. 001] and those with fungal growth detected within 48 hours [OR = 0. 33, 95 % CI = (0. 12, 0. 89), p = 0. 001]. Among a subset of patients with concordant blood culture results, those with Myco culture bottles submission allowed earlier fungal detection and speciation by at least one day in 27. 5 % and 25. 0 % of the cases respectively. Our study highlights the importance of a dedicated fungal blood culture when fungemia is clinically suspected. Nearly a quarter of fungemias may be missed if a fungal blood culture is not performed...|$|R
40|$|BacT/Alert FAN <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles</b> {{have been}} shown to enhance the {{recovery}} of bacteria and yeast from blood compared with standard BacT/Alert bottles. It is well established that standard BacT/Alert <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles</b> require no more than 5 days of incubation for the detection of routine bacteria and yeast. It is less clear, however, whether FAN bottles also routinely require 5 days of incubation. To address this question, we recently reviewed the results of 17, 887 blood culture sets collected in FAN <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles</b> at Geisinger Medical Center. Of these cultures, 1, 780 were positive for bacteria or yeast, yielding a total of 1, 242 clinically significant isolates. The numbers of isolates recovered on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were as follows: (values in parentheses are percentages of total significant isolates) : 877 (71 %), 269 (22 %), 65 (5 %), 18 (1 %) and, 13 (1 %), respectively. In total, 97. 5 % of all clinically significant isolates were detected in the first 3 days of incubation. Of the 31 significant isolates detected on day 4 or 5 of incubation, 17 were detected in concurrent blood cultures within the first 3 days of incubation. Chart reviews were conducted for the 13 patients with the remaining 14 isolates detected on day 4 or 5 to determine whether therapy was changed due to this blood culture result. Therapy was changed for only 1 patient. These results suggest that it may not be necessary to routinely incubate FAN <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles</b> for more than 3 days...|$|R

Each PF sample was inoculated both in aerobic and anaerobic <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles</b> (BacT/Alert®, BioMerieux) and subjected to microbiological analysis.|$|R
40|$|A PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PCR-ELISA) was {{developed}} for direct identification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from positive BACTEC <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles.</b> PCR primers were designed to target a 249 bp sequence of the oprI gene in P. aeruginosa. Biotin-labeled probe (PA 3) targeted to the species-specific motif were hybridized to the digoxigenin-labeled amplified products from P. aeruginosa and captured on streptavidin-coated microtiter plates. The specificity of the assay using the PA 3 probe was investigated {{with a range of}} microorganisms, which are commonly isolated from <b>blood</b> culture <b>bottles</b> serving as negative controls. The PCR-ELISA assay was shown to be highly specific for the identification of P. aeruginosa and was 10 -fold more sensitive than an agarose gel-based detection method using the same pair of primers, with a detection limit at 10 fg of template. The PCR-ELISA assay developed in this study is 100 % sensitive and 100 % specific as it correctly identified all 73 positive and 42 negative controls as well as 25 double blind clinical samples. It significantly reduces the time needed for the identification of P. aeruginosa from positive BACTEC <b>blood</b> cultures <b>bottles</b> from 2 - 3 days to 6 - 8 h...|$|R
