5000|$|Chestnut blight fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica) (formerly Endothia parasitica) affects {{chestnut}} trees. The Eastern Asian {{species have}} coevolved with this disease and are moderately to very resistant to it, while the European and North American species, not having {{been exposed to}} it in the past, have little or no resistance. Early in the 20th century, chestnut blight destroyed about four billion American chestnut trees, and reduced the most important tree throughout the East Coast to an insignificant presence. The American chinkapins are also very susceptible to chestnut blight. The European and West Asian chestnuts are susceptible, but less so than the American species. The resistant species (particularly Japanese and Chinese chestnut, but also Seguin's chestnut and Henry's chestnut) have been used in breeding programs in the U.S. to create hybrids with the American chestnut that are also disease-resistant. The <b>bark</b> <b>miner</b> Spulerina simploniella (Lepidoptera: Gracilariidae) was found in intensively managed chestnut coppices in Greece, but not in orchards. The larvae (and the rain) may be agents in the spread of the disease. They mine under the thin periderm of young trees up to 10 years old, while the stem bark is still smooth. Rain during the pupation period (around the last week of May and first two weeks of June), and the actions of the larvae, may collude for conidiospores to come into contact with the freshly exposed phloem, and thus cause cankers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1870, non-natives began grazing cattle on {{the tall}} grasses that {{grew in the}} park. In 1888, a gang of cattle rustlers moved into the region near the Oasis of Mara. Led by {{brothers}} James. B. and William S. McHaney, they hid stolen cattle in a box canyon at Cow Camp. Throughout the region, ranchers dug wells and built rainwater catchments called [...] "tanks" [...] such White Tank and Barker Dam. [...] In 1900, C. O. <b>Barker,</b> a <b>miner</b> and cattleman, built the original Barker Dam, later improved by William [...] "Bill" [...] Keys, a rancher. Grazing continued in the park through 1945. Barker Dam {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1975.|$|R
5000|$|The larvae feed on Nothofagus dombeyi. They bore {{into the}} leaf {{and from there}} through the petiole into the {{supporting}} branch, eventually reaching the main trunk. There it continues to mine the cambium layer, creating a sinuate [...] "zig-zag" [...] trail down the trunk. The mines are the longest of any known <b>bark</b> or stem <b>miner,</b> ranging to seven meters with a maximum width of 2.4 mm. At times they may extend {{all the way down}} the trunk to the roots.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, Interlake {{disposed}} {{of a large}} number of its smaller ships and built three 1000 ft long Great Lakes freighters: the James R. <b>Barker,</b> the Mesabi <b>Miner,</b> and the William De Lancey. In 1973, Elton Hoyt III was named president and chief executive officer of Pickands Mather, a position he held until his retirement in 1983. Continuing downward price pressure on commodities and shipping rates significantly harmed Pickands Mather's revenues in the 1970s and 1980s. In July 1986, LTV Steel (the successor company to the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company and Republic Steel) filed for bankruptcy, citing $4 billion in debt. The economic shock to the Pickands Mather's iron and coal investments caused by the default of one of the largest consumers of its products deeply alarmed Moore-McCormack Resources (the successor to the Moore-McCormack Company). Moore-McCormack sold the iron and coal mining businesses of Pickands Mather to Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. in November 1986 for an undisclosed sum. The price was later revealed to be 2 million barrels of oil and natural gas reserves owned by Cleveland-Cliffs.|$|R
