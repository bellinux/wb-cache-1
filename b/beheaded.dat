5|$|Almost 100 {{people were}} <b>beheaded</b> in Halifax {{between the first}} {{recorded}} execution in 1286 and the last in 1650, but as {{the date of the}} gibbet's installation is uncertain, it cannot be determined with any accuracy how many were dealt with by the Halifax Gibbet. By 1650 public opinion considered beheading to be an excessively severe punishment for petty theft; use of the gibbet was forbidden by Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, and the structure was dismantled. The stone base was rediscovered and preserved in about 1840, and a non-working replica was erected on the site in 1974. The names of 52 people known to have been <b>beheaded</b> by the device are listed on a nearby plaque.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Stephen Strange: The Queen's Physician, {{who is also}} {{a magician}} and alchemist. He allows himself to be <b>beheaded</b> by King James, which {{subsequently}} frees him from the restriction placed upon him by Uatu, the Watcher (namely, that he could not reveal what he knows while still living).|$|E
5|$|In Serbia, Zaharije {{was persuaded}} by the Byzantines to revolt against Simeon. Zaharije was {{supported}} by many Bulgarians exhausted from Simeon's endless campaigns against Byzantium. The Bulgarian emperor sent his troops under Sigrica and Marmais, but they were routed and the two commanders <b>beheaded,</b> which forced Simeon to conclude an armistice with Byzantium in order {{to concentrate on the}} suppression of the uprising. Simeon sent an army led by Časlav Klonimirović in 924 to depose Zaharije. He was successful, as Zaharije fled to Croatia. After this victory, the Serbian nobility was invited to come to Bulgaria and bow to the new Prince. However, he did not appear at the supposed meeting and all of them were <b>beheaded.</b> Bulgaria annexed Serbia directly.|$|E
5|$|Sarah was {{a hairdresser}} in Tottenham {{when she died}} in 2015. Before she met Amin, she was living with a boyfriend, Jesse Gitta; he {{vanished}} {{and it is not}} clear if he was <b>beheaded,</b> or detained after fleeing to Kenya.|$|E
5|$|The three cruisers sailed from Tanjung Priok {{bound for}} Singapore on 18March. That night, all the prisoners on board Tone were <b>beheaded</b> by {{several of the}} cruiser's officers. Mayuzumi watched the killings from the ship's bridge but Mii refused to take part.|$|E
5|$|Whatever its origin, {{the giant}} {{has become an}} {{important}} part of the culture and folklore of Dorset. Some folk stories indicate that the image is an outline of the corpse of a real giant. One story says the giant came from Denmark leading an invasion of the coast, and was <b>beheaded</b> by the people of Cerne Abbas while he slept on the hillside.|$|E
5|$|Æthelberht was put {{to death}} by Offa of Mercia under unclear circumstances; the site of his murder was {{apparently}} the royal vill at Sutton Walls. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, he was <b>beheaded.</b> Mediaeval sources tell how he was taken captive whilst visiting his future Mercian bride Ælfthyth and was then murdered and buried. In Richard of Cirencester's account of the murder, which cannot be substantiated, Offa's evil queen Cynethryth poisoned her husband's mind until he agreed to have his guest killed. Æthelberht was then bound and <b>beheaded</b> by a certain Grimbert and his body was unceremoniously disposed of. The mediaeval historian John Brompton's Chronicon describes how the king's detached head fell off a cart into a ditch where it was found, before it restored a blind man's sight. According to the Chronicon, Ælfthyth subsequently became a recluse at Crowland and her remorseful father founded monasteries, gave land to the Church and travelled {{on a pilgrimage to}} Rome.|$|E
5|$|A {{petition}} {{was presented}} to UK Home Secretary Jack Straw in 1998 asking for the witches to be pardoned, but {{it was decided that}} their convictions should stand. Ten years later another petition was organised in an attempt to obtain pardons for Chattox and Demdike. It followed the Swiss government's pardon earlier that year of Anna Göldi, <b>beheaded</b> in 1782, thought to be the last person in Europe to be executed as a witch.|$|E
5|$|After the {{disappearance}} of Olubei from the scene ca. 1458, no princes are known by name until Isaac in 1465, possibly Olubei's son. Isaac was overthrown in 1475 by his brother Alexander due to his pro-Ottoman stance. His reign was brief, as the Ottoman Empire laid siege and conquered Theodoro itself in December. Alexander {{and his family were}} taken captive to Constantinople, where the prince was <b>beheaded,</b> his son was forcibly converted to Islam, and his wife and daughters became part of the Sultan's harem.|$|E
5|$|Al-Maʿarri is {{controversial}} even today {{as he was}} sceptical of Islam, the dominant religion of the Arab World. In 2013, almost a thousand years after his death, the al-Nusra Front, a branch of al-Qaeda, <b>beheaded</b> a statue of Al-Maʿarri {{during the civil war}} in Syria. The statue had been crafted by the sculptor Fathi Muhammad. The motive behind the beheading is disputed; theories range from {{the fact that he was}} a heretic to the fact that he is believed by some to be related to the Assad family.|$|E
5|$|Al-Maʿarri wrote {{three main}} works that were popular in his time. Among his works are The Tinder Spark, Unnecessary Necessity, and Resalat Al-Ghufran (The Epistle of Forgiveness) {{which may be}} {{considered}} a precursor to Dante's Divine Comedy. Al-Maʿarri never married and {{died at the age}} of 83 in the city where he was born, Maarrat al-Nuʿman. In 2013, a statue of Al-Maʿarri located in his Syrian home town was <b>beheaded</b> by jihadists from the Al-Nusra Front.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attempt to}} capture {{the city for the}} Christians was made by Enrique de Guzmán, Second Count of Niebla. The Seventh Siege of Gibraltar ended in {{disaster}} on 31 August 1436 when a landing led by Enrique resulted in his drowning at the Red Sands along with 40 knights and men-at-arms. His body was retrieved by the Moors, <b>beheaded</b> and displayed in a wicker basket above Gibraltar's Sea Gate for the next 26 years.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth was {{two years}} and eight months old when her mother was <b>beheaded</b> on 19 May 1536, four months after Catherine of Aragon's death from natural causes. Elizabeth was {{declared}} illegitimate and deprived of {{her place in the}} royal succession. Eleven days after Anne Boleyn's execution, Henry married Jane Seymour, who died shortly after the birth of their son, Prince Edward, in 1537. From his birth, Edward was undisputed heir apparent to the throne. Elizabeth was placed in his household and carried the chrisom, or baptismal cloth, at his christening.|$|E
5|$|Henry had Anne {{investigated}} for high treason in April 1536. On 2 May {{she was arrested}} {{and sent to the}} Tower of London, where she was tried before a jury of peers – which included Henry Percy, her former betrothed, and her own uncle, Thomas Howard – and found guilty on 15 May. She was <b>beheaded</b> four days later. Modern historians view the charges against her, which included adultery, incest and plotting to kill the king, as unconvincing. Some say that Anne was accused of witchcraft but the indictments make no mention of this charge.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a new Friday the 13th film which {{restarted}} {{the film}} series continuity was released. In this film, after witnessing his mother being <b>beheaded</b> {{at a young}} age, an adult Jason (Derek Mears) follows in her footsteps and kills anyone who comes to Crystal Lake. Jason subsequently kidnaps a young woman, Whitney Miller (Amanda Righetti), who resembles his mother at a young age. Six weeks after her disappearance, her brother, Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki), comes to look for her. The pair reunite and work together to seemingly kill Jason.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1955, {{the tide}} {{turned against the}} various sects, as Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm of the State of Vietnam and his VNA began to {{consolidate}} their grip on the south. Ba Cụt and his allies were driven into the jungle, and their position was threatened by government offensives. After almost a year of fighting, Ba Cụt was captured. He {{was sentenced to death}} and publicly <b>beheaded</b> in Cần Thơ.|$|E
5|$|Isabella and Mortimer rapidly took {{revenge on}} the former regime. Hugh Despenser the Younger was put on trial, {{declared}} a traitor and sentenced to be disembowelled, castrated and quartered; he was duly executed on 24 November 1326. Edward's former chancellor, Robert Baldock, died in Fleet Prison; the Earl of Arundel was <b>beheaded.</b> Edward's position, however, was problematic; he was still married to Isabella and, in principle, he remained the king, {{but most of the}} new administration had a lot to lose were he to be released and potentially regain power.|$|E
5|$|Oliver Cromwell {{moved to}} the street in 1647, taking up {{residence}} in Wallingford House. Two years later, Charles I was carried through Whitehall {{on the way to}} his trial at Westminster Hall. Whitehall itself was a wide street and had sufficient space for a scaffold to be erected for the King's execution at Banqueting House. He made a brief speech there before being <b>beheaded.</b> Cromwell died at the Palace of Whitehall in 1658.|$|E
5|$|On April 10, 1935, {{five years}} after Wessel's assassination, and {{two years after the}} SA murder of Höhler, two persons accused of being {{involved}} in Wessel's killing were put on trial and subsequently <b>beheaded</b> in Berlin's Plotzensee Prison: Sally Epstein, a Jewish painter, and Hans Ziegler, a barber. The two had been arrested in August 1933, and were put on trial in May 1934 with a third defendant, Peter Stoll, a tailor. In 2009 the sentences against all three of them were rescinded by the Berlin public prosecutor's office.|$|E
5|$|The Turks {{took the}} castle {{and most of}} the {{defenders}} were slain. A few of the captured defenders were spared by Janissaries who had admired their courage, with only seven defenders managing to escape through the Ottoman lines. Zrinski's corpse was <b>beheaded</b> and his head taken to the new Sultan while his body received an honourable burial by a Turk who had been his prisoner, and well treated by him.|$|E
5|$|The plot depicts Eddard Stark, imprisoned {{and accused}} of high treason, {{struggling}} with the decision whether to falsely confess to save his daughters, and he is ultimately <b>beheaded</b> by King Joffrey. His wife Catelyn negotiates with Lord Walder Frey {{for the use of}} a strategic river crossing and his son Robb fights his first battle in the war against the Lannisters. Meanwhile, Jon Snow discovers a secret about Maester Aemon, and Daenerys stands up to Qotho and challenges Dothraki traditions to care for Khal Drogo.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} of the {{international}} fantasy series , part of the Highlander franchise, consists of 22 episodes produced between 1993 and 1994. The first episode of the season aired on September 27, 1993 in broadcast syndication and the last aired on May 23, 1994. The series continues to follow the adventures of Duncan MacLeod, a 400-year-old Immortal who can only die if he is <b>beheaded.</b> MacLeod {{is involved in the}} Game, an ongoing battle during which all Immortals have to behead each other until only one is left.|$|E
5|$|When Abdi-Milkutti {{ascended to}} Sidon's throne in 680 BC, he also rebelled against the Assyrians. In response, the Assyrian king Esarhaddon laid siege to the city. Abdi-Milkutti was {{captured}} and <b>beheaded</b> in 677BC after a three-year siege, while his city was destroyed and renamed Kar-Ashur-aha-iddina (the harbor of Esarhaddon). Sidon {{was stripped of}} its territory, which was awarded to BaalI, the king of rival Tyre and loyal vassal to Esarhaddon. BaalI and Esarhaddon signed a treaty in 675 in which Eshmun's name features {{as one of the}} deities invoked as guarantors of the covenant.|$|E
5|$|Zou Ying {{was assassinated}} with a spear by {{his younger brother}} Zou Yushan, who plotted against the ruler with the royal family and prime minister. Ying <b>beheaded</b> the corpse and gave the head to a messenger, who {{delivered}} it to Wang {{as a sign of}} Minyue's surrender. After the assassination, Minyue was succeeded by a state divided into a dual monarchy composed of the kingdom of Minyue, controlled by a Han proxy ruler, and the kingdom of Dongyue, ruled by Zou Yushan.|$|E
5|$|An oral legend {{tells how}} the goddess Prachanda-Chandika {{appeared}} {{to aid the}} gods in the god-demon war, when the gods prayed to the Great Goddess Mahashakti. After slaying all demons, the enraged goddess cut off her own head and drank her own blood. The name Prachanda-Chandika also appears as a synonym of Chhinnamasta in her hundred-name hymn in the Shakta Pramoda (19th century). Another oral legend relates her to the Samudra manthan (Churning of the Ocean) episode, where the gods and demons churned the milk ocean to acquire the amrita (the elixir of immortality). Chhinnamasta drank the demons' share of the elixir and then <b>beheaded</b> herself {{to prevent them from}} acquiring it.|$|E
5|$|Another seven internees were {{executed}} by the Japanese authorities. These internees had possessed a radio set which they used to pass messages {{in and out of}} camp. The radio was discovered by the Japanese and the internees were arrested. The other internees were forced to watch their public torture. Military trials were subsequently held and on 29 October 1943, some of the internees {{were executed}} by being shot and at least one, John Fraser, was <b>beheaded.</b> Aside from this, the Japanese authorities had executed by decapitation, three Chinese policemen for bringing cigarettes and tobacco to the camp's internees.|$|E
5|$|As soon as Bahadur Shah came to {{know about}} his brother's death, he sent men to {{retrieve}} the corpse. They were attacked by Wala-Jah, but Wala-Jah fainted and died. Around 8 o'clock in the evening, Bahadur Shah's aide, Rustam Dil Khan, mounted the dead prince's elephant, <b>beheaded</b> the prince, {{and made his way}} to Bahadur Shah. However, instead of praises, he received reproaches for his action. His elephant was followed by two other elephants; the first one contained the dead body of Ali Tabar, the other one carried the dead princes' women, who were assured protection by Bahadur Shah.|$|E
5|$|By 1547, {{opposition}} to Calvin and other French refugee ministers {{had grown to}} constitute {{the majority of the}} syndics, the civil magistrates of Geneva. On 27 June an unsigned threatening letter in Genevan dialect was found at the pulpit of St. Pierre Cathedral where Calvin preached. Suspecting a plot against both the church and the state, the council appointed a commission to investigate. Jacques Gruet, a Genevan member of Favre's group, was arrested and incriminating evidence was found when his house was searched. Under torture, he confessed to several crimes including writing the letter left in the pulpit which threatened the church leaders. A civil court condemned Gruet to death and he was <b>beheaded</b> on 26 July. Calvin was not opposed to the civil court's decision.|$|E
5|$|Chépart {{himself was}} taken captive by the Natchez, {{who were at}} first unsure {{what to do with}} him, but finally decided that he should be killed by a stinkard—a member of the lowest caste in the tribe's hierarchy. The Natchez kept two Frenchmen alive, a carter named Mayeux who was made to carry all the goods of the French to the Great Village, and a tailor named Le Beau who was {{employed}} by the Natchez to refit the colonists' clothing to new owners. They set fire to the fort, the store, and all the homesteads, burning them to the ground. Just as Governor Bienville had done with the executed Indians in 1717 and 1723, the Natchez <b>beheaded</b> the dead Frenchmen and brought the severed heads for the Great Sun to view.|$|E
5|$|Due to her insatiable {{desire for}} wealth, Nagamma {{forcibly}} sends Malliswari to the palace, and, when Nagaraju returns {{on the same}} night and learns what has happened, he becomes depressed. Govindamma become unstable after Nagaraju begins to lead the life of a recluse, mulling over his memories of Malliswari. A group of sculptors meet Nagaraju and ask him to accompany them to Vijayanagara to build a special mandapa for dancers, and he agrees. There, he meets Malliswari. They are separated by her maid Jalaja, who is afraid that they will be <b>beheaded,</b> as stipulated in the Rani Vasam tradition. Knowing about her past, Jalaja arranges a meeting of Malliswari with Nagaraju {{on the banks of the}} Tungabhadra river at midnight.|$|E
5|$|Following Wyatt's rebellion, Guildford Dudley was <b>beheaded</b> on 12 February 1554 {{shortly before}} his wife. Knowing the Queen's character, in June 1554 Jane Dudley pleaded with the {{authorities}} to allow her remaining sons to hear mass. During 1554 the Duchess and her son-in-law Henry Sidney worked hard pleading with the Spanish nobles around England's new king consort, Philip of Spain. Lord Paget may also have proved helpful, and Henry Sidney even travelled to Spain in their cause. In the autumn of 1554 the Dudley brothers were released from the Tower, though the eldest, John, died immediately afterwards at Sidney's house Penshurst in Kent. At the same location Philip Sidney was born on 30 November 1554. His godmother was his grandmother Jane Dudley, while his godfather was Philip of Spain.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{the eighth}} century, Mercia was {{dominant}} among the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms south of the river Humber. Æthelbald, {{who came to the}} throne in 716, had established himself as the overlord of the southern Anglo-Saxons by 731. He was assassinated in 757, and was briefly succeeded by Beornred, but within a year Offa ousted Beornred and took the throne for himself. Offa's daughter Eadburh married Beorhtric of Wessex in 789, and Beorhtric became an ally thereafter. In Kent, Offa intervened decisively in the 780s, and at some point became the overlord of East Anglia, whose king, Æthelred, was <b>beheaded</b> at Offa's orders in 794.|$|E
