5|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice {{signs in the}} first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> in early childhood, typically before age three.|$|E

5|$|By 1906, erosion had <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> at {{the base}} of the tree. George Foster Peabody paid to have new soil, a {{commemorative}} tablet, and a chain barricade supported by eight granite posts installed around the tree. Despite these efforts, the tree reportedly suffered heavy damage during an ice storm in 1907. Although attempts were made at preservation, rot had already set in, and the tree was permanently weakened.|$|E
5|$|Internally, the wiping policy officially {{came to an}} end in 1978, {{when the}} means to further exploit {{programmes}} by taking advantage of the new market for home videocassette recordings started to <b>become</b> <b>apparent.</b> The prevailing view had also begun to shift toward the attitude that archive programmes should, in any case, be preserved for posterity and historical and cultural reasons.|$|E
5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E

5|$|Christie {{urged the}} Navy Department to {{allocate}} a target ship for extensive field {{tests of the}} torpedo and exploder. The Chief of Naval Operations authorized {{the use of the}} obsolete destroyer , but placed so many restrictions on its use, Newport was forced to decline the offer. As a result, neither the Mark 6 exploder nor the Mark 14 torpedo ever underwent a live test, and their shortcomings would not <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> until the outbreak of hostilities. It would be twenty months before the problems were corrected, over Christie's objections.|$|E
5|$|HIV/AIDS is {{diagnosed}} via laboratory testing and then staged {{based on the}} presence of certain signs or symptoms. HIV screening is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force for all people 15years to 65years of age including all pregnant women. Additionally, testing is recommended for those at high risk, which includes anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted illness. In many areas of the world, a third of HIV carriers only discover they are infected at an advanced stage of the disease when AIDS or severe immunodeficiency has <b>become</b> <b>apparent.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, a {{burst of}} intense neutron and gamma {{radiation}} came directly from the fireball. Its lethal radius was , covering {{about half of the}} firestorm area. An estimated 30% of immediate fatalities were people who received lethal doses of this direct radiation, but died in the firestorm before their radiation injuries would have <b>become</b> <b>apparent.</b> Over 6,000 people survived the blast and fire, but died of radiation injuries. Among injured survivors, 30% had radiation injuries from which they recovered, but with a lifelong increase in cancer risk. To date, no radiation-related evidence of heritable diseases has been observed among the survivors' children.|$|E

5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the Non-Intervention Committee was created to uphold the agreement, but the double-dealing of the USSR and Germany had already <b>become</b> <b>apparent.</b> It also removed the need for a {{declaration}} of neutrality (which would have granted the Nationalists and Republicans control over neutrals in the areas they controlled), and had little legal standing. In Britain, part of the reasoning was based on an exaggerated belief in Germany's and Italy's preparedness for war.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{take time to}} develop, {{and as many as}} half of cases are asymptomatic at the initial presentation. The more severe the injury, the more quickly symptoms <b>become</b> <b>apparent.</b> In severe cases, symptoms may occur as quickly as three or fourhours after the trauma. Hypoxemia (low oxygen concentration in the arterial blood) typically becomes progressively worse over 24–48hours after injury. In general, pulmonary contusion tends to worsen slowly over a few days, but it may also cause rapid deterioration or death if untreated.|$|E

5|$|After {{depositing}} {{his family}} in a London hotel, the Claimant called at Lady Tichborne's address and was told she was in Paris. He then went to Wapping in East London, where he enquired after a local family named Orton. Finding that they had left the area, he identified himself to a neighbour {{as a friend of}} Arthur Orton, who, he said, was now one of the wealthiest men in Australia. The significance of the Wapping visit would <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> only later. On 29 December the Claimant visited Alresford and stayed at the Swan Hotel, where the landlord detected a resemblance to the Tichbornes. The Claimant confided that he was the missing Sir Roger but asked that this be kept secret. He also sought information concerning the Tichborne family.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the Gulf of California, an eye began to <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> on visible satellite imagery, {{and it is}} estimated Isis attained hurricane status late on September 2. Continuing northward, it struck Topolobampo {{in the state of}} Sinaloa early on September 3 as a minimal hurricane. Isis weakened to a tropical storm a few hours after landfall, and subsequent to turning to the north-northwest the low-level circulation dissipated over Sierra Madre Occidental. The remnants entered southern Arizona on September 4 and tracked around an upper-level low. After entering Nevada on September 5, the remnants of Isis passed into Oregon before dissipating in Idaho on September 8.|$|E
5|$|After {{moderate}} {{sales of}} their debut album Cheshire Cat (1995), released on independent record label Cargo Music, Blink-182 enjoyed {{a small amount}} of success. Throughout 1994 and 1995, the trio vigorously toured nonstop and grew in popularity, mostly in Australia, where audiences embraced the band's irreverent sense of humor and stage shows. When the trio grew frustrated when fans lamented the inability to purchase Cheshire Cat at their respective local record stores, they began to turn toward other record labels to achieve wider distribution than Cargo. By the end of 1995, problems had <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> between the trio and the label, who regarded the band as a joke not to be taken seriously.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the opening}} of Melbourne Airport, Melbourne's main airport was Essendon Airport which was officially {{designated}} an international airport in 1950. In the mid-1950s, over 10,000 passengers were using Essendon Airport and the limitations of Essendon Airport were beginning to <b>become</b> <b>apparent.</b> Essendon Airport's facilities were insufficient to meet the increasing demand for air travel; the runways were too short to handle the then new jet airliners and the terminals failed to handle the increase in passengers, by the mid-1950s, an international overflow terminal was built in a new northern hangar. Due to the encroachment of the urban boundary, the airport had become surrounded by residential housing, meaning that expansion of Essendon Airport was not possible.|$|E
5|$|Despite his successes, al-Mu'tadid's reign was {{ultimately}} {{too short to}} effect a lasting reversal of the Caliphate's fortunes, and the revival that he spearheaded was too dependent {{on the presence of}} capable personalities {{at the helm of the}} state. The brief reign of his less able son and heir, al-Muktafi, still saw some major gains, notably the annexation of the Tulunid domains, but his later successors lacked his energy, and new enemies appeared in the form of the Qarmatians. In addition, the factionalism within the bureaucracy, that had <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> during the later years of al-Mu'tadid's reign, would debilitate the Abbasid government for decades to come, eventually leading to the subjugation of the Caliphate to a series of military strongmen and culminating in the conquest of Baghdad by the Buyids in 946.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, {{in the face}} of the {{emerging}} Cold War scenario, the RAF came to recognise that it would urgently require the development and procurement of fighters equipped with features such as swept wings. By this time, it had also <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> that newly developed jet propulsion would form the future of fighter aircraft development. Many companies were quick to devise their own designs to harness this means of propulsion. Hawker Aviation's chief designer, Sydney Camm, had proposed the Hawker P.1040 for the RAF, but the demonstrator failed to interest them. Further modifications to the basic design resulted in the Hawker Sea Hawk carrier-based fighter. However, the Sea Hawk possessed a straight wing and was powered by the Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine, both features that rapidly became obsolete.|$|E
