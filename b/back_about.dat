5|$|A 2008 genetic {{study showed}} {{that some of the}} woolly mammoths that entered North America through the Bering land bridge from Asia {{migrated}} <b>back</b> <b>about</b> 300,000 years ago and had replaced the previous Asian population by about 40,000 years ago, not long before the entire species became extinct. Fossils of woolly mammoths and Columbian mammoths have been found together in a few localities of North America, including the Hot Springs sinkhole of South Dakota where their regions overlapped. It is unknown whether the two species were sympatric and lived there simultaneously, or if the woolly mammoths may have entered these southern areas during times when Columbian mammoth populations were absent there.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} fossils {{dating back}} some {{two and a}} half million years ago are common and widespread. They have been found in the fossil bearing caves at the Cradle of Humankind north of Johannesburg. Elsewhere in South Africa they are plentiful at such sites as Elandsfontein, Cornelia and Florisbad. The earliest fossils of the black wildebeest were found in sedimentary rock in Cornelia in the Orange Free State and dated <b>back</b> <b>about</b> eight hundred thousand years. Today, five subspecies of the blue wildebeest are recognised while the black wildebeest has no named subspecies.|$|E

5|$|In 2011 archaeologists from Italy, the United States, and Egypt {{excavating}} a dried-up lagoon {{known as}} Mersa Gawasis have unearthed traces {{of an ancient}} harbor that once launched early voyages like Hatshepsut's Punt expedition onto the open ocean. Some of the site's most evocative evidence for the ancient Egyptians' seafaring prowess include large ship timbers and hundreds of feet of ropes, made from papyrus, coiled in huge bundles. And in 2013 a team of Franco-Egyptian archaeologists discovered what {{is believed to be}} the world's oldest port, dating <b>back</b> <b>about</b> 4500 years, from the time of King Cheops on the Red Sea coast near Wadi el-Jarf (about 110 miles south of Suez).|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1980, {{the cost of}} {{building}} the Auburn Dam was estimated at $1 billion. As of 2007, the cost to build the dam would be about $10 billion. Other projects to improve safety margins and spillway capacity of Folsom Dam, and to increase the capacity of levees in the Sacramento area, were projected to cost significantly less while also providing similar levels of flood protection. Also, the United States National Research Council believes that existing stream-flow records, which only date <b>back</b> <b>about</b> 150 years, are insuffient to justify the construction of a dam as large as Auburn. The amount of water supply that Auburn Dam would actually make available was also in question, because while the American River floods in some years, in other years it barely discharges enough water to fill already-existing reservoirs. This casted doubts that Auburn could deliver enough water to justify its own cost, or the completion of Folsom South Canal, the other major feature of the Auburn-Folsom South Unit Project.|$|E
5|$|Features {{necessary}} for defending a territory {{such as the}} horns and broad-based skull of the modern black wildebeest, {{have been found in}} their fossil ancestors. The earliest known fossil remains are in sedimentary rock in Cornelia in the Orange Free State and date <b>back</b> <b>about</b> eight hundred thousand years. Fossils have also been reported from the Vaal River deposits, though it is unclear {{whether or not they are}} as ancient as those found in Cornelia. Horns of the black wildebeest have been found in sand dunes near Hermanus in South Africa. This is far beyond the recorded range of the species and it has been suggested that these animals may have migrated to that region from the Karoo.|$|E

Neolithic horned cairns found on nearby Shebster Hill, which were used for burials and rituals, date <b>back</b> <b>about</b> 5000 years. The town was an important Norse port, and has a later history of trade with ports throughout northern Europe until the 19th century. In 1330 Scotland's standard unit of weight was brought in line with that of Thurso at the decree of King David II of Scotland, {{a measure of the}} town's economic importance. Old St Peter's Kirk is said to date from circa 1220 and the time of Caithness Bishop Gilbert Murray, who died in 1245.|$|E

25|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} in the 1920s produced evidence {{which suggests}} a hill fort {{was built on}} the headland where the castle now stands.

He brought <b>back</b> <b>about</b> 100. Monke was forced to stay on deck day and night, although on the way back to Britain the weather was bad, to forestall any uprising by the rescued sailors. The fear was that the sailors, who were not anxious to be pressed into the Royal Navy, would try to seize Speedwell and run her ashore.|$|E

Paterson, now with a rifle, ran back outside and onto Champ Street. He decided he could not get a clear shot, so he stood on a low wall in the prison's front garden. He aimed his rifle at Ryan, and claimed he fired a shot in the air when a woman came into his line of sight.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{treatments}} {{date back}} to the prehistoric era. The oldest for which there is evidence is trepanation, in which a hole is drilled or scraped into the skull, thus exposing the dura mater in order to treat health problems related to intracranial pressure and other diseases. Prehistoric surgical techniques are seen in Ancient Egypt, where a mandible dated to approximately 2650 BC shows two perforations just below the root of the first molar, indicating the draining of an abscessed tooth. Surgical texts from ancient Egypt date <b>back</b> <b>about</b> 3500 years ago. Surgical operations were performed by priests, specialized in medical treatments similar to today, and used sutures to close wounds. Infections were treated with honey.|$|E
