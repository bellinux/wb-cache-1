60|$|She meant {{him to be}} staggered, and he was. He reeled <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
60|$|We go <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to the {{preceding}} night, {{to account for}} Henchard's attitude.|$|E
60|$|The crew hung <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and in {{that time}} Jerry reached the flying sail.|$|E
60|$|Yates {{released}} his hold {{and everybody in}} the crowd <b>backed</b> away. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> the bronco stood stock-still, his eyes gazing straight ahead. Then he gave a vigorous shake and {{took a few steps}} forward.|$|R
60|$|The lout was {{suddenly}} struck by what I said. He drew <b>back</b> and reflected <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R
60|$|Martin stepped <b>back,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> stood swaying like a {{man about}} to fall. Then, {{recovering}} himself, he leapt at the sword Silence which hung upon the wall and passed its thong over his right wrist. Next he turned towards {{the door of the}} court-room.|$|R
60|$|Captain Jim went out, but remembered {{something}} {{in the yard and}} turned <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
60|$|His eyes fell on {{the figure}} of Buck and he shrank <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in silent surprise.|$|E
60|$|The doctor {{regarded}} his retreating <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{and then}} turned about and went towards his own house....|$|E
60|$|VIVIE. No: I'll be <b>back</b> presently. Only <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> [She {{goes into}} the other room, Praed opening the door for her].|$|R
60|$|There was {{a sullen}} murmur of assent. Quest turned <b>back</b> and whispered <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to the Inspector. Then {{he turned to}} Long Jim.|$|R
60|$|Rows {{of brown}} <b>backs</b> paused <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and then leapt with a motion {{as if they}} were {{springing}} over waves out of sight. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> no one of them could believe that they had really seen live animals in the open--a herd of wild deer, and the sight aroused a childlike excitement in them, dissipating their gloom.|$|R
60|$|She shrank {{a little}} <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> There flashed {{across her face}} a quiver, as though of pain.|$|E
60|$|He {{was evidently}} {{trying to get}} away, whilst she was {{straining}} every nerve to keep him <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two.|$|E
60|$|Letitia stepped <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{to light}} a cigarette. Then she rejoined her father and {{contemplated}} that somewhat grim figure critically.|$|E
5000|$|... 4: Having been {{verbally}} {{hit with}} [...] "fightin' words", Bugs dares Sam to [...] "step over this line" [...] (in a gag {{similar to one}} from Bugs Bunny Rides Again), sending Sam down for the splash again (but not before springing <b>back</b> up <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to declare: [...] "I hate you!") ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Leonard! Oh, dear Leonard!' She lay <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> panting {{under the}} gust of {{exceeding}} joy; {{while he was}} silent, {{and tried not to}} seem to observe her with his anxious eyes. Then she recovered a little and said, 'The truth come out! Did you say so? What was the truth?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Strickland turned <b>back</b> {{the cloth}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and looked. [...] "It is Imray," [...] he said, [...] "and his throat is cut {{from ear to}} ear." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{now we must}} go <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{and read}} the {{correspondence}} which took place between Rachel O'Mahony and Frank Jones. Rachel's letter ran as follows: ...|$|E
6000|$|... [When {{she reaches}} the door she looks <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> at LADY WINDERMERE. Their eyes meet. Then she turns, and exit C. {{followed}} by LORD AUGUSTUS.] ...|$|E
60|$|RAINA. Good-night. (They kiss one another, and Raina's emotion comes <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.)</b> Wish me joy of {{the happiest}} night of my life--if only there are no fugitives.|$|E
60|$|He {{staggered}} <b>back,</b> {{and stood}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> motionless, as though stunned. Then, slowly, a light crept into his little eyes which haunted her <b>for</b> many <b>a</b> day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wonderful {{news came}} today. The British troops {{captured}} Jerusalem yesterday. We {{ran up the}} flag and some of Gertrude's old sparkle came <b>back</b> to her <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{turned his}} <b>back</b> upon her <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{that she might}} not see his face. 'Ah--I do remember,' he said at last, in a dry, small, {{repressed}} voice.|$|R
60|$|Robert Moore held <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> but affection {{struggled}} powerfully, and overcame {{his pride}} and resentment; he rushed towards Prudence, seized her hand, {{and pressed it}} to his bosom.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Duke was right, then," [...] {{he murmured}} a moment later, {{as he stood}} <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> his face {{transformed}} with the new thing that had come into his life.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{seem to be}} just in time, Mr. Hurd," [...] Wilhelmina said. [...] "Do {{you mind}} coming <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> into your study? Mr. Macheson and I have {{something}} to say to you." ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs {{we stand}} on the {{threshold}} of the new Millenium it is worthwhile casting our eyes <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> and acknowledging that we {{have come a long way}} in a very short time. Semiconductors are still really only half a century old. That equates to only 5 % of a Millenium, whereas semiconductors will be the dominant industry of the next...|$|R
6000|$|... "As I {{come from}} your {{stepmother}} now," [...] {{he went on}} with a slight laugh, [...] "I must ask you to go <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> to that point. After your father's death, your mother--I mean your stepmother--recognized {{the fact that your}} mother, the first Mrs. Tretherick, was legally and morally your guardian and, although much against her inclination and affections, placed you again in her charge." ...|$|R
60|$|Benham {{stood at}} the top of the stairs looking down upon them, white-faced and inexpressive. Easton dropped <b>back</b> <b>a</b> pace. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> no one moved nor spoke, and then very quietly Easton shut the half-door and shut out the noises of the road.|$|R
60|$|You have {{no place}} {{whatever}} but your bag or hammock, in which to put anything in a man-of-war. If you lay anything down, and turn your <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> ten to one it is gone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thenks," [...] he, said as an afterthought. The man {{regarded}} his <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{was struck}} with an idea, began an abortive gesture, sighed, gave it up, {{and went on}} also with a depressed countenance.|$|E
60|$|The Englishman glanced <b>back.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{the lean}} figure of Sosra the Egyptian stood {{framed in the}} narrow doorway. The next the door had slammed, and the heavy rasping of a bolt broke on the silent night.|$|E
5000|$|Billy Dukes of Taste of Country {{reviewed}} the song favorably, saying that [...] "A catchy chorus infuses “I Know Somebody” {{with a jolt}} of energy before the second verse brings the roller coaster ride <b>back</b> down <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> There are <b>a</b> few non-organic instruments to be found, {{but this is a}} band that’s long been comfortable stretching the definition of country music. Asking LoCash to rely on banjo and fiddle would be like asking George Strait to wear skinny jeans." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was evident}} to Ida that {{whatever}} {{could be done}} must be done by her, or the man would go away again without a word, {{and this time he}} would, as he had said, not come <b>back</b> at all. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two she sat very still.|$|R
60|$|He had dulled down {{a little}} now; not much, but still you could notice that he hadn't that {{luminous}} {{look in his eyes}} that he had while Satan was in him. He nearly got it <b>back,</b> though, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> when Marget came and praised him and thanked him and couldn't keep him from seeing how proud she was of him. The astrologer went off dissatisfied and cursing, and Solomon Isaacs gathered up the money and carried it away. It was Father Peter's for good and all, now.|$|R
