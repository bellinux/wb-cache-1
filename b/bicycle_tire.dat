Pathology and disease processes {{in these cases}} have been documented cooperatively with veterinary pathologist Gregory Bossart of the Georgia Aquarium and manatee biologist Robert Bonde of the US Geological Survey (USGS) Sirenia Project in Gainesville, Florida. During 2015, two successful rescues were conducted, including one manatee calf in the Condado Lagoon of San Juan with a <b>bicycle</b> <b>tire</b> on its torso and one newborn calf who got separated from its mother {{in the town of}} Isabela.|$|E
25|$|Widely imitated, {{the safety}} bicycle {{completely}} replaced the high-wheeler in North America and Western Europe by 1890. Meanwhile, John Dunlop's reinvention of the pneumatic <b>bicycle</b> <b>tire</b> in 1888 {{had made for}} a much smoother ride on paved streets; the previous type were quite smooth-riding, when used on the dirt roads common at the time. As with the original velocipede, safety bicycles had been much less comfortable than high-wheelers {{precisely because of the}} smaller wheel size, and frames were often buttressed with complicated bicycle suspension spring assemblies. The pneumatic tire made all of these obsolete, and frame designers found a diamond pattern to be the strongest and most efficient design.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance of {{adequate}} tire inflation {{is the most}} frequent and troublesome concern for cyclists and many means and methods are employed to preserve pneumatic integrity. Thicker tires, thicker tubes, tire liners (of a number of rather impenetrable devices installed between the tire and tube), liquid sealing compounds squeezed into the tube, and automotive-style patch kits are all used to reliably contain the typical tire pressures of 40 to 60 {{pounds per square inch}} that are required for bicycle operation. Thin, light bicycle tires are particularly vulnerable to penetration and subsequent deflation caused by goat's heads and other burs, colloquially known as stickers. Inflation of bicycle tires to pressures higher than typical for automotive use requires special pumps. The complexity of <b>bicycle</b> <b>tire</b> maintenance and repair may cause many to not consider the bicycle for transport or leisure.|$|E

500|$|The Workmans' trip to India, Burma, Ceylon, and Java lasted {{two and a}} half years, {{beginning}} in November 1897, and covered [...] At the time, Fanny was 38 and William 50. They bicycled about [...] from the southernmost tip of India to the Himalaya in the north. To ensure they had access to supplies, they rode along major thoroughfares near railways, and were sometimes forced to sleep in railway waiting rooms if no other accommodation was available. They carried minimal supplies, including tea, sugar, biscuits, cheese, tinned meats, water, pillows, a blanket for each of them, writing materials, and medical and repair kits. They dispensed with their bicycles at the northern end of their trip and hiked over passes between [...] and [...] The trip was grueling. They often had little food or water, dealt with swarms of mosquitoes, fixed as many as 40 <b>bicycle</b> <b>tire</b> punctures per day, and slept in rat-infested quarters. Fanny Workman's book, written after the trip, highlighted the ancient architecture that they had seen rather than the contemporary local cultures. Mrs Workman mentions in [...] "My Asiatic Wanderings" [...] about India [...] "I have wheeled through much enchanting scenery, in the palm and banyan grooves of Orissa, Over the green and scarlet slopes of the Terai... But I have never cycled 1200 miles in a country so continuously beautiful." [...] The Workmans possessed an unusual amount of historical knowledge about India for Westerners of the time and had read the Jakata, Mahabharata, and Ramayana before their trip. They were eager to learn about the culture that had produced these epics and spent more time learning about ancient history than interacting with living people.|$|E
2500|$|The {{well-known}} {{dangers of}} the penny-farthing were, for {{the time of its}} prominence, outweighed by its strengths. [...] While it was a difficult, dangerous machine, it was simpler, lighter, and faster than the safer velocipedes of the time. [...] Two new developments changed this situation, and led to the rise of the safety bicycle. [...] The first was the chain drive, originally used on tricycles, allowing a gear ratio to be chosen independent of the wheel size. [...] The second was the pneumatic <b>bicycle</b> <b>tire,</b> allowing smaller wheels to provide a smooth ride.|$|E
2500|$|... with T1 and T2 {{in degrees}} Rankine or kelvins, p2 and p1 being {{absolute}} pressures and k = ratio of specific heats (approximately 1.4 for air). [...] The rise in air and temperature ratio means compression {{does not follow}} a simple pressure to volume ratio. This is less efficient, but quick. Adiabatic compression or expansion more closely model real life when a compressor has good insulation, a large gas volume, or a short time scale (i.e., a high power level). In practice {{there will always be}} a certain amount of heat flow out of the compressed gas. Thus, making a perfect adiabatic compressor would require perfect heat insulation of all parts of the machine. For example, even a <b>bicycle</b> <b>tire</b> pump's metal tube becomes hot as you compress the air to fill a tire.|$|E

50|$|Electrically-operated pumps {{intended}} to inflate car tires (as available in most service stations) can in principle {{be used to}} inflate a <b>bicycle</b> <b>tire</b> if the right type of connection is available.

Others may not cut off, but deliver {{a high rate of}} flow to fill the larger car tire, with a risk of overinflating and bursting a <b>bicycle</b> <b>tire</b> unless it is stopped with split-second timing.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bicycle</b> <b>tire</b> is a tire {{that fits}} {{on the wheel}} of a bicycle, unicycle, tricycle, quadracycle, bicycle trailer, or trailer bike. They may also be used on wheelchairs and handcycles, {{especially}} for racing. Bicycle tires provide an important source of suspension, generate the lateral forces necessary for balancing and turning, and generate the longitudinal forces necessary for propulsion and braking. They are the second largest source, after air drag, of power consumption on a level road. The modern detachable pneumatic <b>bicycle</b> <b>tire</b> contributed to the popularity and eventual dominance of the safety bicycle.|$|E

50|$|Studded {{tires are}} also used on bicycles, and the grip {{advantage}} on ice {{is similar to that}} from using traction sand, with the difference that there is no risk of blank spots when using studded tires. Quality tire manufacturers use studs with hard center pins also for <b>bicycle</b> <b>tires,</b> and just like their automobile counterparts, those studs will continue to protrude from the tire even after many years of usage on bare pavement. There are also low-quality studded <b>bicycle</b> <b>tires</b> being sold that have studs that lack the hard-metal center pin (there is still a center pin, but it is not made of hard metal). Such studs can wear out within a few weeks of cycling on dry pavement.|$|R
