5|$|Contact <b>brachytherapy</b> {{involves}} {{placement of}} the radiation source in a space next to the target tissue. This space may be a body cavity (intracavitary <b>brachytherapy)</b> such as the cervix, uterus or vagina; a body lumen (intraluminal <b>brachytherapy)</b> such as the trachea or oesophagus; or externally (surface <b>brachytherapy)</b> such as the skin. A radiation source can also be placed in blood vessels (intravascular <b>brachytherapy)</b> {{for the treatment of}} coronary in-stent restenosis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Brachytherapy</b> {{to treat}} {{prostate}} cancer {{can be given}} either as permanent LDR seed implantation or as temporary HDR <b>brachytherapy.</b>|$|E
5|$|If cancer growth blocks a short {{section of}} bronchus, <b>brachytherapy</b> (localized radiotherapy) {{may be given}} {{directly}} inside the airway to open the passage. Compared to external beam radiotherapy, <b>brachytherapy</b> allows a reduction in treatment time and reduced radiation exposure to healthcare staff. Evidence for <b>brachytherapy,</b> however, is less than that for external beam radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|The {{global market}} for <b>brachytherapy</b> reached US$680 million in 2013, {{of which the}} High-Dose Rate (HDR) and LDR {{segments}} accounted for 70%. Microspheres and electronic <b>brachytherapy</b> comprised the remaining 30%. One analysis predicts that the <b>brachytherapy</b> market may reach over US$2.4 billion in 2030, growing by 8% annually, mainly driven by the microspheres market as well as electronic <b>brachytherapy,</b> which is gaining significant interest worldwide as a user-friendly technology. The word brachy is Greek for short distance.|$|E
5|$|The {{likelihood}} {{and nature}} of potential acute, sub-acute or long-term side-effects associated with <b>brachytherapy</b> depends on {{the location of the}} tumour being treated and the type of <b>brachytherapy</b> being used.|$|E
5|$|The {{radioisotope}} iridium-192 {{is one of}} the {{two most}} important sources of energy for use in industrial γ-radiography for non-destructive testing of metals. Additionally, 192Ir is used as a source of gamma radiation for the treatment of cancer using <b>brachytherapy,</b> a form of radiotherapy where a sealed radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment. Specific treatments include high-dose-rate prostate <b>brachytherapy,</b> bilary duct <b>brachytherapy,</b> and intracavitary cervix <b>brachytherapy.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} methods {{that can be}} used to deliver breast brachytherapy: Interstitial breast <b>brachytherapy,</b> Intracavitary breast <b>brachytherapy,</b> Intraoperative {{radiation}} therapy, Permanent Breast Seed Implantation and non-invasive breast <b>brachytherapy</b> using mammography for target localization and an HDR source.|$|E
5|$|A {{course of}} <b>brachytherapy</b> can be {{completed}} {{in less time than}} other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer-cells to divide and grow in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. These features of <b>brachytherapy</b> mean that most patients are able to tolerate the <b>brachytherapy</b> procedure very well.|$|E
5|$|<b>Brachytherapy</b> can be {{used with}} the aim of curing the cancer in cases of small or locally {{advanced}} tumours, provided the cancer has not metastasized (spread {{to other parts of the}} body). In appropriately selected cases, <b>brachytherapy</b> for primary tumours often represents a comparable approach to surgery, achieving the same probability of cure and with similar side effects.|$|E
5|$|<b>Brachytherapy</b> for {{prostate}} cancer may cause erectile dysfunction in approximately 15-30% of patients. However, the risk of erectile dysfunction is related to age (older men are at a greater risk than younger men) and also the level of erectile function prior to receiving <b>brachytherapy.</b> In patients who do experience erectile dysfunction, {{the majority of cases}} can successfully be treated with drugs such as Viagra. Importantly, the risk of erectile dysfunction after <b>brachytherapy</b> is less than after radical prostatectomy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Brachytherapy</b> {{for skin}} cancer {{may result in}} a {{shedding}} of the outer layers of skin (desquamation) around the area of treatment in the weeks following therapy, which typically heals in 5–8 weeks. If the cancer is located on the lip, ulceration may occur as a result of <b>brachytherapy,</b> but usually resolves after 4–6 weeks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Brachytherapy</b> {{for skin}} cancer {{provides}} good cosmetic results and clinical efficacy; studies {{with up to}} 5 years follow-up have shown that <b>brachytherapy</b> is highly effective in terms local control, and is comparable to EBRT. Treatment times are typically short, providing convenience for patients.|$|E
5|$|<b>Brachytherapy</b> is {{commonly}} used to treat cancers of the cervix, prostate, breast, and skin.|$|E
5|$|Cervical cancer can {{be treated}} with either LDR, PDR or HDR <b>brachytherapy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Commonly used {{radiation}} sources (radionuclides) for <b>brachytherapy.</b>|$|E
5|$|High-dose rate (HDR) <b>brachytherapy</b> is {{when the}} rate of dose {{delivery}} exceeds 12Gy·h−1. The most common applications of HDR <b>brachytherapy</b> are in tumours of the cervix, esophagus, lungs, breasts and prostate. Most HDR treatments are performed on an outpatient basis, but this {{is dependent on the}} treatment site.|$|E
5|$|In a {{small number}} of people, <b>brachytherapy</b> may cause {{long-term}} side effects due to damage or disruption of adjacent tissues or organs. Long-term side effects are usually mild or moderate in nature. For example, urinary and digestive problems may persist as a result of <b>brachytherapy</b> for cervical or prostate cancer, and may require ongoing management.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} the tumour is not easily {{accessible}} or is too large to ensure an optimal distribution of irradiation to the treatment area, <b>brachytherapy</b> can be combined with other treatments, such as EBRT and/or surgery. Combination therapy of <b>brachytherapy</b> exclusively with chemotherapy is rare.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the acute}} side effects {{associated}} with <b>brachytherapy</b> {{can be treated}} with medication or through dietary changes, and usually disappear over time (typically a matter of weeks), once the treatment is completed. The acute side effects of HDR <b>brachytherapy</b> are broadly similar to EBRT.|$|E
5|$|Patients {{often ask}} {{if they need to}} have special safety {{precautions}} around family and friends after receiving <b>brachytherapy.</b> If temporary <b>brachytherapy</b> is used, no radioactive sources remain in the body after treatment. Therefore, there is no radiation risk to friends or family from being in close proximity with them.|$|E
5|$|Pulsed-dose rate (PDR) <b>brachytherapy</b> {{involves}} short {{pulses of}} radiation, typically once an hour, {{to simulate the}} overall rate and effectiveness of LDR treatment. Typical tumour sites treated by PDR <b>brachytherapy</b> are gynaecological and head and neck cancers.|$|E
5|$|Temporary <b>brachytherapy</b> {{involves}} {{placement of}} radiation sources {{for a set}} duration (usually a number of minutes or hours) before being withdrawn. The specific treatment duration will depend on many different factors, including the required rate of dose delivery and the type, size and location of the cancer. In LDR and PDR <b>brachytherapy,</b> the source typically stays in place up to 24 hours before being removed, while in HDR <b>brachytherapy</b> this time is typically a few minutes.|$|E
5|$|The use of HDR <b>brachytherapy</b> enables overall {{treatment}} {{times to}} be reduced compared with EBRT.|$|E
5|$|Used in {{combination}} with EBRT, <b>brachytherapy</b> can provide better outcomes than EBRT alone.|$|E
5|$|Acute {{side effects}} {{associated}} with <b>brachytherapy</b> include localised bruising, swelling, bleeding, discharge or discomfort within the implanted region. These usually resolve {{within a few}} days following completion of treatment.|$|E
5|$|<b>Brachytherapy</b> {{can be used}} in the {{treatment}} of coronary in-stent restenosis, in which a catheter is placed inside blood vessels, through which sources are inserted and removed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Brachytherapy</b> {{contrasts}} with unsealed source radiotherapy, {{in which a}} therapeutic radionuclide (radioisotope) is injected into the body to chemically localize to the tissue requiring destruction. It also contrasts to EBRT, in which high-energy x-rays (or occasionally gamma-rays from a radioisotope like cobalt-60) are directed at the tumour from outside the body. <b>Brachytherapy</b> instead involves the precise placement of short-range radiation-sources (radioisotopes) directly {{at the site of}} the cancerous tumour. These are enclosed in a protective capsule or wire, which allows the ionizing radiation to escape to treat and kill surrounding tissue but prevents the charge of radioisotope from moving or dissolving in body fluids. The capsule may be removed later, or (with some radioisotopes) it may be allowed to remain in place. A feature of <b>brachytherapy</b> is that the irradiation affects only a very localized area around the radiation sources. Exposure to radiation of healthy tissues farther away from the sources is therefore reduced. In addition, if the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body during treatment, the radiation sources retain their correct position in relation to the tumour. These characteristics of <b>brachytherapy</b> provide advantages over EBRT – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localised radiation whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues.|$|E
5|$|<b>Brachytherapy</b> {{for breast}} or skin cancer may cause scar tissue to form around the {{treatment}} area. In {{the case of}} breast <b>brachytherapy,</b> fat necrosis may occur {{as a result of}} fatty acids entering the breast tissues. This can cause the breast tissue to become swollen and tender. Fat necrosis is a benign condition and typically occurs 4–12 months after treatment and affects about 2% of patients.|$|E
5|$|<b>Brachytherapy</b> is {{commonly}} used {{in the treatment of}} early or locally confined cervical cancer and is a standard of care in many countries.|$|E
5|$|<b>Brachytherapy</b> {{treatment}} for cervical or prostate cancer can cause acute and transient urinary {{symptoms such as}} urinary retention, urinary incontinence or painful urination (dysuria).|$|E
5|$|HDR <b>brachytherapy</b> as a {{boost for}} {{prostate}} cancer also means that the EBRT course can be shorter than when EBRT is used alone.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} {{continued}} interest in vascular <b>brachytherapy</b> for persistent restenosis in failed stents and vein grafts.|$|E
5|$|In more {{advanced}} disease stages, <b>brachytherapy</b> {{can be used}} as palliative treatment for symptom relief from pain and bleeding.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of {{interstitial}} <b>brachytherapy,</b> the sources are placed directly in the target tissue of the affected site, such as the prostate or breast.|$|E
5|$|In {{treating}} In-stent restenosis (ISR) Drug Eluting stents (DES) {{have been}} found to be superior to Intracoronary <b>Brachytherapy</b> (ICBT).|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>brachytherapy</b> may become a standard of treatment for skin cancer in the near future.|$|E
