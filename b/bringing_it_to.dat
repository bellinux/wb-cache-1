5|$|In May and June 1953, {{an unusually}} {{long-lasting}} upper-level low persisted across Mexico and Central America. On May 25, a weak warm-core surface circulation developed east of Nicaragua. It {{moved around the}} upper-level low, <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the northwest and later looping to the south through Honduras and Central America. The system weakened over land, but it re-intensified over the western Caribbean Sea, moving over western Cuba as a 50mph (80km/h) tropical storm on May 31. Advisories for Alice did not begin until June 1, when the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

5|$|As {{introduced}} in Soulcalibur, Ivy {{was raised by}} the Valentines, a noble family in London, England. Ivy's father became obsessed with the cursed sword Soul Edge, and worked himself to death. Her mother died shortly afterward, and revealed to Ivy {{that she was not}} their biological daughter. Becoming an alchemist, Ivy learned of her father's obsession and decided to destroy Soul Edge. She created an animated, segmented sword, <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> life by unknowingly summoning Soul Edge's current host, Nightmare, and was convinced to become one of his servants without realizing he wielded the blade she sought. After learning the truth, and that her real father was the sword's previous host Cervantes and her to be its next, she departed. Continuing her quest to destroy the sword in later games, Ivy was attacked by Cervantes and her soul consumed in Soulcalibur IV. Using an artificial soul to keep herself alive, she acts as a teacher to younger warriors when the sword re-appears years later.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, however, Sinclair Radionics was {{experiencing}} serious difficulties. It lost {{its ability to}} compete effectively in the calculator market following the launch {{of a new generation}} of Japanese-produced calculators with liquid crystal displays, which were much more capable and power-efficient than Sinclair's LED calculators. Projects to develop a pocket television and digital watch turned out to be expensive failures. The company made losses of more than £350,000 in 1975–76, <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the edge of bankruptcy. In July 1977 Radionics was rescued by a state agency, the National Enterprise Board (NEB), which recapitalised it, provided a loan facility and took effective control of the company by acquiring a 73% stake.|$|E
5|$|In 1785, Rotheram married Dorothy Harle of Newcastle, {{with whom}} he had three daughters. He {{returned}} to naval service in 1787 aboard HMS Bombay Castle and {{over the next four years}} moved between HMS Culloden and HMS Vengeance, all in the Channel Fleet. In 1792 Rotheram was made first lieutenant of HMS Culloden and was still in this position when the French Revolutionary War broke out a year later. Culloden was part of the Channel Fleet under Rotheram's old commander Lord Howe, and the ship was captained by Isaac Schomberg during the Atlantic campaign of May 1794, in which Howe pursued a French fleet deep into the Atlantic, <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> battle at the Glorious First of June.|$|E

5|$|Lead Balloon is a British {{television}} series produced by Open Mike Productions for BBC Four. The series was created and is co-written by comedian Jack Dee and Pete Sinclair. It stars Dee as Rick Spleen, a cynical and misanthropic comedian whose life is plagued by petty annoyances, disappointments and embarrassments. Raquel Cassidy, Sean Power and Tony Gardner also star. The first series of six episodes was broadcast on BBC Four in 2006, {{with the first}} episode achieving the highest ratings for a comedy on the channel. Repeats of the series were run on BBC Two and BBC HD, <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a larger audience. The second series of eight episodes aired on BBC Two from November 2007; the third series aired from November 2008; and the final series aired from 31 May 2011 until 5 July.|$|E
5|$|State Highway 34 {{was first}} {{designated}} on June 15, 1931. At that time, the highway {{began at the}} free bridge over the Red River north of Quanah, Texas, and followed what is today SH-6 {{to the point that}} is now SH-34's southern terminus. There, it turned north, following its current alignment. Its 1931 alignment did not differ significantly from that of the present day (although it followed US-66 through Elk City prior to the establishment of I-40) until it got to Woodward. Rather than continue north out of town, the SH-34 of that day instead turned west, then north, passing through Fort Supply and crossing into Harper County just north of that town. It then began a concurrency with US-60 in Buffalo, turning east and connecting with its final segment, <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Kansas state line. Thus, SH-34 started life as a border-to-border highway.|$|E
5|$|Sue Bailey Thurman (née, Sue Elvie Bailey; August 26, 1903 – December 25, 1996) was an American author, lecturer, {{historian}} {{and civil rights}} activist. She was the first non-white student to earn a bachelor's degree in music from Oberlin College, Ohio. She briefly taught at the Hampton Institute in Virginia, before becoming involved in international work with the YWCA in 1930. During a six-month trip through Asia in the mid 1930s, Thurman became the first African-American woman to have an audience with Mahatma Gandhi. The meeting with Gandhi inspired Thurman and her husband, theologian Howard Thurman, to promote non-violent resistance {{as a means of}} creating social change, <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the attention of a young preacher, Martin Luther King Jr. While they did not actively protest during the Civil Rights Movement, they served as spiritual counselors to many on the front lines, and helped establish the first interracial, non-denominational church in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} {{were determined}} that the show be respectful of audience expectations for the Horrible Histories brand, maintaining its familiar visual style and content as far as possible. Early concepts for <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the screen involved framing or interpretive devices, including a ghostly train carrying children into the past, or a wizard storyteller to act as their guide. Eventually Bradley with producer/director Dominic Brigstocke concluded that the material {{was strong enough to}} stand on its own, so they developed, in consultation with CBBC executives, a live-action sketch-comedy showcase. Once the writing was underway, the producers further discovered that sticking as closely as possible to the historical truth made it easier for them to find the humour within it. They then introduced a comedy style relying on parodies of familiar modern media conventions as a means of making these historical details more immediately accessible.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} {{different}} circumstances from which they came, and in which they played, the rhythm and blues produced by British artists was very different in tone from that created by African Americans, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. They have been criticised for exploiting the massive catalogue of African American music, {{but it has also}} been noted that they both popularised that music, <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> British, world and in some cases American audiences, and helping to build the reputation of existing and past rhythm and blues artists. In order to sustain their careers most British R artists soon moved on from recording and performing American standards to writing and recording their own music. Many from the 60s helped pioneer psychedelic, and eventually progressive, hard rock and heavy metal, mixing in elements of world, folk and classical music. Others from the 1970s and 1980s, helped shape new wave and post-punk music and had a major impact on later genres, including Britpop. As a result, British rhythm and blues has been a major component of the sound of rock music.|$|E
5|$|In general, the USACE {{credited}} existing {{flood control}} projects as preventing additional flooding. In West Virginia alone, {{it was estimated}} that existing flood-control projects saved about $135million in damage. Lake Moomaw in western Virginia helped prevent $70million in damage along the James River. In Pennsylvania, flood measures resulted in minimal flooding along the Youghiogheny River. After sustaining damage from flooding along the Monongahela River with little warning, the owners of a marina filed a class action lawsuit in the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County on November21, 1985, against West Penn Power Company to compensate for damages. The plaintiffs believed that the damage occurred because the company opened the flood gates of the Lake Lynn Dam. The power company attempted to move the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in March 1986, citing the Federal Power Act's provision that claims should be in the District Court, but the nature of the suit sent it back to the Court of Common Pleas, <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> trial in September 1989. The jury found that although the West Penn Power was negligent, the damage was caused mainly by the historic and unprecedented flooding; consequently, the case entered a compulsory nonsuit, meaning the company was not required to pay compensation. The plaintiffs sought an appeal in 1990, which was denied.|$|E

The album's five tracks have a duration of 1:12:30, with the encore track <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> 1:20:56. Upon release, it reach position #13 on the German classical Media Control Charts for sales in September 2010. The Japanese release reached position #102 on the Oricon charts and stayed on the charts for one week. After the concert in Tokyo, a second album was released. Titled Symphonic Fantasies Tokyo, the two-disc album is a recording of that performance, including the encore. The album, produced by Merregnon Studios and mixed {{by a team of}} sound engineers from Japan and Germany, was released on June 11, 2012. Its cover is {{a modified version of the}} original European album with a large red circle, and it includes a twenty-page booklet with comments from the original composers. The album's six tracks have a length of 1:20:50.
