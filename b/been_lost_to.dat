5|$|About 100 {{separate}} {{stations for}} box huckleberry {{have been documented}} in the scientific literature. By the time of Baird's collection in 1845, the West Virginia stations of the plant had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> science, and his Pennsylvania colony {{was the only one}} known for some time. Specimens of box huckleberry were subsequently identified in Delaware in 1870, by William M. Canby.|$|E
5|$|Béla {{supported}} {{the development of}} towns. For instance, he confirmed the liberties {{of the citizens of}} Székesfehérvár and granted privileges to Hungarian and German settlers in Bars (Starý Tekov, Slovakia) in 1237. Zadar, a town in Dalmatia which had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> Venice in 1202, acknowledged Béla's suzerainty in 1240.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 58 B-57 Canberras were {{recorded}} as having <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> during the Vietnam War; of these, 26 <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> ground fire, 5 <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> mortar fire and ground attack, 4 <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> mid-air collision, 10 <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> airfield accidental bomb explosion, 7 <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> operational causes, and 6 <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> due <b>to</b> unknown causes.

5|$|Owner/occupant John Rolph Malloch died in 1951 {{at the age}} of 39. In {{the early}} 1980s the {{building}} was converted from rental apartments to condominiums. The original plans had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> fire, so the renovating architects had to form new plans taken from measurements of the building.|$|E
5|$|Since the Neolithic Revolution about 47% of the world's forests have <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> human use. Present-day forests occupy about {{a quarter}} of the world's {{ice-free}} land with about half of these occurring in the tropics. In temperate and boreal regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but deforestation in the tropics is of major concern.|$|E
5|$|While {{much of the}} Loop's 19th-century {{architecture}} has <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> demolition and redevelopment, the Rookery {{has been}} spared this fate {{through a series of}} well executed renovations.

5|$|Bohemond {{decided to}} recover Anazarbus and other territories which had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> the Cilician Armenia. He invaded Cilicia in February 1130, {{traveling}} along the Ceyhan River. Leo I of Cilicia sought {{assistance from the}} Danishmend Emir Gazi Gümüshtigin who made a surprise attack on Bohemond's army. Bohemond and his soldiers were massacred in the battle. According to Michael the Syrian, the Turks killed Bohemond {{because they did not}} recognize him; had they recognized him, they would have saved him so they could demand a ransom from him. Gümüshtigin had Bohemond's head embalmed and sent to Al-Mustarshid, the Abbasid Caliph.|$|E
5|$|It is in {{this period}} that the broch was built. Part of the {{structure}} has <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> coastal erosion, and modern sea defences have been erected. The tower was probably originally 13metres (40feet) or more high and as with many broch sites the position would have commanded fine views of the surrounding seas. During this period archaeological sites in Shetland usually exhibit defensive fortifications of some kind, and Jarlshof is no exception. An outer defensive wall associated with the broch contained a substantial (although rather poorly constructed) house and byre at one time. This wall was utilised at a later stage to build a large roundhouse {{in the lee of}} the broch.|$|E
5|$|Regular {{stocking}} {{since the}} start of the 1980s have re-established reasonable populations of golden perch and Murray cod; native fish that were indigenous to the Molonglo River before the lake was built, but had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> mining pollution of the Molonglo River in the first half of the 20th century. The main reason for stocking is to boost fish stocks along the Molonglo, which have been depleted by overfishing, introduced species and habitat destruction. One of the motives for raising the level of Murray cod and golden perch is to balance the ecosystem by having them act as native predators of other fish.|$|E

5|$|Sultan Mehmed II died on 3 May 1481. A {{civil war}} ensued in the Ottoman Empire between his sons Bayezid II and Cem. Defeated, Cem fled to Rhodes, where the Knights Hospitaller {{kept him in}} custody. Matthias claimed Cem's custody {{in the hope of}} using him to gain {{concessions}} from Bayezid, but Venice and Pope Innocent VIII strongly opposed this plan. In late 1481, Hungarian auxiliary troops supported Matthias's father-in-law Ferdinand I of Naples to reoccupy Otranto, which had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> the Ottomans the year before.|$|E
5|$|The {{territorial}} {{extent of}} Scotland is generally that {{established by the}} 1237 Treaty of York between Scotland and the Kingdom of England and the 1266 Treaty of Perth between Scotland and Norway. Important exceptions include the Isle of Man, which having <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> England in the 14th century is now a crown dependency outside of the United Kingdom; the island groups Orkney and Shetland, which were acquired from Norway in 1472; and Berwick-upon-Tweed, lost to England in 1482.|$|E
5|$|This brought Kenney into {{conflict}} with the Chief of the Air Staff of the RAAF, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, who felt that an opportunity had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> simplify {{the administration of the}} RAAF. Kenney preferred to have Bostock in command, and while he regarded the antipathy between Jones and Bostock as a nuisance, was happy to leave arrangements the way they were. However, Kenney deviated from the normal structure of an air force by creating the Advanced Echelon (ADVON) under Whitehead. The new headquarters had the authority to change the assignments of aircraft in the forward area, where fast-changing weather and enemy action could overtake orders drawn up in Australia. Kenney was promoted to lieutenant general on 21 October 1942.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{his early}} career, {{although}} determined {{to become a}} musician, Beer {{found it difficult to}} decide between playing and composition. Certainly other professionals in the decade 1810–1820, including Moscheles, considered him amongst the greatest virtuosi of his period. He wrote during this period numerous piano pieces, including a concerto and set of variations for piano and orchestra, but these have <b>been</b> <b>lost.</b> <b>To</b> this period also belongs a Clarinet Quintet written for the virtuoso Heinrich Baermann (1784–1847) who remained a close friend of the composer.|$|E
5|$|Walter held a legateship from Pope Celestine III from 1195 to 1198, {{which enabled}} him to act with the pope's {{delegated}} authority within the English Church. Walter actively investigated ecclesiastical misconduct, and deposed several abbots, including Robert of Thorney Abbey in 1195 and an abbot of St Mary's {{in the province of}} the Archbishop of York. At the monastic cathedral of Worcester, he disciplined the monks between the death of Henry de Sully and the election of John of Coutances, as was his right as the archbishop of the province. In his own diocese, he granted markets and fairs to towns, was granted the privilege of minting coins at Shrewsbury, and worked to recover lands and manors that had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> the archdiocese.|$|E
5|$|Æthelwig (c. 1013–16 February {{in either}} 1077 or 1078) was an Abbot of Evesham {{before and during}} the Norman Conquest of England. Born {{sometime}} around 1010 or 1015, he was elected abbot in 1058. Known for his legal expertise, he administered estates for Ealdred, the Bishop of Worcester prior to his election as abbot. After his election, he appears to have acted as Ealdred's deputy, and was considered as a possible successor when Ealdred was elected Archbishop of York. Æthelwig worked during his abbacy to recover estates that had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> Evesham, as well as acquiring more estates.|$|E

5|$|Between December 1941 and March 1942, over 300 P-40 Kittyhawks, 100 P-400 and 90 P-39 Airacobras {{had been}} sent to Australia; of these, around 125 had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> enemy action in the Dutch East Indies campaign, 75 had been {{transferred}} to the RAAF, 74 were under or awaiting repair and perhaps another 100 had yet to be completely assembled. On 18 March, 33 P-39s, 92 P-40s and 52 P-400s were on hand. While there were three USAAF pursuit groups in Australia, the 8th, 35th and 49th, Wurtsmith's was the only one considered combat ready. Of the 102 pilots in his group, only Wurtsmith, with 4,800 hours of pursuit time, and his executive officer, Major Donald R. Hutchinson, with 2,600 hours, were veteran pilots. Five others had more than 600 hours and nine had about 15 hours. The remaining 89 pilots had no pursuit time at all.|$|E
5|$|Cley {{and nearby}} Blakeney had been prosperous and {{important}} ports in the Middle Ages, but land reclamation schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 {{just to the}} west of Cley, led to the silting up of the shipping channel and relocation of the wharf. Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley. In an attempt to halt the decline, Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> Blakeney and other Norfolk ports. The population stagnated, and the value of all property decreased sharply. In the mid-nineteenth century, the Lord of the Manor constructed the present road to the beach in exchange for closing the ancient right of way across the marshes.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} {{to erect a}} further seven high-quality stelae until AD736, monuments that are considered masterpieces of Classic Maya sculpture with such mastery of detail that they represent the highest pinnacle of Maya artistic achievement. The stelae depict king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil ritually posed and bearing the attributes {{of a variety of}} deities, including B'olon K'awiil, K'uy Nik Ajaw and Mo' Witz Ajaw. The king also carried out major construction works, including a new version of Temple26 that now bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, plus two temples that have now <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> the erosion of the Copán River. He also encased the Rosalila phase of Temple16 within a new phase of construction. He remodelled the ballcourt, then demolished it and built a new one in its place.|$|E
