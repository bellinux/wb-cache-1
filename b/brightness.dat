5|$|During {{and after}} World War II, the Yehudi lights project {{developed}} counter-illumination camouflage using lamps {{to increase the}} <b>brightness</b> of the aircraft to match the <b>brightness</b> of the sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, which seemed to render visible light camouflage redundant. However, aircraft continue to be painted in camouflage schemes; recent experiments have again explored active camouflage systems which allow colors, patterns and <b>brightness</b> to be changed to match the background, and some air forces have painted their fighters in digital camouflage patterns. Stealth technology, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section and infrared signature, effectively providing multi-spectral camouflage {{at the price of}} reduced flying performance. Stealth may extend to avoiding or preventing vapor contrails.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-11 and its planets were {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in <b>brightness</b> in stars.

5|$|The <b>brightness</b> of a star, as {{seen from}} Earth, is {{measured}} with a standardized, logarithmic scale. This apparent magnitude is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing <b>brightness</b> of the star. The faintest stars visible to the unaided eye are sixth magnitude, while the brightest, Sirius, is of magnitude −1.46. To standardize the magnitude scale, astronomers chose Vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths. Thus, for many years, Vega {{was used as a}} baseline for the calibration of absolute photometric <b>brightness</b> scales. However, this is no longer the case, as the apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified flux. This approach is more convenient for astronomers, since Vega is not always available for calibration.|$|E
5|$|The {{individual}} apparent magnitudes {{of the two}} component stars {{cannot be}} directly measured, but their relative <b>brightness</b> has been measured at various wavelengths.

A 2016 measurement gives the magnitude difference between the two stars at a wavelength of 700 nm as 0.00 ± 0.1.|$|E
40|$|We apply {{computational}} seismic holography to high-frequency helioseismic {{observations of}} the quiet Sun from SDO/HMI to locate predominant sources of seismic emission {{with respect to the}} structure of the solar granulation. The regions of greatest seismic emission are the edges of photospheric granules. Seismic emission from regions whose continuum <b>brightnesses</b> are 95 - 100 % of the mean, as resolved by HMI, are about 2. 5 times as emissive as regions whose <b>brightnesses</b> are 100 - 104 % of the mean. The greater seismic emissivity from regions whose <b>brightnesses</b> are somewhat less than the mean is roughly in line with expectations from an understanding that attributes most seismic emission to cool plumes plummeting from the edges of granules. However, seismic emission from regions whose continuum <b>brightnesses</b> significantly exceed 104 % of the mean is also remarkably high. This unexpected feature of high-frequency seismic emission from the solar granulation begs to be understood.

5|$|As {{a result}} of such dynamics, Pleione {{exhibits}} prominent long-term photometric and spectroscopic variations encompassing a period of about 35 years. In fact, during the last 100 years, Pleione has demonstrated notable phase changesas a Be phase until 1903, a B phase (1905–1936), a B-shell phase (1938–1954), and another Be phase (1955–1972). It then entered a Be-shell phase in 1972. Then, the star developed many shell absorption lines in its spectrum. At the same time, the star showed a decrease in <b>brightness,</b> beginning at the end of 1971. After reaching the minimum <b>brightness</b> in late 1973, the star gradually brightened. In 1989, Pleione entered a Be phase and stayed as a Be star until the summer of 2005.|$|E
5|$|At Princeton University, Henry Norris Russell was {{following}} a similar course of research.

When he plotted the spectral types of these stars against their absolute magnitude, he found that dwarf stars followed a distinct relationship. This allowed the real <b>brightness</b> of a dwarf star to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.|$|E
5|$|Counter-illumination through {{bioluminescence}} on {{the underside}} (ventral region) {{of the body is}} found in many species that live in the open ocean down to about 1000 metres. The generated light increases an animal's <b>brightness</b> when seen from below to match the <b>brightness</b> of the ocean surface; it is an effective form of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of squid, such as the midwater squid, Abralia veranyi. These have light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over their undersides, creating a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below. Counter-illumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling.|$|E

40|$|We present near {{infrared}} {{observations of the}} red gravitational lens system MG 0414 + 0534. Our images are of sufficient quality to allow photometry of all four QSO images and the lens galaxy. The observations show that the K-band <b>brightnesses</b> of the components are more similar to the radio <b>brightnesses</b> than to the optical and thus {{support the notion that}} the system is highly reddened. The differing <b>brightnesses</b> at visible wavelengths are interpreted as variable amounts of extinction in the lens galaxy. The lens galaxy is detected at K-band and is as red as any other known galaxy of comparable apparent magnitude. An estimate of the redshift of the lens galaxy of 0 : 45 ! z ! 0 : 6 is determined from the Faber-Jackson relation and photometric considerations. By extension we argue that other very red field galaxies may contain large amounts of dust. K-band spectra of the individual components show no difference in the Hff equivalent widths among the components.

40|$|In {{this article}} we use 1420 MHz data to {{demonstrate}} the likely reality of Galactic radio Loops V and VI. We further estimate distances and spectral indices for both these and the four main radio loops. In the cases of Loops I - IV, radio spectral indices are calculated from the mean <b>brightnesses</b> at 1420 and 820 / 404 MHz. The spectral indices of Loops V and VI are obtained from T - T plots between 1420 and 408 MHz. Using the supernova remnant (SNR) hypothesis for the origin of radio loops, distances are calculated from the surface <b>brightnesses</b> and the angular diameters at 1420 MHz. We also study how results for <b>brightnesses</b> and distances of radio loops agree with current theories of SNR evolution. For this purpose, the ambient density and initial explosion energy of the loops are discussed. We also discuss applications of different Σ - D relations. The results obtained confirm a non-thermal origin and nearby locations for the Galactic radio loops. Therefore, we have indications {{that they are very}} old SNRs that evolve in low ambient densities, with high initial explosion energies. Comment: 6 pages, 4 tables, 4 figures.

The Courage arc jumped forward by 8° to 294° (it probably jumped over to the next stable co-rotation resonance position) while the Liberté arc had almost disappeared by 2003. The Fraternité and Égalité (1 and 2) arcs have demonstrated irregular variations in their relative <b>brightness.</b> Their observed dynamics is probably related to the exchange of dust between them.
