25|$|When Queen Sibylla {{and their}} daughters died of disease later that year, King Guy {{no longer had}} a legal claim to the throne — but refused to step aside. The heiress of Jerusalem was Queen Sibylla's {{half-sister}} Isabella, who was married to Humphrey IV of Toron, of whom she was fond. However, Conrad had the support of her mother Maria Comnena and stepfather Balian of Ibelin, as well as Reginald of Sidon and other major nobles of Outremer. They obtained an annulment on the grounds that Isabella had been under-age {{at the time of the}} marriage and had not <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> consent. Conrad then married Isabella himself, despite rumours of bigamy because of his marriage to Theodora, who was still alive. However, Choniates, who usually expresses strong disapproval of marital/sexual irregularities, makes no mention of this. This may imply that a divorce had been effected from the Byzantine side before 1190, by which time it was obvious that Conrad would not be returning. There were also objections on grounds of canonical incest, since Conrad's brother had previously been married to Isabella's half-sister, and Church law regarded this kind of affinity as equal to a blood-relationship. However, the papal legate Ubaldo Lanfranchi, Archbishop of Pisa, gave his approval. Opponents claimed he had been bribed. The marriage, on 24 November 1190, was conducted by Philip of Dreux, Bishop of Beauvais — son of Conrad's cousin Robert I of Dreux. Conrad was now de jure King of Jerusalem. However, he had been wounded in battle only nine days previously, and returned with his bride to Tyre to recover. He came back to the siege in spring, making an unsuccessful sea-attack against the Tower of Flies at the harbour entrance.|$|E

Several days after returning to France, Diarra made his debut, coming on as a substitute and providing assist for debutant Axel Ngando, who scored his first goal for the club to settle a draw with Lorient. Diarra made twelve appearances before returning to West Ham United after manager Frédéric Antonetti publicity criticised him, claiming [...] "he has not <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> all that he could give".|$|E

The article remarked that the Bureau [...] "seemed almost as uninformed as the ordinary citizen" [...] in regards to the forecasting. The chief of the Weather Bureau, Stephen Lichtblau, fired back, saying that [...] "we were fortunate to get a warning." [...] He continued [...] "had [...] not had... equipment they are complaining about, we could have [...] nothing," [...] and maintained that warnings were issued promptly. When repairs in Calhoun County, Texas were completed in 1961, Hurricane Carla struck shortly thereafter in September.|$|E

His secretary Traudl Junge stated that during the war, Hitler telephoned Braun every day. He was concerned for her safety when she was staying in the Munich home he had bought her. Junge further asked Hitler once why he never married. Hitler replied, [...] "...I wouldn't have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> enough time to my wife". Hitler told her that he didn't want children, as they would have had [...] "...a very hard time, because they're expected to possess the same gifts as their famous parents and they can't be forgiven for being mediocre". In the end, Hitler and Braun married in the Berlin Führerbunker in late April 1945, less than 40 hours before committing suicide together.|$|E

500|$|While in Friedberg, Presley met 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu. They would {{eventually}} marry after a seven-and-a-half-year courtship. In her autobiography, Priscilla says that despite his worries {{that it would}} ruin his career, Parker convinced Presley that to gain popular respect, he should serve his country as a regular soldier rather than in Special Services, where he would have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> some musical performances and remain {{in touch with the}} public. Media reports echoed Presley's concerns about his career, but RCA producer Steve Sholes and Freddy Bienstock of Hill and Range had carefully prepared for his two-year hiatus. Armed with a substantial amount of unreleased material, they kept up a regular stream of successful releases. Between his induction and discharge, Presley had ten top 40 hits, including [...] "Wear My Ring Around Your Neck", the best-selling [...] "Hard Headed Woman", and [...] "One Night" [...] in 1958, and [...] "(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such as I" [...] and the number one [...] "A Big Hunk o' Love" [...] in 1959. RCA also generated four albums compiling old material during this period, most successfully Elvis' Golden Records (1958), which hit number three on the LP chart.|$|E
500|$|Saban {{engineered}} {{a number}} of trades before the 1967 season. He brought Gilchrist to the team from Miami in a seven-player deal; Denver had sent Gilchrist to Miami the previous season. He also acquired quarterback Steve Tensi from the Chargers in August for first-round draft picks in 1968 and 1969. Denver won its first game, but proceeded to lose nine {{in a row and}} finish with a 3–11 record. The team improved only marginally in the ensuing years, posting losing records in 1968 and 1969. The AFL and National Football League merged beginning in 1970, but the Broncos continued to lose, posting a record of 5–8–1 in 1970. Saban resigned after the Broncos got off to a 2–6–1 start in 1971. He said resigning was [...] "my responsibility to the team" [...] and what while the club made progress, [...] "my only regret is that we have not <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Denver a championship". Saban's record as Denver's coach was 20–42–3. Although he was not successful in Denver, Saban became well known for his intensity and occasional temper tantrums. A much-watched clip of him bemoaning to Denver line coach Whitey Dovell that [...] "They're killin' me out there, Whitey, they're killin' me!" [...] introduced Saban to a wider audience when it was aired by NFL Films.|$|E
500|$|Pinto {{had four}} {{releases}} in 2011. The {{first was the}} science fiction film Rise of the Planet of the Apes, a reboot of the Planet of the Apes series. She {{played the role of}} Caroline Aranha, a primatologist who falls in love with the main character, played by James Franco. To prepare for her role, she researched the career of English anthropologist Jane Goodall. The film went on to gross [...] million worldwide; it remains her highest-grossing film as of April 2016. Pinto's character received criticism for being too one-dimensional: Anthony Quinn of The Independent called it a [...] "failure", and Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter described the character as the most [...] "boringly decorous tag-along girlfriend seen onscreen in years." [...] Pinto's second screen appearance of the year was playing the title character in Michael Winterbottom's Trishna. The film, based on Thomas Hardy's novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles, gave Pinto the role of a teenage Rajasthani peasant, who leaves her family to work for a British-born Indian hotelier, played by Riz Ahmed. It premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and gained a mixed response from critics. Nishat Bari of India Today called Pinto's role her [...] "most substantial" [...] one to that point. Philip French of The Guardian stated that Pinto [...] "captivates" [...] in the lead role, while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called her performance [...] "touchingly beautiful". In contrast, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that Pinto is [...] "one of [...] loveliest attractions, but she and her director haven't <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Trishna a pulse".|$|E

[...] "I went straight from the cigarettes into an eating disorder", she told People magazine in 1992. [...] "I started throwing up.

My feelings about myself, even though I had <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up smoking and lose 20 lbs., were of increasing despair." [...] She has written at length of her years of addiction to alcohol, the damage it did to her personal and musical life and how it contributed to her feelings of depression. Collins admits that although she tried other drugs in the 1960s, alcohol had always been her drug of first choice, just as it had been for her father. She entered a rehabilitation program in Pennsylvania in 1978 and has maintained her sobriety ever since, even through such traumatic events as the death of her only child, Clark, who committed suicide in 1992 at age 33 after a long bout with clinical depression and substance abuse. Since his death, she has also become an activist for suicide prevention.|$|E
