25|$|For {{political}} reasons, Pakistan claims {{victory in}} the 1965 war. In my opinion, the war ended {{in a kind of}} stalemate. We were in a position of strength. Had the war continued for a few more days, we would have gained a decisive victory. I advised then prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri not to agree for ceasefire. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was under pressure from the United Nations and some countries.|$|E
500|$|Mold {{was popular}} with other cricketers. The Times said: [...] "Apart {{from the burning}} {{question}} of throwing, not a word could be said against him. He was liked by all his brother professionals, and popular wherever he played." [...] However, his achievements were always qualified by suspicion over the legality of his bowling action, even before he was no-balled by Phillips. A batsman who played against him when he first appeared for Northamptonshire said: [...] "If he is fair {{he is the best}} bowler in England, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is a worse thrower than ever Crossland [...] was." [...] Mold's Times obituary stated: [...] "He was a deadly fast bowler, but, all through his career, even his best feats in the cricket field were spoken of with something of apology".|$|E
500|$|Abra {{returned}} {{yet again}} to Holby in episode [...] "The Human Jungle". [...] Initially, Kyla was furious with him, and resisted {{his attempts to}} win her backblaming him {{for the death of}} her ex-husband, which occurred in his absence and resulted in her son being taken into foster care. [...] However, Abra persisted, and was able to convince her to resume their relationship, and move in with him. Ayola said of the relationship at the time: [...] "It's love! Well, she loves him <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> loves moving around the world more. He's a drifter. I wouldn't put any money on a happy ending for them. He's such a rolling stone and she's so emotionally wrong that I don't think it's going to work. On the plus side, I think this pair probably have a fantastic sex life and a great time down the pub." ...|$|E

500|$|Sections of {{the media}} have often campaigned for a {{particular}} person to be appointed England manager. At various times, but particularly during the tenure of Bobby Robson, the media campaigned for the appointment of Brian Clough. Robson once told FA chairman Bert Millichip [...] "I'm having a rough time and everybody wants Brian– give the job to him. If he's successful, everybody's happy. If he fails, that's {{the end of the}} clamour for Brian Clough to be England manager." [...] Robson added, [...] "He would have ruffled a few feathers and disturbed the corridors of power <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would have been a good England manager. He had good judgement, knew how to design a team and was a great motivator." [...] Terry Venables was also the subject of a media campaign for dismissal during his time as manager but was then supported by the press to return to the role in 2000.|$|E
500|$|When the emissaries {{returned}} to Buenos Aires, {{the government was}} worried by the defeats of Rondeau at Sipe Sipe and the political stir generated by José Gervasio Artigas and Estanislao López. Alvarez Thomas appointed Belgrano to head the army at Rosario, but shortly afterwards Thomas resigned. Pueyrredón became the new Supreme Director. With {{the signing of the}} Santo Tomé pact, the aforementioned army was retired from Rosario. Belgrano was then sent back to take command of the Army of the North, with the strong support of San Martín. [...] "In the case of designating who must replace Rondeau, I am decided for Belgrano; he is the most methodical man of all whom I know in America; he is full of integrity and natural talent. He may not have the military knowledge of a Moreau or a Bonaparte as far as the army is concerned, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is the best we have in South America".|$|E
500|$|Presley {{undertook}} three brief tours {{during the}} year, continuing {{to generate a}} crazed audience response. A Detroit newspaper suggested that [...] "the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed." [...] Villanova students pelted him with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver, the crowd rioted {{after the end of}} the show, destroying the stage. Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenaged girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as [...] "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious.... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons.... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore." [...] Asked for a response, Presley said, [...] "I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> shouldn't have said it.... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago." ...|$|E

500|$|The writers first {{detailed}} Cane as [...] "a smart, loyal, {{and moral}} survivalist with an edge". Goddard describes Cane as a [...] "typical Australian, working-class {{kind of guy}} who mined opals, raised goats, then went off for travel and adventure to sort of find himself". Global BC penned Cane as [...] "mysterious". SoapNet described Cane as a [...] "pretty stand-up guy", as well as [...] "loyal and dedicated to the people he cares about". The network said his time in Genoa City has [...] "made him a good man". In an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, Goddard said that Cane working at Jabot Cosmetics is [...] "very enthusiastic and cautious about falling into a family business which is an Abbott company", and that he is [...] "very sensitive about that". He also stated that Cane [...] "has no fears in doing business with anybody" [...] because if you can come from a [...] "family of gangsters than business people don’t really measure up". Looking back on Cane's [...] "power jobs", Goddard stated: [...] "I don’t think Cane has the book learning skills side of it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has the life lessons side of it, based on who he is and where he has come from. The way he does business with people, he kind of understands who they are as people." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1999, Nicolas Anelka stated {{his desire}} to leave Arsenal and cited the English media {{as a reason for}} wanting to leave the club as they caused him [...] "enormous {{problems}} on a personal level". Lazio was interested in signing the player, but the Italian club refused to pay Arsenal's asking price of £23million. After Real Madrid reopened negotiations with Arsenal and Anelka, a deal was finally reached on 1 August 1999 and the player signed for the club, the next day. Arsenal sought to strengthen the squad's attacking options first by signing Davor Šuker from Real Madrid; the player was prepared to take a pay cut to join the club. The club then signed Juventus forward Thierry Henry for a club record fee of £11million. Wenger, who served as the player's protégé at Monaco, believed his best position was as a goalscorer: [...] "He was the top scorer in the Under-17s for France when I first had him and I think that, as well as having the qualities of youth, pace and power, he is a good finisher. That is something he has not worked on enough {{in the last two years}} because he has played more wide, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> can become a central striker again. That is what we will try to develop together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Matthews {{was kept}} on as Australia's spinner for the First Test against the West Indies at the Gabba in 1992–93. [...] "His {{performance}} {{over the past}} 12 months has been sensational", said Border. [...] "He cops a lot of flak because his strike rate is {{not as high as}} some bowlers' but he's a 100 per cent man. It does come down to him taking wickets <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> can do a job for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps he didn't {{understand}} your joking, father. He's a foreigner, and shy and proud, and--not like the others. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{knew what you}} meant then, {{any more than he}} believed he was making a bargain before. He may be poor, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> been--a--a--gentleman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is an uncommonly good-looking young fellow; {{straight}} made, broad in the chest, with a good, honest eye, {{and a young}} man's proper courage.

6000|$|... "Oh, it worries him, of course, poor dear," [...] Mrs. Phillips answered. [...] "You see, I've {{always been}} such a go-ahead, as a rule. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> getting more hopeful. As I tell him, I'll be all right by the autumn. It was that spell of hot weather that knocked me over." ...|$|R
2500|$|He {{said that}} he would safely and conscientiously trust him with a {{considerable}} trust in government, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> said it with a little hesitation. It is clear that he is not quite at ease about him, tho' as far as I can see determined not to abandon him. ... The combat in his mind between the candid interpretation of his friend's actions, and his own conviction deprives him of half the benefit of his understanding.|$|E
2500|$|An {{unidentified}} {{source said}} interrogations with Roof {{after his arrest}} determined he had been planning the attack for around six months, researched Emanuel AME Church, and targeted it because of its role in African-American history. One of the friends who briefly hid Roof's gun from him said, [...] "I don't think the church was his primary target because {{he told us he}} was going for the school. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> couldn't get into the school because of the security ... so I think he just settled for the church." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 1968, French [...] Régis Debray, who was {{captured}} in Bolivia while living with Che Guevara, gave a jailhouse interview where he also drew the comparison. According to Debray, Che (an atheist) [...] "was a mystic without a transcendent belief, a saint without a God." [...] Debray went on to tell interviewer Marlene Nadle of Ramparts Magazine that [...] "Che was a modern Christ, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> suffered a much harder passion. The Christ of 2,000 years ago died face-to-face with his God. But Che {{knew there was no}} God and that after his death nothing remains." ...|$|E

Ziva and Ray repair their relationship somewhat, and he gives her an empty ring box as a [...] "promise" [...] before leaving for a long-term assignment. Glasberg commented, [...] "Ziva and Ray are a little open-ended at the moment. There isn't any closure to it. We'll have to see where it leads, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was pretty clear that he has a job to do at the moment, and that's gonna be the primary focus for him." [...] The use of the ring box was criticized by viewers as an [...] "empty gesture".|$|E
2500|$|Khadr {{remains a}} {{controversial}} figure. Canadian attorney Dennis Edney, {{lawyer for the}} Khadr family, has challenged the assumption that Khadr {{was a member of}} al-Qaeda, saying in 2001 that he was [...] "really interested in obtaining one piece of evidence that would show indeed that Mr. Khadr was actually a terrorist. To me, it's just folklore." [...] Khadr's imam in Canada, Ali Hindy, spoke after his death, saying [...] "I don't think that he was al-Qaeda, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> felt that now he became part of Afghanistan." [...] His friends described him as being [...] "proud of [...] Canadian citizen". Some politicians and media have suggested that he disliked the country.|$|E
2500|$|Sam Kellerman was 29 years old. In {{speaking}} about his brother, Max Kellerman recalls that [...] " [...] was a creative genius... He {{was the best}} writer for his age I've ever read. I used to tell him, 'I'll {{always be able to}} get someone to pay me for talking, and you'll always be able to get someone to pay you for writing.' When it came to writing, I felt like Salieri to Sam's Mozart. Sam wanted to direct film, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was fated to write and be in front of the camera. He was starting to get work as an actor. He was in several national commercials. And acting wasn't even what he did best. Sam was a sure thing. It {{was just a matter of}} time before he made it big." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> don't. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> had a worse time, if that's any comfort, than Pony has. He has {{suffered}} {{the fate of}} all liars.

That's worse than having a tower fall on you, or pains in the stomach." ...|$|R
2500|$|In July 2014, Robinson, {{was sacked}} by Yorkshire for [...] "unprofessional actions"; in the 2014 season, {{he had made}} 7 T20 Blast {{appearances}} for Yorkshire, taking 6 wickets. Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie said of the situation that [...] "When a player consistently displays behaviour that isn’t professional, {{there has to be}} a point in time when you say ‘look, this isn’t really working, you’re obviously not that bothered about playing for the club’. That point came, and it was tough." [...] and that [...] "He’s got to learn about his game and about being a professional sportsman. I think there will be a future for him in the professional game, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> needs to learn a lot, and I think he can do it."

2500|$|As in the {{previous}} year, Parry was unable to break into Lancashire's team in the 2011 County Championship, but was a regular in the listA and twenty20 sides, playing 12 and 17 matches in the respective formats. His 13 listA wickets cost on average 32.30runs each, while his 17twenty20 wickets came at 24.94 runs apiece. Speaking in 2011, Gary Keedy explained that he is concerned that spin bowlers who learn how to bowl in the one-day format before playing first-class cricket will not become as effective bowlers as those who transition the other way round. He remarked that Parry [...] "is a very fine one-day bowler <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> takes more pride in bowling a maiden than he does bowling somebody out." [...] Parry spent that December with the England Performance Programme Squad, and coach Peter Moores noted [...] "when he worked with the England Performance Programme Squad... they measured the amount of spin he was getting on the ball {{and it was as}} high as almost anybody they had worked with." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2008, Hardwicke, in a turnabout {{from her}} initial underwhelmed {{reaction}} upon first seeing {{a photograph of}} Pattinson, enthused; [...] "The thing that’s great about him is he really does [...] feel like he’s otherworldly. I mean, he doesn’t look like a normal guy. And {{when you read the}} book, you think, ‘Who on the planet can live up to this description?’ <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> does. He’s just got that chiseled face that photographs exactly like it’s described in the book. When you read about the sculptured cheeks and chiseled jawbone and everything, it’s like, ‘Wow. Did she write this for Rob?" [...] Pattinson, in a detailed interview on how he perceives the character, admitted to having incorporated aspects of Rebel Without a Cause into his portrayal of Edward, assessing; [...] "I guess kind of the thing which I found interesting is that he is essentially the hero of this story but violently denies that he is the hero. Like at every point even when he does heroic things he still thinks that he’s [...] the most ridiculously selfish evil creature around. [...] He refuses to accept Bella’s love for him {{but at the same time}} can’t help but just kind of needs it, which is kind of what the essential storyline is." [...] Appearing at ComicCon in July 2008 while the film was in post-production, Pattinson surmised the Twilight experience as: [...] "bizarre. You kind of know that it is essentially the book. The book has so many obsessive, obsessively loyal fans. It's strange because people just immediately relate you to the character right away rather than you as an actor." [...] Pattinson reprised his role as Edward in all of the Twilight sequels.|$|E
