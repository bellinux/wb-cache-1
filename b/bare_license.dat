Furthermore, if a trademark owner does not maintain quality control and adequate supervision {{in relation to the}} manufacture and provision of products or services supplied by a licensee, such [...] "naked licensing" [...] will eventually adversely affect the owner's rights in the trademark. For US law see, ex. Eva's Bridal Ltd. v. Halanick Enterprises, Inc. 639 F.3d 788 (7th Cir. 2011). This proposition has, however, been watered down by the judgment of the House of Lords in the case of Scandecor Development AB v. Scandecor Marketing AB et al. [...] UKHL 21; wherein it has been held that the mere fact that a <b>bare</b> <b>license</b> (equivalent of the United States concept of a naked license) has been granted did not automatically mean that a trademark was liable to mislead.|$|E
40|$|Prior {{research}} suggests that equity joint ventures (JVs) are particularly effective vehicles for accessing complex technology. Different schools of thought have emphasized different reasons why joint ventures might support greater knowledge transfer than "bare" license agreements: incentive alignment, organizational embeddedness, and enhanced administrative controls. We probe and refine these theoretical perspectives, drawing out implications of the different theories for the extent and speed of alliance-related knowledge transfer, {{as well as for}} knowledge "leakage" in areas not directly related to alliance activities. Using a proprietary data set derived from regulatory filings with the Japanese government we test these implications in our empirical analysis of U. S. -Japan agreements. The picture that emerges from the analysis is one of particularly intense but contained knowledge transfer in equity joint ventures, relative to <b>bare</b> <b>license</b> agreements: knowledge transfers directly related to the alliance activity are enhanced in the JV, and the speed of integration into the Japanese firm's subsequent innovations also increases. In marked contrast, leakage of unrelated technology is significantly reduced. These findings suggest that administrative structures that reduce technology leakage are a key feature of the equity joint venture, a result that is inconsistent with a "pure" knowledge-based perspective on alliances. patent licensing, joint ventures, U.

5000|$|His CD, Storm — A Tree — My Mother’s Head, was self-released through <b>Bare's</b> <b>licensing</b> company, 30 Tigers/Naked Albino Recordings, in 2010. The {{title of}} the record was {{inspired}} by a January 2008 storm in Nashville that injured his mother. [...] "Mom was sitting on the couch, the last day of January in 2008, and there was a big, windy storm outside. And a big branch broke off halfway up the tree. It fell on the house, and literally split the house in two and landed exactly on top of her." [...] Another song on the record, [...] "The Sky Is The Ground," [...] is about a bicycle accident his son had when he was two.|$|R
