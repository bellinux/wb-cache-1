5|$|In Australian Aboriginal mythology for the Boorong {{people of}} Victoria, Capella was Purra, the kangaroo, pursued {{and killed by}} the nearby Gemini twins, Yurree (Castor) and Wanjel (Pollux). The Wardaman people of {{northern}} Australia knew the star as Yagalal, a ceremonial fish scale, related to Guwamba the <b>barramundi</b> (Aldebaran).|$|E
5|$|Several {{antibiotics}} {{have been}} used successfully to treat S.iniae infection in fish. Enrofloxacin, a quinolone antibiotic, {{has been used to}} great effect in hybrid striped bass (Morone chrysops× M.saxatilis), although evidence suggested the development of a resistant strain. Amoxicillin, erythromycin, furazolidone, and oxytetracycline have also been used (the last with varying success, only in <b>barramundi).</b> Vaccination against S.iniae has been attempted with limited success as it only provides up to 6 months' immunity.|$|E
5|$|Shy and {{difficult}} to approach, the nervous shark is harmless to humans. It is occasionally marketed for food. This species is susceptible to being caught incidentally in coastal gillnets, such as the <b>barramundi</b> (Lates calcarifer) gillnet fishery operating off northern Australia. It may also be caught on line gear and in prawn trawls. The Australian nervous shark population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by fishing activities, and there the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern. No data on the impact of fishing are available elsewhere in its range, and thus the IUCN has listed it overall under Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|S. iniae {{is highly}} {{pathogenic}} in freshwater, marine, and euryhaline fish, and is highly lethal: outbreaks {{may be associated}} with 30–50% mortality. It is, therefore, one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive aquaculture. In 1997, the global economic impact of S.iniae infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at US$100million (one-tenth of which in the United States). As of 2007, infection had been reported in 27 species of fish, including tilapia (genus Oreochromis and Tilapia), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Japanese amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and <b>barramundi</b> (Lates calcarifer, which can be an asymptomatic carrier). Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and goldfish (Carassius auratus) appear to be resistant. Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors (i.e. suboptimal temperature, poor water quality, crowding, handling, etc.) are most prone to S.iniae infection. Wild fish populations located both near and far from aquaculture operations have also proven susceptible to S.iniae infection.|$|E
25|$|Fishing {{is one of}} the recreations of Darwin locals. Visitors {{from around}} the world flock to Darwin aiming to catch the prized <b>barramundi,</b> an iconic fish for the region. The Mary River, Daly River, South and East Alligator River {{are just a few of}} the water bodies where the <b>barramundi</b> thrive.|$|E
25|$|Another {{well-known}} fishing spot 90 minutes SW of town is the Flora River, {{which also}} offers excellent <b>barramundi</b> fishing either by casting {{from the bank}} or by small boat. The Flora River is inhabited by saltwater crocodiles year-round and swimming is not permitted anytime.|$|E
25|$|The speartooth shark is {{not known}} to pose a danger to humans. Extremely rare like other river sharks, its global {{population}} has been estimated to number no more than 2,500 mature individuals, {{with no more than}} 250 in any subpopulation. This species is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries using gillnets and longlines, such as the <b>barramundi</b> (Lates calcarifer) gillnet fishery in Queensland (<b>barramundi</b> fisheries in New South Wales have been prohibited from rivers occupied by this species since 2005). Significant numbers are also taken by recreational anglers and bow fishers. Captured sharks might be eaten, used to bait crab pots, or discarded on land. Habitat degradation represents a third threat to the speartooth shark: the Fly River in Papua New Guinea has been severely affected by pollutants from mining activities, while proposed mining and dredging projects in the Port Musgrave area and uranium mining in Kakadu National Park are also of concern.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, reef cod {{and rock}} cod (a {{different}} variety from that {{used in the}} United Kingdom), <b>barramundi</b> or flathead (more expensive options), flake (a type of shark meat) or snapper (cheaper options), are commonly used. From the early 21st century, farmed basa imported from Vietnam and hoki have become common in Australian fish and chip shops. Other types of fish are also used based on regional availability.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{freshwater}} crocodile {{does not}} attack humans as potential prey, it can deliver a nasty bite. There {{have been very}} few incidents where people have been bitten whilst swimming with freshwater crocodiles, and others incurred during scientific study. An attack by a freshwater crocodile on a human was recorded at <b>Barramundi</b> Gorge (also known as Maguk) in Kakadu National Park and resulted in minor injuries; the victim managed to swim and {{walk away from the}} attack. He had apparently passed directly over the crocodile in the water. However, in general, it is still considered safe to swim with this species, so long as they are not aggravated.|$|E
25|$|Australia's 11 {{million square}} {{kilometre}} fishing zone {{is the third}} {{largest in the world}} and allows for easy access to seafood which significantly influences Australian cuisine. Clean ocean environments produce high quality seafoods. Lobster, prawns, tuna, salmon and abalone are the main ocean species harvested commercially, while aquaculture produces more than 60 species for consumption, including oysters, salmonoids, southern bluefin tuna, mussels, prawns, <b>barramundi,</b> yellowtail kingfish, and freshwater finifish. While inland river and lake systems are relatively sparse, they nevertheless provide some unique fresh water game fish and crustacea suitable for dining. Fishing and aquaculture constitute Australia's fifth most valuable agricultural industry after wool, beef, wheat and dairy.|$|E
25|$|While {{adults have}} few predators, baby {{saltwater}} crocodiles may {{fall prey to}} monitor lizards (occasionally, but not commonly, the numerous goanna in Australia, and the Asian water monitor (Varanus salvator) further north), predatory fish (especially the <b>barramundi</b> (Lates calcarifer)), wild boars, rats, various aquatic and raptorial birds (e.g. black-necked storks (Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus) and white-bellied sea eagles (Haliaeetus leucogaster)), pythons, larger crocodiles, and many other predators. Pigs and cattle also occasionally inadvertently trample eggs and nests on occasion and degrade habitat quality where found in numbers. Juveniles may also fall prey to tigers and leopards (Panthera pardus) {{in certain parts of}} their range, although encounters between these predators are rare, and cats are likely to avoid areas with saltwater crocodiles.|$|E
25|$|More than 5000 {{species of}} fish inhabit Australia's waterways; of these, 24% are endemic. However, because of the {{relative}} scarcity of freshwater waterways, Australia has only about 300 species of freshwater fish. Two families of freshwater fish have ancient origins: the arowana or bonytongues, and the Queensland lungfish. The Queensland lungfish is the most primitive of the lungfish, having evolved before Australia separated from Gondwana. One of the smallest freshwater fish, peculiar to the southwest of Western Australia, is the salamanderfish, which can survive desiccation in the dry season by burrowing into mud. Other families with a potentially Gondwanan origin include the Retropinnidae, Galaxiidae, Aplochitonidae and Percichthyidae. Apart from the ancient freshwater species, 70% of Australia's freshwater fish have affinities with tropical Indo-Pacific marine species that have adapted to freshwater. These species include freshwater lampreys, herrings, catfish, rainbowfish, and some 50 species of gudgeon, including the sleepy cod. Native freshwater game fish include the <b>barramundi,</b> Murray cod, and golden perch. Two species of endangered freshwater shark {{are found in the}} Northern Territory.|$|E
25|$|White rice is {{the staple}} of Bangladeshi cuisine, {{along with many}} {{vegetables}} and lentils. Rice preparations also include Bengali biryanis, pulaos, and khichuris. Mustard sauce, ghee, sunflower oil and fruit chutneys are widely used in Bangladeshi cooking. Fish is {{the main source of}} protein in Bengali cuisine. The Hilsa is the national fish and immensely popular across Bangladesh. Other kinds of fish eaten include rohu, butterfish, catfish, tilapia and <b>barramundi.</b> Fish eggs are a gourmet delicacy. Seafood holds an important place in Bengali cuisine, especially lobsters, shrimps and dried fish. Meat consumption includes chicken, beef, mutton, venison, duck and squab. In Chittagong, Mezban feasts are a popular tradition featuring the serving of hot beef curry. In Sylhet, the shatkora lemons are used to marinate dishes. In the tribal Hill Tracts, bamboo shoot cooking is prevalent. Bangladesh has a vast spread of desserts, including distinctive sweets like Rôshogolla, Rôshomalai, Chomchom, Mishti Doi and Kalojaam. Pithas are traditional boiled desserts made with rice or fruits. Halwa is served during religious festivities. Naan, paratha, luchi and bakarkhani are the main local breads. Black tea is offered to guests as a gesture of welcome. Kebabs are widely popular across Bangladesh, particularly seekh kebabs, chicken tikka and shashliks.|$|E

2500|$|Until very {{recently}} (i.e. late 2000s), Australian bass and estuary perch {{were placed in}} the Macquaria genus — {{one of a number of}} Australian genera in the Percichthyidae family — along with two species of native perch from the Murray-Darling Basin, golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) and Macquarie perch (Macquaria australasica). This revision to their taxonomy occurred in the late 1970s. Prior to that, Australian bass and estuary perch were placed in a separate genus, Percalates. [...] (Interestingly, the generic name Percalates is a compound of the generic names Perca and Lates, and arose from an early, erroneous taxonomic belief that Australian bass were an old world perch related to <b>barramundi</b> (Lates calcarifer)).|$|E
6000|$|The Silurian rocks, {{lower and}} upper, which in these islands have their chief {{development}} in Wales, {{and which are}} nearly thirty-eight thousand feet thick; and the Devonian or Old Red sandstone beds, which in the Fans of Brecon and Carmarthenshire attain a thickness of ten thousand feet, must be passed through in an upward direction before we reach {{the bottom of that}} Carboniferous Limestone of which I spoke in my last paper. We thus find on the Cambrian rocks forty- five thousand feet at least of newer rocks, in several cases lying unconformably on each other, showing thereby that the lower beds had been upheaved, and their edges worn off on a sea-shore, ere the upper were laid down on them; and throughout this vast thickness of rocks, the remains of hundreds of forms of animals, corals, shells, fish, older forms dying out in the newer rocks, and new ones taking their places in a steady succession of ever-varying forms, till those in the upper beds have become unlike those in the lower, and all are from the beginning more or less unlike any existing now on earth. [...] Whole families, indeed, disappear entirely, like the Trilobites, which seem to have swarmed in the Silurian seas, holding the same place there as crabs and shrimps do in our modern seas. They vanish after the period of the coal, and their place is taken by an allied family of Crustaceans, of which only one form (as far as I am aware) lingers now on earth, namely, the [...] "King Crab," [...] or Limulus, of the Indian Seas, a well-known animal, of which specimens may sometimes be seen alive in English aquaria. So perished in the lapse of those same ages, the armour-plated or [...] "Ganoid" [...] fish which Hugh Miller made so justly famous--and which made him so justly famous in return-- appearing first in the upper Silurian beds, and abounding in vast variety of strange forms in the old Red Sandstone, but gradually disappearing from the waters of the world, till their only representatives, as far as known, are the Lepidostei, or [...] "Bony Pikes," [...] of North America; the Polypteri of the Nile and Senegal; the Lepidosirens of the African lakes and Western rivers; the Ceratodus or <b>Barramundi</b> of Queensland (the two latter of which approach Amphibians), and one or two more fantastic forms, either rudimentary or degraded, which have lasted on here and there in isolated stations through long ages, comparatively unchanged while all the world is changed around them, and their own kindred, buried like the fossil Ceratodus of the Trias beneath thousands of feet of ancient rock, among creatures the likes whereof are not to be found now on earth. [...] And these are but two examples out of hundreds of the vast changes which have taken place in the animal life of the globe, between the laying down of the Cambrian slates and the present time.|$|E
