5|$|Research <b>by</b> <b>Matthew</b> Baron, David B. Norman, and Paul M. Barrett in 2017 {{suggested}} a radical revision of dinosaurian systematics.

They resurrected the clade Ornithoscelida to refer to the group containing Ornithischia and Theropoda. Dinosauria itself was re-defined as the last common ancestor of Triceratops horridus, Passer domesticus, Diplodocus carnegii, and all of its descendants, to ensure that sauropods and kin remain included as dinosaurs.|$|E
