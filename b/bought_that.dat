The Florida and Mid-South territories (along with those companies' rosters of wrestlers) were absorbed into WCW. Jim Crockett Promotions now owned NWA St. Louis, the Universal Wrestling Federation, Mid-Atlantic, Central States Wrestling, Championship Wrestling from Georgia and Championship Wrestling from Florida as well.|$|E
25|$|Minting {{began with}} 3-ruble coins, and 6-ruble and 12-ruble coins were added in 1829 and 1830, respectively. 1,371,691 3-ruble coins were minted, along with 14,847 6-ruble and 3,474 12-ruble coins. The first coin {{was sent to}} the {{prominent}} German scientist Alexander von Humboldt, who was previously asked to evaluate the use of platinum as a currency and confirm its price relative to silver.

25|$|On May 7, 1840, the New York State Legislature {{granted the}} {{railroad}} {{the right to}} extend into Westchester as the New York and Albany Railroad Company failed to build its line from the Harlem River to Albany. The necessary land for the extension was acquired due to the diplomatic skills of Gouverneur Morris of Morrisania, {{who was able to}} convince landowners that their prejudices against the railroad were unjust. The New York and Albany Railroad had been granted its charter on April 17, 1832, allowing it to build a single or double-track line from Albany to New York along the Harlem River. Ground on this line was broken in various areas, and some portions were completed. The line was not being completed as quickly as its charter said it would, so the New York State Legislature granted it multiple extensions to allow for the work to be completed. The last time an extension was granted was on April 11, 1842. The New York and Harlem Railroad <b>bought</b> <b>that</b> company for $35,000 on March 9, 1846, as it had failed to make any progress on the construction of the line. The right-of-way and land for that line was sold as part of this transaction, on which, it built its line into Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, and Columbia Counties.|$|E
500|$|The depot {{was reached}} on 28 January. Wild, ill with dysentery, {{was unable to}} pull or to eat {{anything}} but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, a gesture that moved Wild to write: [...] "BY GOD I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have <b>bought</b> <b>that</b> one biscuit". A few days later, {{the rest of the}} party were struck with severe enteritis, the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal. Fortunately a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Great Southern Journey", as Frank Wild called it, {{began on}} 29 October 1908. On 9 January 1909, Shackleton and three companions (Wild, Eric Marshall and Jameson Adams) reached a new Farthest South {{latitude}} of 88°23'S, a point only [...] from the Pole. En route the South Pole party discovered the Beardmore Glacier (named after Shackleton's patron) [...] {{and became the}} first persons to see and travel on the South Polar Plateau. Their return journey to McMurdo Sound was a race against starvation, on half-rations for much of the way. At one point, Shackleton gave his one biscuit allotted for the day to the ailing Frank Wild, who wrote in his diary: [...] "All the money that was ever minted would not have <b>bought</b> <b>that</b> biscuit and the remembrance of that sacrifice will never leave me". They arrived at Hut Point just in time to catch the ship.|$|E

500|$|Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter {{summed up}} WrestleMania XXX as a [...] "very newsworthy show {{to say the}} least". Daniel Bryan's first match was {{described}} as a long technical one, and although Meltzer did not consider it [...] "a match of the year or probably even the week", it [...] "was the caliber of a good PPV main event". Triple H's post-match attack on Bryan was said to be a [...] "very basic" [...] storyline [...] "but it's also exactly what they should have done". Bryan's second match in the main event was described as [...] "really great" [...] with lots of twists and turns, while the match result was [...] "again exactly what they should have done" [...] and [...] "the crowd reacted the way you would expect". Meltzer thought that [...] "the people just weren't into" [...] the Undertaker's match as [...] "nobody <b>bought</b> <b>that</b> Lesnar could win". Meanwhile, he felt that the Undertaker's departure was [...] "certainly teased like a retirement". For the battle royal, Meltzer noted the lack of (surprise) entrants such as Rob Van Dam, Alexander Rusev, Christian, or Wade Barrett. In other notes, Meltzer described the strong fan support for Cesaro and also labelled Cena's win as a [...] "genuine upset".|$|E
500|$|While some reviewers {{regard the}} novel as a thriller, others {{see it as an}} example of post-millennial science fiction with stories set in the [...] "technocultural future-present". Some reviewers note that the novel furthers the post-millennial trend in science fiction of {{illustrating}} society's inability to imagine a definitive future and the use of technologies once considered advanced or academic now commonplace within society and its vernacular. Gibson said that the only science fiction elements are [...] "he Footage and Cayce's special talents" [...] but that he [...] "never <b>bought</b> <b>that</b> conceit that science fiction is about the future". Dennis Danvers explained the use of science fiction as a narrative strategy: cience fiction, in effect, has become a narrative strategy, a way of approaching story, in which not only characters must be invented, but the world and its ways as well, without resorting to magic or the supernatural, where the fantasy folks work. A realist wrestling with the woes of the middle class can leave the world out of it by and large except for an occasional swipe at the shallowness of suburbia. A science fiction writer must invent the world where the story takes place, often from the ground up, a process usually called world-building. In other words, in a science fiction novel, the world itself is a distinctive and crucial character in the plot, without whom the story could not take place, whether it's the world of Dune or Neuromancer or 1984. The world is the story as much as the story is in the world. Part of Gibson's point ... is {{that we live in a}} time of such accelerated change and layered realities, that we're all in that boat, like it or not. A novel set in the [...] "real world" [...] now has to answer the question, [...] "Which one?" ...|$|E
