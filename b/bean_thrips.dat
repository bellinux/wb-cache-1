40|$|Three {{insecticide}} {{active ingredients}} (cyfluthrin, indoxacarb, and zetacypermethrin) were evaluated for their efficacy on several insects found in fall alfalfa {{in the low}} desert. Both liquid and wettable formulations were included for both cyfluthrin and zetacypermethrin, and four rates of indoxacarb were applied. Insect pressures were fairly low throughout the study. Pyrethroid chemistries (cyfluthrin, zetacypermethrin) provided excellent control of threecornered alfalfa hoppers for seven days after application while cyfluthrin applications resulted in lowest numbers of pale striped flea beetles {{during the same time}} period. All chemistries resulted in excellent control of the South American <b>bean</b> <b>thrips</b> (Caliothrips phaseoli). Indoxacarb treatments resulted in significantly increased levels of spotted alfalfa aphid, thought due to a reduction of big eye bugs noted with usage of this chemistry. Wettable formulations of both cyfluthrin and zetacypermethrin resulted in significant hay yield increases (0. 1 tons/acre) when compared with their liquid formulations. An inverse yield trend was noted with indoxacarb rate. Usage of the liquid cyfluthrin chemistry also resulted in an unexplained quality decrease in this experiment...|$|E
40|$|Male sexual aggregations are {{a common}} territorial, mating-related or resource-based, {{behaviour}} observed in diverse organisms, including insects such as thrips. The influence of factors such as plant substrate, time of day, and geographic location on aggregation of thrips is uncertain, therefore we monitored the dispersion {{of male and female}} <b>bean</b> flower <b>thrips</b> (BFT), Megalurothrips sjostedti (Trybom) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), on cowpea, Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. (Fabaceae), over three cowpea growth stages and across three cowpea-growing areas of Kenya. Our results indicated that for all the crop growth stages, the density of BFTs varied over the time of day, with higher densities at 10 : 00, 13 : 00, and 16 : 00 hours than at 07 : 00 hours. Thrips densities did not differ among blocks at the budding stage, but they did at peak flowering and podding stages. Dispersion indices suggested that both male and female BFTs were aggregated. Active male aggregation occurred only on green plant parts and it varied across blocks, crop stages, and locations. Similarly, active female aggregation was observed in peak flowering and podding stages. Such active aggregation indicates a semiochemical or behaviour-mediated aggregation. Identification of such a semiochemical may offer new opportunities for refining monitoring and management strategies for BFT on cowpea, the most important grain legume in sub-Saharan Africa. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} host plants on Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) body size was investigated. Thrips {{from three different}} populations, from the Netherlands, Italy, and USA, achieved greater body sizes when reared on cucumber than on <b>bean.</b> The same <b>thrips</b> grew larger when reared on susceptible than on resistant cucumber. On the latter, reproduction was reduced, suggesting that smaller thrips have a lower reproduction. However, no evidence was found for a correlation between size and reproduction in experiments with thrips from four different populations, from the Netherlands, New Zealand, France, and USA that differed significantly in body size. Also when individual thrips from the four populations were tested, there was no correlation between size and reproduction. It is concluded that resistant cucumber affects both size and reproduction of F. occidentalis. However, lower reproduction in general is not associated with smaller body size...|$|R
40|$|Breeding for {{resistance}} to biotic and abiotic stresses of global importance in common bean is reviewed {{with emphasis on}} development and application of marker-assisted selection (MAS). The implementation and adoption of MAS in {{breeding for disease resistance}} is advanced compared to the implementation of MAS for insect and abiotic stress resistance. Highlighted examples of breeding in common bean using molecular markers reveal the role and success of MAS in gene pyramiding, rapidly deploying resistance genes via marker-assisted backcrossing, enabling simpler detection and selection of resistance genes in absence of the pathogen, and contributing to simplified breeding of complex traits by detection and indirect selection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) with major effects. The current status of MAS in breeding {{for resistance}} to angular leaf spot, anthracnose, Bean common mosaic and Bean common mosaic necrosis viruses, Beet curly top virus, Bean golden yellow mosaic virus, common bacterial blight, halo bacterial blight, rust, root rots, and white mold is reviewed in detail. Cumulative mapping of disease resistance traits has revealed new resistance gene clusters while adding to others, and reinforces the co-location of QTL conditioning resistance with specific resistance genes and defense-related genes. Breeding for resistance to insect pests is updated for bean pod weevil (Apion), bruchid seed weevils, leafhopper, <b>thrips,</b> <b>bean</b> fly, and whitefly, including the use of arcelin proteins as selectable markers for resistance to bruchid seed weevils. Breeding for resistance to abiotic stresses concentrates on drought, low soil phosphorus, and improved symbiotic nitrogen fixation. The combination of root growth and morphology traits, phosphorus uptake mechanisms, root acid exudation, and other traits in alleviating phosphorus deficiency, and identification of numerous QTL of relatively minor effect associated with each trait, reveals the complexity to be addressed in breeding for abiotic stress resistance in common bean.
