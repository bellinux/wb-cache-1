5|$|A $30,000 supersedeas bond {{was issued}} in August 1965 as the United Bond Insurance Company {{continued}} to dispute {{the payment of}} Kinne's original $25,000 bond. The supersedeas bond allowed the company to defer payment of the $25,000 bond until a ruling on the matter was handed down by the Missouri Supreme Court, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> court upheld the bond's forfeiture, the $25,000 was paid to the State of Missouri in October 1965. The United Bond Insurance Company later filed suit against Kinne's family to recover {{the cost of the}} bail, lawyer's fees, and searching for Kinne after her escape.|$|E

5|$|Newspapers {{across the}} country defended the union workers, and the trio decided to assassinate Frick. They {{believed}} the assassination would arouse the working class to unite and revolt against the capitalist system. Berkman's plan was to assassinate Frick and then kill himself; Goldman was to explain Berkman's motives after his death; and Aronstam was to follow Berkman {{in the event that}} he failed in his mission. Emulating his Russian idols, Berkman tried to make a bomb, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> failed, he went to Pittsburgh with the plan to use a handgun.|$|E

5|$|The F-4C {{variant of}} the PhantomII was among the {{aircraft}} evaluated by the RAAF in 1963 {{as part of the}} project to replace its English Electric Canberra bombers. The F-111 was selected, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> project was delayed in the late 1960s due to long-running technical faults with the aircraft, the RAAF determined that the F-4E PhantomII would be the best alternative. As a result of continued problems with the F-111s, the Australian and United States Governments negotiated an agreement in 1970 whereby the RAAF leased 24 F-4Es and their support equipment from the USAF.|$|E
5|$|Andersen went to sea at age 15, {{and later}} found {{work as a}} mason's assistant. On 7November 1916 he married Lovise Kristine Klausen, {{who worked as a}} {{waitress}} at a restaurant frequented by Andersen. They soon got an apartment at Torshov and had a son. Andersen got a better-paid job, laying the foundation for the headquarters of Oslo Lysverker, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> job was done he had to seek day-to-day work at the harbour. After an upturn during the First World War, Norway's financial situation again turned for the worse, no-one would hire a man with an institutional background, and he was out of work. He made a last-ditch attempt to make money, buying liquor in Tønsberg and selling it on the black market in Kristiania, but this was not enough for his wife, who left him to pursue a more financially secure future.|$|E
5|$|In 1816 {{his wife}} Sarah died, {{although}} {{the cause is}} unrecorded. Evans remarried two years later in April 1818 to Hetty Ward, who was many years his junior and {{the daughter of the}} New York innkeeper. In these last years Evans lived in New York with his new wife. In early 1819 Evans developed an inflammation of the lungs and after a month of illness, died on April 15, 1819. Just four days prior, on April 11, news had reached him in New York that the Mars Works in Philadelphia had burned down, though his sons-in-law were committed to re-establishing the business and did so further outside of the city. Evans was buried at Zion Episcopal Church in Manhattan, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> church was sold his body was moved several times until finally resting in 1890 in an unmarked common grave at Trinity Cemetery, Broadway at 157th Street, New York City.|$|E

5|$|While {{food was}} {{extremely}} {{hard to come}} by, an even more pressing need was obtaining drinking water. Thirst {{and the search for}} water are mentioned in most of the Robinsons' memoirs. The most common sources originally included toilet cisterns, boilers, and standing water found inside bathtubs. As these ran out, those in hiding were forced to risk sneaking access to wells, which were often guarded by German soldiers. Some memoirs describe long periods observing a particular well and waiting for a chance to obtain a quick drink. Another method involved obtaining polluted sewer water from the canals, and then filtering it through coals wrapped in rags. Generally, records indicate that whatever scant water supplies existed were shared fairly among individuals hiding as a group. In at least one instance, one person was unable to withstand the thirst and drank the whole group's water supply. As a result, Jakub Wiśnia, a former Gęsiówka inmate and after its liberation, a Home Army soldier, was court-martialed by his fellow group members and sentenced to death. The execution was to be postponed until after liberation, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> occurred, the Robinsons were so overwhelmed with joy, the crime was forgiven and the sentence was never mentioned again.|$|E

He had expected Rosecrans to attack on December 30, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> did not happen, his plan was to drive Hardee's corps and the cavalry under Brig. Gen. John A. Wharton deep into the Union rear. He began moving the bulk of Hardee's corps across the river to his left flank to prepare for the next morning's attack. This left Breckinridge's division in reserve on the east side of the river on the high ground.|$|E
25|$|Hartford {{was about}} to open a new, modern {{downtown}} arena and convention center, the Hartford Civic Center. The city had hoped to get an American Basketball Association team as the main tenant, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> fell through, city leaders {{got in touch with}} the Whalers. The area, aside from various minor league teams in New Haven, had been largely bereft of professional hockey until the Whalers' arrival. The Civic Center was still being finished when the 1974–75 season began, so the Whalers played {{the first part of the}} 1974–75 season at The Big E Coliseum in West Springfield, Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|The DBR4 {{was largely}} based on the DB3S sportscar, and {{borrowed}} that vehicle's basic chassis and engine layout. Although it was tested as early as 1957, the DBR4 did not make its World Championship debut until the 1959 Dutch Grand Prix, driven by Roy Salvadori and Carroll Shelby. However, its long gestation period meant {{that by the time}} it finally entered competition much of its concept and technology had been superseded, and the car was not a success. The DBR4 was replaced by the lighter Aston Martin DBR5/250 in early 1960, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> car also failed to provide competitive results Aston Martin abandoned Formula One to concentrate on their more successful sports car projects.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 19th century Delaware {{politics}} {{was characterized by}} a conservative downstate, agrarian and small business majority, in opposition to a Wilmington based industrialist minority. This majority was led into the Whig Party by John M. Clayton, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> party broke up {{over the issue of}} slavery, generally moved over to a conservative Democratic Party. As the sectional issues intensified with the coming of the Civil War, this majority became impossibly conflicted between its certain loyalty to the Union and its equally certain view that decisions about property, including slaves, belonged with the states. The result was first an effort by many to find a non-existent middle ground, and then, with a much diminished majority, entry into constant and bitter conflict with the Republican minority centered in Wilmington and supported by the Federal government.|$|E
25|$|Damages may be {{general or}} consequential. General damages are those damages which {{naturally}} flow from {{a breach of}} contract. Consequential damages are those damages which, although not naturally flowing from a breach, are naturally supposed by both parties {{at the time of}} contract formation. An example would be when someone rents a car to get to a business meeting, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> person arrives to pick up the car, it is not there. General damages would be the cost of renting a different car. Consequential damages would be the lost business if that person was unable to get to the meeting, if both parties knew the reason the party was renting the car. However, there is still a duty to mitigate the losses. The fact that the car was not there does not give the party a right to not attempt to rent another car.|$|E
25|$|In German and Italian hands, the French fleet {{would have}} been a grave threat to Britain and the British Government was unable to take this risk. In order to neutralise the threat, Winston Churchill ordered that the French ships should rejoin the Allies, agree to be put out of use in a British, French or neutral port or, as a last resort, be {{destroyed}} by British attack (Operation Catapult). The Royal Navy attempted to persuade the French Navy to agree to these terms, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> failed they attacked the French Navy at Mers El Kébir and Dakar (see), on July 3, 1940. This caused bitterness and division in France, particularly in the Navy, and discouraged many French soldiers from joining the Free French forces in Britain and elsewhere. Also, the attempt to persuade Vichy French forces in Dakar to join De Gaulle failed. (See West African campaign and Operation Menace).|$|E
