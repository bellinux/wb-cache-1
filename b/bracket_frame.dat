50|$|Local Sydney Living Infrastructure specialist, Junglefy {{worked with}} French {{botanist}} Patrick Blanc and Watpac {{to deliver the}} world’s tallest vertical garden at 130m high (over 1120 square metres). Junglefy engineered the support <b>brackets</b> and aluminium <b>frames</b> and modularised the whole project. The installation methodology {{was the first of}} its kind anywhere in the world for this green facade system. Junglefy were also responsible for fabrication, assembly and installation of Blanc’s vertical garden, ensuring it met Australian building standards and was integrated into the 28-month building program, including the installation of the support <b>brackets,</b> <b>frames,</b> sheeting, irrigation, felt and plants. Junglefy continue to be responsible for the ongoing maintenance and plant health of the entire site, much of this work is completed via a swing stage regularly checking on structure, plant health, pests and diseases as well as pruning and removal of rubbish.|$|R
5000|$|In {{two-dimensional}} {{works of}} art, such as painting, printmaking, photography or bas-relief, repoussoir ( [...] , pushing back) is an object along {{the right or}} left foreground that directs the viewer's eye into the composition by <b>bracketing</b> (<b>framing)</b> the edge. It became popular with Mannerist and Baroque artists, and is found frequently in Dutch seventeenth-century landscape paintings. Jacob van Ruisdael, for example, often included a tree along one side to enclose the scene (see illustration). Figures are also commonly employed as repoussoir devices by artists such as Paolo Veronese, Peter Paul Rubens and Impressionists such as Gustave Caillebotte.|$|R

25|$|The {{process of}} the text and {{conversation}} exchange is reciprocal: text needs conversation and vice versa for the process of communication to occur. Text, or content, must have context to be effective and a conversation, or discourse, needs to have a beginning, middle and end. Individuals create the beginning, middle and end by using punctuation, <b>bracketing</b> or <b>framing.</b> When conversation is coupled with text, or meaning, communication occurs. Taylor submits this process is a translation process of: translation of text to conversation and the translation of conversation into text.|$|R
5000|$|The Thompson {{bottom bracket}} uses {{adjustable}} spindle cones and cups {{pressed into the}} bottom bracket shell like the Ashtabula bottom bracket. Unlike the Ashtabula crank, the non-drive side crank is removable, allowing for a smaller bottom <b>bracket</b> shell. <b>Frames</b> with either Italian or English bottom bracket shell diameters (independent of threading) may be fitted with Thompson bottom brackets. [...] Thompson bottom brackets are rare. The design {{is similar to a}} typical hub bearing and theoretically supports the load better, but is hard to seal effectively against dirt and water.|$|R

5|$|To {{reach the}} chapel's ceiling, Michelangelo {{designed}} his own scaffold, a flat wooden platform on brackets built out from {{holes in the}} wall {{near the top of}} the windows, rather than being built up from the floor. Mancinelli speculates that this was in order to cut the cost of timber. According to Michelangelo's pupil and biographer Ascanio Condivi, the <b>brackets</b> and <b>frame</b> that supported the steps and flooring were all put in place at the beginning of the work and a lightweight screen, possibly cloth, was suspended beneath them to catch plaster drips, dust, and splashes of paint. Only half the building was scaffolded at a time and the platform was moved as the painting was done in stages. The areas of the wall covered by the scaffolding still appear as unpainted areas across the bottom of the lunettes. The holes were re-used to hold scaffolding in the latest restoration.|$|R

40|$|The frame {{response}} of occupied forward-facing wheelchairs secured by a surrogate four-point strap-type tiedown was characterized {{using data from}} 575 WC 19 frontal-impact sled tests. Powerbase, manual, and stroller-type wheelchairs with fabric or planar seats and seatbacks were tested. Loading mechanisms that caused damage to the base frame were identified {{and the effect of}} seating system type was considered. The most frequent types of wheelchair frame damage were failure or deformation of the rear securement <b>brackets</b> or <b>frame</b> members to which these are attached, main frame members, front caster assembly, footrests, seat tilt and seatback recline mechanisms, and seatback canes. Wheelchairs with fabric seats were more likely to experience frame damage, but there was no relationship between seatback type and frame damage. There was no evidence of a relationship between base frame damage and wheelchair rotation. The patterns of frame damage and the relationships between damage and seating system type will be used to guide the design of a reusable surrogate wheelchair seating system (SWCSS) for use in frontal-impact tests of wheelchair base frames independent of commercial seating systems...|$|R

50|$|Bicycle frames {{utilizing}} pressed bearing standards do {{not have}} any threads inside the bottom bracket shell. The bottom bracket is pressed directly into the frame. Using pressed in standards allows frame manufacturers greater flexibility in frame design that many times offers greater stiffness and weight reductions. The current pressed-bearing standards (and developed by) are: BB30 (Cannondale), PF30 (SRAM), BB90 & BB95 (Trek), BB86 & BB92 (Shimano), BB79 (Cervelo’s BBRight), and BB386EVO (FSA and BH bicycles). In BB30, BB90 & BB95 systems: the bearings are pressed directly into the frame. For PF30, BB86 & BB92, BB79, and BB386EVO; the bearing is housed in a nylon plastic cup that is pressed into the <b>frame’s</b> bottom <b>bracket</b> shell. Pressed in standards usually require two-piece cranksets where the spindle is attached to one of the crankarms. Due to fixed spindle length and diameter, cranksets designed for one pressed standard may not be compatible with another. For example, a crankset made specifically for BB30 will not fit in a BB86 bottom <b>bracket</b> and <b>frame.</b> There are other instances where adapters can be used to fit a crankset made for one standard into another. For example, a Shimano (two piece Hollowtech II 24mm OD spindle) road crankset can fit into a BB30 bottom bracket shell (42mm ID) using aftermarket adapters.|$|R

50|$|Floating Power was a {{technology}} {{developed in the}} 1920s by the United States automobile firm of Chrysler, credited mostly to the engineering of Owen Ray Skelton. It was a new means of attaching an engine to its chassis, {{with the intention of}} reducing vibration. Four-cylinder engines of the day started and rode rather roughly, transmitting the torque to the whole chassis. By attaching the engine at only two points ("fore-and-aft"), on two points defining an axis that passes through the engine's center of mass, the engine would be able to rotate slightly about this axis and reduce the transmission of torsional vibration to the chassis. One mounting attachment was at the upper front of the engine, directly below the water pump. The rear mount was under the transmission case. A transverse spring went {{from the bottom of the}} engine to a snubber <b>bracket</b> on the <b>frame</b> rail to limit the rotational travel of the engine. The bracket was lined with rubber.|$|R
