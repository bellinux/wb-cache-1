2500|$|The {{cotton-top}} tamarin {{has a long}} sagittal crest, consisting of white hairs, from forehead to nape flowing over the shoulders. [...] The skin of the face is black with gray or white bands located above the eyes. These bands continue {{along the edge of}} the face down to the jaw. Tamarins are generally divided into three groups by their facial characteristics: hairy-faced, mottled-faced, and bare-faced. The {{cotton-top tamarin}} has fine white hairs covering its face, but they are so fine as to appear naked, thus is considered a <b>bare-faced</b> <b>tamarin.</b> Its lower canine teeth are longer than its incisors, creating the appearance of tusks. Like other callitrichids, the cotton-top tamarin has two molar teeth on each side of its jaw, not three like other New World monkeys.|$|E
