25|$|The {{decline of}} the Roman Empire saw the {{classical}} cities fall into ruin, a process hastened by the Vandals' destructive sweep through North Africa in the 5th century. When the Empire returned (now as East Romans) as part of Justinian's reconquests of the 6th century, {{efforts were made to}} strengthen the old cities, but it was only a last gasp before they collapsed into disuse. Cyrenaica, which had remained an outpost of the Byzantine Empire during the Vandal period, also took on the characteristics of an armed camp. Unpopular Byzantine governors imposed <b>burdensome</b> <b>taxation</b> to meet military costs, while the towns and public services—including the water system—were left to decay. By the beginning of the 7th century, Byzantine control over the region was weak, Berber rebellions were becoming more frequent, and there was little to oppose Muslim invasion.|$|E
2500|$|For Justice Blackmun, {{the issue}} was whether the Montana {{severance}} tax constituted a [...] "tailored tax" [...] {{in violation of the}} test in Complete Auto Transit. He was deeply troubled by the fact that Montana had control over one-quarter of the nation's coal reserves and nearly total control of the nation's low-sulfur coal reserves, and that most of these reserves lay under land controlled by the federal government. In addition, Blackmun argued there was a [...] "tension" [...] in the Court's ruling as to whether interstate commerce should be relatively unhindered from interference by state taxation and whether states should be allowed to recoup costs associated with interstate commerce. Blackmun agreed with the majority that the tax was not discriminatory. But he disagreed that the tax did not burden interstate commerce, characterizing the majority's ruling as making Montana free [...] "to tax this coal at 100% or even 1,000% of value, should it choose to do so." [...] Blackmun characterized the majority's decision as [...] "mechanical," [...] and claimed it was not in step with prior Court rulings on <b>burdensome</b> <b>taxation.</b> Blackmun further argued that the Montana severance tax was a [...] "tailored tax" [...] because it only taxed coal destined for interstate commerce, and thus deserved stricter scrutiny under the Complete Auto test. Accordingly, given the economic conditions and importance of national energy policy, Blackmun would have remanded the case for trial for further determination of these issues. Blackmun agreed with the majority, however, that there was no Supremacy Clause issue.|$|E

50|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the end of World War I, many of the Kisii (AbaGusii) became followers of Mumboism in growing numbers. Some factors contributing to this were frustration with the colonial government due to deteriorating agricultural, trade and health conditions among the Kisii people, fluctuating currency value, and the colonial administration's increasingly <b>burdensome</b> demands concerning <b>taxation,</b> labour owed to the colonial government, and requirements for registration.|$|R
5000|$|The actual {{significance}} of Eureka upon Australia's politics is not decisive. It has been variously {{interpreted as a}} revolt of free men against imperial tyranny, of independent free enterprise against <b>burdensome</b> <b>taxation,</b> of labour against a privileged ruling class, or {{as an expression of}} republicanism. In his 1897 travel book Following the Equator, American writer Mark Twain wrote of the Eureka Rebellion: ... I think it may be called the finest thing in Australasian history. It was a revolution—small in size; but great politically; it was a strike for liberty, a struggle for principle, a stand against injustice and oppression. ... It is another instance of a victory won by a lost battle. It adds an honorable page to history; the people know it and are proud of it. They keep green the memory of the men who fell at the Eureka stockade, and Peter Lalor has his monument.|$|E

Resolved, {{that the}} {{taxation}} {{of the people}} by themselves, or by persons chosen by themselves to represent them, who can only know what taxes the {{people are able to}} bear, or the easiest method of raising them, and must themselves be affected by every tax laid on the people, is the only security against a <b>burdensome</b> <b>taxation,</b> and the distinguishing characteristic of British freedom, without which the ancient constitution cannot exist.4. Resolved, that His Majesty's liege people of this his most ancient and loyal colony have without interruption enjoyed the inestimable right of being governed by such laws, respecting their internal policy and taxation, as are derived from their own consent, with the approbation of their sovereign, or his substitute; and that the same has never been forfeited or yielded up, but has been constantly recognized by the kings and people of Great Britain.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{important}} events occurred in 1917 that concerned the Sebastian Inlet. One {{of these events}} was when Mrs. C. H. Holderman started another newspaper in Brevard county after selling {{the one she had}} published in Manatee county for some years. On March 22 the first edition of her new publication, the [...] "Cocoa Tribune" [...] hit the streets. Holderman was 1 of only 3 women in Florida who edited a newspaper at that time. She was an outspoken advocate of women's suffrage and unafraid of taking a stand on other controversial subjects as well. She exhibited an unrestrained disdain for <b>burdensome</b> <b>taxation</b> and used the pages of her publication to relay her feelings on the subject to her readers. Holderman's [...] "Cocoa Tribune" [...] came out every Thursday. In her 3rd edition, that of April 5, 1917 a large front page article appeared that openly called for the digging of several inlets along Brevard's coastline, including one at Sebastian.|$|E
