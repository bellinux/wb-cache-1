5|$|By the mid-1950s, HIAG {{established}} {{an image that}} separated the Waffen-SS from other SS formations and shifted responsibility for crimes that could not <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> to the Allgemeine-SS (security and police), the SS-Totenkopfverbände and the Einsatzgruppen. The Waffen-SS was thus successfully integrated into {{the myth of the}} clean Wehrmacht.|$|E
5|$|The Electronic Frontier Foundation {{acknowledged}} that the companies were within their legal rights to terminate their contracts with The Daily Stormer, but that the move set a dangerous precedent in which other political views including left-wing ones could <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> legal protection.

5|$|Due to the {{failures}} of the ratings agencies, European regulators obtained new powers to supervise ratings agencies. With the creation of the European Supervisory Authority in January 2011 the EU set up a whole range of new financial regulatory institutions, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which became the EU's single credit-ratings firm regulator. Credit-ratings companies have to comply with the new standards or will <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> operation on EU territory, says ESMA Chief Steven Maijoor.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{where an}} MP {{of the ruling}} party vacates his or her seat, a {{counterpart}} in a neighbouring ward may take over his or her functions, thus {{eliminating the need for}} a by-election. However, this arrangement may not work if an opposition MP vacates his or her seat and no by-election is called, because of the dearth of opposition MPs in Parliament. Therefore, the voters in the opposition ward will <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> of representation until the next general election.|$|E
5|$|In Didden v. Village of Port Chester (2006), an {{unrelated}} case {{brought about by}} the same town's actions, Sotomayor joined a unanimous panel's summary order to uphold a trial court's dismissal – due to a statute of limitations lapse – of a property owner's objection to his land being condemned for a redevelopment project. The ruling further said that even without the lapse, the owner's petition would <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> due to application of the Supreme Court's recent Kelo v. City of New London ruling. The Second Circuit's reasoning drew criticism from libertarian commentators.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, the Deep River Historical Society of Deep River, Connecticut {{discovered}} {{a photo of}} the light and began to research its history.

In 2000, the plan was rejected by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a student}} has met the three course requirement, {{he or she}} is then {{eligible}} to formally apply to the ALM program. Typically applicants must submit a completed application, proof of an accredited bachelor's degree (or foreign equivalent) plus transcripts, resume, two essays, and a nonrefundable application fee. Some programs require additional specific classes {{to be part of the}} initial three before formal admission. Students will <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> admission indefinitely if they fail to earn a grade of B after twice enrolling in the Proseminar course.|$|E
5|$|Rights of {{the poor}} was another area that was {{expanded}} by the ACLU. In 1966 and again in 1968, activists within the ACLU encouraged the organization to adopt a policy overhauling the welfare system, and guaranteeing low-income families a baseline income; but the ACLU board did not approve the proposals. The ACLU {{played a key role}} in the 1968 King v. Smith decision, where the Supreme Court ruled that welfare benefits for children could not <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> by a state simply because the mother cohabited with a boyfriend.|$|E

5|$|The West German {{authorities}} {{were aware of}} the high profile of the prisoners {{and the fact that the}} group had numerous sympathisers, so that terrorist acts aiming at the liberation of the Munich attackers were feared. Aircraft of (then) national airline Lufthansa or its Israeli counterpart El Al were identified as likely targets. On 9 September, an anonymous letter was received claiming that such a hijacking was indeed imminent, which prompted the Federal Ministry of the Interior (then led by Hans-Dietrich Genscher) to consider whether citizens of Arab states should <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> boarding of Lufthansa flights.|$|E
5|$|This wall is {{visited by}} all our {{brothers}} on every feast and festival; {{and the large}} space at its foot is often so densely filled up, that all cannot perform their devotions here at the same time. It is also visited, though by less numbers, on every Friday afternoon, and by some nearly every day. No one is molested in these visits by the Mahomedans, as {{we have a very}} old firman from the Sultan of Constantinople that the approach shall not <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> to us, though the Porte obtains for this privilege a special tax, which is, however, quite insignificant.|$|E
5|$|After {{the cavalry}} {{breakthrough}} on the coast, the XXI Corps would advance {{to capture the}} headquarters of the Ottoman Eighth Army at Tulkarm and cut the railway lines. Sections of the lateral rail line in the Judean Hills between Tulkarm and Nablus and a branch of the Jezreel Valley railway, were to <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> to the Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies. These lines, including the important railway junction at Messudieh, transported their supplies into the Judean Hills. The British infantry divisions were to continue their attack by swinging north–east, pivoting on their right to push the defenders back out of their trenches away from the coast and back into the Judean Hills towards Messudieh.|$|E

5|$|As {{the main}} attack {{developed}} on the 27th, the South Vietnamese General Assembly {{handed over the}} presidency to General Dương Văn Minh, who was sworn in the following day. It was widely assumed that Minh, who had no history of aggressive action against the communists, {{would be able to}} establish a cease-fire and re-open negotiations. Such hope was unrealistic. Their opponent, {{for the first time since}} the First Indochina War, held the upper hand on the battlefield and victory was within reach, regardless of any political changes in Saigon. They would not <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> victory, the only thing for which they had striven for over 30 years. The hope that the communists would make the same mistake they did 21 years prior by complying with the Geneva Agreements while the US and State of Vietnam did not was futile.|$|E
5|$|Halliday's {{place in}} the Aberdeen Hall of Fame was secured after the war when {{he became the first}} manager to bring {{national}} trophies to Pittodrie. Aberdeen won the Southern League Cup in the 1945–46 season, defeating Rangers 3–2 at Hampden. They then reached the 1947 Scottish Cup final, defeating Hibernian 2–1 with George Hamilton, signed from Halliday's former club Queen of the South, scoring to gain the club's first major trophy. From this early success, Halliday's side reached two more Scottish Cup finals, in 1953 and 1954, though they lost both. Halliday's team were not to <b>be</b> <b>denied,</b> however, and the following season, 1954–55, Aberdeen won their first Scottish League title. Though league winners, the club did not participate in the first European Cup competition—Scotland's place was awarded to Hibernian, who took part by special invitation.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, the Supreme Court held in Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer) (2002), that a {{statutory}} provision prohibiting prisoners serving {{a sentence of}} two years or more from voting unjustifiably infringed the fundamental right to vote guaranteed by section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court noted that the Government could not demonstrate how denying prisoners the vote helped the stated aims of the relevant statute; a democracy built on inclusiveness, democracy and citizen participation cannot be party to a law that disenfranchises a considerable part of the population. There was also no credible theory why prisoners should <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> {{the right to vote}} as a form of punishment, as it is arbitrary and not related to the offender's criminal act nor does it deter crime or rehabilitate criminals.|$|E
