5|$|The Quatermass Experiment (1953) and Quatermass II (1955), both {{written by}} Nigel Kneale, had been {{critical}} and popular successes for the BBC, and in early 1957 the corporation decided to commission a third serial.

In 2007, when the school combined with Bishop O'Hara of Dunmore, Pennsylvania, the new school called Holy Cross High School, was put in the AA class.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War {{there have}} been a number of {{attempts}} to curb military activity or even abolish the armed forces altogether. A notable referendum on the subject, launched by an anti-militarist group, was held on 26 November 1989. It was defeated with about two thirds of the voters against the proposal. A similar referendum, called for <b>before,</b> <b>but</b> held shortly after the 11 September attacks in the US, was defeated by over 78% of voters.|$|E
5|$|General Bell {{had been}} the manager {{of one of the}} coal mines in Cripple Creek where the strike was taking place. It wasn't any {{surprise}} to Haywood that soldiers seemed to be working {{in the interests of the}} employers; he had seen that situation <b>before.</b> <b>But</b> when the Colorado legislature acknowledged the complaints of organized labor and passed an eight hour law, the Colorado supreme court declared it unconstitutional. So the WFM took the issue to the voters, and 72 percent of the state's voters approved the referendum. But the Colorado government ignored the results of the referendum.|$|E

5|$|HMS Minotaur was {{originally}} ordered on 2 September 1861 as HMS Elephant, {{in honour of}} the ship once commanded by Nelson seventy years <b>before,</b> <b>but</b> her name was changed to Minotaur during construction. She was laid down on 12 September 1861 by the Thames Ironworks in Blackwall, London. She was launched on 12 December 1863, commissioned in April 1867 and completed on 1 June 1867. The lengthy delay in completion was due to frequent changes in design details, and experiments with her armament and with her sailing rig. The ship cost a total of £478,855.|$|E
5|$|Howe {{benefited from}} Montagu's withdrawal, {{as his own}} {{battered}} fleet passed close {{to the scene of}} this stand-off on 10 June, pushing north into the English Channel. With Villaret and Cornic fortuitously pursuing Montagu to the south, Howe was free to pass Ushant without difficulty and arrived off Plymouth on 12 June, joined soon afterwards by Montagu. Villaret had anchored with Cornic in Bertheaume Bay the day <b>before,</b> <b>but</b> Saint-André refused to allow him to enter Brest until the republican attitudes of the town's population had been assessed. On 12 June, the convoy from America finally arrived off France, having lost just one ship in passage during a storm.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Triscari {{was named}} as {{the coach of}} the Australian women's {{national}} wheelchair basketball team, commonly known as the Gliders. At the same time, Ben Ettridge was named as head of the men's team, the Rollers. Ettridge had worked for Triscari as a physical education teacher at Rockingham three years <b>before,</b> <b>but</b> had since become the coach of an Italian team. Ettridge had then become West Australian director of elite coaching and player development at Basketball Australia, thereby becoming Triscari's boss.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{aviation}} design teams worldwide started {{developing a}} new generation of all-metal, low-wing fighter aircraft. The French Dewoitine D.520 and Germany's Messerschmitt Bf 109, for example, were designed to take advantage of new techniques of monocoque construction and the availability of new high-powered, liquid-cooled, in-line aero engines. They also featured refinements such as retractable undercarriages, fully enclosed cockpits, low drag and all-metal wings (all introduced on civil airliners years <b>before</b> <b>but</b> slow to be adopted by the military, who favoured the biplane's simplicity and manoeuvrability).|$|E
5|$|Legislators found {{themselves}} in an unusual and uncomfortable situation. Nuclear weapons were terrifying, {{and the nature of}} nuclear energy was not widely understood. Because it was so new, there were no policies or precedents to guide legislators, and traditional party alignments were absent. The scientists who had developed the new technology had never been vocal <b>before,</b> <b>but</b> suddenly were now. The victorious conclusion of World War II gave the armed forces enormous prestige, but there still remained the long-standing American distrust of standing armies, and the tradition of civilian control of the military.|$|E
5|$|On 11th May, William and Mary {{formally}} {{accepted the}} Scottish throne and on 5th June, the Convention was {{converted into a}} full Parliament. William tried to avoid abolishing Episcopacy but Dundee's 1689 Highland campaign on behalf of James highlighted his reliance on Presbyterian support. He withdrew his opposition and the measures were approved by Parliament in 1690. The Glorious Revolution in Scotland resulted in a Parliament and Kirk far more independent than <b>before</b> <b>but</b> ending Episcopacy isolated {{a significant part of}} the political class. This was a major factor in political debates over the 1707 Act of Union and the Scottish Jacobite movement.|$|E

5|$|The North Koreans were {{apparently}} {{unaware of the}} 1st Battalion withdrawal, because the next morning, July 25, two North Korean battalions in a double envelopment came in behind the positions 1st Battalion held the night <b>before,</b> <b>but</b> in front of Major Gordon E. Murch's 2nd Battalion. There the North Koreans {{were caught in the}} open by the combined fire of American tanks, artillery, and mortar, and the 2nd Battalion's automatic and small arms fire. The North Koreans suffered large numbers of casualties in this attack. Surviving remnants of the two North Koreans battalions withdrew in confusion. The 2nd Battalion took about 30 prisoners.|$|E

Since this material was complex and layered, most numbers featuring pre-recorded or offstage percussion, keyboard, or guitar elements underlying the U2 members' live instrumentals and vocals. The band had used backing tracks in live performance <b>before,</b> <b>but</b> with the need to sync live performance to Zoo TV's high-tech visuals, almost the entire show was synced and sequenced.

5|$|While {{investigating}} the animal control team deaths, Charlie is {{attacked by the}} creature, but it fails to kill him after Olivia arrives on the scene. Walter explains he believes the creature is a man-made chimera, which has the best genetic traits of many different creatures, including a lizard, bat, and wasp. He had tried to create the creature years <b>before,</b> <b>but</b> his experiments failed, and concludes that someone else must have taken up his research. Though initially thinking Charlie was healthy after the attack, they realize the chimera's stinger injected him with its larvae, {{and that he has}} less than 24 hours to live.|$|E
5|$|A. Newton {{requested}} further specimens, especially males, but in 1875 {{he finally}} published {{a plate of}} the female, lamenting that no male specimens could be found. Tafforet's 1726 account had been rediscovered the previous year, and A. Newton noted that it confirmed his assumption that the male would turn out be much more colourful than the female. Newton's collector, Henry H. Slater, had seen a live Newton's parakeet the year <b>before,</b> <b>but</b> was not carrying a gun at the time. On 14 August 1875, William Vandorous shot a male specimen. It {{may have been the}} same specimen Slater had observed. It was subsequently sent to E. Newton by William J. Caldwell. This is the paratype of the species, numbered UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/2 and housed in the Cambridge Museum.|$|E
