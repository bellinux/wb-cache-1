5|$|It {{has already}} proven {{difficult}} {{to be recognized as}} having standing when a fix is not used for a controversial appointment. The courts have dismissed suits contesting the appointments of Justice Hugo Black (Ex parte Levitt, 302 U.S. 633 (1937)) and Judge Abner Mikva (McClure v. Carter, 454 U.S. 1025 (1981)). Black and Mikva were members of Congress (<b>Black</b> <b>of</b> the Senate, Mikva of the House of Representatives) prior to appointment were appointed without a Saxbe fix. In both cases, the courts held that the plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the appointment. Other than these cases, most attempts to gain standing have been considered frivolous lawsuits brought by fringe groups.|$|E
5|$|Victoria settled an annuity on Louise {{shortly before}} her marriage. The {{ceremony}} {{was conducted at}} St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on 21 March 1871, and the crowd outside was so large that, for the first time, policemen had to form chain barriers to keep control. Louise wore a wedding veil of Honiton lace that she designed herself, and was escorted into the Chapel by her mother, and her two eldest brothers, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh. On this occasion, the usually severe <b>black</b> <b>of</b> the Queen's mourning dress was relieved by the crimson rubies and blues of the Garter star. Following the ceremony, the Queen kissed Louise, and Lorne – {{now a member of}} the royal family, but still a subject – kissed the Queen's hand.|$|E

40|$|Before {{the dawn}} of {{democracy}} in South Africa, in the methodological debates that were associated with who the interlocutor <b>of</b> <b>Black</b> Theology <b>of</b> liberation was, there was a tacit understanding that not everyone who is black is necessarily an interlocutor <b>of</b> <b>Black</b> Theology <b>of</b> liberation. The changes arising from globalisation which coincided with the demise of apartheid seem to have diffused the clarity of interlocution in the <b>Black</b> Theology <b>of</b> liberation school as it was sought before. Another problem is that post 1994 more emphasis has been rather {{on the notion of}} prophetic theology whose relationship with the liberation paradigm is becoming equally unclear. This article will trace the debate on the interlocution and highlights the differences between prophetic theology and <b>Black</b> Theology <b>of</b> liberation in order to assert the interlocution <b>of</b> <b>Black</b> Theology <b>of</b> liberation with the voiceless in the 21 st century.
