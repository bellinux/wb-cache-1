50|$|At the Brazilian Grand Prix, Alonso {{qualified}} in nineteenth position, {{ahead of}} Jenson Button and Gastón Mazzacane, with Marques {{starting at the}} rear of the field in twenty-second. During the race, Marques achieved the best result for the PS01 with ninth place, whilst Alonso retired after completing twenty-six laps with an issue with his throttle potentiometer which affected his engine's behaviour. At the San Marino round, Alonso started in eighteenth, ahead of both Benetton cars and Mazzacane, whilst Marques qualified twenty-second for the second consecutive Grand Prix. In the race, Alonso crashed out heavily on the sixth lap which was caused by a leaking <b>brake</b> <b>calliper</b> and Marques retired on the race's fifty-fourth lap with an fuel line problem. At the Spanish Grand Prix Alonso outqualified Marques by one and a half seconds after alternations were made to Alonso's car; the drivers started from eighteenth and twenty-second on the grid and were sandwiched by the Benetton drivers and Jaguar's Pedro de la Rosa. Alonso ran strongly in the race and finished in thirteenth position and Marques took sixteenth despite struggling with handling problems throughout. Two weeks later in the Austrian Grand Prix Alonso clinched his third consecutive eighteenth position in qualifying whilst Marques set the twenty-second fastest time and was separated by both Benetton cars and Jean Alesi in a Prost. Alonso and Marques ran in the midfield early in the race but both drivers retired after forty laps because of gearbox issues.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{material}} selection and design selection of high performance floating <b>brake</b> <b>calliper.</b> The main function of brake {{system is to}} decelerate or stop a car. Disc brake system consist of brake rotor, brake pads and <b>brake</b> <b>calliper.</b> Most of the commercial vehicles use <b>brake</b> <b>calliper</b> made of Gray cast iron which possess heavy weight results in high fuel consumption. Another major problem is calliper being deflection during clamping action, known as “bending of bridge” will results in extended pedal travel since additional braking fluid volume is required to compensate for deflections, reduce comfort, driving feelings and safety of vehicle. The demand of Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) is greatly increased in automotive industry since it having a lower density, higher strength and comparable modulus of elasticity as compared to Gray cast iron. The objective of this thesis is to study the advantages of Magnesium hybrid MMC to replace conventional <b>brake</b> <b>calliper</b> and proposed few innovative design alternatives for automotive industry. This is done by creating an original <b>brake</b> <b>calliper</b> and validate for appropriate material using Finite Element Analysis (FEA), followed by select optimum design. In design selection, Quality Function Deployment (QFD) approach was used to rank the design parameters, few alternative designs were created using CatiaV 5 R 17 and analyzed for static structural analysis using FEA. In the end, best floating <b>brake</b> <b>calliper</b> design among those alternative designs was selected using Super Decision software. For further research, these fresh designs could be act as benchmark for further developed and tested for automotive applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{sugar cane}} {{industry}} uses brake vans, coupled {{to the end}} of cane trains, to produce a given constant braking force to improve the cane bin ride dynamics and to assist the braking of trains. Unlike other railway vehicles, cane bins often have neither brakes or suspensions. Currently brake vans operate using compressed air, supplied by an on board compressor, which activates a <b>brake</b> <b>calliper,</b> which clamps a ventilated disc rotor on each of the four wheel sets. This system needs maintenance due to wear on the brake pads and rotors. An electrical braking implemented using self-excited induction generator is proposed. With the application of electrical braking energy is dissipated is in well ventilated resistors. Maintenance is further reduced by a brushless design. 1...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce costs and {{increase}} {{the quality of a}} coating, it is intended to integrate the plating process into the production line. Fast plating processes are required for this task. The time for the plating process must be adjusted to the production process. Nowadays, however, plating times of up to one hour are required. Therefore, the plating process must be accelerated substantially. This work study elaborates on the process limits for a selection of zinc processes. The influences of the electrolyte parameters (zinc-, salt-, acid concentration, temperature and pH value) as well as the hydrodynamic conditions were determined with different plating cells. Within these experiments, it was possible to vary the process limits, as well as the throwing power of the electrolytes. This data can be transferred to real components. The <b>brake</b> <b>calliper</b> and the common rail were selected as a characteristic example, because Robert Bosch GmbH required an integration of the surface processes into the production line. The numerical simulations of the potential field and the current density distribution (ElSy 2 D and PlatingMaster) at the component surface were carried out. Combining these current density simulations with the hydrodynamic ones (Fluent) the coating result can be predicted. In this way, it was possible to reduce the plating time for both the <b>brake</b> <b>calliper</b> and the common rail by more than eight-fold compared to the conventional process. These methods can be also transferred to other geometrically complicated components. The application of these methods {{is not limited to the}} high speed zinc process. These can be also used for the fast plating of other metals. In certain cases it could be lengthy procedure to find a good plating process. In order to find easily a plating process for a component with any geometry a so-called "decision matrix" was developed. This shows a way to find the appropriate plating process, with regards to coating requirements, by a systematic method. The electrolyte characterisation, the numerical simulation of the potential fields and the hydrodynamic conditions are the most important tools. The practical applicability of this decision matrix is shown through examples on selected components...|$|E
40|$|The {{process which}} {{converts}} the kinetic {{energy of the}} vehicle into mechanical energy is known as Braking, which must be dissipated {{in the form of}} heat. The device using for decelerating or stopping the rotation of a wheel is called as disc brake. A brake disc (or rotor) usually made of linear shaped slots between plates and a disc brake (or rotor) usually made of curved shaped slots between plates having materials used in both is Structural Steel, is connected to the wheel and/or the axle. Friction material in the form of brake pads (mounted on a device called a <b>brake</b> <b>calliper)</b> is forced mechanically, hydraulically, pneumatically or electromagnetically against both sides of the disc to stop the wheel. The present thesis topic is generally deals with the improved analysis on Structural Analysis on two different models one have linear slots and other have curved slots between the two plates of disc brakes, using of ventilated disc brake using CATIA v 5 R 20 and ANSYS 15. 0. 7 we found that ventilated disc having curve slot have less development of strain and stress in comparision of ventilated disc having linear slot on same parameter. In this research Coupled Analysis (of both different shaped slots) is performed in order to find the strength of the disc brake. In structural analysis displacement, ultimate stress limit for the design is found as an important factor...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that {{the coefficient of}} friction between the friction pair, the pad and the rotor {{plays a significant role}} in the propensity of a brake to generate noise. Because of the ease with which changes may be made to the pad compound material it is this that is more often the subject of change when there is a problematic noisy brake with both the rotor and the calliper tending to remain 'isolated' from examination. This paper investigates the propensity of a brake to generate noise over a range of temperatures and pressures under conditions that allow a mechanically induced offset centre of pressure between the pad and rotor to be varied. It is shown that for a high-volume production car brake there is an increased tendency for it to generate noise when a very specific leading offset centre of pressure is engineered. With this condition it is shown that a situation is promoted whereby the brake becomes mechanically unstable, with system changes such as brake pressure and temperature variations having little influence on the brake to alter its tendency to generate noise. Furthermore, it is shown that the critical offset centre of pressure may be related to the coefficient of friction between the friction pair and the mounting geometry of the calliper. Confirmation of the findings are supported by a repeat investigation of the vehicle's alternative <b>brake</b> <b>calliper.</b> It is suggested that the source of a noisy brake may lie as much in basic mechanical design as inappropriate material choice. Further confirmation is demonstrated through the study of a commercial sliding fist-type brake, where the brake is significantly noisier when the centre of pressure and calliper mounting arrangement provide an appropriate spragging angle related to the friction coefficient...|$|E

40|$|Europe's braking {{technology}} conference & exhibition EuroBrake 2014, LILLE, FRANCE, 13 -/ 05 / 2014 - 15 / 05 / 2014 The goal of {{this research}} is to explore the relations between the disc brake noise and the design of the pad from an experimental and a numerical point of view. Transient and stability analysis have been conducted on large industrial models with the numerical tool developed in the 'Acoufren' french project. This tool allows introducing simplified 3 D Finite Elements (FE) pad models built from 2 D drawings. The objective is to conclude on the ability of the tool to distinguish brake vibration/noise from different specific pad. The method to reach the objective is to conduct both experimental campaign and numerical study on a set of 3 existing pads. For each of the pads, squeal measurements (noise and vibration) are conducted on a test bench for several configurations (velocities, pressures, direction of rotation). For the numerical study, both stability and transient simulation are conducted on an assembled brake model. This global brake model is not updated but the FE models of each component of the <b>brake</b> (<b>calliper,</b> disc) are updated from experimental modal analysis. The 'Acoufren' tool allows to import a simplified pad model (built from 2 D drawings) which complete the global brake model. A specific method has been developed here to update the simplified pad model according to specific measurements. The final step is the comparison between measurements and numerical results for the 3 kind of pads. Relations between experimental noise/vibration of the brake and mechanical parameters of the pads have been found. The simplified pad FE model is updated in 2 phases: measurements of the elastic moduli / damping of friction material and measurements of the modal parameters of the first modes of the pad in free conditions and/or clamped on a marble (depending of the mechanical architecture of the pad). A good agreement can be found on some pads between numerical results and experimental results. The study is limited here to one brake type only (but with variability of pad). A strategy has been proposed to explore the relations between the disc brake noise and the design of the pad. With the numerical tool developed in the 'Acoufren' french project, a good agreement has been found on some pads between numerical results and experimental results. This result is a new step in the prediction of noise/vibration railway disc brakes related to pads...|$|E
