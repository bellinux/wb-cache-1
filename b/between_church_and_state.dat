5|$|Historians {{debate the}} extent to which Geneva was a theocracy. On the one hand, Calvin's {{theology}} clearly called for separation <b>between</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state.</b> Other historians have stressed the enormous political power wielded on a daily basis by the clerics.|$|E

Board of Education (1947), which held that the establishment clause was applicable not only to the federal government, but also to the states.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{led to the}} {{development}} of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection <b>between</b> <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> <b>State,</b> a legacy of Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others.|$|E

This study would defend an affirmative attitude to the shape of the property settlement <b>between</b> <b>churches</b> <b>and</b> the <b>state</b> with the aid of the appropriate literature and resources.

5|$|Cẩn was {{considered}} the most secular of the four Ngô brothers who controlled Vietnam's domestic affairs. With the appointment of elder brother Thục as the Archbishop of Huế in 1961, Cẩn became less influential as Thục aggressively blurred the distinction <b>between</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state.</b> In early 1963, Nhu sent an emissary from Saigon telling Cẩn to retire and leave for Japan. Unrest erupted {{in the summer of}} 1963. After the flying of Vatican flags was permitted at a celebration for the anniversary of Thục's consecration as a bishop, the flying of Buddhist flags on 8 May to commemorate Vesak — the birth of Gautama Buddha — was banned. Cẩn's subordinates ordered government forces to fire on the unarmed Buddhist crowd protesting the ban, killing nine. Cẩn believed the United States, whose relations with South Vietnam had become strained, caused an explosion during the Vesak shootings, to destabilise his family's regime.|$|E
5|$|Europe was {{immersed}} in power struggles on many different fronts. The Christian Church split along Latin Orthodox lines in 1054 after centuries of disagreement {{leading to a}} permanent division called the East–West Schism. Following the Gregorian Reform, an assertive, reformist papacy attempted to increase its power and influence over the laity. Beginning around 1075 and continuing during the First Crusade, the Investiture Controversy was a power struggle <b>between</b> <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> in medieval Europe over whether the Catholic Church or the Holy Roman Empire held the right to appoint church officials and other clerics. Antipope Clement III was an alternative pope {{for most of this}} period, and Pope Urban spent much of his early pontificate in exile from Rome. The result was intense piety and an increased interest in religious affairs amongst the general population in Catholic Europe and religious propaganda by the Papacy advocating a just war to reclaim Palestine from the Muslims. Participation in a crusade was seen as a form of penance that could counterbalance sin.|$|E
5|$|Like the old revolutionary States-General, the new National Assembly {{contained}} radically opposed parties: the unitary democrats, led by Pieter Vreede, Johan Valckenaer and Pieter Paulus, and the federalists, such as Jacob Abraham de Mist and Gerard Willem van Marle. But {{there was}} a broad continuum of opinion between these poles. In this force-field the federalists held the upper hand after the sudden demise of Paulus (who might otherwise have acted as a unifier). The conservative federalists were more adept at parliamentary manoeuvering (Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck proved himself especially adept at this). The frustration this engendered among the democrats led them to appeal to popular opinion and to extra-parliamentary action. Meanwhile, the Assembly installed a constitutional commission that in November 1796 presented a report that amounted to {{a continuation of the}} old federal arrangements. As this was totally unacceptable to the unitarists, this draft was subsequently amended into its opposite, by a compromise that finally formed a basis for a new Constitution. The Assembly now started upon a discussion of other important matters, like the separation <b>between</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state,</b> and the emancipation of minorities. The organs of the state were to be a bicameral Legislative Corps, to be elected in indirect elections, and a Directoire-like Executive of five members. The end result looked much like the French Constitution of 1795. This was approved by the Assembly on 10 May 1797.|$|E

5|$|The Treaty of Union {{that led}} to the {{formation}} of the Kingdom of Great Britain ensured that there would be a Protestant succession as well as a link <b>between</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> that still remains. The Church of England (Anglican) is legally recognised as the established church, and so retains representation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom through the Lords Spiritual, whilst the British monarch is a member of the church as well as its Supreme Governor. The Church of England also retains the right to draft legislative measures (related to religious administration) through the General Synod that can then be passed into law by Parliament. The Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales is the second largest Christian church with around five million members, mainly in England. There are also growing Orthodox, Evangelical and Pentecostal churches, with Pentecostal churches in England now third after the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church in terms of church attendance. Other large Christian groups include Methodists and Baptists.|$|E
5|$|The {{relation}} {{of church and}} state in Zwingli's mind is best represented in a statue by the Wasserkirche, where he stands with a Bible {{in one hand and a}} sword in the other. For him, the church and state are one under the sovereign rule of God. The development of the complex relationship <b>between</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> in Zwingli's view can only be understood by examining the context of his life, the city of Zürich, and the wider Swiss Confederation. His earliest writings before he became a reformer, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), reveal a patriotic love of his land, a longing for liberty, and opposition to the mercenary service where young Swiss citizens were sent to fight in foreign wars for the financial benefit of the state government. His life as a parish priest and an army chaplain helped to develop his concern for morality and justice. He saw his ministry not limited to a private sphere, but to the people as a whole.|$|E

25|$|Alan Dershowitz {{and others}} have {{suggested}} reserving the word marriage for religious contexts as part of privatizing marriage, and in civil and legal contexts using a uniform concept of civil unions, in part to strengthen the separation <b>between</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state.</b> Jennifer Roback Morse, {{the president of the}} anti-same-sex marriage group National Organization for Marriage's Ruth Institute project, claims that the conflation of marriage with contractual agreements is a threat to marriage.|$|E
25|$|Iconodules further {{argued that}} {{decisions}} {{such as whether}} icons ought to be venerated were properly made by the church assembled in council, not imposed on the church by an emperor. Thus the argument also involved {{the issue of the}} proper relationship <b>between</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state.</b> Related to this was the observation that it was foolish to deny to God the same honor that was freely given to the human emperor, since portraits of the emperor were common and the iconoclasts did not oppose them.|$|E
25|$|Elections for 31 {{delegates to}} a Constituent Assembly were held on 15 September 1900 {{with the same}} balloting restrictions. In all three elections, pro-independence candidates, {{including}} {{a large number of}} mambi delegates, won overwhelming majorities. The Constitution was drawn up from November 1900 to February 1901 and then passed by the Assembly. It established a republican form of government, proclaimed internationally recognized individual rights and liberties, freedom of religion, separation <b>between</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state,</b> and described the composition, structure and functions of state powers.|$|E

40|$|The author {{discusses}} {{historical development}} of the relation <b>between</b> the <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> the <b>State</b> in Great Britain from the separation from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534 to contemporary changes. In accordance with the premises of historical institutionalism, the paper tries to identify milestones in the relation <b>between</b> the <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> the <b>State</b> which have decisively shaped {{the creation of the}} contemporary British model of the relation between the two. Since the British model has often been simplified to the model of the “State Church” in different overviews of the relation <b>between</b> the <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> the <b>State</b> in Europe, the paper aims to present some of the key characteristics of regulation of the Church-State relation and social changes which result in modifications to the ideal type of the “State Church”. In this respect, it is noteworthy to examine the debate on the multicultural society in Great Britain, as well as possibilities and limitations of the numerous theories of multiculturalism. Bearing in mind the fact that the British model of the relation <b>between</b> the <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> the <b>State</b> stands representative for similar models found in other Scandinavian countries, the application of this research can be extended to the European level in the process of finding a common approach to the dialogue with different <b>Churches,</b> religious communities <b>and</b> communities of atheistic and agnostic beliefs...|$|R

25|$|The {{council was}} {{to act as}} a {{legislative}} body in the Kingdom of God, and in Utah, the Council became a provisional legislative body in the government. This continued until September 1850 when Congress organized the Utah Territory upon petition by the church. After Utah became a territory, the American expectation for a separation <b>between</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> sharply diminished the Council's official role in government. The Council then suspended meetings in October 1851. The council met again only briefly in 1867 and 1868 and voted for the establishment of Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI).|$|E
25|$|There is no {{official}} state church in Switzerland; however, all the 26 cantons (states) financially support {{at least one}} of the three traditional denominations—Roman Catholic, Old Catholic, or Protestant—with funds collected through taxation. Each canton has its own regulations regarding the relationship <b>between</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state.</b> In some cantons, the church tax (up to 2.3%) is voluntary but in others an individual who chooses not to contribute to church tax may formally have to leave the church. In some cantons private companies are unable to avoid payment of the church tax.|$|E

25|$|As already explained, {{the first}} two Neoclassical periods were almost {{completely}} devoted {{to the construction of}} secular buildings.

Ghenadie earned support from the opposition Conservatives, and was energetically defended in print by poet Alexandru Macedonski. His decision to contest the Synod resulted in his banishment to Căldărușani Monastery, as a simple monk. Large swathes of the public rallied behind him, causing protests and riots against the Sturdza government.|$|E
