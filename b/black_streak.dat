[...] During each cyclothem, the land was flooded, allowing the accumulation of marine deposits such as shale, limestone and sandstone.

60|$|A citizen told me {{a curious}} thing about those mines. With all my {{experience}} of mining I {{had never heard of}} anything of the sort before. The main gold reef runs about north and south--of course--for that is the custom of a rich gold reef. At Ballarat its course is between walls of slate. Now the citizen told me that throughout a stretch of twelve miles along the reef, the reef is crossed at intervals by a straight <b>black</b> <b>streak</b> of a carbonaceous nature--a streak in the slate; a streak no thicker than a pencil--and that wherever it crosses the reef you will certainly find gold at the junction. It is called the Indicator. Thirty feet {{on each side of the}} Indicator (and down in the slate, of course) is a still finer streak--a streak as fine as a pencil mark; and indeed, that is its name Pencil Mark. Whenever you find the Pencil Mark you know that thirty feet from it is the Indicator; you measure the distance, excavate, find the Indicator, trace it straight to the reef, and sink your shaft; your fortune is made, for certain. If that is true, it is curious. And it is curious anyway.|$|E
