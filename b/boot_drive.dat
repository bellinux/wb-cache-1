40|$|The NEXIO Volt ™ {{baseband}} {{video server}} answers {{the call for}} improved space savings and lower operating costs while maintaining {{the highest levels of}} resilience and reliability. A new addition to the NEXIO ® product family, NEXIO Volt offers support for up to four mixed HD/SD or SD-only baseband channels in a 1 RU package. Built on the same platform as the award-winning NEXIO AMP ® advanced media platform, NEXIO Volt is designed for use with NEXIO true shared storage, a modular and scalable system that makes it easy to add channels and storage as a broadcaster’s requirements change. Multiple NEXIO Volt servers can be attached to a NEXIO shared storage system, enabling systems with hundreds of channels and integration with other NEXIO baseband servers, editors and gateways. Environmental considerations are {{an essential part of the}} NEXIO Volt design. New high-performance, low-power processors reduce power consumption. Available solid-state <b>boot</b> <b>drives</b> offer additional energy efficiency — and extend system duty cycle. A strong industrial design concept enhances structural integrity and reduces weight, while reducing materials and coatings used in manufacturing. Features • Up to 4 HD/SD or SD-only channels in a 1 RU platform • Ingest and playback of HD (1080 i, 720 p) and SD (525 i/ 625 i) content on the same chassis • Direct access to the NEXIO shared storage • Fault tolerance through dual hot-swappable power supplies, dual mirrored <b>boot</b> <b>drives</b> and RAIDsoft ™ software RAID management syste...|$|R

We describe the architecture and implementation of M 2 and compare its agility, scalability, and performance to existing systems.

50|$|Some late {{versions}} of the DR-DOS IBMBIO.COM provide a pre-boot config structure, holding bit flags to select (beside others) between various drive letter assignment strategies. These strategies can be pre-selected by a user or OEM or be changed by a boot loader on the fly when launching DR-DOS. Under these issues, the <b>boot</b> <b>drive</b> can be different from A: or C: as well.|$|E
50|$|Initially the HP250 {{was like}} the HP300 as a single user, floppy based {{computer}} system.

This gave some business-growth scale-ability to the HP250 product line.|$|E
50|$|In Windows NT, {{the boot}} loader is called NTLDR. It is {{responsible}} for accessing the file system on the <b>boot</b> <b>drive,</b> for starting ntoskrnl.exe and for loading boot-time device drivers into memory.

50|$|Traditionally, values {{other than}} 00hex (not active) and 80hex (active) were invalid and the {{bootstrap}} program would display an error message upon encountering them. However, the Plug and Play BIOS Specification and BIOS Boot Specification (BBS) allowed other devices to become bootable as well since 1994. Consequently, {{with the introduction}} of MS-DOS 7.10 (Windows 95B) and higher, the MBR started to treat a set bit 7 as active flag and showed an error message for values 01hex..7Fhex only. It continued to treat the entry as physical drive unit to be used when loading the corresponding partition's VBR later on, thereby now also accepting other <b>boot</b> <b>drives</b> than 80hex as valid, however, MS-DOS did not make use of this extension by itself. Storing the actual physical drive number in the partition table does not normally cause backward compatibility problems, since the value will differ from 80hex only on drives other than the first one (which have not been bootable before, anyway). However, even with systems enabled to <b>boot</b> off other <b>drives,</b> the extension may still not work universally, for example, after the BIOS assignment of physical drives has changed, for example when drives are removed, added or swapped. Therefore, per the BIOS Boot Specification (BBS), it is best practice for a modern MBR accepting bit 7 as active flag to pass on the DL value originally provided by the BIOS instead of using the entry in the partition table.|$|R

5000|$|Because some minimal {{hardware}} {{support is}} involved, this implementation approach is also called [...] "hardware-assisted software RAID", [...] "hybrid model" [...] RAID, or even [...] "fake RAID".

40|$|Alpine {{skiing is}} the most popular winter sport in the world. For nearly 40 years, {{progress}} in quality ski equip-ment and considerable improvement of ski boots and bind-ing systems contributed to the reduction of many injuries (50 % less since 1972). 3 Leg and ankle injuries particularly decreased, 2 but serious knee ligament sprains have risen dramatically. 4, 24 Ten percent of all the accidents in snow skiing involve an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, 18 which is twice more than in 1970. 6 Forty-five per-cent to 60 % of knee injuries during alpine skiing involve an ACL injury. 6, 18 Various mechanisms could cause an ACL injury during skiing. 27 The boot-induced anterior drawer mechanism during hard landings after a jump is common among high-level alpine skiers. 24 When the top of the ski <b>boot</b> <b>drives</b> the tibia forward, the skier assumes a characteristic seated position. This produces an anterior-directed force on the tibia relative to the femur, which is incompletely controlled by a massive quadriceps contraction. 19 This mechanism of ACL injury in elite alpine skiers is distinct from that of the recreational skier, which typically involves a combined val-gus and internal rotation tibial force...|$|R

50|$|In {{hardware}} virtualization, virtual machines implement virtual drives as part {{of their}} efforts to emulate the behavior of an actual machine.

50|$|If a <b>boot</b> <b>drive</b> fails, {{the system}} has to be {{sophisticated}} {{enough to be able}} to boot off the remaining drive or drives. For instance, consider a computer whose disk is configured as RAID 1 (mirrored drives); if the first drive in the array fails, then a first-stage boot loader might not be sophisticated enough to attempt loading the second-stage boot loader from the second drive as a fallback. The second-stage boot loader for FreeBSD is capable of loading a kernel from such an array.|$|E
