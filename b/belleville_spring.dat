40|$|Harvesting kinetic ambient energy usually {{involves}} {{the development of}} converters which operate in the low frequency range (from 0 to 100 Hz). A limit of the harvesters proposed in the literature is their relatively high operating frequency. This work deals {{with the development of}} a very low frequency energy harvester based on two counteracting <b>Belleville</b> <b>springs.</b> For a given height to thickness ratio, <b>Belleville</b> <b>springs</b> have nearly zero stiffness over a wide deflection range, thus giving the possibility to build a low frequency system.

40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Multisetting Torque Limiter {{will be used}} by astronauts {{during the}} First Servicing Mission STS- 61. It was {{designed}} to replace several individual torque limiters. This replacement reduces the number of tools required as well as reduce the time required for servicing. The Multisetting Torque Limiter design specified five separate torque settings: 2, 5. 3, 9, 35 and 45 ft-lbs. This original units were tested at the 2, 5. 3, and 9 ft-lbs settings and {{did not meet the}} design specifications. The 35 ft-lb and 45 ft-lb torque settings were not incorporated into the original flight design. The objective of the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) redesign effort is to incorporate all five torque settings into a flight design which means the requirements for the first HST Servicing Mission. The first target of the redesign effort focused on the spring chamber and ball detent design. The original design used <b>belleville</b> <b>springs</b> in parallel; the new design changed this configuration to <b>belleville</b> <b>springs</b> stacked in series. The current engineering unit was successfully tested in ambient environment at all five settings.

40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} from kinetic ambient {{energy is}} particularly effective to power autonomous sensors. This work proposes an innovative energy converter {{based on two}} counteracting <b>Belleville</b> <b>springs</b> and exploiting their peculiarity, for a height to thickness ratio equal to 1. 414, of nearly zero stiffness over a wide deflection range. After analytical and numerical modelling a prototype is developed and experimentally investigated. The sub-optimal geometry of the commercial springs used in the prototype, together with a non-ideal response, makes the operating frequency for the prototype higher than in analytical and numerical predictions. Nevertheless, the harvester exhibits a significantly large bandwidth, together with a high output power, compared to similar solutions in the literature, for all the examined configurations and input excitations...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} from kinetic ambient energy requires converters able to efficiently {{operate in}} the low frequency range. A limit of the solutions proposed in the literature, both electromagnetic and piezoelectric, is their operating frequency, which generally ranges from about 50 to 300 Hz. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes an innovative energy harvester exploiting two counteracting <b>Belleville</b> <b>springs.</b> Thanks to the peculiar height to thickness ratio of the springs a highly compliant elastic system is obtained, {{which can be used}} either for electromagnetic or piezoelectric harvesting. The harvester is modelled analytically and numerically both with regard to the force-displacement and to the modal response. The experimental validation of the harvester, highlights a noticeable power output but at a higher eigenfrequency than expected...|$|R
50|$|In {{the army}} industry, Belleville springs are used, for instance, {{in a number}} of landmines e.g. the American M19, M15, M14, M1 and the Swedish Tret-Mi.59. The target (a person or vehicle) exerts {{pressure}} on the <b>belleville</b> <b>spring,</b> causing it to exceed a trigger threshold and flip the adjacent firing pin downwards into a stab detonator, firing both it and the surrounding booster charge and main explosive filling.|$|E
50|$|Note: {{magnetic}} influence fuzes give full-width attack i.e. {{any part}} of the target vehicle passing over the mine will trigger detonation, not just the track or wheels. However, since magnetic fuzes are electronic, their operational life relies on battery power. Ultimately the battery will run down, after which the mine no longer functions. In contrast, a purely mechanical fuze (usually triggered via a <b>belleville</b> <b>spring)</b> gives a much longer operational life e.g. mines planted 50 years previously will still detonate if a target vehicle drives over them.|$|E
50|$|The M14 mine {{is a small}} (56 mm diameter) anti-personnel {{land mine}} first {{deployed}} by the U.S. circa 1955. The M14 mechanism uses a <b>belleville</b> <b>spring</b> to flip a firing pin downwards into a stab detonator when pressure is applied. Once deployed, the M14 {{is very difficult to}} detect because it is a minimum metal mine, i.e. most of its components are plastic. Because of this, the design was later modified to ease mine clearance via the addition of a steel washer, glued onto the base of the mine.|$|E

Special attention is given to the issue of single tool change systems using storage tool magazines. Considering the following construction theme of the thesis, most commonly used spindle clamping units were described. With use of the gathered information was then created the construction draft of the ATC system suitable to be used with a numerically controled milling machine. Solution of the issue consists of the static structural analysis of the clamping unit using the finite element method and design of the <b>belleville</b> <b>springs</b> set. Final output of the draft comprises of drawing documentation of the main parts of the system...|$|R

40|$|Springs have {{a complex}} geometry. In operation, large elastic {{deformations}} occur. Contacts within the spring, e. g. contacts of coils, and contacts to bordering components {{have to be}} taken into account. They all lead to great nonlinearities. Further difficulties are caused by spring natural oscillations in dynamic operations such as higher stress levels, friction, noises as well as lateral movements. The experimental analysis of springs is time-consuming. Therefore numerical simulation programs have been used more and more often. These programs are only usable by calculation engineers, specialy trained in the utilized numeric method and in spring technology. Therefore, with the FEM-spring-processor (FEM=Finite-Element-Method) and the MBS-spring-processor (MBS=Multi-Body Systems) two powerful object-oriented programs were developed, both usable without special knowledge of the numeric methods, with an easy-to-use graphical user-interface. The FEM-spring-processor includes modules for different helical <b>springs,</b> torsion <b>springs,</b> <b>Belleville</b> <b>springs</b> and a feature based branch for easy modelling of complex shaped springs made of wire or strip. Nonlinearities can be computed, results are load curves, stresses and natural frequencies. For the analysis of highly dynamic applications, the additional use of MBS is advised. The MBS-spring-processor includes models for helical compression springs. The paper describes the programs and examples of use...|$|R
5000|$|The No 7 Mk 1 Dingbat mine is a British anti-personnel blast mine. The mine has a steel body, with a {{flexible}} pressure pad {{on the top}} surface. Under the pressure pad is a <b>belleville</b> <b>spring</b> with a central striker. The fuse is slid {{into the side of}} the mine, a firing pin prevents the fuse being fully inserted until it is removed. The mine was intended to be scattered mechanically, and a number of systems were tested to scatter it. However, none were accepted into service, so the Dingbat mine was hand laid instead. The mine came with a small fabric cover to help hide it.|$|E
50|$|The M6, M6A1 and M6A2 are {{a series}} of metal-cased, {{circular}} anti-tank landmines produced by the United States; they were superseded in service by the larger M15 mine. The mine is normally painted olive green and has a large central pressure plate. In the centre of the pressure plate is an arming plug that has an arming lever with three settings: ARMED, DANGER and SAFE. The pressure plate rests on a concertina-like structure, which when enough force is applied is compressed. Compression results in a transfer plate under the arming plug pressing downwards onto a <b>belleville</b> <b>spring</b> which inverts, flipping the firing pin into the detonator, which triggers the adjacent explosive booster and main explosive charge.|$|E
5000|$|The {{plastic casing}} {{of the mine}} is usually dark olive green, and has a large central fuze well. Normally it has a {{carrying}} handle on one side. The mine is normally fitted with the M606 fuze which has an arming switch with two settings, S(afe) and A(rmed). These markings are either painted in yellow or embossed into the plastic. When the switch is set to [...] "A" [...] and the safety clip is removed, the mine will detonate if a vehicle drives over it. The firing mechanism is triggered by a <b>belleville</b> <b>spring</b> which flips the firing pin downwards into the stab detonator, setting off the adjacent booster charge and main explosive filling.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental study}} on rockbursts {{that occur in}} deep underground excavations. To begin with, the boundary conditions for excavation in deep underground engineering were analysed and elastic adaptive boundary is {{an effective way to}} minimize the boundary effect of geomechanical model test. Then, in order to simulate an elastic adaptive loading boundary, <b>Belleville</b> <b>springs</b> were used to establish this loading boundary. With the aforementioned experimental set-ups and fabrication of similarity models for test, the phenomena of strain mode rockbursts were satisfactorily reproduced in laboratory. The internal stress, strain, and convergences of the openings of the model were instrumented by subtly preembedded sensors and transducers. Test results showed that, with an initial state of high stress from both upper layers’ gravitational effects and in situ stress due to tectonic movements, the excavation brings a dramatic rise in the hoop stress and sharp drop in radial stress, which leads to the splitting failure of rock mass. Finally a rockburst occurred associated with the release of strain energy stored in highly stressed rock mass. In addition, the failure of the surrounding rock demonstrated an obvious hysteresis effect which supplies valuable guide and reference for tunnel support. Not only do these results provide a basis for further comprehensive experiments, but also the data can offer assisting aids for further theoretical study of rockbursts...|$|R
40|$|The "Live Loading " of valve packing {{has been}} the topic of many {{articles}} and papers {{over the past few}} years. It has been highly recommended by some, and claimed to have no value by others. The truth is both statements can be correct. It all depends on the individual application. The problem is determining if a valve is a candidate for "Live Loading". In most cases this can be decided by answering a few questions! Is it a packed valve?! Does the valve cycle frequently?! Is it motor operated?! Is the valve difficult to get at?! Is the valve subject to high temperatures & pressures?! Is the valve in a critical application?! Does the valve have a history of packing leaks?! Does the valve have to be monitored under the new EPA regulations? If the answer to the first question and any of the others is yes, there is a good possibility that the valve in question is a candidate for live loading. Many different packing materials can and have been live loaded, but since the graphite based materials are the most commonly used in live load applications, the data referred to has been based on these materials. To understand how live loading works, let's first look at how <b>belleville</b> <b>springs</b> work, what live loading is, and when live loading can be used...|$|R
50|$|A washer is a {{thin plate}} (typically disk-shaped) with a hole (typically in the middle) that is {{normally}} used to distribute the load of a threaded fastener, such as a screw or nut. Other uses are as a spacer, <b>spring</b> (<b>belleville</b> washer, wave washer), wear pad, preload indicating device, locking device, and to reduce vibration (rubber washer). Washers often have an outer diameter (OD) about twice their inner diameter (ID), but this can vary quite widely.|$|R
5000|$|The M21 is a {{circular}} U.S. anti-tank landmine {{that uses a}} Misznay Schardin effect warhead. The mine uses an M607 pressure fuse, which can be adapted as a tilt rod fuze. The mine is triggered either by pressure, or by the tilt rod being forced beyond 20 degrees from the vertical by a force of more than 1.7 kg, either of these actions results in pressure being transferred via a bearing cap to a <b>Belleville</b> <b>spring,</b> which inverts, driving the firing pin into the M46 detonator. The M46 charge first ignites a black powder charge, which blows off the mine's cover, and clears any earth or debris {{that may have been}} on top of the mine. A fraction of a second later the main warhead detonates, driving and compressing a steel plate upwards, with enough force to penetrate 76 mm of armour at a distance of 530 mm. Approximately 200,000 M21 mines were produced in the U.S. and a licensed copies, the K441 and K442, were produced in South Korea.|$|E
50|$|Though rare, a few {{land mine}} designs (both {{anti-tank}} and anti-personnel) contain no metal whatsoever. Such mines cannot be found using metal detectors {{because there is}} no metal to detect. Typically, 100% non-metallic landmines have a plastic case and a fuze which comprises a glass or plastic vial containing a mixture of friction-sensitive pyrotechnic composition and glass powder. Downward force on the pressure plate overcomes the breaking strain of a plastic shear pin which snaps, allowing the non-metallic firing pin assembly to move. The firing pin is pushed down through a flexible plastic forcing-cone, which abruptly releases it on the other side at much higher velocity. Concentrated pressure is thereby transferred directly onto the glass vial, crushing and fracturing it. Alternatively, when the shear pin breaks, pressure on the fuze is transferred onto a plastic <b>belleville</b> <b>spring</b> which flips downwards, stabbing a non-metallic tapered pin (sometimes made from a glass ceramic) through a thin plastic membrane covering the vial of friction-sensitive pyrotechnic mixture. Either way, this action causes a flash of flame that triggers the detonator and initiates the adjacent booster which in turn detonates the main explosive filling.|$|E
5000|$|The mine {{consists}} of a large, circular rounded steel case, with a central pressure plate. In {{the center of the}} pressure plate is the M4 arming plug, which has an arming lever which can be set to [...] "ARMED" [...] or [...] "SAFE". The pressure plate sits on top of a <b>belleville</b> <b>spring,</b> which in turn rests directly over the M603 fuze. When sufficient downward pressure is applied to the pressure plate (i.e. when a vehicle drives over it) the concertina spring is compressed. This action transfers pressure onto the M603 fuze which fires, triggering detonation. Because this mine has a metallic case, it is very easy to find it using even the most basic mine detector. However, a complicating factor is posed by the two secondary fuze wells. These enable anti-handling devices to be fitted: one {{on the side of the}} mine and one underneath. Additionally, a minefield containing M15 mines may also contain a number of minimum metal M19 mines, plus various antipersonnel mines of different types (e.g. the VS-MK2, SB-33, TS-50, PMA-2 or PMA-3), all of which are specifically designed to be difficult to find using metal mine detectors.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this program {{is to develop a}} system to both monitor the vibration of a bottomhole assembly, and to adjust the properties of an active damper in response to these measured vibrations. Phase I of this program, which entailed modeling and design of the necessary subsystems and design, manufacture and test of a full laboratory prototype, was completed on May 31, 2004. The principal objectives of Phase II are: more extensive laboratory testing, including the evaluation of different feedback algorithms for control of the damper; design and manufacture of a field prototype system; and, testing of the field prototype in drilling laboratories and test wells. As a result of the lower than expected performance of the MR damper noted last quarter, several additional tests were conducted. These dealt with possible causes of the lack of dynamic range observed in the testing: additional damping from the oil in the Belleville springs; changes in properties of the MR fluid; and, residual magnetization of the valve components. Of these, only the last was found to be significant. By using a laboratory demagnetization apparatus between runs, a dynamic range of 10 : 1 was achieved for the damper, more than adequate to produce the needed improvements in drilling. Additional modeling was also performed to identify a method of increasing the magnetic field in the damper. As a result of the above, several changes were made in the design. Additional circuitry was added to demagnetize the valve as the field is lowered. The valve was located to above the <b>Belleville</b> <b>springs</b> to reduce the load placed upon it and offer a greater range of materials for its construction. In addition, to further increase the field strength, the coils were relocated from the mandrel to the outer housing. At the end of the quarter, the redesign was complete and new parts were on order. The project is approximately three months behind schedule at this time...|$|R
40|$|The KDamper {{is a novel}} passive {{vibration}} isolation and damping concept, based essentially on the optimal combination of appropriate stiffness elements, which include a negative stiffness el-ement. Among others, KDamper can provide comparative advantages in the very low fre-quency range. It should be mentioned, that the KDamping concept does not simply refer to a discrete vibration absorption device, but it consists a general vibration ab-sorption concept, applicable also {{for the design of}} advanced materials or complex structures. Such a concept thus presents the potential for numerous implementations in a large variety of technological applications, while further potential may emerge in a multi- physics environment. The paper proceeds to a review of the optimal design and selection of the parameters of the KDamper, which follows exactly the classical approach used for the design of the TMD. The negative stiffness elements have been replaced with a set of <b>Belleville</b> (disc) <b>springs.</b> It should be mentioned that two different cases for an initial displacement and an initial velocity have been considered. It is thus theoretically proven that the KDamper can inherently offer far better isolation and damping properties than the TMD. Finally, an application concerning the implementation of the KDamper for the design of a low frequency vertical vibration isolator is presented. Comment: 22 pages, 16 figure...|$|R
50|$|Because {{of these}} shortcomings, the M600 {{chemical}} fuze {{was removed from}} service around 1953 and replaced by the M603 single-impulse fuze, which used a mechanical trigger mechanism i.e. a <b>belleville</b> <b>spring.</b> The M603 fuze is inherently safe to handle and much more reliable. In addition to the standard M603 fuze, two additional fuzes are available: the M624 tilt-rod fuze (which offers full-width attack capability) and the M608 double-impulse fuze. The M624 fuze requires 3.75 pounds of pressure to move the tilt rod, and once it exceeds 20 degrees of tilt the mine will detonate. The M608 double-impulse fuze will not detonate the mine when the first tank drives over it: instead, it simply arms itself so that the mine detonates when the second vehicle (e.g. an APC or perhaps a truck towing a howitzer) following in the tracks of the first tank drives over it - an event which might occur seconds, hours or even weeks later. The M608 double-impulse fuze is particularly useful when fitted to mines located on the outer edges of minefields, because this gives tanks {{a false sense of}} security. The lead tank, for instance, can drive over 30 mines fitted with double-impulse fuzes without detonating any of them. This lures tanks deep into the minefield, where they eventually trigger mines fitted with the M603 or M624 fuze (both of which operate exclusively in single-impulse mode) and become trapped. Attempts to recover the tanks or rescue victims are hindered {{by the fact that the}} M608-fitted mines previously driven over are now operating in single-impulse mode, and also because minefields containing M15 mines usually contain various antipersonnel mines as well, for instance the M14 mine and M16 bounding mine. An additional benefit of double-impulse fuzes is that they give mines a degree of protection against clearance techniques which use blast overpressure or mine roller systems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] In tractors, during {{front end}} loader, dozer, dry and wet {{puddling}} applications {{there will be}} higher frequency of operation of clutch because of increased need of quick forward and reverse transmissions.
