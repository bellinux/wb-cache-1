40|$|It has {{previously}} been {{pointed out that the}} coexistence of infinite-range and short-range interactions causes a system to have a phase transition of the mean-field universality class, in which the cluster size is finite even at the critical point. In the present paper, we study this property in a model of <b>bistable</b> <b>molecules,</b> whose size changes depending on the <b>bistable</b> states. The <b>molecules</b> can move in space, interacting via an elastic interaction. It is known that due to the different sizes, an effective long-range interaction between the spins appears, and thus this model has a mean-field type of phase transition. It is found that the scaling properties of the shift of the critical temperature from the pure short-range limit in the model with infinite-range and short-range interactions hold also in the present model, regarding the ratio {{of the size of the}} two states as a control parameter for the strength of the long-range interaction. By studying the structure factor, it is shown that the dependence of the cluster size at the critical temperature also shows the same scaling properties as a previously studied model with both infinite-range and short-range interactions. We therefore conclude that these scaling relations hold universally in hybrid models with both short-range and weak long-range interactions...|$|R
40|$|A {{class of}} <b>bistable</b> "stator-rotor" <b>molecules</b> is proposed, where a {{stationary}} bridge (stator) connects the two electrodes and facilitates electron transport between them. The rotor part, {{which has a}} large dipole moment, is attached to an atom of the stator via a single sigma bond. Hydrogen bonds formed between the rotor and stator make the symmetric orientation of the dipole unstable. The rotor has two potential minima with equal energy for rotation about the sigma bond. The dipole orientation, which determines the conduction state of the molecule, can be switched by an external electric field that changes the relative energy of the two potential minima. Both orientation of the rotor correspond to asymmetric current-voltage characteristics that are the reverse of each other, so they are distinguishable electrically. Such <b>bistable</b> stator-rotor <b>molecules</b> could potentially be used as parts of molecular electronic devices. Comment: 8 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{and carbon}} nanotube field effect transistors (CNFETs) have demonstrated extraordi-nary properties and are widely accepted as {{the building blocks}} of next generation VLSI circuits. However, no nanoelectronic ar-chitecture has been proposed which is solely based on carbon nan-otubes and carbon nanotube field effect transistors. The reasons include lack of a self-assembly technology which could form com-plex carbon nanotube structures, or, absence of a reconfigurable carbon nanotube device which could provide functionality, relia-bility, and performance via reconfigurability. In this paper, I pro-pose a novel double gate carbon nanotube field effect transistor (RDG-CNFET), which is reconfigurable to be open, short, FET, or via.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the static operations of conventional semiconductor devices, the dynamic conformational freedom in molecular devices opens up {{the possibility of using}} molecules as new types of devices such as a molecular conformational switch or for molecular data storage. <b>Bistable</b> <b>molecules,</b> with e. g. two stable cis and trans isomeric configurations, could provide, once clamped between two electrodes, a switching phenomenon in the nonequilibrium current response. Here, we model molecular switch junctions formed at silicon contacts and demonstrate the potential of tunable molecular switches in electrode/molecule/electrode configurations. Using the non equilibrium Green function approach implemented with the density-functional-based tight-binding theory, a series of properties such as electron transmissions, I-V characteristics in the different isomer-conformations, and potential energy surfaces {{as a function of the}} reaction coordinates along the trans to cis transition were calculated. Furthermore, in order to investigate stability of molecular switches in ambient conditions, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at room temperature were performed and time- dependent fluctuations of the conductance along the MD pathways were calculated. Our numerical results show that the transmission spectra of the cis isomers are more conductive than trans counterparts inside the bias window for all two model molecules. The current-voltage characteristics consequently show the same trends. Additionally, the calculations of time-dependent transmission fluctuations along the MD pathways have shown that the transmission in cis isomers is always significantly larger than that of trans counterparts showing that molecular switches can be expected to work as robust molecular switching components...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, quinone {{derivative}} molecules {{supported on}} a Cu(110) surface are studied using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). The experimentally investigated system {{is based on}} the bistable nature of these compounds, and so the work is introduced in the wider context of molecular electronics (Chapter 1). The theory and experimental techniques are also described (Chapters 2 and 3). In Chapter 4 the switching behaviour of azophenine (AP) and azotolyline (AT) is characterised using STM imaging and spectroscopy, and is demonstrated to be based on a hydrogen tautomerisation reaction. The activation energy for switching is quantified by measurement of the rate of switching as a function of varying bias voltage, and the process is determined to be stimulated by inelastic electron tunnelling. The reaction pathway is also revealed using theoretical modelling. Chapter 5 focusses on the condensed phase of AP on the Cu(110) surface. The switching behaviour is found to be largely quenched in the self-assembled phase, so statistical analyses of the AP-AP and AP-Cu interactions are conducted {{in order to try to}} explain this. Chapter 6 returns to the study of isolated AP molecules and investigates the spatial dependence of the switch with respect to the location of electronic excitation. It is shown that the final state of the molecule can be accurately selected by exciting specific functional groups within the molecule. This control originates from the non-degenerate reaction pathways for the sequential transfer of the two tautomeric protons. The work is then discussed in terms of future outlook and potential applications for <b>bistable</b> <b>molecules...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Analysis of {{secondary}} structure transition {{is important for}} designing <b>bistable</b> DNA/RNA <b>molecules.</b> To make reliable molecular ma-chines out of such molecules, {{it is necessary to}} estimate the height of the energy barrier to the structure transition.

These paths can be used as criteria for evaluating structure transitions. Then, we in-troduce algorithms to obtain or approximate these optimized paths. The algorithm that Morgan and Higgs used to obtain the globally optimized direct path is analyzed and improved as an algorithm on a bipartite graph.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{question}} of how symmetric double minimum potentials of isolated <b>bistable</b> <b>molecules</b> are affected in the ordered or disordered solid state, in a timescale of slow molecular motion. It is shown that high resolution solid state NMR under conditions of magic angle spinning (MAS) and cross-polarization (CP) can contribute to answering this question. In particular, variable temperature high resolution solid state ''N CPMAS NMR spectra (CP = cross polarization, MAS = magic angle spinning) of ISN enriched tetraaza[14]annulene dyes in the crystalline state and imbedded in disordered glassy polystyrene are presented. These dyes interconvert fast between different tautomeric states whose gasphase degeneracy is lifted in the solid. By contrast to the crystalline state where all dye molecules experience the same solid state perturbation i. e. the same equilibrium constants of tautomerism, molecules dissolved in the glass exist in a multitude of different inequivalent sites with different solid state perturbations. This effect leads to a broad distribution of equilibrium constants of dye tautomerism. This interpretation is confirmed by NMR lineshape simulations and two-dimensional I 5 N CPMAS NMR experiments by which the temperature dependent distribution can be characterized. High temperature experiments in the region of the glass transition give insights into the process leading to motionally averaged symmetric double minimum potential of tautomerism within the NMR timescale. Thus, solid solution NMR studies provide information about elementary steps of molecular rearrangements in a timescale of slow solvent reorientation. In addition, dyes such as tetraaza[14]annulenes can be used as novel NMR probes for microscopic order and motion in glasses. 1. Introduction considerable interest in physics and chemistry [I- 31.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a picture on}} the thermo-elastic behavior of polymer molecules with biological relevance. In particular, this essay deals with the thermo-elasticity of single polymer molecules subjected to uniform stretching (generated by an applied force) or non-uniform stretching (generated by an external field). Analytical expressions and molecular dynamics simulations are elaborated considering some generalizations of the freely-jointed chain (FJC) and the worm-like chain (WLC) models. The analytical theory, based on classical statistical mechanics, allows a rigorous mathematical treatment, while the study of complex systems is covered by means of Monte Carlo simulations. On the one hand, the uniform stretching of a single polymer, imposed by an external pulling force, is pursued for studying the statistical mechanics of small molecules. When the thermodynamic limit is not satisfied, different boundary conditions (either Helmholtz or Gibbs ensemble) yield different elastic behavior, showing the fascinating intrication native to the thermodynamics of small systems. This complexity is shown {{to be even more}} suggestive when investigating <b>bistable</b> <b>molecules</b> of which domains exhibit transitions between two stable states. This scenario leads from cooperative to non-cooperative response of each domain to the external force, depending on the specific statistical ensemble considered. Universal scaling laws are provided, governing the overall elasticity of the polymer systems. On the other hand, the non-uniform stretching of a single molecule, imposed by an external field, is studied to analyze the average configurational properties of polymers and leads to another very intricating scenario concerning the behavior of the variances describing the fluctuations of the system. Furthermore, for the WLC model our attention fall in the investigation of the forceextension curve, for which we derive new approximated expressions for a chain immersed into an external field...|$|R

It is shown both theoretically and experimentally, that ionizing radiation in the form of heavy charged particles is capable of changing the information originally stored on the ORAM material. The magnitude and spatial distribution of these changes are used as a measure of the absorbed dose, particle type and energy. The effects of exposure on 3 D ORAM materials have been investigated for a variety of particle types and energies, including protons, alpha particles and 12 C ions.

40|$|Among <b>bistable</b> {{photochromic}} <b>molecules,</b> diarylethenes (DAEs) {{possess the}} distinct feature that upon photoisomerization they undergo a large modulation of their π-electronic system, {{accompanied by a}} marked shift of the HOMO/LUMO energies and hence oxidation/reduction potentials. The electronic modulation can be utilized to remote-control charge- as well as energy-transfer processes {{and it can be}} transduced to functional entities adjacent to the DAE core, thereby regulating their properties. In order to exploit such photoswitchable systems it is important to precisely adjust the absolute position of their HOMO and LUMO levels and to maximize the extent of the photoinduced shifts of these energy levels. Here, we present a comprehensive study detailing how variation of the substitution pattern of DAE compounds, in particular using strongly electron-accepting and chemically stable trifluoromethyl groups either in the periphery or at the reactive carbon atoms, allows for the precise tuning of frontier molecular orbital levels over a broad energy range and the generation of photoinduced shifts of more than 1  eV. Furthermore, the effect of different DAE architectures on the transduction of these shifts to an adjacent functional group is discussed. Whereas substitution in the periphery of the DAE motif has only minor implications on the photochemistry, trifluoromethylation at the reactive carbon atoms strongly disturbs the isomerization efficiency. However, this can be overcome by using a nonsymmetrical substitution pattern or by combination with donor groups, rendering the resulting photoswitches attractive candidates for the construction of remote-controlled functional systems.

40|$|The primary metric for gauging {{progress}} in the various semiconductor integrated circuit technologies is the spacing, or pitch, between the most closely spaced wires within a {{dynamic random access memory}} (DRAM) circuit. Modern DRAM circuits have 140 nm pitch wires and a memory cell size of 0. 0408 μm^ 2. Improving integrated circuit technology will require that these dimensions decrease over time. However, at present a large fraction of the patterning and materials requirements that we expect to need for the construction of new integrated circuit technologies in 2013 have ‘no known solution’. Promising ingredients for advances in integrated circuit technology are nanowires, molecular electronics and defect-tolerant architectures, as demonstrated by reports of single devices and small circuits. Methods of extending these approaches to large-scale, high-density circuitry are largely undeveloped. Here we describe a 160, 000 -bit molecular electronic memory circuit, fabricated at a density of 10 ^(11) bits cm^(- 2) (pitch 33 nm; memory cell size 0. 0011 mm^ 2), that is, roughly analogous to the dimensions of a DRAM circuit projected to be available by 2020.

40|$|Two switchable, palindromically {{constituted}} bistable [3]rotaxanes {{have been}} designed and synthesized {{with a pair of}} mechanically mobile rings encircling a single dumbbell. These designs are reminiscent of a “molecular muscle” for the purposes of amplifying and harnessing molecular mechanical motions. The location of the two cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) (CBPQT^(4 +)) rings can be controlled to be on either tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) or naphthalene (NP) stations, either chemically (1 H NMR spectroscopy) or electrochemically (cyclic voltammetry), such that switching of inter-ring distances from 4. 2 to 1. 4 nm mimics the contraction and extension of skeletal muscle, albeit on a shorter length scale. Fast scan-rate cyclic voltammetry at low temperatures reveals stepwise oxidations and movements of one-half of the [3]rotaxane and then of the other, a process that appears to be concerted at room temperature. The active form of the bistable [3]rotaxane bears disulfide tethers attached covalently to both of the CBPQT^(4 +) ring components for the purpose of its self-assembly onto a gold surface. An array of flexible microcantilever beams, each coated on one side with a monolayer of 6 billion of the active <b>bistable</b> [3]rotaxane <b>molecules,</b> undergoes controllable and reversible bending up and down when it is exposed to the synchronous addition of aqueous chemical oxidants and reductants.

40|$|Abstract. Surfaces whose {{macroscopic}} properties can be switched {{by light}} are potentially useful {{in a wide}} variety of applications. One such promising application is electrochemical sensors that can be gated by optically switching the electrode on or off. One way to make such a switchable electrode is by depositing a self-assembled monolayer of <b>bistable,</b> optically switchable <b>molecules</b> onto an electrode surface. Quantitative application of any such sensor requires understanding how changes in interfacial field affect the composition of photostationary states, i. e. how does electrode potential affect the extent to which the electrode is on or off when irradiated, and the structure of the SAM. Here we address these questions for a SAM of a 6 -nitro-substituted spiro[2 H- 1 -benzopyran- 2, 2 ’-indoline] covalently attached through a dithiolane linker to an Au electrode immersed in a 0. 1 M solution of Tetramethylammonium hexafluorophosphate in Acetonitrile using interface-specific vibrational spectroscopy. We find that in the absence of irradiation, when the SAM is dominated by the closed spiropyran form, variations in potential of 1 V have little effect on spiropyran relative stability. In contrast, under UV irradiation small changes in potential can have dramatic effects: changes in potential of 0. 2 V can completely destabilize the open, merocyanine form of the SAM relative to the spiropyran and dramatically change the chromophore orientation. Quantitatively accounting for these effects is necessary to employ this, or any other optically switchable bistable chromophore, in electrochemical applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{nanometer}} regime {{covers the}} transition from condensed matter behavior to atomic and molecular properties and thus is a very rich but also very demanding area in materials science. Close to the condensed matter side, properties and functions might still very well be scalable, whereas close to the atomic and molecular side, the scalability is mostly lost. Properties and functions change qualitatively or quantitatively by orders of magnitude when the dimensions become smaller than a critical size in the nanometer range. Examples are the ballistic regime for electron or spin transport at dimensions below the mean free path, near-field effects in scanning near-field optical microscopy and quantum wells when the dimensions are below an appropriate wavelength, novel electronic, mechanical, and chemical properties {{when the number of}} bulk atoms becomes smaller than that of surface atoms, quantum conduction, and Coulomb blockade. Thus, by going below a certain size, an abundance of novel properties and functions are at one's disposal, or, in other words, we can functionalize materials simply by reducing their size to the nanoscale. The key to the future lies in the functions that we give to materials, not just in finding 'novel functional materials'. This catch expression in many materials science programs and initiatives {{of the past two decades}} sounds great, but it is not what really counts. All materials are functional in one way or another and, therefore, all new materials are 'novel functional materials'. Certainly, finding new materials is always an important part of progress, but we should also focus on the much larger domain of novel functions that we can give to existing or modified materials. A good example is semiconductors: they are fifty or more years old and their properties are very well known, but they were not of widespread interest and use until the transistor changed their destiny into being the central material in the information technology revolution. Interfaces gave them their functions, and shaping them into ever-smaller functional components made them indispensably omnipresent as transistors—produced in billions per person and per year—and they are no doubt the rulers of today's technical world. The semiconductor and transistor serve as an inspiring example of functionalizing materials. The developments of microelectronics profited very much from scalability, that is, the properties and functions do not change significantly with size. Therefore, every step toward smaller dimensions was a technical and commercial challenge with risks well under control. The transition to the nanoscale, however, is discontinuous. Examples of this transition are the local probe methods that exploit the mechanically controlled proximity to the object under consideration and that have become indispensable as microscopes and as measuring and modifying tools, the size of molecular components that are much smaller than the smallest possibly achievable transistor, the properties and functions of materials below a critical size as mentioned above, the continuum properties versus discrete ones, and novel concepts inspired by living nature. Those novel concepts include growing circuits first and building the active components at the nodes afterwards and measuring weak by weak, small by small, and many by many. It is these discontinuous steps that make the nanoscale different, not just smaller. They pose exciting challenges, open great opportunities and nearly unlimited possibilities, but they also carry serious technical, commercial, environmental, and health risks. The nanoscale is also a great opportunity for materials science in general. Materials science is interdisciplinary per se. A materials scientist should have a reasonable understanding of physics, chemistry, engineering, and more recently, also biology. Certainly one can always team up with representatives from other disciplines and forge collaborations. However, an effective team can only emerge from a common understanding of the respective languages and problems. The lack of such an understanding is the Achilles' heel of so many collaborations. Despite the intrinsic interdisciplinary nature, materials science has split into various segments according to the type of material, for example, metals, organic, inorganic, biological, molecular, and so on. Each of them leads an independent life with little understanding for the others. This segmentation has made materials science lose, to an undesirable extent, its all-embracing mission for science and technology. There are laudable efforts to reunite different branches of materials science into comprehensive institutions; examples are NIMS in Tsukuba and IMR at Tohoku University, but institutions alone do not make the day. The nanoscale provides an excellent opportunity for scientists. The nanoscale was the bifurcation point where disciplines split and developed their own disciplinary views and language. This was the necessary core for the tremendous developments of science. Technology always had to rely on broader views. Now, disciplines merge again at the nanoscale, which will hopefully bring back to materials science much of what was lost over recent decades. It is difficult to delimit the nanodomain using general criteria since everything consists of atoms that are roughly a third of a nanometer in size, as is their distance from each other in condensed matter. In most cases, the individual addressabilities of nanostructures, properties, and processes are important. Atoms emerged from the anonymity as members of an ensemble; they have become our partners as individuals. As upper limits for nano, we might agree on 100 – 200 nm in object size and 1 – 10 nm in accuracy for local positioning, measuring, modifying, and controlling processes. The lower limit is open; a hundredth of a nanometer in positioning and measuring is nothing extraordinary. As a reviewer, I would accept a very interesting and daring research proposal, even if it interprets 'nano' somewhat too generously. After all, we want to promote top-class research and not average research just for the sake of 'nano'. Interfaces, material growth at given nano positions, shaping materials to a given nanosize and form, and bistability are key elements for functionalizing materials. InterfacesThe role of interfaces is rapidly increasing in science and technology. The number of interfaces increases with the square of the number of phases of materials. Even if the majority of them are impractical or useless, they are still much more abundant than the materials themselves, and they are the key to new functions. Think of the simple 'mechanical' interface responsible for the lotus effect where wetting is prevented by the rapidly changing surface curvature due to nanoparticles. Think of all the connections of a nanometer-sized area between very different materials, for example, for electron or spin transport. Think of the delicate interfaces that protect nanofunctional units from the environment but allow for communication of various types with other nanocomponents or with the macroscopic world. The solid–liquid interface plays a special role here. For me, it is the interface of the future, both for local growth and removal of nm 3 quantities and for working with biological specimens requiring a liquid environment. Interfaces are the 'faces of action' and nanoscale materials science will be, to a great extent, 'interface science'. There is no need to change the name; attentive awareness suffices. Material growth at given nano positionsThis is the second central challenge in nanoscale materials science, but maybe still a futuristic one. We have heard much about the extraordinary properties of carbon nanotubes. They do a great job in certain applications, like tips of scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopes or nanoinjection needles or as bundles for electron emission or electron transport. As single carbon nanotubes of various lengths in complex micro- and nano-electronic circuits, however, they have to be grown at given positions, which is still problematic. Another example concerns the assembly scenario for electronics, components like sensors, actuators, and nano-systems. Macromolecular chemistry is producing highly functional macromolecules, but, eventually, they have to be produced and assembled at given positions. Shaping materials to a given nanosize and formIn the field of micro- and nanoelectronics, shaping semiconductors, many oxides, and selected metals down to 20 – 100 nm dimensions is standard. In nanomechanics, however, other materials might be more appropriate and better suited for a given task. In other cases, finishing procedures might be impossible or too time-consuming for large numbers of them. Components for counting electrons—more elegant and smaller than today's single-electron transistors—or adjustable holes for counting atoms and molecules will eventually be badly needed because of the 1 /√N fluctuations in the properties and measurements at a small N, for example, N dopants in nanosize transistors or N electrons in very short current pulses. Bistable componentsBistable components, which do not require electrical currents, are aimed at reducing local energy dissipation and faster startup of personal computers. Magnetoresistive and ferroelectric random access memory (MRAMS and FRAMS) devices are the first attempts to use them in circuits. I am not aware of reported switching times that are considerably faster than a few nanoseconds, as required in today's storage. This is too slow for memory and much too slow for possible logic devices based on two-terminal <b>bistable</b> components. <b>Bistable</b> <b>molecules,</b> a mechanical switch, might be a valid and sufficiently fast alternative, certainly with all the challenges mentioned above. I have mentioned just a few obvious examples of the involvement of materials science in the new world of nanodimensions. However, for materials scientists, the sky is the limit. The thoughts given above are partly reflected in the lectures that I have recently given in Japan. It is my pleasure to thank my colleagues for the mutual understanding and hospitality that I always experience in Japan...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{thesis is}} concerned with the elucidation of structural changes of RNA molecules during the time course of dynamic processes that are commonly denoted as folding reactions. In contrast to the field of protein folding, the concept of RNA folding comprises not only folding reactions itself but also refolding- or conformational switching- and assembly processes (see chapter III). The method in this thesis to monitor these diverse processes is high resolution liquid-state NMR spectroscopy. To understand the reactions is of considerable interest, because most biological active RNA molecules function by changing their conformation. This can be either an intrinsic property of their respective sequence or may happen in response to a cellular signal such as small molecular ligand binding (like in the aptamer and riboswitch case), protein or metal binding. The first part of the thesis (chapters II & III) provides a general overview over the field of RNA structure and RNA folding. The two chapters aim at introducing the reader into the current status of research in the field. Chapters II is structured such that primary structure is first described then secondary and tertiary structure elements of RNA structure. A special emphasis is given to bistable RNA systems that are functionally important and represent models to understand fundamental questions of RNA conformational switching. RNA folding in vitro as well as in vivo situations is discussed in Chapter III. The following chapters IV and V also belong to the introduction part and review critically the NMR methods that were used to understand the nature and the dynamics of the conformational/structural transitions in RNA. A general overview of NMR methods quantifying dynamics of biomolecules is provided in chapter IV. A detailed discussion of solvent exchange rates and time-resolved NMR, as the two major techniques used, follows. In the final chapter V of the first part the NMR parameters used in structure calculation and structure calculation itself are conferred. The second part of the thesis, which is the cumulative part, encompasses the conducted original work. Chapter VI reviews the general NMR techniques applied and explains their applicability in the field of RNA structural and biochemical studies in several model cases. Chapter VII describes the achievement of a complete resonance assignment of an RNA model molecule (14 mer cUUCGg tetral-loop RNA) and introduces a new technique to assign quaternary carbon resonances of the nucleobases. Furthermore, it reports on a conformational analysis of the sugar backbone in this RNA hairpin molecule in conjunction with a parameterization of 1 J scalar couplings. Achievements: • Establishment of two new NMR pulse-sequences facilitating the assignment of quaternary carbons in RNA nucleobases • First complete (99. 5 %) NMR resonance assignment of an RNA molecule (14 mer) including 1 H, 13 C, 15 N, 31 P resonances • Description of RNA backbone conformation by a complete set of NMR parameters • Description of the backbone conformational dependence in RNA of new NMR parameters (1 J scalar couplings) Chapters VII & VIII summarize the real-NMR studies that were conducted to elucidate the conformational switching events of several RNA systems. Chapter VIII gives an overview on the experiments that were accomplished on three different <b>bistable</b> RNAs. These <b>molecules</b> where chosen to be good model systems for RNA refolding reactions and so consequently served as reporters of conformational switching events of RNA secondary structure elements. Achievements: • First kinetic studies of RNA refolding reactions with atomic resolution by NMR • Application of [new] RT-NMR techniques either regarding the photolytic initiation of the reaction or regarding the readout of the reaction • Discovery of different RNA refolding mechanisms for different RNA molecules Deciphering of a general rule for RNA refolding methodology to conformational switching processes of RNA tertiary structure elements. The models for these processes were a) the guanine-dependent riboswitch RNA and b) the minimal hammerhead ribozyme. Achievements: • NMR spectroscopic assignment of imino-resonances of the hypoxanthine bound guanine-dependent riboswitch RNA • Application of RT-NMR techniques to monitor the ligand induced conformational switch of the aptamer domain of the guanine-dependent riboswitch RNA at atomic resolution • Translation of kinetic information into structural information • Deciphering a folding mechanism for the guanine riboswitch aptamer domain • Application of RT-NMR techniques to monitor the reaction of the catalytically active mHHR RNA at atomic resolution In the appendices the new NMR pulse-sequences and the experimental parameters are described, which are not explicitly treated in the respective manuscripts. Die vorliegende Doktorarbeit beschäftigt sich mit den strukturellen Änderungen in RNA Molekülen während dynamischer konformationeller Änderungen, die gemeinhin als RNA-Faltung bezeichnet werden. Im Gegensatz zur Proteinfaltung sind RNA-Faltungsprozesse nicht exklusiv als die Faltung einer definierten Konformation aus einem Ensemble an ungefalteten, d. h. ausgehend von unstrukturierten Molekülen, zu verstehen. RNA-Faltung beinhaltet vielmehr die strukturelle Umwandlung verschiedener stabiler Konformationen (die als RNA-Umfaltung benannt wird) und den Aufbau von molekularen Komplexen aus mehreren Molekülen (siehe Kapitel III). Die experimentelle Technik, die hier zur Untersuchung dieser Prozesse genutzt wurde, ist die hochauflösende Flüssig-NMR-Spektroskopie. Das Verständnis der strukturellen und biophysikalischen Grundlagen solcher Umfaltungsreaktionen von RNA ist essentiell, da solche konformationellen Änderungen die biologische Funktion der Moleküle modulieren. Dabei ist zu bemerken, dass eine Umfaltungsreaktion eine intrinsische Eigenschaft einer gegebenen RNA-Sequenz sein kann oder die Antwort auf ein externes zelluläres Signal, wie die Bindung eines niedermolekularen Liganden (z. B. in Aptameren und in Riboswitch RNAs), eines Proteins oder eines Metall-Ions. Der erste Teil dieser Doktorarbeit (Kapitel I & II) hält einen Überblick über die Themengebiete RNA-Struktur und RNA-Faltung bereit. Beide Kapitel führen in den derzeitigen Stand der Forschung ein. Kapitel II führt dabei entlang der hierarchischen Ordnung von RNA Molekülen und diskutiert die Eigenschaften von Primär-, Sekundär- und Tertiär-Strukturelementen. Ein besonderes Augenmerk wird dabei auf bistabile RNA Systeme gelegt; ihre wichtige biologische Funktionalität wird dargestellt, ebenso wird das Potential ausgeleuchtet, diese funktionale Klasse von RNA Molekülen als Modellsysteme zu nutzen, um fundamentale Fragen zu konformationellen Übergängen in RNA zu beantworten. In Kapitel III folgt sodann die Diskussion über RNA-Faltung in in vitro Experimenten als auch im zellulären Kontext (in vivo). Die Kapitel IV und V besprechen die NMR-spektroskopischen Techniken, die genutzt werden, um die Art und die dynamischen Eigenschaften von konformationellen/strukturellen Umwandlungen in RNA zu untersuchen. Hierbei wird der Schwerpunkt auf die verwendeten Techniken des Wasseraustauschs an labilen Protonen und der zeitaufgelösten NMR-Spektroskopie gelegt. Der zweite Teil der Doktorarbeit fasst kumulativ die durchgeführten Studien zusammen. Kapitel VI bespricht hierbei die grundlegenden NMR Techniken, die zur Strukturaufklärung von RNA Molekülen angewendet werden und zeigt deren Anwendungsmöglichkeiten an unterschiedlichen Beispielen von strukturellen und biochemischen Studien. Das folgende Kapitel VII beschreibt die komplette Resonanzzuordnung eines RNA Modell-Moleküls (14 mer cUUCGg tetra-loop RNA) und stellt eine neue Pulstechnik vor, die zur Zuordnung der Resonanzen von quatären Kohlenstoffen in Purinbasen benützt werden kann. Weiterhin schließt sich ein Report an, wie die Konformation des Zuckerrückgrates in RNA-Molekülen bestimmt wird und schlägt mittels einer an oben genanntem Modellsystem durchgeführte Parametrisierung 1 J skalare Kopplungen als neue Strukturparameter vor. Kapitel VII & VIII fassen die hierzu durchgeführten RT-NMR Studien zusammen. Kapitel VIII gibt hierbei einen Überblick über die Untersuchungen an drei bistabilen RNA-Systemen. Diese Moleküle wurden ausgewählt, da sie als Modelle für RNA-Umfaltungsreakionen dienen. Das finale Kapitel IX behandelt die Anwendung der oben ausgeführten neuen Methodologie auf konformationelle Umwandlungen von RNA Tertiär-Strukturelementen: a) Guanin-abhängige Riboswitch RNA (GSW) und b) Minimales "hammerhead" Ribozym (mHHR) ...|$|R
