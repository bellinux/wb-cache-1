The story, on publication, offended some Christians and was banned in Ireland by the <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Censors.</b>|$|E

50|$|Though {{the first}} film in India (Raja Harishchandra) was {{produced}} in 1913 by Dadasaheb Phalke, the Indian Cinematograph Act was passed and came into effect only in 1920. Censor Boards (as they were called then) were placed under police chiefs in cities of Madras (now Chennai), Bombay (now Mumbai), Calcutta (now Kolkata), Lahore (now in Pakistan) and Rangoon (now Yangon in Burma). Regional censors were independent. After Independence autonomy <b>of</b> regional <b>censors</b> was abolished and they were brought under the Bombay <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Film <b>Censors.</b> With implementation <b>of</b> Cinematograph Act, 1952, the board was unified and reconstituted, as the Central <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Film <b>Censors.</b> Cinematograph (Certification) Rules were revised in 1983 and since then the Central <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Film <b>Censors</b> {{became known as the}} Central <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Film Certification.|$|R
25|$|Rather than leasing prints to exhibitors, the {{distributor}} rented theaters that specialized in foreign and art films {{for the purpose}} of screening Caligula exclusively, to keep the film out of theaters that showed pornographic films. In 1981, the Brazilian <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Censors</b> approved the establishment of special theaters to screen In the Realm of the Senses and Caligula because they were international box office hits.|$|E

Each film passed by the censors had to include a stamp on each reel, and each item of printed advertising had to contain the stamp, too. The National Police was responsible for screening films and videos until September 2005, when the government's Ministry of Culture took over the function. Every VCD and DVD sold for home viewing must bear a stamp that it has passed the Censorship Board.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the Manila Film Center, the Philippines did {{not have}} an {{official}} national film archive which is why on January 1981, then first lady Imelda Marcos spearheaded the building of the first Manila Center. Under the supervision of Betty Benitez, the spouse of then Deputy MHS Minister Jose Conrado Benitez, they organized a group to pursue the project. Ramon M. Ignacio, Senior Technology Officer at the Technology Resource Center, conceptualized the project and its various components. He likewise prepared the feasibility study. Among the Film Center's project components were: the 360-degree theater to show past and present historical and tourism scenes for future generations; the Film Financing/Loan Program to address funding of meritable films, the Filipino Film Archiving using Digital Storage (though was little known during those times); Film Database/Information system; Film Making and Blow Up Laboratory; Viewing rooms for the <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Censors</b> and other minor sub-components. However, despite the futuristic and concept creativity of Ignacio, only two of the project components were actually done. Unesco's assistance was invaluable {{in the design of the}} archives, so they were asked to be consultants of the project. Several ocular visits were done by Unesco in 1981 where they were responsible for major consultations needed in the structure's erection. The building was then designed to have two components which were the auditoria and archives. According to Hong, the foundation was set on reclaimed land near the Manila Bay. Since the deadline of the structure was tight, it required 4,000 workers, working in 3 shifts across 24 hours. One thousand workers constructed the lobby in 72 hours, a job which would normally entail six weeks of labor. The Film Center opened in 1982 costing an estimate of $25 million.|$|E

Danger: Diabolik was submitted to the Italian <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Censors</b> in December 1967 and, after five brief cuts {{were made to the}} film, it was released in Italy on January 24, 1968. The film was described by Curti as a [...] "financial disappointment for De Laurentiis" [...] with a gross of only slightly more than 265 million lire. It opened in Paris in April 1968 under the title Danger Diabolik. In the United States, the film opened in New York in December 1968.|$|E

2500|$|Verdi soon {{stumbled}} upon Victor Hugo's five-act play Le roi s'amuse. He later explained that [...] "The subject is grand, immense, {{and there is}} a character {{that is one of the}} greatest creations that the theatre can boast of, in any country and in all history." [...] It was a highly controversial subject, and Hugo himself had already had trouble with censorship in France, which had banned productions after its first performance nearly twenty years earlier (it would not be performed again until 1882). As Austria at that time directly controlled much of Northern Italy, it came before the Austrian <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Censors.</b> Hugo's play depicted a king (Francis I of France) as an immoral and cynical womanizer, something that was not accepted in Europe during the Restoration period.|$|E
6000|$|Or turn if {{one will}} {{to the moral}} side. The older way of being good was by much prayer and much effort of one's own soul. Now it is done by a <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Censors.</b> There {{is no need to}} fight sin by the power of the spirit: let the <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Censors</b> do it. They {{together}} with three or four kinds of Commissioners are supposed to keep sin at arm's length and to supply a first class legislative guarantee of righteousness. As a short cut to morality and as a way of saving individual effort our legislatures are turning out morality legislation by the bucketful. The legislature regulates our drink, it begins already to guard us against the deadly cigarette, it regulates here and there the length of our skirts, it safeguards our amusements and in two states of the American Union it even proposes to save us from the teaching of the Darwinian Theory of evolution. The ancient prayer [...] "Lead us not into temptation" [...] is passing out of date. The way to temptation is declared closed by Act of Parliament and by amendment to the constitution of the United States. Yet oddly enough the moral tone of the world fails to respond. The world is apparently more full of thugs, hold-up men, yeg-men, bandits, motor-thieves, porch-climbers, spotters, spies and crooked policemen than it ever was; till it almost seems that the slow, old-fashioned method of an effort of the individual soul may be needed still before the world is made good.|$|E
6000|$|All this {{is changed}} in America. A {{university}} professor {{is now a}} busy, hustling person, approximating as closely to a business man as he can do it. It is on the business man that he models himself. He has a little place that he calls his [...] "office," [...] with a typewriter machine and a stenographer. Here he sits and dictates letters, beginning after the best business models, [...] "in re yours of the eighth ult., would say, etc., etc." [...] He writes these letters to students, to his fellow professors, to the president, indeed to any people who will let him write to them. The number of letters that he writes each month is duly counted and set to his credit. If he writes enough he will get a reputation as an [...] "executive," [...] and big things may happen to him. He may even be asked {{to step out of}} the college and take a post as an [...] "executive" [...] in a soap company or an advertising firm. The man, in short, is a [...] "hustler," [...] an [...] "advertiser" [...] whose highest aim is to be a [...] "live-wire." [...] If he is not, he will presently be dismissed, or, to use the business term, be [...] "let go," [...] by a board of trustees who are themselves hustlers and live-wires. As to the professor's soul, he no longer needs to think of it as it has been handed over along with all the others to a <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Censors.</b>|$|E
