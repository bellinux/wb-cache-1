25|$|If all looting is wrong, as {{in theory}} it is, {{then they have}} been to blame: <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when {{the laws of nature}} assert {{themselves}} over the laws of civilization, and this was a case in point. You must remember that these men had just endured a long siege, that they had been bereft of everything they possessed and that they had hundreds of men, similarly destitute, who were dependent upon them. What was their position? Had they come to me and said, 'Give us money and food,' I could only have replied in the negative, or, at all events, to the effect that I could not feed their converts, and so they took the law into their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I do not admit that the missionaries abused it. I have not heard of a single instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.|$|E
25|$|Doro's {{character}} {{plays an}} important role in the novel because he has total control over all of the other characters. Part of the reason that Doro has so much control is because he determines whether one lives or dies. Doro has the gift and curse of being able to take on the body of anyone he desires. This is a gift because he is immortal, but it is a curse because when a body gets old, it is mandatory that he changes bodies in order to live. In order for Doro to survive, he must kill. This causes the other characters to be very wary of how they behave around Doro because they know that their life can be over at any moment. Another reason that Doro has so much control is because he is a man. The fact that he is a man makes it much easier for him to control other women, especially Anyanwu. Anyanwu is physically strong enough to fight Doro, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> where she does not retaliate against his physical abuse. Doro uses sex to draw women close to him and to create an emotional bond that makes it hard for them to leave.|$|E
500|$|By 1972, {{after being}} a {{performer}} for nearly ten years, Morrison began experiencing stage fright when performing for audiences of thousands, {{as opposed to}} the hundreds as he had experienced in his early career. He became anxious on stage and had difficulty establishing eye contact with the audience. He once said in an interview about performing on stage, [...] "I dig singing the songs <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when it's pretty agonising for me to be out there." [...] After a brief break from music, he started appearing in clubs, regaining his ability to perform live, albeit with smaller audiences.|$|E

Buehrle, an animal rights activist, told MLB.com [...] "he had a great year and a great comeback, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> where we watched the game, and I know it's bad to say, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>times</b> where we hope he gets hurt...everything you've done to these dogs, something bad needs to happen to these guys." ...|$|R

Created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto, he {{is portrayed as}} {{a citizen of the}} Mushroom Kingdom and is one of Princess Peach's most loyal attendants; constantly working on her behalf. He is usually seen as a non-player character (NPC) who provides assistance to Mario and his friends in most games, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when Toad(s) takes center stage and appears as a protagonist, as seen in Super Mario Bros. 2, Wario's Woods, Super Mario 3D World, and [...]|$|E
2500|$|In January 2011, TobyMac {{stated that}} a reunion tour would {{probably}} happen [...] "sooner or later". He mentioned talking with Michael and Kevin about [...] "when it should be" [...] and [...] "what it could look like." [...] Fans {{hoping for a}} reunion tour {{in the near future}} may be disappointed: [...] "Right now, I think we're really just enjoying the mountain we're climbing, each of us individually. It's never been a completely closed door. We've always sort of laughed about it, smiled about it. It's timing, I guess." [...] On May 28 and 29, 2011, at the Big Church Day Out in Wiston, UK, TobyMac joined the Newsboys twice to perform [...] "Jesus Freak", and Michael sang [...] "In the Light" [...] on both days with Toby's band, Diverse City. In June 2011 Toby admitted that he thought about Kevin and Michael for every song that he writes. His song [...] "Wonderin'" [...] is about his past with Kevin and Michael in DC Talk. [...] "It's just a warm look back at DC Talk," [...] says Toby, almost wistfully. [...] "It's reminiscing about Michael and Kevin and what we did together, and recognizing their influence on me. I love what I do today, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when I wonder, What if we stayed together? I've got these dreams I'm pursuing now, but are they stealing me from you?" [...] On June 7, 2011, Back 2 Back Hits, featuring songs off Jesus Freak and Supernatural, was released.|$|E

60|$|Not {{often have}} two sweeter women grown {{together}} on one stem. What were {{the men of}} Redlintie about?
