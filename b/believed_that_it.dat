5|$|A {{century later}} he was already a legendary figure; William of Tyre <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was Peter who had planted {{the idea for the}} crusade in Urban's mind (which was taken as fact by historians until the 19th century).

Some argue <b>that</b> <b>it</b> strikes us as absurd because belief is normative. The beliefs <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is raining and <b>that</b> one doesn’t <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is are, it is suggested, self-falsifying. But, {{so it is}} argued, it is {{essential}} to belief that beliefs ought not, among other things, be self-falsifying. That is why the beliefs strike us as absurd. I argue that while the absurdity may consist in and be explained by self-falsification, we have no reasons to accept the further claim that self-falsifying beliefs are absurd because violating norms...|$|R

5|$|One {{objection}} is that two-level utilitarianism undermines an agent's {{commitment to}} act in accordance {{with his or her}} moral principles. For example, a theist will comply with his/her moral code because he/she sees it as based upon God's will. However, a two-level utilitarian knows that his everyday set of moral rules is merely a guideline, and as such any breach of these rules is unlikely to accompany the same degree of guilt as would someone who <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was wrong in principle {{to act in}} that way.|$|E
5|$|Peyton Manning and Leaf {{were widely}} {{considered}} {{the two best}} players available in the 1998 draft, and scouts and analysts debated who should be selected first.

5|$|The Italian theologian Francesco Antonio Zaccaria criticised Augustine's {{concept of}} {{evil in the}} eighteenth century. He noted a {{distinction}} between using the term evil to imply blame (sin) and to imply lament (suffering) and argued that Augustine posited sin to have occurred before suffering. This was problematic for Zaccaria, who <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> made Augustine seem offhand and uninterested in human suffering. For Zaccaria, Augustine's perception of evil as a privation did not satisfactorily answer the questions of modern society as to why suffering exists.|$|E
5|$|The humanists <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is {{important}} to transcend to the afterlife with a perfect mind and body, which could be attained with education. The purpose of humanism {{was to create a}} universal man whose person combined intellectual and physical excellence and who was capable of functioning honorably in virtually any situation. This ideology was referred to as the uomo universale, an ancient Greco-Roman ideal. Education during the Renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history as it was thought that the classics provided moral instruction and an intensive understanding of human behavior.|$|E

5|$|According to Russian {{scholars}} Ivan Yastrebov and Pavel Rovinski, {{the cross}} was originally {{kept in the}} Prečista Krajinska Church, in which Kosara had interred Vladimir. The peak of Islamization of the Krajina region was reached {{at the end of}} 18th century. The church was torn down, though it is uncertain when and by whom, but the cross was preserved by the people of the region. They <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could protect against evil and ensure a rich harvest, and kept it as sacred, although they had converted to Islam. The cross was later taken from them by the neighboring clan of Mrkojevići. As they too converted to Islam, they entrusted the cross to the Andrović family—their Orthodox Christian neighbors. The Mrkojevići considered it more appropriate for the cross to be kept in a Christian home, rather than in a Muslim one.|$|E
