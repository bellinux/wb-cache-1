5|$|The {{township}} derives {{its name}} from the Old English word <b>brāde,</b> meaning broad, and wælla meaning spring. Variant spellings include (dates in brackets): Brade-, -wal, -wale, -walle, Bradwall (1226), Brad(e)well(e) (1281), Brod(e)wall (1324), Beatwall (1326), Broadwall (1415), Bardwell (1438), and, Bradwell (1724). The name was also associated with the local hamlet of Hollinsgreen, where it was referred to as Bradwall et Hollins (c. 1662), and Bradwall cum Hollins (1819). Today, the township also lends its name to the hamlet of Bradwall Green.|$|E
25|$|An {{employee}} of Bake, W. C. <b>Brade,</b> continued his plans, although {{he changed the}} route to run from Amsterdam to Rotterdam, with the original stretch running to Haarlem to test its economic viability. This change in route may have been partly influenced by wealthy investors who were eager for a direct train connection between either of the great Dutch ports (Amsterdam and Rotterdam). King William I was reluctant to have the Netherlands at a competitive disadvantage to the neighbouring countries who were all building railroads. He might also have felt threatened by {{the plans for the}} Iron Rhine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bräde</b> or svenskt brädspel ("Swedish tables") is {{a variant}} played in Sweden. Players starts with all 15 of their {{checkers}} on opposite {{corners of the}} board, and play around counter-clockwise. Besides bearing off, {{there are several other}} ways to win, such as arranging all of one's checkers in certain pre-determined patterns, or by hitting so many checkers that one's opponent can not bring them in again. Additional points are awarded for a victory while one's opponent has checkers on the bar. Brädspel is played without the doubling cube. Interest in brädspel experienced a resurgence following the recovery of a 17th-century board from the wreck of the Vasa.|$|E

2500|$|Christian was {{reckoned}} {{a typical}} renaissance king, and excelled in hiring in musicians and artists {{from all over}} Europe. Many English musicians were employed by him at several times, among them William <b>Brade,</b> John Bull and John Dowland. Dowland accompanied the king on his tours, and as he was employed in 1603, rumour has it he was in Norway as well. Christian was an agile dancer, and his court was reckoned the second most [...] "musical" [...] court in Europe, only ranking behind that of Elizabeth I of England. Christian maintained good contact with his sister Anne, who was married to James VI of Scotland. His other sister, Elizabeth, was married to the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and artists and musicians travelled freely between the courts.|$|E

2500|$|In 1980, the Council {{threatened}} {{to close the}} Hall to save money; this prompted Herne Bay's twelve Council representatives to attempt to save the situation. In 1988 there was a move brought by Councillor Bill <b>Brade</b> and backed by the British Film Institute and police to show films at the Hall because the local Cannon Cinema had been closed and to distract local youth from vandalism. In 1991 staff from the Windsor Cinema in Broadstairs brought portable equipment and seating for converting the Hall into a cinema for three evenings per week plus a children's matinee. In 1993 there was a move to manage the Hall via a local trust composed of the building's user groups, including Herne Bay Operatic Society, Theatrecraft, Herne Bay Active Retirement Association and 691 Promotions. From 1996 to 2004 [...] the Hall was run by Eurest, but the business reverted to Council control for a three-year trial from March 2004 after the contractor served up frozen roast potatoes at a dinner dance in November 2002. The Council's manager from 2004 to 2006 was Tony Farrow who put in a new £20,000 sound system. In 2006 the Council raised hire charges for the Hall from £750 to £1,450 per day, pricing out one of its regular entertainers, Stars in the Afternoon.|$|E
