5|$|All {{of their}} {{material}} {{had been released}} solely on the band's MySpace pagetheir recording contract came after performances at the CMJ Music Festival and Pitchfork Media Music Festival, on July 15, 2007. Eventually, The Cool Kids signed to Chocolate Industries, another independent label. The group has revealed on its MySpace page that The Cool Kids' debut album, When Fish Ride Bicycles, will be released in 2008, though it did not come out until 2011. Ingersoll has been the producer for tracks released thus far, but <b>both</b> <b>work</b> in rapping and production.

5|$|Raised in New South Wales, Brown {{initially}} {{struggled in}} <b>both</b> <b>work</b> and cricket, before gradually rising through the cricket ranks. He made his first-class debut for New South Wales in the 1932–33 season and forced {{his way into}} the national side during the 1934 tour of England. When long-term openers Bill Ponsford and Bill Woodfull retired {{at the end of the}} tour, Brown and his state opening partner Fingleton took over. After poor form made his selection for the 1938 tour of England controversial, Brown responded with a total of 1,854 runs, including an unbeaten 206 that saved Australia from defeat in the second Test, and was honoured as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} a weekend getaway, {{surgeons}} Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) and Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) {{are involved in a}} vehicular collision, moments after Robbins proposes marriage. Torres suffers severe injuries, which endanger both her life and the life of her unborn child. She and Robbins are taken to Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, the institute at which they <b>both</b> <b>work.</b> Their colleagues attempt to save Torres, while Robbins and Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), the father of Torres's baby, stand by. Torres's many injuries include neurological trauma. While barely conscious, she hallucinates an uninjured version of herself standing beside her. The hallucinatory Torres begins to sing, and is gradually joined by the doctors treating her. This singing continues throughout the episode, as Torres's projection of herself attempts to reach out to Robbins.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is a {{comparison}} of two works of German language literature of the 70 's, Verena Stefan's Hautungen and Peter Handke's die linkshandige Frau, which examines the background of <b>both</b> <b>works,</b> their themes, structure, style and language, {{as well as their}} interpretation of women's emancipation. A study of the literary background of the works will be undertaken, leading to a comparison of literary and social orientations reflected in the works. The central themes of <b>both</b> <b>works</b> will be examined in a parallel fashion to illuminate thematic similarities and differences. An interpretation of <b>both</b> <b>works</b> as women's literature and their emancipatory tendencies (conscious and unconscious) will be undertaken, to analyze the true extent of emancipatory tendencies in <b>both</b> <b>works.</b> Finally the genre, style and language of <b>both</b> <b>works</b> will be analysed, to define essential stylistic differences between the two works...|$|R

Contemporary breed standards vary depending on whether the registry is for working or show Kelpies. It is possible for a dog to <b>both</b> <b>work</b> and show, but options for competition in conformation shows might be limited depending on ancestry and the opinions of the kennel clubs or breed clubs involved.|$|E

25|$|Frank's wife Claire runs an NGO, the Clean Water Initiative, {{which she}} uses to {{cultivate}} her own power, yet its ultimate purpose remains unknown. Despite {{the success of}} the operation, Claire seeks to expand its scope to the international stage, often using Frank's connections. It is clear from the outset that Claire shares both her husband's cold-hearted, ruthless pragmatism and lust for power, and they frequently scheme together to ensure the success of each other's ventures. They <b>both</b> <b>work</b> with Remy Danton, a corporate lobbyist and former Underwood staffer, to secure funds for their operations and expand their influence.|$|E
25|$|The FCV concept {{also uses}} {{portions}} of Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive technology including the electric motor, {{power control unit}} and other parts and components from its hybrid vehicles to improve reliability and minimize cost. The hybrid technology {{is also used to}} work together with the fuel cell. At low speeds such as city driving, the FCV runs just like any all-electric car by using the energy stored in its battery, which is charged through regenerative braking. At higher speeds, the hydrogen fuel cell alone powers the electric motor. When more power is needed, for example during sudden acceleration, the battery supports the fuel cell system as <b>both</b> <b>work</b> together to provide propulsion.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{government}} also invited foreign architects to <b>both</b> <b>work</b> in Japan and teach new Japanese architects. One of these, the British architect Josiah Conder {{went on to}} train {{many of the most}} prominent of the Japanese Meiji era architects, including Kingo Tatsuno, Tatsuzō Sone and Tokuma Katayama. Tatsuno's early works had a Venetian style influenced by John Ruskin, but his later works such as the Bank of Japan (1896) and Tōkyō Station (1914) have a more Beaux-Arts feel. On the other hand, Katayama was more influenced by the French Second Empire style which {{can be seen in the}} Nara National Museum (1894) and the Kyōto National Museum (1895).|$|E

25|$|Excavations at {{this site}} also yielded a number of objects related to slave life at Poplar Forest. Archaeologists {{discovered}} iron saw files, gimlets, wedges, croze irons, and a hinge from a folding ruler; {{it is likely that}} these objects are from tools used by slaves either in their work assignments or in their personal space. Scissors, straight pins, and thimbles found at the site suggest that women sewed for <b>both</b> <b>work</b> and for their families. The excavations uncovered stoneware and earthenware that scholars believe to have been used to prepare food; enslaved men and women at Poplar Forest ate fruits and vegetables as well as beef, pork, venison, opossum, rabbit, chicken, turkey, and fish, and possibly had access to firearms with which to hunt animals.|$|E

The archive, open to scholars, contains letters, scrapbooks, bills, receipts and other ephemera. A visitor center is housed in the former carriage house, and an upstairs bedroom has been converted into the Evelyn and Maurice Sharp Gallery, which shows changing exhibitions of artwork drawn mainly from the archival collections.|$|E

Originally, another director was supposed to helm this episode, but plans fell through and Manners was hired. The production staff was initially worried about Manners, because he subscribed to the Stephen J. Cannell school of thought regarding television directing; Cannell felt that the writers and directors should <b>both</b> <b>work</b> together to cast characters, look at locations, and film the episode. This school of thought was perceived, at the time, [...] "as a lesser kind" [...] of directing, according to Morgan. However, Morgan was a proponent of Manners, and eventually secured his position for the episode.|$|E
500|$|Ho Ho Ho, {{also known}} as VH-1 Presents RuPaul: Ho Ho Ho, is a 1997 Christmas album and third overall by American singer and drag queen RuPaul. It was {{released}} on October 28, 1997 by Rhino; it is RuPaul’s first album featuring Christmas music {{and serves as a}} follow-up to Foxy Lady (1996). RuPaul co-produced the album with American music producers Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, who <b>both</b> <b>work</b> for the production company World of Wonder. Ho Ho Ho consists of ten tracks, including eleven covers of Christmas standards and carols, and three original songs written by Joe Carrano and the singer. The album was frequently referenced as an example of camp though RuPaul did specify that he recorded several more serious covers, specifically [...] "All Alone on Christmas" [...] and [...] "Hard Candy Christmas".|$|E
500|$|Stefani was {{the first}} artist Oxley wrote a song for outside of Keane, and the singer remarked that [...] "he's like Clark Kent-subtle, but Superman-talented.

[...] Oxley would later {{collaborate}} with artists like Australian singer Kylie Minogue, and in an interview he talked about working with her and Stefani, saying [...] "I've been very lucky {{to work with people}} {{at the top of the}} industry.
