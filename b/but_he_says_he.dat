500|$|In early 1975, Brando {{signed on}} as Jor-El with a salary of $3.7million and 11.75% of the box office gross profits, totaling $19million. He horrified Salkind by proposing in their first meeting that Jor-El appear as a green {{suitcase}} or a bagel with Brando's voice, but Donner used flattery to persuade the actor to portray Jor-El himself. Brando hoped {{to use some of}} his salary for a proposed 13-part Roots-style miniseries on Native Americans in the United States. Brando had it in his contract to complete all of his scenes in 12 days. He also refused to memorize his dialogue, so cue cards were compiled across the set. Fellow Oscar winner Hackman was cast as Lex Luthor days later. The filmmakers made it a priority to shoot all of Brando's and Hackman's footage [...] "because they would be committed to other films immediately." [...] Though the Salkinds felt that Puzo had written a solid story for the two-part film, they deemed his scripts too long and so hired Robert Benton and David Newman for rewrite work. Benton became too busy directing The Late Show, so David's wife Leslie was brought in to help her husband finish writing duties. George MacDonald Fraser was later hired to do some work on the script, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> did little.|$|E

He believes the meeting will be quite simple and quick, but once there he is confronted by Devon Banks (Will Arnett) who has begun working with the federal government. Devon reveals that he has spent the last year since being fired from GE in [...] "Do-Over" [...] working to get back at Jack by making connections in the Barack Obama administration through a friendship with the president's daughters, Sasha and Malia. Devon leaks Jack's controversial testimony from the hearing, believing that public pressure will force Jack to resign in three days. Jack spends that time asking the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff writers—Frank, Lutz, and James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell)—to come up with an idea [...] "as good as the light bulb" [...] to improve the microwave. They try to incorporate suggestions such as making the microwave bigger or making them break down more often so they require replacement, but Jack eventually abandons the project as a failure. However, instead of leaving GE, Jack convinces Devon to give the company bailout money (which he had previously refused), effectively making Devon Jack's boss.|$|E
