25|$|In 2003, <b>Barkan</b> et al. {{published}} several {{attacks on}} GSM encryption. The first {{is an active}} attack. GSM phones can be convinced to use the much weaker A5/2 cipher briefly. A5/2 can be broken easily, and the phone uses the same key as for the stronger A5/1 algorithm. A second attack on A5/1 is outlined, a ciphertext-only time-memory tradeoff attack which requires {{a large amount of}} precomputation.|$|E
25|$|Some attacks {{require an}} {{expensive}} preprocessing stage {{after which the}} cipher can be broken in minutes or seconds. Until recently, the weaknesses have been passive attacks using the known plaintext assumption. In 2003, more serious weaknesses were identified which can be exploited in the ciphertext-only scenario, or by an active attacker. In 2006 Elad <b>Barkan,</b> Eli Biham and Nathan Keller demonstrated attacks against A5/1, A5/3, or even GPRS that allow attackers to tap GSM mobile phone conversations and decrypt them either in real-time, or at any later time.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{less than}} 15% of Israeli wine is {{produced}} for sacramental purposes. The three largest producers—Carmel Winery, <b>Barkan</b> Wine Cellars and Golan Heights Winery—account {{for more than}} 80% of the domestic market. The United States is the largest export destination. Even though it contains only around one-quarter of the planted acreage as Lebanon, Israel {{has emerged as a}} driving force for winemaking in the Eastern Mediterranean, due to its willingness to adopt new technology and its large export market. The country has also seen the emergence of a modern wine culture with upscale restaurants featuring international wines dedicated to an ever-increasing wine-conscious clientele.|$|E
25|$|Vines {{have been}} {{planted in the}} Negev since ancient times. In modern times, {{vineyards}} have been established in the northern Negev hills using innovative computerized watering methods for irrigation. Carmel Winery {{was the first of}} the major wineries to plant vineyards in the Negev and operates a boutique winery at Ramat Arad. Tishbi has vineyards at Sde Boker and <b>Barkan</b> grows its grapes in Mitzpe Ramon. Yatir Winery is a boutique winery in Tel Arad. Its vineyards are on a hill 900 meters above sea level on the outskirts of Yatir Forest. Carmey Avdat is Israel's first solar-powered winery.|$|E
25|$|Phil and Grant {{arrive in}} Walford {{to open an}} {{automobile}} repair shop, known as The Arches. Phil later goes into partnership at The Queen Victoria public house with Grant and his wife Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), and moves in with them. Phil grows close to Sharon, who turns to him for comfort during Grant's violent outbursts. Sharon and Phil have sex but she stays with Grant, who is unaware of their betrayal. Sharon and Grant's reconciliation is brief, and amidst more rowing and physical violence, Grant is arrested and imprisoned. In his absence, Phil and Sharon continue their affair but when Grant is released, Sharon reconciles with him, leaving Phil heartbroken. On the rebound, Phil enters into a marriage of convenience with Nadia Borovac (Anna <b>Barkan),</b> a Romanian refugee, enabling her to stay in Britain, with Nadia departing after the wedding.|$|E
25|$|Bareḳet (בָּרֶקֶת = in the masoretic text) / Smaragdos (in the Septuagint) - Bareketh {{etymologically}} means ‘lightning flash’, whence shimmering or shiny. Smaragdos is cognate with Emerald, {{and literally}} means green stone, but is {{somewhat of a}} false friend as the Greek term could apply {{to a number of}} different green gems, not just the emerald in particular. Smaragdos was often used in Greek literature to refer to an intensely bright crystal found in columnar formations. Emerald in the proper sense of green beryl exists locally in Egypt. Items carved from emerald are known from as early as the 12th Dynasty, 1900s BCE, during the Bronze Age. But these emeralds are random finds, and not actively mined until the Ptolemaic period. Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemies, is famous for her love for the Egyptian emerald. Other minerals resembling emerald are heliodor (taking into account the implication of Smaragdos that it was green) and rock crystal (ignoring the literal meaning of Smaragdos, since the masoretic text doesn't appear to specify colour); there is much to be said for Smaragdos being either of those. Although “emerald” is the most common form used to describe the Hebrew word, bareḳet, in other sources (e.g. the Septuagint on Ezek. 28:13), the word bareḳet is rendered as “onyx.” Aquilas the proselyte (Onkelos), in his Aramaic translation of the Pentateuch, writes בָרקָן = <b>barḳan,</b> for this word. According to the Midrash Rabba (Numbers Rabba 2:7), the stone called bareḳet had veins or parallel bands of colours white, black and red running through it, suggesting that it may have actually been a kind of agate or onyx. This may explain why in some French translations the word is rendered as “agate.” In the South Arabian dialect spoken in Yemen during the Middle Ages, baḳarani (believed to be a corruption of <b>barḳan)</b> was an exceptionally beautiful and rare onyx stone mined on Mount Anis, in Yemen, one variety of which having a red surface with a vein of white over another of black running through it. Symmachus, an ancient Jewish translator whose Greek translation of the Pentateuch appeared in Origen's Hexapla, has also written κεραύνιος (=onyx) for the stone known in Hebrew as bareḳet in Exo. 28:17.|$|E

500|$|Elazar <b>Barkan</b> {{argues that}} by [...] "forcing an {{admission}} of war guilt at Versailles, rather than healing, the victors instigated resentment {{that contributed to the}} rise of Fascism." [...] Norman Davies wrote that the article invited Germany [...] "to accept sole guilt for the preceding war". Klaus Schwabe wrote that the article's influence went far beyond the discussion of war guilt. By [...] "refusing to acknowledge Germany's 'war guilt' the new German government implicitly exonerated the old monarchial order" [...] and more importantly failed [...] "to dissociate itself from the old regime." [...] In doing so [...] "it undermined its claim that post-revolutionary Germany was a historic new democratic beginning deserving credit at the peace conference." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{reception}} of the film, however, was much more positive, in particular by reviewers for horror outlets. Michael Gingold of Fangoria gave it two-and-half out of four skulls, while Jonathan <b>Barkan</b> of Bloody Disgusting gave it {{four out of five}} skulls, stating it [...] "isn’t a movie meant to scare or make you think but {{it is one of the}} most entertaining and enjoyable movies of its kind that I’ve seen in years." [...] Scott Weinberg of FEARnet wrote that [...] "aside from some very clunky editorial missteps in the film's second half, there's a good deal of wit, enthusiasm, energy, and amusing attitude to be found in the dumb-yet-self-aware Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," [...] all while noting that he is [...] "not the type to act snobbish around a ridiculous film that obviously knows it's ridiculous." [...] According to Ryan Larson of Shock Till You Drop, the film [...] "is a mixed bag" [...] but [...] "fortunately, the lows don’t appear as often as you would think," [...] and, [...] "if taken at face value, Hansel & Gretel is well worth the view." [...] William Bibbiani of CraveOnline, who criticized the film's inadequately [...] "limp" [...] marketing campaign, found the movie itself [...] "inherently stupid" [...] but in a good way, [...] "played with humor, ultraviolence and anachronistic fetish." [...] Cinema Blend's Sean O'Connell stated that the film is [...] "often mean and nasty, but that's really its saving grace." [...] Peter Paras of E! recommended this [...] "super violent, pretty funny flick" [...] for how it [...] "revels in the mayhem". Tom Russo of The Boston Globe, giving the film three out of five stars, called it a [...] "splattery fanboy fun. Preposterous, clearly, but fun." [...] Jonathon Natsis of Filmink wrote: [...] "Hansel and Gretel is not a 'film'. It's a 'movie', in all its unabashed, excitable glory...big on blood-soaked entertainment and low on pretension." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave it four out of five stars, stating: [...] "This has all the elements of a classic action flick, and it's destined for cult status. Welcome to the most fun movie of 2013." [...] DVD Talk's Jamie S. Rich summed up: [...] "Is Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters a good movie? Probably not. At least not in any way that is defensible by regular critical standards. Is it a hell of a good time? Absolutely so. Unabashedly so. That's all it wants to be." ...|$|E

[...] IGN writer Chad Grischow wrote, [...] "Though far from their best work, Limp Bizkit's latest at least proves that their 2005 Greatest Hitz album may have been premature." [...] About.com writer Tim Grierson called Gold Cobra [...] "the group’s strongest since Significant Other".|$|E

2500|$|The philosopher Martha Nussbaum {{reviewed}} One Hundred Years of Homosexuality positively in The Times Literary Supplement. The gay writer Neil Miller commended Halperin's {{book for}} its lucidity, while English professor Leonard <b>Barkan</b> called it [...] "brilliant". One Hundred Years of Homosexuality received a negative review from the critic Camille Paglia, who {{accused him of}} poor scholarship, careerism, and over-valuing Foucault's ideas. Paglia found the work pretentious and confused, and expressed her dismay at Nussbaum's positive review. Paglia criticized Halperin for implying that homosexuals and homosexuality did not exist until the word [...] "homosexuality" [...] was coined and for drawing conclusions about the views of classical Athenians based on Aristophanes' speech in Plato's Symposium, noting that [...] "Aristophanes is a literary characters and not the real-life man on which he was based". Paglia contrasted Halperin's book unfavorably with John J. Winkler's The Constraints of Desire (1990), though she also criticized Winkler.|$|E

Phil proposes to Kathy and she accepts, but during their engagement party, Kathy learns that Phil had resumed an affair with his sister-in-law Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) after Grant (Ross Kemp) obtained a tape of a drunken Sharon and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), Kathy's niece, discuss the affair. After Grant plays the tape, the revelation ends Kathy's friendship with Sharon, leads to Phil being beaten by his brother Grant, and almost ends Kathy and Phil's relationship. It also causes a strain between Kathy and Michelle and Kathy is hurt about Michelle taking Sharon's side, believing that as family, Michelle should have told her. Kathy is cold towards Michelle's initial efforts to make amends, but they soon make up.|$|E
