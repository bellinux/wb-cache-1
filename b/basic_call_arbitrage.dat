50|$|In {{a bespoke}} {{portfolio}} transaction, the investor chooses or agrees {{to the list}} of reference entities, the rating of the tranche, maturity of the transaction, coupon type (fixed or floating), subordination level, type of collateral assets used etc. Typically the objective is to create a debt instrument where the return is significantly higher than comparably rated bonds. In a nutshell, a single-tranche CDO is a CDO where the arranging bank does not simultaneously place the entirety of the capital structure. These CDOs are also <b>called</b> <b>arbitrage</b> CDOs because the arranging bank seeks to pay a lower return than the return available from hedging the single-tranche exposure.|$|R

40|$|A {{derivative}} {{security is}} a financial contract contingent {{on the price of}} an underlying asset. For example, options to buy or sell a commodity are derivatives. The pricing of such contracts is the purview of Derivative Pricing Theory. The practice of derivative pricing theory has historically relied {{on the assumption that the}} market is free of opportunities for arbitrage. This assumption is known as information efficiency and this branch of derivative pricing is <b>called</b> <b>Arbitrage</b> Pricing Theory (APT). The essential goal of APT is to establish a fair price for a contract, i. e. such a price that does not disturb the existing equilibrium in the market. Under ATP, all market participants are modeled the same way, with each having equal powers, and being subject to the same constraints. This is an idealized setting. For example, airline companies and oil refineries both come to the market to trade in fuel, but they do so with fundamentally different perspectives, one of them being [...] ...|$|R

The choice of S reflects into the intrinsic properties of the class of polar sets of martingale measures. In particular: for S=Ω absence of Model Independent Arbitrage is equivalent to the existence of a martingale measure; for S being the open sets, absence of Open Arbitrage is equivalent to the existence of full support martingale measures. These results are obtained by adopting a technical filtration enlargement and by constructing a universal aggregator of all arbitrage opportunities. We further introduce the notion of market feasibility and provide its characterization via arbitrage conditions. We conclude providing a dual representation of Open Arbitrage in terms of weakly open sets of probability measures, which highlights the robust nature of this concept...|$|R
