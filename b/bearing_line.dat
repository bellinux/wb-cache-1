The modes of support and of decoration are infinitely various, but the real character of the building, in all good Gothic, depends upon the single lines of the gable over the pointed arch, Fig. IX., endlessly rearranged or repeated. The larger woodcut, Fig. X., represents three characteristic conditions of the treatment of the group: a, from a tomb at Verona (1328); b, one of the lateral porches at Abbeville; c, one of the uppermost points of the great western façade of Rouen Cathedral; both these last being, I believe, early work of the fifteenth century. The forms of the pure early English and French Gothic are too well known to need any notice; my reason will appear presently for choosing, by way of example, these somewhat rare conditions.|$|E

For these applications, QKCs require fewer parts, have a lower total cost, and provide sub-micron repeatability. This paper covers design and manufacturing considerations for automotive QKCs.

40|$|BACKGROUND Osteoarthritis {{commonly}} {{affects the}} medial compartment of knee {{giving rise to}} varus deformity in majority of cases. Significant varus deformity further aggravates the pathology due to medialisation of the weight <b>bearing</b> <b>line</b> osteotomy of the proximal tibia realigns this weight bearing axis, thereby relieving pressure on the damaged medial compartment. OWHTO is a promising option in this scenario because it is associated with high accuracy in correcting the deformity and less number of complications when compared to lateral closing wedge HTO or UKA. In this study, we evaluate the functional outcome of HTO in patients with unicompartmental osteoarthritis.

40|$|Background. It {{is unclear}} whether {{computer}} navigation can improve the accuracy and reliability of targeted lower limb alignment correction following open-wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO). This meta-analysis was designed to compare the accuracy and reliability of limb alignment correction between computer navigated and conventional open-wedge HTOs. Methods. Studies that compared postoperative coronal alignment, including mechanical axis (MA) and weight <b>bearing</b> <b>line</b> (WBL) ratio, outliers of alignment correction, and change in tibial posterior slope, following open-wedge HTO performed using computer navigated and conventional methods were included. Results. Ten studies {{were included in the}} meta-analysis. The MA (0. 93 °; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 45 – 1. 41 °; P< 0. 001) and WBL ratio (1. 5 %; 95 % CI: 0. 03 – 2. 98 %; P= 0. 048) were significantly greater for computer navigated HTO than for conventional HTO. Outliers of alignment correction after surgery were significantly lower in patients who underwent computer navigated HTO than in those who underwent conventional HTO (odds ratio: 0. 25; 95 % CI: 0. 08 – 0. 79; P= 0. 02). Changes in posterior tibial slope from before to after surgery, however, were similar for the two approaches. Conclusion. Computer navigated HTO resulted in slightly more valgus postoperative alignment and effectively reduced outliers of alignment correction but had no effect on change in posterior tibial slope when compared with conventional HTO...|$|E

What influence generated by the results acting on the actual use of performance is still not clear. To this end, this article studied the influence generated by the angle of surface S tangent of coupler-knuckle on coupling connection contour and starting <b>bearing</b> <b>line</b> (referred to as surface S angle) to traction reliability, coupling feasibility and acting force in tangent line, systematically. And authors explored the value ranges of surface S angle {{in order to ensure}} the operation performance of coupler-knuckle. Firstly, find the major factors which are associated to surface S angle by studying the movement mechanism of coupling and traction. For example, the maximum level angle of coupler-knuckles, the ability for vehicle to pass the curves, etc. And then, get analytical expression of coupler surface S angle and related factors by means of theoretical derivation. After that, obtain value ranges of surface S angle. Finally, carry on experiments with multi-body dynamics simulation software RecurDyn. On the one hand, eliminate unreasonable value ranges obtained by theoretical derive, on the other hand, analyze the changing rule of the acting force on coupler-knuckle contour. The results prove that, when coupler surface S angle is 30 °, the traction performance of coupler is relatively stable, the coupling performance is relatively reliable, the contact force on coupler-knuckle contour is smaller. The conclusion is consistent with surface S angle parameter required by the standard system of Association of American Railroads. The research results above provided the theoretical basis for improving coupler’s manufacturability...|$|E
40|$|Fatigue {{lives of}} rolling element {{bearings}} exhibit a wide scatter {{due to the}} statistical nature of the rolling contact fatigue failure process. One of the primary reasons for dispersion in lives is the stochastic nature of the bearing material. In this thesis, a damage mechanics based fatigue model is introduced {{in conjunction with the}} idea of discrete material representation that takes the effect of material microstructure explicitly into account. Two sources of material randomness are considered: (1) the topological randomness due to geometric variability in the material microstructure; and (2) the material property randomness due to non-uniform distribution of properties throughout the material. The effect of these variations on the sub-surface stress fields in rolling element line contacts is studied. The damage model which incorporates cyclic damage accumulation and progressive degradation of material properties with rolling contact cycling is then used to study the mechanisms of sub-surface initiated spalling in <b>bearing</b> <b>line</b> contacts. Crack initiation as well as propagation stages are modeled using damaged material zones in a unified framework. The spalling phenomenon is found to occur through micro-crack initiation below the surface where multiple micro-cracks coalesce and subsequent cracks propagate to the surface. The computed crack trajectories and spall profiles are found to be consistent with experimental observations. The micro-crack initiation phase is found to be {{only a small fraction of}} the total spalling life and the scatter in total life is primarily governed by the scatter in the propagation phase of the cracks through the microstructure. Spalling lives are found to follow a 3 -parameter Weibull distribution more closely compared to the conventionally used 2 -parameter Weibull distribution. Spalling lives are found to follow an inverse power law relationship with respect to the contact pressure. Based on the spalling life distributions and stress-life results, a new life equation for subsurface initiated spalling in bearing contacts is formulated. ...|$|E
40|$|Fire was a {{controlling}} {{force in the}} Iowa landscape long before Euro-Americans took up residence among its forests and prairies (Anderson 1998). Rivers and river valleys are features that influenced the spread of these fires (Leitner and others 1991, Anderson 1998). Based on previous studies in the midwest, the primary wind direction during fire season was {{from the south and}} west (Leitner and others 1991, Anderson 1998). As fire spread, river valleys acted as fire breaks and decreased fire frequency and intensity in protected areas to the north and east (Leitner and others 1991). In this study several spatial and statistical measures were used to examine evidence for this view of the spatial relationships between rivers, landforms, and fire within Polk and Dallas Counties, Iowa. Mean direction and distance to General Land Office (GLO) timber on both the north/east (protected) and south/west (exposed) sides of rivers was calculated using Euclidian distance and direction functions in ArcGIS. Timber was determined to be present in larger quantities in the protected zone in Polk County, and in the exposed zone in Dallas County. Timber was also determined to be farther away from GLO rivers on average, in exposed zones in both counties. These results do not support the hypothesis that timber was present in greater quantities and was further away from GLO rivers to the north and east, and demonstrate the need for research in additional areas. GLO tree species composition (witness, <b>bearing,</b> <b>line,</b> and meander trees) was also analyzed to determine if edaphic and vegetative factors including soil characteristics, slope, and GLO vegetation type were similar on both sides of GLO rivers. Based on this analysis, it does not appear that edaphic factors are different on protected and exposed sides of GLO rivers, so they do not provide an explanation for differences in tree species distribution. Importance values were calculated for each species within each zone by summing relative density and relative dominance values (Bolliger and others 2004). In the protected zone, species with the highest importance values included White Oak, Elm, and Burr Oak. In the exposed zone, species with the highest importance values included Burr Oak, White Oak, and Elm. For trees lacking genus or species identifiers, edaphic and vegetative factors were analyzed to determine a likely genus or species. Results of this analysis for 37 trees identified only as `maple 2 ̆ 7 resulted in 26 trees designated as Silver Maple, and 11 trees identified as Sugar Maple. For two trees identified only as `Black 2 ̆ 7, one was identified as Black Walnut, and one was identified as Black Oak. For the 35 trees identified only as Ash, 26 were identified as Green Ash, and 9 were identified as White Ash. Future research should include the expansion of this study to additional parts of Iowa, analyzing species composition based on fire tolerance, and measuring the statistical significance of differences in composition in protected and exposed zones...|$|E

40|$|Fatigue {{initiation}} {{and subsequent}} {{short and long}} crack growth has been investigated in an typical automotive bearing system, focussing on the behaviour of the aluminium-tin-silicon lining material.
