40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the development of}} collocational knowledge in learners of ESL. A number of previous studies have underscored the importance of collocations for L 2 acquisition, and the problems that learners face with learning and using collocations. However, {{there have been few}} attempts to systematically study how the development of collocational knowledge relates to the overall development of language proficiency with a particular intention in identifying possible stages in the development of L 2 collocational knowledge. This study adopts a structure-based framework for the study of collocations based on previous studies (Zhang 1993; Biscup 1992) and the BBI Combinatory Dictionary of English, and attempts to describe how collocational knowledge develops across different language proficiency levels with respect to 37 collocation types. Data were collected from 275 Greek learners of ESL at three proficiency levels (post-beginners, intermediate, and post-intermediate) using three tasks: essay writing, translation test, and <b>blank-filling.</b> The essay writing provided evidence of accurate free production of collocations, while the translation and <b>blank-filling</b> tests measured accuracy in the subjects’ knowledge of collocations in cued production tasks. The data were examined with respect to the between- and within-group differences in accuracy on all three dependent measures. Statistical measures were employed to determine the significance of the observed between-group and within-group differences, and implicational scaling analyses was used to reveal accuracy orders in the acquisition of collocations. Results show that there are patterns of development of collocational knowledge across and within the different proficiency groups for both the free and the cued production data. Collocational knowledge was shown to increase steadily as the level of proficiency increased, and there were group-specific accuracy orders showing that grammatical collocations are easier to acquire than lexical collocations. The development of collocational knowledge was found to be influenced by the syntactic complexity of the collocation types, and also by exposure and maturation. Finally, three stages for the development of collocational knowledge are proposed. In the first stage learners acquire collocations as unanalysed lexical items, and hence the learners are more accurate with lexical collocations than complex grammatical ones. At the second stage the learners 2 ̆ 7 grammatical knowledge develops enabling learners to use complex grammatical collocations with greater accuracy than in stage one. At the third stage of collocational development, learners are able to use both grammatical and lexical collocations with greater accuracy than in the other two stages, and they {{are on their way to}} a more advanced level of collocational knowledge. Pedagogical implications and directions for future research are provided in light of the research findings...|$|E

O razvoju se kolokacijske kompetencije u hrvatskom kao inom jeziku (HIJ) još uvijek nedovoljno zna (Burić i Lasić, 2012; Petrović, 2007;), dok je o imenskim kolokacijama u hrvatskom kao materinskom jeziku najiscrpniji opis dosada ponudila Blagus Bartolec (2014). Cilj je ovoga istraživanja bio ispitati receptivno i produktivno znanje imenskih kolokacija s obzirom na čestotu (viša, niža) i snagu kolokacijskih sastavnica (jaka, slaba) s obzirom na razinu poznavanja HIJ-a (viša i niža razina) te dobiti uvid u vrste odgovora u odabiru ciljane kolokacije. Istraživanje je kolokacijske kompetencije u HIJ-u provedeno na osnovnom tipu kolokacija prema Blagus Bartolec (2014) pri čemu je osnova imenica, a kolokat pridjev. Prije same je izrade instrumenta (zadatak višestrukoga izbora, zadaci popunjavanja praznina s kolokacijama u nominativu, kosim padežima i širem kontekstu) bilo potrebno provesti i dva predistraživanja, odnosno korpusno istraživanje kolokacija u dvama korpusima (CROLTEC i hrWaC) te procjenu asocijativne snage kolokacijskih sastavnica s izvornim govornicima hrvatskoga jezika (HJ). Rezultati pokazuju da ispitanici više razine imaju bolje receptivno znanje imenskih kolokacija više čestote od ispitanika niže razine HIJ-a. U zadacima produktivne razine, niža je razina pokazala slabo razvijenu kolokacijsku, ali i gramatičku kompetenciju za što se razlozi mogu pronaći u morfološkoj složenosti HJ-a, izloženosti jeziku te strukturnim i semantičkim obilježjima kolokacija. Viša razina znanja HIJ-a pokazala je podjednako znanje kolokacija u nominativu i kosim padežima, što znači da morfološka obilježja nisu imala utjecaj na znanje kolokacija. Kolokacijska je kompetencija na ovoj razina bolje razvijena u odnosu na nižu razinu znanja HIJ-a. Analiza vrsta odgovora pokazala je da su na receptivnoj razini prevladali tvorbeni distraktori, što ukazuje na morfološku osviještenost ispitanika. Najzastupljenijom vrstom odgovora na produktivnoj razini pokazali su se kolokati izvan konteksta (KIK), što pokazuje da su ispitanici u mogućnosti tvoriti različite vrste leksičkih sveza pomoću usvojenih leksičkih jedinica s ciljem konkretizacije značenja. Even though {{syntagmatic}} {{relations were}} {{the subject of}} linguistic research {{since the beginning of}} the 20 th century, a comprehensive investigation of collocations started only in the 1950 s, primarily thanks to John Rupert Firth (1957). Firth was the first to use the term collocation in lexical semantic discussions; however, up until this day there is no clear and unambiguous definition of this lexical semantic phenomenon. The term collocation (Latin com together + locare situate) is usually defined as a co-occurrence of individual lexical items at the syntagmatic level. There are many attempts to define collocations in relevant literature. For example, Nation (2001 : 516) mentions a group of words that belong together, either because, they commonly occur together, like take a chance, or because their meaning is not obvious from the meaning of their parts, as with by the way. Lewis (2000) draws attention to the natural co-occurrence of two words, therefore emphasising that not any two words that co-occur in a text should be understood as a collocation. Apart from these definitions, there are different approaches to studying collocations in relevant works; namely, the lexical composition approach (Firth, 1957; Halliday, 1966; Sinclair, 1966), the semantic approach (Mel'čuk, 2008; Katz & Fodor, 1963; Cruse, 1986) and the structural approach (Matthews, 1964; Mitchell, 1971; Greenbaum, 1974). Representatives of the lexical composition school of thought consider lexis an autonomous entity separate from grammar, and therefore define collocations as a manner in which the lexical meaning is realised, arising from the habitual co-occurrence of two lexemes along the syntagmatic axis (Firth, 1957). The semantic approach aims to predict the collocational span of a specific lexical unit by reference to its semantic features. The structural approach, on the other hand, argues for the unity of lexis and grammar and tries to establish the collocational structure. However, due to different definitions and theoretical approaches to the study of collocations, there are still no universal criteria that would clarify why certain lexical units collocate, how the meaning of the collocation is achieved, and how to differentiate collocations from other lexical combinations, especially phrasemes and free lexical combinations. Apart from theoretical linguistics, collocations have also been studied within Second Language Acquisition (SLA). In the late 1990 s, Hill (1999, as cited in Martyńska 2004) introduced the notion of collocational competence, thus moving the focus from teaching individual lexical items to developing collocational competence. Even though many experts argue that collocations are a neglected area of lexical competence (Gitsaki, 1999; Koya, 2003; Martyńska, 2004), so far the most extensive research has been done on collocations in English as a Second Language (ESL). It is believed that the development of general vocabulary increases the productive and receptive collocational knowledge, which has been confirmed in research for English (Koya, 2003; Gitsaki 1999) and Italian as L 2 (Bonci, 2002). Furthermore, collocational usage can be a clear indicator for differentiation of lower and higher proficiency levels of non-native speakers. Students on higher levels of ESL use more complex types of collocational structures compared to students on lower levels, who mostly rely on frequent collocations consisting of nouns, adjectives, and verbs (Gitsaki, 1999; Zhang 1993). The reasons for this could be found in the exposure to collocations, differences in the first language, the structural and semantic complexity of collocational types, but also in the educational context, i. e. the exposure to different collocational types in the studying process (Begagić, 2104; Gitsaki, 1999;). In Croatian, the situation is somewhat different. The largest number of research on collocations in Croatian linguistics is concerned with lexicographical processing of collocations, since a Croatian collocation dictionary still does not exist. The most detailed description of noun collocations in Croatian as first language so far was given by Blagus Bartolec (2014), but research work on collocational competence in Croatian as a Second Language (CSL) is sporadic (Petrović, 2007; Burić and Lasić, 2012). More extensive research on collocation acquisition in CSL does not exist, whereas only Udier (2015) discusses collocational competence in the Framework of Reference for B 2 Croatian, within grammatical competence. The lack of research on collocational competence of non-native speakers of Croatian and the assumption that morphological features of words can affect collocational knowledge were enough motivation for this research. This thesis consists of two main parts. The theoretical part discusses approaches to teaching collocations, lexical combinations, and collocational competence in second language. The practical part presents a research on collocational competence in CSL, which was preceded by two pre-researches; the evaluation of the associative power of collocations with native speakers and a corpus analysis of collocations. These are followed by a discussion and a conclusion. Firstly, it is necessary to define collocations and go back to the criteria for differentiating collocations from other lexical combinations in Croatian (phrasemes, multi-word lexical units, names, and free lexical combinations). WORD COMBINATIONS In Croatian, there are three types of fixed lexical combinations: phrasemes, terms, and names (onemes), and Turk (2000) draws attention to their similarities and differences. She mentions the complex structure, semantic transformation of at least one element, and productivity as similarities, and stability, connotative power, and idiomaticity as differences. Another important feature that Turk (2000) emphasises in differentiating mentioned lexical combinations is their communicative function. Phrasemes are seen as expressions of secondary nomination which indicate personal, emotive attitudes, and opinions; terms are used for communicating and defining concepts amongst experts in a scientific or professional area; whereas the primary role of names (onemes) is to identify objects. The discussion about lexical combinations would not be complete without mentioning free combinations, since together with phrasemes, they represent the largest stumbling block for linguists to clearly define collocations. Free combinations are those combinations of words that are characterized by many possibilities of combining and exchanging elements, and therefore, a lower possibility of co-occurrence (Petrović, 2007; Borić, 2002, 1996; Pritchard, 1998;). In this thesis, the difference between collocations and free combinations is set by taking into consideration the freedom of combining lexical units and the semantic criterion. Those lexical items whose elements can be combined with other lexical units without limits are considered as free lexical combinations. However, collocations are lexical combinations that arise from the syntagmatisation process, where assimilation or change in meaning of individual elements causes the creation of a new collocational meaning. The most complete definition of collocations in Croatian was given by Blagus Bartolec (2014 : 80), who argues that a collocation is a „special lexical combination at the syntagmatic level based on semantic connectedness of individual lexical units, which specifies their meanings”. This definition needs further explanation. Blagus Bartolec (2014) limits collocations to two content words that formally denote a syntagm. The communicative function of language is especially important here, i. e. the usage among native and non-native speakers, which makes collocations a special type, different from other types of lexical combinations. To understand the difference between collocations and other lexical combinations, it is important to mention their semantic features. Therefore, it is should be mentioned that collocations in Croatian arise from the process of syntagmatisation, which means that they do not have a status of lexical units. This is due to the semantic adaptation arising from the semantic potential of the second word that enters into the collocational relation. Because of the semantic potential of the components, one component is modified by the other and a new, collocational meaning appears, which is “motivated by the extralinguistic phenomenon that is being referred to (sunny / rainy day, long / short hair; new / used car) ” (Blagus Bartolec, 2014 : 85). Additionally, the meaning is specified, i. e. narrowed down to a specific communicative situation. In this thesis, the above mentioned definition by Blagus Bartolec (2014) is accepted. However, since collocations have never been studied in the context of CSL, this research deals only with basic collocations having nouns as bases and adjectives as their collocators. Semantically, the basic collocational type refers to “the basic level of primary meaning specification” (Blagus Bartolec, 2014 : 92). The division into base and collocator allows us to perform a corpus analysis of these types of collocations, which was done in this thesis. Furthermore, previous research has shown (Burić and Lasić, 2012; Duplančić Rogošić, 2007) that Noun+Verb is the most common collocational type in Croatian. RESEARCH PROBLEMS AND HYPOTHESES The main goal of this thesis is to examine the knowledge of noun collocations based on their frequency and collocational strength, and considering the CSL proficiency level. There are several specific research questions and hypotheses: Q 1. To examine the receptive collocational knowledge considering the frequency of collocations and CSL proficiency level. H 1. Subjects of higher CSL proficiency will have a better receptive knowledge than subjects of lower CSL proficiency. Q 2. To examine the productive knowledge of noun collocations considering the associative strength of collocational elements and the frequency of collocations for both morphologically unmarked collocations in the nominative case and morphologically marked collocations in oblique cases considering the CSL proficiency level. H 2 a. Subjects of lower CSL proficiency will have more correct answers for morphologically unmarked collocations in the nominative case compared to morphologically marked collocations in oblique cases. H 2 b. Subjects of higher CSL proficiency will have an equal knowledge of morphologically unmarked collocations in the nominative case and morphologically marked collocations in oblique cases. Q 3. To examine the productive knowledge of noun collocations considering the associative strength of collocational elements, the frequency of collocations in a wider context, and the CSL proficiency level. H 3. Subjects of higher CSL proficiency will have more correct answers than subjects of lower CSL proficiency. Q 4. To examine the answer types in receptive knowledge tasks about noun collocations considering their frequency and subjects’ CSL proficiency level. Q 5. To examine the answer types in receptive knowledge tasks about noun collocations considering their frequency, associative strength, and subjects’ CSL proficiency level. For this research it was necessary to collect several hundreds of collocations that represented a working corpus and were used to create the research instruments. Collocations were collected from essays written by students of Language exercises in Croatian as L 2 on levels B 1 and B 2. The validity of collected collocations was verified in the Large dictionary of Croatian language (Anić, 2003) and the hrWaC corpus (Ljubešić and Erjavec, 2011), which was also used to count the frequency of collocations. Finally, the associative strength of collocational elements was assessed by native speakers of Croatian. Based on their frequency and associative strength, collocations were divided into two groups: those of lower (LF) and higher frequency (HF) and those of weak and strong associative strength. The sample comprised of 70 students of Language exercises in Croatian as L 2 on B 1, B 1 +, B 2, B 2 + and C 1 levels. The sample structure is very heterogeneous and implies a diverse representation of gender, language (pre) knowledge levels, and first languages. INSTRUMENTS 1. THE EVALUATION OF COLLOCATIONAL ASSOCIATIVE STRENGTH In order to determine the associative strength between collocational elements, an assessment was made on a sample of about 50 native speakers of Croatian. Subjects estimated the strength of association between collocational elements on a scale from 1 to 5. After the evaluation of the associative strength, descriptive data (M, SD) that represent the average associative strength was calculated for each collocation. 2. MULTIPLE CHOICE TEST In order to examine the receptive knowledge of collocations in CSL, subjects completed a multiple choice task (Task B) that consisted of 16 sentences. Each sentence, apart from the correct answer, had three distractors. Distractors comprised false pairs from subjects’ first languages (English, Polish, Spanish, and German) and Croatian adjectives of similar formation. 3. <b>BLANK-FILLING</b> TESTS In order to examine the influence of morphological features on collocational knowledge, subjects completed two <b>blank-filling</b> tasks that comprised forty isolated sentences, i. e. sentences without a wider context. In the first task, collocations were in nominative (Task A), i. e. the unmarked case, whereas in the second task (Task D), sentences were in oblique cases. In the third part of the test subjects solved a task in which collocations were put into more informative, wider contexts (Task C). General distribution of collocations in the instruments comprised an even number of collocations considering the frequency and associative strength of collocational elements. In every task, the collocation base was given (a noun) and subjects showed their receptive and productive knowledge of the collocator (adjective). The results were analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively (answer type typology for collocator choice). Statistica analytic package was used to analyse the results. RESULT ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION The answer type analysis will be presented first, followed by the response accuracy analysis for receptive and productive tasks on lower and higher CSL proficiency. ANSWER TYPE ANALYSIS OF THE RECEPTIVE LEVEL TASKS As expected, the percentage of correct answers was higher at a higher CSL proficiency level for both collocation types considering their frequency (80...|$|E
