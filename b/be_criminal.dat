Since the act is widely considered to <b>be</b> <b>criminal</b> by the Vulcan authorities, Soval is summarily dismissed from the Ambassadorial service. Meanwhile, Captain Archer and Commander T'Pol are questioned by the Syrrannites. After a short while, T'Pol is taken to see her mother, T'Les, and the two disagree about the tenets of the group — the Vulcan authorities call them extremists, a term T'Les disagrees with. Soon, Archer begins to see visions of an old Vulcan, and the dissidents determine {{that he had the}} katra of Surak transferred into him via mind meld.|$|E
5|$|The SS was the {{organization}} {{most responsible for}} the genocidal killing of an estimated 5.5 to 6 million Jews and millions of other victims in the Holocaust. Members of all of its branches committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during World War II (1939–45). The SS was also involved in commercial enterprises and exploited concentration camp inmates as slave labor. After Nazi Germany's defeat, the SS and the NSDAP were judged by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg to <b>be</b> <b>criminal</b> organizations. Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief, {{was found guilty of}} crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials and hanged in 1946.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the state, federal {{agencies}} which allow alcohol sales {{do not have}} a system of liquor licenses or alcoholic beverage control boards, but instead simply award contracts to business per federal procurement laws. New Jersey does not consider municipal ordinances to <b>be</b> <b>criminal</b> offenses, and so open container laws cannot be enforced in federal enclaves under the Assimilative Crimes Act. Public consumption of alcohol is allowed on federal lands, except when in an automobile, or when the park superintendent has prohibited open containers in an area. For example, it is legal to consume alcoholic beverages on the beach at Sandy Hook.|$|E

25|$|According to Zbigniew Dumienski, {{the very}} concept of human {{trafficking}} is murky and misleading. It has been argued that while human trafficking is commonly seen as a monolithic crime, in reality it is an act of illegal migration that involves various different actions: some of them may <b>be</b> <b>criminal</b> or abusive, but others often involve consent and are legal. Laura Agustin argues that not everything that might seem abusive or coercive is considered as such by the migrant. For instance, she states that: 'would-be travellers commonly seek help from intermediaries who sell information, services and documents. When travellers cannot afford to buy these outright, they go into debt'. Dumienski says that while these debts might indeed be on very harsh conditions, they are usually incurred on a voluntary basis.|$|E

500|$|The Court of Appeal {{considers}} incitement {{to consist}} of {{a situation in which}} a defendant [...] "incites another to do or cause to be done an act or acts which, if done, will involve the commission of the offence or offences by the other; and he intends or believes that the other, if he acts as incited, shall or will do so with the fault required for the offence or offences". Unlike attempts, incitement is a common law offence. Incitement has a particularly broad actus reus; it has been interpreted to include [...] "a suggestion, proposal, request, exhortation, gesture, argument, persuasion, inducement, goading or the arousal of cupidity". While it must include an act of incitement, this can be both express and implied. For an offence to be committed, the incited act must <b>be</b> <b>criminal</b> in nature, and an offence not only for the person doing the incitement but the person incited. Some exceptions are made; under section 5(7) of the Criminal Law Act 1977, incitement to conspire is not an offence, and incitement to an aid or attempt are similarly not specifically given as criminal acts. In terms of mens rea, the defendant must have intended the incited offence to be committed, and also be aware of the likely consequences. It has been suggested that intent should not be necessary; if the defendant knew that his advice would be followed, and this would result in a crime, he should be found guilty.|$|E
500|$|Manstein {{was moved}} to Nuremberg in October 1945. He {{was held at the}} Palace of Justice, the {{location}} of the Nuremberg Trials of major Nazi war criminals and organisations. While there, Manstein helped prepare a 132-page document for the defence of the General Staff and the OKW, on trial at Nuremberg in August 1946. The myth that the Wehrmacht was [...] "clean"—not culpable for the events of the Holocaust—arose {{partly as a result of}} this document, written largely by Manstein, along with General of Cavalry Siegfried Westphal. He also gave oral testimony about the Einsatzgruppen, the treatment of prisoners of war, and the concept of military obedience, especially as related to the Commissar Order, an order issued by Hitler in 1941, requiring all Soviet political commissars to be shot without trial. Manstein admitted that he received the order, but said he did not carry it out. Documents from 1941 presented at Nuremberg and at Manstein's own later trial contradict this claim: He actually received regular reports throughout that summer regarding the execution of hundreds of political commissars. He denied any knowledge of the activities of the Einsatzgruppen, and testified that soldiers under his command were not involved in the murder of Jewish civilians. Otto Ohlendorf, commander of Einsatzgruppe D, contradicted this during his testimony, saying that not only was Manstein aware of what was happening but that the Eleventh Army was involved. In September 1946, the General Staff and the OKW were declared to not <b>be</b> <b>criminal</b> organisations.|$|E
500|$|After impressing {{during his}} loan spell at Cheltenham, Myrie-Williams joined League One rivals Tranmere Rovers on a month's loan. On {{bringing}} Myrie-Williams to the club, Tranmere manager Ronnie Moore stated [...] "He is left footed and will bring balance to our side". He made his debut for Tranmere two days later, {{starting in the}} club's 1–0 home defeat to eventual champions Swansea City. He was given permission to play in Tranmere's FA Cup tie against Bradford City on 1 December 2007, but he was an unused substitute in the match. Myrie-Williams {{played a key role}} in Tranmere's 3–1 home win against Bournemouth a week later, winning a penalty that was duly converted by Chris Greenacre. His loan spell was extended for a further month on 19 December 2007, after Myrie-Williams had impressed manager Ronnie Moore during his four weeks with the club. He provided the assist for Paul McLaren's goal in a 2–0 home win over Carlisle United on 26 December 2007. Myrie-Williams scored his first goal for Tranmere on 26 January 2008, scoring the winner from the penalty spot in a 2–1 win against Yeovil Town at Prenton Park. Two days after scoring his first goal for the club, his loan spell was extended until the end of the 2007–08 season. Both managers were [...] "delighted" [...] with the progress Myrie-Williams was making at Tranmere, with Bristol City manager Gary Johnson adding [...] "Jennison's developing well at Tranmere and it would <b>be</b> <b>criminal</b> to bring him back now". He scored his second goal for Tranmere just five days later in a 2–0 away win at Leeds United— Myrie-Williams scored with an [...] "angled shot" [...] in the 61st minute to give Tranmere their fourth consecutive victory. Myrie-Williams was also fouled in the area in a game against Port Vale, with Chris Greenacre scoring the resulting spot kick to give Tranmere the lead in an eventual 2–0 win. He scored his third goal of the camapign on 5 April 2008, netting with a header from Andrew Taylor's cross in the third minute to give Tranmere the lead away at Walsall. However, he was taken off after 55 minutes with an injury that ruled him out for the rest of the campaign. He returned to Bristol City, having scored three goals in 26 appearance for Tranmere.|$|E
