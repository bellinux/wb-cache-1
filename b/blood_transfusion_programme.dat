A rigorous process to assess the suitability of prospective donors is therefore essential to protect the safety and sufficiency of the blood supply, and safeguard the health of recipients of <b>transfusion</b> and <b>blood</b> donors themselves, while ensuring that suitable donors are not deferred unnecessarily.

In this case report, we review the anaesthetic implications and outcome of the first two paediatric patients with SCD to have a laparoscopic splenectomy due to repeated splenic infarcts in the Republic of Ireland. Case Report A 4 year old Nigerian girl who was referred from the haematology service was diagnosed with SCD at the age of 7 months. She never received any blood transfusions and was commenced on penicillin and folic acid at the age of 2 years. All vaccines were up to date. At presentation, her baseline Hb was 8. 0 g/dL, her HbF 15. 4 %, WCC 16. 7, platelet count 179 and LDH 973. There was no icterus and abdominal examination revealed a spleen measuring 3. 5 cm. She presented to A&E 5 months after initial review with a 3 day history of a sore throat and fever, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly and enlarged tonsils. She was diagnosed with acute exudative tonsillitis and acute splenic sequestration, admitted to hospital and commenced on intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone and IV fluids. Her Hb was 7. 3 g/dL.

40|$|Introduction: The {{estimation}} of serum ferritin level {{is a method}} of determining iron status. We studied the iron status {{of a group of}} non-chronically transfused children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA), using their serum ferritin levels. Objective: To determine the iron status among children with SCA in steady state in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Material and methods: The study was carried out at the Consultant Paediatric Haematology Outpatient Clinic of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals' Complex, Ile-Ife between June and September 2013. History and clinical examination were evaluated in 48 HbSS subjects and 48 HbAA controls to ascertain {{that they did not have}} features of acute illness. Serum ferritin levels were assayed in both subjects and controls. Results/Discussion: The age range of both subjects and controls was 1 ‚Äì 15 years. The mean age was 8. 0 (4. 0) for both groups. The serum ferritin levels ranged from 34. 2 to 3282. 9 ¬†Œºg/l with mean of 381. 2 (1. 0), median 180 ¬†Œºg/l; this was significantly higher than that for the controls, with range of 3. 7 ‚Äì 26. 6 ¬†Œºg/l, mean 46. 1 (0. 9) and median of 33. 9 ¬†Œºg/l (p¬†=¬† 0. 000). Among the SCA group 31 (64. 6 %) had had blood transfusion while 17 (35. 4 %) had not. The mean of the serum ferritin levels was not significantly higher in the group with blood transfusion compared with the group without blood transfusion (p¬†=¬† 0. 923). Serum ferritin level was greater than 300 ¬†Œºg/l in 16 (33. 3 %) subjects with SCA, 6 (37. 5 %) of whom had no history of blood transfusion. There was no significant correlation between serum ferritin levels and age, haemoglobin concentration and number of blood transfusions. Conclusion: Despite not being on chronic <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>programme,</b> higher serum ferritin levels indicative of iron overload were found in the SCA group compared with the controls.

40|$|Over a {{transition}} period of approximately 10 years, the transfusion service {{has moved from}} {{a situation in which}} donors were paid a fee for each visit to the blood bank to that of regular, unpaid contributions. This study set out to measure two important aspects of this change to a non-remunerated system of blood donations:¬† any fall in the number of eligible donors and changes in the incidence of serological markers. ¬† This was carried out by an analysis of the data from two studies. i) ¬† A retrospective analysis of 10 years of data returns (1990 - 1999) from the blood donation programme, which seeks to make comparisons between paid and unpaid donors in terms of the incidence of positive serological markers. ii) ¬† A prospective study to obtain and evaluate community knowledge about blood donation {{in all parts of the}} United Arab Emirates, sampling existing donors and non-donors. An initial survey of 500 subjects, 250 donors and 250 non-donors was carried out at the beginning of the study and then repeated one year later. From both studies the following conclusions were reached. 1) ¬† There is a continuing need to emphasize public awareness by education and blood donation. 2) ¬† There should be a concentration on educated people in the retention of blood donors and the application of the importance of voluntary, non-remunerated donors. 3) ¬† The promotion of participation in the <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>programme</b> by those of a lower level of education should also be encouraged. 4) ¬† Students from varying socio-economic levels are an important target group. 5) ¬† The support given to mobile campaigns throughout the Emirates should be increased. 6) Greater use of the media to reach the population and encourage recruitment and motivation is required. 7) ¬† The establishment of ‚ÄòBlood Donor Committees‚Äô in the Universities is necessary to encourage students to become future blood donors. 8) ¬† There should be greater emphasis on the work of Preachers in the mosques and other religious institutions, to discuss blood donation and link to humanitarian practice.

40|$|SHOT (Serious Hazards of Transfusion scheme) is the UK‚Äôs National {{confidential}} haemovigilance system, and {{was set up}} in 1996. It is an independent, confidential, professionally led haemovigilance scheme. Initially {{the reporting}} was voluntary but now required by several professional bodies. SHOT publishes annual reports with recommendations and circulates to all relevant organizations including the 4 UK Blood services, Departments of Health in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, all relevant professional bodies and reporting hospitals. Over the 17 years of reporting, the evidence gathered has prompted changes in transfusion practice from the selection and management of donors to changes in hospital practice, better education and training. Acute transfusion reactions and transfusion-associated circulatory overload carry the highest risk for morbidity and death. Greatest risk to patients remain errors in the process at the point of blood sampling, in the laboratory and at bedside administration. SHOT‚Äôs objectives are to use findings to improve standards of hospital transfusion practice, to educate users on transfusion hazards and prevention, to aid production of clinical guidelines in blood transfusion and to inform national policy on transfusion safety. MHRA is the UK competent authority to which serious adverse reactions and events have to be reported annually. Overall the most common adverse incidents are caused by errors, resulting in the transfusion of an incorrect component or one that does not meet the specific requirements of the patient (e. g. not irradiated or not appropriately antigen matched). TACO (transfusion associated circulatory overload) accounts for most deaths and major morbidity reported to SHOT but is overall underreported. Transfusions are not always given appropriately. This may be due to wrong haemoglobin results, failure to assess patients appropriately, or avoidable use of emergency O RhD negative units because of poor communication or planning. Review of cases of haemolytic transfusion reactions (HTR) shows that they are observed mainly in Sickle Cell Disease patients. HTR are associated with major morbidity (10 / 16 cases in sickle cell patients over 3 years) and death (a child in 2010). SCD patients are at particular risk of alloimmunization and this can be reduced by red cell phenotyping prior to the first transfusion followed by routine matching for at least the Rh and Kell groups. SHOT output data led over the time to the development of strategies to improve transfusion safety such as the implementation of guidelines for improving practice, implementation of the National Comparative Audit of <b>Blood</b> <b>Transfusion</b> <b>programme,</b> the publication of the Better blood transfusion initiatives and the establishment of The UK transfusion laboratory collaborative...|$|E

The records of all patients who underwent esophageal resection (n = 316) at UCLA Medical Center from 1970 to 1993 were reviewed. Statistical analysis included univariate (log-rank œá 2) and multivariate (Cox proportional hazards) analyses with other known risk factors. High-volume <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> (> 8 units) but not low-volume <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> (1 to 8 units) were associated with {{a significant decrease in}} long-term survival (median survival: no transfusion, 22 months; low-volume <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion,</b> 14. 5 months, versus high-volume <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions,</b> 6. 5 months; p < 0. 01).

This {{might be due to}} an increasing awareness of the effects and risks of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion.</b> In clinical transfusion practice a transfusion trigger is handled for the prescription of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion.</b> This transfusion trigger is based on hemoglobin (Hb) levels for red <b>blood</b> cell (RBC) <b>transfusion</b> and on platelet count for platelet transfusions. Possibilities to improve the safety of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> are improvement of the blood components and reduction of the amount of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions.</b> This thesis describes 1) an in vitro study of a new pathogen technique for platelet concentrates and 2) a new model for RBC transfusion therapy for acute anemia. This model uses subjective health related quality of life criteria, which are validated in this thesis...|$|R
2500|$|A {{blood product}} (or blood-based product) is any {{component}} of blood which is collected from a donor {{for use in}} a <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion.</b> <b>Blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> can be life-saving in some situations, such as massive blood loss due to trauma, or can be used to replace blood lost during surgery. <b>Blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> may also be used to treat a severe anaemia or thrombocytopenia caused by a blood disease. People with hemophilia usually need a replacement of clotting factor, which is a small part of whole blood. [...] People with sickle-cell disease may require frequent <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions.</b> [...] Early <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> consisted of whole blood, but modern medical practice commonly uses only components of the blood, such as fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Haemovigilance {{is defined}} as a set of {{surveillance}} procedures from the collection of blood and its components to the follow‚Äìup of recipients, denoted to collect and assess information on unexpected or undesirable effects resulting from the therapeutic use of labile blood products, and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence. In this system the complications of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> are systematically collected and reported and data of adverse effects of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> are analyzed and a series of corrective measures are performed to prevent the recurrence of them. Another goal of haemovigilance is documentary collections of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> cases which eventually leads to conducting and promoting <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> in hospitals. Haemovigilance only works if complications of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> are early detected and reported. Keywords: Haemovigilanc...|$|R
