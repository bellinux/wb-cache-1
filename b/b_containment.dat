40|$|Europe and Iran {{have had}} {{important}} political, cultural and commercial relations that date back several centuries, but these relations have been steadily strained since 2002 when the uncertainty {{with regard to}} Iran 2 ̆ 019 s nuclear program became an issue of international concern. In demonstrating its role as an important foreign-policy actor capable of taking the lead in resolving global crises, through the leadership of France, Germany and the United Kingdom (the EU 3) the EU has spearheaded efforts to obtain {{a solution to the}} deadlock between Tehran and the international community over Iran 2 ̆ 019 s nuclear program. This approach has not been fully successful in achieving its goal and has contributed to straining EU-Iran relations. The EU has yet to develop a unified, independent and long-term strategy vis- 0 -vis Iran that would enable it to maintain a constructive relationship with Tehran and achieve its strategic objectives without compromising its core values. The four strategies available to the EU are: a) use of force/military action; <b>b)</b> <b>containment</b> and deterrence; c) engagement; and d) non-entanglement. While the EU 2 ̆ 019 s short 2 ̆ 013 term tactics represent a mixture of engagement and containment, this paper argues that, in the case of Iran, the two approaches cancel each other out. To increase its leverage on Iran on the nuclear issue and beyond, the EU must adopt a realpolitik strategy of d 9 tente, building confidence with the regime in Tehran and obtaining policy progress through non-controversial mutual areas of interest. The EU High Representative should also take {{a more active role in}} leading the EU 2 ̆ 019 s efforts...|$|E

How did the formation of the 'German model' become possible in the face of employers’ structural power? The thesis confronts two alternative theoretical approaches for explaining employers’ acceptance of market-correcting institutions: an economic-functionalist approach ('crossclass coalition thesis') and a political-strategic approach ('political accommodation thesis'). The first one focuses on economic benefits derived by specific types of firms from welfare state and industrial relations institutions, the second on political constraints and changes in the political power structure, and employers’ strategic responses to them. The thesis finds that the political accommodation thesis has greater explanatory power and challenges business interest-based explanations of welfare state development. The empirical analysis in the thesis traces the preferences (interest perceptions), strategic considerations, and resulting policy positions of the national employer federations in Germany during three different political regimes: the Wilhelmine Empire (1871 - 1918), the inter-war Weimar Republic (1918 - 1933), and the post-war Federal Republic (1949 - 1990 s). The analysis focuses on those historical reform events that, in retrospect, came to shape welfare state and industrial relations institutions in Germany. Process analysis based on historical sources and diachronic comparison are used as methods to reconstruct (i) the motivations of employers for supporting or opposing specific policy options, and (ii) the socio-political and institutional environment within which employers formed their preferences and strategies. The thesis studies Germany as a crucial case study because of the paradigmatic character of this country as a type of non-liberal capitalism that is often understood to benefit certain types of firms today. Empirically, the thesis finds that socio-political and institutional constraints motivated employers to accept specific policies and institutions, rather than hard-wired economic interests. The thesis identifies two dominant employer strategies in welfare state politics: (a) pacification of radicalized elements within labor, and (<b>b)</b> <b>containment</b> of expansionary reform projects. Moreover, the thesis finds that employers consistently preferred conservative types of social policies to universalist (social democratic) alternatives, and explains this as a result of differential impacts on work incentives. The deliberate formation of cross-class coalitions is found to have been rare and to have happened only under conditions of extraordinary political and economic uncertainty. Issues of skill formation are found to have played a marginal role...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThree {{materials}} SUS 304, 9 % Ni {{steel and}} Al 5083 -O alloy, which are considered possible candidate for International Maritime Organization (IMO) type <b>B</b> Cargo <b>Containment</b> System, were studied. Monotonic tensile, fatigue, fatigue {{crack growth rate}} and Crack Tip Opening Displacement tests were carried out at room, intermediate low (- 100 °C) and cryogenic (- 163 °C) temperatures. The initial yield and tensile strengths of all materials tended to increase with decreasing temperature, whereas the change in elastic modulus was not as remarkable. The largest and smallest improvement ratio of the initial yield strengths due to a temperature reduction were observed in the SUS 304 and Al 5083 -O alloy, respectively. The fatigue strengths of the three materials increased with decreasing temperature. The largest increase in fatigue strength was observed in the Al 5083 -O alloy, whereas the 9 % Ni steel sample showed the smallest increase. In the fatigue crack growth rate test, SUS 304 and Al 5083 -O alloy showed {{a decrease in the}} crack propagation rate, due to decrease in temperature, but no visible improvement in da/dN was observed in the case of 9 % Ni steel. In the Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD) test, CTOD values were converted to critical crack length for the comparison with different thickness specimens. The critical crack length tended to decrease in the case of SUS 304 and increase for the Al 5083 -O alloy with decreasing temperature. In case of 9 % Ni steel, change of critical crack length was not observed due to temperature decrease. In addition, the changing material properties according to the temperature of the LNG tank were analyzed according to the international code for the construction and equipment of ships carrying liquefied gases in bulk (IGC code) and the rules of classifications...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{critically}} examines traditional positivist interpretations {{concerning the}} birth of four core norms of the current legal regime governing activities of states in Outer Space: a) non-militarization, b) peaceful use, c) non- appropriation, and d) freedom of access.

Analysis of {{the first decade of the}} space age through the lens of post-structural genealogical method proposed by Richard Price reveals a much more complex picture. Application of critical genealogical approach indicates that the emergence of the four norms in question was contingent on the presence of particular historical circumstances and cognitive structures of the Cold War: a) fear of nuclear weapons, <b>b)</b> policy of <b>containment,</b> c) trauma of the Second World War, and d) highly politicized outer space discourse due to the presence of the space race.

A walk, W, in G is a D-walk if the consecutive colors encountered on W also form {{a walk in}} D. A set S⊆V(G) is a D-sink if any x∈V(G) -S reaches some y∈S on a D-walk. We say S is D-independent (resp. independent) if no two vertices of S have a D-walk (resp. have an arc) between them. Let D∈B 2 (resp.

40|$|Abstract. Most grassfires {{that occur}} in {{southern}} Australia are contained to small areas by local suppression resources. Those that are not require extra resources from neighbouring districts. Identifying these fires {{at the start of}} initial attack can prompt early resource requests so that resources arrive earlier when they canmore effectively assist with containment. This study uses operational data collected from Australian grassfires that used ground tankers and aircraft for suppression. Variables were limited to those available when the first situation report is provided to incident controllers and included weather parameters, resource response times, slope, curing state, pasture condition and estimated fire area at initial attack. Logistic regression and classification trees were used to identify grassfires likely to escape initial attack by (a) becoming large (final area$ 100 ha), (<b>b)</b> beingof longduration (<b>containment</b> time$ 4 h) or (c) either or both of these. These fireswould benefit from havingmore resources deployed to them than are normally available. The best models used initial fire area and Grassland Fire Danger Index as predictor variables. Preliminary operational decision guides developed from classification trees could be used by fire managers to make quick assessments of the need for extra resources at early stages of a fire...|$|R
40|$|A {{bacterial}} containment chamber {{was used}} to evaluate the peritoneal cellular response to Bacteroides fragilis during intraperitoneal challenge. This containment system was also used to determine the fate of bacteria within the peritoneal cavities of animals immunized, either actively or through adoptive transfer of cells or cell lysates, with the capsular polysaccharide of B. fragilis. This system demonstrated that the dominant cell types in the peritoneal cavities within 48 h of implantation of the <b>containment</b> chambers containing <b>B.</b> fragilis were neutrophils and macrophages. However, the early cellular response in immunized animals included an increase in the lymphocyte population within 4 h of challenge which was not detected in naive animals. In immunized animals, a later dramatic increase in the lymphocyte population at approximately 4 to 6 days following implantation of the containment chambers occurred. This increase in the lymphocyte population in immunized animals coincided with a decline in the viable bacterial counts within the chambers from 10 (8) to 10 (9) CFU/ml to less than 10 (2) CFU/ml. A similar decline was not seen in naive animals challenged in the same manner. Killing of <b>B.</b> fragilis within <b>containment</b> chambers occurred when spleen cells, T cells, or lysates of T cells from actively immunized animals were passively transferred to naive recipient animals. It was shown that the factor responsible for bacterial killing was not antibody mediated, since bacteria contained within dialysis sacs with an exclusion of 50 kilodaltons were still killed in this model. Moreover, removal of T cells from adoptively transferred cell populations before transfer abrogated the decline in viable bacterial populations. The postulated mechanisms by which this bacterial killing occurred are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contends that}} a {{corporate}} merger, {{on the scale}} of a global order, is a 'catastrophic change' and depends on 'killing off' parts of the former organisations for its success. The act of annihilating parts of the former organisations is experienced as disengaged and murderous by organisational members. This arouses persecutory anxiety of an unbearable intensity amongst members from which they defend themselves by emotionally disconnecting from the psychic reality of the organisation. Several contentions underpin the hypothesis: 1. that a merger involves a developmental process in the creation and growth of a new organisation; 2. the event of a merger causes disruptions to roles and relationships that are experienced as a loss of power, status and identity, and also as an emotional loss for what had been cherished and valued in the former organisation/s; 3. the emotional loss evokes the symbolic experience of the loss of a 'loved object', and an instinctual loss becomes attached thereby to the real losses; and thus, 4. the process of merger involves a symbolic destruction of the 'loved organisational object' of the former organisations, as held in the minds of organisational members. The thesis is based on case study research conducted on the topic of emotional connectedness in a network organisation over a three year period. Fieldwork began at the time when the participating firm had just formed from a global merger of two large global enterprises. The Australia-New Zealand regional operations were the focus of the study. The research discovered a significant degree of emotional disconnectedness due to: 1. the nature of the work that required staff to work on client sites, away from home and often alone; 2. a multiplicity of organisational structures that engendered fragmentary connections; 3. valuing individuals' self-reliance over and above the interdependence of organisational members; 4. the many external changes experienced by the firm from the effects of the merger and from market economics, political and business turmoil, and for the Australia- New Zealand operations, a shift in the location of their corporate head office from North America to Europe; 5. increasing uncertainty within the industry, and a commensurate increase in competitiveness; 6. a loss of profitability in the Asia-Pacific region in which the case study participants were located; 7. the turnover in the regional director's role, with three appointments in less than two years; 8. dramatic rises and falls in staff numbers, ranging from an initial 450, to a high of 750, and sudden decline to 120 people during the period of the study; 9. the reluctance of vice-presidents and directors to take up a corporate management role, preferring to work as 'project managers' on client assignments; and 10. all these factors contributing to an anxiety {{about the future of the}} Australia-New Zealand (A-NZ) operations which was expressed as a fear of survival. In response to these many factors, staff and management felt vulnerable and insecure, experiencing the merger as an annihilation of 'loved objects'. These included the loss of a partner's autonomy and ownership in the firm, familiar work procedures, and the loss of belonging to a partner's work group and associated long-term relationships. The emotional aspects of dealing with these losses and feelings were placed upon individuals to manage for themselves. The burden of ensuring the survival of the firm was displaced upon individuals, such that consultants became not only the 'container for work', but also the 'container for the organisation's survival'. As the merger progressed and more changes to the business were implemented with little to no containment of people's felt experiences, the psychic reality of the A-NZ operations became saturated with persecutory anxiety. In some parts of these operations, the anxiety became so great that group interactions (what there were of them) seemed psychotic. Those in management roles displayed a level of anxiety that appeared to be unbearable for the individuals concerned, and which resulted at times in manic responses to the human and commercial needs of the business. Bion's theories of catastrophic change and emotional links, and Klein's theories on persecutory and depressive anxieties are applied to understanding the systems psychodynamics of the effects of the merger upon the organisation. The case reveals the presence of persecutory anxiety in the immediate aftermath of the merger, lasting for nearly three years. Various social defence mechanisms are identified as being used by organisational members against this anxiety. They are: the co-existence of multiple organisational structures; a sentient sub-system of 'counselling families'; idealisation of autonomous individuals; plus, the mechanisms of projection, denial and regression. Four factors are identified as significant for containing destructive forces in a corporate merger: a) the role of emotional links to understanding the internal reality of a newly merged organisation; <b>b)</b> the <b>containment</b> of experiences of catastrophic change and projective processes; c) managing the realistic and neurotic anxieties of organisational members; and, d) identifying and managing the primary risk in a merger. A model is presented on the systems psychodynamics of a corporate merger. It identifies the change process that a merger entails, and the psychodynamics of this process using Bion's concept of container'contained. The thesis contributes to understanding the psychic reality of organisational mergers and offers a perspective that being alert to staff members' felt experiences and their emotional connectedness, as a normal part of business, provides 'leading data' on the health of the enterprise. Managers who are more 'wholly' informed about organisational realities, both external and psychic realities, can work more realistically on resolving problems, assessing risks, or making strategic business decisions...|$|R
