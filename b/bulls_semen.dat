40|$|The {{fertility}} or “calf getting ” {{ability of}} a bull is influenced by many factors such as: • Structure or conformation of the skeletal and reproduction organs. • Semen quality (motility, % Normal). • Disease and injury history. • Libido or sex drive. A combination of these factors generally deems a sire fertile, sub-fertile or infertile. A structural point that often causes great debate in regards to bull fertility is the sheath. Before you can delve into this debate {{you need to understand}} its physiology and function. What is the Sheath and what is its Function? The sheath is the protective structure of skin surrounding the <b>bulls</b> <b>semen</b> delivery system, i. e. prepuce and penis. Structures of interest on the sheath are the preputial opening, naval rosette and umbilicus.

40|$|The overall aims were {{to learn}} more about factors {{affecting}} fertility in Swedish beef sires in general and in yearling beef bulls in particular, focusing mainly on sexual maturity and hind limb health finding useful tools {{in order to be able}} to routinely perform a complete bull breeding soundness evaluations in Swedish beef <b>bulls.</b> <b>Semen</b> was collected from yearling beef bulls, postmortem, and the sperm morphology was evaluated. Using a strict definition, based on sperm morphology, we could demonstrate that less than half the number of the bulls was considered sexually mature at 12 months of age. Samples collected by transrectal massage were compared with the two most commonly used collection methods; artificial vagina and electroejaculation, and with samples collected by cauda epididymal dissection postmortem. Sperm morphology in semen collected by transrectal massage was as representative as in samples collected by artificial vagina and electroejaculation and to some extent also in those collected postmortem. However, reduction in volume, concentration and motility would need to be considered, especially if semen is collected outdoors under suboptimal conditions. In conclusion, the transrectal massage technique is a very useful semen collection method in the field when no other collection method is possible, thus enabling a complete bull breeding soundness evaluation. Femorotibial, femoropatellar (stifle), tarsocrural, talocalcaneus, and proximal intertarsal joints from young beef sires with impaired fertility, but no signs of lameness, were examined postmortem regarding the presence of joint lesions. A majority of the bulls had severe, bilateral lesions referred to as osteoarthritis secondary to osteochondrosis dissecans. We think that the osteoarthritis present in the hind limbs must have contributed to the infertility, rendering the bulls difficulties in mounting. The fact that most of the lesions were bilateral, could explain the absence of clinical lameness. The results of this study indicate that the poor fertility reported in these beef bulls can be a result of joint problems, secondary to osteochondrosis. Thus, joint lesions should always be taken into consideration as a contributory cause of reproductive failure in beef sires with or without symptoms of lameness...|$|E

Little research has evaluated the effect of an injectable trace mineral product, {{in conjunction with a}} dietary mineral supplementation program, on reproduction. This thesis includes two separate studies evaluating the use of an injectable trace mineral product, in addition to a dietary mineral program, on the reproductive success of yearling bulls and heifers. In the first study, we hypothesized that when dietary trace mineral needs are met, administration of an injectable trace mineral product to developing beef bulls would cause a short-term increase in circulating trace mineral concentrations, but not alter semen quality nor ability to pass a breeding soundness examination. Trace mineral treatment did not affect scrotal circumferences and BW of bulls throughout the trial (P [equal to or greater than] 0. 20). Trace Mineral bulls had greater (P [equal to or less than] 0. 0001) trace mineral concentrations at 8 h post-treatment than Control <b>bulls.</b> <b>Semen</b> trace mineral concentrations on d 42 and 91 were similar (P [equal to or greater than] 0. 52) between treatments. Sperm parameters improved (P [equal to or less than] 0. 003) from d 42 to 91, but did not differ (P [equal to or greater than] 0. 06) between treatments. A similar (P = 0. 94) percentage of Trace Mineral (67 %) and Control (68 %) bulls passed a BSE 91 d post-treatment. In the present study, supplemental trace mineral injection was successful at raising circulating trace mineral levels, but did not alter semen trace mineral levels nor improve semen quality. In the second study we hypothesized that when dietary trace mineral needs are met, the use of an injectable trace mineral product in developing heifers would not affect pregnancy rates at single service fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI). Trace Mineral heifers had greater (P = 0. 02) pregnancy rates (51. 28 %) than Control heifers (25. 58 %). The percentage of Trace Mineral (30. 77 %) and Control heifers (47. 50 %) that displayed estrous behavior prior to FTAI as indicated by a red estrous detection patch was not different (P = 0. 13) between treatments. In the present study, despite dietary trace mineral requirements being met, use of an injectable trace mineral injection improved pregnancy rates following FTAI, but did not affect estrous behavior...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{assume the}} existence differences in bulls spermatozoa viability after thawing, characterized by higher values of motility and {{higher proportion of}} live spermatozoa, in case of prolonged equilibration and lower temperature freezing gradient. The aim of this thesis was to find the influence of different equilibration and freezing curve conditions to on spermatozoa viability after thawing. The theoretical part of the thesis summarizes available information about the <b>bulls</b> <b>semen</b> parameters, methods for its evaluation and especially the processing and long-term preservation. Within the case study part of the thesis, during the years 2013 - 2015 the semen of the pre-selected group of 5 breeding bulls was being collected at the Sires insemination center. The group was uniform as to age, breed and housing and treatment conditions. After initial assessment the collected semen was divided into parts, which were then processed in different wals. A part of straws was processed by standard protocol, the other part was processed using different length of equilibration and freezing curve. First part of the straws was equilibrated in a standard protocol for 120 minutes; subsequently half of the equilibrated straws was standardly frozen by the Direct Freezing method based on 3 -phase freezing curve while the other half was frozen using the different 2 -phase freezing curve. Second part of the straws was initially equilibrated for 240 minutes with the subsequent freezing, similarly {{as in the previous}} case, used 3 -phase and 2 -phase freezing curve. Frozen straws were then stored in liquid nitrogen container at - 196 °C. Spermatozoa motility was evaluated using CASA. The semen was further evaluated on the proportion of live and dead spermatozoa, using coloration of Eosin and Nigrosine, and on the sensitivity of the spermatozoa membranes, using HOS test, which detects the reaction of spermatozoa tail membrane to hypoosmotic conditions. The obtained results indicated higher progressive spermatozoa motility (+ 5. 57 %) and higher percentage of live spermatozoa (+ 4. 47 %) following the application of the prolonged equilibration (240 min). When applying the length of equilibration 240 minutes, the values of total spermatozoa motility and HOS test were higher as well, though the differences were not statistically significant. When evaluate the effect of using different freezing curves on the parameters of the spermatozoa after thawing, higher values (average + 1. 6 %) at almost all of these parameters using 3 -phase freezing curve were found, the diferrences were not statistically significant. Statistically significant differences among the bulls (P < 0. 01) were found in total as well as progressive spermatozoa motility, in the proportion of living spermatozoa and in value of the HOS test - the individuality among the bulls is therefore evident. While evaluating the characteristics of spermatozoa movement by CASA, statistically significant differences among the bulls were confirmed at VCL, VSL, VAP, LIN, STR, WOB (P < 0. 01), also between the diferrent length of equilibration (P < 0. 01), but were not statistically significant when using diferrent freezing curves...|$|E
