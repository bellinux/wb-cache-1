40|$|To {{determine}} whether thyroidal status {{is related to}} migratory and settling behavior in Anguilla anguilla glass eels, we sampled glass eels showing different migratory behaviors in the Arzal dam, which constitutes the tidal limit of the Vilaine River (France). We collected 4 groups of glass eels: flood and ebb tide glass eels were netted in the estuary during the flood and ebb tides, respectively, trap glass eels were sampled from the eel ladder trap, and <b>bottom</b> <b>glass</b> eels sheltering {{on the bottom of}} the estuary during flood tide. We measured individual whole-body triiodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4) levels for these groups, and calculated total thyroid hormone (TH) levels as T 3 + T 4 contents reflecting the thyroid gland secretory activity, and T 3 :T 4 ratios reflecting T 4 outer-ring desiodase (T 4 ORD) activity. Trap glass eels had the highest TH levels, indicating an activation of the thyroid gland via the thyreotrop axis. This could be responsible for the behavioral transition (loss of circatidal rhythm and switch to counter-current swimming) at the tidal limit and active colonization of river habitats by glass eels. Ebb and flood tide glass eels had similar TH levels that were lower than those of trap glass eels, indicating a lower thyroid gland secretory activity in the former. Ebb tide glass eels had higher T 3 :T 4 ratios than flood tide and trap glass eels, indicating physiological stress related to inefficient use of tidal streams. <b>Bottom</b> <b>glass</b> eels had the lowest TH levels, and high T 3 :T 4 ratios similar to those of ebb tide glass eels; this suggests that physiological stress induced by frequent counter-current swimming leads to precocious settlement of glass eels in estuarine habitats. Our data supports the critical role of the thyroid status in the migratory and settling behavior of glass eels in estuarine and marine habitats...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a novel optoelectronic tweezer using light induced dielectrophoresis mechanism to optically {{trap and transport}} micro particles with optical power in the µW range. This device consists of two pattern-less surfaces: a <b>bottom</b> <b>glass</b> substrate coated with photoconductive material and a top transparent indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass. To achieve optical trapping, we sandwich the liquid-immersed micro particles between these two surfaces and supply an ac electric bias. A 633 -nm He-Ne laser focused by a 40 x objective lens is used to transport the particles. Negative dielectrophoretic trapping is demonstrated in this paper. Our experiment results show that optical beam with power as low as 1 µW is sufficient to transport 25 -µmdiameter latex particles at a speed of 4. 5 µm/sec. The transport speed increases with higher optical power. A maximum speed of 397 µm/sec is observed at 100 µW...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical study that investigates {{the behavior of}} continuous concrete decks doubly reinforced with top and <b>bottom</b> <b>glass</b> fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars subjected to top surface fire. A finite element (FE) model is developed and a detailed transient thermal analysis is performed on a continuous concrete bridge deck under the effect of various fire curves. A parametric study is performed to examine the top cover thickness and the critical fire exposure curve needed to fully degrade the top GFRP bars while achieving certain fire ratings for the deck considered. Accordingly, design tables are prepared for each fire curve to guide the engineer to properly size the top concrete cover and maintain {{the temperature in the}} GFRP bars below critical design values in order to control the full top GFRP degradation. It is notable to indicate that degradation of top GFRP bars do not pose a collapse hazard but rather a serviceability concern since cracks in the negative moment region widen resulting in simply supported spans.|$|E

For this, PZI (protozoea 1) larvae were stocked in 2 -L round <b>bottom</b> <b>glass</b> flasks in two replicates at 20, 25, 30 and 35 ppt salinities and were reared on live diets until PL (postlarvae) stages. Highest survival (91 %) and greatest growth (6. 48 mm) at postlarval stages (PLI/ 2) were obtained with the larvae cultured at 25 ppt (P 0. 05) compared to the other salinities. Larval mortality rate at 5 ppt and 35 ppt were 1. 65 and 5. 04 % day- 1. Larval growth rate of the larvae reared at all salinities ranged between 0. 63 and 0. 68 mm day- 1. The fastest larval development at the metamorphosis was achieved at 20 and 25 ppt. The larvae (PZI) at 28 °C and 25 ppt metamorphosed into PLI stage within only 7 days. Hence, the optimum salinity for the larval culture of P. indicus originated from India lies between 20 and 25 ppt...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the great}} {{potentials}} of glass as a construction material, its brittle material behaviour poses major challenges to structural engineers when designing load-bearing glass structural members. This paper presents the load response {{and the failure}} behaviour of float glass–GFRP hybrid beams, when used as a mean of improving strength and ductility of float glass. Hybrid beams made from two layers of float glass sheets and an adhesively-bonded semi-transparent pre-cured GFRP interlayer were tested in four-point bending. The experimental results showed that double layer hybrid beams continued to take load even after {{the formation of the}} first major crack, and the beams were stronger and ductile than conventional single and multilayer float glass beams. Once the <b>bottom</b> <b>glass</b> layer has cracked the combination of the GFRP and the top glass layer carried the applied load whilst the gradual decrease in the stiffness due to the formation of new cracks ensures a ductile failure. Experimentally-validated finite element (FE) models that predict the evolution of stresses, stiffness and failure load of single and double layer glass beams, and glass– GFRP hybrid beams are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) is a {{versatile}} tool in lab-on-chip systems since it controls fluid shape and flow by electrical signals alone without using external pumps and related tube connections. The most versatile EWOD configuration (allowing transport, division and mixing of droplets) is the closed one, where the fluid handling occurs between two coupled glasses. However, {{the use of}} EWOD-based lab-on-chip is often laborious due to the necessity of spacers between the bottom and top glasses {{as well as of}} oil to confine the solution droplets and to avoid fluid evaporation. In order to overcome these issues, we have developed a new technology called In-Channel EWOD (ICEWOD) relying on the microelectronic definition of the microfluidic channel in the top glass and on the microelectronic fabrication of the EWOD electrodes in the <b>bottom</b> <b>glass.</b> Experiments, performed injecting a saline solution in the reservoir (see Figure 2 c), demonstrated both the successful dispensing of separate droplets from the reservoir and their subsequent movement along the electrodes to fill the central chamber.
