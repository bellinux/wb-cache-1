5|$|Moral {{rights in}} United Kingdom law {{are parts of}} {{copyright}} law that protect the personal interests of {{the author of a}} copyrighted work, as well as the economic interests protected by other elements of copyright.

5|$|The {{degree to}} which the {{character}} of Alice can <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> Alice Liddell is controversial. Some critics identify the character as Liddell, or write that she inspired the character. Others argue that Carroll considered his protagonist and Liddell to be separate. According to Carroll, his character was not based on any real child, but was entirely fictional.|$|E
5|$|Christian and Muslim {{philosophers}} modified Ptolemy's {{system to}} include an unmoved outermost region, the empyrean heaven, which came to <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> the dwelling place of God and all the elect. Medieval Christians identified the sphere of stars with the Biblical firmament and sometimes posited an invisible layer of water above the firmament, to accord with Genesis. An outer sphere, inhabited by angels, appeared in some accounts.|$|E

5|$|In captive Egyptian fruit bats, 70% of the {{directed}} calls could <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> {{to which}} bat made it, and 60% could be categorised into four contexts: squabbling over food, jostling over position in their sleeping cluster, protesting over mating attempts and arguing when perched {{in close proximity}} to each other. The animals made slightly different sounds when communicating with different individuals, especially one of the opposite sex. Male hammerheaded bats produce deep, resonating, monotonous calls to attract females. Bats in flight make vocal signal for traffic control. Individual greater bulldog bats honk when {{on a collision course with}} each other.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} what human organs are {{affected}} by interaction with promethium; a possible candidate is the bone tissues. Sealed promethium-147 is not dangerous. However, if the packaging is damaged, then promethium becomes dangerous {{to the environment and}} humans. If radioactive contamination is found, the contaminated area should be washed with water and soap, but, even though promethium mainly affects the skin, the skin should not be abraded. If a promethium leak is found, the area should <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> hazardous and evacuated, and emergency services must be contacted. No dangers from promethium aside from the radioactivity are known.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus zapfei can <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> a Miniopterus on {{the basis}} of the {{possession}} of three lower premolars (designated p2, p3, and p4, because the original first premolar has been lost); a two-rooted p3; and the nyctalodont molars, with the posterolophid (a crest at the back of the molar) behind the entoconid cusp. M.zapfei is about 30% larger than M.fossilis and has a more slender p4. Compared to living Miniopterus, the cingulum (shelf) that surrounds the P4 is less well-developed and the parastyle crest is weaker.|$|E

5|$|The Rokeby Venus {{depicts the}} Roman goddess of love, beauty and {{fertility}} reclining languidly on her bed, {{her back to}} the viewer—in Antiquity, portrayal of Venus from a back view was a common visual and literary erotic motif—and her knees tucked. She is shown without the mythological paraphernalia normally included in depictions of the scene; jewellery, roses, and myrtle are all absent. Unlike most earlier portrayals of the goddess, which show her with blond hair, Velázquez's Venus is a brunette. The female figure can <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> Venus {{because of the presence of}} her son, Cupid.|$|E

5|$|The prey {{does not}} have to be {{attracted}} towards the predator for the predator to benefit: it is sufficient for the predator simply not to <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> a threat. Wicklerian-Eisnerian mimics may resemble a mutualistic ally, or a species of little significance to the prey such as a commensal. For example, the spider Arachnocoris berytoides resembles Faiditus caudatus, a spider commensal of ants.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} conducted unearthed square or circular Chera coins made {{of copper}} from near Cochin.

The coin, which is almost a square in shape, has an elephant facing to the right and some symbols towards the top of the coin. The symbols could not <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> {{the upper part of the}} coin was partially corroded. A drawn bow and arrow was visible on the other side. Below the arrow is an elephant goad (a prod used to control elephants). These coins bear a striking resemblance to the ones excavated from Karur in Tamil Nadu, said the archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|Arrowmen are {{identified}} {{by a white}} sash bearing a red arrow that is worn over their right shoulder. An Ordeal member wears a sash with a lone arrow.

Members wear the sash at Order of the Arrow functions and special Scouting activities when members need to <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> Arrowmen rendering special services. The OA sash is not worn at the same time as the merit badge sash, nor worn folded in the belt. The sash as a form of recognition dates to the founding of the Order and has a long history of changes in usage and design.|$|E

5|$|Berlin {{surrendered}} on 2 May. Records in the Soviet archives obtained {{after the}} fall of the Soviet Union state that the remains of Hitler, Braun, Joseph and Magda Goebbels, the six Goebbels children, General Hans Krebs, and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg. The remains from the boxes were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the Elbe. According to Kershaw, the corpses of Braun and Hitler were fully burned when the Red Army found them, and only a lower jaw with dental work could <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> Hitler's remains.|$|E
5|$|Bond is {{eventually}} captured by Gorner in the heroin plant, who explains that Bond {{is to be}} used as bait during a drugs delivery across the Afghan desert, and should he survive an expected ambush, is to fly the captured airliner into the Russian heartland. Bond would <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> British upon its destruction, increasing the evidence against the British Government. Bond survives the predicted Afghan attack and plots an escape attempt, which sees Scarlett get away due to Bond surrendering himself as a diversion. In the morning he is taken aboard the aeroplane. Before the airliner can bomb the Soviets, with the aid of the airliner's pilot and Scarlett (who had been hiding on board), Bond regains control of the aeroplane and crashes it into a mountainside after parachuting to safety.|$|E
5|$|Gergonne's insight {{was that}} if a line L1 could be {{constructed}} such that A1 and B1 were guaranteed to fall on it, those two points could <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> the intersection points of L1 with the given circle C1 (Figure6). The remaining four tangent points would be located similarly, by finding lines L2 and L3 that contained A2 and B2, and A3 and B3, respectively. To construct a line such as L1, two points must be identified that lie on it; but these points need not be the tangent points. Gergonne was able to identify two other points {{for each of the}} three lines. One of the two points has already been identified: the radical center G lies on all three lines (Figure6).|$|E
