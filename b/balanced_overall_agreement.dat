30|$|The <b>overall</b> <b>agreement</b> or {{percentage}} agreement (Hartmann 1977) {{between two}} or more tools is the proportion of instances (classes or methods) that were classified {{in the same category}} by both tools, for the <b>overall</b> <b>agreement</b> between pairs, or by all tools, in the case of <b>overall</b> <b>agreement</b> between multiple tools. For each instance of a target system, there are two possible classifications: smelly or non-smelly. Therefore, the <b>overall</b> <b>agreement</b> is the number of instances classified in the same category (smelly and non-smelly) by the pair or set of tools, divided {{by the total number of}} instances in the target system. The total number of God Class instances is related to the total number of classes in the system, while the total number of instances for God Method and Feature Envy is related to the total number of methods in the system.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{obtain a}} {{national}} consensus view of suggested criteria for good quality care in induced abortion {{to serve as}} a basis for standards for audit to assess current clinical practice. DESIGN [...] Postal, questionnaire survey assessing consensus agreement with criteria identified from a literature review and refined by an invited panel of four gynaecologists and the gynaecology audit project in Scotland (GAPS) committee. SETTING [...] Scotland. SUBJECTS [...] All 132 practising consultant gynaecologists. MAIN MEASURES [...] <b>Overall</b> level of <b>agreement</b> with each of 20 suggested audit criteria. RESULTS [...] 121 completed questionnaires were received (response rate 92 %), of which 119 were returned in time for analysis; 107 came from consultants who practised abortion routinely and were included in the analysis. Nineteen of 20 suggested criteria were validated by an <b>overall</b> <b>balance</b> of <b>agreement.</b> The most strongly supported criterion (agreement score + 93) was for ascertaining rhesus status of the woman and prophylaxis after abortion, if indicated. The only criterion to elicit a negative agreement score (- 27) was that dilatation and evacuation is the best method of abortion at 12 - 15 weeks' gestation. The ranked and prioritised criteria resulting from this exercise are being used within a national audit project. CONCLUSIONS [...] A postal questionnaire survey among interested clinicians resulted in a good response rate and enabled the audit criteria to be validated and ranked more objectively and among more clinicians, than would have been possible by group discussion...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} whether the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (AEP) is reliable in Turkey. Methods. Three reviewers, two physicians and one nurse each reviewed 196 patient-days concurrently by using the AEP at three hospitals, two of which were teaching hospitals. Inter-reviewer reliability was assessed both for all cases reviewed (<b>overall</b> <b>agreement),</b> and for only those judged inappropriate {{by at least one}} reviewer (specific <b>agreement).</b> In addition, <b>overall</b> <b>agreement</b> between pairs of reviewers was evaluated by the Kappa statistic. Results. The <b>overall</b> <b>agreement</b> between pairs of reviewers was very high: 93. 4 — 95. 9 %, and it was similar between all pairs. The level of <b>overall</b> <b>agreement</b> was highly statistically significant: k = 0. 725 - 0. 833, P< 0. 001. The specific agreement rates ranged from a low of 61. 8 % to a high of 75 %.

40|$|When rating {{questions}} {{are used to}} measure attitudes or values in survey research a researcher might want to control for the effect of <b>overall</b> <b>agreement</b> with the set of items that is rated. The need for controlling for <b>overall</b> <b>agreement</b> arises when the set of items refers to conceptual opposite perspectives, when balanced sets of items are used, or when a researcher is interested in relative preferences rather than <b>overall</b> <b>agreement.</b> In this paper, we introduce a method for filtering out <b>overall</b> <b>agreement</b> when a researcher’s aim is to construct a latent class typology of respondents, that is, a latent-class ordinal regression model with random intercept. With this approach segments in the population are identified that differ in their relative preference of particular items over other items in the set. Examples are given on the concepts of locus of control, gender role attitudes and civil morality. The examples demonstrate that when an <b>overall</b> <b>agreement</b> {{is present in the}} data, the method is able to detect it, {{and at the same time}} allows identifying latent classes of respondents that differ in their relative preference of the items being rated. The use of rating questions in measuring attitudes or values is still very popular.

Between pairs, the average <b>overall</b> <b>agreement</b> between the tools is also mostly in the acceptable range of 75 to 90 % (Hartmann 1977). The AC 1 statistic is also high with most values “Very Good”. By analyzing the results, we concluded that the high agreement {{was due to the}} agreement on non-smelly entities.

METHOD: Four hundred digitalised CXRs from the files of immigrant registration centres were selected and read twice in random order by three readers. The readers had to assess (1) if the picture was normal or abnormal; (2) if an abnormality was suggestive of TB; and (3) if the suspicion of TB needed an immediate examination (potentially smear-positive TB). The intra-observer and <b>overall</b> <b>agreements</b> were expressed as kappa with standard error. RESULTS: Due to losses for technical reasons, 377 of the 400 pictures were analysed. The intra-observer agreement was 0. 39 - 0. 90 for any abnormality, and 0. 60 - 0. 82 for TB needing an urgent examination. The <b>overall</b> <b>agreements</b> were: 0. 55 (all three readers) and 0. 84 (two best readers) for any abnormality, and 0. 64 (all three readers) and 0. 80 (two best readers) for active TB.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The {{research}} {{developed a}} methodology to code and quantify eye movement patterns {{as a function}} of a neuro-linguistic programming strategy elicitation process. Secondarily the research established methodology that identified the degree of consistency among certain certified Neuro-Linguistic Programming Practitioners while they rated eye movements. The study reviewed literature in the field, identified problems relevant to research in NLP, defined and described selected rater strategies, and utilized {{the findings of this study}} to identify areas which are in need of further research. Fifteen Certified Neuro-Linguistic Programming Practitioners viewed a videotape of 10 Oregon State University students who had been videotaped from the eyes upward while spelling 10 words. Practitioners observed eye movements of the videotaped students and these were recorded on Individual Rater Charts, with up to seven possible eye movement notations recorded for each spelling task. Subsequent analysis of these notations provided <b>overall</b> <b>agreement</b> figures among the raters by Eye Movement,¹ a grand mean which reflected agreement among raters over all eye movements and spelling tasks, and Z scores associated with each of the overall ratings by Eye Movement. Greatest agreement among raters was found for the first observed Eye Movement, where <b>overall</b> <b>agreement</b> exceeded the grand mean. <b>Overall</b> <b>agreement</b> for the second observed Eye Movement fell below the grand mean. <b>Overall</b> <b>agreement</b> for subsequent Eye Movements generally increased through Eye Movement 6 and then showed a slight decrease for Eye Movement 7. This increase in agreement for later Eye Movements was largely attributed to what is termed the "NA-effect," which can result in high agreement scores in cases where only one or a few raters note an eye movement while all other raters note no eye movement, and can result in inflated <b>overall</b> <b>agreement</b> scores when the proportion of such cases related to a particular Eye Movement is high in relation to total number of recorded observations associated with the Eye Movement. Anticipated Findings 1, 2 and 3 were not supported by this study, with <b>overall</b> rater <b>agreement</b> lower than predicted for Eye Movements 1 and 2 and higher than predicted for remaining Eye Movements. Anticipated Finding 4 was confirmed by the study, with total number of eye movements observed by all raters for a particular subject found to be inversely correlated with <b>overall</b> <b>agreement</b> among raters in rating that subject. Anticipated Finding 5 was neither supported nor unsupported by the study, since, due to restraints, an appropriate methodology for testing this prediction was not available. Footnote: ¹ An important terminological distinction should be made. Whereas the term 'eye movements' (in all lower case letters) refers to the particular eye movements displayed by individuals performing particular spelling tasks, the term 'Eye Movements' (with first letters capitalized) refers to the ordered set (from 1 through 7) of schema wherein observed eye movements are recorded and ordered. Thus, 'Eye Movement 7,' for example, refers to a schema wherein are recorded particular eye movements observed by raters as being the seventh occurring within a particular spelling task; moreover, since the schema exists even if there is nothing to fill it out, it makes sense to speak about Eye Movement 7 even in cases where no seventh eye movements have been observed...|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} the fire atlas {{corroboration}} indicate that the bigcone Douglas-fir fire-scar record generally reflects the history of widespread fires in surrounding chaparral. <b>Overall</b> <b>agreement</b> between the tree-ring record and the CFHD ranged from 80 % using only growth change data, to 91 % when using fire scar evidence alone. While all three techniques provide a robust validation of the modern fire record, {{each has its own}} strengths and weaknesses. Using just fire-scar data provides the highest level of corroboration and lowest Type I error rate, which suggests that fire-scar evidence, when available, can provide highly accurate spatial and temporal estimates of widespread fire events. However, not all samples record or preserve fire evidence in the form of scars, and this contributes to the slightly higher Type II error rate. Despite a slightly lower percentage of <b>overall</b> <b>agreement</b> (86 %), using growth changes in conjunction with fire scars lowers the Type II error rate. This suggests that growth change data enhance the ability to detect fire evidence when conditions prevent scar formation or preservation. However, a substantially higher Type I error rate is associated with this methodology. Using only growth change information provides the lowest percentage of <b>overall</b> <b>agreement,</b> with a roughly equal chance of obtaining a Type I (9.2 %) or Type II (10.8 %) error.|$|R
