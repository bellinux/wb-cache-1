5|$|After being invaded, a queen may <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> {{to leave}} her nest. If a {{satellite}} has not been established, the queen may usurp another queen in a different nest. Thus not having to invest any valuable resources, the queen can then use these resources on reproducing a new brood.|$|E
5|$|If this dimer existed as a dicarbene, the {{electron}} lone pairs on the carbenic carbon would <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> into close proximity. Presumably the resulting repulsive electrostatic interactions {{would have a}} significant destabilising effect. To avoid this electronic interaction, the carbene units dimerise.|$|E
50|$|Commonly 2 <b>is</b> <b>forcing</b> to 2NT. Then {{pass over}} {{opposing}} 2 <b>is</b> <b>forcing.</b> Here 2 <b>is</b> natural {{but the same}} holds over a conventional call that <b>is</b> <b>forcing.</b> If the convention <b>is</b> a bid <b>forcing</b> only to the next step, such as a Jacoby transfer, then pass <b>is</b> <b>forcing</b> only over a double.|$|R

5|$|Tech's {{selection}} to the Gator Bowl was a controversial one. Because both the Gator Bowl and ACC Championship game {{were held in}} Jacksonville, Georgia Tech would <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to play two games in Jacksonville in four weeks. The team, league, and bowl officials were concerned that fact would hurt attendance.|$|E
5|$|The Court further {{determined}} that states could not <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> {{to participate in}} the Medicaid expansion. ACA withheld all Medicaid funding from states declining {{to participate in the}} expansion. The Court ruled that this withdrawal of funding was unconstitutionally coercive and that individual states had the right to opt out without losing preexisting Medicaid funding.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 142 riders have been {{qualified}} {{in the event}} at these Games. Most {{of them are not}} expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place their riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Many of these riders also sought to conserve themselves for the time trial that was to come. Additionally, if a rider was lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit, he would <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to stop.|$|E

5|$|After {{three runs}} over the city, and with fuel running low {{because of the}} failed fuel pump, they headed for their {{secondary}} target, Nagasaki. Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that Bockscar had insufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and would <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to divert to Okinawa, which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory only six weeks earlier. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose {{of it in the}} ocean if necessary, Ashworth ruled that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured.|$|E
5|$|Against All Odds {{official}} {{began with}} a standard match between Elix Skipper and Petey Williams, who was accompanied by Coach D'Amore. The match ended when Skipper performed a move in which he holds his opponent upside-down and around his back.

Skipper followed by covering Williams for the pinfall.|$|E

5|$|As the two armies {{returned}} to winter quarters, Francis I of France replaced Boutières with François de Vendôme, Count of Enghien, a prince with no experience commanding an army. Francis also sent additional {{troops to the}} Piedmont, including several hundred heavy cavalry, some companies of French infantry from Dauphiné and Languedoc, and a force of quasi-Swiss from Gruyères. In January 1544, Enghien laid siege to Carignano, which was defended by Imperial troops {{under the command of}} Pirro Colonna. The French were of the opinion that d'Avalos would <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to attempt a relief of the besieged city, at which point he could <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> into a battle; but as such pitched battles were viewed as very risky undertakings, Enghien sent Blaise de Lasseran-Massencôme, seigneur de Montluc, to Paris to ask Francis for permission to fight one. Montluc apparently convinced Francis to give his assent—contingent on the agreement of Enghien's captains—over the objections of the Comte de St. Pol, who complained that a defeat would leave France exposed to an invasion by d'Avalos's troops at a time when Charles V and Henry VIII of England were expected to attack Picardy. Montluc, returning to Italy, brought with him nearly a hundred volunteers from among the young noblemen of the court, including Gaspard de Coligny.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1992 Parry favoured a deal with ITV, but thought the network {{should be prepared to}} pay up towards £30 million for live football. At a meeting in January 1992, Dyke made it clear ITV would not be positioned as they were already paying too much for football. He and executive director Trevor East commented on BSkyB's debt and felt the company would <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to increase their borrowing if they were awarded a contract. This did not dissuade Quinton, who urged Murdoch to bid. Quinton even informed Chisholm that there were no bidding rules.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} September 1940, the Tripartite Pact united Japan, Italy and Germany to formalise the Axis Powers.

The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact. Romania would make a major contribution (as did Hungary) to the Axis war against the USSR, partially to recapture territory ceded to the USSR, partially to pursue its leader Ion Antonescu's desire to combat communism.|$|E

On 21 August, the Battle of Scimitar Hill ensued, a disaster for Britain and her allies: Dingle was killed the following day, defending a trench that had earlier been captured.
