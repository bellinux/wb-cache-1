25|$|To {{prevent this}} from happening, a valve is fitted between the {{turbocharger}} and inlet, which vents off the excess air pressure. These {{are known as}} an anti-surge, diverter, bypass, turbo-relief valve, <b>blow-off</b> <b>valve</b> (BOV), or dump valve. It is a pressure relief valve, and is normally operated by the vacuum from the intake manifold.|$|E
60|$|There was, by contrast, {{a curious}} silence when {{the roar of}} steam died away, and the thudding of the big engines below decks sank to a lower pitch. The men who could be spared went down in a body, and toiled for another hour in a frenzy. The fierce Latin blood was up; {{they knew it was}} the last round, and they would not be beaten now. The {{throbbing}} blast which rushed skywards from the <b>blow-off</b> <b>valve</b> when they came up again showed what they had done, and Austin walked aft, singed and blackened, to his winch, with his heart in his mouth. It must be now or never, for it was clear to him that the men were making their last effort, and the boilers would not bear another pound of steam.|$|E
50|$|At a given IP {{compressor}} pressure ratio, {{opening the}} <b>blow-off</b> <b>valve</b> forces the IP compressor entry corrected flow to increase, {{to a point}} where the IP compressor surge margin tends to be better. Effectively, opening the <b>blow-off</b> <b>valve</b> lowers the IP compressor working line. Any flow surplus to that demanded by the HP compressor passes through the <b>blow-off</b> <b>valve</b> into the bypass duct. The <b>blow-off</b> <b>valve</b> is normally only opened at throttled conditions, since it wastes energy.|$|E

50|$|Although T-stages {{usually only}} {{supercharge}} the core stream, some engines do feature a deliberately oversized intermediate pressure (IP) compressor, which compresses both the core flow and {{a proportion of}} the bypass flow. This enhances {{the stability of the}} T-stages during throttling. Where necessary, the alternative is to employ <b>blow-off</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{automotive}} applications, 'boost' {{refers to}} the amount by which intake manifold pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure. This {{is representative of the}} extra air pressure that is achieved over what would be achieved without the forced induction. The level of boost may be shown on a pressure gauge, usually in bar, psi or possibly kPa.The control of turbocharger boost has changed dramatically over the 100-plus years of their use. Modern turbochargers can use wastegates, <b>blow-off</b> <b>valves</b> and variable geometry, as discussed in later sections.|$|R
40|$|The {{pressure}} to which splints were inflated was measured {{to determine whether}} splintage was effective and if vascular complications were likely. The prevalence of their use by the ambulance service was also investigated. The findings indicate that inflatable splints are in common use, and are rarely inflated to pressures likely to cause vascular complications. However, they are extremely inefficient in holding their pressure and rapidly become ineffective as splints. The therapeutic range between effective splinting and risk of complications is narrow and {{it is recommended that}} <b>blow-off</b> <b>valves</b> are incorporated into the manufacture of all such devices...|$|R
50|$|Surge margin can be {{improved}} by adding variable stators to the IP compressor and/or adding a <b>blow-off</b> <b>valve</b> between the IP and HP compressors. The former makes the IP compressor surge line shallower, swinging {{it away from the}} shallow working line, thus improving IP compressor surge margin.|$|E

50|$|Blow-off systemInitially, 4 {{rectangular}} <b>blow-off</b> flaps (<b>valves)</b> were installed; {{later they}} were changed to 8 round flaps. Further during the re-design process, specifically from prototype engine V-07 onwards, this implementation was changed to a different, better controllable system which involved an annular blow-off belt.|$|R
50|$|Safety {{requirements}} {{include the}} use of suspended wire fences, air fences and wooden fences. Air fences are made up of inflated panels installed on the bends. The fence is designed to dissipate energy by allowing an impacted area to compress and transfer air into the rest of the fence through <b>blow-off</b> <b>valves</b> or restriction ports connected to the other sections. They are mandatory for tracks in the British Elite League, Polish Ekstraliga, Speedway Grand Prix and Speedway World Cup. Neutral zones outside the track provide safe run-off areas for riders and their machinery to minimise the potential risk of injury to spectators. The majority of tracks are dedicated to speedway or other sports such as sidecar speedway and banger racing. For larger events, the FIM occasionally sanctions the use of stadiums that install temporary tracks such as the British Grand Prix held at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.|$|R
40|$|Early {{detection}} of pipeline damages has been highlighted in water supply industry. Water pressure change in pipeline {{due to a}} sudden rupture causes pipe to vibrate and the pressure change propagates through the pipeline. From the measurement of pipe vibration the rupture can be detected. In this paper, the field test results and observations are provided for implementing next generation of SCADA system for pipeline rupture detection. Two field tests were performed on real buried plastic and metal pipelines for rupture detection. The rupture was simulated by introducing sudden water pressure drop caused by water <b>blow-off</b> and <b>valve</b> control. The measured acceleration data at the pipe surfaces were analyzed in both time and frequency domain. In time domain, the sudden narrow increase of acceleration amplitude {{was used as an}} indication of rupture event. For the frequency domain analysis, correlation function and the short time Fourier Transform technique were adopted to trace the dominant frequency shift. The success of rupture detection was found to be dependent on several factors. From the frequency analysis, the dominant frequency of metal water pipe was shifted by the water pressure drop, however, it was hard to identify from the plastic pipeline. Also the influence of existing facility such as airvac on pipe vibrations was observed. Finally, several critical lessons learned in the viewpoint of field measurement are discussed in this paper...|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the lighter panels, considerable modifications {{were made to the}} engine, including boring the cylinders out to 98 mm to increase displacement from 3.2 to 3.4 litres, adding an uprated Bosch Motronic fuel injection system, and switching to the ignition setup originally designed for the Porsche 962 race car. A specifically designed turbo system featuring two large turbochargers and twin intercoolers topped the engine work, bringing total output to [...] and 408 lbft Nm of torque at 5950 rpm. The sound from the <b>blow-off</b> <b>valve</b> was also curiously close to the chirp of a canary, helping the name [...] "yellowbird" [...] stick.At the time, Porsche offered the 911 3.2 with a 5-speed manual transmission, but the 930 featured only a 4-speed transmission, chosen {{because it was the only}} unit manufactured by the company that could handle the turbocharged engine's high output. Not content with only four forward gears and unable to satisfactorily modify the 5-speed unit, Ruf chose to use a new five-speed transmission of their own design on the CTR, which also gave them full freedom to customize gear ratios. To ensure absolute control, an upgraded suspension system, 17 inch Ruf Speedline alloy wheels, 330 mm diameter Brembo braking system, and Dunlop's Denloc system performance tires were used.|$|E
5000|$|These did {{not happen}} often, but they were very {{dangerous}} when they did, and generally resulted in severe casualties among the crew and passengers and {{the complete loss of}} the boat. Steamboat boiler explosions had been a common problem on the Mississippi River system well before the steamboats began serious operations in the Pacific Northwest in the 1850s. By 1852, the problem had gotten so bad that Congress enacted a law setting out detailed standards for inspection of steamboats and licensing of officers. [...] Considerable work was done in the 1840s and 1850s to understand what caused boiler explosions, and these came down to many causes, including general wear and tear, inadequate or poorly designed equipment, overworked boilers that were too small for the engines, general lack of engineering skill among boiler operators, and excessive demands for performance from the vessels captain or management. [...] People noticed early on that most of boiler explosions occurred just as steamboats were leaving (or sometimes arriving at) a landing. This was true in two-thirds of the boiler explosions up to 1852. Steam pressure was supposed to be reduced during a landing, but this would {{make it more difficult to}} get off to a fast start, so too often pressure was kept up even though the engines werent running to relieve the pressure by use of the steam generated by the boiler. [...] Under these circumstances, boiler explosions were much more likely. The explosion came, we read again and again in the accounts of these accidents, while [...] "the boat was backing out from the landing," [...] or as [...] "the boat was straightening out after leaving the wharf," [...] or when [...] "the signal to go ahead had just been given," [...] or when [...] "the engine had made but two or three revolutions." ... Careful steam practice required that the during a landing the fires be well checked, the supply pump be kept working, and steam be released through safety or <b>blow-off</b> <b>valve</b> in order to prevent undue accumulation of pressure. Circumstances, however, worked against sound practice, and very often in the flush decades of steamboating these precautions were not observed. To overcome the inertia of the vessel and get it safely away from the shore, perhaps against opposing winds and currents, a good head of steam was needed, and it was better to have too much and not enough.|$|E
40|$|Inflation and {{oesophageal}} pressures {{were recorded}} simultaneously during bag and mask resuscitation of 9 asphyxiated babies. After {{half a minute}} of standard inflation pressures, higher pressures were applied for at least 5 inflations by occluding the <b>blow-off</b> <b>valve.</b> No air entered the oesophagus until a high mean inflation pressure of 5. 4 kPa was exceeded. These findings were confirmed in 4 fresh stillborn babies studied similarly.
