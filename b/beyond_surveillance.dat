40|$|Disability, as {{a product}} of person–environment interaction, is {{particularly}} sensitive to catastrophic events and disasters. Disasters are specific to a physical location, as are the resources needed to handle the af-termath of the event.

GIS provides the capacity to go <b>beyond</b> <b>surveillance</b> and identification of at-risk people with disabilities to actively address the spatial nature of the person–environment interaction. GIS may provide the basis for fur-ther investigation and development of the science of environmental factors in the person–environment interaction.

40|$|Background: Although primary health care, and in particular, general {{practice}} {{will be at}} the frontline in the response to pandemic influenza, there are no frameworks to guide systematic planning for this task or to appraise available plans for their relevance to {{general practice}}. We aimed to develop a framework that will facilitate planning for general practice, and used it to appraise pandemic plans from Australia, England, USA, New Zealand and Canada. Methodology/Principal Findings: We adapted the Haddon matrix to develop the framework, populating its cells through a multi-method study that incorporated the peer-reviewed and grey literature, interviews with general practitioners, practice nurses and senior decision-makers, and desktop simulation exercises. We used the framework to analyse 89 publiclyavailable jurisdictional plans at similar managerial levels in the five countries. The framework identifies four functional domains: clinical care for influenza and other needs, public health responsibilities, the internal environment and the macroenvironment of general practice. No plan addressed all four domains. Most plans either ignored or were sketchy about noninfluenza clinical needs, and about the contribution of general practice to public health <b>beyond</b> <b>surveillance.</b> Collaborations between general practices were addressed in few plans, and inter-relationships with the broader health system, even less frequently. Conclusions: This is the first study to provide a framework to guide general practice planning for pandemic influenza. Th...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Prospective {{surveillance}} of invasive mold diseases (IMDs) in haematology {{patients should be}} standard of care but is hampered {{by the absence of}} a reliable laboratory prompt and the difficulty of manual surveillance. We used a high throughput technology, natural language processing (NLP), to develop a classifier based on machine learning techniques to screen computed tomography (CT) reports supportive for IMDs. Patients and Methods We conducted a retrospective case-control study of CT reports from the clinical encounter and up to 12 -weeks after, from a random subset of 79 of 270 case patients with 33 probable/proven IMDs by international definitions, and 68 of 257 uninfected-control patients identified from 3 tertiary haematology centres. The classifier was trained and tested on a reference standard of 449 physician annotated reports including a development subset (n =  366), from a total of 1880 reports, using 10 -fold cross validation, comparing binary and probabilistic predictions to the reference standard to generate sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver-operating-curve (ROC). Results For the development subset, sensitivity/specificity was 91 % (95 %CI 86 % to 94 %) / 79 % (95 %CI 71 % to 84 %) and ROC area was 0. 92 (95 %CI 89 % to 94 %). Of 25 (5. 6 %) missed notifications, only 4 (0. 9 %) reports were regarded as clinically significant.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{incidence}} of HIV/AIDS in Botswana {{is one of}} the largest in the world taking its toll on many lives and posing developmental challenges to the nation. Nearly 25 % of the population is living with HIV and 14 % are newly infected; AIDS is acknowledged as the major cause of death. Most HIV and AIDS studies have been dominated by surveillance, biomedical and ethical methodologies. These approaches failed to stem the tide of HIV infection because they did not follow-up with the tracking of risky behaviours and the underlying causes of the behaviours. This research scrutinized socio-economic factors in relation to the spread of the epidemic. Available literature showed that little or no attention has been paid to the socio-economic backgrounds in which individuals exist in connection with understanding HIV and AIDS. This study used an economic model of risky sexual behaviour to explore the link between socio-economic status and the practice of HIV self-protective/preventive behaviours in Maruapula, Gaborone, Botswana. The research is vital as it goes <b>beyond</b> <b>surveillance</b> in an effort to establish why the community of the study is susceptible to HIV infection.

40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} strategies of transcultural care emerging from group work in Family Health programs. It is a qualitative study based on Madeleine Leininger’s {{theory of the}} diversity and universality of care. Subjects were health professionals participating in Family Health teams, {{all of whom were}} group coordinators for diabetics and hypertensive patients in basic health care units within a sanitary district of Belo Horizonte. Participative observation and open interviews were used for data collection. Information was collected between June and November 2006, respecting ethical issues. Data interpretation was based on Bardin’s proposal for content analysis. The themes we found were as follows: the group in a transcultural perspective, how the group is structured, work strategies with diabetic and hypertensive groups, the technology of work with groups in a transcultural perspective, and the challenges and advances of group work in Family Health programs. Results indicate that group work is still poorly innovative, with a need to increase multidisciplinarity; current methodologies emphasize a culture of disease and recurrent pedagogic processes such as approaches still focused on the transmission of knowledge. It is worth noting that certain professionals, such as nurses, physical therapists and social workers, practice a differentiated approach centered on the culture of subjects and on the validation of their experiences. The gaze on diabetic and hypertensive patients goes <b>beyond</b> <b>surveillance</b> for medication use, reaching out to those aspects that influence the treatment and control of the disease, within the context in which such patients live. In practice, we were able to recognize and confirm the technical and theoretical difficulties that professionals face when coordinating groups, and to check the belief that resources and logistical support make it possible for groups to become more interesting and effective. Groups were started after these professionals joined the Family Health program, and became a tool to deal with the demands of diabetic and hypertensive patients, becoming an indispensable tool for the daily work of health teams. With its modus operandi the method needs to be recognized, having become a reality in all of the Basic Health Units where, generally speaking, group work is well developed. Group work raises the possibility of transforming teamwork to reach a more horizontal relation between participating agents, meaning that professional power/autonomy needs to be negotiated and subdivided so that knowledge and decisions become shared...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} State and cultural responses to sexual assault in two cultures: Ireland and the United States. As two former colonies of the United Kingdom, the U. S. and Ireland exemplify the complicated dynamic between post-colonial religious nationalism and sexual assault response. My data includes ethnographic research conducted {{over four years}} at two rape crisis centers (RCCs), including participant observation and sixty interviews with RCC management and advocates. I examine how governmental structures maintain economic control over anti-rape movements, which neutralizes the social threat posed by such activism. In both countries, RCC’s dependence on State complexes promotes a limiting definition of victimization that is dependent on institutional involvement. While previous research has attributed the homogenization of the anti-rape movement to neoliberal ideologies, using a transnational approach I find that gendered nationalism is a more appropriate framework from which to understand formal sexual assault response across cultures. The neoliberal U. S. Sexual Assault Response Complex (SARC) uses gender-neutrality and color-blind views of race within criminal-legal and medicalized models. The Irish welfare-capitalist SARC employs essentialized views of gender and race within an apolitical scheme. When rape is viewed as an individual rather than a gendered social problem, sexual abuse and rape culture proliferates within RCCs, taking nationalist patriarchal forms. Previous research conceptualized RCC institutionalization as a reluctant concession requisite to the continuation of services and the anti-rape movement. I find that centers utilize rhetoric of intersectionality and inclusiveness without examining the consequences of oppression within their organizational structures. State solutions for sexual assault require involvement with institutions that have been historically oppressive for people of Color, and ignore the legacy of racialized false accusations upon which U. S. nationalism is built. In Ireland, client-centered services function to maintain the cultural boundaries between who is a client to be served and who is not, which perpetuates racial and citizenship status hierarchies while reifying hegemonic constructions of violence. Diversity marginalizes clients and advocates alike, while supporting narratives of perpetration that protect the State. Rather than changing their organizational missions to align with the SARC transformations, both centers maintained their claims to anti-rape movement work. In so doing, the centers occupy {{the space of a}} social movement while marginalizing the possibilities for social change. As a result, expansions of State power move <b>beyond</b> <b>surveillance</b> into the prosecution of victims of sexual assault. I propose the development of transnational anti-rape justice models to address the complexity of the eradication of sexual abuse...|$|E
