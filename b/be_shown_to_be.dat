5|$|The Peano axioms can be {{augmented}} {{with the}} operations of addition and multiplication and the usual total (linear) ordering on N. The respective functions and relations are constructed in set theory or second-order logic, and can <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unique using the Peano axioms.|$|E
5|$|The axioms may be {{weakened}} {{to assert}} only {{the existence of}} a left identity and left inverses. Both can <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> actually two-sided, so the resulting definition is equivalent to the one given above.|$|E
5|$|Another sauropod of the Nemegt-Formation, Nemegtosaurus, {{is known}} {{only from a}} skull. Opisthocoelicaudia, on the other hand, lacks both the skull and neck, precluding a direct {{comparison}} and leading to suspicions that it may represent a synonym of Nemegtosaurus. According to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the oldest name has priority over younger synonyms – if Opisthocoelicaudia would <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a synonym of Nemegtosaurus, the name Nemegtosaurus would remain valid while Opisthocoelicaudia would become invalid.|$|E

The {{problem of}} {{recognizing}} whether {{a subset of}} attributes <b>is</b> a pseudo-intent <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> coNP-hard, which together with the previous results means that this problem is coNP-complete. Recognizing an essential intent <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> NP-complete and recognizing the lectically largest pseudo-intent <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> coNP-hard. ...|$|R

5|$|The Gaussian {{integers}} {{are complex}} {{numbers of the}} form α=u+vi, where u and v are ordinary integers and i is the square root of negative one. By defining an analog of the Euclidean algorithm, Gaussian integers can <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> uniquely factorizable, by the argument above. This unique factorization is helpful in many applications, such as deriving all Pythagorean triples or proving Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares. In general, the Euclidean algorithm is convenient in such applications, but not essential; for example, the theorems can often be proven by other arguments.|$|E
5|$|The world's {{languages}} can {{be grouped}} into language families consisting of languages {{that can be}} shown to have common ancestry. Linguists recognize many hundreds of language families, although some of them can possibly be grouped into larger units as more evidence becomes available and in-depth studies are carried out. At present, there are also dozens of language isolates: languages that cannot <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> related to any other languages in the world. Among them are Basque, spoken in Europe, Zuni of New Mexico, Purépecha of Mexico, Ainu of Japan, Burushaski of Pakistan, and many others.|$|E

25|$|For example, the {{following}} algorithm {{is a direct}} implementation to compute the function A(x) = (x−1) / (exp(x−1) − 1) which is well-conditioned at 1.0, however it can <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> numerically unstable and lose up to half the significant digits carried by the arithmetic when computed near 1.0.|$|E
25|$|None of the {{decompression}} {{models can}} <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an accurate {{representation of the}} physiological processes, although interpretations of the mathematical models have been proposed which correspond with various hypotheses.

50|$|Again, this 2-size {{algorithm}} <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strongly-competitive. The generalized k-size algorithm which <b>is</b> similar <b>to</b> the 2-size algorithm <b>is</b> then <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> O(log)-competitive.|$|R
40|$|Upward {{combustion}} of 316 {{stainless steel}} (SS) rods is discussed and a combustion model is presented. The effects of varying oxygen pressure and rod diameter on the rate limiting processes for combustion of 316 SS are evaluated. The rate-limiting steps for combustion up 316 SS rods <b>are</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{dependent on the}} incorporation and mass transport of oxygen in the molten mass, and heat transfer between the molten mass and rod. Both these rate-limiting steps <b>are</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dependent on rod diameter. Small (d/r/ = 0. 051 cm) 316 SS rods <b>are</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dependent on convective heat transfer, and larger rods (d/r/ not less than 0. 32 cm) <b>are</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dependent on oxygen incorporation and mass transport in the molten mass...|$|R

25|$|A behaviorist {{psychologist}} might (operationally) define {{intelligence as}} that score obtained {{on a specific}} IQ test (e.g., the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale test) by a human subject. The theoretical underpinnings of the WAIS would be completely ignored.

40|$|Criteria {{are found}} which {{classify}} Schatten class membership for operators on the Hardy space {{in terms of}} their action on the reproducing kernels and their derivatives. The Hilbert–Schmidt conditions <b>are</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> both necessary and sufficient for arbitrary operators. For other Schatten classes, the criteria <b>are</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> either necessary or sufficient for arbitrary operators, depending upon the exponent of the class.

25|$|The {{computational}} {{complexity of}} tic-tac-toe {{depends on how}} it is generalized. A natural generalization is to m,n,k-games: played on an m by n board with winner being {{the first player to}} get k in a row. It is immediately clear that this game can be solved in DSPACE(mn) by searching the entire game tree. This places it in the important complexity class PSPACE.

25|$|At {{some point}} between 1643 and early 1645, Dubhaltach {{moved to the}} town of Galway, where in April 1645 he {{completed}} a transcription of the seventy-page historical-genealogical compilation called Seanchas Síl Ír. His source can <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the late 14th-century manuscript called The Book of Uí Mhaine (also known as the Book of Ó Dubhagáin). Dubhaltach's very faithful transcript is especially valuable as four of the original fourteen folios have since been lost.|$|E
25|$|Scientists at Chugai Pharmaceuticals {{discovered}} an erythromycin-derived motilin agonist called mitemcinal that {{is believed to}} have strong prokinetic properties (similar to erythromycin) but lacking antibiotic properties. Erythromycin is commonly used off-label for gastric motility indications such as gastroparesis. If mitemcinal can <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an effective prokinetic agent, it would represent a significant advance in the gastrointestinal field, as treatment with this drug would not carry the risk of unintentional selection for antibiotic-resistant bacteria.|$|E
40|$|Some spontaneously {{occurring}} bacteriophage T 4 mutants (far mutants) <b>were</b> able <b>to</b> form plaques in {{the presence}} of concentrations of folate analogues that completely inhibit plaque formation by wild-type phage T 4.

40|$|AbstractCertain {{infinite}} Thue systems over {{a finite}} alphabet are studied, in particular, systems S⊆∑∗×(∑∪{e}) such that for each aϵ∑∪{e}, the set {u| (u,a) ϵS} is a context-freelanguage. The syntactic structure of sets of ancestors and sets of descendants is considered, {{as well as}} that of unions of congruence classes, taken over (infinite) context-free languages or regular sets. The common descendant problem <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tractable while the common ancestor problem <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> undecidable (even for finite systems). The word problem for confluent systems of this type <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tractable.

25|$|One can {{represent}} any partial order {{as a family}} of sets, such that x < y in the partial order whenever the set corresponding to x is {{a subset of the}} set corresponding to y.

25|$|The {{cross product}} only exists in three and seven {{dimensions}} {{as one can}} always define a multiplication on a space of one higher dimension as above, and this space can <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a normed division algebra. By Hurwitz's theorem such algebras only exist in one, two, four, and eight dimensions, so the cross product must be in zero, one, three or seven dimensions. The products in zero and one dimensions are trivial, so non-trivial cross products only exist in three and seven dimensions.|$|E
25|$|By {{combining}} the Adair treatment with the Hill plot, one {{arrives at the}} modern experimental definition of cooperativity (Hill, 1985, Abeliovich, 2005). The resultant Hill coefficient, or more correctly {{the slope of the}} Hill plot as calculated from the Adair Equation, can <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the ratio between the variance of the binding number to the ratio of the binding number in an equivalent system of non-interacting binding sites. Thus, the Hill coefficient defines cooperativity as a statistical dependence of one binding site on the state of other site(s).|$|E
