Both the Milky Way {{and one of our}} nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the variation in}} bond strength in corroding specimens, before surface cracks are visible. Reinforced concrete specimens containing 16 mm and 12 mm diameter <b>bars</b> <b>at</b> covers of 1, 2 and 3 times bar diameter, with and without confinement, were subjected to accelerated corrosion. Bond strength is seen to increase {{during the early stages}} of corrosion (pre external cracking) for confined <b>bars</b> <b>at</b> all covers and unconfined <b>bars</b> <b>at</b> 3 times cover. However, while 16 mm bars, 1 and 2 times cover showed similar behaviour the 12 mm bars displayed a decrease in bond once corrosion was initiated...|$|R

Tyler was erroneously {{admitted to the}} Virginia <b>bar</b> <b>at</b> the premature age of 19—the admitting judge neglected to ask his age. By this time his father was serving as Governor of Virginia (1808–1811), and the young Tyler started a practice in Richmond, the state capital. In 1813 he purchased Woodburn plantation, and resided there until 1821.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little {{had been changed}} since the 17th century in terms of legal {{education}} or practice, except that students were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to the Bar. In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the call to the Bar was introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who had been called to the <b>Bar</b> <b>at</b> the Inn transferred to others.|$|E

5|$|Extensive but {{superficial}} {{damage was}} caused by an IRA bomb that exploded close to a snack <b>bar</b> <b>at</b> approximately 1:10pm on 10 September 1973, injuring eight people. A similar explosive had detonated 50 minutes earlier at King's Cross. The Metropolitan Police had received a three-minute warning and were unable to evacuate the station completely, but British Transport Police evacuated much of the area just before the explosion. In 1974, the mentally ill Judith Ward confessed to the bombing and was convicted of this and other crimes despite the evidence against her being highly suspect and Ward retracting her confessions. She was acquitted in 1992, and the culprit has not been found.|$|E
5|$|Hogg {{was called}} to the <b>bar</b> <b>at</b> the Michaelmas term in 1817, and often practised law in Northumberland and Durham. He {{frequently}} visited his family, with whom he was then on good terms. His reserved personality {{proved to be a}} hindrance to his career, and he remained dependent on financial assistance from his father. He continued studying Greek, and an article that he wrote on Apuleius was published in the third issue of The Liberal in 1822. A paper that he submitted for the fourth issue was rejected, causing him to resent the editors.|$|E
5|$|In London, Bond learns his {{objective}} is determining how Goldfinger smuggles gold internationally.

Bond follows him to Switzerland, where Tilly, Jill's sister, makes an unsuccessful attempt at revenge by firing a rifle at Goldfinger.|$|E

5|$|Kid Icarus is {{an action}} {{platformer}} with role-playing elements. The player controls the protagonist Pit through two-dimensional levels, which contain monsters, obstacles and items. Pit's primary weapon is a bow with an unlimited supply of arrows {{that can be}} upgraded with three collectable power items: the guard crystal shields Pit from enemies, the flaming arrows hit multiple targets, and the holy bow increases {{the range of the}} arrows. These upgrades will work only if Pit's health is high enough. The game keeps track of the player's score, and increases Pit's health <b>bar</b> <b>at</b> the end of a level if enough points were collected.|$|E

5|$|News of de Barras' {{departure}} led the British {{to realise}} that the Chesapeake was the probable {{target of the}} French fleets. By 31 August Graves had moved his ships over the <b>bar</b> <b>at</b> New York harbour. Taking command of the combined fleet, now 19 ships, Graves sailed south, and arrived {{at the mouth of}} the Chesapeake on 5 September. His progress was slow; the poor condition of some of the West Indies ships (contrary to claims by Admiral Hood that his fleet was fit for a month of service) necessitated repairs en route. Graves was also concerned about some ships in his own fleet; Europe in particular had difficulty manoeuvring. The squadrons' clash started with Marseillois exchanging shots with the 64-gun HMS Intrepid, under Captain Anthony Molloy.|$|E

5|$|On September18, a heavy {{northern}} gale wrecked {{the ship}} Smoker on the <b>bar</b> <b>at</b> Tampico, Tamaulipas, in Mexico. On September19, two ships were capsized, the John Howell and the J.K.L. After the latter sunk, 10people drowned, including the captain. No specific locations {{are known for}} these shipwrecks so no complete track for this storm is known, but it {{was active in the}} western Gulf of Mexico beginning on September18. The storm made landfall early on September19 in a rural area of Tamaulipas to the north of Tampico. Based on John Kaplan and Mark DeMaria's inland decay model created in 1995, it is estimated that the cyclone dissipated several hours later.|$|E
