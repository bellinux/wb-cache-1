5|$|MacFarlane {{developed}} a Family Guy spin-off called The Cleveland Show, {{which focuses on}} the character of Cleveland Brown and his family. The idea for the show originated from a suggestion by Family Guy writer and voice of Cleveland, Mike Henry. Fox ordered 22 episodes and the series first aired on September 27, 2009. The show, which was picked up to air a first season consisting of 22 episodes, was picked up by Fox for a second season, consisting of 13 episodes, bringing the total number to 35 episodes. The announcement was made on May 3, 2009 before the first season even premiered. Due to strong ratings, Fox picked up the <b>back</b> <b>nine</b> episodes of season 2, making a 22-episode season and bringing the total episode count of the show to 44. The series ended on May 19, 2013, with a total of 4 seasons and 88 episodes, and the character of Cleveland returned to Family Guy in the episode He's Bla-ack!. This is the only animated series created by MacFarlane that does not have him voicing the main character.|$|E

25|$|Hogan {{remains the}} only golfer in history to win the Masters, U.S. Open, and British Open in the same {{calendar}} year (1953). His 14-under par at the 1953 Masters set a record that stood for 12 years, and he remains one of just 10 golfers (Jack Nicklaus, Raymond Floyd, Ben Crenshaw, Tiger Woods, David Duval, Phil Mickelson, Charl Schwartzel, Jordan Spieth and Justin Rose) to have recorded such a low score in the tournament. In 1967, at age 54, Hogan shot a record 30 on the <b>back</b> <b>nine</b> at the Masters; the record stood until 1992.|$|E
25|$|As mounted, the {{vertebral}} column of E. annectens includes twelve neck, twelve <b>back,</b> <b>nine</b> sacral, {{and at least}} thirty tail vertebrae. The limb bones were longer and more lightly built than those of other hadrosaurids of comparable size. E. annectens had a distinctive pelvis, based on the proportions and form of the pubis bone. E. annectens, like other hadrosaurids, could move both on two legs and on four legs. It probably preferred to forage for food on four legs, but ran on two. Henry Fairfield Osborn used the skeletons in the American Museum of Natural History to portray both quadrupedal and bipedal stances for E. annectens.|$|E

25|$|Woods {{started the}} 2008 season with an eight-stroke {{victory at the}} Buick Invitational. The win marked his 62nd PGA Tour victory, tying him with Arnold Palmer for fourth on the all-time list. This marked his sixth victory at the event, the sixth time he has begun the PGA Tour season with a victory, and his third PGA Tour win in a row. The {{following}} week, he was trailing by four strokes going into {{the final round of}} the Dubai Desert Classic, but made six birdies on the <b>back</b> <b>nine</b> for a dramatic one-stroke victory. He took home his 15th World Golf Championships event at the Accenture Match Play Championship with a record-breaking 8 & 7 victory in the final.|$|E
25|$|High {{winds and}} {{scattered}} showers pushed the scoring average {{more than two}} strokes higher with just seven sub-par rounds on Friday, compared to fifty on Thursday. The conditions were the worst during the morning, and the round's best of 68 belonging to co-leader Steve Marino and Ross Fisher, tied for fourth place. Retief Goosen shot an even par 70 to share fourth. Veteran Tom Watson continued his excellent performance; he struggled through the front nine, but holed long putts at the 16th and 18th, as he made three birdies on the <b>back</b> <b>nine</b> to tie Marino for the lead at 135 (âˆ’5). Nearly sixty, Watson looked to become the oldest winner of a major championship by over a decade.|$|E
25|$|In November 2011, Kaymer won {{his first}} WGC title at the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai, China. He entered the final round {{trailing}} Fredrik Jacobson by five strokes, then shot a final round 9-under 63 to take the title by three strokes from Jacobson. After parring his opening six holes, Kaymer birdied nine of the remaining twelve, with four straight birdies {{at the start of}} the <b>back</b> <b>nine.</b> This was the biggest comeback win ever in the history of the WGC events, and the lowest final round by a WGC winner, topping a 64 set by Hunter Mahan in 2010. Kaymer became the tenth player to have won both a major and a WGC event, and the win took him back to world number four.|$|E

25|$|In 1934, Benning Bridge was rebuilt as a {{beam bridge}} on {{concrete}} piers. That same year, the Corps of Engineers transferred ownership of Anacostia Park, Kingman and Heritage islands, and Kingman Lake to the National Park Service. The Park Service also proposed extending East Capitol Street onto the reclaimed land {{and then over}} the Anacostia River, and building a complex of sports stadiums, an armory, an outdoor theater, a swimming pool, an ice skating rink, and athletic fields on the flats. Legislation proposing a bridge across Kingman Island and stadium complex in Anacostia Park was submitted to Congress, which did not act on the proposals. The first nine holes of Langston Golf Course were built on {{the north end of}} Kingman Island in 1939, and the <b>back</b> <b>nine</b> on the lake's western shore in 1955.|$|E
25|$|Woods {{returned}} to competitive golf four weeks later {{to defend his}} title at The Memorial Tournament. He made the cut {{and went on to}} finish T19, his worst finish in that tournament since 2002. His next competitive tournament began June 17 at the U.S. Open held at Pebble Beach, the site of his 2000 win by a record 15 shots. After a relatively unspectacular performance through the first two rounds, Woods showed signs of his pre-2010 form, as he managed a <b>back</b> <b>nine</b> 31 en route to shooting a five-under-par 66 on Saturday, which would tie for the low round of the tournament and put him back into contention. However, he was unable to mount a charge on Sunday, despite the collapse of 54-hole leader Dustin Johnson, and went on to finish the tournament at three-over-par and in a tie for fourth place, repeating his top-5 result at the 2010 Masters Tournament.|$|E
25|$|Faldo won {{his second}} major {{championship}} at the 1989 Masters. Starting his fourth round five shots off the lead held by Ben Crenshaw, Faldo's {{final round of}} 65 (consisting of eight birdies, nine pars and one bogey) was the low round of the tournament and enabled him {{to get into a}} playoff with Scott Hoch. Displaying some brilliant putting in his final round, Faldo holed a 50-foot birdie putt on the first hole and followed this up with birdies on the 2nd, 4th and 7th holes. On the <b>back</b> <b>nine,</b> Faldo holed birdie putts of 12 feet at the 13th, 5 feet at the 14th, 15 feet (with an 8-foot break) at the 16th, and 30 feet at the 17th. On the first hole of the ensuing sudden-death playoff, Hoch missed a 2-foot par putt that would have won him the tournament. On the 2nd playoff hole, amid the growing evening darkness, Faldo holed a 25-foot birdie putt to win the tournament.|$|E

In {{the final round of}} the 2012 AT Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, Mickelson rallied from six shots back, winning the tournament by two strokes with a final round score of 8-under 64 and a four-round total of 269. The win marked his 40th career victory on the PGA Tour. The following week at Riviera Country Club, Mickelson lost the Northern Trust Open in a three-way playoff. He had held the lead or a share of it from day one until the <b>back</b> <b>nine</b> on Sunday when Bill Haas posted the clubhouse lead at seven under par. Mickelson holed a 27-foot birdie putt on the final regulation hole to force a playoff alongside Haas and Keegan Bradley. Haas however won the playoff with a 40-foot birdie putt on the second playoff hole. The second-place finish moved Mickelson back into the world's top 10.|$|E
25|$|He was {{the only}} player in the 20th century to win the British Open in three {{different}} decades. His first win, as a 23-year-old in 1959 at Muirfield, came after he double-bogeyed the last hole. In 1974, {{he became one of}} the few golfers in history to win two major championships in the same season. Player last won the U.S. Masters in 1978, when he started seven strokes behind 54-hole leader Hubert Green entering the final round, and won by one shot with birdies at seven of the last 10 holes for a <b>back</b> <b>nine</b> 30 and a final round 64. One week later, Player again came from seven strokes back in the final round to win the Tournament of Champions. In 1984, at the age of 48 Player nearly became the oldest ever major champion, finishing in second place behind Lee Trevino at the PGA Championship. And in gusty winds at the 1998 Masters, he became the oldest golfer ever to make the cut, breaking the 25-year-old record set by Sam Snead. Player credited this feat to his dedication to the concept of diet, health, practice and golf fitness.|$|E

500|$|CBS has {{televised}} the Masters in the United States {{every year}} since 1956, when it used six cameras and covered only the final four holes. Tournament coverage of the first eight holes did not begin until 1993 because of resistance from the tournament organizers, but by 2006, more than 50 cameras were used. Chairman Jack Stephens felt that the <b>back</b> <b>nine</b> was always more [...] "compelling", increased coverage would increase the need for sponsorship spending, and that broadcasting the front nine of the course on television would cut down on attendance and television viewership for the tournament. USA Network added first- and second-round coverage in 1982. The Masters has been broadcast every year in high-definition television since 2000, {{one of the first}} golf tournaments to ever hold that distinction. In 2008, ESPN replaced USA as broadcaster of early-round coverage.

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "just about perfect", writing: [...] "this {{was one of}} those high-energy episodes that narrowed its song focus [...] and found a just-right mix of cynicism and optimism, of banal reality and glam performance." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal commented: [...] "It's been a long premiere season of ups and downs, and this last show is a warm embrace that â€” letâ€™s face it â€” you just don't want to let go." [...] The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson deemed the episode [...] "awesome", observing: [...] "While it was light on the usual humor, it was heavy on emotion, and I think that's ideal for a season finale. Glee ended its freshman season with a real wallop that took a couple of unexpected turns before pulling nicely into a satisfying finish." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded the episode [...] "A-", deeming it among the best of the entire season. He felt that: [...] "On its own, 'Journey to Regionals' is a fantastic episode of Glee. As a capper to the season, it mostly works." [...] While VanDerWerff had some issues with the episode, including Shelby's sudden decision to adopt Beth, he summarized that: [...] "for once in this <b>back</b> <b>nine,</b> the good stuff absolutely overwhelms the stupid stuff." [...] Jessica Derschowitz of CBS News felt that: [...] "Glee wrapped up on a high note, leaving some of the season's less-appealing plotlines behind and heading towards the promise of more performances and more amazing Sue Sylvester one-liners next season." ...|$|E
