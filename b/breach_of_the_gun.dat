60|$|Silvermane's ears shot up and Wolf barked. Two gray deer loped out of {{a thicket}} and turned inquisitively. Reaching for his rifle Hare threw back the lever, but the action clogged, it rasped {{with the sound of}} {{crunching}} sand, and the cartridge could not be pressed into the chamber or ejected. He fumbled about the <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> and his brow clouded.|$|E
60|$|To {{the dying}} pirate the jovial words and rollicking tune {{made his own}} fate seem the harsher, {{but there was no}} {{softening}} in his venomous blue eyes. Copley Banks had brushed away the priming of the gun, and had sprinkled fresh powder over the touch-hole. Then he had taken up the candle and cut it to the length of about an inch. This he placed upon the loose powder at the <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun.</b> Then he scattered powder thickly over the floor beneath, so that when the candle fell at the recoil it must explode the huge pile in which the three drunkards were wallowing.|$|E
5000|$|Barry was 27 years old, and {{a private}} in the 1st Battalion, The Royal Irish Regiment, British Army during the Second Boer War when the {{following}} deed took place on 7/8 January 1901 at Monument Hill, South Africa, {{for which he was}} (posthumously) awarded the VC: During the night attack on the 7th and 8th January, 1901, on Monument Hill, Private Barry, although surrounded and threatened by the Boers at the time, smashed <b>the</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maxim <b>gun,</b> thus rendering: it useless to its captors, and it was in doing this splendid act for his country that he met his death.|$|R
6000|$|Then I {{remembered that}} the {{handkerchief}} had last been used to rub out <b>the</b> fouled <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> a <b>gun.</b> <b>The</b> girl looked at <b>the</b> blur <b>of</b> red and black which resulted from my efforts, and frowned, then broke out into a rippling laugh. [...] "Beatrice said your ways were refreshingly primitive, and I think she was right," [...] she said.|$|R
5000|$|In England and Wales, <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{peace is}} not an offence, {{in the sense that}} it is not {{punishable}} either by a fine or imprisonment either at statute or common law and nor do proceedings for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peace give rise to any conviction. [...] In England and Wales, constables (or other persons) are permitted to arrest a person to [...] "prevent a further <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peace" [...] which allows for the police or the public to arrest a person before a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peace has occurred. This is permitted when it is reasonable to believe should the person remain, that they would continue with their course of conduct and that a <b>Breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peace would occur.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} bolt actions {{which contain}} {{the firing pin}} centered in the bolt, the Palmer's bolt was machined from a solid block of tubular metal, which had screw type lands and grooves to lock the bolt in place via a short stubby handle. The hammer of the weapon (located {{on the right side}} of the receiver like all other percussion fired rifles of the time period) holds the firing pin at the tip. A tooled, milled slot is visible on the head of the bolt canted toward the right side allows a slight opening for the firing pin atop the hammer to strike the rim-fired cartridge, usually the 56-50 rim fire. The bolt was designed for single shot action, the cartridges were loaded one at a time. The design was quite revolutionary, and was seen at the time as a simple breach modification to weapons of the time period to accept metallic cartridges instead of the traditional powder, ball, wad, ram rod and percussion cap which consumed time during loading procedures. The designer understood that gunsmiths could hopefully modify current percussion rifles from the <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> in the same way flintlocks were modified to percussion using a relatively simple process. The downfall of the rifle was the positioning of the hammer where the firing pin hits the rim of the cartridge, and the small space on the bolt where the two parts meet with the bullet rim when the trigger is pulled.|$|E
