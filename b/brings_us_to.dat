5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
25|$|Each hour of {{this day}} is the new {{suffering}} and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the Savior. And the echo of this suffering is already heard in every word of our worship service – unique and incomparable both {{in the power of}} tenderness and feeling and in the depth of the boundless compassion for the suffering of the Savior. The Holy Church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the Lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the Garden of Gethsemane up to the crucifixion on Golgotha. Taking us back through the past centuries in thought, the Holy Church <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the foot of the cross of Christ erected on Golgotha, and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the Savior.|$|E

The next day, when {{a picture of him}} his mother had taken the previous Christmas showing them smiling together appeared in the Jackson Daily News and Vicksburg Evening Post, editorials and letters to the editor were printed expressing shame at the people who had caused Till's death. One read, [...] "Now is the time for every citizen who loves the state of Mississippi to 'Stand up and be counted' before hoodlum white trash <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> destruction."

500|$|Over the years, Nielsen {{wrote the}} music for over 290 songs and hymns, most of them for verses and poems by {{well-known}} Danish authors such as N. F. S. Grundtvig, Ingemann, Poul Martin Møller, Adam Oehlenschläger and Jeppe Aakjær. In Denmark, {{many of them are}} still popular today both with adults and children. They are regarded as [...] "the most representative part of the country's most representative composer's output". In 1906, Nielsen had explained the significance of such songs to his countrymen:With certain melodic inflections we Danes unavoidably think of the poems of, for example, Ingemann, Christian Winther or Drachmann, and we often seem to perceive the smell of Danish landscapes and rural images in our songs and music.

Rajasekhar S of Cinemalead also gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and called it [...] "classy and brilliant", stating [...] "Vikram K Kumar has packed the movie {{in such a way}} that the audience never get bored.

She {{also stated that}} [...] "Ariana Grande's new video takes us {{to the end of}} the world, and <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the edge of our seats". In response to similarities between the Grande video and the music video accompanying Australian band SAFIA's single [...] "You Are the One", Grande and Landis were accused of intellectual property theft. The controversy centered on similarities in the shared apocalyptic themes and stylistic format (a single, tracking shot) as well as parallels in the beginning of both videos (where a female protagonist exits a vehicle despite the protests of the male driver) and final shot (a lover's embrace as the world comes to an end around them). Members of the band described the similarities as an instance of when [...] "big labels and/or big film firms steal ideas from small independent creatives who are trying really hard to make something different for a change". Despite acknowledging similarities between the two videos, Landis denied that his ideas are stolen from them and commented that both music videos had much in common with a third earlier music video by Perth group Injured Ninja.|$|E

2500|$|The founder’s {{inscription}} {{was written}} on the inner west wall, above {{the entrance to the}} church, covering the entire width of the lintel. The text was written in four rows on the white basis with black letters of unequal size and it says that several persons participated in the construction and painting process of church. The text begins with trinity invocation on Church Slavonic language: “Izvolenijem Otca I savršenijem Sina I sapospešenijem”, which was normal for the founding labels of the Serbian and Bulgarian people in the Middle Ages. At the start, before the first word was preceded a small painted cross saved partially (lat. Invocatio symbolica) which in the Middle Ages [...] usually began and ended the inscriptions of this kind. Strangeness of founders inscription in Staničenje is that a mention of the Bulgarian Emperor <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the name of Vidin master Balaur.

2500|$|As The Shooting {{was never}} {{released}} theatrically, and had sparse television showings, it initially {{had a very}} limited core of fans. Those critics who did manage to view the film were extremely enthusiastic, and generally found it superior to Hellman's companion western, Ride in the Whirlwind. Danny Peary in Cult Movies (1981), after admitting that he had difficulties with the [...] "puzzling" [...] climax, noted [...] "But while the end may ask more questions than it answers, the exciting journey that <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> this point {{is one of the}} most rewarding sequences in the history of westerns." [...] Leonard Maltin said it was an [...] "...ultimately powerful film with an offbeat performance by Nicholson as a hired gun... and an incredible, unexpected finale." [...] David Pirie in Time Out wrote, [...] "Probably the first Western which really deserves to be called existential... Hellman builds remorselessly on the atmosphere and implications of the 'quest' until it assumes a terrifying importance in itself... What Hellman has done is to take the basic tools of the Western, and use them, without in anyway diluting or destroying their power, as the basis for a Kafkaesque drama." [...] Phil Hardy's The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: The Western notes that [...] "Hellman's calculated style, replete with disorientating close-ups and strange moments... confirm the detached fatalism of his story. This is a marvelous film." [...] James Monaco's The Movie Guide described the film as [...] "ighly effective, playing with various levels of character and ideas... it is a fine western stylization that should not be missed." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum has referred to the film as the first acid western, and cited it as an inspiration for Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man. The Shooting has a 100% favorable rating on the [...] "Critical Tomatometer" [...] at the Rotten Tomatoes website.|$|E
2500|$|In A.D.1894, Sri Yukteswar {{wrote the}} book Kaivalya Darsanam, popularly known as The Holy Science, {{presenting}} a very convincing calculations of the Yugas. According to Sri Yukteswar, Kali Yuga consists of 1200 years (in human terms), wherein 100 years of transition into the yuga takes place at either end with 1000 years of Kali in between. In The Holy Science, Sri Yukteswar states, [...] "The astronomers and astrologers who calculate the almanacs have been guided by wrong annotations of certain Sanskrit scholars (such as Kulluka Bhatta) of the dark age of Kali Yuga, and now maintain that the length of Kali Yuga is 432,000 years of which 4994 have (in A.D. 1894) passed away, leaving 427,006 years still remaining. A dark prospect! and fortunately one not true." [...] Due to the misinterpretation, the scholars decided that Daiva Yuga (or Divine Years) were not human but heavenly years, thereby leading to a wrong conclusion. The descending Kali Yuga ended in A.D. 499, the period around which marked the most chaotic and ignorant one in human history. As per Sri Yukteswar, mankind is in the ascending arc of the Daiva Yugas, and at present in Dwapara Yuga, with the ascending Kali Yuga having ended properly in A.D. 1699. He states, [...] "From A.D. 499 onward, the sun began to advance toward the grand centre, and the intellect of man started to gradually develop. During the 1100 years of the Ascending Kali Yuga, which <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> A.D. 1599, the human intellect was so dense {{that it could not}} comprehend the electricities, Sukshmabhuta, the fine matters of creation.". A.D. 1700 to A.D. 1900 were a 200 year transition period toward Dwapara Yuga, which began properly in A.D. 1900.|$|E
