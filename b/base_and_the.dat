5|$|The castle {{was built}} using the trace italienne style popular during the seventeenth century; its floor has a {{geometric}} design, and bastions {{are the main}} defensive elements. However, unlike other permanent bastioned fortifications, its defensive walls were designed as two sections: {{the lower part of}} the wall is vertical (perpendicular to the <b>base)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> upper part, above the string course, is inclined inwards. This design makes the fort unique in Venezuela; in most castles, the lower portion of the walls inclines outwards at the <b>base</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> upper parts are vertical (perpendicular to the base).|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to connect a floating source between the two bases, but {{it is necessary to}} ensure paths for the biasing base currents. In the case of galvanic source, only one resistor has to be connected between one of <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ground. The biasing current will enter directly this <b>base</b> <b>and</b> indirectly (through <b>the</b> input source) the other one. If the source is capacitive, two resistors have to be connected between <b>the</b> two <b>bases</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ground to ensure different paths for the base currents.|$|R

5|$|Carmarthenshire {{is mainly}} an {{agricultural}} county, {{apart from the}} southeastern part which at one time was heavily industrialised with coal mining, steel-making and tin-plating. In {{the north of the}} county the woollen industry was very important in the 18th century. Nowadays the economy of the county depends on agriculture, forestry, fishing and tourism. With the decline in its industrial <b>base</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> low profitability of the livestock sector, Carmarthenshire is economically one of the worst-performing regions in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Clathrus ruber is {{the type}} species of the genus Clathrus, and {{is part of the}} group of Clathrus species known as the Laternoid series. Common {{features}} uniting this group include the vertical arms of the receptacle (fruit body) that are not joined together at the <b>base,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> spongy structure of the receptacle. According to a molecular analysis published in 2006, out of the about 40 Phallales species used in the study, C.ruber is most closely related to Aseroe rubra, Clathrus archeri, Laternea triscapa, and Clathrus chrysomycelinus.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, the {{population}} of the base declined due to the possible closure of the <b>base</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> draw down in personnel from the Vietnam War.

5|$|In 1954, Grand Forks {{was chosen}} as the site for an Air Force base. Grand Forks Air Force Base brought {{thousands}} of new jobs and residents to the community.

With construction of federal highways, during the postwar years residential and business development became suburbanized, spreading to new areas as land was available. Interstate 29 was built on the western side of the city, and two enclosed shopping malls – South Forks Plaza and Columbia Mall – were built on the south side.|$|E

The light source used was originally kerosene lamps, which upgraded in 1912 to a Dalén light, upgraded again to electric light in 1960, automated in 1973, and finally converted to solar power in 1990. In 1991 the last caretaker withdrew from the premises and very soon after the keeper's cottages were vandalised and burned.|$|E
