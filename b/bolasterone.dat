50|$|Calusterone (INN, USAN) (brand names Methosarb, Riedemil; former {{developmental}} code names NSC-88536, U-22550), {{also known}} as 7β,17α-dimethyltestosterone, is an orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) that is used as an antineoplastic agent. It is a 17α-alkylated AAS similar in structure to <b>bolasterone</b> (which is its 7α-isomer).|$|E
50|$|Nandrolone (1) {{appears to}} be used to make mibolerone. For comparison, also see <b>bolasterone</b> and calusterone. The first step {{involves}} extending the conjugation of the enone function by an additional double bond. Chloranil (tetrachloroquinone) is the forerunner of dichlorodicyanoquinone (DDQ), a reagent used extensively for introducing additional unsaturation in the progestin and corticoid series.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bolasterone</b> (INN, USAN) (brand names Myagen, Methosarb; former {{developmental}} code names NSC-66233; U-19763), {{also known}} as 7α,17α-dimethyltestosterone, is a 17α-alkylated anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) that is used in veterinary medicine. It has close structural similarity to testosterone, and like methyltestosterone has a methyl group at C17α {{in order to increase}} oral bioavailability. In addition, it is also 7α-methylated, similar to its 7β-methylated isomer calusterone.|$|E

The separation was achieved by using a reversed-phase Chromolith RP- 18 e column at controlled temperature, UV-detection at 245 nm and epitestosterone as internal standard. The method development involved optimization of different aqueous-organic mobile phases using methanol or acetonitrile as organic modifiers, flow-rate and temperature. The optimum separation for these compounds was achieved at 40 degrees C using ultrapure water:acetonitrile (71 : 29, v/v) as mobile phase and 3 mLmin(- 1) flow-rate, allowing the separation of AASs with baseline resolution in about 15 min. The optimized method {{was applied to the}} analysis of AASs in finishing pig feed samples. Prior to HPLC, sample preparation procedure was used by leaching using acetonitrile, saponification in a basic medium and solid-phase extraction using polymeric Abselut Nexus cartridges. Method validation has been carried out according to the European Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC. The extraction efficiencies, decision limits (CCalpha) and detection capabilities (CCbeta) for these compounds were in the range 83 - 96 %, 27 - 37 and 32 - 47 microgkg(- 1) range, respectively. The within-laboratory reproducibility at 1, 1. 5 and 2 CCbeta concentration levels were smaller than 13, 10 and 8 %, respectively. Finally, the proposed method was successfully applied to nine different kinds of animal feed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{described}} in this report is to develop and characterize a cell-based androgen reporter assay. For this purpose, the androgen receptor (AR) expressing human breast cancer cell line T 47 D was stably transfected with a luciferase gene under transcriptional control of the PB-ARE- 2 androgen response element. The application of this cell line in an endogenous Androgen Receptor-mediated LUciferase eXpression assay (AR-LUX) was validated. An EC 50 value of 86 pM was determined for the standard androgen R 1881 with a detection limit of 46 pM. Other androgens like dihydrotestosterone, 17 β-trenbolone, and <b>bolasterone</b> also induced luciferase expression, while anti-androgens suppressed these responses. As expected, AR-mediated responses were also elicited by high concentrations of the steroids progesterone, 17 β-estradiol, d-aldosterone, and dexamethasone, with observed EC 50 values 10 to 350, 000 times higher than that for R 1881. A unique feature of the AR-LUX assay is that effects on modulation of active endogenous AR-levels are reliably reflected in the luciferase induction response, as exemplified by vitamin D, all-trans-retinoic acid, epigallocatechin gallate, and forskolin. This feature is especially useful when assessing complex mixtures, e. g., environmental samples or natural compound libraries. From these data it is concluded that the AR-LUX assay is a reliable in vitro test system for the detection and quantification of AR-mediated biological effects. The 96 -well plate format makes the assay particularly suitable for high-throughput screening.
