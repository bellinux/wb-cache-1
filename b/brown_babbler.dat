50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>babbler</b> (Turdoides plebejus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Leiothrichidae. It is {{predominantly}} found in West Africa, but ranging from the Gambia to Kenya. The species is common across its range. The species {{is also known as}} the Sudan babbler.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>babbler</b> consumes {{a variety}} of insects {{including}} ants, beetles, termites, and praying mantises, {{as well as other}} invertebrates, berries, and fruit. It will also opportunistically take carrion. They generally forage on the ground and in family paries of up to 14 individuals.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>babbler</b> inhabits {{the broad}} {{band of the}} Sahel between the Sahara Desert and the {{tropical}} forests of Western Africa, from southern Mauritania, Senegal and the Gambia to southern Sudan, Uganda and western Kenya. The species lives in open savanna, wooded grasslands, riparian habitat in drier areas, degraded cultivation, farmlands, parks and gardens. The species is common across its range and readily lives in human modified habitat and is not considered threatened with extinction.|$|E
25|$|The park {{is home to}} over 200 bird species, {{including}} such rare birds as the chestnut-necklaced partridge, red-collared woodpecker, <b>brown</b> hornbill, sooty <b>babbler</b> and the short-tailed scimitar babbler. An initiative survey conducted by Russian and Vietnamese scientists from Vietnam-Russia Tropical Centre (funded by WWF) recorded 259 butterfly species of 11 families. Almost all major butterfly taxa in Vietnam {{can be found in}} Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is Demi's and {{my private}} place; we made it, {{and nobody can}} come up unless we let 'em, except Daisy, we don't mind her," [...] said Tommy, as Nat looked with delight from the <b>babbling</b> <b>brown</b> water below to the green arch above, where bees were making a musical murmur as they feasted on the long yellow {{blossoms}} that filled the air with sweetness.|$|R
50|$|The adult Abbott's babbler is {{a nondescript}} <b>brown,</b> short-tailed <b>babbler</b> that moves {{about in the}} low {{vegetation}} often near streams and {{in the vicinity of}} tree ferns and tangled vegetation. The throat is greyish white while the center of the belly is white and the flanks are olive. The undertail coverts are rusty. The sexes are alike. It has a short tail and heavy bill; it is drab olive-brown with bright rusty lower flanks and vent, a greyish-white throat and breast and variable pale grey supercilium and lores. Juvenile birds have dark rufescent-brown crowns and upperparts. The subspecies M. a. krishnarajui of the Eastern Ghats has a darker russet tail and rump than the Himalayan nominate subspecies. Specimens measure 12 - 13 cm in length, with a head of 39 - 44 mm and tail of 55 - 61 mm. The calls are distinctive.|$|R
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>babbler</b> is a {{medium-sized}} Turdoides babbler, measuring 22 - 25 cm {{in length and}} weighs around 52 - 80 g. The plumage is grey-brown with a white-streaked throat and breast and a scaled head. The wings are bronze-brown, the bill black and the legs dusky or slaty black. The iris of the eyes are yellow. The sexes are alike, and juvenile birds are like the adults but with plainer and browner plumage and brown irises.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>babbler</b> was {{described}} in 1828 by Philipp Jakob Cretzschmar from a specimen collected in the Kordofan Province of Sudan. He originally placed it in the bulbul genus Ixos. The species {{is closely related to}} and forms a superspecies with the white-headed babbler of eastern Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea, and the arrow-marked babbler of central and southern Africa. The Old World babbler family Timaliidae {{has been the subject of}} much research and has been split by some taxonomic authorities. This move that would place this species with the laughingthrushes in the family Leiothrichidae.|$|E
6000|$|Nat's {{favorite}} amusements {{were working}} in his garden, and sitting in the willow-tree with his violin, for that green nest was a fairy world to him, and there he loved to perch, making music like a happy bird. The lads called him [...] "Old Chirper," [...] because he was always humming, whistling, or fiddling, and they often stopped a minute in their work or play {{to listen to the}} soft tones of the violin, which seemed to lead a little orchestra of summer sounds. The birds appeared to regard him as one of themselves, and fearlessly sat on the fence or lit among the boughs to watch him with their quick bright eyes. The robins in the apple-tree near by evidently considered him a friend, for the father bird hunted insects close beside him, and the little mother brooded as confidingly over her blue eggs as if the boy was only a new sort of blackbird who cheered her patient watch with his song. The <b>brown</b> brook <b>babbled</b> and sparkled below him, the bees haunted the clover fields on either side, friendly faces peeped at him as they passed, the old house stretched its wide wings hospitably toward him, and with a blessed sense of rest and love and happiness, Nat dreamed for hours in this nook, unconscious what healthful miracles were being wrought upon him.|$|R
25|$|Of the 59 {{recorded}} reptile and amphibian species, 18 {{are listed}} in Vietnam's Red Data Book and 6 {{are listed in}} the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals. Further research has increased the species numbers markedly, and the number of recorded amphibian species is now 50 and that of reptile species 101. The 72 fish species include 4 species endemic to the area, including Danio quangbinhensis. The park is home to over 200 bird species, inclusive of several rare birds such as: chestnut-necklaced partridge, red-collared woodpecker, <b>brown</b> hornbill, sooty <b>babbler</b> and short-tailed scimitar babbler. There is good evidence for the Vietnamese pheasant (Lophura hatinhensis) and imperial pheasant (Lophura imperialis) species at Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng area. An initiative survey conducted by Russian and Vietnamese scientists from Vietnam-Russia Tropical Centre (funded by WWF) recorded 259 butterfly species of 11 families. Almost all major butterfly taxa in Vietnam can be found in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng park.|$|R
40|$|In present conference environments where video {{recording}} is required, {{a set of}} cameras operated by a human being is needed to track the active speaker as he discusses in the conference. In order to automate this procedure, different methods have been developed in acoustic and visual tracking. In this thesis work, a robust speaker tracking system is developed namely, Steered Response Power PHase Alignment Transform (SRP-PHAT) and Steered Response Kurtosis PHase Alignment Transform (SRK-PHAT) which compute the likelihood of each source position using the generalized cross correlation estimations between each pair of microphones. While developing the hands-free speech applications in a smart room environment, speech source will be located {{at a distance from}} the microphones and the effect of presence of noise and reverberation is high in estimating the location of the speech source. The accuracy of the SRP-Phat and SRK-Phat methods in estimating the source location is limited by the time resolution of weighted PHAT function. In this thesis work, SRP-Phat and SRK-Phat has been implemented using 2 element microphone array and 4 element microphone array and to compare the above methods in detail, the performance of the methods has been analyzed for 64, 128 and 256 subbands in a WOLA filter bank. The estimated Time difference of arrival (TDOA’s) and Direction of Arrival (DOA’s) of SRPPhat and SRK-Phat are compared along with Original values to determine the best method for estimating the speech source location. Mean estimation error and Standard deviation are calculated to determine the accuracy of the TDOA’s estimated. In this thesis work, Wiener Beamforming is implemented for removing noise and reverberation in a room environment using a 2 element microphone array. The performance of the method is analyzed using Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ). In order to improve the results obtained, a De-reverberation procedure is also included in the Wiener Beamforming method and the improvement in PESQ values is discussed in chapter 4. The performance of the wiener beamforming method is tested for <b>brown</b> noise, <b>babble</b> noise, fan noise and white noise...|$|R
