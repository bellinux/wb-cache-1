50|$|Buoyancy aids {{come with}} a set of {{specifications}} detailing their sizing, weight range, and the standards they adhere to.

50|$|<b>Buoyancy</b> <b>aids</b> for sea {{and long}} {{distance}} touring often feature several large pockets for storing essential equipment, and many also accommodate hydration packs.

50|$|All {{buoyancy}} aids {{include some}} form of strap for tightening the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>aid,</b> preventing it from coming off in the water.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the performance of quick-release harness <b>buoyancy</b> <b>aids</b> in water rescue. Design/methodology/approach – The assumption is questioned that the performance of water rescue harnesses, in what is perceived as benign, low-flow conditions (< 1. 85 [*]km/s) is acceptable. Increasingly, rescue personnel are deployed to flooding events during which low-flow, but high-hazard conditions may prevail. A range of commercially available <b>buoyancy</b> <b>aids</b> manufactured in the UK were tested under “real world conditions” and the nature of the release rated. Findings – The primary data illustrate that 25 per cent of releases where incomplete in low-flow conditions. By analogy a karabiner in a rope rescue system with a 1 : 4 chance of failure would be unacceptable. Consequently, harness testing, design, manufacture, use and deployment may all be in need of reconsideration if the harness is to remain suitable for its current deployment. Originality/value – A group of international experts from the USA, Europe and the UK have reviewed the findings and highlight possible reasons for these failures. These comments form the basis for research in future papers...|$|R
50|$|Improvised {{harnesses}} (ropes {{around the}} waist, belts, or attaching ropes {{directly onto the}} <b>buoyancy</b> <b>aid</b> itself) can present a serious danger to the wearer, as {{they can not be}} released or may not be strong enough to withstand the load required.|$|E
5000|$|In the USA, a <b>buoyancy</b> <b>aid</b> may be {{approved}} by the United States Coast Guard (although this is not a requirement). Most canoeing and kayaking buoyancy aids class as [...] "Type III Flotation Aids", which means they provide a minimum of 15.5 lbf (pounds-force) (69 N) of buoyancy.|$|E
50|$|Many {{white water}} {{buoyancy}} aids, {{as well as}} some sea kayak ones, feature a safety harness. These fit around the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>aid</b> below the arms and can be used for Live Bait Rescues (where a rescuer swims out into the river on a line to rescue a swimmer) or for anchoring a belayer onto the bank. They feature quick-release buckles to quickly remove the harness, and these are often (but not always) designed to release automatically past a certain load/pressure. Often harnesses have a metal ring at the back for attaching a rope with a screwgate carabiner. Use of a non-locking carabiner can allow the carabiner to accidentally clip onto other straps on the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>aid</b> during use, thus preventing the harness from being released, and as such they should not be used for attaching to a harness.|$|E
2500|$|Some <b>buoyancy</b> <b>aids</b> {{also come}} {{designed}} especially {{for children and}} youth. These vests may include one or two understraps to be worn between {{the legs of the}} wearer and also a headrest flap. The understraps are designed to keep the vest from riding up when worn in the water and restrict the wearer from slipping out of the life vest. These straps are adjustable and are included on many different life vests designed to be worn by everyone from infants to adults.|$|R
