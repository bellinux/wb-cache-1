5|$|The NAACP {{then brought}} suit {{challenging}} all five laws in state court. A state circuit court held {{three of the}} laws unconstitutional, but upheld the <b>barratry</b> law and the law prohibiting advocacy of lawsuits against the state. On appeal, the Virginia Supreme Court struck down the anti-advocacy law as well, but upheld the <b>barratry</b> law. In a 6-to-3 ruling in 1963 that gave broad protection to public interest legal organizations, the U.S. Supreme Court in NAACP v. Button, held that all five of the <b>barratry,</b> champerty, and maintenance laws violated the 1st and 14th Amendments to the constitution.|$|E
5|$|On September 10, Delegate C. Harrison Mann {{introduced}} 16 bills {{aimed at}} curbing the NAACP in Virginia. Five {{of the bills}} expanded the state's definitions of <b>barratry,</b> champerty, and maintenance. The eleven other bills collectively required the following groups to file a financial report and membership list annually with state: any group which promotes or opposes state legislation aimed at any race; any organization attempting to influence public opinion on behalf of any race; or any group raising funds to employ legal counsel in connection with racial litigation.|$|E
5|$|Following Jefferson's {{return to}} Grimsby, Marstrand's were puzzled by Orsborne's actions, but {{initially}} {{thought that he}} had taken on another engineer in Dover and had gone fishing, perhaps in new grounds. There were unconfirmed sightings of Girl Pat in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere. As weeks passed with no definite news, the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost, either through foundering or <b>barratry,</b> and claimed insurance. They had already received sums totalling £2,400 from the underwriters, when they were surprised by the arrival of bills from Corcubión, together with the news that Girl Pat had sailed from the port on 24 April, her destination unknown.|$|E
60|$|I ask pardon of {{the learned}} {{gentlemen of the}} long robe if I do them any wrong in this chapter, having no design to affront them when I say that in matters of debate among {{merchant}}s, {{when they come to}} be argued by lawyers at the bar, they are strangely handled. I myself have heard very famous lawyers make sorry work of a cause between the merchant and his factor; and when they come to argue about exchanges, discounts, protests, demurrages, charter-parties, freights, port-charges, assurances, <b>barratries,</b> bottomries, accounts current, accounts in commission, and accounts in company, and the like, the solicitor {{has not been able to}} draw a brief, nor the counsel to understand it. Never was young parson more put to it to make out his text when he is got into the pulpit without his notes than I have seen a counsel at the bar when he would make out a cause between two merchants. And I remember a pretty history of a particular case, by way of instance, when two merchants, contending about a long factorage account, that had all the niceties of merchandising in it, and labouring on both sides to instruct their counsel, and to put them in when they were out, at last they found them make such ridiculous stuff of it that they both threw up the cause and agreed to a reference, which reference in one week, without any charge, ended all the dispute, which they had spent a great deal of money in before to no purpose.|$|R
5|$|The Virginia NAACP {{filed suit}} {{in federal court in}} 1956 to have the five <b>barratry,</b> champerty, and {{maintenance}} laws thrown out as an unconstitutional infringement of the 1st Amendment rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. A three-judge panel of a U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia agreed that three of the laws were unconstitutional, but reserved judgment on the other two laws pending interpretation by state courts (which had not yet ruled on the laws' legality). Both the state and the NAACP appealed. In Harrison v. NAACP, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-to-3 that the district court should have withheld judgment until state courts had considered the issue first.|$|E
5|$|Villani and the Buonaccorsi {{had gained}} an unsavory {{reputation}} {{as early as}} 1331, when Villani was tried (and cleared) for <b>barratry</b> {{for his part in}} building the new third circuit of walls around Florence. Charles, Duke of Calabria had granted the Buonaccorsi the right to tax three of the six districts of Florence, which did not help Villani's reputation amongst his fellow citizens. In early June 1342, partners and agents of the Buonaccorsi suddenly fled Florence, Avignon, and Naples, following bankruptcy proceedings by creditors, nearly all of whom had deposits in the Buonaccorsi bank. Like other Florentine bankers and companies having difficulty with bankruptcy at the time, in September 1342 they supported the move to invite WalterVI of Brienne to become the next signor of Florence. Walter later suspended all legal actions taken against the Buonaccorsi and other company partners for nearly a year.|$|E
25|$|Strictly speaking, {{the crime}} of the mutineers (apart from the {{disciplinary}} crime of mutiny) was not piracy but <b>barratry,</b> the misappropriation, by those entrusted with its care, of a ship and/or its contents {{to the detriment of}} the owner (in this case the British Crown).|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{disputes}} concerning the Church of Scientology's attempts to suppress material critical of Scientology on the Internet, utilizing lawsuits and legal threats. In late 1994, the Church of Scientology began using various legal tactics to stop distribution of unpublished documents written by L. Ron Hubbard. The Church of Scientology is often accused of <b>barratry</b> through the filing of SLAPP suits. The official church response is that its litigious nature is solely to protect its copyrighted works and the unpublished status of certain documents.|$|E
500|$|When the consul {{reported}} {{that what he}} had bought was almost worthless, the ship's insurers began a thorough investigation, which soon revealed {{the truth of the}} over-insured cargo. In July 1885, Parker and the shippers were tried in Boston for conspiracy to commit insurance fraud. Parker was additionally charged with [...] "wilfully cast away the ship," [...] a crime known as <b>barratry</b> and at the time carrying the death penalty. The conspiracy case was heard first, but on August 15, the jury announced that they could not agree on a verdict. Some jurors were unwilling to risk prejudicing Parker's forthcoming capital trial by finding him guilty on the conspiracy charge. Rather than ordering an expensive retrial, the judge negotiated an arrangement whereby the defendants withdrew their insurance claims and repaid all they had received. The <b>barratry</b> charge against Parker was deferred, and he was allowed to go free. Nevertheless, his professional reputation was ruined, and he died in poverty three months later. One of his co-defendants went mad, and another committed suicide. Begg observes that [...] "if the court of man could not punish these men... the curse that had devilled the ship since her first skipper Robert McLellan had died on her maiden voyage could reach beyond the vessel's watery grave and exact its own terrible retribution." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the Civil Rights Movement {{developed}} during the postwar era, Tucker came to have {{a central role in}} its legal battles in Virginia. He ultimately filed suits in nearly 50 counties, including Alexandria and neighboring Arlington and Fairfax. By the time Brown v. Board of Education was decided in 1954 and 1955, the NAACP state legal staff had grown to a dozen cooperating attorneys (including Tucker), and had filed fifteen petitions requesting desegregation with local school boards by the spring of 1956. However, U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd had vowed Massive Resistance to school desegregation, and that fall a special session of the Virginia General Assembly adopted (and Governor Thomas B. Stanley signed) a package of new laws to maintain segregation and close desegregating schools, which {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Stanley plan." [...] That collection of bills also contained seven relating to NAACP activities, and expanded the definitions of the common law legal ethics offenses of <b>barratry,</b> champerty and maintenance.|$|E

60|$|In {{this part}} of the Triana lived the colony of English merchants, once so {{numerous}} that they had their own club and gymnasium. All had taken the local colouring, and were more Spanish than the Spaniards. A celebrated case of <b>barratry</b> was going on in 1863, the date of my first visit, when Lloyds sent out a detective and my friend Capt. Heathcote, I.N., to conduct the legal proceedings. I innocently asked why the British vice-consul was not sufficient, and was assured that no resident could interfere, alias dared do his duty, under pain of social ostracism and a host of enmities. In those days a man who gained his lawsuit went about weaponed and escorted, as in modern Ireland, by a troop of armed servants. Landlord-potting also was by no means unknown; and the murder of the Marquess de las Palmas caused memorable sensation.|$|E

To a stranger, this conversation will at first seem scarcely brilliant but he will soon catch the tone; {{and by the time}} he shall have moved a year or so in the island world, and come across a good number of the schooners, so that every captain's name calls up a figure in pyjamas or white duck, and becomes used to a certain laxity of moral tone which prevails (as in memory of Mr. Hayes) on smuggling, ship-scuttling, <b>barratry,</b> piracy, the labour trade, and other kindred fields of human activity, he will find Polynesia no less amusing and no less instructive than Pall Mall or Paris.|$|E

50|$|Several jurisdictions in the United States have {{declared}} <b>barratry</b> (in {{the sense of}} a frivolous or harassing litigant) to be a crime as part of their tort reform efforts. For example, in the U.S. states of California, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington, <b>barratry</b> is a misdemeanor. In Texas, <b>barratry</b> is a misdemeanor on the first conviction, but a felony on subsequent convictions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Barratry</b> {{is usually}} {{considered}} {{a crime against}} the ship's owner. Therefore, if the owner himself chooses to wreck the ship, no crime is committed, as the owner simply destroyed his own property - however, this {{can be considered a}} crime against any other owners. Also, harm to the crew can qualify as <b>barratry</b> regardless of who damaged the vessel. Throughout the 19th century, courts in the United States struggled with defining and understanding the law. Courts have concluded that negligence is not enough to qualify as <b>barratry,</b> but that it instead requires an intentional act and an intent to defraud. Similarly, deviating from the assigned course is also not by itself <b>barratry.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Barratry</b> ( [...] ) is a {{legal term}} with several meanings. In common law, <b>barratry</b> is the offense {{committed}} {{by people who are}} [...] "overly officious in instigating or encouraging prosecution of groundless litigation" [...] or who bring [...] "repeated or persistent acts of litigation" [...] for the purposes of profit or harassment. It is a crime in some jurisdictions. If litigation is for the purpose of silencing critics, it is known as a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP). Jurisdictions that otherwise have no <b>barratry</b> laws may have SLAPP laws.|$|E

In the case, a ship was planned to sail to Gibraltar to sell flour, and then use the profits to purchase goods in Marseille. However, at Gibraltar, a fire started aboard ship, destroying the ship and the cargo inside. The plaintiffs argued that the crew could have saved the ship but failed. The courts ruled, however, that failure to stop a fire, even if negligent, does not constitute <b>barratry.</b> Fire was ruled {{the cause of the}} cargo's destruction, not <b>barratry</b> and the insurance company was required to pay.|$|E

50|$|Cante Gabrielli was Commander in Chief of the Guelph League in Central Italy and Podestà (Lord-Mayor) of Florence.

50|$|Until 1885, <b>barratry</b> was {{a capital}} {{offense in the}} United States. Juries {{routinely}} refused to convict people of the crime, even if their guilt was obvious, as they did not consent {{to the death penalty}} for <b>barratry.</b> This came to a head in the destruction of the Mary Celeste in 1885. The Mary Celeste was already infamous since 1872 after being discovered adrift but in good condition with no one on board. This became a high-profile case. In 1885 her last owner, Captain G.C. Parker, was accused of <b>barratry,</b> in that he deliberately ran her aground and burned her, then made an exorbitant insurance claim for a non-existent cargo. Despite this obvious attempt at insurance fraud, and clear evidence of his guilt, five of the twelve jurors refused to convict Parker, to avoid condemning him to death. This led to the death penalty being abolished for this crime three years after the trial.|$|E
