On the day of free agency, newly appointed Vancouver Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis offered Sundin a lucrative two-year, $20 million contract which, if signed, would have made him the highest paid player in the NHL. Attempting to entice him to sign with the Canucks, numerous Vancouver <b>businesses</b> <b>extended</b> Swedish-centred special offers, such as a Volvo and IKEA products. The New York Rangers, Canadiens and Leafs also made contract offers; however, Sundin chose to hold out {{for the beginning of}} the season, contemplating retirement. After announcing that he would, in fact, return to the NHL and sign with a team, he narrowed his prospects down to the Rangers and Canucks. [...] On 18 December 2008, the Canucks announced that Sundin had signed with the club to a one-year, $8.6 million contract.
