5|$|Life on {{the island}} was very {{isolated}} due to its inaccessibility. Until as late as 1894 it had no landing place, which meant that boats had to be landed directly {{on the beach and}} pulled up above the waterline. Particularly in winter, when storms raged through the Pentland Firth, Stroma could be cut off for weeks at a time. Such episodes posed serious risks to the islanders, as they had no doctor. The winter of 1937 illustrated the problems that the weather could pose; during January and February that year, the island was cut off for three weeks by violent gales which demolished houses along the seafront and washed boats 100 yards (90m) inland. Stroma's isolation came at an especially <b>bad</b> <b>time,</b> as most of the population had caught influenza and supplies of food dwindled to the point that some items had to be rationed. Eventually two boats were able to reach the island, carrying supplies and a doctor from Caithness, along with three weeks' worth of mail.|$|E

With estimated emissions levels of 2.25 Mt of carbon dioxide per year, the Suroît plant would have increased the provincial CO2 emissions by nearly 3%. Faced with a public uproar — a poll conducted in January 2004 found that two of every three Quebecers were opposed to it—the Jean Charest government abandoned the project in November 2004.|$|E

40|$|Because {{uncertainty}} {{is high in}} <b>bad</b> <b>times,</b> investors find it harder to assess firm prospects and, hence, should value analyst output more. However, higher uncertainty makes analysts’ tasks harder so it is unclear if analyst output is more valuable in <b>bad</b> <b>times.</b> We find that, in <b>bad</b> <b>times,</b> analyst revisions have a larger stock-price impact, earnings forecast errors per unit of uncertainty fall, reports are more frequent and longer, {{and the impact of}} analyst output increases more for harder-to-value firms. These results are consistent with analysts working harder and investors relying more on analysts in <b>bad</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R

25|$|Domingo Ortega {{suffered}} an automobile accident, and his proxy, Dominguín, asked Sánchez {{to substitute for}} him in Manzanares, on 11 August 1934. This came at a <b>bad</b> <b>time</b> for Sánchez, but because the bulls were great {{he did not want}} to seem like he was avoiding them. He had no car, no hotel, not even a cuadrilla (bullfighting team). For the first time in his life, he turned to the lottery and drew two tickets with the numbers of the bulls of Ayala that he was scheduled to fight. The first, number 16, Granadino, docile, thin-horned and coarse-skinned, nevertheless gored him.|$|E
25|$|Hunter's returns diminished {{further in}} the 200708 WNCL. In the second match of the season, she took 2/30 from ten overs in a 42-run win over Western Australia, and then took 4/35 form ten overs against New South Wales, who made 8/228 {{and went on to}} win 25 runs. However, she failed to take another wicket in the {{remaining}} four matches at an economy rate over five. Victoria won only three of eight matches and did not make the final. Hunter ended with six wickets at 35.16 at a relatively high economy rate of 4.12 and made 8 runs at 4.00. She also had a <b>bad</b> <b>time</b> in her only T20 match, conceding 44 runs without taking a wicket in four overs as South Australia scored 1/59 to win by nine wickets.|$|E
25|$|Preparations {{are being}} made for the three guests to eat at the nearby golf club {{as it is the}} night off for the Elgins, Clarissa's married butler and cook. Sir Rowland congratulates Clarissa on her {{relationship}} with and handling of Pippa who had a <b>bad</b> <b>time</b> with her real mother, Miranda and her drug-supplying lover, Oliver Costello. A phone call to the house is strangely cut off when Clarissa tells the caller that she is not Mrs. Brown but Mrs. Hailsham-Brown. Clarissa tells Sir Rowland that the house used to belong to a Mr. Sellon, a now-deceased antique dealer in Maidstone and the furnishings are his. His former trade means that enquiries are received about some of his furniture, including one for the desk that, unbeknown to her, Jeremy had been searching through earlier. Walking in on the conversation, Pippa tells the two that she has found out that the desk has a secret drawer and she shows it to them together with its contents: an envelope with three autographed papers inside with the signatures of Queen Victoria, John Ruskin and Robert Browning on them.|$|E

500|$|According to Fleming's biographer, Andrew Lycett, {{after the}} novel was completed, Fleming added four extra {{chapters}} [...] "almost as an afterthought", detailing the {{events on the}} Queen Elizabeth. This introduced the question of marriage, and allowed Fleming to discuss matrimony through his characters, with Bond telling Case [...] "Most marriages don't add two people together. They subtract one from the other." [...] Lycett opines that the addition {{was because of the}} state of Fleming's own marriage which was going through a <b>bad</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
500|$|In August 1984 the orchestra's {{managing}} director, Peter Hemmings, resigned. For {{the first}} time since 1949, the orchestra appointed one of its players to the position. Clive Gillinson, a cellist, took over at a <b>bad</b> <b>time</b> in the LSO's fortunes, and {{played a central role in}} turning them round. He negotiated what Morrison calls [...] "a dazzling series of mega-projects, each built around the personal enthusiasm of a 'star' conductor or soloist", producing sell-out houses.

500|$|Invincible was {{released}} on October 30, 2001 to much anticipation. It was Jackson's first full-length album in six years, and the last album of original material he released in his lifetime. It debuted at number one in 13 countries {{and went on to}} sell approximately 13 million copies worldwide. It received double-platinum certification in the U.S. However, sales for Invincible were lower than Jackson's previous releases, {{due in part to the}} record label dispute and the lack of promotion or tour, and its release at a <b>bad</b> <b>time</b> for the music industry in general. Invincible spawned three singles, [...] "You Rock My World", [...] "Cry", and [...] "Butterflies", the latter without a music video.|$|E

Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs.

500|$|Although forty-eight {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier; {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Reutimann clinched his second pole position in the Sprint Cup Series, {{with a time of}} 28.344. He was joined on the grid's front row by Jeff Gordon. Matt Kenseth qualified third, Ragan took fourth, and Paul Menard started fifth. Kahne, Tony Stewart, Kyle Busch, Johnson and Joey Logano rounded out the top ten qualifiers. The five drivers who failed to qualify were Joe Nemechek, Scott Speed, Jeremy Mayfield, Todd Bodine and Scott Riggs. After the qualifier Reutimann said, [...] "We had a great car all day, right off the truck. This pole reminds me of how much things have changed for me in the past few years.

500|$|Morrison's {{also contributed}} [...] "Been Down So Long", a song {{inspired}} by folk singer Richard Fariña's book Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me and Furry Lewis's tune, [...] "I Will Turn Your Money Green". A conventional blues song reminiscent of earlier Doors performances, the lyrics showed depression, liberation, and sexuality owing to Morrison's potential imprisonment. He also contributed the blues number [...] "Cars Hiss By My Window". Unlike {{most of the}} other tracks, it was composed in the studio. Manzarek recalled that [...] "Jim said it was about living in Venice , in a hot room, with a hot girlfriend, and an open window, and a <b>bad</b> <b>time.</b> It could have been about Pamela Courson". L.A. Woman closes its first side with the title track, the lengthiest song on the album. Thought of as Morrison's final goodbye to Los Angeles, it communicated his mixed feelings of passion and disdain for [...] "the city of night". The lyrics feature an anagram for Morrison: [...] "Mr. Mojo Risin'".|$|E
500|$|Singer Gruff Rhys has {{described}} [...] "Ysbeidiau Heulog" [...] as [...] "throwaway pop ... old time pop music", likening the song {{to the work}} of ELO and going on to claim that it is a tribute to late 1960s pop bands such as The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band and Os Mutantes. Rhys has stated that his lyrics are about [...] "looking back at a <b>bad</b> <b>time</b> which had the odd good moment" [...] and that [...] "If there's any song that doesn't sum up [...] it's !" [...] The track was recorded in 1999 at Famous Studios, Cardiff and was engineered by Greg Haver. Overdubs were added at Ofn studios, Llanfaelog, Wales with the help of Gorwel Owen who also mixed the song at the studio along with the Super Furry Animals. B-side [...] "Charge" [...] was recorded for an episode of BBC Radio 1's The John Peel Show, which aired on 1 March 2000.

500|$|Most of Martha's storylines were {{central to}} her on-off {{relationship}} with Jack Holden (Paul O'Brien). Viewers saw the couple go through marriage, divorce, a second marriage and Martha being widowed. Holy Soap said that Martha and Jack {{proved to be}} one of the [...] "best loved couples", before they married for the first time. However, their marriage does not last long and they split. Martha and Jack start to lead separate lives, but Jack is there for Martha after she has an abortion. Martha is feeling low at this point and kisses him; Jack's girlfriend Sam Tolhurst (Jessica Chapnik) sees this. O'Brien stated: [...] "I think Jack felt like 'Oh this is nice, but I've moved on, I've finally moved on and found someone', but deep down he still wants Martha." [...] Martha is left [...] "shattered" [...] after Jack plans to marry Sam. Martha was caught trying on Sam's wedding dress as she tried to figure out if she still had feelings for Jack. Gordon said that from day one, Jack and Martha have wanted to be together, but [...] "they're never in the same headspace". O'Brien added that he believes Jack was always in love with Martha, even whilst he was in a relationship with Sam. Both O'Brien and Gordon agreed that when Jack and Martha first broke up it was a <b>bad</b> <b>time</b> for Jack, as his life was spiraling out of control, he needed her, but she left him when he needed her the most. They later become friends; O'Brien believed it was hard to understand how Jack could be so forgiving toward her.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on Mwng feature quite solemn, {{personal}} lyrics, which reflect on a difficult few years for Rhys. The single, [...] "Ysbeidiau Heulog", is about [...] "looking back at a <b>bad</b> <b>time</b> which had the odd good moment", while [...] "Pan Ddaw'r Wawr" [...] deals {{with the death of}} rural communities. The singer claims to have wept—rather than sung—the album's last track, [...] "Gwreiddiau Dwfn" [...] / [...] "Mawrth Oer Ar y Blaned Neifion", which features lyrics [...] "so bleak it's almost comic" [...] about [...] "being rooted to a sad piece of land [...] being doomed to live somewhere and that's all you have and that's what you're stuck with". Rhys has described Datblygu's [...] "Y Teimlad" [...] as being about [...] "not knowing what love is or what love means." [...] "Drygioni" [...] is a song about [...] "sleaze [...] about good versus evil, and a person's need for both", and [...] "Y Gwyneb Iau" [...] is a [...] "moody song about war" [...] whose title is a Welsh insult that translates into English as [...] "Liverface". In contrast, [...] "Nythod Cacwn" [...] is a comedic song, based on an incident involving drummer Dafydd Ieuan being chased by bees after he disturbed a beehive while attempting to build a bonfire on a beach. It features lyrics that were [...] "made up on the spot" [...] by Rhys. [...] "Dacw Hi" [...] is inspired by one of Rhys's former teachers who claimed she had eyes {{in the back of her}} head. [...] "Sarn Helen" [...] is about the decline of the Roman road of the same name that was built between North and South Wales. [...] "Ymaelodi Â'r Ymylon" [...] is partly inspired by the ostracisation the band felt from some areas of the Welsh musical community due to their decision to sing in English on earlier albums. The track's lyrics feature the old Welsh idiom [...] "y cythraul canu", which means [...] "the demon in music" [...] and refers to the friction this can create between people.|$|E
