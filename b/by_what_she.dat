5|$|In Los Angeles, Travers is irritated <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{perceives}} as the city's unreality and the inhabitants' intrusive friendliness, personified by her limousine driver, Ralph. At the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Travers {{meets the}} creative team that are developing Mary Poppins for the screen: screenwriter Don DaGradi, and music composers Richard and Robert Sherman. She finds their presumptions and casual manners highly improper, a view she also holds of the jocular Disney.|$|E

In 2002, the script earned her a fellowship to the Los Angeles Film School's Feature Development Programme, where she developed the project, and it was later picked up by Tama Films. Randall returned to Australia for casting, and Catanzariti was eventually chosen in the lead role after she attended an audition for minor roles and extras. Production spanned from October to December 2006, with filming taking place in Adelaide, South Australia and Sydney, New South Wales.|$|E

Conceived and targeted for an American readership, Stein's translations were ultimately never published in the United States.

She and several friends, including Ellen Gates Starr, traveled in Europe from December 1887 through {{the summer of}} 1888. After watching a bullfight in Madrid, fascinated <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> saw as an exotic tradition, Addams condemned this fascination and her inability to feel outraged at {{the suffering of the}} horses and bulls. At first, Addams told no one about her dream to start a settlement house; but, she felt increasingly guilty for not acting on her dream. Believing that sharing her dream might help her to act on it, she told Ellen Gates Starr. Starr loved the idea and agreed to join Addams in starting a settlement house.|$|E

Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami.

500|$|In late 1810, King George III {{began his}} final descent into madness. [...] Charlotte and the King were {{very fond of}} each other, and the young Princess was greatly saddened by his illness. [...] On 6 February 1811, Charlotte's father {{was sworn in as}} Prince Regent before the Privy Council, as Charlotte rode {{back and forth in the}} gardens outside Carlton House, trying to catch glimpses of the {{ceremony}} through the ground-floor windows. [...] Charlotte was an enthusiastic Whig, as her father had been. [...] However, now that he was exercising the powers of the monarchy, he did not recall the Whigs to office as many had expected him to do. Charlotte was outraged <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> saw as her father's treason, and, at the opera, demonstrated her support by blowing kisses in the direction of the Whig leader, Earl Grey.|$|E
500|$|After this failure, Gasper {{returned}} to her blog to argue there were [...] "far too many homosexual comedians on TV", focusing her criticism on Graham Norton, [...] "the horrid little Alan Carr", and [...] "the unctuous Stephen Fry [...] portly, preening and self-satisfied." [...] She also posted that homosexuals were not persecuted {{anywhere in the world}} and that claims to the contrary, such as those regarding the murders of Matthew Shepard and David Kato, were [...] "fraudulent". Pink News, she said, operated as a [...] "mafia" [...] and had placed the actor Rupert Everett on its [...] "hit list", forcing him to obtain police protection. In October 2014, Pink News founder Benjamin Cohen claimed this constituted libel and threatened legal action against her.

500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school in 1965, Bundy spent a year at the University of Puget Sound (UPS) before {{transferring}} to the University of Washington (UW) in 1966 to study Chinese. In 1967 he became romantically involved with a UW classmate who is identified in Bundy biographies by several pseudonyms, most commonly Stephanie Brooks. In early 1968 he dropped out of college and worked at a series of minimum-wage jobs. He also volunteered at the Seattle office of Nelson Rockefeller's presidential campaign and in August attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami as a Rockefeller delegate. Shortly thereafter Brooks ended their relationship and returned to her family home in California, frustrated <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> described as Bundy's immaturity and lack of ambition. Psychiatrist Dorothy Lewis would later pinpoint this crisis as [...] "probably the pivotal time in his development". Devastated by Brooks's rejection, Bundy traveled to Colorado and then farther east, visiting relatives in Arkansas and Philadelphia and enrolling for one semester at Temple University. It was at this time in early 1969, Rule believes, that Bundy visited the office of birth records in Burlington and confirmed his true parentage.|$|E

500|$|Through {{the winter}} of 1937–38 Mitford's main {{literary}} task was editing the [...] letters of her cousins the Stanleys of Alderley, with whom she was connected through her great-grandmother Blanche Airlie. Her preoccupation with this project—nine or ten hours a day, she informed her friend Robert Byron— further damaged her relationship with Rodd, who resented the time thus spent. Nevertheless, {{in the summer of}} 1938 she discovered she was pregnant. She hoped for a girl: [...] "2 Peter Rodds in 1 house is unthinkable", but in September she miscarried. Early in 1939 Rodd left for the South of France, to work with the relief organisations assisting the thousands of Spanish refugees who had fled from General Franco's armies {{in the final stages of}} the civil war. In May Mitford joined him, and spent several weeks there as a relief worker. She was much affected <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> saw: [...] "I have never cried so much in all my life".

500|$|While {{recording}} in New York City, {{the previously}} released [...] "Bow Down" [...] {{was incorporated into}} a track that became [...] "Flawless".

Organic approaches were taken when writing and recording [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] and [...] "Partition". When working with Detail and Timbaland on a beat that became [...] "Drunk in Love", she was inspired <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> described as pure enjoyment, as both she and Jay-Z free-styled their verses for the track in the studio. Similarly, the bassline of [...] "Partition", which Beyoncé found reminiscent of hip hop music during her early romance with Jay-Z, influenced her to accompany the track with sexual lyrics. She took to a microphone without pen and paper and rapped the first verse, finding herself initially embarrassed by the explicitness of the lyrics. When composing [...] "Partition", a rap known as [...] "Yoncé" [...] {{was used as the}} opening of the track, the beat of which was built by Justin Timberlake banging on buckets in the studio.|$|E
500|$|In {{the later}} Tandy period (1946– 1949) and {{continuing}} throughout the 1950s, Nancy is depicted less {{frequently in the}} center of the action. The Ghost of Blackwood Hall shows an assertive Nancy leading more timid friends up the front steps of the haunted house, and marks a transition to later illustrations. From 1949 forward, she is likely to be observing others, often hiding or concealing herself. Her mouth is often open in surprise, and she hides her body from view. However, although Nancy [...] "expresses surprise, she is not afraid. She appears to be a bit taken aback <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> sees, but she looks as if she is still in control of the situation." [...] Many of these covers feature Nancy poised in the observation of a clue, spying on criminal activity, or displaying her discoveries to others involved in the mystery. Only occasionally is she shown in action, such as running from the scene of a fire, riding a horse, or actively sleuthing with a flashlight. At times she is only involved in action as her hiding place has been discovered by others. In most cases, more active scenes are used for the frontispiece, or in books after 1954, illustrations throughout the text drawn by uncredited illustrators.|$|E

500|$|To avoid a {{scheduling}} {{conflict with}} Revolutionary Road, Winslet {{turned down an}} offer to star in The Reader. After her replacement Nicole Kidman left the project due to her pregnancy, Winslet was signed to it. Directed by Stephen Daldry, The Reader is based on Bernhard Schlink's novel {{of the same name}} and is about Hanna Schmitz, an illiterate Nazi camp guard (Winslet), who has an affair with a teenage boy. Winslet researched on the Holocaust and the SS guards, and was traumatised <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> learnt. To educate herself on the stigma attached to illiteracy, she spent time with students at the Literacy Partners, an organisation that teaches adults to read and write. A merkin was designed for her frontal nude scenes, but she refused to wear it. Winslet was unable to sympathise with Schmitz, saying that [...] "there was nothing of her that I could relate to", and struggled to find [...] "honesty and truthfulness" [...] to the part without humanising her actions. Despite this, certain historians criticised the film for making Schmitz an object of audience's sympathy and accused the filmmakers of Holocaust revisionism. Even so, Winslet's performance was acclaimed; the critic Todd McCarthy commended her for supplying [...] "a haunting shell to this internally decimated woman", and writing for The Daily Telegraph, Sukhdev Sandhu considered her to be [...] "absolutely fearless here, not just in her willingness to expose herself physically, but her refusal to expose her character psychologically".|$|E
500|$|Having {{just written}} the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft was {{determined}} to put her ideas to the test, and in the stimulating intellectual atmosphere of the French revolution she attempted her most experimental romantic attachment yet: she met and fell passionately in love with Gilbert Imlay, an American adventurer. Wollstonecraft put her own principles in practice by sleeping with Imlay despite not being married, which {{was not something that}} was considered acceptable behavior from a [...] "respectable" [...] British woman at the time. Whether or not she was interested in marriage, he was not, and she appears to have fallen in love with an idealized portrait of the man. While Wollstonecraft had rejected the sexual component of relationships in the Rights of Woman, Imlay awakened her passions and her interest in sex. Wollstonecraft was to a certain extent disillusioned <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> saw in France, writing that the people under the republic were still behaved slavishly to those who held power while the government remained [...] "venal" [...] and [...] "brutal". Despite her disenchantment, Wollstonecraft wrote: [...] "I cannot yet give up the hope, that a fairer day is dawning on Europe, though I must hesitatingly observe, that little is to be expected from the narrow principle of commerce, which seems everywhere to be shoving aside the principle of honor of the noblesse. For the same pride of office, the same desire of power are still visible; with this aggravation, that, fearing to return to obscurity, after having but just acquired a relish for distinction, each hero, or philosopher, for all are dubbed with these new titles, endeavors to make hay while the sun shines." [...] Wollstonecraft was offended by the way that the Jacobins refused to grant Frenchwomen equal rights, denounced [...] "Amazons", and made it clear the role of women was to conform to Rousseau's ideal of as a helper to men. On 16 October 1793, Marie Antoinette was guillotined with one of the charges that she been convicted of being she had committed incest with her son. Though Wollstonecraft disliked the former queen, she was troubled by the way that the Jacobins had made Marie Antoinette's alleged perverted sexuality that had caused her to engage in an incestuous relationship with the Dauphin one of the central reasons for why the French people should hate her. On 31 October 1793, most of the Girondin leaders were guillotined, which caused Wollstonecraft to faint when Imlay broke the news to her.|$|E
