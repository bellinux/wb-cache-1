He also believed that Catholicism and fraternalism could be compatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men to <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> their American-Catholic heritage.|$|E

For this reason, he reluctantly agrees to send Theon Greyjoy to his father, Lord Balon Greyjoy, to convince Lord Greyjoy to join them with all the naval force of the Iron Islands. While his mother Catelyn wishes to return to Winterfell {{to be with her}} sons Bran and Rickon, Robb asks her to travel to Renly's court to negotiate an alliance.

5|$|Bart gladly accepts Martin's offer, {{as there}} is no other way he could win over Nelson. Homer, however, feels betrayed by Bart's choice to drive Martin's racer instead of the one he helped Bart to make. When Bart tries to {{apologize}} to Homer, he selfishly denounces both Bart and Martin, telling Bart to do whatever he wants. Marge steps in and tells Homer that she has defended him through a lot of things over the years, but his latest actions prove that he is a bad father. As Bart gets ready to race in the final match with Martin's newly tuned racer, Homer thinks to himself about how selfish he has been, realizing that Bart needs his support regardless of whose racer he is using, and he rushes off to the race. At the starting line, Homer wishes Bart good luck and tells him that no matter how the race ends he will still <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> him. The race is tough as Nelson pulls every dirty trick in his arsenal, but eventually through his skill Bart finishes first and the team enjoys their victory.|$|E
5|$|Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) tells Aden that {{he should}} behave in a manner his {{grandfather}} would <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of.</b> This upsets Aden, and he tries to cause trouble at school. When Cassie discovers she has HIV, Aden becomes irate at the prospect {{that she may have}} infected him in the car accident. After his tests come back negative, he cries in disappointment. His doctor, Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews), suggests that Aden may need counselling, but he refuses. When Aden's alcoholic father Larry throws him out, he is taken in by his friend Roman. Aden is upset to learn that Roman was in the army like his grandfather, and visits the structurally damaged local diner to be alone. The ceiling collapses and Aden is seriously injured. In the aftermath, Larry tells Rachel that Aden was abused by his grandfather as a child. Aden cannot face going home, so moves in with Roman more permanently. He is attracted to Roman's daughter Nicole, but does not pursue her out of respect for Roman. Instead, Aden kisses Belle, but deflects her attempts to take things further. She goes on a date with Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz), which prompts a jealous Aden to admit that he could not sleep with her because of the abuse he suffered as a child. When Larry injures himself while drunk, he is found by his son, and admits that Aden's grandfather also abused him. Aden holds Larry, Rachel and Belle hostage so that his father cannot receive medical assistance, but they are rescued by Angelo.

5|$|Several years later, a {{new power}} had emerged in Asia. In 88 BC, a Roman army {{was sent to}} put down that power, king Mithridates VI of Pontus, but was defeated. Over the {{objections}} of the former Consul Gaius Marius, the Consul for the year, Lucius Cornelius Sulla was ordered by the senate to assume command of the war against Mithridates. Marius, {{a member of the}} democratic ("populare") party, had a Tribune revoke Sulla's command of the war against Mithridates, so Sulla, a member of the aristocratic ("optimate") party, brought his army back to Italy and marched on Rome. Marius fled, and his supporters either fled or were murdered by Sulla. Sulla had become so angry at Marius' Tribune that he passed a law that was intended to permanently weaken the Tribunate. He then returned to his war against Mithridates, and with Sulla gone, the populares under Marius and Lucius Cornelius Cinna soon took control of the city. The populare record was not one to <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of,</b> as they had reelected Marius Consul several times without observing the required ten-year interval. They also transgressed democracy by advancing un-elected individuals to magisterial office, and by substituting magisterial edicts for popular legislation. Sulla soon made peace with Mithridates, and in 83 BC, he returned to Rome, overcame all resistance, and captured the city again. Sulla and his supporters then slaughtered most of Marius' supporters, although one such supporter, a 17-year-old populare (and the son-in-law of Cinna) named Julius Caesar, was ultimately spared.|$|E
