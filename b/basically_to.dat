5|$|After a year, Matlock was {{promoted}} to Third Secretary in the Political Section. American foreign policy {{with regard to the}} Soviet Union, known as containment, had been articulated in 1947 by George F. Kennan, who was later to become a good friend of Matlock’s. The American policy was <b>basically</b> <b>to</b> contain the spread of Communism, in the expectation that it would eventually collapse of internal contradictions. This did not prevent discussions between the Superpowers. In June 1961, President John F. Kennedy and First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev met in Vienna, and in December the United Nations General Assembly approved a draft joint resolution on principles for negotiating disarmament. This period also saw the beginnings of U.S. - U.S.S.R. cultural exchanges, notably the visit of poet Robert Frost to Moscow.|$|E
25|$|Citing for the {{potential}} of the area for settlement and agricultural development, President Quezon declared the entire land area of Mallig Plains as project site for his program on rural development. In support of this declaration, he created the Office of National Land Settlement Administration which was renamed to Land Settlement Development Corporation (LaSeDeCo). Subsequently, this corporation was reorganized. At that time, the primary objective of LaSeDeCo was <b>basically</b> <b>to</b> oversee and facilitate the distribution of lands to qualified settlers. With the development of this opportunity for rural and agricultural development and with the completion of the Balete Pass Road in the 1920s that runs through the hinterlands of the Caraballo Mountains, hundreds of inhabitants from the Ilocos and Central Luzon regions opted to settle and avail of the program of the government in the Mallig Plains area.|$|E

[...] and her lead vocals on [...] "Gigantic", Albini {{moved the}} studio equipment and recorded {{in a studio}} bathroom to achieve real, rather than studio, echo; according to John Murphy, Deal's husband at the time, [...] "Albini didn't like the studio sound." [...] Albini later said that the record could have been completed in a week, but [...] "we ended up trying more experimental stuff <b>basically</b> <b>to</b> kill time and see if anything good materialized." [...] An example was [...] "Something Against You", where Albini filtered Black Francis' voice through a guitar amp for [...] "a totally ragged, vicious texture." ...|$|E

John Charles Thomas, representing the National District Attorneys Association, concluded [...] "The pressure is <b>basically</b> <b>to</b> {{err on the side}} of caution, to give the Miranda warning almost every time." [...] Professor Stephen Saltzburg of George Washington University agreed that the ruling would pressure police to adopt a strategy of [...] "When in doubt, give Miranda warnings", but also opined that it would make little practical difference to young people facing police questioning. [...] "The reality is that even with Miranda warnings, it's doubtful that young people understand exactly what it all means and understand their choices, and so in the long run, I doubt that there will be many fewer confessions because of this opinion." ...|$|E
500|$|By October 1999, {{the team}} had cut the game's {{multiplayer}} feature. Pearsall explained that Looking Glass did not [...] "have the resources to do {{a new kind of}} multiplayer and ship a finely tuned single-player game". Plans were announced in January 2000 to release a multiplayer-only Thief game shortly after the completion of Thief II. As Thief IIs development continued, Looking Glass experienced extreme financial troubles. The company's Marc LeBlanc later said that [...] "Eidos was writing a check every week to cover our burn rate" [...] during the last months of the project. The game's final cost was roughly $2.5 million. According to company head Paul Neurath, Eidos informed Looking Glass that [...] "it was not an option" [...] for Thief II to miss its release date, and that there would be [...] "dire consequences if [...] missed by even a day". An anonymous Looking Glass staffer later told Salon.com that Eidos [...] "told us <b>basically</b> <b>to</b> ship [...] by their fiscal quarter or die".|$|E
500|$|In {{his last}} full {{season with the}} Indians in 1955, Doby was {{selected}} for his seventh consecutive and final All-Star Game. Doby's leg injuries affected him severely {{at this point in}} his career and he did not enter the game. He finished the 1955 season with 26 home runs and 75 RBIs while hitting [...]291 in 131 games, his fewest played since 1948. Not all in Cleveland were disappointed to see Doby leaving. Wrote one Plain Dealer columnist, Franklin Lewis: [...] "He has been a controversial athlete. Highly gifted, he was frequently morose, sullen, and upon occasion, downright surly to his teammates... He thought of himself, at the beginning, as the symbol of the Negro in his league." [...] Doby responded, [...] "I was looked on as a Black man, not as a human being. I did feel a responsibility to the Black players who came after me, but that was a responsibility, <b>basically,</b> <b>to</b> people, not just to Black people." ...|$|E

500|$|The public {{portion of}} the beta {{consists}} of matchmaking play on three multiplayer maps: Valhalla, High Ground and Snowbound. The public beta also contained a limited version of the [...] "saved films" [...] feature, which allows players to save and watch their played games. The day the public beta began, problems were reported from owners of Crackdown {{that they could not}} download the beta. Bungie announced that the Microsoft team found a solution and that the issue would be resolved shortly; a patch was distributed for Crackdown that fixed the problem. Bungie also extended the beta until June 10 to compensate for the issue. According to Jerret West, global group product manager, allowing users into the beta created [...] "a psychological investment" [...] in the game. [...] "The idea was <b>basically</b> <b>to</b> make the beta launch huge and let the tastemakers make the launch for you... to really drive it beyond the gaming press." [...] The beta caused a spike in preorders for the retail version of the game.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong {{expressed}} dismay at the then-upcoming presidential election. He felt {{confused by}} the country's culture war, noting the particular division among the general public on the Iraq War. Summing up his feelings {{in an interview at}} the time, he said, [...] "This war that's going on in Iraq [...] <b>basically</b> <b>to</b> build a pipeline and put up a fucking Wal-Mart." [...] Armstrong felt a duty to keep his sons away from violent images, including video games and news coverage of the war in Iraq and the 9/11 attacks. Armstrong noted divisions between America's [...] "television culture" [...] (which he said only cared about cable news) versus the world's view of America, which could be considered as careless warmongers. Dirnt felt similarly, especially so after viewing the 2004 documentary Fahrenheit 9/11. [...] "You don't have to analyze every bit of information in order to know that something's not fucking right, and it's time to make a change." [...] Cool hoped the record would influence young people to vote Bush out, or, as he put it, [...] "make the world a little more sane." [...] He had previously felt that it was not his place to [...] "preach" [...] to kids, but felt there was so much [...] "on the line" [...] in the 2004 election that he must.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began on}} Monday, December 11, 1989, and lasted for seven days. The episode was {{directed}} by David Carson, who had only filmed one other Next Generation episode before [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise". Carson felt that his relative lack of experience helped {{because he had no}} preconceptions about how episodes should be directed. Since much of the episode took place in the darker alternate universe, Carson wanted to emphasize the toll that decades of war had taken on the crew and the bridge. [...] "Picard really looked tired and worn and like a battle-weary commander, and that's what we wanted the bridge to look like—a battle weary bridge. I had lots of thoughts about making it as strong as possible using a lot of low lights, a lot of dark blues, making it very much more moody", he said. To heighten the impact of the physical set changes, Carson took a different approach to how he constructed shots. [...] "It was my intention to make it as much like a submarine as possible and to use low-angle lighting; <b>basically,</b> <b>to</b> do everything the opposite way that the Enterprise was normally shot." [...] The cameras were equipped with longer lenses than usual {{in order to reduce the}} depth of the scenes and provide a grittier feel. The use of low angles forced the lighting to be modified to prevent the scene from, in Carson's words, looking [...] "like a hotel lobby".|$|E

2500|$|Later ethnographers and {{anthropologists have}} {{disagreed}} with Taplin's {{construction of the}} tribal federation of 18 lakinyeri (clans). Ian D. Clark has called it a [...] "reinvention of tradition". Norman Tindale and Ronald Murray Berndt in particular were critical both of Taplin, and of each other's reevaluation of the evidence. According to Tindale, a close evaluation of his material suggests that his data pertains <b>basically</b> <b>to</b> the Jarildekald/Yaralde culture, and he limited their borders to Cape Jervis, whereas Berndt and his wife argued that the Ramindjeri component lived in proximity to Adelaide. The Berndts argued that, despite cultural links, there was no political unity to warrant the 'nation' or 'confederacy'.|$|E

2500|$|After {{revaluation}} and {{the introduction}} of the new franc, many French people continued to use old francs (anciens francs), to describe large sums (throughout the 1980s and well in to the 1990s and virtually until the introduction of the euro, many people, old and young [...] even those who had never used the old franc [...] were still referring to the old franc, confusing people). For example, lottery prizes were most often advertised in amounts of centimes, equivalent to the old franc, <b>basically</b> <b>to</b> inflate the perceived value of the prizes at stake. Multiples of 10NF were occasionally referred to as [...] "mille francs" [...] (thousand francs) or [...] "mille balles" [...] ("balle" [...] being a slang word for franc) in contexts where {{it was clear that the}} speaker did not mean 1,000 new francs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of the people of Ireland were Catholic peasants; they were very poor and largely impotent politically during the eighteenth century, as many of their leaders converted to Protestantism to avoid severe economic and political penalties. Nevertheless, there was a growing Catholic cultural awakening underway. [...] There were two Protestant groups. [...] The Presbyterians in Ulster in the north lived in better economic conditions, but had virtually no political power. Power was held by a small group of Anglo-Irish families, who followed the Anglican Church of Ireland. [...] They owned the great bulk of the farmland, where the work was done by the Catholic peasants. [...] Many of these families lived in England and were absentee landlords, whose loyalty was <b>basically</b> <b>to</b> England. Many of the Anglo-Irish who lived in Ireland became increasingly identified as Irish nationalists, and were resentful of the English control of their island. [...] Their spokesmen, such as Jonathan Swift and Edmund Burke, sought more local control.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2014, state {{broadcaster}} China Central Television (CCTV) {{broadcast a}} news story further characterizing Windows 8 {{as a threat to}} national security.

Yang Min, a computer scientist at Fudan University, also stated that [...] "the security features of Windows 8 are <b>basically</b> <b>to</b> the benefit of Microsoft, allowing them control of the users' data, and that poses a big challenge to the national strategy for information security." [...] Microsoft denied the claims in a number of posts on the Chinese social network Sina Weibo, which stated that the company had never [...] "assisted any government in an attack of another government or clients" [...] or provided client data to the U.S. government, never [...] "provided any government the authority to directly visit" [...] or placed any backdoors in its products and services, and that it had never concealed government requests for client data.|$|E
