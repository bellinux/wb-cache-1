40|$|ABSTRACT: Boric acid {{is one of}} {{the widely}} used {{inorganic}} compound in pharmaceutical industry. We find its utilization as an antiseptic, in eye wash preparations, as an insecticidal, as a buffering agent etc. In this present work, a comparative study of the UV-Vis spectras of the <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>solution</b> in different solvents have been done. A variety of solvents like water, ethanol, methanol, glacial acetic acid, hexane, Tetrahydrofuran and 0. 2 M HCl solution have been employed for spectral analysis.

Below pH ~ 7. 1, the corrosion rate increases with decreasing pH and can reach ~ 100 µm/yr in solutions with pH less than ~ 6. 7.

40|$|Objectives: Aluminium {{phosphide}} (AlP) is a fumigant pesticide {{which protects}} stored grains from insects and rodents. When it comes {{into contact with}} moisture, AlP releases phosphine (PH 3), a highly toxic gas. No efficient antidote has been found for AlP poisoning so far and most people who are poisoned do not survive. Boric acid is a Lewis acid with an empty p orbital which accepts electrons. This study aimed to investigate the neutralisation of PH 3 gas with boric acid. Methods: This study was carried out at the Baharlou Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, between December 2013 and February 2014. The volume of released gas, rate of gas evolution and changes in pH were measured during reactions of AlP tablets with water, acidified water, saturated <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>solution,</b> acidified saturated <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>solution,</b> activated charcoal and acidified activated charcoal.

Although boric acid did not significantly reduce the volume of released gas, it significantly reduced the rate of gas evolution (P < 0. 01). A gaseous adduct was formed in the reaction between pure AlP and boric acid. Conclusion: These findings indicate that boric acid may be an efficient and non-toxic antidote for PH 3 poisoning...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Boron is an {{important}} micronutrient for plants, but high B levels in soils are often responsible for toxicity effects in plants. It is therefore important to understand reactions that may affect B availability in soils. In this study, Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was employed to investigate mechanisms of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> (B(OH) 3) and borate (B(OH) 4) adsorption on hydrous ferric oxide (HFO). On the HFO surface, <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> adsorbs via both physical adsorption (outer-sphere) and ligand exchange (inner-sphere) reactions. Both trigonal (<b>boric</b> <b>acid)</b> and tetrahedral (borate) boron are complexed on the HFO surface, and a mechanism where trigonal <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> in <b>solution</b> reacts to form either trigonal or tetrahedral surface complexes is proposed based upon the spectroscopic results. The presence of outer-sphere <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> complexes can be explained based on the Lewis acidity of the B metal center, and this complex {{has important implications for}} boron transport and availability. Outer-sphere <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> is more likely to leach downward in soils in response to water flow. Outer-sphere boron would also be expected to be more available for plant uptake than more strongly bound boron complexes, and may more readily return to the soil solution when solution concentrations decrease.
