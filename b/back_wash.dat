Then the winds fell, all but the north wind, which drifted Ulysses on for two days and nights.

Thrice he clasped a rock, and thrice the <b>back</b> <b>wash</b> of the wave dragged him out to sea.

Performance measures including coagulant demand, turbidity, colour, total organic carbon, head loss development, filter run time, <b>back</b> <b>wash</b> water consumption, filtration solids volume and iron and manganese were examined for a water source with low turbidity and high organic matter content. The optimal coagulant dosage established for in-line direct filtration was much lower than that required for conventional treatment of the same raw water. Direct filtration preceded by ozonation achieved similar, or substantially higher, turbidity removal efficiencies with a significantly lower alum coagulant dosage. Pre-ozonation was effective in lowering turbidity, colour, head loss development and iron and manganese levels but was not significant in removing TOC. Pre-ozonation increased filter run time by about 7 % when compared with the case of no ozonation treatment. The <b>back</b> <b>wash</b> consumption was 5 % of total water produced and solids volume produced by coagulation and direct filtration alone was 8 % of the <b>back</b> <b>wash</b> water used.

40|$|In The Netherlands, Belgium {{and other}} European countries, {{manganese}} {{is removed from}} groundwater by aeration followed by rapid (sand) filtration. Although manganese removal from groundwater has been studied extensively, the mechanisms that control the ripening of filter media are not yet fully understood. This thesis highlights {{the role of the}} formation of a manganese oxide coating on virgin filter media. Characterization and identification of the media revealed that Birnessite was the manganese oxide responsible for effective manganese removal. This study confirmed that Birnessite formed {{at the beginning of the}} ripening process was of biological origin. As filter ripening progressed, the origin of the Birnessite became predominantly physico-chemical, although biological manganese oxidation still contributed to the overall removal of manganese. The formation of Birnessite at the start of filter media ripening was negatively influenced by a high filter <b>back</b> <b>wash</b> frequency. Molecular DNA analyses showed that Pseudomonas species are most likely involved at the start of the manganese oxide formation process. Based on the knowledge that manganese removal in conventional groundwater treatment is initiated biologically, long ripening times may be reduced by creating conditions favouring the growth of manganese oxidizing bacteria, e. g., by limiting the <b>back</b> <b>wash</b> frequency and/or intensity. Finally it was shown that the use of freshly prepared manganese oxide, containing Birnessite, can completely eliminate the need for filter media ripening. The results of this research enable the development of an innovative manganese removal process to shorten or completely eliminate long periods of ripening of virgin filter media, as well as significantly prolonging the lifetime of the filter media. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Water is a {{precious}} and necessary good for humans. We make great {{use of it}} be it for industry or urban use. In consequence its quality is altered and generates what we denominate waste waters. This water has to be treated to prevent {{negative impact on the}} environment. To avoid this there are waste water treatments. Conventional treatments in waste water treatment plants are composed of physic-chemical and biological treatments. But those water treatment plants present limitations that difficult improvement of the process. This limitations can be balanced out by integrating other advanced technologies of waste water treatment that will improve the treatment and generate better quality water diminishing the impact on the environment. One of those systems is called membrane bioreactor (MBR). This process generates much better water quality but has two big inconvenient: the operational cost and the membrane fouling. The membrane fouling is due to particle accumulation on the surface, negatively affecting water filtration. Fouling is detected by the increase in trans-membrane (TMP) pressure. In consequence there is an increment on the energetic cost and when accumulated it can damage the membrane. There exist different measures to help reduce fouling. Systems like the application of airing to create turbulence and detach fouling. Also periodical <b>back</b> <b>wash</b> process to release obstructed pores or chemical washes to recover filter capacity even though it reduces the membrane useful life. All these measures imply direct actions on the membranes. What we study is the option to apply an external peptic treatment that coats the membrane surface, able to prevent bio-fouling from membranes. With this treatment we could reduce <b>back</b> <b>wash</b> frequency, airing flow or even chemical washes. Therefore we can reduce operational costs from this technology increasing its profitability.

This overcomes the common problem of ascertaining accurate field measurements in the energetic swash zone of a gravel beach where damage to equipment is commonplace.

Predictions are validated against field observation and result in a vertical RMS error of 17 cm for run up and 18 cm for <b>back</b> <b>wash.</b> The method alleviates the need for manual digitisation of swash events as has previously been commonplace, enabling swift creation of large datasets for validation of empirical formulae.

Monitoring changes in permeate flux and separation efficiency, we made an effort to predict the possibility of <b>back</b> <b>wash</b> and the breakthrough point. During the initial operation, contamination of membrane surface was increased gradually without changes in inner pores whereas a long-term operation exhibited a decrease in inner pores and a change in microfibril, suggesting {{that there would be a}} rare possibility for backwashing. As the suction pressure was raised from 1 atm to greater than 2 atm due to the increased membrane surface contamination with 40 days of operation, the permeate flux and suction pressure were required to be continuously monitored. The results of more than 100 days of operation suggested that backwashing was not possible due to fouling. (C) 2009 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

The core research contribution of this thesis was to examine whether suitable, non-time critical, algorithms could be developed for deployment on these style of systems. The objective being to use the existing industry standard low frequency signals, for fault detection and diagnosis, condition based control and performance monitoring. This has indicated the potential for applying academic research in a new fashion across industry to improve operational efficiency. A representative SCADA system was used and the work focussed on the industrial water infrastructure in a deep bed filtration plant, a coal fired power station and a gas turbine research establishment. In the water filtration plant innovative software was developed which diagnosed the location of pipe work blockages. A second programme was developed which passively monitored system variables, giving an indication of filter bed fouling and detecting abnormal system conditions. This functionality was used to provide a robust fault tolerant condition based backwash strategy for the filters. A third programme utilised a novel, threshold based, approach to diagnose the individual severity of combined blockages, allowing condition based <b>back</b> <b>wash</b> to continue, even under extreme abnormal blockage conditions. The second area considered was based upon a cooling process located in a power station. An ideal condenser performance surface was successfully assimilated into SCADA software infrastructure, thus vastly improving on existing manual monitoring approaches and providing operators with real time efficiency information. Associated work at a gas turbine research facility demonstrated the further scope for gathering and displaying efficiency information using SCADA software. The work undertaken proved that a research approach can be encapsulated in non-time critical, low frequency algorithms suitable for application to supervisory systems.

40|$|Raw {{water of}} {{reservoirs}} has high colour and low turbidity while river water normally has low colour and high turbidity. Organic matters carried with run off water accumulate {{at the bottom}} of reservoirs. Reservoir waters being stationary provides a friendly environment for algal growth and colour development from decomposition of those and some inorganic ion such as Iron & Manganese from soil. So treatment of reservoir water is to be focused on colour removal rather than turbidity removal. It has been found that colour removal requires high coagulant dosage than turbidity removal and purification of reservoir water gives rise to operational problems in the conventional treatment systems such as short filter run with filter clogging and filter bed cracking. Kalatuwawa Water Treatment Plant has been constructed in 1954 with design capacity of 20 mgd. It is a conventional type treatment plant having the following processes, Aeration, Pre-chlorination, Coagulation, Flocculation, Sedimentation, Filtration Post chlorination and pH correction. Raw water is drawn off to the treatment plant from the Kalatuwawa impounding reservoir and the treated water is conveyed to Greater Colombo area under gravity feed and contributes 16 mgd to the total supply of Greater Colombo. In the course of filtration, clean filter media gradually gets clogged. After about one month, small cracks on the surface of filters starts to appear and these cracks develop into large openings with mud ball formation in continuation of the filtration process. So it has been difficult to reduce the colour to acceptable level during high colour period as settled water passes through openings without filtration. This has been a long-standing problem, which has not received a proper solution so far. Objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the reasons for filter clogging & filter cracking and find solutions to overcome this problem with improvement of colour removal efficiency. The analysis of the problem was divided into two parts. In the first part, the possible contributory factors from the reservoir up to filters were investigated. Physical & operational factors which may contribute to the problem in the filters themselves were investigated in the second part. A pilot filter was set up in parallel to the existing filters and run more than one year with increased <b>back</b> <b>wash</b> rate and air scouring and found to be operating without clogging and cracking problem in media. Similarly the applicability of clay and settled sludge as coagulant aid, and PAC as colour adsorbent was investigated for the purpose of improving settling and colour removal efficiency in order to reduce the filter load during high colour period. The chemical analysis done for raw water reveals that colour of Kalatuwawa water has developed primarily from organic substances with iron. Organic colour substances come from decomposition of vegetation and Iron from bottom soil. This study investigated the possibility of filter clogging and cracking due to algal growth in the reservoir water and found no significant algal count in raw water to clog filters Through Jar test analysis, it appears that clay and settled sludge can be applied as a coagulant aid in conjunction with Alum and these reduce colour in the settled water to satisfactory level with use of optimum dosage. Addition of Powered Activate Carbon as adsorbent to flocculation basin was found to reduce colour to minimal amount. Applying pre- chlorination is necessary to remove iron from water, as aeration alone is not able to do so. Increased <b>back</b> <b>wash</b> rate up to 36 m 3 /m 2 fhr with air scouring system gives adequate bed expansion and cleaning to filter media. Therefore this study leads to the conclusion that increased backwash rate with improvement of settling would solve the cracking and clogging problem of the filters. Similarly it requires the rehabilitation and modification of filter under drain system...|$|E
