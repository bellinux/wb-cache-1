This is especially a challenge for the state of Arizona, which has a high incidence of <b>skin</b> <b>cancer.</b> The inconsistent evidence-based practice guidelines for <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> prevention create challenges for counseling adolescents. The knowledge, attitudes, and practices of primary <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> prevention by nurse practitioners who care for adolescents is unknown in Arizona or elsewhere in the U. S. Purpose: This doctor of nursing practice project investigates knowledge, attitudes, and practices of <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> primary prevention by Arizona nurse practitioners caring for adolescents on an outpatient basis and determines congruency of their counseling with primary prevention guidelines. Methods: The design is descriptive cross-sectional. An online survey using Qualtrics software was distributed via professional listservs to eligible Arizona nurse practitioners currently in practice.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> of the basal and squamous cell types is extremely low among genetically black-skinned human beings, whereas {{these types of}} <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> are common among Caucasians, especially {{those who live in}} geographic areas of high sun exposure. Ultraviolet B light (UVB) is thought to be the primary oncogenic agent in sunlight. We have recently demonstrated that acute, low-dose exposure of Caucasian skin to UVB impairs the inducting of contact hypersensitivity to dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) in approximately 40 % of normal individuals. Importantly, this trait – termed UVB susceptibility–was found to be characteristic of virtually 100 % of patients with a history of biopsy-proved <b>skin</b> <b>cancer,</b> implying that UVB susceptibility may be a risk factor for this disease. Because melanin pigment is thought to he protective of some of the deleterious effects Of UVB radiation, we have examined the capacity of a low-dose regimen of UVB to alter induction of contact hypersensitivity in individuals with genetically melanized or heavily tanned skin. Our results indicate that UVB radiation depletes heavily pigmented skin of Langerhans cells, just as it does in Caucasian skin. Moreover, UVB-susceptibility exists as a polymorphic trait in individuals with genetically determined <b>black</b> <b>skin,</b> as well as in individuals with heavily tanned skin, and the {{incidence of}} this trait is similar to that found among normal Caucasian subjects. Thus, melanin does not appear to protect against the deleterious effects of an acute, low-dose regimen of UVB on induction of cutaneous immunity, and the UVB susceptibility trait is equally well-represented in both black- and Caucasian-skinned individuals. We conclude that although UVB susceptibility may function as a risk factor for <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> in Caucasians, it does not function similarly in black-skinned human beings, probably because melanin effectively protects against the mutagenic properties of UVB radiation...|$|R

There are over 5 million new cases of {{keratinocyte}} <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> (KC) (previously known as non-melanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer)</b> and over 65, 000 new cases of melanoma annually in the United States. <b>Skin</b> <b>cancer</b> is highly preventable, although prevention methods are not commonly practiced. Nurse practitioners have a key role in educating and encouraging patients to practice <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> prevention methods. Purpose/Aims: The purpose of this project was to determine whether a brief educational video can improve nurse practitioner knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> and <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> prevention counseling. Methods: A single subject pre-test post-test design guided this project. Participants completed an online pretest assessing <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Following the pretest participants were given access to the video intervention. The intervention included information about <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> and published guidelines about <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> prevention counseling. Changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors and satisfaction with the intervention were assessed through a post-test. Results: A total of 30 eligible Arizona nurse practitioners completed both the pretest and posttest surveys. There was a statistically significant increase (p=. 000) in knowledge from 64. 17 % on the pretest to 87. 5 % on the posttest. Attitudes about <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> and <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> counseling were fair on the pretest and significantly improved (p=. 000) on the posttest. On the pretest, nurse practitioners had poor attitudes regarding <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> prevention counseling practice behaviors. These attitudes favorably increased (p=. 009) on the posttest.

They were asked about knowledge of <b>skin</b> <b>cancer,</b> perception of physicians 2 ̆ 7 performance and <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> screening in general. Data are mainly presented in a descriptive manner. For statistical analyses, Mann-Whitney U test and Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s chi-square test were used. Results: Knowledge about sunburn in childhood and high ultraviolet exposure as <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> risk factors increased during SCREEN. Simultaneously, the awareness for early detection of <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> increased significantly from 41. 3 to 74. 0...|$|R
40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to The University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Medicine. Background: One {{out of every three}} cancer diagnoses is a <b>skin</b> <b>cancer,</b> and the incidence of both melanoma and non‐melanoma type <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> is increasing. <b>Skin</b> <b>cancers,</b> including melanoma, are typically treatable if detected early. However, there is insufficient evidence to support recommendations to establish population based <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> screening programs. The specific aims of this study are 1) to evaluate characteristics of participants who attend a community <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> screening event and who are referred for follow up due to suspicious lesions, 2) to determine the proportion of participants with suspicious lesions identified at a community <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> screening event who complied with a request to visit a dermatologist or primary care physician, and 3) to evaluate attitudes toward sun protection practices, and perceived risk of developing <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> among participants who attend a community <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> screening and have a suspicious skin lesion. Methods: The <b>Skin</b> <b>Cancer</b> Institute sponsored a series of community <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> screening events in Tucson, Arizona from 2006 to 2013. Participants completed an American Academy of Dermatology screening form prior to a skin examination by a dermatologist. Participants with suspicious lesions identified at the examination who agreed to be contacted again received questionnaires 4 months after the initial screening to assess compliance with follow‐up recommendations, and their sun protection practices and risk perceptions. Results: 1979 community members attended the <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> screenings. The majority of the participants were Caucasian, females, had blue eyes and brown hair, were college educated, had no prior personal or family history of <b>skin</b> <b>cancer,</b> had health insurance but did not have a regular dermatologist, reported that they had never been to a <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> screening before, and stated that without this screening that they would not have their skin examined. 748 (37. 8...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Skin</b> <b>cancer</b> is {{the most}} {{commonly}} diagnosed cancer in the United States. The majority of <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> is nonmelanoma cancer, either basal cell cancer or squamous cell cancer. The inci-dence of both melanoma and nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> has been increasing over the past 3 decades. In 2001, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found insufficient evidence to recom-mend for or against routine screening for <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> by using whole-body skin examination for early detection of <b>skin</b> <b>cancer.</b> Purpose: To update the evidence of {{benefits and harms of}} screen-ing for <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> in the general population. Data Sources: MEDLINE and Cochrane Library searches from 1 June 1999 to 9 August 2005 for English-language articles; recent systematic reviews; reference lists of retrieved articles; and expert suggestions.
