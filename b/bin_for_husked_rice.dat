After 84 days of a static aerobic composting process, full-scale comparison was investigated in maturity, organic nutrient and sanitarian properties. The {{results showed that the}} treatment of corn stalk co-composting with swine waste at 1 : 1. 5 ratio {{with the addition of a}} biological agent was the first to achieve maturity and had a higher level of organic fertiliser quality, and hygienic indicators of the compost product were satisfied within the relevant standards for harm. Meanwhile, the effect of the biological agent on acceleration of degradation was verified in corn stalk composting. This study found <b>rice</b> <b>husk</b> compost did not reach ideal high temperature. The maturity effect of the final product was relatively poor. Except the treatment of <b>rice</b> <b>husk</b> mixing swine manure at 1 : 2 ratio with biological agent, other treatments of <b>rice</b> <b>husk</b> had lower and less-effective products, no positive effect was observed in the <b>rice</b> <b>husk</b> compost. At the end of this paper some suggestions were given to develop new approaches <b>for</b> <b>rice</b> <b>husk</b> utilisation and reduce the cost of corn stalk co-composting...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the solid particle flow characteristics and biomass gasification in a clapboard-type internal circulating fluidized bed reactor. The effect of fluidization velocity on particle circulation rate and pressure {{distribution in the}} bed showed that fluidization velocities in {{the high and low}} velocity zones were the main operational parameters controlling particle circulation. The maximum internal circulation rates in the low velocity zone came almost within the range of velocities in the high velocity zone, when uH/umf =  2. 2 - 2. 4 <b>for</b> <b>rice</b> <b>husk</b> and uH/umf =  3. 5 - 4. 5 for quartz sand. In the gasification experiment, the air equvalence ratio (ER) was the main controlling parameter. <b>Rice</b> <b>husk</b> gasification gas had a maximum heating value of around 5000  kJ/m 3 when ER =  0. 22 - 0. 26, and sawdust gasification gas reached around 6000 - 6500  kJ/m 3 when ER =  0. 175 - 0. 24. The gasification efficiency of <b>rice</b> <b>husk</b> reached a maximum of 77 % at ER =  0. 28, while the gasification efficiency of sawdust reached a maximum of 81 % at ER =  0. 25.
