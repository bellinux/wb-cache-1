50|$|In May 2008, {{groundwater}} contamination {{was reported}} to the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) following detection at Santos's Port Bonython site, Spencer Gulf, South Australia. Hydrocarbons were found floating on and in the groundwater. One hundred and fifty inspection wells were later established, and a 450 m cement <b>bentonite</b> <b>wall</b> was constructed 'to stop the further spread of contamination off-site' including to the marine environment. In May 2012, Santos reported declining rates of hydrocarbon recovery from groundwater extraction wells and claimed that their remediation efforts were working.|$|E
40|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1980 s the Netherlands has been confronted with its industrial history, due to some cases of severe subsurface contamination. The former gasworks site in the city of Utrecht {{was one of the main}} cases. The surrounding neighborhood had been promised a park, which would be named after the Grift River that flows through the park: The Griftpark. After years of discussion the best approach was chosen, the contamination would be sealed within a 1. 2 kilometer long and 60 meter deep <b>Bentonite</b> <b>wall.</b> This wall had to prevent spreading of contaminated water. The actual park was built on topsoil with clean sand. To guarantee that no contaminated water would flow out of the park, an everlasting, groundwater lowering, pumping scheme was implemented. The extracted water has been brought to its own purification plant ever since. After 15 years of containment of the contaminants in the subsurface within the Bentonite walls and sanitation of the area outside the Bentonite walls, positive signals indicated that an endless solution might be possible. The biological decay goes faster than expected, new research techniques and remediation methods are developed and the environmental policy has changed. This environmental policy gives possibilities in terms of horizontal spreading, but the drinking water regulations regarding the protection of the second aquifer have been tightened. All together the municipality of Utrecht sees enough reasons to investigate whether safe control of the pollution is also possible with less active measures, for example by increasing the self-remediating capacity of the subsurface or to make use of the extracted water. A group of experts has defined a couple of promising scenarios that the municipality of Utrecht would like to research. There are however 2 barriers: 1. The current state of the subsurface pollution within the Bentonite walls is unknown. After 1992 hardly any research has been done and the size and depth of the contamination has not been determined. 2. There is no knowledge about the geohydrological impact of the defined scenarios, a validated model is missing. This research is divided in two: 1. The first part describes the built up and validation of a geohydrological and solute transport model for the Griftpark and the surrounding area. 2. The second part uses the model created as a tool to answer the questions outlined next: a. What soil volume, located within the Bentonite walls, has the highest risk of contaminant spreading towards the second aquifer? b. Which of the scenarios defined by the group of experts has most potential in terms of contamination control and cost/benefit? c. What happens to the fastest spreading, most polluting contaminants within the high risk area in the promising scenarios? Summarized the conclusions are: A. About 1 / 3 th of the total volume of the Griftpark proposes a direct risk to the water in the second aquifer. This area is located around the ‘hole’ in the Kedichem clay layer. This ‘hole’ in the Kedichem clay layer is the main gateway for water flow from the first aquifer to the second aquifer, because the sand that is present instead of the clay, has got a hydraulic conductivity that is almost a 1000 times larger. B. The most promising scenarios are: Scenario 1, an optimized form of the current situation with minimal discharge and only one working pumping well (B 20) can help to reduce the costs and still maintain the controlled situation. This is no finite solution, but reduces the costs significantly, while further research can investigate the other options. Scenario 2, turning off the pumping wells while monitoring the water that flows from the first to the second aquifer can significantly reduce the pumping costs. No contaminated water is allowed to reach the second aquifer, but as long as the monitored water remains clean, it is allowed to spread freely and there is no need to pump it. When contaminated water is observed, the pumping wells have to be turned on again. Scenario 4, the optimized Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) system can potentially create benefit by storing heat and in the meantime increase biological degradation. More research is needed to determine whether this measure has potential. It has to be implementable and a useful application of the heat stored has to be present. Scenarios 5 and 6, these scenarios cover part of the Griftpark or the whole Griftpark reducing the amount of infiltration, so less extraction is needed for the current situation to be maintained. C. The amount of spreading and biological degradation is calculated, but the decay constants and retardation factors chosen largely influence the outcome. More research is needed before real conclusions can be drawn...|$|E

40|$|The study {{investigations}} {{were focused}} on assessing {{the influence of a}} 35 -year-old municipal waste landfill on environmental mercury pollution. The total Hg content was determined in the soil profile, groundwater, and the plants (Solidago virgaurea and Poaceae sp.) in the landfill area. Environmental pollution near the landfill was relatively low. The topsoil layer, groundwater and the leaves of Solidago virgaurea and Poaceae sp. contained 19 - 271 μg kg- 1, 0. 36 - 3. 01 μg l- 1, 19 - 66 μg kg- 1 and 8 - 29 μg kg- 1 of Hg, respectively. The total Hg content in the soil decreased with the depth. The results are presented as pollution maps of the landfill area based on the total Hg content in the soil, groundwater and plants. Statistical analysis revealed the lack of correlation between the total Hg content in the soil and plants, but a relationship between the total concentration of Hg in groundwater and soil was shown. The landfill is not a direct source of pollution in the area. The type of land morphology did not influence the pollution level.

40|$|This work {{is mainly}} {{directed}} towards problems of ground stability and ground deformations caused by tunnelling and deep excavation in clay. The particular question of surface settlement associated with soft ground tunnelling has been critically examined. Derivation of semi-empirical relationships has facilitated settlement prediction. A detailed analysis {{has been carried}} out on the results of an extensive research programme of in-situ measurements aimed at determining ground movements created by a) hand excavation of a 4. 146 m diameter shield-driven tunnel at a depth of 29. 3 m below ground surface, and b) the excavation of a 6. 1 m long, 0. 8 m wide and 15 m deep <b>bentonite</b> slurry-supported diaphragm <b>wall.</b> Both engineering structures were situated in the stiff fissured, over consolidated London Clay. The stress-strain regime around the tunnel and behind the diaphragm wall was examined, and a theoretical analysis was attempted in order to provide an explanation for the actual performance of both structures during the early stages of construction...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bentonite</b> in slurry <b>walls</b> {{needs to}} be amended with organo-clay to control the {{migration}} of organic contaminants. Consolidation behaviour of the slurry {{is important because it}} will reduce the total effective stress owing to mobilisation of frictional force between the side wall of the trench and the slurry. Compressibility of the slurry of bentonite is expected to undergo significant changes owing to amendment with organo-clay and according {{to the nature of the}} fluid. Standard one-dimensional consolidation tests were carried out on slurries of bentonite, organo-clay and their mixtures by remoulding them to their respective liquid limit consistency with water as well as fluids of low polarity, such as carbon tetrachloride, and inundating with different fluids. Organo-clay and its mixture with bentonite when moulded with water exhibit lower compressibility than bentonite in any pore fluid, but their compressibility increases when moulded with carbon tetrachloride and inundated with the same fluid. These changes in the compressibility of bentonite amended with organo-clay are explained by particle rearrangements, changes in the development of the diffuse double layer and contribution from the water adsorbed in the inter-lamellar space of the clay...|$|R
40|$|Past {{activities}} at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal have resulted in contamination of the near surface shallow alluvial aquifer. Under orders to cease and desist off-site discharge of contaminated groundwater, the U. S. Army has constructed the north boundary barrier system (NBBS) to block critical migration pathways. This system involves arrays of pumping wells, recharge wells and trenches, and a <b>bentonite</b> slurry cut-off <b>wall.</b> Because of complex hydrogeologic conditions at the arsenal, this system has proven very difficult to manage. In response Colorado State University (CSU) and U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, have entered into cooperative research with the aims of evaluating {{the performance of the}} system and to investigate reconfiguration of the NBBS to improve operational flexibility and performance. In this study a very detailed model was developed to simulate the operation of the system using the CSU Finite Element Groundwater Modeling Package. To account for aquifer heterogeneities which can significantly affect the operational effectiveness of the system, geostatistical analysis were also performed. Kriging and Co-kriging were used to describe the spatial variability of several aquifer properties and the results incorporated in the numerical model. Several operational scenarios were simulated to asses system improvements and define optimal operational schemes that achieve a reverse gradient across the slurry wall. Scientific visualization techniques were implemented to illustrate modeling results. The experiences (difficulties and successes) learned in operating the north boundary barrier system at the Rocky mountain Arsenal should be valuable to others desiring to use similar barrier systems elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} amount of numerical and experimental {{research has been conducted}} to study the vibration isolation by wave barriers considering open trenches, in-filled concrete or <b>bentonite</b> trenches, sheet-pile <b>walls,</b> and rows of piles. A few studies have investigated the use of expanded polystyrene (EPS) geofoam material as wave barriers, which indicated that in-filled geofoam trenches can be used as effective wave barriers. However, no engineering design method is available to date for the design of such type of wave barriers. This dissertation presents comprehensive experimental and numerical investigations on the use of in-filled geofoam trench barriers to scatter machine foundations vibration, in order to provide some recommendations and design guidelines for their implementation in design. Two- and three-dimensional time-domain finite element models have been developed utilizing the finite element package ABAQUS. The numerical models have been verified and then used to study the effectiveness of different configurations of in-filled geofoam wave barriers. All the proposed configurations performed well in scattering surface waves. However, the single-continuous wall system was considered to be more economic and practical alternative for wave scattering. Based on the findings of the preliminary numerical investigations, a full scale field experimental study has been conducted to investigate the performance of in-filled geofoam trenches. An innovative approach to construct geofoam trenches involving hydro-dig technology was utilized. A series of experimental tests have been conducted to evaluate the performance of both open and in-filled geofoam trench barriers considering their geometry and distance from the source of disturbance. The results of the field experimental investigations were analyzed and interpreted to provide recommendations for implementation in design. Experimental results confirmed that in-filled geofoam trench barriers can effectively reduce the transmitted vibrations and its protective effectiveness is comparable to the open trench barrier. An extensive numerical parametric study was conducted to investigate the behaviour of in-filled geofoam wave barrier under different soil conditions and to point out the key parameters that dominate the performance of in-filled geofoam trench barriers. The influence of various key parameters on the screening performance were carefully analyzed and discussed. A model using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis was developed for design purpose. Finally, an artificial neural network (ANN) model has been developed, which aims at extrapolating the parametric study results to predict the in-filled geofoam wave barrier protective effectiveness in different soil profiles with different geometric dimensions...|$|R
