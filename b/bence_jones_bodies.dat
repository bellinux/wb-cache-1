500|$|While police {{questioned}} potential {{suspects and}} witnesses, other investigators focused on processing the crime scene. Repeated {{attempts were made}} to find the bullet that had passed through <b>Jones's</b> <b>body</b> and the murder weapon, including the sifting of dirt at the crime scene for bullets and the deployment of a troop of Boy Scouts to search for a gun. A [...]22 caliber rifle slug was eventually found buried in the ground where <b>Jones's</b> <b>body</b> had been found, providing evidence {{that at least some of}} her wounds had been sustained at the place her body was found. Though investigators went so far as to drag the bottom of nearby bodies of water, the gun that had shot Jones—assumed to be a [...]22 caliber pistol—could not be found. Buildings near where <b>Jones's</b> <b>body</b> had been located were also searched for blood and gunshot evidence, in accordance with police's theory that Jones had been attacked elsewhere and then transported outdoors. A [...] "white, powdery substance" [...] found in Jones's hair was initially believed to a trace evidence of some other crime scene area—an idea which fueled the search of nearby buildings—but was later determined to be fly eggs.|$|R

25|$|On November 18, 1978, Jones {{was found}} dead on a deck chair with a gunshot wound to his head that Guyanese coroner Cyrill Mootoo stated was {{consistent}} with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. However, Jones's son Stephan believes his father may have directed someone else to shoot him.

5000|$|During the autopsy, 29 pellets from an {{air rifle}} were found lodged in Jones's skin. Forensic {{pathologist}} Christopher Milroy {{testified that the}} gun must have been fired from the short distance of a few feet for the pellets to have penetrated the skin. Some pellets were in <b>Jones's</b> <b>body</b> {{for quite some time}} and he said Jones showed signs of lead poisoning, although the level was not high enough to poison her. She was likely shot with at least two of those pellets after the scalding. She also had nine fractured ribs, a broken nose, two black eyes and many cuts, bruises and scrapes on her head, knees and legs. Milroy said these injuries were caused after Jones was burned on November 24, 2009. <b>Jones's</b> <b>body</b> had other injuries including seven calloused ribs, which suggested an earlier fracture likely caused by kicks, as well as two recent rib fractures, a broken left finger, fractured right wrist and an earlier forearm break known as a [...] "nightstick fracture", caused by a blow to the arm raised in a defensive position. Joel Fish, medical director of the burn unit of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, testified as a burn expert. According to Fish, had Jones received proper medical treatment, she would have had a [...] "virtually 100 per cent" [...] chance of survival.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} days of the Overland Campaign of 1864, Jones was killed at the Wilderness while {{attempting}} to rally his wavering men.

5000|$|Hutt claimed {{at first}} that Jones had fallen into a fire pit, then later that he had accidentally burned his wife 11 days earlier with a {{pot of boiling water}} and had tried to treat her at home after she refused to go to the hospital. About 40% of <b>Jones's</b> <b>body</b> had been burned. [...] Although Jones spoke to a handful of people on the phone after the scalding, {{including}} her mother, she didn't tell anyone she was hurt nor call 911 herself. The Crown attorney argued Jones was protecting Hutt because of a “trauma bond”. Friends of Jones made a third-party complaint to police alleging Hutt’s abuse the day after Jones was scalded, but it was left uninvestigated until after her body was found.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), a premalignant plasma-cell disorder {{has not been}} determined in our geographic area Nigeria. Methods A cross sectional survey was carried on apparently healthy Nigerians selected by multistage sampling technique from the cosmopolitan city of Lagos, Nigeria. Subjects enrolled into the study had 2 -step screening for the presence, type and concentration of monoclonal band. Agarose-gel electrophoresis was performed on all serum samples, and any serum sample with a discrete band of monoclonal protein or thought to have a localized band was subjected to Immunofixation. Subjects were also evaluated for <b>Bence</b> <b>jones</b> proteinuria, haematological and biochemical parameters. Results Four hundred and ten subjects {{with a mean age}} of 45. 68 [*]±[*] 10. 3 years, a median of 45. 00 years and a range of 20 to 80 years were enrolled into the study. MGUS was identified in only one (0. 24 percent) of the 410 study subject. This subject was demonstrated to have a double monoclonal gammopathy; IgGλ at 16. 9 g/L and IgAκ at 8. 5 g/L. None of them including the sole subject with MGUS had a monoclonal urinary light chain. Conclusion Among residents of Lagos, Nigeria, MGUS was found in only 0. 24 % percent of apparently normal persons with a median age of 45 years. This suggests that MGUS which represents the earliest stage of monoclonal plasma/lymphoid cell proliferation is not a common finding in the relatively young population of Nigeria. Future epidemiologic studies dealing with plasma cell disorders in older people are required to carefully examine the relationship between environmental factors and {{prevalence of}} MGUS and its ultimate progression to MM. </p...|$|R

It is age-related and characterized by accumulation of bone marrow plasma cells derived from a single abnormal clone. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the pattern of MGUS in North Indian urban population. Methods: Serum and urine samples were collected from 320 suspected cases of gammopathy, were analyzed by sensitive immunological technique based protein electrophoresis followed by immunofixation for detection and type of monoclonal/polyclonal gammopathies. Twenty-five healthy subjects were included as controls. Results: Gammopathies were observed in 38 (11. 88 %) patients. Out of these 7. 5 % were &not;monoclonal and 4. 3 % were polyclonal. Overall age of presentation of these monoclonal &not;gammopathies in both sexes was between 21 and 76 years. Gender-related ratio (men:women) for these gammopathies was 1 : 1. 18. Predominant heavy chain isotype was IgG (62. 5 %) followed by IgA (37. 5 %). Among light chains, kappa (&kappa;) and lambda (&lambda;) chains appeared in 91. 6 % and 8. 4 % gammopathies respectively. Paraprotein fractions obtained were IgG&kappa; (58. 3 %), IgG&lambda; (4. 16 %), IgA&kappa; (33. 3 %), and IgA&lambda; (4. 16 %) with 25 % samples being positive for Bence Jones proteinuria. Conclusions: Clinical laboratories play an important role in confirming the immunological diagnosis of gammopathies. Determination of nature of paraproteinemia and its associated diseases calls for more extensive studies in India.

2500|$|In 1905, Jones's {{remains were}} {{identified}} by U.S. Ambassador to France Gen. Horace Porter, who had searched for six years {{to track down the}} body using faulty copies of Jones's burial record. Thanks to the kind donation of a French admirer, Pierrot Francois Simmoneau, who had donated over 460 francs, <b>Jones's</b> <b>body</b> was preserved in alcohol and interred in a lead coffin [...] "in the event that should the United States decide to claim his remains, they might more easily be identified." [...] Porter knew what to look for in his search. With the aid of an old map of Paris, Porter's team, which included anthropologist Louis Capitan, identified the site of the former St. Louis Cemetery for Alien Protestants. Sounding probes were used to search for lead coffins and five coffins were ultimately exhumed. The third, unearthed on April 7, 1905, was later identified by a meticulous post-mortem examination by Doctors Capitan and Georges Papillault as being that of Jones. The autopsy confirmed the original listing of cause of death. The face was later compared to a bust by Jean-Antoine Houdon.|$|R
5000|$|Jones lies {{exhausted}} in the jungle, {{unable to}} find any of the supplies he had hidden. As darkness falls, and the drumbeats become louder and more insistent, he is beset by hallucinations from his past life. When he sees {{a vision of the}} man he had murdered in a crap game, he starts running through the jungle, tearing off pieces of his uniform until he is left in rags. He then has visions of a convict gang with a guard, and a slave auction with the auctioneer calling Jones to the block. He fires his gun at the phantoms until he has used up all his bullets save the silver one he wears around his neck. In a moment of lucidity, he reflects on his past life and probable fate and sings a negro spiritual, [...] "It's Me, O Lord, Standin' in de Need of Prayer". At dawn, he is still trying to find {{his way out of the}} jungle when a witch doctor appears. He grabs Jones and starts dancing wildly around him. When he is surrounded by the soldiers and natives who have been hunting him, Jones realizes that all is lost, puts the silver bullet into his gun, places the gun against his head and fires. Smithers stands over the dead Emperor and utters the final words of the opera: [...] "Dead as an 'erring. Well, Gor blimey, yer died in a grand style any'ow."
