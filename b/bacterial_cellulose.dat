25|$|As the Earth’s {{most common}} organic material, {{cellulose}} {{can be classified}} into plant cellulose and <b>bacterial</b> <b>cellulose,</b> {{both of which are}} naturally occurring. Plant cellulose, which makes up the cell walls of most plants, is a tough, mesh-like bulkwork in which cellulose fibrils are the primary architectural elements. While <b>bacterial</b> <b>cellulose</b> has the same molecular formula as plant cellulose, it has significantly different macromolecular properties and characteristics. In general, microbial cellulose is more chemically pure, containing no hemicellulose or lignin, has a higher water holding capacity and hydrophilicity, greater tensile strength resulting from a larger amount of polymerization, ultrafine network architecture. Furthermore, <b>bacterial</b> <b>cellulose</b> can be produced on a variety of substrates and can be grown to virtually any shape due to the high moldability during formation. Additionally, <b>bacterial</b> <b>cellulose</b> has a more crystalline structure compared to plant cellulose and forms characteristic ribbon-like microfibrils.

25|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>bacterial</b> <b>cellulose</b> is a multistep process that involve two main mechanisms: the {{synthesis of}} uridine diphosphoglucose (UDPGIc), followed by the polymerization of glucose into long and unbranched chains (the β-1→4 glucan chain). Specifics on the cellulose synthesis has been extensively documented. The former mechanism is well known while the latter still needs exploring. The production of UDPGIc starts with carbon compounds (such as hexoses, glycerol, dihydroxyacetone, pyruvate, and dicarboxylic acids) entering the Krebs cycle, gluconeogenesis, or the pentose phosphate cycle depending on what carbon source is available. It then goes through phosphorylation along with catalysis, followed by isomerization of the intermediate, and {{a process known as}} UDPGIc pyrophosphorylase to convert the compounds into UDPGIc, a precursor to the production of cellulose. The polymerization of glucose into the β-1→4 glucan chain has been hypothesized to either involve a lipid intermediate or not to involve a lipid intermediate, though structural enzymology studies and in vitro experiments indicate that polymerization can occur by direct enzymatic transfer of a glucosyl moiety from a nucleotide sugar to the growing polysaccharide. A. xylinum usually converts carbon compounds into cellulose with around 50% efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Degradation {{of cotton}} {{cellulose}} by Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase I (EGI) and cellobiohydrolase II (CBHII) was investigated {{by analyzing the}} insoluble cellulose fragments remaining after enzymatic hydrolysis. Changes in the molecular-size distribution of cellulose after attack by EGI, alone and in combination with CBHII, were determined by size exclusion chromatography of the tricarbanilate derivatives. Cotton cellulose incubated with EGI exhibited a single major peak, which with time shifted to progressively lower degrees of polymerization (DP; number of glucosyl residues per cellulose chain). In the later stages of degradation (8 days), this peak was eventually centered over a DP of 200 to 300 and {{was accompanied by a}} second peak (DP, (apprx=) 15); a final weight loss of 34 % was observed. Although CBHII solubilized approximately 40 % of <b>bacterial</b> microcrystalline <b>cellulose,</b> the cellobiohydrolase did not depolymerize or significantly hydrolyze native cotton cellulose. Furthermore, molecular-size distributions of cellulose incubated with EGI together with CBHII did not differ from those attacked solely by EGI. However, a synergistic effect was observed in the reducing-sugar production by the cellulase mixture.

Recombinant enzymes were constructed with single and double copies of CBD 2 fused at the N-terminus of BGL 1 to mimic the two-domain organization displayed by cellulolytic enzymes in nature. The engineered S. fibuligera β-glucosidases were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of phosphoglycerate-kinase- 1 promoter (PGK 1 P) and terminator (PGK 1 T) and yeast mating pheromone α-factor secretion signal (MFα 1 S). The secreted enzymes were purified and characterized using a range of cellulosic and non-cellulosic substrates to illustrate the effect of the CBD on their enzymatic activity.

Expression of the hybrid gene in Escherichia coli yielded up to 50 mg of the hybrid protein, CexCBDCbhI, per liter of culture supernatant. The hybrid was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on cellulose. The relative association constants (Kr) for the binding of Cex, CexCBDCbhI, the catalytic domain of Cex (p 33), and CbhI to <b>bacterial</b> microcrystalline <b>cellulose</b> (BMCC) were 14. 9, 7. 8, 0. 8, and 10. 6 liters g- 1, respectively. Cex and CexCBDCbhI had similar substrate specificities and similar activities on crystalline and amorphous cellulose. Both released predominantly cellobiose and cellotriose from amorphous cellulose. CexCBDCbhI was {{two to three times}} less active than Cex on BMCC, but significantly more active than Cex on soluble cellulose and on xylan. Unlike Cex, the hybrid protein neither bound to alpha-chitin nor released small particles from dewaxed cotton fibers...|$|R

To investigate the possible use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{as a candidate for}} consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) of cellulose to ethanol, four fungal cellobiohydrolase (CBH) encoding genes (Trichoderma reesei cbh 1 and cbh 2, Aspergillus niger cbhB and Phanerochaete chrysosporium cbh 1 – 4) were expressed in this yeast. All four CBHs were successfully expressed and similar extracellular activity was demonstrated on phosphoric acid swollen <b>cellulose</b> (PASC) and <b>bacterial</b> microcrystalline <b>cellulose</b> (BMCC) using a modified affinity digestion procedure. Our results suggest that although heterologous CBHs can be produced in S. cerevisiae the titers of functionally secreted CBH are relatively low. However, the specific activity of recombinant CBH 1 on PASC and BMCC, determined by a sensitive ELISA-based technique, was found not to differ significantly from that of the native T. reesei enzyme. Given this similarity in specific activity, but the disparity between current levels of CBH expression relative to expression levels required to enable growth on crystalline cellulosic substrates with concomitant ethanol production, future studies should aim to increase the expression levels of CBHs...|$|R
