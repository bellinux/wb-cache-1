5|$|Viral {{epidemiology}} is {{the branch}} of medical science that deals with the transmission and control of virus infections in humans.

Another, more rare, example is the varicella zoster virus, which, although causing relatively mild infections in humans, can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby.|$|E

25|$|It is {{customary}} for the brit {{to be held}} in a synagogue, but it {{can also}} be held at home or any other suitable location.

If the <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> <b>born</b> on Sunday before sunset, the Brit will be held the following Sunday. However, if the <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> <b>born</b> on Sunday night after sunset, the Brit is on the following Monday.

25|$|In {{the weeks}} after a human <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> <b>born,</b> as its nervous system matures, neural {{patterns}} in sleep begin to show a rhythm of REM and non-REM sleep. (In faster-developing mammals this process occurs in utero.) Infants {{spend more time in}} REM sleep than adults. The proportion of REM sleep then decreases significantly in childhood. Older people tend to sleep less overall but sleep in REM for about the same absolute time, and therefore spend a greater proportion of sleep in REM.|$|E
25|$|Gestational {{diabetes}} affects 3–9% of pregnancies, {{depending on}} the population studied. It is especially common {{during the last three}} months of pregnancy. It affects 1% of those under the age of 20 and 13% of those over the age of 44. A number of ethnic groups including Asians, American Indians, Indigenous Australians, and Pacific Islanders are at higher risk. In 90% of people gestational diabetes will resolve after the <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> <b>born.</b> Women, however, are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.|$|E
25|$|There {{are special}} risks to {{consider}} for older adults, {{women who are}} pregnant, and babies. When a person ages, the body becomes less able to rid itself of barbiturates. As a result, people {{over the age of}} sixty-five are at higher risk of experiencing the harmful effects of barbiturates, including drug dependence and accidental overdose. When barbiturates are taken during pregnancy, the drug passes through the placenta to the fetus. After the <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> <b>born,</b> it may experience withdrawal symptoms and have trouble breathing. In addition, nursing mothers who take barbiturates may transmit the drug to their babies through breast milk. A rare adverse reaction to barbiturates is Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which primarily affects the mucous membranes.|$|E

25|$|Prevention {{involves}} decreasing known {{risk factors}} including if possible procedures {{associated with the}} condition and giving the medication oxytocin to stimulate the uterus to contract shortly after the <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> <b>born.</b> Misoprostol may be used instead of oxytocin in resource poor settings. Treatments may include: intravenous fluids, blood transfusions, and the medication ergotamine to cause further uterine contraction. Efforts to compress the uterus using the hands may be effective if other treatments do not work. The aorta may also be compressed by pressing on the abdomen. The World Health Organization has recommended non-pneumatic anti-shock garment to help until other measures such as surgery can be carried out. In 2017 study found that tranexamic acid decreased a woman's risk of death.|$|E
