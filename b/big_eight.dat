5|$|As {{a sophomore}} in 1962, {{his first year}} on the varsity team, Sayers led the <b>Big</b> <b>Eight</b> Conference and was third in the nation with 1,125 rushing yards. His 7.1 yards-per-carry average was the highest of any player in the NCAA that season. Against Oklahoma State, he carried 21 times for a conference single-game-record 283 yards to lead Kansas to a 36–17 {{comeback}} victory. In 1963, Sayers set an NCAA Division I FBS record with a 99-yard run against Nebraska. He finished the year with 917 rushing yards, again leading all rushers in the <b>Big</b> <b>Eight.</b> He earned first-team All-America recognition from the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), The Sporting News, and United Press International (UPI), among others. In 1964, his senior year, he led the Jayhawks to a 15–14 upset victory over Oklahoma with a 93-yard return of the game's opening kickoff for a touchdown. He finished the year with 633 rushing yards, third most among <b>Big</b> <b>Eight</b> rushers, and also caught 17 passes for 178 yards, returned 15 punts for 138 yards, and returned seven kickoffs for 193 yards. He earned first-team All-America honors {{from each of the}} same selectors as in the previous year, in addition to the Associated Press (AP), among others.|$|E
5|$|The Kansas Jayhawks {{football}} {{program is a}} college football team that represents the University of Kansas in the Big 12 Conference in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The team has had 36head coaches and one interim head coach since it started playing organized football in 1890 with the nickname Jayhawks. They played their first season without a head coach. Kansas joined the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1907. After several changes, the conference eventually became the <b>Big</b> <b>Eight</b> Conference. The Jayhawks became a charter member of the Big 12 in 1996 when the <b>Big</b> <b>Eight</b> disbanded. The Jayhawks have played in 1,179games during their 120seasons. In those seasons, seven coaches have led Kansas to postseason bowl games: George Sauer, Jack Mitchell, Pepper Rodgers, Don Fambrough, Bud Moore, Glen Mason and Mark Mangino. Four coaches have won conference championships with the Jayhawks: A. R. Kennedy, Bill Hargiss, Sauer and Rodgers.|$|E
5|$|The Nebraska Cornhuskers {{began the}} 1996 season having won the {{national}} championship in both 1994 and 1995. Though Nebraska was {{now a member of}} a new conference—the former <b>Big</b> <b>Eight</b> Conference had been merged with four Texas schools to become the Big 12—it was widely expected that Nebraska would repeat the performance for a third time in 1996.|$|E

5|$|The Missouri Tigers {{football}} {{program is a}} college football team that represents the University of Missouri in the East Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The team has had 31head coaches since it started playing organized football in 1890 with the nickname Tigers. Missouri joined the Western Interstate University Football Association in December 1891, later winning the conference championship {{three years in a}} row. The conference disbanded after the 1897 season and Missouri remained independent until joining the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1907. After several changes, the conference eventually became the <b>Big</b> <b>Eight</b> Conference. The Tigers became a charter member of the Big 12 in 1996 when the <b>Big</b> <b>Eight</b> disbanded. Missouri subsequently left the Big 12 following the 2011 season and joined as the 14th member of the SEC effective for the 2012 season. The Tigers have played 1,180games during their 119seasons. In those seasons, seven coaches have led Missouri to postseason bowl games: Don Faurot, Chauncey Simpson, Dan Devine, Al Onofrio, Warren Powers, Larry Smith, and Gary Pinkel. Nine coaches have also won conference championships with the Tigers: Harry Orman Robinson, C. D. Bliss, Bill Roper, Chester Brewer, John F. Miller, Gwinn Henry, Faurot, Simpson and Devine.|$|E
5|$|With {{the growth}} of bowl games, it became {{difficult}} to determine a national champion in a fair and equitable manner. As conferences became contractually bound to certain bowl games (a situation known as a tie-in), match-ups that guaranteed a consensus national champion became increasingly rare. In 1992, seven conferences and independent Notre Dame formed the Bowl Coalition, which attempted to arrange an annual No.1 versus No.2 matchup based on the final AP poll standings. The Coalition lasted for three years; however, several scheduling issues prevented much success; tie-ins still took precedence in several cases. For example, the <b>Big</b> <b>Eight</b> and SEC champions could never meet, since they were contractually bound to different bowl games. The coalition also excluded the Rose Bowl, arguably the most prestigious game in the nation, and two major conferences—the Pac-10 and Big Ten—meaning that it had limited success. In 1995, the Coalition {{was replaced by the}} Bowl Alliance, which reduced the number of bowl games to host a national championship game to three—the Fiesta, Sugar, and Orange Bowls—and the participating conferences to five—the ACC, SEC, Southwest, <b>Big</b> <b>Eight,</b> and Big East. It was agreed that the No.1 and No.2 ranked teams gave up their prior bowl tie-ins and were guaranteed to meet in the national championship game, which rotated between the three participating bowls. The system still did not include the Big Ten, Pac-10, or the Rose Bowl, and thus still lacked the legitimacy of a true national championship.|$|E
5|$|After {{a decline}} that {{lasted more than}} a decade, Oklahoma again won the {{national}} championship in 2000, after coach Bob Stoops had been hired the previous year. By then Oklahoma had joined a new conference, the Big 12 conference, {{a combination of the}} <b>Big</b> <b>Eight</b> Conference and four Texas schools of the Southwest Conference. Since becoming head coach, Stoops has won ten conference championships, while no other team in the Big 12 has more than three. Through the 2016 season, Oklahoma has compiled an overall record of 872 wins, 321 losses, and 53 ties. The Sooners have won 46 conference championships and have appeared in 50 bowl games, most recently in the 2017 Sugar Bowl.|$|E

50|$|Penn State instead faced Alabama for the {{national}} title in the Sugar Bowl, and the Orange Bowl found itself with a selection dilemma. Nebraska earned the <b>Big</b> <b>Eight's</b> automatic Orange Bowl berth {{by virtue of its}} victory over the Sooners, but, with Penn State and Notre Dame (which accepted an invitation to the Cotton Bowl Classic) off the board, the Orange Bowl committee decided to set up a bowl rematch with Oklahoma to create the best possible matchup. This was the last time a non-championship postseason bowl featured two teams from the same conference until the 2015 Arizona Bowl, and remains the last non-championship bowl to be a rematch of a regular-season conference game.|$|R
5|$|Football was {{introduced}} to the university by John A. Harts in 1895. Harts was a student from Kansas who had played the game in his home state. The university had its first paid coach in Vernon L. Parrington, who led the Sooners to a record of ninewins, oneloss, and twoties over four seasons. Bennie Owen brought Oklahoma to the national stage during his 22-year tenure as head coach. He retired with a 122–54–16 record, including four seasons in which the team went unbeaten. During Owen's tenure, Oklahoma became a charter member of the Southwest Conference, in which they remained for fiveyears before leaving to join the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association. The MVIAA conference would later transform into the Big Six, Big Seven, and finally the <b>Big</b> <b>Eight</b> Conference.|$|E
5|$|Sayers was {{recruited}} by several major Midwestern colleges {{before deciding to}} play college football at the University of Kansas. While being interviewed during a broadcast of a Chicago Cubs game on September 8, 2010, Sayers said he had originally intended {{to go to the}} University of Iowa. Sayers said that he decided against going to Iowa after the Iowa head coach, Jerry Burns, did not have time to meet Sayers during his one campus visit. During his Jayhawks career, he rushed for 2,675 yards and gained a <b>Big</b> <b>Eight</b> Conference-record 4,020 all-purpose yards. He was three times recognized as a first-team All–Big Eight selection and was a consensus pick for the College Football All-America Team in both 1963 and 1964.|$|E
5|$|The 1950s saw {{the rise}} of yet more dynasties and power programs. Oklahoma, under coach Bud Wilkinson, won three {{national}} titles (1950, 1955, 1956) and all ten <b>Big</b> <b>Eight</b> Conference championships in the decade while building a record 47-game winning streak. Woody Hayes led Ohio State to two national titles, in 1954 and 1957, and dominated the Big Ten conference, winning three Big Ten titles—more than any other school. Wilkinson and Hayes, along with Robert Neyland of Tennessee, oversaw {{a revival of the}} running game in the 1950s. Passing numbers dropped from an average of 18.9 attempts in 1951 to 13.6 attempts in 1955, while teams averaged just shy of 50 running plays per game. Nine out of ten Heisman trophy winners in the 1950s were runners. Notre Dame, one of the biggest passing teams of the decade, saw a substantial decline in success; the 1950s were the only decade between 1920 and 1990 when the team did not win at least a share of the national title. Paul Hornung, Notre Dame quarterback, did, however, win the Heisman in 1956, becoming the only player from a losing team ever to do so.|$|E

The team has had 22head coaches since organized football began in 1901 with the nickname Aggies. The team played without a head coach until 1906. The university, then known as Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College, was renamed Oklahoma State University in 1957 and its nickname was changed to Cowboys. Oklahoma State was an original member of the Southwest Conference, joining in 1915. They later joined the Missouri Valley Conference in 1925 and the <b>Big</b> <b>Eight</b> Conference in 1960. The Cowboys became a charter member of the Big 12 in 1996. The Cowboys have played in more than 1,000games during their 108seasons. In those seasons, eightcoaches have led the Cowboys to postseason bowl games: Jim Lookabaugh, Cliff Speegle, Jim Stanley, Jimmy Johnson, Pat Jones, Bob Simmons, Les Miles and Mike Gundy.
