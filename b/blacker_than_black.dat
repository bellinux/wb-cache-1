In the 19th century, it was the fashion for men both in {{business}} and for evening wear, {{in the form of}} a black coat whose tails came down the knees. In the evening it was the custom of the men to leave the women after dinner to go to a special smoking room to enjoy cigars or cigarettes. This meant that their tailcoats eventually smelled of tobacco. According to the legend, in 1865 Edward VII, then the Prince of Wales, had his tailor make a special short smoking jacket. The smoking jacket then evolved into the dinner jacket. Again according to legend, the first Americans to wear the jacket were members of the Tuxedo Club in New York State. Thereafter the jacket became known as a tuxedo in the U.S. The term [...] "smoking" [...] is still used today in Russia and other countries.The tuxedo was always black until the 1930s, when the Duke of Windsor began to wear a tuxedo that was a very dark midnight blue.

40|$|The current {{research}} examined {{the viability of}} the N 400, an event-related potential (ERP) related to the detection of semantic incongruity, as an index of both stereotype accessibility and interracial prejudice. Participants EEG was recorded while they completed a sequential priming task, in which negative or positive, stereotypically black (African American) or white (Caucasian American) traits followed the presentation of either a black or white face acting as a prime. ERP examination focused on the N 400, but additionally examined N 100 and P 200 reactivity. Replicating and extending previous N 400 stereotype research, results indicated that the N 400 can indeed function as an index of stereotype accessibility in an interracial domain, as greater N 400 reactivity was elicited by trials in which the face prime was incongruent with the target trait than when primes and traits matched. Furthermore, N 400 activity was moderated by participants self-reported explicit bias. More explicitly biased participants demonstrated greater N 400 reactivity to stereotypically white traits following <b>black</b> faces <b>than</b> <b>black</b> traits following black faces.

40|$|Seed {{heteromorphism}} {{observed in}} many halophytes is an adaptive phenomenon toward high salinity. However, {{the relationship between}} heteromorphic seed germination and germination-related hormones under salt stress remains elusive. To gain an insight into this relationship, the roles of gibberellins (GAs) and abscisic acid (ABA) in regulating germination of Suaeda salsa dimorphic brown and black seeds under salinity were elucidated by studying the kinetics of the two hormones during germination of the two seed types with or without salinity treatment. Morphological analysis suggested that brown and black are in different development stage. The content of ABA was higher in dry brown <b>than</b> in <b>black</b> seeds, which gradually decreased after imbibition in water and salt solutions. Salt stress induced ABA accumulation in both germinating seed types, with higher induction effect on <b>black</b> <b>than</b> brown seeds. <b>Black</b> seeds showed lower germination percentage than brown seeds under both water and salt stress, which might be attributed to their higher ABA sensitivity rather than the difference in ABA content between black and brown seeds. Bioactive GA 4 and its biosynthetic precursors showed higher levels in brown <b>than</b> in <b>black</b> seeds, whereas deactivated GAs showed higher content in <b>black</b> <b>than</b> brown seeds in dry or in germinating water or salt solutions. High salinity inhibited seed germination through decreasing the levels of GA 4 in both seeds, and the inhibited effect of salt stress on GA 4 level of black seeds was more profound than that of brown seeds. Taken together higher GA 4 content, and lower ABA sensitivity contributed to the higher germination percentage of brown seeds <b>than</b> <b>black</b> seeds in water and salinity; increased ABA content and sensitivity, and decreased GA 4 content by salinity were more profound in <b>black</b> <b>than</b> brown seeds, which contributed to lower germination of <b>black</b> seeds <b>than</b> brown seeds in salinity.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Obesity is more {{prevalent}} among <b>Black</b> women <b>than</b> <b>Black</b> men, {{but there is}} little information on the correlates of obesity in Blacks. This study describes the relations of sociodemographic factors and health behaviors to body mass index in a southern, Black population. METHODS. In 1988, a community probability sample of 1784 Black adults, aged 25 to 50, was examined in Pitt County, NC. RESULTS. More women than men were at least 20 % overweight (57 % vs 36 %). The relation of socioeconomic status (a composite of education and occupation) to age-adjusted body mass index level was inverse in women but not in men. Body mass index did not differ with either current energy intake or energy expenditure. Smokers and drinkers had lower age-adjusted levels than non-smokers and abstainers. CONCLUSIONS. Since the excess body mass index levels associated with low socioeconomic status in women could not be explained after controlling for adverse health behaviors, further epidemiologic study of risk factors for obesity in Black women is recommended...|$|R
40|$|In 1994, as the Michigan {{legislature}} considered {{whether to}} continue a law banning physician-assisted suicide, we {{conducted a series of}} surveys on this topic. One of these surveys, conducted in Detroit, was designed to measure the attitudes of a largely black population toward physician-assisted suicide. Questionnaires were mailed to 500 residents of Detroit. The questionnaire described a plan for legalizing physician-assisted suicide, called Plan A, that incorporated eligibility standards and safeguards to minimize abuse. Attitudes on three issues were investigated: 1) Should physician-assisted suicide be banned or legalized? 2) Should voluntary euthanasia also be permitted? 3) Might respondents request legalized physician-assisted suicide for themselves? Majorities of both whites and blacks supported Plan A; however, support was much lower among <b>blacks</b> <b>than</b> whites. <b>Blacks</b> were also less likely to support voluntary euthanasia or to envision asking for physician-assisted suicide themselves. Our analysis indicates that when age and sex are held constant, strength of religious commitment may account for much of the black-white difference in attitudes. We also consider alternative explanations based on cultural attitudes and degree of trust in the medical system...|$|R
