The high <b>breeding</b> success <b>and</b> survival of quails are provided in full compliance with ecological and technological conditions and requirements with the introduction of modern technologies. The results display the significant influence of ambient light, temperature, wind, humidity, feeding mode on the success of laying, incubation, growth and development of young animals. The optimal sex ratio in groups of quails at the cell contents is 1 : 4. The Melitopol region mainly breeds quails of "Pharaoh" and "Texas White" strains. The future prospects and development directions of quail breeding in the Zaporozhye region are discussed.

Based on the analysis of statistical information, materials of the Department of Agriculture and Food Resources of the Vologda Oblast the author analyzes the change in the value of milk production, identifies municipal regions where agricultural producers boost agricultural economics, describes trends in the structure of livestock in 2000 – 2014. The work shows that the major resource potential for the dairy cattle breeding development in the region is concentrated in Vologdsky District, Gryazovetsky District and Cherepovetsky District. The analytical grouping helps determine that given current market conditions, state of material and technical base of the industry and level of state support it is economically feasible to increase the productivity of cows to 7083 kg, as it allows to reduce unit costs and enhance profitability. However, for agricultural producers to raise the productivity of dairy cattle, it is necessary to implement systematic measures for their promotion on the part of public authorities. The article draws special attention to the scale of modern technological means used by agricultural enterprises for keeping, milking and feeding cows, {{as well as to the}} measures undertaken to improve <b>breeding</b> <b>and</b> <b>productive</b> qualities of cattle.

40|$|International audienceIt is {{generally}} expected that animals, including marine organisms, travel at speedsachieving the minimum energetic cost of transport. However, several factors cause variation inspeeds within the energetically acceptable range. Light intensity {{is known to}} affect movementspeeds in some flying and walking insects, which reduce speeds at low light levels. This isexplained as compensation for degraded temporal resolution of vision in dim light by maintainingthe rate of information gained per unit of travelling distance. Such a relationship between ambientlight intensity and movement speeds is expected for any visual system in principle, but has notbeen examined in any marine species. As a mesopelagic forager, king penguins Aptenodytespatagonicus regularly commute between their <b>breeding</b> colonies <b>and</b> <b>productive</b> foraging areasover several hundreds of kilometres. During these trips, they experience a wide variation in lightintensity between day and night, as well as within daylight hours, as dives often reach deeperthan 100 m. The present study investigated diel patterns in the swim speeds of king penguins inrelation to light intensity experienced within dives. King penguins gradually decreased theircruising speeds around dusk and increased them again around dawn. This resulted in consistentlyslower speeds in nocturnal dives. Correspondingly, the underwater light levels estimated werealways higher in diurnal dives, even at depths greater than 100 m. The slower swim speeds afterdusk may facilitate travelling and occasional prey detection in the dark. These results suggest thata common behavioural response to ambient light levels has evolved in different taxa of animals...|$|R

We sought to determine the most <b>productive</b> vegetation categories <b>and</b> seasonal aspects associated with Cx. annulirostris <b>breeding</b> <b>and</b> control operations in these wetlands. By applying a generalized linear model to compare larval densities and aerial control efforts for each vegetation category, we found that Schoenoplectus reeds were the most productive vegetation type in May and June and {{were associated with the}} greatest amount of control required.

Humpback whale calls were present during nine and eleven months of 2008 and 2009, respectively. In 2008, calls were present in January through April, June through August, November and December, whereas in 2009, calls were present throughout the year, except in September. Calls occurred in un-patterned sequences, representing non-song sound production. Typically, calls occurred in bouts, ranging from 2 to 42 consecutive days with February, March and April having the highest daily occurrence of calls in 2008. In 2009, February, March, April and May had the highest daily occurrence of calls. Whales were estimated to be within a 100 km radius off PALAOA. Calls were also present during austral winter when ice cover within this radius was > 90 %. These results demonstrate that coastal areas near the Antarctic continent are likely of greater importance to humpback whales than previously assumed, presumably providing food resources year-round and open water in winter where animals can breathe...|$|R

Não foi observada diferença significativa (P> 0, 05) entre as fontes de óleo nem entre os níveis de vitamina E para nenhuma das variáveis estudadas. Conclui-se que qualquer fonte de óleo das utilizadas neste estudo pode ser adicionada à ração de galos reprodutores sem necessidade de elevados níveis de vitamina E. The {{objective of}} this study was evaluate <b>breeding</b> <b>and</b> <b>productive</b> performance of Lohmann- LSL roosters. A total of 112 breeding roosters from 16 to 32 weeks of age were allotted to a randomized block design in a 3 x 2 + 1 factorial arrangement, with three sources of oil (soybean, canola and sunflower in 3 %of inclusion) and two levels of antioxidant (200 and 400 mg of vitamin E/kg of diet) and the control diet (without oil and 0 mg of supplementation of vitamin E). The experimental diets were made based on corn and soybean meal. At 28 and 29 weeks, semen collection was performed for evaluation of sperm motility, semen volume, concentration and number of total cells. At 29 weeks of age, semen collection was performed to evaluate sperm morphology, rate of osmotic resistance and heat-resistance of spermatozoa. Four roosters per treatment were slaughtered at 30 weeks of age for removal of the testes which were weighted and a sample was obtained for evaluation of the thickness of the seminiferous epithelium, diameter and the population of seminiferous tubule cells. Blood samplings were collected for evaluation of triglycerides and cholesterol. During the experimental period from 16 to 30 weeks, feed intake and total weight gain were evaluated. The true fertility test was performed at 32 weeks of age. The data were evaluated by analysis of variance using the SAEG program. Significant interaction (P< 0. 05) was found between sources of oil and the levels of vitamin E as well as among the sources of oils for total weight gain, seminiferous epithelium thickness and body weight at 30 weeks of age. Significant difference (P< 0. 05) was verified among the levels of vitamin E for the levels of triglycerides, cholesterol and body weight at 30 weeks of age. It should be concluded that any ource of oil used in this study may be added to the breeding rooster diet without the need to increase the levels of vitamin E...|$|R
