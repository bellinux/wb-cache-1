25|$|Box turtles are North American turtles of {{the genus}} Terrapene. Although box turtles are superficially similar to {{tortoises}} in terrestrial habits and overall appearance, they are actually members of the American pond turtle family (Emydidae). The twelve taxa which are distinguished in the genus are distributed over four species. They are largely characterized by having a domed shell, which is hinged at the bottom, allowing the animal to close its shell tightly to escape predators. Box turtles have become popular pets, although their needs in captivity are complex. The females usually have yellowish, <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> the males usually have red or orange eyes, but the most reliable manner to distinguish males from females {{is to examine the}} plastron: on males there is a concave area centered beneath the hinge.|$|E

He used to have his own webzine called Crackhead but had to disband it after an editorial that stated the merits of Linux over Windows, which caused a loss in advertisers and funds. Shortly after this, Michael decided to start a band called Skinner Box (name suggested by Mia), which refers to an experiment by the behavioural psychologist B. F.
