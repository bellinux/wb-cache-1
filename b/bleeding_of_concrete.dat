40|$|The {{adaptability}} {{to cement}} pastes and fresh concretes of aminosulphonic acid-based superplasticizer (ASP) and its water reducing ratio and compatibility with Naphthalene based superplasticize (FDN) {{have been investigated}} at a given content of ASP. The adaptability to cement pastes was determined by measuring the fluiditiy with time of superplasticized cement pastes, and the adaptability to fresh concretes and compatibility with FDN was evaluated by measuring the fluidity, bleeding, and hardening and mechanical property et. al. of fresh concretes with ASP. The {{results show that the}} fluidities at 120 min of cement pastes, with 1. 6 % of ASP, are over 140 mm, and it increases with the increase of ASP. There is a positive relationship between the water reducing ratios of ASP and its content, and the highest of the water reducing ratio(the highest value is 28 %). Moreover, the simultaneous addition of ASP and FDN can effectively decrease the <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> Adding the water reducing agent to concretes is an important method to prepare high-performance concrete [1 - 2]. However, the drawback of slump-loss of the concretes, which was, is and will be improved.

40|$|The {{intensive}} {{use of natural}} aggregates, near cities and towns, associated to the increase of the global population, leads to its depletion and increases the transport distances. The uncontrolled deposition of construction and demolition waste in landfills and city outskirts, causes pollution and takes up space. The use of recycled aggregates in concrete preparation would contribute to mitigate the problem. However, it arises the problem that the high water absorption of recycled aggregate decreases the <b>bleeding</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>concrete,</b> and when this gets lower than the evaporation rate, plastic shrinkage cracking occurs. This phenomenon can be particularly problematic in hot and windy curing environments. Cracking facilitates the flow of liquid and gas into concrete which attacks the reinforcement and degrades the concrete. These factors reduce the durability <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> structures and consequently the lifetime of buildings. A ring test was used, cured in a wind tunnel, to evaluate the plastic shrinkage cracking sensitivity <b>of</b> recycled aggregate <b>concrete,</b> in order to implement preventive means to control this phenomenon.

40|$|The <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> cement pastes, cement mortars, and {{concrete}} is due {{primarily to the}} self-weight consolidation of the granular skeleton formed by the solid constituents thereof.

Linear finite- and small-strain analytical solutions <b>of</b> <b>bleeding</b> as a consolidation process that account {{for the effects of}} hydration are presented and then validated by comparison with laboratory data for cement pastes {{and concrete}}s. Contrary to earlier assertions that a finite-strain model is required to model bleeding, the new finite- and small-strain solutions model the <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> the relatively shallow specimens analysed equally well. However, further research is necessary to establish whether small-strain solutions can model adequately the <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> comparatively deep <b>concrete</b> layers, and methods of determining the values of input parameters for the new solutions are also required.

The reduction in bond of horizontally embedded bars located in the upper sections of structural elements {{as opposed to those}} located near the bottom is known as the “top-bar effect”. It is influenced by several factors including the properties <b>of</b> the <b>concrete,</b> the position and the shape of the bars, the methods <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> placement, and the type of formwork.

Pull-out tests were carried out to determine the bond strength between reinforcing steel bars and concrete. Two optimized SCC mixtures with slump flow values larger than 700 mm and a control concrete with a slump of 20 - 30 mm were investigated. The results show that the maximum bond strength not always decreases when the diameter of the steel bar increases from 10 to 12 to 16 mm or when a lower strength class is used.

The rate of hydration and most cement properties depend on the fineness of the cement particles. The research indicated that increasing cement fineness increase the rate of heat generation. The advantage of increasing the fineness is in the increase of the early age strength of cement. Previous research has indicated that for a rapid development of strength high fineness is necessary. Research indicated that an increase in fineness of cement slightly improves the workability <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> mix, but its likely to have a detrimental effect on loss of workability as cement with a higher rate of hydration will loose workability more rapidly. In addition, excessive heat of hydration in hot dry conditions is likely to have a damaging effect and may well lead to thermal cracking unless proper curing techniques are followed, which agree with Sudan environment. Previous research has indicated that finer cement does not affect shrinkage of cement paste or concrete, however under the conditions mentioned above {{this may not be the}} case especially with respect to plastic shrinkage. 78 Segregation defined as separation of the constituent of a heterogeneous mixture so that their distribution is no longer uniform is which influenced by cement fineness.

40|$|International audienceThe {{interaction}} mechanism between polycarboxylate-type superplasticizer (PCP) {{and cement}} hydration {{is not fully}} understood and incompatibilities between concrete and additive are sometimes observed. In some cases, the fluidity tends to increase (“overfluidification”) few minutes after mixing. This is a problem because the overfluidification leds to <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> the <b>concrete</b> which could be critical on job site. Our study consisted first in highlighting the phenomenon of “over-fluidification” by slump flow tests on mortar. Next, the time evolution of the rheological behaviour of cement pastes {{in the presence of}} PCP was analysed thanks to a rheometry protocol in order to quantify the phenomenon. Later on, a parametric study was undertaken using this methodology. The operating conditions such as temperature and mixing process were studied as well as the effect of PCP structural parameters and the chemical characteristics of cement. In order to understand the origin of the phenomenon, adsorption measurements of PCP on cement particles were performed in the same conditions as those in the rheological measurements. Indeed, the phenomenon of “over-fluidification” could be related to the rate of the initial adsorption and the adsorption kinetics, both of which depend on the parameters of the process, the PCP structure and the cement reactivity...|$|R
40|$|Using {{sea sand}} and crushed stone is the {{distinctive}} feature <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> in Okinawa Prefecture. The characteristics <b>of</b> such <b>concrete</b> has already published in many papers by the auther and others. There {{are two kinds}} of crushed stone used in Okinawa Island. One is hard and called "Motobu" crushed stone and has large density and small specific water content. So the static and dynamic Young's maduli <b>of</b> the <b>concrete</b> which uses Motobu crushed stone are much larger than ones which described in the specifications of AIJ and JSCE in the practical range of compressive strength between 150 and 400 kg/cm². The other is relatively soft and called Ryukyu lime stone crushed stone. The concrete using the relatively soft crushed stone has smaller Young's moduli than the concrete with Motobu crushed stone, but still lightly larger than specified values in the AIJ specification. There are many factors which affect the values of the Young's maduli <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> In this study, compressive strength and unit weight <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> are the most affecting factors. Formulae for both static and dynamic Young's moduli are presented by using the method of the least square. The formulae are described in terms of compressive strength and unit weight <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> The increasing pattern of compressing strength <b>of</b> the <b>concrete</b> using hard crushed stone as the time passes is almost the same as described in common technical books. The rate of increase of Young's moduli as the time passes is much slower than ones of compressive strength. The concrete using larger maximum size crushed stone exhibits much larger Young's moduli than the concrete with small maximum size. <b>Bleeding</b> behavior <b>of</b> the <b>concrete</b> using crushed stone and sea sand will be much improved by using "Ishigū" as a part <b>of</b> fine aggregate. <b>Bleeding</b> rate or quantity becomes half or one-third, if "Ishigū" is used properly with other materials...|$|R

The method consists in inserting four electrode pairs at different depths <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> to monitor local change in ionic concentrations with time. Such variations can reflect migration <b>of</b> <b>bleed</b> water along <b>concrete</b> column during the plastic stage. The experimental set-up consisted of a rectangular column measuring 1005 mm in height and 250 × 250 mm in cross section. The variations in ionic concentrations were exploited to derive stability indices with regards to <b>bleeding</b> and homogeneity <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> Derived stability indices included bleeding coefficient, segregation coefficient, and homogeneity index. Various SCC mixtures made with a fixed water-to-cementitious materials ratio (w/cm) of 0. 42, different aggregate gradations, and slump-flow values of 650 ± 10 and 700 ± 10 mm were evaluated. Analysis of changes in ionic concentrations along column samples with time provided adequate evaluation of stability of SCC. For example, the increase in the concentration of viscosity-modifying admixture from 1 % to 2 % was shown to decrease the homogeneity index from 0. 36 to 0. 27, reflecting better stability. Validation procedure was carried out by correlating stability indices derived from electrical conductivity measurements to physical variations of coarse aggregate concentrations determined on plastic concrete sampled from the tested column elements at the end of electrical conductivity monitoring period. Good correlations between stability indices and aggregate concentrations are established...|$|R
40|$|Slag {{has been}} used in {{concrete}} as a cementitious extender for about 50 years in South Africa. Traditionally, blastfurnace slag {{has been used}} in concrete but recently a new product called Ground Granulated Corex Slag (GGCS) has become available on the market in the Western Cape Province. The objective of this research is to characterise the properties of this new product in concrete. In this study, the properties <b>of</b> corex slag <b>concrete</b> were compared to normal blastfurnace slag and plain CEM I <b>concretes.</b> A series <b>of</b> mixes was undertaken, with water:binder ratios varying between 0. 4 and 0. 3, and slag replacement levels between 30 and 70 %. The physical characterisation of corex slag revealed that the material is finer than blastfurnace slag, having more ultra-fine particles. The oxide analysis showed that the higher proportions of the calcium and magnesium oxides present in corex slag increase the potential for hydraulic activity of the binder compared with blastfurnace slag. The investigation <b>of</b> the fresh <b>concrete</b> properties revealed that the consistence <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> increases with the use of slag, especially at higher water:binder ratios. Blastfurnace slag performed marginally better than corex slag. The use of slag generally increased the setting time of the paste, with pastes containing corex slag having a shorter final setting time than those containing blastfurnace slag. The setting time was also found to increase with increasing stag replacement level. The increase in setting time caused the <b>bleed</b> time <b>of</b> slag <b>concrete</b> to increase but the total bleed volume was significantly reduced. The <b>bleed</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> were improved when corex slag was used. It was found that the compressive strength of the new cementitious material lagged behind that of CEM I controls during early ages but after seven days, corex slag concrete showed higher strength. The strength was observed to decrease with increasing water:binder ratio. From the compressive strength results, it was deduced that the optimum corex slag substitution rate varied with water:binder ratio, ranging from 45 to 60 % The elastic modulus <b>of</b> corex slag <b>concrete</b> was found to be equal to or higher than CEM I concrete, especially at low water:binder ratios (wtb = 0. 4). Deformation experiments showed that corex slag concrete had the lowest creep and shrinkage strains <b>of</b> all the <b>concretes</b> at low water:binder ratios. At higher water:binder ratios, however, the shrinkage strains were in the same range as the other two materials. Prediction models were also assessed and it was found that no model was able to accurately predict both creep and shrinkage. Generally, the shrinkage predictions were more accurate. Durability index tests showed that corex slag concrete has good to excellent potential durability, based on historical data. Marine exposure testing indicated that corex slag binds a substantial amount of chlorides, hence reducing the risk of corrosion in marine environments. Furthermore, the risk of carbonation-induced corrosion is also decreased. Expansion associated with alkali-silica reaction is minimised with the use of corex slag and the efficiency of the material increases with replacement level. It is concluded that corex slag is an excellent extender for use in concrete. Finally, recommendations are made on the need to further characterise the properties of the material...|$|R

But tendency that larger concentration caused less slump was observed.

The theoretical part describes processes, which take place in concrete at thermal loading and effect of this thermal load to mechanical and physical properties <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> Also there was described recommendation for testing physical and mechanical <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> at high temperatures according to RILEM TC. In experimental part mixes were made with greywacke aggregate, amphibolite aggregate and {{with the addition of}} polypropylene fibers or cellulose fibers. In these mixes was determined the effect of high temperatures on the density <b>of</b> <b>concrete,</b> compressive strength <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> and thermal strain <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> Further there was tested addition of 2 kg/m 3 polypropylene fibers to concrete with basalt aggregate and siliceous aggregate and influence of these fibers to density <b>of</b> <b>concrete,</b> compressive strength <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> and dynamic modulus of elasticity...|$|R

The results show that the effect of particles size and the volume of crumb rubber on the freeze-thaw resistance <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> are significant, apart from the air content <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> Excessively thick or excessively fine crumb rubber is not favorable for the freeze-thaw resistance <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> In addition, the excessive dosage of crumb rubber is also bad for the freeze-thaw resistance <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> Water swelling {{is one of the reasons}} for freezing and thawing failure <b>of</b> crumb rubber <b>concrete</b> in comparison to normal concrete...|$|R

In this research, {{a quick and}} accurate in-situ measuring method for mix proportion <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> is put forward. This method can succeed in measuring real mix proportion <b>of</b> any <b>concrete</b> paste precisely within 20 minutes according to four parameters <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> before initial setting time <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> By comparing the designed mix proportion <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> with the real measured one in construction site by this method, the quality <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> can be demonstrated. This method can evaluate the reliability of mix proportion for real concrete in construction site quickly and precisely, and ensure the quality <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> structures to avoid the occurrence of engineering accidents...|$|R
