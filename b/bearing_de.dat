40|$|We {{report the}} {{generation}} of a chimeric monoclonal antibody (ch 806) with specificity for an epitope on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) {{that is different from}} that targeted by all other anti-EGFR therapies. Ch 806 antibody is reactive to both de 2 - 7 and overexpressed wild-type (wt) EGFR but not native EGFR expressed in normal tissues at physiological levels. Ch 806 was stably expressed in CHO (DHFR −/−) cells and purified for subsequent characterisation and validated for use in preliminary immunotherapy investigations. Ch 806 retained the antigen binding specificity and affinity of the murine parental antibody. Furthermore, ch 806 displayed enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against target cells expressing the 806 antigen in the presence of human effector cells. Ch 806 was successfully radiolabelled with both iodine- 125 and indium- 111 without loss of antigen binding affinity or specificity. The radioimmunoconjugates were stable in the presence of human serum at 37 °C for up to 9 days and displayed a terminal half-life (T 1 / 2 β) of approximately 78 [*]h in nude mice. Biodistribution studies undertaken in BALB/c nude mice <b>bearing</b> <b>de</b> 2 - 7 EGFR-expressing or amplified EGFR-expressing xenografts revealed that 125 I-labelled ch 806 failed to display any significant tumour retention. However, specific and prolonged tumour localisation of' 111 In-labelled ch 806 was demonstrated with uptake of 31 %ID[*]g− 1 and a tumour to blood ratio of 5 [*]:[*] 1 observed at 7 days postinjection. In vivo therapy studies with ch 806 demonstrated significant antitumour effects on established de 2 - 7 EGFR xenografts in BALB/c nude mice compared to control, and both murine 806 and the anti-EGFR 528 antibodies. These results support a potential therapeutic role of ch 806 in the treatment of suitable EGFR-expressing tumours, and warrants further investigation of the potential of ch 806 as a therapeutic agent...|$|E

40|$|Total {{anomalous}} pulmonary {{venous return}} (TAPVR) is a congenital heart defect {{in which the}} pulmonary veins fail to enter the left atrium and drain instead into the right atrium or one of its venous tributaries. Although a genetic basis for TAPVR has long been recognized, no single gene involved in the pathogenesis of this disease has been identified to date. We previously reported a TAPVR patient <b>bearing</b> a <b>de</b> novo 10; 21 balanced translocation. In this work, we cloned both translocation breakpoints from this patient and mapped the ANKRD 1 gene, encoding a cardiac transcriptional regulator, 130 kb proximally to the breakpoint on chromosome 10. In situ hybridization analysis performed on murine embryos showed ANKRD 1 expression in the developing pulmonary veins, suggesting a possible role for this gene in TAPVR pathogenesis.

Finally, a nonconservative missense mutation in the ANKRD 1 gene was found in a third sporadic TAPVR patient. In vitro calpain-mediated degradation assays, coupled to reporter gene analysis in transfected HeLa cells, strongly suggested that this mutation enhances both the stability of the ANKRD 1 /CARP protein and its transcriptional repression activity upon the cardiac-specific atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) promoter.

Foram selecionados três Sítios, com fitofisionomias representativas: proximidades do Rio das Mortes (12 ° 37 'S; 50 ° 55 'W), foz do Rio das Mortes com o Araguaia (11 ° 54 'S; 50 ° 48 'W) e porção mediana do Rio Cristalino (12 ° 52 'S; 50 ° 49 'W). O método de amostragem adotado foi o de levantamentos rápidos. Foram identificadas oito fitofisionomias: Mata Inundável, Caapão, Babaçual, Cerradão, Cerrado stricto sensu, Campo de Murunduns, Campo de Byrsonima orbignyana e Campo Cerrado de Vochysia rufa. Foram levantadas 248 espécies de árvores, arbustos, sub-arbustos e lianas, distribuídas em 158 gêneros e 62 famílias.

This {{study was}} carried out in the Pantanal of the Mortes and Araguaia rivers, a flooded plain located in Cocalinho, northeastern Mato Grosso, Brazil. The {{objectives}} of this study were to conduct a preliminary survey of the flora and to characterize the vegetation types. Three representative sites were selected: one near Rio das Mortes (12 ° 37 'S; 50 ° 55 'W), one at the mouth of Araguaia and Mortes rivers (11 ° 54 'S; 50 ° 48 'W) and one in the middle portion of the Cristalino river (12 ° 52 'S; 50 ° 49 'W). Sampling was by the Rapid Survey method. Eight vegetation types were identified: Mata Inundável (swamp forest), Caapão (also swamp forest), Babaçual (Attalea speciosa forest), Cerradão, Cerrado stricto sensu (savanna types, closed canopy woodland and savanna grassland, respectively), Campo de Murunduns (grassland with scattered mounds <b>bearing</b> termites), Campo <b>de</b> Byrsonima orbignyana (grassland dominated by B. orbignyana) and Campo Cerrado de Vochysia rufa (grassland with scattered trees of V. rufa). A total of 248 species of trees, shrubs and lianas were recorded, distributed in 158 genera and 62 families. The vegetation types were heterogeneous; none of the species occurred at all sites, but Alibertia edulis (L. Rich.) A. Rich., Andira cuyabensis Benth., Maprounea guianensis (Aubl.) M.
