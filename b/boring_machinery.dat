25|$|The {{boreholes}} on Funafuti at {{the site}} now called Darwin's Drill, {{are the result of}} drilling conducted by the Royal Society of London for the purpose of investigating the formation of coral reefs and the question as to whether traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the coral of Pacific atolls. This investigation followed the work on the structure and distribution of coral reefs conducted by Charles Darwin in the Pacific. Drilling occurred in 1896, 1897 and 1911. In 1896 Professor Edgeworth David of the University of Sydney went to the Pacific atoll of Funafuti as part of the Funafuti Coral Reef Boring Expedition of the Royal Society, under Professor William Sollas. There were defects in the <b>boring</b> <b>machinery</b> and the bore penetrated only slightly more than 100 feet (approx. 31m).|$|E
60|$|So with {{a glimpse}} of these human tadpoles, in their deep close gallery, with their <b>boring</b> <b>machinery</b> ringing away, and {{artificial}} lights glaring and casting black shadows, the Professor's horoscope concludes. Humanity in dismal retreat before the cold, changed beyond recognition. Yet the Professor is reasonable enough, his facts are current science, his methods orderly. The contemplative man shivers at the prospect, starts up to poke the fire, and the whole of this remarkable book that is not written vanishes straightway in the smoke of his pipe. This is the great advantage of this unwritten literature: there is no bother in changing the books. The contemplative man consoles himself for the destiny of the species with the lost portion of Kubla Khan.|$|E
6000|$|The {{business}} {{began in}} January, 1916, with {{surveys of the}} rock in question. The work of surveying for excavations, never a very simple one, becomes much more difficult when the site is occupied by hostile persons with machine guns. In March, as the winter's snows abated, the <b>boring</b> <b>machinery</b> began to arrive, by mule {{as far as possible}} and then by hand. Altogether about half a kilometre of gallery had to be made to the mine chamber, and meanwhile the explosive was coming up load by load and resting first here, then there, in discreetly chosen positions. There were at the last thirty-five tons of it in the inner chamber. And while the boring machines bored and the work went on, Lieutenant Malvezzi was carefully working out the problem of [...] "il massimo effetto dirompimento" [...] and deciding exactly how to pack and explode his little hoard. On the eleventh of July, at 3.30, as he rejoices to state in his official report, [...] "the mine responded perfectly both in respect of the calculations made and of the practical effects," [...] that is to say, the Austrians were largely missing and the Italians were in possession of the crater of the Castelletto and looking down the Val Travenanzes from which they had been barred for so long. Within a month things had been so tidied up, and secured by further excavations and sandbags against hostile fire, that even a middle-aged English writer, extremely fagged and hot and breathless, could enjoy the same privilege. All this, you must understand, had gone on at a level to which the ordinary tourist rarely climbs, in a rarefied, chest-tightening atmosphere, with wisps of clouds floating in the clear air below and club-huts close at hand....|$|E
50|$|Charles Frederick Cheffins {{was born}} in London on 10 September 1807. His father had for many years acted as {{official}} manager to the New River Waterworks Company, in superintending the <b>boring</b> by <b>machinery</b> of the wooden pipes then in use for the supply of water to the metropolis. Having been so fortunate as to obtain a presentation to Christ's Hospital, young Cheffins was, in July 1815, admitted as a scholar into that institution, where he remained till the year 1822, prosecuting his studies with {{a fair amount of}} diligence, and obtaining several gold medals for his proficiency in arithmetic and mathematics.|$|R

30|$|First, higher {{trade costs}} raise {{the costs of}} {{imported}} capital goods and intermediate inputs. These costs are nontrivial, and they matter all the more in countries that are both very open and have comparative disadvantage in these products. Argentina {{is a classic example}} of such a country, and the understanding of this type of drag on economic performance dates back to the classic analysis of postwar underperformance by Díaz-Alejandro (1970), who noted that many key imported capital inputs (e.g., farm or industrial <b>machinery)</b> <b>bore</b> domestic prices that were very high indeed compared to world prices.|$|R
50|$|The Asquith was a {{short-lived}} English automobile manufactured by William Asquith at his Halifax machine tool works from 1901 to 1902. The car originally had a front-mounted De Dion engine and belt-drive; this last was later {{replaced by a}} two-speed gearbox because the belts kept slipping disastrously. Probably only {{one example of the}} car was built before the firm decided to concentrate on the production of <b>boring</b> <b>machinery.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1896 David {{went to the}} Pacific atoll of Funafuti {{as part of an}} {{expedition}} under Professor William Sollas of Oxford in order to take borings which it was hoped would settle the question of the formation of coral atolls. There were defects in the <b>boring</b> <b>machinery</b> and the bore penetrated only slightly more than 100 feet (approx. 31 m). In 1897 David led a second expedition (that included George Sweet as second-in-command, and Walter George Woolnough) which succeeded in reaching a depth of 557 feet (170 m) after which he had to return to Sydney. He then organised a third expedition in 1898 which, under the leadership of Dr. Alfred Edmund Finckh, was successful in carrying the bore to 1114 feet (340 m). The results provided support for Charles Darwin's theory of subsidence, and the expeditions made David's name as a geologist. Cara accompanied him on the second expedition and published a well-received account called Funafuti, or Three Months on a Coral Island.|$|E
5000|$|After {{entering}} Cape Fear, Raleigh turned south {{but soon}} ran hard aground on a bar known as [...] "the Rip." [...] As the tide went out, the now unsupported {{weight of the}} ironclads armored casemate, cannon, and <b>machinery</b> <b>bore</b> down heavily on the aft section of her keel. Unable to sustain the added weight pressure, Raleigh [...] "broke her back," [...] {{resulting in a total}} loss of the new ironclad after serving just one week in the Confederate Navy. Salvage crews reclaimed her iron plating, both her Brooke rifles, both smoothbore cannon, and shipped her boilers to CSS Chattahoochee, then being repaired at Columbus, GA.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{refers to}} the methods adopted for {{building}} a high-speed railway tunnel system between Bologna and Firenze (Italy), focusing attention on the Bologna node which represents {{the heart of the}} system, connecting the high speed network’s main lines. The project includes 9 tunnels, accounting for 73 km of the 78 km route crossing below the Apennines. The paper pays attention to the main aspects to be taken into consideration for correctly choosing the tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machinery</b> (TBM) to be used in urban areas. The fundamental point in analysing technical aspects regarding an earth pressure balance (EPB) machine concerned storing the main excavation parameter values; having collected and organised such data, statistical methods were used for processing it, the instantaneous velocities attained were empirically estimated and idle times were evaluated. The evaluation was made by calculating excavation specific energies (during different excavation phases) to find a satisfactory correlation with the type of ground crossed. Interesting results have been found by comparison with other excavation parameters; in particular, a better understanding of an earth pressure balance shield’s working phases has been reached thanks to an experimental study conducted during the construction of tunnels for a high-speed railway system in Italy. The paper contains details collected regarding the operation of two different EPB machines. RESUME...|$|E
