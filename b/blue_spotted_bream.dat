40|$|In {{light of}} the effects that arise from climate change this thesis will study the climate {{adaptation}} solutions used in large and densely populated municipalities in Denmark. In this study the climate plans in the municipalities of Copenhagen, Aarhus and Odense have been analysed. Moreover, a <b>Blue</b> <b>Spot</b> analysis is tested which is exemplified by a case study on a location {{in each of these}} three municipalities. The case study investigates the <b>Blue</b> <b>Spot</b> analysis potential for application, {{and at the same time}} it is examined to what extent the <b>Blue</b> <b>Spot</b> analysis is able to identify areas where climate change adaptation solutions can be implemented and launched. The study in the thesis concludes that SUDS (Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems) are the preferred climate change adaptation solutions in the investigated municipalities. It also concludes that the <b>Blue</b> <b>Spot</b> analysis is confined to identify critical areas with a potential flood risk, which is why the method can be inadequate in terms of identifying which climate adaptation solutions can be used. However, if supplied with supplemental investigations, the <b>Blue</b> <b>Spot</b> analysis is able to identify which SUDS are possible to implement...|$|R

50|$|Felimare marci has a {{body colour}} of pale yellow-green covered by bright <b>blue</b> <b>spots</b> of various shapes and sizes. In {{the centre of}} the back the spots are round and form a regular pattern of {{numerous}} dark spots interspersed with larger bright <b>blue</b> <b>spots.</b> Towards the edge of the mantle the ground colour changes to red-brown and the <b>blue</b> <b>spots</b> become irregular, broken, blue rings. There is a contorted triple edge to the mantle with a pale yellow extreme margin to the upper and lower rims and a pale orange submarginal line on the middle rim. The rhinophores have a pale blue base and a white club grading to blue at the tip. The gills are translucent white with a blue line on the inner and outer faces. Two orange lines run parallel with the blue line from the base to midway up the gill on the outer face. The edge of the foot has a different pattern, of alternating blue and white patches with dark <b>blue</b> <b>spots.</b>|$|R
40|$|Tissue {{derived from}} {{embryonic}} suspension cultures of cassava was bombarded with microparticles {{coated with a}} plasmid containing the uidA gene, which codes for beta-glucuronidase (GUS). After 3 days, the effect of different bombardment parameters was evaluated by comparing the numbers of <b>blue</b> <b>spots</b> that resulted from histological GUS assays. Counting of <b>blue</b> <b>spots</b> was performed using a system comprised of {{a black and white}} video camera, a stereoscope and a personal computer. A reproducible counting method was established by optimizing GUS assay conditions, preparation of tissue samples and acquisition of video images in view of attaining the highest possible contrast between the <b>blue</b> <b>spots</b> and the surrounding tissue. The effects of bombardment pressure, microparticle size, number of bombardments, and osmotic pretreatment on GUS expression were investigated. Optimal transient expression of the uidA gene was observed after bombardment at 1100 psi, with a particle size of 1 micrometer, an osmotic pretreatment and two bombardments per sample. The highest number of <b>blue</b> <b>spots</b> observed was 2400 per square centimeter of bombarded tissue. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
