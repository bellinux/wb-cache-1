In an interview conducted for Playboy in 1965, he said that granting <b>black</b> <b>Americans</b> only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between them and whites. King said that he did not seek a full restitution of wages lost to slavery, which he believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50billion over ten years to all disadvantaged groups.|$|E

All of these dance styles are different stylistically. They share common ground in their street origins and in their improvisational nature.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{the author}} {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the socialization experience of an individual <b>Black</b> <b>American</b> man. He deconstructs critical childhood experiences that reinforced patriarchal norms, followed by experiences with family and in places of scholarship where he began to grapple with his role as an oppressor. Sexism in general is addressed, and the author expresses a need for men to acknowledge and confront their internalized and externalized sexism. This issue becomes particularly complex with <b>Black</b> <b>American</b> men who may feel systemically powerless. To eradicate sexism in the <b>Black</b> <b>American</b> community, <b>Black</b> <b>American</b> men must redefine their ideas about male identity. The author concludes by recommending that <b>Black</b> <b>American</b> men and all men of color discuss the impact of racism in their lives while still accepting responsibility for their sexist attitudes, behavior, and socialization...|$|R

5|$|Wentworth Arthur Matthew {{founded the}} Commandment Keepers Congregation in Harlem in 1919.

Garvey used the Biblical Jews in exile as a metaphor for black people in North America. One of the accomplishments of Garvey's movement was to strengthen the connection between <b>black</b> <b>Americans</b> and Africa, Ethiopia in particular.

5|$|Cleveland, like {{a growing}} number of Northerners (and nearly all white Southerners) saw Reconstruction as a failed experiment, and was {{reluctant}} to use federal power to enforce the 15th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guaranteed voting rights to African Americans. Though Cleveland appointed no <b>black</b> <b>Americans</b> to patronage jobs, he allowed Frederick Douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C. and appointed another black man (James Campbell Matthews, a former New York judge) to replace Douglass upon his resignation. His decision to replace Douglass with a black man was met with outrage, but Cleveland claimed to have known Matthews personally.|$|E
5|$|In early 1859, {{abolitionist}} Republican U.S. Senator William H. Seward sold Tubman a {{small piece}} of land on the outskirts of Auburn, New York, for US$1,200. The city was a hotbed of antislavery activism, and Tubman seized the opportunity to deliver her parents from the harsh Canadian winters. Returning to the U.S. meant that escaped slaves were at risk of being returned to the south under the Fugitive Slave Law, and Tubman's siblings expressed reservations. Catherine Clinton suggests that anger over the 1857 Dred Scott decision may have prompted Tubman to return to the U.S. Her land in Auburn became a haven for Tubman's family and friends. For years, she took in relatives and boarders, offering a safe place for <b>black</b> <b>Americans</b> seeking a better life in the north.|$|E

5|$|Slavery by Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of <b>Black</b> <b>Americans</b> {{from the}} Civil War to World War II {{is a book}} by American writer Douglas A. Blackmon, {{published}} by Anchor Books in 2008. It explores the forced labor of imprisoned black men and women, through the convict lease system used by states, local governments, white farmers, and corporations after the American Civil War until World War II in the southern United States. Blackmon argues that slavery in the United States did not end with the Civil War, but instead persisted well into the 20th century. It depicts the subjugation of Convict Leasing, Sharecropping and Peonage and tells {{the fate of the}} former but not of the latter two.|$|E

By the 1980s, such discrimination was a thing of the past, and today most U.S. Grand Lodges recognise their Prince Hall counterparts, and the authorities of both traditions are working towards full recognition. The United Grand Lodge of England has no problem with recognising Prince Hall Grand Lodges. While celebrating their heritage as lodges of <b>black</b> <b>Americans,</b> Prince Hall is open to all men regardless of race or religion.|$|E

5|$|Racial {{violence}} {{at the time}} was common throughout the nation, manifested as individual incidents of extra-legal actions, or attacks on entire communities. Lynchings reached a peak around the start of the 20th century as southern states were disenfranchising black voters and imposing white supremacy; white supremacists used it as a means of social control throughout the South. In 1866 Florida, as did many Southern states, passed laws called Black Codes disenfranchising black citizens. Although these were quickly overturned, and black citizens enjoyed a brief period of improved social standing, by the late 19th century black political influence was virtually nil. The white Democrat-dominated legislature passed a poll tax in 1885, which largely served to disenfranchise all poor voters. Losing political power, black voters suffered a deterioration of their legal and political rights in the years following. Without the right to vote, they were excluded as jurors and could not run for office, effectively excluding them from the political process. The United States as a whole was experiencing rapid social changes: an influx of European immigrants, industrialization and the growth of cities, and political experimentation in the North. In the South, <b>black</b> <b>Americans</b> grew increasingly dissatisfied with their lack of economic opportunity and status as second-class citizens.|$|E
