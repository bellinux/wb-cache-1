5|$|According to The Pride of the Yankees, the 1942 {{film about}} Gehrig's life, Pipp asked {{out of the}} game because he was {{experiencing}} double vision from <b>being</b> <b>hit</b> in the head two days prior. By 1953, Pipp reported to The New York Times that he was taken out of the lineup due to <b>being</b> <b>hit</b> in the head by a pitch thrown by Charlie Caldwell during batting practice.

5|$|Adventure 2 has {{the health}} system found in many other Sonic games. The player {{collects}} rings scattered throughout the levels; <b>being</b> <b>hit</b> by an enemy while holding rings causes the player to drop them all, while <b>being</b> <b>hit</b> without rings causes them to lose a life. Tails and Eggman have the customary health bar, which is slowly refilled by collecting rings. Dying with no lives results in a game over screen. The characters can obtain permanent upgrades that grant them new abilities; for example, one allows Sonic and Shadow to dash along a sequential trail of rings to reach distant platforms, while another lets Knuckles and Rouge attack powerfully enough to break certain containers. Chaos Drives {{can be used with}} the player's Chao (small, anthropomorphic animals).|$|E
5|$|Similarly to Sonic Advance 1 and 2 before it, Advance 3 is a fast-paced 2D platformer. The player {{controls}} {{one of five}} characters {{simultaneously with}} a second one as a sidekick; alternately, a second player joins and one controls each character. The two characters run and jump {{through a series of}} seven levels, destroying robots along the way. The player collects rings in levels and boss battles as a form of health: upon <b>being</b> <b>hit</b> by an enemy or harmful obstacle, the player's rings will scatter and can be recollected. <b>Being</b> <b>hit</b> while carrying no rings, being crushed by an obstacle, or falling into a bottomless pit causes death; running out of lives incurs a game over screen.|$|E
