40|$|Millimeter wave {{communications}} rely on narrow-beam transmissions to {{cope with}} the strong signal attenuation at these frequencies, thus demanding precise <b>beam</b> <b>alignment</b> between transmitter and receiver. The communication overhead incurred to achieve <b>beam</b> <b>alignment</b> may become a severe impairment in mobile networks. This paper addresses the problem of optimizing <b>beam</b> <b>alignment</b> acquisition, with the goal of maximizing throughput.

It is considered as a key technology for the fifth generation wireless networks and is already used in wireless LAN (e. g., IEEE 802. 11 ad). Using mmWave for vehicular communications, however, is often viewed with some skepticism due to a misconception that the Doppler spread would become too large at these high frequencies. This is not true when directional beam is employed for communications. In this paper, closed form expressions relating the channel coherence time and beamwidth are derived. Unlike prior work that assumed perfect beam pointing, the pointing error due to the receiver motion is incorporated {{to show that there}} exists a non-zero optimal beamwidth that maximizes the coherence time. To investigate the mobility effect on the <b>beam</b> <b>alignment</b> which is an important feature in mmWave systems, a novel concept of beam coherence time is defined. The beam coherence time, which is an effective measure of <b>beam</b> <b>alignment</b> frequency, is shown to be much larger than the conventional channel coherence time and thus results in reduced <b>beam</b> <b>alignment</b> overhead. Using the derived correlation function, the channel coherence time, and the beam coherence time, an overall performance metric considering both the channel time-variation and the <b>beam</b> <b>alignment</b> overhead is derived. Using this metric, it is shown that <b>beam</b> <b>alignment</b> in every beam coherence time performs better than the <b>beam</b> <b>alignment</b> in every channel coherence time due to the large overhead for the latter case...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} <b>beam</b> <b>alignment</b> in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems, and design an optimal algorithm to reduce the overhead. Specifically, due to directional communications, the transmitter and receiver beams need to be aligned, which incurs high delay overhead since without a priori knowledge of the transmitter/receiver location, the search space spans the entire angular domain. This is further exacerbated under dynamic conditions (e. g., moving vehicles) where the access to the base station (access point) is highly dynamic with intermittent on-off periods, requiring more frequent <b>beam</b> <b>alignment</b> and signal training. To mitigate this issue, we consider an online stochastic optimization formulation where {{the goal is to}} maximize the directivity gain (i. e., received energy) of the <b>beam</b> <b>alignment</b> policy within a time period. We exploit the inherent correlation and unimodality properties of the model, and demonstrate that contextual information improves the performance. To this end, we propose an equivalent structured Multi-Armed Bandit model to optimally exploit the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. In contrast to the classical MAB models, the contextual information makes the lower bound on regret (i. e., performance loss compared with an oracle policy) independent of the number of beams. This is a crucial property since the number of all combinations of beam patterns can be large in transceiver antenna arrays, especially in massive MIMO systems. We further provide an asymptotically optimal <b>beam</b> <b>alignment</b> algorithm, and investigate its performance via simulations.

40|$|In {{conventional}} <b>beam</b> based <b>alignment</b> (BBA) procedures, {{the relative}} alignment of a quadrupole {{to a nearby}} beam position monitor is determined by finding a beam position in the quadrupole at which the closed orbit does not change when the quadrupole field is varied. The final focus magnets of the interaction regions (IR) of circular colliders often have some specialized properties that {{make it difficult to}} perform conventional <b>beam</b> based <b>alignment</b> procedures. At the HERA interaction points, for example, these properties are: (a) The quadrupoles are quite strong and long. Therefore a thin lens approximation is quite imprecise. (b) The effects of angular magnet offsets become significant. (c) The possibilities to steer the beam are limited as long as the alignment is not within specifications. (d) The beam orbit has design offsets and design angles with respect to the axis of the low-beta quadrupoles. (e) Often quadrupoles do not have a beam position monitor in their vicinity. Here we present a <b>beam</b> based <b>alignment</b> procedure that determines the relative offset of the closed orbit from a quadrupole center without requiring large orbit changes or monitors next to the quadrupole. Taking into account the alignment angle allows us to reduce the sensitivity to optical errors by one to two orders of magnitude.

40|$|Efficient <b>beam</b> <b>alignment</b> is {{a crucial}} {{component}} in millimeter wave systems with analog beamforming, especially in fast-changing vehicular settings. This paper proposes a position-aided approach where the vehicle's position (e. g., available via GPS) is used to query the multipath fingerprint database, which provides prior knowledge of potential pointing directions for reliable <b>beam</b> <b>alignment.</b> The approach is the inverse of fingerprinting localization, where the measured multipath signature is compared to the fingerprint database to retrieve the most likely position. The power loss probability is introduced as a metric to quantify misalignment accuracy and is used for optimizing candidate beam selection. Two candidate beam selection methods are developed, where one is a heuristic while the other minimizes the misalignment probability. The proposed <b>beam</b> <b>alignment</b> is evaluated using realistic channels generated from a commercial ray-tracing simulator.
