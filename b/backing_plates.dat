25|$|Another ambitious {{restoration}} effort {{began in}} 2004, when Conservancy staff and contractors {{worked together to}} refurbish the 15,876 Minton tiles that hang on {{the ceiling of the}} Bethesda Arcade. Originally designed by Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mould, the ceiling of the Arcade is lined by 15,876 elaborately patterned encaustic tiles. Made by Minton and Company, a leading 19th-century ceramic manufacturer in England, the ceiling tiles are divided into 49 panels, each containing 324 tiles. Salt and water infiltration from the roadway above had badly damaged the tiles, leaving their <b>backing</b> <b>plates</b> so corroded they had to be removed in the 1980s. The tiles sat in storage for more than 20 years until the Conservancy received a generous private donation for their restoration. The Conservancy embarked on a $7 million restoration effort to return the Minton tiles to their original luster in 2004. A team of seven conservation technicians cleaned and repaired more than 14,000 original tiles by hand. Only three panels of replica tiles were needed to replace those that had been damaged beyond repair. For those recreations, the Conservancy decided to commission Maw and Company, Minton's successor in Stoke-on-Trent, England. The completed Bethesda Terrace Arcade was unveiled to much fanfare in March 2007. In 2006, the Conservancy completed a nine-month renovation of the Mall in a project that returned the landscape to its original character and ensured the protection of its great American Elms.|$|E

40|$|B. Schlegel, K. Wiebusch, 2 ̆ 6 S. Otto, PhD, Gustavus Adolphus College, St. Peter, MN In {{recent years}} {{starting}} block platforms in swimming have been modified {{to include an}} adjustable <b>back</b> <b>plate,</b> which has drawn the attention of some researchers. Beretić, Đurović, and Okičić (2012) reported that the kick-start {{with the use of}} the <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> resulted in a significantly faster ten-meter swim time (p= 0. 04) compared to a traditional track start without a <b>back</b> <b>plate.</b> The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of adding a <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> to the platform of a starting block in swimming on reaction and 12. 5 -yard swim time. This study included male and female athletes from a Division III swim team. A one-sample design was used. Subjects were allowed time to familiarize themselves with both styles of starting block. They then performed three starts followed by a 12. 5 -yard freestyle swim using the <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> style and three using the traditional platform style in a randomized sequence. The average of each block style was calculated and used for analysis. The independent variable was the starting block style. The dependent variables were reaction time and 12. 5 -yard swim time. Two paired sample t-tests were used to compare the difference in reaction and 12. 5 -yard swim time between the two starts. Significance was determined at the p ≤. 025 level controlling for Familywise error rate due to the multiple t-tests needed. Results revealed that there was not a significant difference in reaction time between starting block style at the p≤ 0. 025, t (24) = 1. 955, p = 0. 063. The results indicated a statistically significant difference in 12. 5 -yard time at the p ≤. 025 for the start with the <b>back</b> <b>plate,</b> t (24) = 9. 98, p = 0. 000. The mean score for the <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> reaction time (0. 429 ± 0. 109) was not significantly less than the mean score for the traditional starting block reaction time (0. 464 ± 0. 099). The mean score for the 12. 5 -yard swim time from the <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> (4. 823 ±. 388) was significantly less than the mean 12. 5 -yard swim time from the traditional starting block (4. 972 ±. 399). In conclusion, this study may suggest that a <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> could be utilized to improve reaction time and 12. 5 -yard swim time for collegiate swimmers. Future research might look at force generated from different starting style. IRB# 1314 - 0265. NACSM Professional Sponsor: Stephanie Ott...|$|R

40|$|Cooling in a {{centrifugal}} compressor {{can improve the}} performance and reduce the impeller temperature. In a {{centrifugal compressor}}, external walls can be cool down, which {{is known as the}} shell cooling. This method avoids undesirable effects induced by other cooling methods. Cooling can be applied on different external walls, such as the shroud, diffuser or the <b>back</b> <b>plate.</b> This paper focuses on seeking the most effective cooling place to increase the performance and reduce the impeller temperature. It is found that shroud cooling improves the compressor performance the most. Shroud cooling with 2400 W of cooling power increases the pressure ratio by 4. 6 % and efficiency by 1. 49 %. Each 500 W increase in the shroud cooling power, increases the efficiency by 0. 3 %. Diffuser cooling and <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> cooling have an identical effect on the polytropic efficiency. However, <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> cooling increases the pressure ratio more than diffuser cooling.
