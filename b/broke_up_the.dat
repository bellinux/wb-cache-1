5|$|Although Spiderland was {{not widely}} {{recognized}} on its initial release, it eventually {{sold more than}} 50,000 copies and became a landmark album in underground music after Slint <b>broke</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> album has been influential on the styles of many bands in the post-rock and math rock genres. In 2005, 2007 and 2013–2014, Slint reunited for a tour consisting of performances of Spiderland in its entirety.|$|E
5|$|Cook was a {{consistent}} scorer {{the following two}} seasons as he recorded 33 points in 1933–34 and 34 points in 1934–35. However, he missed much of the 1935–36 season due to an arthritic condition. Believing he would not recover, the Rangers sold Cook to the Boston Bruins. The transaction <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Bread Line, which had been together for nine seasons. He appeared in 40 games for the Bruins in 1936–37, his final NHL season, and recorded nine points.|$|E
5|$|A rarely {{enforced}} 1958 law— {{known as}} Decree Number 10— was invoked in May 1963 to prohibit {{the display of}} religious flags. This disallowed the flying of the Buddhist flag on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. The application of the law caused indignation among Buddhists {{on the eve of}} the most important religious festival of the year, as a week earlier Catholics had been encouraged to display Vatican flags at a government-sponsored celebration for Diem's brother, Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục, the most senior Catholic cleric in the country. On 8 May in Huế, a crowd of Buddhists protested against the ban on the Buddhist flag. The police and army <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> demonstration by firing guns at and throwing grenades into the gathering, leaving nine people dead.|$|E

5|$|After a down year in 1955 for the 49ers and for McElhenny, he had {{his most}} {{productive}} rushing season statistically in 1956, picking up 916 yards and eight touchdowns. He was invited to his third Pro Bowl. John Henry Johnson was traded prior to the 1957 season, which <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Million Dollar Backfield. Led by McElhenny and Tittle, the 49ers finished the 1957 regular season tied for the Western Conference title with the Detroit Lions. In the Western Conference tiebreaker, McElhenny carried 14 times for 82 yards and caught six passes for 96 yards and a touchdown, but the Lions won with a comeback victory {{to advance to the}} 1957 NFL Championship Game. Following the season, McElhenny was invited to the 1958 Pro Bowl and was named the player of the game.|$|E
5|$|Cloud cover {{over the}} target and bad radio {{communication}} meant the B-24 formation <b>broke</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> smaller B-24 formation lost their way and crossed into the Netherlands near Woensdrecht. After wandering over North Netherlands they turned north towards the North Sea where they ditched their bombs. II. and IV./JG 1 took off from Woensdrecht and München-Gladbach to intercept while 5. and 6./JG 1 refuelled at Schiphol. 4./JG 1 made one pass at the bombers and two Liberators were claimed but not confirmed. 12./JG 1 intercepted over Terschelling, downing two Liberators. Of these, one {{was the result of}} a collision with a downed Fw-190 that cut the bomber's tail, 12./JG 1's only loss.|$|E
5|$|Humber nearly {{achieved}} a no hitter for the 2011 Chicago White Sox twice. On April 25, 2011, {{in the sixth}} start of his career, he took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium but, with one out, Alex Rodriguez singled up the middle, leaving Humber to finish with seven scoreless innings. Later that year he took a no-hitter into the sixth inning against the Washington Nationals on June 26, but ended up earning a 2–1 loss when he surrendered a seventh inning home run to Danny Espinosa. In that contest, Jerry Hairston, Jr. <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> no-hitter leading off the sixth after Roger Bernadina earned a hit by pitch {{to break up the}} perfect game in the fourth.|$|E

5|$|In late 1969, Zappa <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> band. He {{often cited}} the {{financial}} strain {{as the main}} reason, but also commented on the band members' lack of sufficient effort. Many band members were bitter about Zappa's decision, and some {{took it as a}} sign of Zappa's concern for perfection at the expense of human feeling. Others were irritated by 'his autocratic ways', exemplified by Zappa's never staying at the same hotel as the band members. Several members played for Zappa in years to come. Remaining recordings with the band from this period were collected on Weasels Ripped My Flesh and Burnt Weeny Sandwich (both released in 1970).|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{confirms that}} the Coleoptera are monophyletic. Duane McKenna et al. (2015) used eight nuclear genes for 367 species from 172 of 183 Coleopteran families. They split the Adephaga into 2 clades, Hydradephaga and Geadephaga, <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Cucujoidea into 3 clades, and placed the Lymexyloidea within the Tenebrionoidea. The Polyphaga appear to date from the Triassic. Most extant beetle families appear to have arisen in the Cretaceous. The cladogram is based on McKenna (2015). The number of species in each group (mainly superfamilies) is shown in parentheses, and boldface if over 10,000. English names are given where possible. Dates of origin of major groups are shown in italics in {{millions of years ago}} (mya).|$|E

5|$|The largely outnumbered {{defenders}} of Medina, mainly Muslims led by Islamic prophet Muhammad, dug a trench on {{the suggestion of}} Salman Farsi, which together with Medina's natural fortifications, rendered the confederate cavalry (consisting of horses and camels) useless, locking the two sides in a stalemate. Hoping to make several attacks at once, the confederates persuaded the Muslim-allied Medinan Jews, Banu Qurayza, to attack the city from the south. However, Muhammad's diplomacy derailed the negotiations, and <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> confederacy against him. The well-organised defenders, the sinking of confederate morale, and poor weather conditions caused the siege to end in a fiasco.|$|E
5|$|The next day, August 24, the 23rd Infantry {{continued}} {{clearing the}} rear areas and by night it {{estimated that there}} were fewer than 200 North Koreans behind the forward positions. The Bowling Alley front was quiet during the day. Shortly after midnight on August 24 the North Koreans launched what had by now become their regular nightly attack down the Bowling Alley. This attack was in an estimated two-company strength supported by a few tanks. The 27th Infantry <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> attack and two more North Korean tanks were destroyed by the supporting artillery fire. This was the last night the 27th Infantry Regiment spent in the Bowling Alley.|$|E
5|$|After 15:00 an airstrike {{was called}} in to {{dislodge}} the surviving Chinese in front of D Company. However, the attack by two US Marine Corps F4U Corsairs was mistakenly directed at the Australians themselves after their positions were wrongly marked by the spotter plane. Two men were killed and several badly burnt by napalm before the attack was broken off after the company second-in-command—Captain Michael Ryan—ran out under Chinese fire waving a marker panel. The company medical orderly—Private Ronald Dunque—was subsequently awarded the Military Medal for his efforts assisting the wounded despite his own injuries. The Chinese quickly attempted to exploit the chaos, moving against D Company's long exposed eastern flank. 11 Platoon on the main ridge forward of the summit was subjected to a frontal assault; however, unaffected by the napalm, they <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Chinese attack and inflicted heavy casualties on them. Regardless, further Chinese attempts to infiltrate the Australian positions continued into the afternoon.|$|E

5|$|Augustus Owsley Stanley I (May 21, 1867 – August 12, 1958) was an American {{politician}} {{from the}} US state of Kentucky. A Democrat, {{he served as}} the 38th Governor of Kentucky and also represented the state in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. From 1903 to 1915, Stanley represented Kentucky's 2nd congressional district in the House of Representatives, where he gained {{a reputation as a}} progressive reformer. Beginning in 1904, he called for an antitrust investigation of the American Tobacco Company, claiming they were a monopsony that drove down prices for the tobacco farmers of his district. As a result of his investigation, the Supreme Court of the United States <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> American Tobacco Company in 1911. Stanley also chaired a committee that conducted an antitrust investigation of U.S. Steel, which brought him national acclaim. Many of his ideas were incorporated into the Clayton Antitrust Act.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Chanchu {{attained}} peak winds, an eastward-moving trough over China <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ridge {{to the north}}, causing the typhoon to turn sharply to the north into a less favorable environment. With decreased outflow and stronger wind shear, Chanchu began slowly weakening. The eye initially remained small, but the outer eyewall deteriorated on May16 as the convection decreased in the northern periphery. The trough that previously weakened the ridge steered Chanchu to the north-northeast and forced an extratropical transition. Late on May17, the JMA downgraded the typhoon to a severe tropical storm. Around that time, Chanchu made landfall near Shantou, Guangdong in southeastern China, about 315km (195mi) east of Hong Kong; the JTWC estimated landfall winds of 130km/h (85mph), while the JMA estimated them at 110km/h (70km/h). Early on May18, the JTWC discontinued advisories, although the JMA continued tracking Chanchu over southeastern China through eastern Fujian province. Later on May18, the storm emerged into the East China Sea, becoming fully extratropical at 00:00UTC on May19. The remnants continued toward Japan before dissipating at 18:00UTC that day off {{the west coast of}} Kyushu in southern Japan.|$|E
5|$|Chambers and {{his second}} in command, Captain Charles Spragg, {{immediately}} set about constructing a defensive trench across the post, and strengthening its other defences. But by now the Turks, from the 72nd Infantry Regiment, about 1,000-strong, had managed to use the terrain and darkness to close in on the position. At 22:00 Chambers reported that the position was under attack and surrounded, and at 23:35 the telephone line to headquarters was cut by the Turks. The area in front of No.3 Post was in a gully {{and out of sight}} to the defenders, so they had to climb on the trench parapet to engage the Turks. This tactic worked well, and they <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Turkish assault, causing the attackers some casualties. The Turks did not withdraw far, and crept up {{to the edge of the}} New Zealanders' trench during the night. They then threw hand grenades into the New Zealanders' position. At the same time, small arms fire from the surrounding Turkish positions pinned the New Zealanders down.|$|E

5|$|In 1798, Napoleon ordered this bucentaur to be destroyed, {{less for}} the sake of its golden decorations than as a {{political}} gesture to symbolize his victory in conquering the city. French soldiers <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> carved wooden portions and the gold decorations of the ship into small pieces, carted them to the island of San Giorgio Maggiore and set fire to them to recover the gold. The ship burned for three days, and French soldiers used 400 mules to carry away its gold. The decorative elements of the vessel that survived the flames are preserved in the Museo Civico Correr in Venice, and there is a detailed scale model of the vessel in the Arsenale. The hull survived and, renamed the Prama Hydra and armed with four cannons, was stationed {{at the mouth of the}} Lido's port where it served as a coastal battery. Subsequently, the ship was returned to the Arsenale and used as a prison ship until it was entirely destroyed in 1824.|$|E
5|$|In 1806, German {{botanist}} Carl Ludwig Willdenow gave it {{the botanical}} name Ficus australis in Species Plantarum, {{but this is a}} nomen illegitimum as the species already had a validly published name. Italian botanist Guglielmo Gasparrini <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> genus Ficus in 1844, placing the species in the genus Urostigma as U.rubiginosum. In 1862, Dutch botanist Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel described Urostigma leichhardtii from material collected from Cape Cleveland, Queensland, noting it had affinities to F. rubiginosa. In 1867, he placed Urostigma as a subgenus in the reunited Ficus, which resulted in the taxon becoming Ficus leichhardtii. Miquel also described Ficus leichhardtii variety angustata from Whitsunday Island, later classified as F. shirleyana by Czech botanist Karel Domin. Queensland state botanist Frederick Manson Bailey described Ficus macrophylla variety pubescens in 1911 from Queensland, Domin later renaming it Ficus baileyana. All these taxa were found to be indistinguishable from (and hence reclassified as) F.rubiginosa by Dixon in 2001.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not long}} before the PVA 173rd Regiment {{attacked}} the western and the southern perimeter, while the 172nd Regiment struck the hills on the northern perimeter. Despite the preparations, the understrength garrison was overwhelmed, with the Chinese opening several gaps in the defenses and reaching the rear areas. The resulting chaos, however, caused a breakdown in discipline among the Chinese soldiers, who began looting food and clothing instead of exploiting the situation. The defending Americans managed to destroy the Chinese forces in counterattacks, while a breakdown of communications between the Chinese regiments allowed the gaps to close. When the fighting stopped, the Chinese had only gained the East Hill on the northern perimeter. Another attack was planned for the night of 29 November, but air raids by VMF-542 <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Chinese formations before it could be carried out.|$|E
