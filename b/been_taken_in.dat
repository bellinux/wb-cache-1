5|$|After his {{interview}} with the police, Farrar immediately filed for divorce from Green and for custody of Kate, who had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> by his parents while Green and Farrar dealt with the police. A court later awarded temporary custody of Kate to Farrar's parents, due to Green's instability and Kate's professed anger with her father. Green was allowed supervised access during this period, while Farrar's visits {{were not required to}} be supervised.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin can induce {{swelling}} of skin tissues in some people. In one study, angioedema appeared one {{to six hours}} after ingesting aspirin {{in some of the}} people. However, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these people; the aspirin had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> combination with another NSAID-induced drug when angioedema appeared.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} census {{on record}} <b>in</b> Burmese history <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> 1359 in the Pinya Kingdom. The first nationwide census <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> 1638, {{and it was}} followed by two other nationwide censuses in 1784 and 1803. The first modern census <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> 1891 in the British colonial period. It was carried out in 10-year intervals until 1941. In the post-independence area, the census has been conducted 3 times, in 1973, 1983, and 2014.|$|R
5|$|Gram {{quantities}} of various copper salts have <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> suicide attempts and produced acute copper toxicity in humans, possibly due to redox cycling and {{the generation of}} reactive oxygen species that damage DNA. Corresponding amounts of copper salts (30mg/kg) are toxic in animals. A minimum dietary value for healthy growth in rabbits {{has been reported to}} be at least 3 ppm in the diet. However, higher concentrations of copper (100 ppm, 200 ppm, or 500 ppm) in the diet of rabbits may favorably influence feed conversion efficiency, growth rates, and carcass dressing percentages.|$|E
5|$|No {{player has}} taken {{multiple}} hat-tricks in international women's cricket, and similarly no venue has hosted {{more than one}} hat-trick. English, Pakistani and New Zealand bowlers have taken more hat-tricks than any other nations; three bowlers from each nation have achieved the feat. Nine hat-tricks have <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> ODIs, while all six of the hat-tricks in T20I matches have happened since the most recent instance in women's Tests.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the occupation, {{the most}} recent Yugoslav census had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> 1931. This census used {{language}} as the primary criterion, and counted all speakers of Serbo-Croatian as one group, rather than recognising distinct Serb, Croat, Bosnian Muslim, Macedonian and Montenegrin nationalities. Aligning data on religious affiliation with the linguistic data {{has been used by}} scholars to determine approximate numbers of Serbs and Croats in the 1931 census, by counting those of the Roman Catholic denomination as Croats.|$|E

5|$|The Greek {{victories}} {{had been}} short-lived. The Sultan {{had called to}} his aid his Egyptian vassal Muhammad Ali, who had dispatched his son Ibrahim Pasha to Greece with a fleet and 8,000 men, later adding a further 25,000 troops. Ibrahim’s intervention proved decisive: the Peloponnese had been reconquered in 1825; the gateway town of Messolonghi had fallen in 1826; Athens had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> 1827. All that Greek nationalists still held was Nafplion, Hydra, Mani and Aegina.|$|E
5|$|Two further hat-tricks have <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> women's Tests; by Pakistan's Shaiza Khan in 2004, and Australia's Rene Farrell in 2011. Farrell's hat-trick {{is one of}} five in women's {{international}} cricket {{that did}} not involve a fielder, as two of the batsmen were dismissed leg before wicket (lbw), and one was bowled. Sana Mir's WT20I hat-trick in 2015 similarly contained two lbws and one bowled, while Julie Harris' women's One Day International (WODI) hat-trick during the 1993 Women's Cricket World Cup and Rumana Ahmed (WODI) hat-trick in 2016 ware both made up of three consecutive lbws and Dane van Niekerk (WODI) hat-trick in 2013 had two bowled and one lbw. The first hat-trick in women's One Day Internationals was made just six days prior to Harris', by Carole Hodges, during the same competition. Those remain the only hat-tricks to have <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> women's World Cups, though Ekta Bisht took a hat-trick for India during the 2012 Women's World Twenty20, the equivalent competition for women's Twenty20 International cricket.|$|E
5|$|Cuthbert {{presided over}} the Council of Clovesho in 747 along with Æthelbald of Mercia. This {{gathering}} mandated that all clergy should explain the basic tenets of Christianity to the laity, as well as legislating on clerical dress, control of monasteries, and {{the behavior of the}} clergy. It also mandated that each diocese hold a synod to proclaim the decisions of the council. Cuthbert sent his deacon Cynebert to Pope Gregory III after the council with a report on the council and its resolutions. This action may have <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> response to Boniface's complaints about Cuthbert and Æthelbald to the papacy. The actions of the council were also gathered into a collection at Cuthbert's command.|$|E

According to the 1983 census, the population of the country was 35,442,972 as of 31 March 1983, and the Bamar accounted for 69 percent of the population. The Burmese government estimates the population at 60.98 million in October 2012, based on approximate reproduction rates.|$|R

Only twice had three teammates <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> the first round, most recently when Steve Hosey, Tom Goodwin and Eddie Zosky of the Fresno State Bulldogs were selected {{in the first round of}} the 1989 Major League Baseball draft. Teammate David Aardsma, a relief pitcher, was also selected in the first round.|$|E
5|$|Lana is Sindi (Marisa Warrington) and Penny Watts' (Andrea McEwan) cousin. She {{was born}} in Australia, but her family moved to Canada when she was young. They {{returned}} to Australia a few years later, and Lana began attending Wattle Heights High School, where she was bullied over her sexuality. This led her to transfer to Erinsborough High. Lana finds employment at the Coffee Shop alongside Serena Bishop, whom she befriends. Lana is convinced {{that she had seen}} Serena before, and she realises that Serena had been in some photos taken by dodgy photographer Chris Cousens. Lana admits to Serena that she had also <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> by Chris and that she was not over it. Lana did not get on with Serena's cousin, Sky, and one day they fight at school. Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) places them in detention and urges them to work things out.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse {{have little}} {{interaction}} with people, primarily because most species live in arid unpopulated areas and at low densities. They are not generally sought after as game birds {{as they are}} not especially palatable, although they have on occasion <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> great numbers at water holes. An attempt to introduce them into Nevada failed {{but they have been}} introduced to Hawaii. No species is considered to be threatened although there have been some localised range contractions, particularly in Europe. A subspecies of the chestnut-bellied sandgrouse, P. e. floweri, was last seen in the Nile Valley of Egypt in 1979. It is thought to be extinct, but the reasons for this are unknown.|$|E

5|$|Jack is {{concerned}} for his mother, Colleen (Elaine Stritch). He tells Liz that {{the anniversary of}} his father, Jimmy Donaghy, abandoning their family is coming up and he is afraid of the effect it will have on Colleen. When Jack arrives at Colleen's hotel room {{to take her to}} dinner, however, he discovers she is staying with a man, Paul. Jack, worried she has <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> by a con man in her time of grief, asks his private investigator Lenny Wosniak (Steve Buscemi) to look into Paul. Wosniak cannot find anything distasteful in Paul's background, but tells Jack that he is married. Jack reveals this to his mother, but she says she knew and did not care. Colleen is also surprised that Jack thought the anniversary of Jimmy leaving would hurt her, noting that he had once left from the spring of 1957 until he came back and invited her to see Some Like It Hot. Jack talks this over with Liz and comes to realize that as Some Like It Hot was released in 1959, Jimmy Donaghy cannot have been his biological father because Jack was conceived in 1958, during the period Jimmy had been absent.|$|E
5|$|Reaching {{the top of}} the Halfaya Pass, the 22nd Guards Brigade group {{ran into}} heavy {{opposition}} from an Italian Bersaglieri infantry company, supported by anti-tank guns, under the command of Colonel Ugo Montemurro. This unit fought tenaciously, doing much to repair the poor impression Rommel had of his Italian allies. Opening fire upon the attacking British tanks, the Bersaglieri found their 47mm anti-tank guns to be unable to penetrate the armour of the Matilda infantry tanks. At , the gunners shifted targets. Now aiming at the tracks and undercarriages, when the tanks raised up crossing low stone walls and rocks, seven tanks were disabled. For his conduct during this action, Rommel recommended that Montemurro be awarded the Iron Cross First Class. At the cost of these seven tanks, the position was taken by CSquadron 4RTR and GCompany 2nd Scots Guards, and the brigade group pushed on towards the Bir Wair-Musaid road. At around 08:00, it received the surrender of a large German-Italian camp, and by 10:15 Bir Wair and Musaid had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> the face of limited opposition.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of this, Hugh DeWitt, a {{physicist}} at the Lawrence Livermore nuclear weapons laboratory, forwarded a copy to Chuck Hansen. Hansen was a computer programmer from Mountain View, California, who collected information about nuclear weapons as a hobby. He had run a competition to design an H-bomb, the winner {{of which would be}} the first person to have their design classified by the DOE. It now began to occur to him that his hobby might not be legal. On August 27, He wrote a letter to Senator Charles H. Percy detailing how much information he had deduced from publicly available sources. This included his own design, one not as good as Morland's, which Hansen had not seen. Hansen further charged that government scientists—including Edward Teller, Ted Taylor, and George Rathjens—had leaked sensitive information about thermonuclear weapons, for which no action had <b>been</b> <b>taken.</b> <b>In</b> this, Hansen was mistaken: Taylor had indeed been reprimanded, and Teller was not the source of the information that Hansen attributed to him. Hansen made copies of his letter available to several newspapers.|$|E
