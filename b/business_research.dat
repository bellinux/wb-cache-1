This article, dedicated to Professor Adolf Wagner, tries to differentiate three fields of research: Hypothesis formation in theory, characterisation of market imbalances and measurement of cycle and trend in empirical methods, short-term prognoses and turning point analyses in forecasting. Can we establish new hypotheses by considering expectations, gained from surveys? A special proposal aimed at the measure of the reference cycle by using the utilization of capacities in enterprises. It is evident, that when using business cycle indicators in <b>business</b> cycle <b>research</b> we can avoid the dichotomy between the three fields in <b>business</b> cycle <b>research,</b> which has been observed in the past. <b>Business</b> cycle <b>research,</b> <b>business</b> cycle indicators, reference cycle, leading indicators, measurement of cycle and trend, measurement without theory. ...|$|R

25|$|Today, Israel has the world’s most research-intensive {{business}} sector; in 2013, {{it alone}} performed 3.49% of GDP.

The country’s national innovation ecosystem relies on both foreign multinationals and large corporate investors in research and development, as well as on start-ups. According to the Israel Venture Capital Database, 264 foreign research centres are currently active in Israel. Many of these centres are owned by large multinational firms that have acquired Israeli companies, technology and know-how and transformed them through mergers and acquisitions into their own local research facilities. The activity of some research centres even spans more than three decades, such as those of Intel, Applied Materials, Motorola and IBM.|$|E

Some faculties' programs overlap: for instance, more than one house separate mathematics departments, although {{some of these are}} being merged; the Schulich School of Business offers undergraduate and graduate International Business Administration programmes and the Faculty of Liberal Arts & Professional Studies offers a Bachelor of Commerce with streams in Accounting, <b>Business</b> <b>Research,</b> Finance, Human Resources Management, Management, Management Science, and Marketing, as well as a minor in Business, to be taken in conjunction with a major in another discipline. The Schulich School of Business offers undergraduates with the option of pursuing a BBA or iBBA program with a component of mandatory exchange. Also, the Glendon and Schulich units are offering or are in the processes of preparing to offer degrees in public policy and administration. The University administration has, however, taken steps in some cases to unify departments in separate faculties, in part to support York's efforts to brand itself as a university focused on interdisciplinarity. For example, the Faculty of Health, opened on 1 July 2006, houses the School of Health Policy and Management, School of Kinesiology and Health Science, School of Nursing, and the Department of Psychology.|$|E
25|$|Business {{enterprises}} contributed 59.1 % of US GERD in 2012, {{down from}} 69.0 % in 2000. Private non-profits and foreign entities each contribute {{a small fraction}} of total R, 3.3% and 3.8% respectively. The USA has historically been a leader in business R and innovation. The economic recession of 2008–2009 has had a lasting impact, however. While the major performers of R largely maintained their commitments, the pain of the US recession was felt mainly by small businesses and start-ups. Statistics released by the US Census Bureau showed that, in 2008, the number of business ‘deaths’ began overtaking the number of business ‘births’ and that the trend continued at least through 2012. From 2003 to 2008, <b>business</b> <b>research</b> spending had followed a generally upward trajectory. In 2009, the curve inverted, as expenditure fell by 4% over the previous year then again in 2010, albeit by 1–2% this time. Companies in high-opportunity industries like health care cut back less than those in more mature industries, such as fossil fuels. The largest cutbacks in R spending were in agriculture production: -3.5% compared to the average R to net sales ratio. The chemicals and allied products industry and electronic equipment industry, on the other hand, showed R to net sales ratios that were 3.8% and 4.8% higher than average. Although the amount of R spending increased in 2011, it was still below the level of 2008 expenditure. By 2012, the growth rate of business-funded R had recovered. Whether this continues will be contingent on the pursuit of economic recovery and growth, levels of federal research funding and the general business climate.|$|E
