25|$|It was {{reported}} in September 2003, an SVR RF agent in London was making preparations to assassinate Boris Berezovsky with a <b>binary</b> <b>weapon,</b> {{and that is why}} Berezovsky had been speedily granted asylum in Britain. GRU officers who killed Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in Qatar in 2004 reportedly claimed that supporting SVR agents let them down by not evacuating them in time, so they have been arrested by Qatar authorities.|$|E
50|$|A {{cyclosarin}} <b>binary</b> <b>weapon</b> {{would most}} likely contain methylphosphonyl difluoride in one capsule, with the other capsule containing either cyclohexanol or a mixture of cyclohexylamine and cyclohexanol.|$|E
5000|$|In the 10th and 11th {{episodes of}} the 6th season of TV-series Dexter are shown {{preparation}} {{and application of}} <b>binary</b> <b>weapon</b> consisting of two containers filled with [...] DF and isopropyl alcohol. When mixed, the two substances form sarin.|$|E
5000|$|BIGEYE (an {{acronym for}} Binary Internally Generated {{chemical}} weapon within the [...] "EYE" [...] series of 500 pound canister weapons) was the common {{name for the}} BLU-80/B, a concept conceived during the 1950s. During the 1970s at Pine Bluff Arsenal around 200 test articles were produced. Initial production contracts for the BIGEYE were awarded in June, 1988, to The Marquardt Company of Van Nuys, CA, the project's prime contractor {{for most of the}} program. The original timeline for the U.S. <b>binary</b> chemical <b>weapons</b> program called for the BIGEYE to be deployed by September 1988. President Reagan authorized the spending of more than $59 million in 1986 to revive the <b>binary</b> chemical <b>weapons</b> program. Under the original timeline, the BIGEYE was to be the second <b>binary</b> chemical <b>weapon</b> to be produced (the first being a binary artillery shell) with binary chemical agent rockets to follow. After a General Accounting Office (GAO) report pointed out numerous flaws in the program the U.S. Senate moved to effectively kill the <b>binary</b> chemical <b>weapons</b> program, including the BIGEYE bomb. In 1989 President George H.W. Bush announced that the U.S. would retain the option to produce such <b>binary</b> <b>weapons.</b> At the time of his announcement, 1992 was the earliest date BIGEYES were expected to be deployed.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Army Chemical Corps was {{reactivated}} in 1976 {{to assess}} and deal with this threat, and with it came the increased desire to acquire a retaliatory chemical capability {{in the form of}} much safer <b>binary</b> chemical <b>weapons.</b> Initially, the United States was in with the Soviet Union, and then-President Jimmy Carter rejected U.S. Army requests for authorization of the <b>binary</b> chemical <b>weapons</b> program. The talks deteriorated, and President Carter eventually granted the request Army request. However, at the last minute Carter pulled the provision from the budget. This action left the decision on a retaliatory <b>binary</b> chemical <b>weapons</b> option to the Ronald Reagan administration.|$|R
50|$|According to Mirzayanov, the Soviets also {{developed}} weapons that were safer to handle, {{leading to the}} development of the <b>binary</b> <b>weapons,</b> in which precursors for the nerve agents are mixed in a munition to produce the agent just prior to its use. Because the precursors are generally significantly less hazardous than the agents themselves, this technique makes handling and transporting the munitions a great deal simpler.|$|R
5000|$|According to Alexander Litvinenko, a Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) {{officer in}} London was {{preparing}} to assassinate Berezovsky with a <b>binary</b> <b>weapon</b> in September 2003. This alleged plot was reported to British police. Hazel Blears, then a Home Office Minister, said that inquiries made these claims were [...] "unable to either substantiate this information or find evidence of any criminal offences having been committed".|$|E

50|$|A {{miniature}} <b>binary</b> <b>weapon</b> {{is used in}} {{an assassination}} in the Frederick Forsyth novel The Devil's Alternative. It consists of two half-capsules, a non-resistant one containing potassium cyanide and an acid-resistant one containing hydrochloric acid. The substances mix after the halves are assembled and the seal between them is broken, and form hydrogen cyanide. The surplus acid eats through the capsule walls of the non-resistant half, and after a delay of several hours, the lethal content is released into the intestinal tract of whoever ingested it.|$|E
5000|$|Isopropylamine was {{included}} {{as part of}} the M687 155 mm field artillery shell, which was a <b>binary</b> sarin <b>weapon</b> system developed by the US Army.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. {{ratified}} the Geneva Protocol which banned {{the use of}} {{chemical and biological weapons}} on January 22, 1975. In 1989 and 1990, the U.S. and the Soviet Union entered an agreement to both end their chemical <b>weapons</b> programs, including <b>binary</b> <b>weapons.</b> In April 1997, the United States {{ratified the}} Chemical Weapons Convention, this banned the possession of most types of chemical weapons. It also banned the development of chemical weapons, and required the destruction of existing stockpiles, precursor chemicals, production facilities, and their weapon delivery systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{administration}} virtually ignored {{reports of}} Moscow's continuing covert development {{and production of}} binary nerve agents, and made no visible attempt to induce Moscow to terminate the programs—until last week, when the Washington Times made public a classified Pentagon report. The report described Foliant, the code name of a supersecret program begun under the Soviets to develop nerve agents so lethal that microscopic amounts can kill. One of those substances is A-232 of the Novichok class of <b>binary</b> <b>weapons,</b> which were designed to circumvent future bans on such agents.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of VR {{started in the}} late 1950s by a team from the Soviet Union's Scientific Research Institute No. 42 (NII-42). Sergei Zotovich Ivin, Leonid Soborovsky, and Iya Danilovna Shilakova jointly developed this analogue of VX. They completed their work in 1963 and were later awarded the Lenin Prize for their achievement. A <b>binary</b> <b>weapon</b> comprising two less toxic precursors which mixed during flight to form Substance 33 was later developed by {{a team led by}} Nikolai Kuznetsov, for which they were awarded the 1990 Lenin Prize.|$|E
5000|$|The testing, {{which had}} mixed results, {{presented}} {{its own set}} of problems. In 1987 the Navy and Air Force conducted 70+ tests, results which were unfairly characterized as [...] "very inconsistent" [...] by to the GAO. Following a test suspension and subsequent significant design improvements, vastly better weapons function and reliability results were achieved. Problems the Navy encountered with the BIGEYE included excessive pressure build-up, questions about the lethality of the chemical mixture resulting from variable mix times, and overall reliability concerns. Scientists debated the efficacy of the <b>binary</b> <b>weapons</b> program, especially since the BIGEYE had only been tested using simulants, despite the fact that extensive and highly representative kinetic and kinematic simulant tests were performed. This again confirmed GAO's lack of scientific/engineering understanding of the weapon concept/deployment strategy. Unfortunately, GAO's less than informed report led to speculation that <b>binary</b> <b>weapons</b> might be inferior to those of the unitary weapons they were intended to replace despite their inherent safety for US military personnel. The GAO repeatedly backed these assertions without engineering substantiation, maintaining that the BIGEYE was not adequately tested and that it had encountered major technical issues. While the program did encounter major technical issues, the Navy with its USAF and USA partners successfully resolved all of the legitimate engineering issues and developed highly effective mission profiles for the weapon.|$|R
50|$|In September 1992, Vil Mirzayanov, a {{dissident}} Russian scientist {{who worked for}} 26 years on the clandestine programs, wrote an article in Moscow News describing the existence and nature of Novichok, and the specific intent to circumvent the CWC. More details emerged {{over the next two}} years as authorities persecuted—but never disputed—Mr. Mirzayanov. One of Russia's top <b>binary</b> <b>weapons</b> scientists, Vladimir Uglev, revealed the existence of A-232—which he personally developed—in an interview with the magazine Novoye Vremya in early 1994. And in May 1994 Mr. Mirzayanov wrote about A-232 and other substances in an article for this page.|$|R
50|$|Together with {{isopropyl}} alcohol {{it is used}} in some <b>binary</b> chemical <b>weapons</b> (e.g. M687), as a mixture called OPA which in turn mixed with methylphosphonyl difluoride (known to the military as DF) produces sarin gas.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{of these}} agents are <b>binary</b> <b>weapons,</b> in which {{precursors}} for the nerve agents are mixed in a munition {{to produce the}} agent just prior to its use. Because the precursors are generally significantly less hazardous than the agents themselves, this technique makes handling and transporting the munitions a great deal simpler. Additionally, precursors to the agents are usually much easier to stabilize than the agents themselves, so this technique also {{made it possible to}} increase the shelf life of the agents. However this has the disadvantage that careless preparation or preparation by untrained individuals may produce a non-optimal agent. During the 1980s and 1990s, binary versions of several Soviet agents were developed and are designated as [...] "Novichok" [...] agents.|$|R
50|$|<b>Binary</b> {{chemical}} <b>weapons</b> are {{chemical weapons}} {{within the scope}} of the Chemical Weapons Convention and therefore their production, use and stockpiling is forbidden in most countries, as {{at least one of the}} individual chemicals is likely to be a Schedule 1 chemical for which large scale production is forbidden.|$|R
5000|$|QL is a {{component}} in <b>binary</b> chemical <b>weapons,</b> mainly VX nerve agent. It, along with Methylphosphonyl difluoride (DF), was {{developed during the}} 1980s in order to replace an aging stockpile of unitary chemical weapons. QL is listed as a [...] "Schedule One" [...] chemical by the Chemical Weapons Convention.|$|R
50|$|In December 2006, CMA {{successfully}} completed demolition of the nation’s former chemical warfare production facilities. In November 2007, it {{successfully completed}} {{destruction of the}} <b>binary</b> chemical <b>weapon</b> inventory. In January 2012, all chemical weapons had been destroyed at the 7 sites CMA had responsibility for, with 89.75% of the U.S.'s 1997 stockpile eliminated.|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} the Japanese proposal, the current {{disarmament}} talks, the Administration 2 ̆ 7 s review of the United States 2 ̆ 7 chemical warfare policy, the Defense Department 2 ̆ 7 s request for appropriations for production of <b>binary</b> <b>weapons,</b> and the as yet unratified Convention on Bacteriological Weapons and Toxins, it seems {{more important than ever}} for the Senate to give its advice and consent to the ratification of the Geneva Protocol. Since the dispute between the Administration and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is over the interpretation of the scope of the Protocol 2 ̆ 7 s chemical warfare prohibition, it seems particularly appropriate at this time {{to determine whether or not}} the use of tear gas in war is prohibited by the Geneva Protocol. This is the focus of the Comment that follows...|$|R
50|$|In the end, the BLU-80/B BIGEYE <b>binary</b> {{chemical}} <b>weapon</b> {{may well}} have been the tipping point in chemical weapons disarmament talks with the then USSR, as the Soviets agreed to significant chemical weapons disarmament agreements immediately after successful operational test results of the BIGEYE resulting from improvements implemented by the U.S. Navy's Naval Air Weapons Center, China Lake.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the newly developed [...] "third generation" [...] <b>weapons,</b> <b>binary</b> versions of several Soviet agents were developed and were designated as [...] "Novichok" [...] agents.|$|R
50|$|Numbers are {{occasionally}} {{added to}} military symbols to reflect particular preparations. With riot control agents a 1 signifies micropulverized (e.g., CS1), and a 2 signified microencapsulated (e.g., CS2). With biological agents a 1 signifies a wet-type agent (e.g., UL1), and a 2 signifies a dry-type agent (e.g., UL2). <b>Binary</b> chemical <b>weapons</b> are signified {{by adding a}} 2, as in binary sarin (i.e., GB2).|$|R
50|$|<b>Binary</b> {{chemical}} <b>weapons</b> or munitions are {{chemical weapons}} which contain the toxic agent in its active state as chemical precursors which are significantly less toxic than the agent. This improves {{the safety of}} storing, transporting, and disposing of the weapon. Commonly, firing the munition removes a barrier between two precursors. These react to form the intended agent which is then aerosolized and distributed by a bursting charge.|$|R
50|$|Harry {{flies to}} St. Petersburg, Russia, {{where he is}} met by Nikolai (Jason Connery). They are {{followed}} and shot at by Chechens, before Nick (as Harry insists on calling him) and Natasha (Mia Sara) can deliver Harry to his potential employer, Alex (Michael Gambon). Alex tells Harry that a deadly <b>binary</b> biological <b>weapon</b> called Alorex has been stolen; he wants Harry to find it. Harry cannot turn down the pay: $250,000.|$|R
50|$|One {{example of}} a <b>binary</b> {{chemical}} <b>weapon</b> is the United States Army M687. In the M687, methylphosphonyl difluoride (military name: DF, a Schedule 1 chemical) and a mixture of 2 agents held in chambers within the munition, separated by a partition. When the weapon is fired, acceleration causes the partition to break, and the precursors are mixed by {{the rotation of the}} munition in flight, producing sarin nerve agent.|$|R
5000|$|The 2002 movie xXx {{features}} a Soviet-made <b>binary</b> chemical <b>weapon</b> codenamed [...] "Silent Night", after its supposed ability to render an area silent by killing its inhabitants. In the movie, the chemical {{was acquired by}} the terrorist group Anarchy-99, and their leader, Yorgi, plans to launch missiles containing Silent Night from an autonomous solar-powered submarine called Ahab, {{with the intent to}} sow chaos among civilized nations as they all blame each other for the attacks.|$|R
5000|$|VX {{can also}} be {{delivered}} in <b>binary</b> chemical <b>weapons</b> which mix in-flight to form the agent prior to release. Binary VX {{is referred to as}} VX2, [...] and is created by mixing O-(2-diisopropylaminoethyl) O&prime;-ethyl methylphosphonite (Agent QL) with elemental sulfur (Agent NE) as is done in the Bigeye aerial chemical bomb. It may also be produced by mixing with sulfur compounds, as with the liquid dimethyl polysulfide mixture (Agent NM) in the canceled XM736 8-inch projectile program.|$|R
50|$|As the {{stockpile}} of U.S. unitary (live agent) chemical weapons {{began to show}} troubling leakage, the Department of Defense (DoD) became {{acutely aware of the}} safety hazard to military personnel and public backlash this could generate. It is now known that the Soviets experienced the same and likely worse leakage issues with their unitary live agent weapons. With this in mind, the Pentagon insisted that it needed a <b>binary</b> chemical <b>weapons</b> program to counter and deter a Soviet or third-world chemical attack threat.|$|R
5000|$|Pine Bluff Arsenal stored 90,409 M55 GB rockets, 19,608 M55 VX rockets, 9,378 M23 VX landmines and 3,705 mustard ton containers. It {{was also}} the home for the <b>Binary</b> Chemical <b>Weapons</b> Facility. The {{facility}} created the two toxic agents that would combine to form VX as well as built the bombs to deliver the nerve agent. Construction of the facility began in the mid-1980s and was mothballed prior to completion in the early 1990s {{as part of the}} chemical weapons treaties [...]|$|R
50|$|The 25 {{year old}} plus, on again off again, BIGEYE bomb program was plagued with {{problems}} and controversy from its outset. Much {{of the controversy}} was based on inaccurate and uninformed analysis by the then Government Accountability Office (GAO). The Army Chemical Corps was accused of interest in <b>binary</b> chemical <b>weapons</b> only to enhance its recent reactivation; critics also charged the Army was opposed to arms control talks. Also criticized was the entire idea of a modern American chemical weapons program. Such a program, the argument went, would actually encourage others to develop chemical weapons, as opposed to acting as a deterrent.|$|R
5000|$|Along with nerve agents such as tabun and VX, sarin {{can have}} a short shelf life. Therefore, it is usually stored as two {{separate}} precursors that produce sarin when combined. [...] Sarin's shelf life can be extended by increasing {{the purity of the}} precursor and intermediates and incorporating stabilizers such as tributylamine. In some formulations, tributylamine is replaced by diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), allowing sarin to be stored in aluminium casings. In <b>binary</b> chemical <b>weapons,</b> the two precursors are stored separately in the same shell and mixed to form the agent immediately before or when the shell is in flight. This approach has the dual benefit of solving the stability issue and increasing the safety of sarin munitions.|$|R
5000|$|The BLU-80/B BIGEYE {{bomb was}} a {{developmental}} U.S. air-launched <b>binary</b> chemical <b>weapon.</b> The BIGEYE was a 500-pound class glide bomb with a radar altimeter fuze intended to disperse the binary generated nerve agent VX, made in {{flight from the}} non-lethal chemical components [...] "QL" [...] and sulfur only after aircraft release. The BLU-80-B was designed {{under the auspices of}} the U.S. Navy as a safe chemical weapons alternative in response to chemical weapons (CW) threats from the USSR and other actors. BIGEYE was a genuine tri-Service program led by the U.S. Navy with significant U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force participation. Initially approved in the 1950s, the program persisted into the 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|On 24 February, Malaysia's {{police chief}} Khalid Abu Bakar {{announced}} that a post-mortem toxicology report had found traces of the nerve agent VX on Kim's face. According to experts, the use of VX gas may explain why two assailants were involved, because each assailant [...] "could have wiped two or more precursors" [...] in Kim's face. This {{is referred to as}} a <b>binary</b> chemical <b>weapon.</b> This method could ensure that the assailants were not themselves killed by the poison, which can be fatal in very small amounts; additionally, smuggling the chemical components into Malaysia separately could have helped avoid detection. Aisyah reported she vomited in the taxi afterward and has continued to feel unwell.|$|R
50|$|The M687 is an American 155 mm <b>binary</b> sarin {{chemical}} <b>weapon</b> artillery shell. The {{design was}} standardized in 1976 and production began on December 16, 1987 at Pine Bluff Arsenal, Pine Bluff, Arkansas. Production was halted three years later, following a June 1990 chemical weapon destruction treaty with Russia, and {{the dismantling of}} existing stocks began in November 1997 at Hawthorne Army Depot, Nevada. America's remaining stocks were stored at the Deseret Chemical Depot, Utah, and the Umatilla Chemical Depot (Umatilla County, Oregon).|$|R
