25|$|Since {{the melted}} metal flows {{out of the}} workpiece, there must be room on the {{opposite}} side of the workpiece for the spray to exit. When possible, pieces of metal are cut on a grate that lets the melted metal fall freely to the ground. The same equipment can be used for oxyacetylene <b>blowtorches</b> and welding torches, by exchanging the part of the torch in front of the torch valves.|$|E
25|$|<b>Blowtorching</b> {{is another}} {{climbing}} induced impact {{that affects the}} rocks themselves. <b>Blowtorching</b> is when a climber uses a <b>blowtorch</b> to dry holds on a wet route. This mainly happens in areas that tend to have wet climbing conditions. <b>Blowtorching</b> is not only detrimental to the rock itself and can have permanent damage but it also leaves a very large burn mark that most non-climbers would object to the appearance of.|$|R

Its most prominent feature is its copper dome, which is green with oxidation, much like the Statue of Liberty. When the building was constructed, {{it was one of the}} first on campus to use rebar. Its architect, A Professor F. E. Giesecke knew little about reinforced concrete, [...] "so [...] just figured out the amount of steel...necessary and doubled it". The result was an extremely durable building so filled with steel that <b>blowtorches</b> had to be used when piping for water fountains was added.

Moving forward, Rodriques expects to pay back the remainder of the funding with proceeds from the two properties currently in development. <b>Blowtorch</b> does not currently have a functioning website.
