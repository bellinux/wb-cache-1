2500|$|Internally {{the rotor}} is cooled and {{lubricated}} by engine sump {{oil and the}} aforementioned trochoid pump. Engine oil is filtered by an easily accessible car-type oil filter on the lower {{right side of the}} cases. The filter includes an internal bypass valve in case of blockage. Further lubrication specifically for the tip, corner and side seals is provided by oil from a tank located under the seat. An engine-driven metering pump sends oil from this external tank into the carburetor at a ratio of around 100:1. Metering of the oil quantity is mechanically controlled by cables from the throttle grip. The metering pump also provided lubrication for the final drive chain. A second line is routed from the metering pump and around the bike, ending just above the drive chain behind the sprocket cover. This feature was also disconnected on the [...] "A" [...] models by a simple <b>blanking</b> <b>plug</b> at the metering pump. The gearbox is separated from the engine sump and has its own oil supply. Suzuki marketed its own brand of rotary oil but also approved at least two other oils for use in its rotary engine. Shell Super 10-20-50 and Castrol GTX were both endorsed lubricants.|$|E
50|$|The DT200R shares similar engine {{cases with}} the ATV BLASTER - But the Blaster is not crank case {{induction}} like the DT200R. Both DT200R & Blaster crank shafts are compatible, the DT200R piston doesn't have port's like the Blaster, but the Blaster piston {{can be used}} with the DT200R. In the Blaster version & some of the DT200WR versions the oil pump is not installed, <b>blanking</b> <b>plug</b> is fitted over the oil pump drive.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the voice}} emitter and exhale valve cover {{is smaller than}} that of the S10, as are the lenses. The FM12 has an overall lower profile than the S10 and sits closer to the wearer's face. The FM12's {{drinking}} tube is also longer {{than that of the}} S10, making drinking easier while wearing the mask. The FM12 also has an inner mask to prevent fogging of the lenses. The 'ridge' present {{around the edge of the}} S10 is also absent from the FM12.The main noticeable difference between the FM12 and the S10 is the ability of some FM12's to mount 2 filters to the mask simultaneously, as was done by the SBS in the Gulf War. When only 1 filter is fitted to a mask that has the ability to accept 2 filters, a <b>blanking</b> <b>plug</b> must be used.|$|E

40|$|The <b>blanking</b> <b>plug,</b> Burton Part No 82530 - 12 - 5502 - 3212 - 0000 NR, which blocks off {{the charge}} lead on Autoub 6000 leaked water during two {{missions}} on the JC 027 cruise. An investigation showed fibres had become trapped inside the connector {{which would have}} caused a leak. Measurement of the plug and connector shows the secondary seal around the pins and sockets to be marginal. Care to avoid debris being trapped and better tools to aid tightening the connector will avoid {{a repeat of the}} problem...|$|E
5000|$|The M47TUD20 {{introduced}} new common failure points. Chief {{among these}} {{was a new}} 'swirl flap' mechanism embedded in the inlet manifold. This consisted {{of a number of}} butterfly valves within each individual inlet tract, which are secured to an actuating rod via two small screws. It has become clear that over time these screws can come loose via vibration etc. When this happens they can end up being drawn into the respective cylinder, causing significant damage to piston, cylinder head and valves. If unlucky further damage can be caused to the turbo if the screw then makes its way through the exhaust valve into the manifold and subsequently into the turbo. These failures have occurred in such quantity that a number of specialist BMW magazines have featured articles on the problem including information on how to remove the swirl flaps. [...] For those who wish to perform some preventive maintenance on the M47TUD20 engine, there are companies who supply and/or fit <b>blanking</b> <b>plugs</b> to allow the removal of these swirl flaps altogether. BMW addressed the problem by introducing stronger swirl flaps and larger diameter spindles - made from plastic - in 2006.|$|R
