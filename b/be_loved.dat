50|$|In the 12th century, Bernard of Clairvaux {{developed}} {{the idea of}} the ladder of love in his treatise, On the Love of God. This ladder had four rungs or degrees. The first and lowest degree <b>was</b> <b>love</b> of self for self. The second degree <b>was</b> <b>love</b> of God for what he gives. The third degree <b>was</b> <b>love</b> of God for his own sake; it would not be difficult, according to Bernard, for those who truly loved God to keep his commandments. The fourth degree <b>was</b> <b>love</b> of self only for God's sake; it was believed that this degree of perfection in <b>love</b> <b>was</b> only rarely achieved before death.|$|R
25|$|The show often {{includes}} strong, brassy, long-suffering {{women who}} exhibit diva-like behaviour and stoically battle through {{an array of}} tragedy and misfortune. Such characters include Angie Watts, Kathy Beale, Sharon Watts, Pat Butcher, Denise Fox and Tanya Branning. Conversely there are female characters who handle tragedy less well, depicted as eternal victims and endless sufferers, who include Sue Osman, Little Mo Mitchell, Laura Beale, Lisa Fowler, Ronnie Mitchell and Linda Carter. The 'tart with a heart' is another recurring character, often popular with viewers. Often their promiscuity masks a hidden vulnerability {{and a desire to}} <b>be</b> <b>loved.</b> Such characters have included Pat Butcher (though in her latter years, this changed), Tiffany Mitchell, Kat Slater, Stacey Slater, Dawn Swann and Roxy Mitchell.|$|E
25|$|Asher's scars are {{hesitant}} {{around the}} face and groin, noted by Anita that {{it was as if}} the Priests flinched at the destruction of such beauty. The Priests (never said which denomination, but it is assumed Catholic) used Holy Water in an attempt to save Asher's soul (from what is never said, either). Asher is moody with a sadistic mean streak, lashing out at everyone in his fits of melancholic pain. He wants most to <b>be</b> <b>loved</b> and devoted by Jean-Claude, more a lover of men than women. Asher knows that it is through Anita's attraction to him combined with Jean-Claude's that Jean-Claude returns the love. Without Anita's acceptance, Jean-Claude could never bring himself to nearly be consumed for want of Asher again. That coupled with the incident of Asher nearly bleeding Anita to death during their first and only exclusive sexual experience leads to Asher's emotional neglect. Neither Anita nor Jean-Claude trust themselves alone with Asher, but as a trio, they live in nearly perfect love.|$|E
