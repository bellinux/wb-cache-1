5|$|The Do 17P-2 was {{identical}} to the P-1, with the additional installation of an ETC 500 <b>bomb</b> <b>rack</b> under the fuselage. These aircraft were designed for night reconnaissance. It is assumed that Dornier converted most, if not all, P-2 models from existing P-1 production aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Fw 190 F-3: Developed {{under the}} {{designation}} Fw 190 A-5/U17, which was {{outfitted with a}} centreline mounted ETC 501 <b>bomb</b> <b>rack.</b> The Fw 190 F-3/R1 it had two additional ETC 50 bomb racks under each wing. The F-3 could carry a 66-Imp gal (300 liter) drop tank. A total of 432 Fw 190 F-3s were built.|$|E
25|$|Fw 190 A-3/U3 — The A-3/U3 was {{the first}} of the Jabo (Jagdbomber), using an ETC-501 {{centre-line}} <b>bomb</b> <b>rack</b> able to carry up to 500kg (1,100lb) of bombs or, with horizontal stabilising bars, one 300L (80US gal) standard Luftwaffe drop tank. The U3 retained the fuselage-mounted 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17s and the wing-mounted 20mm MG 151 cannon, with the outer MG FF being removed.|$|E
5|$|The {{fuselage}} bomb bay used four <b>bomb</b> <b>racks,</b> {{in later}} versions eight modular standard <b>bomb</b> <b>racks</b> designed to carry one SC 250kg (550lb) bomb or four SC 50kg (110lb) bombs each in nose up orientation. These modular standard <b>bomb</b> <b>racks</b> were a common feature {{on the first}} generation of Luftwaffe bombers, but it turned out that they limited the ordnance selection to bombs of only two sizes. These racks were abandoned in later designs.|$|R

25|$|Fw 190 A-4/U8 — The A-4/U8 was the Jabo-Rei (Jagdbomber Reichweite, {{long-range}} fighter-bomber), adding twin standard Luftwaffe 300L (80US gal) drop tanks, {{one under}} each wing, on VTr-Ju 87 racks with duralumin fairings produced by Weserflug, and a centreline <b>bomb</b> <b>rack.</b> The outer wing-mounted 20mm MG FF/M cannon and the cowling-mounted 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 were removed to save weight. The A-4/U8 was the precursor of the Fw 190 G-1.|$|E
25|$|Fw 190 F-8: Based on the A-8 Fighter, {{having a}} {{slightly}} modified injector on the compressor which allowed for increased performance at lower altitudes for several minutes. Armament of the Fw 190 F-8 was two 20mm MG 151/20 cannon in the wing roots and two 13mm (.51in) MG 131 machine guns above the engine. It was outfited with an ETC 501 <b>Bomb</b> <b>rack</b> as centerline mount and four ETC 50 bomb racks as underwing mounts.|$|E
25|$|The {{rack and}} {{internal}} fuel lines for carrying a 300L (80US gal) under-fuselage drop-tank were widely used on G-2s, {{as were the}} underwing 20mm MG 151/20 cannon gondolas. Several G-2s were fitted with the ETC 500 <b>bomb</b> <b>rack,</b> capable of carrying one 250kg (550lb) bomb. The final G-2 production batches built by Erla and Messerschmitt Regensburg were equipped as tropical aircraft (often referred to as G-2 trop), equipped with a sand-filter {{on the front of}} the supercharger intake and two small, teardrop-shaped metal brackets on the left side of the fuselage, below the cockpit sill. These were used as mounts for specially designed sun umbrellas (called Sonderwerkzeug or Special tool), which were used to shade the cockpit.|$|E

25|$|Approximately {{three minutes}} after the initial {{explosion}}, a bomb mounted on the Phantom exploded, having been engulfed in flames from the earlier explosions and burning fuel. This explosion blew a larger hole, approximately eight feet by seven feet, in the flight deck. The heat from the blast ignited additional fires on the 03 level, and debris from the explosion caused holes in the deck; this allowed burning fuel to spread further, entering the 02 and 01 levels and eventually the first deck. This explosion also damaged the twin agent units that provided firefighting foam to the area, rendering them inoperable as well as severing fire hoses in the area. In short order two 500 lb (227 kg) Mark 82 bombs detonated in succession. Several {{minutes after the}} detonations a <b>bomb</b> <b>rack</b> holding three Mk 82 bombs exploded. This blast tore a large hole, approximately 18 feet by 22 feet, into the flight deck, and ruptured a 6,000-gallon fuel tank mounted on a tanker aircraft; a massive fireball resulted from the fuel igniting, spreading the fire further. All told, eighteen explosions occurred, blowing eight holes into the flight deck and beyond.|$|E
500|$|The H-5 series {{followed}} in February 1941, with heavier defensive armament. Like the H-4, it retained a PVC 1006 L <b>bomb</b> <b>rack</b> to {{enable it to}} carry heavy bombs under the fuselage. The first ten He 111H-5s were pathfinders, and selected for special missions. The aircraft sometimes carried 25kg flashlight bombs which acted as flares. The H-5 could also carry heavy fire bombs, either heavy containers or smaller incendiary devices attached to parachutes. The H-5 also carried LM A and LM B aerial mines for anti-shipping operations. After the 80th production aircraft, the PVC 1006 L <b>bomb</b> <b>rack</b> was removed and replaced with a heavy-duty ETC 2000 rack, enabling the H-5 to carry the SC 2500 [...] "Max" [...] bomb, on the external ETC 2000 rack, which enabled it to support the [...] bomb.|$|E
500|$|After the Battle of Britain, {{smaller scale}} {{production}} of the H-4s began. The H-4 was virtually identical to the He 111P-4 with the DB 600s swapped for the Jumo 211D-1s. Some also used the Jumo 211H-1. This variant also differed from the H-3 in that it could either carry 2,000kg (4,410lb) of bombs internally or mount one or two external racks to carry one 1,800kg (3,970lb) or two 1,000kg (2,210lb) bombs. As these external racks blocked the internal bomb bay doors, a combination of internal and external storage was not possible. A PVR 1006L <b>bomb</b> <b>rack</b> was fitted externally and an 835L (221US gal) tank added to the interior spaces left vacant by {{the removal of the}} internal bomb-bay. The PVR 1006L was capable of carrying a SC 1000 1,000kg (2,210lb) bomb. Some H-4s had their PVC racks modified to drop torpedoes. Later modifications enabled the PVC 1006 to carry a 2,500kg (5,510lb) [...] "Max" [...] bomb. However 1,000kg (2,200lb) [...] "Hermann" [...] or 1,800kg (3,970lb) [...] "Satans" [...] were used more widely.|$|E

500|$|... 12 combat {{missions}} between 20 and 29 July against {{targets in}} Japan dropping high-explosive pumpkin bombs, in which 37 B-29 sorties delivered conventional-bomb replications of the Fat Man: four on 20 July, three on 24 July, two on 26 July, and three on 29 July. Some 27 sorties were made visually and 10 by radar, striking 17 primary targets, 15 secondary targets, and five targets of opportunity. Two other aircraft did not drop their bombs: one jettisoned its pumpkin bomb {{into the sea}} near Iwo Jima, and the Strange Cargos bomb came loose from the <b>bomb</b> <b>rack</b> and plunged through the closed bomb bay doors while the bomber {{was still on the}} ground. One B-29 incurred minor battle damage in the attacks. Flying at [...] put them above the effective range of flak. Each pumpkin bomb mission was conducted by a formation of three aircraft in the hope of convincing the Japanese military that small groups of B-29s did not justify a strong response. This strategy proved successful, and Japanese fighters only occasionally attempted to intercept the 509th Composite Group's aircraft.|$|E
500|$|The Do 17E-1 was {{equipped}} with two BMW VI 7.3D inline engines of 750 PS each. The crew numbered three. The radio operator manned the two 7.92mm MG 15 machine guns within a B-Stand pod in the rear cockpit. They had 750 rounds of ammunition. The bomb bay was divided into two compartments. Each had five bomb racks with individual capacity of [...] A single ETC 500/IX <b>bomb</b> <b>rack</b> could be mounted externally underneath the aircraft to carry a 500kg bomb. A Do17E-1 with the designation D-AJUN was tested with an unusual configuration, two SC 500 bombs mounted side by side under the fuselage. It showed a notable performance reduction due {{to the increase in}} weight and drag, this configuration was not used operationally. The E-1 continued to carry low bomb loads into the Second World War. The performance of the E-1 enabled it to reach a speed of 330km/h (205mph) at 3,000 m (9,842ft). Conducting a shallow dive the light frame of the Do 17 could reach 500km/h (310mph). Its maximum ceiling was 5,500 m (18,044ft).|$|E

These were fitted with either an ETC 500 <b>bomb</b> <b>rack,</b> carrying one 250kg (550lb) bomb, or four 50kg (110lb) bombs. The E-1 was also fitted with the Reflexvisier [...] "Revi" [...] gunsight.
