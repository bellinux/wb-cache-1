40|$|Abstract The {{abundant}} use of brominated {{flame retardants}} (BFRs) in modern polymers has over the passed decades resulted in {{contamination of the}} environment, and BFRs are increasingly found in fish. Laboratory {{studies have shown that}} a number of BFRs and BFR-metabolites can interfere with thyroid and (sex) steroid hormone function (endocrine disruption). The studies presented in this thesis investigate whether exposure to environmentally relevant BFRs is likely to cause endocrine disruption and failure of reproduction in fish. To address this question, we carried out long term exposure studies with the most frequently found BFRs: tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), and a <b>brominated</b> <b>diphenylether</b> mixture (PentaBDE). Juvenile flounder (Platichthys flesus, a common flatfish in estuaries along the European coastal zone) and adult reproducing zebrafish (Danio rerio, a freshwater cyprinid) were used as test species. Flounders were exposed to TBBPA for 105 days via the water, and to HBCD and PBDE (78 and 101 days, respectively) via food and/or sediment. Zebrafish were exposed to the test substances via the water. Exposure of adults was for four weeks, followed by exposure of eggs and juveniles until six weeks after hatching, which enabled monitoring of reproduction and juvenile development (partial life-cycle approach). Exposed fish were examined macroscopically and histologically with emphasis on reproductive and endocrine organs. Plasma thyroid hormone (T 3 and T 4) concentrations were determined in all flounder studies and in zebrafish exposed to PentaBDE. Cytochrome P 4501 A (CYP 1 A) activity (EROD) was determined in livers from flounder as indication for dioxin-like effects. Activities of the steroidogenic enzyme CYP 19 (aromatase) were determined in flounder gonads, and production of the yolk precursor protein vitellogenin (VTG) was determined in plasma from flounder exposed to TBBPA. Concentrations of BFRs in tissue from exposed fish were evaluated to provide a dose background for risk assessment. All exposures resulted in a linear increase of internal BFR concentrations with exposure concentrations. Whereas the concentrations in zebrafish were generally higher, the range in flounder included environmentally relevant concentrations. Exposure of flounder to TBBPA resulted in an increase in the concentration of thyroid hormone T 4 in plasma and a mild increase of aromatase activity in testes. In zebrafish, egg production and juvenile survival were reduced. Significant effects occurred at internal concentrations that were at least 10 times the highest levels observed in fish in the environment. Exposure to HBCD did not result in adverse effects in flounder or zebrafish (reported elsewhere). Exposure to a mixture of PBDEs resulted in juvenile mortality in zebrafish at the highest PBDE concentrations, and a mild decrease of aromatase activity in ovaries, and plasma T 4 concentrations in flounder. Dose-response modeling indicates that T 4 concentrations and CYP 19 activities could be affected at internal concentrations that have in exceptional cases been observed in fresh water fish in the wild. However, concentrations in estuarine and marine fish are usually around two orders of magnitude lower indicating a limited risk for estuarine and marine fish. In general, the studies presented in this thesis show minimal indications for endocrine effects of exposure to BFRs in fish at concentrations observed in the environment...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: One of the {{challenges}} in analytical chemistry has been the deter-mination of polybrominated-dibenzodioxins (PBDD) and polybrominated di-benzofurans (PBDF) in resin matrices containing <b>brominated</b> <b>diphenylethers</b> as flame retardants. This is mainly because <b>brominated</b> <b>diphenylethers</b> se-verely interfere with PBDD/PBDF analyses. A new method which eliminates this problem is described below. This new procedure effectively removes the brominated diphenyl ethers in the sample, or reduces them to a level where mathematical corrections can be made. In addi-tion, a new approach is used which allows isomer-specific determination of PBDD/PBDFs {{without the need for}} a complete set of analytical standards. Re-sults from the use of this method in the analysis of PBDD/PBDF in flame re-tarded ASB resins and processing fumes are presented...|$|R
40|$|Baltic herring (Clupea harengus) oil was {{extracted}} and fractionated. To {{examine the}} contribution to toxicity and biological effects of different halogenated organic pollutants, the herring {{oil and the}} fractions were mixed into pelleted food and given to Sprague-Dawley female rats at three levels, corresponding to a human intake of 1. 6, 8. 2 and 34. 4 kg fish per week. Herring oil, its fractions, as well as liver tissues from exposed rats, were analyzed for: eight chlorinated biphenyls, all 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, hexachlorocyclohexanes, hexachlorobenzene, 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- 2, 2 -bis(4 -chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT), DDT-metabolites, three <b>brominated</b> <b>diphenylethers</b> as well as extractable organically bound chlorine and halogenated fatty acids. A bioassay (EROD) was used for measuring the dioxin-like enzyme induction activity. Nordic Sea lodda (Mallotus villosus) oil {{was used as a}} nutritionally equivalent control, with much lower levels of halogenated organic pollutants. A full toxicological subchronic examination is reported in the following paper (Stern et al. 2002). In this study, we report that the fractionation procedure resulted in a substantial reduction of most of the pollutants in the triacylglycerol fraction, and a pronounced enrichment of most of the pollutants into the two other fractions. However, all contaminants were present at some levels in all of the fractions. The concentrations of organoltalogens found in this study were representative for Baltic herring during the mid- 1990 s. Rat liver tissue showed similar residue patterns as the diet, with the exception of chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and dibenzofuran congeners that had a higher liver retention than pesticides, chlorinated biphenyls and <b>brominated</b> <b>diphenylethers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Food chain {{accumulation}} of organochlorines and brominated flame retardants in estuarine and marine environments {{is compared to}} model estimations and fresh water field data. The food chain consists of herbivores, detritivores and primary and secondary carnivores i. e. fish, fish-eating birds and marine mammals. Accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls is predicted well by OMEGA for herbi-detritivores and primary and secondary carnivorous fish. Ratios {{are similar to those}} found for fresh water species. Accumulation ratios for fish-eating birds and mammals are overestimated by the model, which is attributed partly to biotransformation of metaÂ¿para unsubstituted congeners. Additionally, birds may feed in other less polluted areas. For <b>brominated</b> <b>diphenylethers</b> (BDE) accumulation patterns are highly species and congener specific. Accumulation depends on both Kow and metabolization capacities. BDE 47 is the predominant congener in lower trophic levels. For marine birds and mammals accumulation ratios of BDE 99 and 100 are similar to or higher than ratios of persistent PCB...|$|R

40|$|Capillary gas {{chromatography}} (GC) {{is a very}} useful technique for the determination of complex mixtures of halogenated contaminants. Initially, this technique has shown its merits for the determination of polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides. In addition, it has also broken new grounds towards the identification and quantification of relatively unknown halogenated compounds, often complex mixtures, such as toxaphene, polychlorinated naphthalenes and paraffins and brominated flame retardants. Capillary GC is, however, not the final solution for the determination of all these mixtures. For some of them, with a relatively simple constitution or {{with only a few}} major components, such as chlordanes and <b>brominated</b> <b>diphenylethers,</b> a reliable congener-specific analysis may be carried out by single-column capillary GC. For others more advanced techniques will be required. Multi-dimensional (MD) GC techniques, such as heart-cut MDGC or comprehensive MDGC, are still under development or have only been applied for non-routine analyses. Given the importance of some of these complex mixtures, such as several brominated flame retardants, which are still produced and used daily and world-wide, it may be expected that next to the use of GC-MS, these more advanced GC techniques will be used more frequently in the near future. The current state-of-the-art of capillary GC with regard to the different compounds classes indicated below is described. Also, attention is given to the sample preparation. The following groups of contaminants are being discussed: polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, chlorinated bornanes (toxaphene), chlordane, polychlorinated terphenyls, polychlorinated diphenylethers, polychlorinated naphthalenes, polychlorinated alkanes, polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenylethers.

40|$|Residues of polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs). {{extensively}} applied as flame retardants, {{are widely}} {{spread in the}} aquatic environment and biota. The present study investigates effects of the environmentally relevant lower <b>brominated</b> <b>diphenylethers</b> in two fish species in vivo under controlled laboratory conditions. Euryhaline flounder (Platichthys flesus) and freshwater zebrafish (Dunio rerio) were exposed {{to a range of}} concentrations of a commercial pentabromodiphenylether mixture, DE- 71. Chemical analysis of exposed fish showed a pattern of PBDE congeners that was very similar to that in wild fish. The resulting range included environmentally relevant, as well as higher levels. Animals were investigated histopathologically with emphasis on endocrine and reproductive organs. In zebrafish, hatching of embryos and larval development were assessed. Biochemical parameters were investigated in flounder as markers for Suggested dioxin-like activity (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase = EROD), and activation of endogenous estrogen synthesis (gonad aromatase activity). Thyroid hormones were analyzed in plasma in both species. Benchmark analysis using internal PBDE concentrations showed a mild dose-dependent decrease of hepatic EROD and ovarian aromatase activities, and plasma thyroxin levels in flounder, and an increase of plasma thyroid hormone levels in zebrafish. These trends did not result in statistically significant differences from control fish, and major histopathological changes were not observed. Reproduction in zebrafish appeared to be the most sensitive parameter with statistically significantly reduced larval survival and non-significant indications for decreased egg production at internal levels that were more than 55 times the highest environmental recordings. The present results indicate limited risk for endocrine or reproductive effects of current environmental PBDE contamination in fish...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an interlaboratory comparison (ILC) which focussed on the determination of total bromine, total sum of polybrominated biphenyls (PBB), total sum of polybrominated <b>diphenylethers</b> (PBDE), <b>brominated</b> <b>diphenylethers</b> (BDE- 47, BDE- 99, BDE- 183 and BDE- 209) and decabrominated biphenyl (BB- 209) in plastic. The test material used in this exercise was the Quality Control material (IRMM- 310) from the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) a poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) granulated that has been fortified with commercially available technical mixtures of polybrominated diphenylethers and polybrominated biphenyls. The material was relabelled to avoid its recognition. Twenty-five laboratories from 15 countries registered to the exercise, from which 23 reported results. The informative values provided by the IRMM- 310 material information sheet were taken as the assigned values and their associated uncertainties for all measurands. Studies to asses the adequacy of the selected test material regarding its homogeneity for all the selected measurands were undertaken Participants were invited to report the uncertainty of their measurements. Laboratory results were rated with z- and Î¶-scores (zeta-scores) in accordance with ISO 13528. The standard deviation for proficiency assessment was fixed to 25 % of the respective assigned value by the advisory board of this ILC. The outcome of the exercise was illustrating quite well the difficulties laboratories do have to provide consistent values for the investigated measurands; the share of satisfactory z-scores ranged between 61 and 88 %. There was a clear tendency to underestimate most of the measurands. The most influencing variables, leading to the observed variability and lack of trueness, were investigated. JRC. DG.

40|$|Organohalogen {{compounds}} such {{as certain}} organochlorinated Pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and <b>brominated</b> <b>diphenylethers</b> (PBDEs) are toxic and persistent {{and have been}} detected in various environmental compartments. All these compounds fall under or are candidate to the Stockholm Convention and {{they are subject to}} United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) monitoring programmes 1. In the past, different complex automated clean-up systems have been developed and dedicated to the analysis of dioxins in environmental samples. Later these methodologies have been adapted to include other conventional or emerging persistent organic compounds such as PCBs and PBDEs 2, 3, 4. These methodologies involve different types of adsorption media such as acidic silica/silica, alumina and active carbon and are useful if multiresidual analysis with PCDD/Fs analysis in a final step is applied. Often the monitoring of these chemicals do not include all these compounds, but is limited to only a few classes excluding the PCDD/Fs, so that a reduced number of clean up steps are needed and time and cost expenses reduced [...] In this study we tested the flexibility of an automated clean-up system used for the multiresidual analysis 5 developing a shorter and simpler automated method for the simultaneous analysis of PCBs and PBDEs in fish. For this purpose we reduced the clean up steps to GPC followed by acidic silica/silica columns. The automated clean up system (J 2 Scientific, Missouri, USA) consists of a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with autosampler (AccuPrep MPSTM), an evaporator system (AccuVapTM) and three solid phase module able to manage the acid silica/neutral silica, basic alumina and active carbon columns (Dioxin/SPE module) in-line. The system processes the samples in sequence. The system was tested with natural fish certified reference material EDF- 2525. JRC. DDG. H. 5 -Rural, water and ecosystem resource...|$|R
40|$|This Technical Guidance Document on Biota Monitoring (the Implementation of EQSbiota) aims to {{facilitate}} the implementation of environmental quality standards (EQS) in biota under the Water Framework Directive by addressing in particular the sampling strategies appropriate for monitoring programmes designed to assess compliance with biota EQS. It is Guidance Document No. 32 in the series of guidance documents prepared to support the Common Implementation Strategy (CIS) for the Water Framework Directive. It elaborates extensively {{on the content of}} Guidance Document No. 25 on Chemical Monitoring in Sediment and Biota under the Water Framework Directive, and is complemented by Guidance Document No. 33, the Technical Guidance Document on Analytical Methods for Biota Monitoring. Guidance Documents 32 and 33 together address the requirement for guidance on biota monitoring mentioned in Article 3 (8 a) of Directive 2008 / 105 /EC as amended by Directive 2013 / 39 /EU. The original Directive 2008 / 105 /EC included biota standards for mercury, hexachlorobenzene and hexachlorobutadiene. In Directive 2013 / 39 /EU, biota EQS were introduced for three other existing priority substances (fluoranthene, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and <b>brominated</b> <b>diphenylethers),</b> and set for four new priority substances (dicofol, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid and its derivatives, hexabromocyclododecane, and heptachlor/heptachlor epoxide). This guidance document takes into account the fact that trend monitoring in sediment and/or biota is required for several other priority substances as specified in Article 3 (6), and indicates how trend monitoring data can be used to check compliance with biota EQS, but does not elaborate on trend monitoring as such. This document constitutes guidance and Member States are therefore not legally required to follow the recommendations contained in it. Member States are, however, required to use methods compliant with the requirements of the Environmental Quality Standards Directive 2008 / 105 /EC and the Quality Assurance/Quality Control Directive 2009 / 90 /EC...|$|R
40|$|This report {{collects}} {{information on}} chemical analytical methods {{for the analysis}} of the new proposed priority substances (PS) of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and some existing PS for which the Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) have been changed under the first review of the PS list. First, analytical âstandardâ methods (ISO, CEN, US EPA) were searched. Then, the EU Member States (MS) were asked via the Chemical Monitoring and Emerging Pollutants (CMEP) expert group to provide validated âin-house methodsâ used as a national reference and to report their limits of detection (LODs) or quantification (LOQs). Finally, published literature articles were searched to get an overview of todayâs analytical performance. Compliance monitoring for the WFD requires the achievement of a LOQ equal or below a value of 30 % of the relevant EQS. The achieved method limits of quantification (LOQs) are therefore compared with 30 % of the EQS, which is 0. 3 Ã EQS. Very low annual average AA-EQS values in the picogram-per-liter (pg/l) concentration range have been set for several of the new proposed PS: For Cypermethrin 80 pg/l (8 pg/l for coastal salt waters), for Dichlorvos 60 pg/l in coastal waters, for Dicofol 32 pg/l in coastal waters, for 17 -alpha-ethinylestradiol 35 pg/l (7 pg/l in coastal waters), for 17 -beta-estradiol 80 pg/l in coastal waters, and for Heptachlor/-Heptachlorepoxide 0. 2 pg/l (10 fg/l in coastal waters). Dicofol and Heptachlor/-Heptachlorepoxide, for which biota EQS have been set (biota EQS: 33 Âµg/kg, and 6. 7 ng/kg, respectively), however, are intended to be analysed in biota. Moreover, a very challenging water EQS has been set for the already existing PS <b>Brominated</b> <b>Diphenylethers</b> (BDEs) (49 femtogram-per-liter (fg/l), and 2. 4 fg/l in coastal waters). However, it is intended that BDEs be analysed in biota (EQS: 8. 5 ng/kg). In addition, the water EQS for Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been lowered to 0. 17 ng/l, and a biota EQS of 2 - 10 Âµg/kg added, which is more easy to reach. In general, {{it is very difficult to}} reach with currently available analytical instruments LOQs in the low pg/l concentration range. A possibility could be the use of gas chromatography (GC) with high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). This technique, however, is not generally available in normal water monitoring laboratories. Also in the field of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), instruments with improved sensitivity have become available in the last years. Moreover, lower LOQs can be achieved by extracting higher volumes of water (10 - 1000 liters). These large-volume techniques, however, are very work and time intensive, and very costly, and are therefore not useful for routine WFD compliance monitoring (analysis of one sample per month). The most challenging substances proposed as new PS are: Cypermethrin (EQS: 80 pg/l, and 8 pg/l for coastal salt waters), Dichlorvos (EQS: 60 pg/l in coastal waters), 17 -alpha-ethinylestradiol (EQS: 35 pg/l, and 7 pg/l in coastal waters), and 17 -beta-estradiol (EQS: 0. 4 ng/l, and 80 pg/l in coastal waters). Dicofol, Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, Heptachlor/Heptachlorepoxide, Hexabromo-cyclododecane (HBCDD), Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), and the BDEs are intended to be analysed in biota. Minor analytical problems could be encountered for the following substances: Aclonifen (EQS: 0. 12 Âµg/l, and 12 ng/l for coastal salt waters), Bifenox (EQS: 12 ng/l, and 1. 2 ng/l for coastal waters), Cybutryne (=Irgarol) (EQS: 2. 5 ng/l), Diclofenac (EQS: 0. 10 Âµg/l, and 10 ng/l for coastal waters), Quinoxyfen (EQS: 0. 15 Âµg/l, and 15 ng/l for coastal waters), and Terbutryn (EQS: 65 ng/l, and 6. 5 ng/l for coastal waters).
