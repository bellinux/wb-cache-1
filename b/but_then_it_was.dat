25|$|Operation Yevusi lasted two weeks, from 22 April 1948 to 3 May 1948. Not all {{objectives}} were achieved before the British enforced a cease-fire. A Palmach force occupied the strategically located San Simon monastery in Katamon. Arab irregulars attacked the monastery {{and a heavy}} battle evolved. Both sides {{had a lot of}} wounded and killed fighters. The Palmach considered a retreat while the wounded fighters would blow themselves up, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> realized that the Arab force was exhausted and could not continue the fighting. As a result, the Arab residents left the suburb and the southern besieged Jewish suburbs were released.|$|E
25|$|Experienced miners from Northumberland and Wales were {{recruited}} for the digging and the British attack began on 17 April 1915. The hill was captured quickly with only seven casualties <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{found that the}} salient which had been created, made occupation of the hill very costly. Both sides mistakenly accused the other of using poison gas in the April fighting; German attacks on the hill in early May included the use of gas shells and the Germans recovered {{the ground at the}} second attempt on 5 May. It remained in German hands until the Battle of Messines in 1917, when two of the Mines in the Battle of Messines were detonated beneath Hill 60 and the Caterpillar.|$|E

The standup interstitials for this episode were recorded twice.

The scene that was set in the bank was originally set in a dry cleaner's. However, this was moved and some of the material was moved to a later episode called [...] "The Stock Tip".|$|E
500|$|Diocletian met Maximian in Milan in {{the winter}} of 290–91, either in late December 290 or January 291. The meeting was {{undertaken}} with a sense of solemn pageantry. The emperors spent most of their time in public appearances. It has been surmised that the ceremonies were arranged to demonstrate Diocletian's continuing support for his faltering colleague. A deputation from the Roman Senate met with the emperors, renewing its infrequent contact with the Imperial office. The choice of Milan over Rome further snubbed the capital's pride. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> already a long established practice that Rome itself was only a ceremonial capital, as the actual seat of the Imperial administration was determined by the needs of defense. Long before Diocletian, Gallienus (r. 253–68) had chosen Milan as the seat of his headquarters. If the panegyric detailing the ceremony implied that the true center of the empire was not Rome, but where the emperor sat ("...the capital of the empire appeared to be there, where the two emperors met"), it simply echoed what had already been stated by the historian Herodian in the early third century: [...] "Rome is where the emperor is". During the meeting, decisions on matters of politics and war were probably made in secret. The Augusti would not meet again until 303.|$|E

2500|$|Croatian police {{violence}} {{has been used}} to intimidate refugees travelling from Serbia into Croatia. This has included segregation of nationalities, with Syrian, Iraqi and Afghani nationals gaining entry to Croatia as refugees much more easily than other nationalities. An unaccompanied sixteen-year-old from Morocco recounted his experience in attempting to gain asylum in Croatia after lying about being a Syrian national: [...] "We had to get into a police car…They told us this is Slovenia, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Serbia…One of my friends tried to run away, but the Croatian police caught [...] him and beat him." [...] Police beatings are illustrative of the systemic discriminatory violence that exists within the Croatian police force.|$|E

It’s a party, but there’s something darker there as well". Inspired by the exposing nature of film, Whedon decided to infuse a recurring motif of sexuality, [...] "...because it’s a visual medium. You can say it or you can show it. [...] There’s an element to it, of debauchery, that was fun for a time <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just sort of dark".

2500|$|As Pu Tong Seal was a ruler {{for nine}} {{administered}} units under his province, every family from each unit supposed {{to deliver a}} certain amount of grain or crop from the yearly yielding and harvesting. Pu Tong Seal increased the size of a food storage unit known as “Beam” by sitting inside during the construction, and having it built as tall as he was, because of dissatisfaction with the previous size. His subjects from a particular administered unit (part of the province) believed that this “Beam” was too large for them to use as a measurement for collecting crops from each household of the surrounding villages, so they made a secret plan. They arranged a big feast in honor of Pu Tong Seal with many delicacies. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a little too late for him to enjoy the festivity as he started feeling nausea and abdominal cramps due to food poisoning.

[...] While Faizan Javed from The Nation reportedly said [...] "The opening ceremony was attended by special guests and people from the theatre and performing arts such as Salima Hashmi, Bina Jawaad and Information, Culture and Youth Affairs Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman as honorable chief guest." [...] Salima Hashmi in an interview with The Nation in regards to the festivity said, “When I first performed in Alhamra there was no fancy set, props and sound system.

2500|$|In 1935 Huxley was {{appointed}} secretary to the Zoological Society of London, and {{spent much of}} the next seven years running the society and its zoological gardens, the London Zoo and Whipsnade Park, alongside his writing and research. The previous Director, Peter Chalmers Mitchell, had been in post for many years, and had skillfully avoided conflict with the Fellows and Council. Things were rather different when Huxley arrived. Huxley was not a skilled administrator; his wife said [...] "He was impatient… and lacked tact". He instituted a number of changes and innovations, more than some approved of. For example, Huxley introduced a whole range of ideas designed to make the Zoo child-friendly. Today, this would pass without comment; <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> more controversial. He fenced off the Fellows' Lawn to establish Pets Corner; he appointed new assistant curators, encouraging them to talk to children; he initiated the Zoo Magazine. Fellows and their guests had the privilege of free entry on Sundays, a closed day to the general public. Today, that would be unthinkable, and Sundays are now open to the public. Huxley's mild suggestion (that the guests should pay) encroached on territory the Fellows thought was theirs by right.|$|E
2500|$|The horse-drawn tramway, {{running on}} a track flush with the street, had been {{introduced}} in New York in 1832. A French engineer living in New York, Loubat, brought the idea to Paris and opened the first tramway line in Paris, between the Place de la Concorde and the Barrière de Passy in November 1853. He extended the line, known as the Chemin de fer américain ("American rail line"), {{all the way across}} Paris from Boulogne to Vincennes in 1856. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> purchased by the CGO, the main omnibus line, and remained simply a curiosity. Only in 1873 did the tramway begin to gain importance, when the CGO lost its monopoly on city transport and two new companies, Tramways Nord and Tramways Sud, one financed by Belgian banks and the other by British banks, began operating from the center of Paris to the suburbs. [...] The CGO responded by opening two new lines, one from the Louvre to Vincennes, the other following the line of fortifications around the city. By 1878, forty different lines were operating, half by the CGO. The companies tried a brief experiment with steam-powered tramways in 1876, but abandoned them in 1878. The electric-powered tramway, in service in Berlin since 1881, did not arrive in Paris until 1898, with a line from Saint-Denis to the Madeleine.|$|E

He has to become the beast of the Apocalypse to be able to defend humanity, but at the same time he becomes a much darker being. It's a very interesting ending to the series, but I don't think it will happen. ... We have gone through basically every studio and asked for financing, and they are not interested.
