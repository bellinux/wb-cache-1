Their role is primarily linked to being on a protest committee which is a panel of judges. In sailing, unlike many sports, due to the practical considerations involved (being on the water), umpiring (refereeing) is not very common. In the event of competitors {{not being able to}} resolve <b>issues</b> afloat, then <b>a</b> competitor or race committee may <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> in front of a protest committee for their consideration.

50|$|The {{military}} justice system commonly uses four writs: mandamus, prohibition, error coram nobis, and habeas corpus. A writ of mandamus is {{an order from}} a {{court of competent jurisdiction}} that requires the performance of a specified act by an inferior court or authority. The writ of prohibition is used to prevent the commission of a specified act or issuance of a particular order. The writ of error coram nobis is used to <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> before the court that previously decided the same issue. It allows the court to review error of fact or a retroactive change in the law that which affects the validity of the prior proceeding. The writ of habeas corpus is used to challenge either the legal basis for or the manner of confinement.|$|R

This form of documentary filmmaking, Filming for Change, has been employed successfully and unsuccessfully by many different filmmakers. There are a few keys to making a successful documentary when Filming for Change, and {{the first is to}} appeal to the correct demographic. Those who have the political power to influence policy will tend to be white, male, and between 35 and 64 years of age. These people do not like propaganda or a slanted film. They prefer a slower, more methodical and thoughtful approach that doesn’t rely on quick, jumpy edits. They prefer a feeling of intimacy with the subjects, and tend to be more emotionally connected if they can relate to the subjects’ experiences. But the subjects’ experiences must also be tied to a broader picture and be used in connection with factual data. Using these key points, documentary filmmakers can Film for Change and frame policy debates over any issue that the filmmaker feels isn’t adequately addressed...|$|R

The court conducts {{mandatory}} review (unless waived by the appellant) of all courts-martial {{of members of the}} naval service referred to the court pursuant to Articles 62, 66, 69, and 73 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. When necessary in furtherance of its jurisdiction, the Court reviews all petitions for extraordinary relief properly filed before it (28 U.S.C. § 1651). The United States military justice system commonly uses four writs: mandamus, prohibition, error coram nobis, and habeas corpus. A writ of mandamus is an order from a court of competent jurisdiction that requires the performance of a specified act by an inferior court or authority. The writ of prohibition is used to prevent the commission of a specified act or issuance of a particular order.

5000|$|The early {{origins of}} Brazilian civil {{procedure}} {{can be found}} in the Portuguese Philippine Ordinances (Ordenações Filipinas), which were prepared during the reign of Philip I of Portugal in 1595, but not promulgated until the reign of Philip II in 1603. These ordinances were applied to Colonial Brazil and continued to be in force in the country after its independence from Portugal in 1822. Book III of the Ordinances contained basic rules for <b>bringing</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> before <b>a</b> court, such as requiring the complaint to be written and authorizing [...] "secret acts" [...] where both the plaintiff and defendant were barred from participating (parties did not participate in the examination of witnesses, for example). These procedures were heavily influenced by Roman and canon law, signaling Brazil´s long-standing preference for civil law systems. The Philippine Ordinances remained valid in Brazil for centuries, and even with the publishing of the 1850 Commercial Code, civil cases continued to follow the rules of procedure delineated by the ordinances. With the 1891 Constitution, states were authorized to create their own rules for civil procedure. Most continued to embrace the Roman influences of the previous system. Most states also failed to properly revitalize and modernize the process. This failure influenced the 1934 Constitution to grant authority over the civil procedure to the Brazilian Federal Government.|$|R

30|$|To {{address the}} lack of specific-sectoral data, proxies {{that can be used}} to {{integrate}} the values of circular strategies into the EEIOA framework could be estimated. For instance, to identify the patterns of industrial waste disposal, Reynolds et al. (2016 b) suggested that the shares of waste generation in New Zealand presented the same trend as others developed economies (e.g. UK and Australia) and, then, used a proxy for the estimation of waste generation. In many cases, this type of assumption introduces uncertainties that may affect the analysis reliability (Ohno et al. 2016). Although the importance of uncertainties is considered in the literature (Wiedmann 2009), most of the reviewed studies mention the level of uncertainty without addressing it in much detail, and it <b>brings</b> <b>a</b> recurrent <b>issue</b> about data reliability of analysing circular economy interventions with EEIOA.|$|R
