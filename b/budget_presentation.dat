However, his administration imposed one-day-a-month furloughs for all non-uniformed employees from July through December 2010, as well as 2% pay cuts for managers and directors earning more than $100,000 a year. In 2008 and 2009 the City of Newark received the Government Finance Officers Association's Distinguished <b>Budget</b> <b>Presentation</b> Award. In an effort to make government more accessible, Booker held regular open office hours during which city residents can meet with him personally to discuss their concerns.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore and analyze {{recession}} rhetoric - the ways in which the leading force of economic and fiscal policy in Finland, the Minister of Finance, addresses his audiences during a global financial crisis. The material consists of five <b>budget</b> <b>presentations,</b> held in the period of 2007 to 2009 in front of the Finnish Parliament and the Finnish Economic Association. These presentations are seen as persuasive speeches, where the combination of contextual factors and argumentation comprise their rhetorical power. The theoretical framework is found in the rhetorical tradition within communication, as well as in argumentation analysis. The contextual factors of the <b>budget</b> <b>presentations</b> are analyzed with the help of Lloyd Bitzer's situational view on rhetoric. They include the constraints, exigence and audience present in the situation. In addition, the role of the rhetor is explored. Another guiding theory is Chaïm Perelman's argumentation theory, which is used in order to explain the role of the audience, the underlying premises guiding the argumentation and the used argumentation techniques. The rhetor of the <b>budget</b> <b>presentations</b> is the Minister of Finance, Mr Jyrki Katainen, representing two institutions, the ministry and the government. The rhetor wishes to strengthen the ethos of his institutions and relies on argumentation from authority. The constraints are connected to the forum: the rules and regulations of the parliamentary plenary sessions and the traditions of the Economic Association do not only guide the time and place for the presentations but also set the outline for their structure, language and thematic choices. The controlling exigence is the ongoing global financial crisis. The current crisis is dissociated from the previous economic downfall in Finland, the depression of 1990 's. There are multiple particular audiences which the <b>budget</b> <b>presentations</b> address. The rhetor needs to convince the members of the parliament, both from the governmental and opposition parties, to support the budget proposal. Approval from economic experts and citizens is needed, so that trust, a necessary component of economic activity, will remain in the society. The attention of the media is required in order to pass the word to the wider public. The language of the presentations is not overtly colourful, but some vivid expressions and metaphors are used. In addition to the particular audiences, the speaker has constructed a universal audience, an idea of the Finnish society, whose values and beliefs work as a guideline for the argumentation. Pathos amongst the audience and identification with the rhetor is awoken with the help of excessive yet ambiguous use of the pronoun ‘we'. It is also used in order to stress the universality of the arguments. The rhetoric also relies on logos, the seemingly logical economic facts, figures and calculations which are even used in a ritualistic fashion. The cultural aspects of Finland, stressing homogeneity and consensus, work as a reaffirmation to the reasonableness of the argumentation and leave less room for alternative views. A major trend in political communication, mediatization, is also visible. The speeches reveal the struggle for the domination of the centre in Finnish politics. The presentations utilize the causal relationships found in macroeconomic theories and the perceived long line of Finnish economic policy, together with the belief in the Nordic welfare state. A close connection is drawn between economic growth and welfare, and people are most of all seen as economic creatures or objects for decision-making. The <b>budget</b> <b>presentations</b> reflect the movement of economic policy rhetoric away from the logic of politics, towards not only the logic of media, but also increasingly the logic of economic realities and necessity rhetoric.

30|$|For {{the cities}} with {{evidence}} of a living wage law, we obtained as much possible information from 1995 through 2010 from the city website or directly through a city representative. Using the city website, we reviewed the current living wage law found in the city’s municipal code or code of ordinances which, at times, contained {{a reference to the}} ordinance creating the code. 26 The documents reviewed in the search typically generated information on the living wage history (e.g., council agendas/minutes, <b>budget</b> <b>presentations,</b> or living wage ordinance summaries), or reference forms containing the living wage rates (e.g., posters, memoranda, or living wage rate change bulletins), from which we gained additional detail. Once we established the broad picture, we used specific dates to track down the actual ordinances adopted and the living wage rates established during a given year. If necessary, we contacted city representatives by telephone or email to confirm findings or provide information that was not attainable from the city web pages.|$|R

About $ 3. 8 billion of this amount has been set aside for compact assistance. As of January 2006, MCC had signed or approved eight compacts obligating about $ 1. 5 billion, leaving an unobligated balance of about $ 2. 3 billion. To assist in this year's budget deliberations, this letter provides a range of estimates under two scenarios of how quickly MCC could obligate this balance and three possible levels of FY 2007 appropriations at the current pace of compact award. The President has requested an additional $ 3 billion for MCC for FY 2007. To address this objective, we analyzed MCC's FY 2005 and 2006 <b>budget</b> <b>presentations</b> and other corporation records.
