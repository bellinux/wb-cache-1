40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [112]- 114) The {{control hierarchy}} of a {{flexible manufacturing system}} {{is often used to}} reduce the complexity by dividing the control structure into several levels such as the shop, the cell, and the equipment. Among these levels the cell level plays an important role since it contains various hardware and control elements that can produce a family of parts independently {{of the rest of the}} manufacturing facility. Therefore, a model that can efficiently represent the cell control operation is essential. A Petri-net model is designed to perform cell control functions for a flexible manufacturing cell. The Petri- net model consists of multiple nets that can integrate major cell control functions such as scheduling, monitoring, error-handling, and tool management. The model can accommodate different job types, the preferred and alternative product routes, and the random <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources.</b> The concepts of the colored, and the timed Petri-nets as well as the inhibitor arcs are used for the model. The Petri-net model is validated using the reachability tree and the incidence matrix techniques. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E
40|$|Most {{recent studies}} on the {{long-term}} supply of uranium make simplistic assumptions on the available resources and their production costs. Some consider the whole uranium quantities in the Earth's crust and then estimate the production costs based on the ore grade only, disregarding the size of ore bodies and the mining techniques. Other studies consider the resources reported by countries for a given cost category, disregarding undiscovered or unreported quantities. In both cases, the resource estimations are sorted following a cost merit order. In this paper, we describe a methodology based on “geological environments”. It provides a more detailed resource estimation and it is more flexible regarding cost modelling. The global uranium resource estimation introduced in this paper results from the sum of independent resource estimations from different geological environments. A geological environment is defined by its own geographical boundaries, resource dispersion (average grade and size of ore bodies and their variance), and cost function. With this definition, uranium resources are considered within ore bodies. The deposit <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> is modelled using a bivariate statistical approach where size and grade are the two random variables. This makes resource estimates possible for individual projects. Adding up all geological environments provides a repartition of all Earth's crust resources in which ore bodies are sorted by size and grade. This subset-based estimation is convenient to model specific cost structures...|$|E

40|$|Reproduction in butterflies, {{as in many}} {{holometabolous}} insects, {{is usually}} constrained {{by the amount of}} nutrients the animals can collect as juveniles. In polyandric species the females can also supplement their larval-derived reserves with protein-rich donations, so-called nuptial gifts, delivered by the males at mating. Recent findings also indicate that females have access to nitrogen from the histolysis of flight muscles in the thorax. This field study examined how butterflies of the polyandric gift-giving species Pieris napi (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) use body resources in their reproduction and how the male donations affect the females use of stored reserves. The results support earlier studies, indicating that females use <b>resources</b> from the <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> thorax muscles to increase their reproductive potential and the results also indicate that males also use thorax material in their reproduction.

40|$|There is an ever {{increasing}} need of providing quick, yet improved solution to dynamic scheduling by better responsiveness following simple coordination mechanism to better {{adapt to the}} changing environments. In this endeavor, a cognitive agent based approach is proposed to deal with machine failure. A Multi Agent based Holonic Adaptive Scheduling (MAHoAS) architecture is developed to frame the schedule by explicit communication between the product holons and the resource holons {{in association with the}} integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS) holon under normal situation. In the event <b>of</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> a <b>resource,</b> the cooperation is sought by implicit communication. Inspired by the cognitive behavior of human being, a cognitive decision making scheme is proposed that reallocates the incomplete task to another resource in the most optimized manner and tries to expedite the processing in view of machine failure. A metamorphic algorithm is developed and implemented in Oracle 9 i to identify the best candidate resource for task re-allocation. Integrated approach to process planning and scheduling realized under Multi Agent System (MAS) framework facilitates dynamic scheduling with improved performance under such situations. The responsiveness <b>of</b> the <b>resources</b> having cognitive capabilities helps to overcome the adverse consequences <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> failure in a better way...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Building contractors are unhappy about the existing post-tender use of the bills of quantities, particularly {{the way in which}} data produced by the estimator may be independently produced again or amended to a suitable format by other management functions. This research aimed at proposing better formats and presentations for the estimating data {{in order to reduce the}} repetition and re-work involved in the post-tender use of estimating data, hence to reduce the complexities in data flow in building contractor organizations. The work was primarily carried out for the Sri Lankan industry. To establish the scale and nature of the problem, past work on the format and presentation of estimating data and its current management was studied through literature, interviews and discussions with professionals in ten case studies. Proposals were formulated defining; an efficient classification and coding system, a well defined library structure, a new format to the contractor's copy of the estimate, and effective uses of the computer. The main proposal was to split the unit rate into its components and to provide a <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> requirements for each bill item. The documents prepared in two test projects were used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposals in the earlier case studies, and feedback was obtained on the use and extent of use of the improved estimate in post-tender works. A live project was undertaken to investigate the practicability of implementing of the proposals. Finally, an independent survey, without disclosing the results derived from test projects, case studies and the live project was carried out to assess the acceptability of the proposals in the whole industry. All practical work was undertaken in Sri Lanka. The main conclusions derived from these works are; Any research that would investigate the contractor's efficient post-tender use of estimates hould be addressed to contractor organisations; and any proposal that would improve the contractor's data management should be based on contractor's presentation of the estimate. Although the contractors widely use the estimate in their management functions, the full potential is not obtained throughout the contract. Substantial re-work exists in the use of estimate in contractor's post-tender works. The average extent of use of the estimating data was measured at 50...|$|R

40|$|For {{managing}} highway bridges, stakeholders require {{efficient and}} practical decision making techniques. In {{a context of}} limited bridge management budget, {{it is crucial to}} determine the most effective <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>resources</b> over the different structures of a bridge network. Bridge management systems (BMSs) have been developed for such a purpose. However, they generally rely on an individual approach. The influence of the position of bridges in the transportation network, the consequences of inadequate service for the network users, due to maintenance actions or bridge failure, are not taken into consideration. Therefore, maintenance strategies obtained with current BMSs do not necessarily lead to an optimal level of service (LOS) of the bridge network for the users of the transportation network. Besides, the assessment of the structural performance of highway bridges usually requires the access to the geometrical and mechanical properties of its components. Such information might not be available for all structures in a bridge network for which managers try to schedule and prioritize maintenance strategies. On the contrary, visual inspections are performed regularly and information is generally available for all structures of the bridge network. The objective of this paper is threefold (1) propose an advanced network-level bridge management system considering the position of each bridge in the transportation network, (2) use information obtained at visual inspections to assess the performance of bridges, and (iii) compare optimal maintenance strategies, obtained with a genetic algorithm, when considering interests of users and bridge owner either separately as conflicting criteria, or simultaneously as a common interest for the whole community. In each case, safety and serviceability aspects are taken into account in the model when determining optimal strategies. The theoretical and numerical developments are applied on a French bridge network...|$|R

30|$|In {{dioecious}} plants, {{the presence}} of rare hermaphroditic morphs including monoecious and polygamous plants, which is known as subdioecy, has been reported (Dorken and Barrett, 2004). The occurrence of rare hermaphrodites in subdioecious populations {{is thought to be}} the final transition from either gynodioecy or androdioecy toward dioecy, the initial <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> established dioecy or a mere developmental noise. On the other hand, stable subdioecy potentially has adaptive significance in relation to variation in abiotic and biotic environments including the availability <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and mates (Dorken and Barrett, 2004). In willows, hermaphroditic plants and populations have been found in some species but are exceptional in this genus with strict dioecy (Smith, 1940; Rohwer and Kubitzki, 1984; Falinski, 1998; Rottenberg, 2007). Thus, exceptional hermaphrodites in willows are likely to originate from the initial <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> the dioecious system or developmental instability in sex expression.|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to elucidate the biophysical mechanism <b>of</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation, which at present is unknown. Results A model of a space-clamped motor nerve fiber was developed. It was found that this new model could reproduce <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation when it included a low-threshold, rapidly activating, persistent sodium current. However, the phenomenon was not reproduced when the persistent sodium current did not have fast activation kinetics or a low activation threshold. Conclusion The present modeling study suggests that persistent, low-threshold, rapidly activating sodium currents have a key role in <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation, and that <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation can be used as a tool for studying persistent sodium current under normal and pathological conditions. </p...|$|R
