I asked him why he did this, but he answered impatiently, because he wished it, so I left him alone. I could see, indeed, that he was in a strange and irritable mood, for the failure of our search oppressed him. Moreover, we knew, both of us, that it could not be much prolonged, since the weather might <b>break</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>moment,</b> when ascents of the mountain would become impossible.|$|E
50|$|Crooked {{political}} boss Paul Madvig (Brian Donlevy) {{is determined}} to back reform candidate Ralph Henry (Moroni Olsen) for governor after {{falling in love with}} Henry's daughter, Janet (Veronica Lake). Madvig's right-hand man, Ed Beaumont (Alan Ladd), believes the move is a big mistake and rightly distrusts Janet's motives. She is only playing along at her father's request; she is put off by Madvig's crudity and becomes very attracted to the more eclectic Beaumont. He fends off her advances out of strong loyalty to his friend. The deluded Madvig boasts that Henry has practically given him the key to his house; Beaumont warns him that it is liable to be a glass key, one that can <b>break</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E

Bonnet told Phipps: [...] "I repeated all this with emotion to Sir Eric Phipps telling him that at no price should we allow ourselves to be involved in war without having weighted all the consequences and without having measured in particular the state of our military forces". On September 14, Bonnet told Phipps: [...] "We cannot sacrifice ten million men in order to prevent three and half million Sudetens joining the Reich".|$|R
60|$|Before long, tidings {{of these}} {{wonderful}} young men reached the palace, {{where the old}} King now lay ill, and the Queen lived in fear of her life, for the people hated her and might <b>break</b> out <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>moment.</b> She sent for the Brothers; and they came at once, hoping to do some good. Nobody recognized the pretty Princes in the tall young monks, half hidden in their hoods and gowns; but comfort and courage seemed to come with them, for the sick King grew stronger when they prayed or sang beside him, and the sad Queen took heart, and confessed her sins to them, begging them {{to tell her what}} to do, since selfish splendor brought neither happiness, love, nor honor.|$|R
60|$|A bitter {{wind was}} blowing when Wyllard stood outside the little tent the morning after {{he had made a}} landing on the ice.

40|$|We explain simple semi-classical {{rules to}} {{estimate}} the lifetime of any given highlyexcited quantum state of the string spectrum in flat spacetime. We discuss both the decays by splitting into two massive states and by massless emission. As an application, we study a solution describing a rotating and pulsating ellipse which becomes folded at an instant of time – the “squashing ellipse”. This string interpolates between the folded string with maximum angular momentum and the pulsating circular string. We explicitly compute the quantum decay rate for the corresponding quantum state, and verify the basic rules that we propose. Finally, we give a more general (4 -parameter) family of closed string solutions representing rotating and pulsating elliptical strings. 1 1 Decay rate due to breaking In general, a string can decay either by emitting light particles or by splitting into two massive strings. Which channel is dominant depends on the string state and {{on the number of}} uncompact dimensions. In the situation of splitting into two massive strings with masses much greater than l− 1 s, the two outgoing strings are highly excited string states which admit a classical description. The decay rate in this case can be estimated by semiclassical arguments. In this section we will discuss the different situations in detail and give an estimate of the decay rate due to breaking in each case. 1. 1 Open strings The probability of breaking for an open string was studied in [1]. There it was suggested that it is constant along the string and proportional to g 2 o. We propose that, more precisely, the probability of breaking on a given point once in a period is Po = g 2 o T, (1. 1) where T is the period of oscillations of the string (so the probability of <b>breaking</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>moment</b> is TPo = g 2 o in agreement with [1]). τ, we have In the gauge X 0 =...|$|R

However irregular the motion might be, it was sure, if continued, to bring him to land in time, and that was all he cared about just then.|$|R

5000|$|The attack {{took place}} before any formal {{declaration}} of war was made by Japan, {{but this was not}} Admiral Yamamoto's intention. He originally stipulated that the attack should not commence until thirty minutes after Japan had informed the United States that peace negotiations were at an end. However, the attack began before the notice could be delivered. Tokyo transmitted the 5000-word notification (commonly called the [...] "14-Part Message") in two blocks to the Japanese Embassy in Washington, but transcribing the message took too long for the Japanese ambassador to deliver it in time. (In fact, U.S. code breakers had already deciphered and translated most of the message hours before he was scheduled to deliver it.) The final part of the [...] "14 Part Message" [...] is sometimes described as a {{declaration of war}}. While it was viewed by a number of senior U.S government and military officials as a very strong indicator that negotiations were likely to be terminated and that war might <b>break</b> out <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>moment,</b> it neither declared war nor severed diplomatic relations. A declaration of war was printed {{on the front page of}} Japan's newspapers in the evening edition of December 8, but not delivered to the U.S. government until the day after the attack.|$|R
60|$|He dropped {{upon the}} timber, {{and the gap}} he splashed into closed up {{suddenly}} as he whipped out his leg. Then, with Brooke behind him, he crawled over the grinding logs, and by and by drove {{the point of the}} auger into one that seemed to run downwards through the midst of them. It was a good many feet in girth, and Brooke gasped heavily when he also laid hold of the auger crutch. The hole they made was charged with one of the yellow rolls, and, moving to a second log, they bored another, while the mass shook and trembled under them, and twice a great spout of water fell splashing upon them. The logs were apparently endued with vitality, for they moved under and over their fellows, and ground upon them with the pulsations of the stream that brought down fresh accessions and found a fresh channel that promptly closed again. The jam might resist the pressure for another week, or <b>break</b> up <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>moment,</b> and whirl down the gully in chaotic ruin. Still, with the rain beating down upon them, the pair toiled on until several sticks of explosive had been embedded, when Brooke rose very stiffly and straightened himself as he took a little case out of his pocket.|$|R

5000|$|On 19 February, a new {{agreement}} was announced between Arab rebels and YPG fighters in Ras al-Ayn following a weeklong truce. The {{terms of the}} agreement stipulated the withdrawal of all foreign fighters from the town, the establishment of joint FSA-YPG checkpoints which will allow for greater freedom of movement {{in and out of the}} town, the creation of a democratic local council tasked with the administration of the town and its border crossing, the planned future establishment of a cooperative Arab-Kurdish police force in the town, and—most significantly—the cooperation between the YPG and FSA to fight together against government forces in the region. In its signing the agreement, the FSA acted on behalf of all Arab rebel groups in the area except for Jabhat al-Nusra and Ghuraba al-Sham, who agreed separately to abide by the agreement. Michel Kilo stated that most of the fighters from both sides withdrew in a timely fashion. Nevertheless, some activists remained dismissive of the strength of the agreement, expressing doubts over the willingness of Islamists—particularly Ghuraba al-Sham—to respect Kurdish rights in the region. One Kurdish activist stated, [...] "Either side can <b>break</b> the agreement <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>moment</b> ... The FSA military council is not strong in the area, and its leadership has made contradicting statements in the past. From my point of view, this accord is empty." ...|$|R
