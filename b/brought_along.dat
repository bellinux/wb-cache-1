5|$|After a final {{check of}} the weather reports for Germany and the North Sea, Hess took off at 17:45 on 10 May 1941 from the {{airfield}} at Augsburg-Haunstetten in his specially prepared aircraft. It was the last of several attempts to depart on his mission; previous efforts had to be called off due to mechanical problems or poor weather. Wearing a leather flying suit bearing the rank of captain, he <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> a supply of money and toiletries, a torch, a camera, maps and charts, and a collection of 28 different medicines, as well as dextrose tablets to help ward off fatigue and an assortment of homeopathic remedies.|$|E

5|$|As the Great Depression {{resulted}} in massive {{unemployment in the}} late 1920s and 1930s, more Japanese and Okinawans migrated to Palau. Immigrants <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> their families and sought employment in various professions. The Japanese immigrants held administrative posts, while the Okinawans and a few Koreans worked as labourers in the agricultural, fishery and mining industries. By 1935, the Japanese constituted at least 60% of Palau's population and were concentrated in urban areas such as Angaur and Koror. Some Japanese settlers took Palauan wives or mistresses, {{and there was a}} sizeable minority of mixed Japanese-Palauan children towards the later years of the Japanese administration.|$|E
5|$|Barnes <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> half a tonne {{of baggage}} {{on the sea}} voyage to England, {{including}} {{a lot of food}} and drink, particularly alcohol, which was scarce due to the war and subject to rationing. There Barnes would sell his goods. During the journey, the players had to sign autographs on 5,000 sheets of paper with the team list. Barnes had a stamp of his signature made, and paid a young boy drinks to deal with the sheets, but he landed himself in trouble with captain Don Bradman and manager Keith Johnson when the boy stamped the sheets erratically, sometimes not adjacent to Barnes's position on the team list.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, McGown {{staged a}} billiards {{exhibition}} at New York City's Grand Central Terminal. With her parents' permission, he <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> the 6-year-old Balukas, where she {{participated in the}} spectacle. The attention this generated, coupled with her prodigious talent, landed her a guest appearance in 1966 on WNEW-TV's Wonderama. Later that year, Balukas, along with her younger sister Laura, appeared on CBS's popular show I've Got a Secret. None of the panelists were successful in guessing that the 7- and 5-year-old sisters were pool enthusiasts.|$|E

500|$|As she aged, her {{behavior}} improved, {{and she began}} to behave like a seasoned veteran. [...] Mandella gave credit to the horse: [...] "I’d say she <b>brought</b> me <b>along.</b> I haven‘t <b>brought</b> her <b>along.</b> I’ve just been along for the ride." [...] By her six-year-old season, following her 17th career win, which was also her sixth consecutive victory, [...] Mandella said of Beholder, [...] " [...] "Good horses come along, and there are a few great ones, but to be great and stay great, it really is special." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Lee learned that Venerable Tao Chiai wanted {{to restore a}} {{dilapidated}} Chinese temple in Sarnath (the deer park where the Buddha gave his first sermon after his enlightenment) that a Chinese emperor of the Tang Dynasty built in the 8th century AD. Venerable Tao Chiai died before he could accomplish this task; however, his chief disciple, Venerable Teh Yue, continued the restoration project, which Lee personally funded. Lee went {{on a pilgrimage to}} India with Venerable Teh Yue and <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> an English engineer, A. H. King, to assess and assist the restoration works. This temple still stands today in Sarnath and is called simply The Chinese Temple in Sarnath.|$|E
5|$|Public {{dissatisfaction with}} the newly-issued Morgan dollar led the Mint's {{engravers}} to submit designs for the smaller silver coins in 1879. Among those who called for new coinage was editor Richard Watson Gilder of The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. Sometime in the early 1880s, he, along {{with one of his}} reporters and sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens visited Mint Director Burchard to argue for the creation of new designs. They <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> classic Greek and Roman coins in an attempt to persuade Burchard that the coinage could easily be made more beautiful. The visitors left disappointed, after learning that Burchard considered the much-criticized Morgan dollar as beautiful as any of them.|$|E
5|$|Speaker's Corner became {{increasingly}} {{popular in the}} late 19th century. Visitors <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> placards, stepladders and soap boxes in order to stand out from others, while heckling of speakers was popular. Donald Soper, Baron Soper was a regular visitor throughout the 20th century, until just {{before his death in}} 1998. The rise of the Internet, particularly blogs, has diminished the importance of Speaker's Corner as a political platform, and it is increasingly seen as simply a tourist attraction.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{these two}} {{connections}} are made, {{we can no}} longer define whether a given particle is matter or antimatter. A particle might appear as an electron when viewed along one route, and as a positron when viewed along the other. If we define a reference charge as nominally positive and bring it alongside our [...] "undefined charge" [...] particle, the two particles may attract if <b>brought</b> together <b>along</b> one route, and repel if <b>brought</b> together <b>along</b> another - the Alice universe loses the ability to distinguish between positive and negative charges, except locally.|$|R
50|$|A steam {{locomotive}} {{with two or}} three carriages <b>brought</b> passengers <b>along</b> the branch line from Razdelnaya station. A passenger ferry from Lisy Nos to Kronstadt connected with the trains.|$|R

5|$|The {{first two}} days of the Flamingo {{engagement}} went by smoothly. On July 1, when reporting for makeup and wardrobe before their first show of the evening, Ballard discovered an extra set of gowns and costumes that had been <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> for Cindy Birdsong. Angered, Ballard performed the first concert of the night inebriated, leading to an embarrassing on-stage incident in which her stomach was revealed when she purposely thrust it forward during a dance routine. Enraged, Gordy ordered her back to Detroit and permanently dismissed her from the group. Birdsong officially assumed her place during the second July 1 show.|$|E
5|$|As {{the relief}} army {{approached}} Tyana, it {{was confronted by}} the Arabs, and in the ensuing battle, the Byzantines were routed. According to Theophanes, the two Byzantine generals quarrelled among themselves, and their attack was disorderly. The Byzantines lost many thousand dead, and the captives also numbered in the thousands. The Arabs captured the Byzantine camp and took all the provisions they had <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> for the beleaguered city, allowing them to continue the siege. The inhabitants of Tyana now despaired of any succour, and as their own supplies dwindled they began negotiations for a surrender. The Arabs promised {{to allow them to}} depart unharmed, and the city capitulated after a siege of nine months (in March according to Michael the Syrian, in May–June according to al-Tabari). Theophanes reports that the Arabs broke their promise and enslaved the entire population, which was deported to the Caliphate, but no other source confirms this. After looting the town, the Arabs razed it to the ground.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} May 1457, a large Ottoman {{army was}} seen {{approaching}} Albania. Skanderbeg {{sent a letter to}} Calixtus informing him of the Ottoman arrival and the dire need for military aid. The pope responded with a promise to send a fleet to Albania – even though the enemy was on land – but it did not arrive. Skanderbeg was thus left to fight the oncoming Ottoman army alone. Mehmed II had placed Isak Bey Evrenoz and Hamza Kastrioti in command of the force. Isak bey was an experienced commander who had crushed John Kastrioti's rebellion in 1430 and led the Ottoman counterattack at the Siege of Berat. Hamza <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> with him several disaffected Albanian nobles and personal knowledge of the tactics they could expect from Skanderbeg. In total, Ottoman forces numbered between 50,000 and 80,000 men. Armies of this size were usually commanded by the sultan himself so rumors spread that Mehmed was leading the campaign. In contrast, Skanderbeg had between 8,000 and 10,000 men to stand in opposition.|$|E

5|$|Ellen {{encounters}} her possessed {{friend and}} flees into another room, grabbing knives to protect her. Something attempts {{to enter the}} room where Ellen is hiding, and she blindly lashes out with a knife - mistakenly stabbing Scotty who had just returned to the cabin. While horrified, Ellen is then attacked by the possessed Bruce. Ellen manages to trap Bruce outside, stabbing Bruce's hand {{several times in the}} process. The bleeding Scotty tells Ellen to look into the cellar for the gun they <b>brought</b> <b>along.</b> While walking {{down the stairs to the}} cellar, she trips on a broken step and injures herself. After finding the gun, she goes back up stairs and discovers that Scotty had been stabbed to death while she was downstairs. The demonic Bruce then attacks her, but she manages to cut off his hand.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995, R.E.M. {{set out on}} {{its first}} tour in six years. The tour was a huge {{commercial}} success, but the period was difficult for the group. On March 1, Berry collapsed on stage during a performance in Lausanne, Switzerland, having suffered a brain aneurysm. He had surgery immediately and recovered fully within a month. Berry's aneurysm {{was only the beginning}} of a series of health problems that plagued the Monster tour. Mills had to undergo abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal adhesion in July; a month later, Stipe had to have an emergency surgery to repair a hernia. Despite all the problems, the group had recorded the bulk of a new album while on the road. The band <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> eight-track recorders to capture its shows, and used the recordings as the base elements for the album. The final three performances of the tour were filmed at the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta, Georgia and released in home video form as Road Movie.|$|E
5|$|In June 2007, vocalist Adam Lazzara said Taking Back Sunday were {{preparing}} to write the follow-up album to Louder Now (2006). In July, bassist Matthew Rubano mentioned that {{the other members of}} the band were in the process of writing individually in separate locations: Rubano in Manhattan, Lazzara in Texas, guitarist Fred Mascherino in Jersey, drummer Mark O'Connell on Long Island and guitarist Eddie Reyes in Ohio. From late July to early September, the band participated in the 2007 Projekt Revolution tour. During the tour, they <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> a mobile recording studio and demoed material, and continued writing for their next album. Plans to do serious writing, as well as record their next album towards the end of the year, were in place.|$|E

5|$|On 3 December 1846, Brunner began {{what became}} his longest and most arduous expedition. He planned {{to follow the}} Buller River to the sea and then trek down the West Coast {{as far south as}} Milford Sound. During his {{previous}} expedition, he had been told of the existence of a route through the Southern Alps by the Māori at the Arahura River. He hoped to discover this route and use it to cross the Southern Alps and reach Canterbury. He was accompanied once again by Kehu, who <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> his wife. Another Māori, Pitewate, a friend of Kehu's, also joined the venture, accompanied by his wife. Brunner provided clothing and shoes for his companions. The wives proved problematic during the journey as they quarrelled, sometimes supported by their husbands, and Brunner would have to mediate.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than the}} show of force that had been {{intended}} by the Brazilian government, the war revealed the Empire's lack of military readiness. The Army of the South, stationed in Piraí Grande, was commanded by Field Marshal João Propício Mena Barreto (later Baron of São Gabriel) with two divisions. The 1st Division, under Brigadier Manuel Luís Osório (later Marquis of Erval), was formed by regular army units. The 2nd Division, under Brigadier José Luís Mena Barreto (who had since returned from his attack on Melo), was composed entirely of national guardsmen. Altogether, it numbered only 5,711 men—all (except some officers) native to Rio Grande do Sul. The army was poorly equipped for siege operations: it <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> no engineers (who could direct the construction of trenches); it was under-equipped, lacking even hatchets (necessary to cut fences, break through doors and scale walls); and its 12 cannons (a mix of La Hitte and Paixhans) were of small calibers ill-suited to attacking fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{expedition}} {{was given to}} Sivert Klevan, an engineer with a good instinct for public relations. The ice was to be procured from the glacier Svartisen, and a glaciologist was <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> to give advice. It {{soon became clear that}} the entire three-ton block could not be brought out in one go. Instead, 200kg blocks were cut out with a chainsaw, carried away on a sled, and flown by helicopter down to the town centre. There they were melted together to make a block of ice weighing 3,050kg. The block was placed in a specially constructed iron container, which was insulated with wood and glass wool. The container was placed on top of a truck that would carry {{it all the way to}} the Equator, accompanied by a van carrying equipment and a sedan with a film crew.|$|E
