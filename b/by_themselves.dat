5|$|Multiple organolithium {{reagents}} {{are known}} {{in which there}} is a direct bond between carbon and lithium atoms, effectively creating a carbanion. These are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. In many of these organolithium compounds, the lithium ions tend to aggregate into high-symmetry clusters <b>by</b> <b>themselves,</b> which is relatively common for alkali cations. LiHe, a very weakly interacting van der Waals compound, has been detected at very low temperatures.|$|E
