50|$|Historically, THAI Airways had Boeing <b>Customer</b> <b>Code</b> D7. For example, a Boeing 747-400 {{aircraft}} that the airline ordered directly from Boeing Commercial Airplanes was coded Boeing 747-4D7. Since {{the introduction of}} the Boeing 787, Boeing no longer uses <b>customer</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Boeing <b>customer</b> <b>code</b> for Air New Zealand was 19, {{which was}} {{inherited}} from the National Airways Corporation on its merger with Air New Zealand in 1978 (Air New Zealand itself didn't own any Boeing aircraft before 1978). This means a Boeing 777-200ER built for Air New Zealand was designated a 777-219ER. Since {{the introduction of the}} Boeing 787, Boeing no longer uses <b>customer</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mercury {{began by}} {{offering}} fixed-line facilities direct to businesses, residential and small business. Users {{could use the}} 'Mercury 2300' service via their existing BT phone line by dialling a '131' prefix followed by a ten-digit <b>customer</b> <b>code,</b> then the number which they wished to dial. At the time, many phones were manufactured with a dedicated 'Mercury Button' which allowed the prefix and <b>customer</b> <b>code</b> to be stored and then dialed with a single button press.|$|R

50|$|For model {{numbers in}} the 707 to 777 range, the model number {{consists}} of an airplane's model number, for example 707 or 747, followed by a dash and three digits that represent the series within the model, for example 707-320 or 747-400. In aviation circles, a more specific model designation is sometimes used where the last two digits of the series designator are replaced by the two digit, alpha-numeric Boeing <b>customer</b> <b>code,</b> for example 747-121, representing a 747-100 originally ordered by Pan American World Airways (Boeing <b>customer</b> <b>code</b> 21) or 737-7H4, representing a 737-700 originally ordered by Southwest Airlines (Boeing <b>customer</b> <b>code</b> H4). Unlike other models, the 787 uses a single digit to designate the series, for example 787-8. This convention was followed {{in the development of}} the newest version of the 747, the 747-8, along with the 737 MAX and 777X series.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this communication, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} the {{automatic}} extraction of numerical fields in handwritten documents.

Applying an HMM based syntactic analyzer on the overall document allows to localize/extract fields of interest. Reported results on the extraction of zip codes, phone numbers and <b>customer</b> <b>codes</b> from handwritten incoming mail documents demonstrate the interest of the proposed approach. ...|$|R
