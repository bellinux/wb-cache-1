5|$|In the {{tradition}} of Pentecostalism, female members of La Luz del Mundo do not wear jewelery or makeup and are instructed to wear full, long skirts. Women can have their hair as short as their shoulder blades. These restrictions {{do not apply to}} recreational activities, where wearing <b>bathing</b> <b>suits</b> is permitted. Women wear a head covering during religious meetings. According to an interview of one adherent, women in the Church are considered equal to men in social spheres and have equal capacities for obtaining higher education, social careers, and other goals that may interest them.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, necklines plunged at the back, sleeves {{disappeared}} and sides were cut away and tightened. With {{the development of}} new clothing materials, particularly latex and nylon, through the 1930s swimsuits gradually began hugging the body, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning. Women's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of midriff exposure. Coco Chanel made suntans fashionable, and in 1932 French designer Madeleine Vionnet offered an exposed midriff in an evening gown. They were seen a year later in Gold Diggers of 1933. The Busby Berkeley film Footlight Parade of 1932 showcases aquachoreography that featured bikinis. Dorothy Lamour's The Hurricane (1937) also showed two-piece <b>bathing</b> <b>suits.</b>|$|E
25|$|Germs, bacteria, {{and mold}} can grow very quickly on wet <b>bathing</b> <b>suits.</b> Medical {{professionals}} warn that wearing damp swimwear {{for long periods}} of time can cause a number of infections and rashes in children and adults, and warn against sharing <b>bathing</b> <b>suits</b> with others. They suggest that changing out of a wet bathing suit right away can help prevent vaginal infections and itching in females and Tinea Cruris ("Jock Itch") in males.|$|E

5000|$|In 1964, he {{enforced}} {{the prosecution}} {{of the use of}} monokini, a women's one-piece <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> that leaves the breasts uncovered. Such <b>bathing</b> <b>suit,</b> Mr. Frey went on to say, [...] "constituted a public offense against the sense of decency, punishable according to article 330 of the penal code. Consequently, the police chiefs must employ the services of the police so that the women who wear this <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> in public places are prosecuted." ...|$|R
50|$|Occasional some {{of these}} establishments offer also women-only or <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> times, or <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> {{optional}} hours {{for people who are}} less comfortable with mixed-gender nudity; Algemeen Dagblad reported in 2008 that women-only, bathing suit-required times are drawing Muslim women to the sauna.|$|R

25|$|Especially in Britain, men {{and women}} were usually segregated, so nobody of the {{opposite}} sex might catch sight of them in their <b>bathing</b> <b>suits,</b> which (although extremely modest by modern standards) were not considered proper clothing in which to be seen.|$|E

25|$|The {{tracks were}} made of {{concrete}} and fiberglass, which led to numerous serious abrasions on riders who took even mild spills. The tendency of some to ride in <b>bathing</b> <b>suits</b> so they could go on to Waterworld attractions afterward made this problem worse.|$|E
25|$|The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) {{was set up}} in 1842 with {{a mission}} to provide an {{education}} program and healthy sports to young men. The YMCA was responsible for providing swimming classes to countless numbers of American boys and teenagers. This included swimming in indoor pools. Swimming trunks were not permitted in their pools. In Lincoln, Nebraska in 1958, for example, learners were told just to bring a towel and not to bring trunks. In Sheboygan, Wisconsin in 1954, the Recreation Department reported that 404 youngsters had attended an 11-day swimming course where the boys were unhampered by <b>bathing</b> <b>suits.</b> When the YMCA began to admit females in the early 1960s, the wearing of <b>bathing</b> <b>suits</b> became a requirement.|$|E

50|$|Frog and Toad {{go down to}} {{the stream}} to go swimming. While Frog prefers to swim naked, Toad prefers to swim wearing a <b>bathing</b> <b>suit,</b> but tells Frog not to look at him when he's out of the water because the <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> makes him look funny. During the swim, a turtle comes by, {{prompting}} Toad to ask Frog to tell the turtle to leave. However, even though Frog justifies to the turtle why he wants him to leave, the turtle, plus some lizards, a grass snake, a pair of dragonflies, and a field mouse all want to see Toad's <b>bathing</b> <b>suit.</b> Toad decides to stay in the water till everybody leaves, but eventually comes out when he begins to sneeze. As soon as he gets out, everyone (including Frog) laughs at him proving that what he said about the <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> was true.|$|R

25|$|The {{culture of}} Christmas Island is unique, {{for people of}} many {{different}} ethnicities inhabit the area. The majority of residents are Chinese, but Europeans and Malays reside there as well with small Indian and Eurasian communities too. The main languages of Christmas Island are English and Chinese. Dress is usually modest, and tourists should keep a wrap, such as a sarong or pareo, on hand to cover shorts, <b>bathing</b> <b>suits,</b> and tank tops. It is common to remove shoes when entering a house and to also avoid touching anyone's head.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding her serious roles, Rosal {{would become}} best {{known in the}} 1950s for her daring {{appearances}} in film. She had no qualms appearing onscreen in <b>bathing</b> <b>suits,</b> engaging in kissing scenes or in playing villainous roles. Offscreen, Rosal led a quiet and private life. She enrolled in night classes at the Cosmopolitan Colleges and obtained a degree in Business Administration in 1954. She was married briefly in 1957 to an American pilot, Walter Gayda, {{with whom she had}} a child, Toni Rose, who later became a television host.|$|E
25|$|The video {{opens with}} a close shot of Knowles face who's wearing a similar make-up to English model Twiggy. The video then shows shots of Knowles moving her arms like a clock and wearing a black T-shirt and black trousers. Scenes similar to 1957 film Funny Face follow with Knowles looking like Audrey Hepburn. Those shots are cut {{by a variety of}} brightly colored <b>bathing</b> <b>suits</b> and a {{black-and-white}} hat, set against a constantly changing background of colors which is similar to Vogue photo shoots. Knowles' baby bump is less visible in the bathing suit scenes but is featured prominently earlier in the video. The clip cuts quickly from the bathing suit sequence to shots of Knowles in an audition space similar to the 1980 film Fame. The sequence features choreographed moves from Knowles and her back-up dancers who snap with their fingers which is a reference to 1961 musical West Side Story.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year, the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) relaxed rules regarding partial nudity on television, which previously forced undergarment {{manufacturers to}} use mannequins in their commercials, despite <b>bathing</b> <b>suits</b> and equally revealing swimwear being allowed. Playtex {{was the first}} to advertise with a live model wearing only a bra from the waist up. This attracted criticisms from members of the American Family Association and the Eagle Forum.

500|$|In 1907, Australian swimmer and {{performer}} Annette Kellerman {{was arrested}} on a Boston beach for wearing a form-fitting sleeveless one-piece knitted swimming tights that covered her from neck to toe, a costume she adopted from England, although it became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910. Even in 1943, pictures of the Kellerman swimsuit were produced as evidence of indecency in Esquire v. Walker, Postmaster General. But, Harper's Bazaar wrote in June 1920 (vol. 55, no. 6, p.138) - [...] "Annette Kellerman Bathing Attire is distinguished by an incomparable, daring beauty of fit that always remains refined."

500|$|Early in her career, her {{prominent}} {{breasts were}} considered problematic, {{and led to}} her losing her first professional assignment—an advertising campaign for General Electric that depicted young women in <b>bathing</b> <b>suits</b> relaxing around a pool. Emmeline Snively, head of the Blue Book Model Agency, sent her to photographer Gene Lester, which led to her short-lived assignment in the General Electric commercial. In 1954, she auditioned at both Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. for a part in The Seven Year Itch, but failed to impress. She also auditioned at Paramount for Joan of Arc—a project that was never completed—and failed again. That year, she landed her first acting assignment in Lux Video Theatre, a series on CBS (An Angel Went AWOL, October 21, 1954).
