40|$|Shunt tracheoesophageal {{speech is}} {{currently}} the most successful form of voice and speech rehabilitation in laryngectomees. Insertion of valve prostheses into the tracheoesophageal shunts has overcome drawbacks caused by stenosis of the shunt and aspiration. In 10 years of satisfactory results with the standard Groningen <b>button</b> <b>valve</b> prosthesis, the overall concept of this device has proved its value. The airflow resistance, however, is relatively high, so that a low-resistance device has been developed without changing the favorable characteristics of the standard device. The design of this low-resistance Groningen button is described. The airflow resistances of the standard and low-resistance Groningen buttons have been measured and compared. The airflow resistance of the low-resistance Groningen button is also compared with the reported airflow resistances of various other valve prostheses...|$|E
5000|$|Each valve was a wood disc {{with leather}} facing on both sides. One face had a center hole {{leading to a}} pocket of a larger {{diameter}} in the wood. The valve was supported only by a lever between the valve plate pivot and the pouch lifter disc, with a right angle dowel extension that [...] "plugged in" [...] the center hole of the <b>valve</b> <b>button.</b> The pivotal lever is easily removable {{because it was not}} cemented to the valve, rendering a loose <b>valve</b> <b>button</b> in the <b>valve</b> well behind the valve plate that was screwed onto the valve chest with white sealing compound.|$|R
50|$|AS-Interface (Actuator Sensor Interface, AS-i) is an {{industrial}} networking solution (physical layer, data access method and protocol) used in PLC, DCS and PC-based automation systems. It {{is designed for}} connecting simple field I/O devices (e.g. binary ON/OFF devices such as actuators, sensors, rotary encoders, analog inputs and outputs, push <b>buttons,</b> and <b>valve</b> position sensors) in discrete manufacturing and process applications using a single 2-conductor cable.|$|R
50|$|Aerosol paint (also called spray paint) {{is a type}} {{of paint}} that comes in a sealed {{pressurized}} container and is released in a fine spray mist when depressing a <b>valve</b> <b>button.</b> A form of spray painting, aerosol paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface. Standard sized cans are portable, inexpensive and easy to store. Aerosol primer can be applied directly to bare metal and many plastics.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a low-cost, {{low-voltage}} and low-power polypyrrole-membrane microfluidic pump with two one-way push <b>button</b> check <b>valves.</b> This polymeric microfluidic pump is fabricated with a conductive polymer (polypyrrole) modified poly dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane encased into a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) structure. The pumping action is induced by an electrochemical actuated PPy-PDMS membrane while check valves at the inlet and outlet control the flow direction in the respective pump phases. This pump is self-priming. Accurate control of the output flow rate {{can be obtained by}} changing the actuation frequency. With this pump, a maximum pumping rate of 52 μL/min was achieved using an input power of 55 mW operated at ± 1. 5 V...|$|R
5000|$|Spray paint (scientific name {{aerosol paint}} [...] ) {{is a type}} of paint that comes in a sealed {{pressurized}} container and is released in a Aerosol spray when depressing a <b>valve</b> <b>button.</b> Spray paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface, unlike many traditional rolled or brushed paints. Standard sized cans are lightweight, portable, cheap, and easy to store. Aerosol primer can be applied directly to bare metal and many plastics.|$|R
2500|$|Gas audibly {{leaked out}} at high pressure, drawing the {{attention}} of several men and triggering six gas alarms including the high level gas alarm. Before anyone could act, the gas ignited and exploded, blowing through the firewall made up of [...] panels bolted together, which were not designed to withstand explosions. The custodian pressed the emergency stop <b>button,</b> closing huge <b>valves</b> in the sea lines and ceasing all oil and gas extraction.|$|R
25|$|Aerosol paint, {{also called}} spray paint, {{is a type}} of paint that comes in a sealed {{pressurized}} container and is released in a fine spray mist when depressing a <b>valve</b> <b>button.</b> A form of spray painting, aerosol paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface, unlike many rolled or brushed paints. In 1949, Ed Seymour of Sycamore, Illinois invented aerosol paint, which he based on the same principle as spray deodorizers and insecticides. The conveyance featured a small can of paint packaged with an aerosol propellant and fitted with a spray head.|$|R
50|$|Nacre inlay {{is often}} used for music keys and other {{decorative}} motifs on musical instruments. Many accordion and concertina bodies are completely covered in nacre, and some guitars have fingerboard or headstock inlays made of nacre (as well as some guitars having plastic inlays designed to imitate the appearance of nacre). The bouzouki and baglamas (Greek plucked string instruments of the lute family) typically feature nacre decorations, as does the related Middle Eastern oud (typically around the sound holes and {{on the back of}} the instrument). Bows of stringed instruments such as the violin and cello often have mother of pearl inlay at the frog. It is traditionally used on saxophone keytouches, as well as the <b>valve</b> <b>buttons</b> of trumpets and other brass instruments.|$|R
5000|$|In most scuba sets, a {{buoyancy}} compensator (BC) or buoyancy {{control device}} (BCD), {{such as a}} back-mounted wing or stabilizer jacket (also known as a [...] "stab jacket"), {{is built into the}} harness. Although strictly speaking this is {{not a part of the}} breathing apparatus, it is usually connected to the diver's air supply, to provide easy inflation of the device. This can usually also be done manually via a mouthpiece, in order to save air while on the surface, or in case of a malfunction of the pressurized inflation system. The BCD inflates with air from the low pressure inflator hose to increase the volume of the scuba equipment and cause the diver gain buoyancy. Another <b>button</b> opens a <b>valve</b> to deflate the BCD and decrease the volume of the equipment and causes the diver to lose buoyancy. Some BCDs allow for integrated weight, meaning that the BCD has special pockets for the weights that can be dumped easily in case of an emergency. The function of the BCD, while underwater, is to keep the diver neutrally buoyant, i.e., neither floating up or sinking. The BCD is used to compensate for the compression of a wet suit, and to compensate for the decrease of the diver's mass as the air from the cylinder is breathed away.|$|R
