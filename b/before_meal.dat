40|$|Repaglinide (NovoNorm) is an {{antidiabetic}} oral {{agent of}} the new glinide class with insulinotropic activity. Its action on insulin secretion is more rapid and shorter than that of sulphonylurea compounds. Thanks to these properties, repaglinide is able to better control postprandial hyperglycaemia and {{is associated with a}} lower risk of delayed hypoglycaemic episodes. It is indicated for the treatment of type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus as monotherapy, after diet failure, or in combination with metformin, when the biguanide is insufficient. NovoNorm is commercialized as tablets of 0. 5, 1 and 2 mg, to be taken just before each meal. Initial dosis should be 0. 5 mg <b>before</b> <b>meal</b> in diabetic patients on diet alone or 1 mg <b>before</b> <b>meal</b> in patients already receiving an hypoglycaemic agent. If necessary, the dosis should be progressively increased, depending on the individual response, up to 4 mg <b>before</b> <b>meal</b> (maximal daily dosage of 16 mg), in order to optimize blood glucose control.

Therefore, this study was carried out at PG Hospital, IPGT and RA, Jamnagar to evaluate effect of Agnimanthadi compound in the patients of Sthaulya. For this purpose 83 patients of Sthaulya were selected out of which 15 patients were dropped out. Remaining 68 patients were treated in two groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Transient lower {{oesophageal}} sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) {{represent an}} interesting {{target for the}} treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Baclofen reduces TLESRs and reflux episodes, but is not optimal for clinical application because of its central side effects. Therefore, new agents are required. AIM: To study the effect of AZD 9343, a new selective GABA(B) receptor agonist, in healthy volunteers. METHODS: A total of 27 subjects participated in a placebo-controlled, randomized, two-centre phase I study. Subjects underwent oesophageal manometry and pH-metry for 3 h postprandially. <b>Before</b> <b>meal</b> ingestion, a single oral dose of placebo, 60 and 320 mg AZD 9343 or 40 mg baclofen was given on four separate days. RESULTS: Somnolence was reported after 320 mg AZD 9343 and baclofen. Reversible short-lasting paraesthesia was reported after AZD 9343. AZD 9343 320 mg and baclofen significantly reduced the number of TLESRs with 32 % and 40 % respectively. Acid reflux was significantly decreased by AZD 9343 and baclofen. Like baclofen, AZD 9343 increased LES pressure <b>before</b> <b>meal</b> intake. AZD 9343 320 mg and baclofen significantly reduced the swallowing rate. CONCLUSIONS: Like baclofen, AZD 9343 dose-dependently decreases the number of TLESRs and acid reflux episodes, increases LES pressure and reduces swallowing, extending the concept that GABA(B) agonists are potent reflux inhibitors. However, discovery of analogues with an improved side effect profile is warrante...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{investigating}} {{the influence of}} the time interval between injection of regular insulin and meal ingestion on postprandial glucose changes and overall blood glucose control in patients with type 1 diabetes on intensive insulin therapy. Fifteen C-peptide negative subjects were submitted, in a randomized order, to two 6 -week treatment periods in which regular insulin was injected either 5 minutes or 30 minutes before each of the three main meals, in combination with a bedtime NPH insulin injection. The changes in plasma glucose excursions following a breakfast test (Cmax, Tmax, Cmin, Tmin, AUC 0 - 240 min) were similar in the two experimental protocols. Furthermore, no significant changes were observed in daily insulin dosages nor in glucose profiles obtained using home blood glucose monitoring. Only a tendency to a greater 90 -minutes postprandial increase in blood glucose levels was observed when regular insulin was injected 5 minutes rather than 30 minutes <b>before</b> <b>meal.</b> Glycated haemoglobin levels were similar after each treatment period (7. 6 +/- 0. 2 % versus 7. 5 +/- 0. 2 %; NS) and no differences in the incidence or severity of hypoglycaemic episodes were noticed between the two insulin schemes. In conclusion, in type 1 diabetic patients who are rather well controlled with a basal-bolus insulin scheme, the injection of regular insulin 30 minutes before each main meal provides no significant advantage as compared to the injection of regular insulin 5 minutes <b>before</b> <b>meal.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E

We investigated the hypothesis that meal consumption may reduce tongue strength and endurance in older adults (OAs). Methods: Tongue–palate pressure, oral diadochokinesis, repetitive saliva swallowing, and surface electromyography activity before and after a meal were measured in 23 young adults (YAs) and 23 OA volunteers. Results: There was a statistically significant difference in both tongue pressure and the number of voluntary swallows between YAs and OAs. Peak tongue pressure was significantly lower in OAs than YAs both before and after meal consumption. The most notable finding was that the first time interval (the time from test initiation {{to the beginning of the}} first swallow) was prolonged after meal consumption only in OAs, whereas the first time interval showed no difference between YAs and OAs <b>before</b> <b>meal</b> consumption with reference to the repetitive saliva swallowing test. The initiation of swallowing was prolonged by both meal consumption and aging; there was a significant interaction between these two factors. The number of repetitions of the monosyllable/pa/was statistically similar between YAs and OAs <b>before</b> <b>meal</b> consumption, but it was significantly lower in OAs after meal consumption. Conclusion: Aging leads to declining tongue pressure and motor function of the lips. It is possible that swallowing function declines in older individuals when meal consumption is prolonged, especially at the end of mealtime, {{as a result of}} their efforts in mastication and swallowing.
