5|$|Planets are {{generally}} {{divided into two}} main types: large low-density giant planets, and smaller rocky terrestrials. Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System. In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they are the four terrestrials, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then the four giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Six of the planets are orbited <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> natural satellites.|$|E
5|$|Recreational {{cross-country}} skiing includes ski touring and groomed-trail skiing, typically at resorts or in parklands. It is an accessible form of recreation {{for persons with}} vision and mobility impairments. A related form of recreation is dog skijoring—a winter sport where a cross-country skier is assisted <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> dogs.|$|E
5|$|The call or croak of a frog {{is unique}} to its species. Frogs create this sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat. In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> vocal sacs, {{membranes}} of skin under the throat or {{on the corner of}} the mouth, that distend during the amplification of the call. Some frog calls are so loud that they can be heard up to a mile away.|$|E

As they are often key to the story, friendly characters must not be killed in combat except during scripted events. In between combat missions, the player can move around the USS Voyager and interact {{with other members of}} its crew, often performing non-combat tasks to progress the story.|$|E
5|$|The poem, {{following}} the traditional Kalevala metre, has survived as several 17th and 18th century literations from {{various parts of}} Finland. Some of its elements appear in earlier works, but it hardly dates older than the vita. There is debate on whether the original poem was constructed <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> individuals. The writer has however had superficial understanding of the church legends.|$|E

A 14-member list of candidates may also be submitted for the Croatian diaspora constituency, while a two-member list can be submitted for the ethnic-minority representatives. In each case, 500 endorsements are required for an election list to become valid. The lists may be supported <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> political parties, or by a group of voters as an independent list. No one may be a candidate on two or more lists simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|It {{also has}} a more {{extensive}} classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow. The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack {{and the formation of}} ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.|$|E
5|$|More {{people moved}} to Lajjun during the British mandate period, {{particularly}} in the late thirties, due to the British crackdown on participants in the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. The tomb of Yusuf Hamdan, a local leader of the revolt, {{is located in the}} village. Lajjun's economy grew rapidly {{as a result of the}} influx of the additional population. As the village expanded, it was divided into three quarters, one to the east, one to the west, and another known as Khirbat al-Khan. Each quarter was inhabited <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> hamulas ("clans"); the al-Mahajina al-Tahta and al-Ghubariyya clans, the al-Jabbarin and al-Mahamid clans, and the al-Mahajina al-Fawqa clan.|$|E

5|$|Prokaryotes {{have only}} one lipid bilayer- the cell {{membrane}} (also known as the plasma membrane). Many prokaryotes also have a cell wall, but the cell wall is composed of proteins or long chain carbohydrates, not lipids. In contrast, eukaryotes {{have a range of}} organelles including the nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum. All of these sub-cellular compartments are surrounded <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> lipid bilayers and, together, typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in the cell. In liver hepatocytes for example, the plasma membrane accounts for only two percent of the total bilayer area of the cell, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum contains more than fifty percent and the mitochondria a further thirty percent.|$|E
5|$|Since 1963, {{the custom}} in most {{years has been}} to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, {{typically}} <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> legendary players. The original honorary starters were Jock Hutchison and Fred McLeod; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on {{until his death in}} 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} for an ancestral world of RNA cells and computer analysis of viral and host DNA sequences are giving {{a better understanding}} of the evolutionary relationships between different viruses and may help identify the ancestors of modern viruses. To date, such analyses have not proved which of these hypotheses is correct. However, it seems unlikely that all currently known viruses have a common ancestor, and viruses have probably arisen numerous times in the past <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> mechanisms.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} {{evolution in}} dreadnought protection {{came with the}} development of the anti-torpedo bulge and torpedo belt, both attempts to protect against underwater damage by mines and torpedoes. The purpose of underwater protection was to absorb the force of a detonating mine or torpedo well away from the final watertight hull. This meant an inner bulkhead {{along the side of the}} hull, which was generally lightly armoured to capture splinters, separated from the outer hull <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> compartments. The compartments in between were either left empty, or filled with coal, water or fuel oil.|$|E
5|$|There {{are about}} 325 {{undergraduates}} and 150 postgraduates. About {{half of the}} undergraduates studied at state schools before coming to Oxford, and about 10% are from overseas. Students from the college participate {{in a variety of}} extracurricular activities. Some contribute to student journalism for Cherwell or The Oxford Student. The Turl Street Arts Festival (a week-long student-organised event) is held annually in conjunction with the two other colleges on Turl Street, Exeter and Lincoln colleges. The festival, which takes place in Fifth Week of Hilary term, includes exhibitions, plays and concerts. Although the college does not award choral scholarships, the chapel choir is well-attended by college members and others. The choir is non-auditioning for college members, and is run <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> undergraduate organ scholars.|$|E

5|$|Pinkerton, who in 1816 was the BFBS's {{representative}} in Moscow, had met that {{year with a}} community of Albanians in Vienna, then capital of the Austrian Empire. They assured him that a translation of the New Testament into Albanian was indeed possible. In {{a letter to his}} superiors at the BFBS, dated August 28, 1816, Pinkerton wrote that the Albanian nation occupied {{a large part of the}} ancient Illyria, that they spoke a language completely different from Slavic, Turkish, Greek, or Latin, and that for the Albanian Orthodox the mass was recited in Greek, a language that believers and even some of the priests did not understand. According to Pinkerton, the translation could be done <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> Albanians from the Ionian islands under the supervision of an Albanian bishop.|$|E
5|$|The Manche Ch'ol {{lacked a}} complex {{political}} organisation, and possessed no large towns within their territory. Their largest settlement was Manche itself, with about one hundred multi-family houses. Manche {{was also the}} name of the principal lineage at Manche and this lineage was the origin of the populations of the other Manche Ch'ol towns. Nito was another principal settlement, and an important port for maritime trade that maintained strong links with places as far away as the province of Acalan in what is now southern Campeche in Mexico. Otherwise, the Manche Ch'ol lived in generally small settlements governed <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> chieftains; they were less politically complex than their Lakandon and Itza neighbours, and were not ruled by a principal king or chieftain. They grew relatively little maize, rather concentrating their agricultural production upon the prestige crops of cacao, annatto and vanilla. All the main settlements, both on the coast and inland, were noted for their prodigious cacao and annatto plantations.|$|E
