50|$|The {{cleaning}} needle on the Svea 123R {{model has}} two small toothed cogs that face each other, which cleans the <b>burner</b> <b>jet</b> {{from both the}} inside and outside when using the stove. The cleaning needle moves upward and downward when the spindle is turned; when the spindle is fully opened, the needle clears the burner jet’s opening. As the spindle is closed, the needle retracts into the burner housing. In this way, any soot that may clog the <b>burner</b> <b>jet</b> is expelled.|$|E
5000|$|To {{light the}} stove, {{the fuel tank}} must first be {{pre-heated}} and pressurized by lighting {{a small amount of}} fuel poured into the primer pan or spirit cup (a small well) on top of the tank {{at the base of the}} vaporizer (the vertical stem connecting the fuel tank to the burner). Alternatively, the primer pan can be filled directly from the fuel tank by opening the control valve and warming the fuel tank by holding it in one’s hands. This will increase the pressure in the fuel tank and force a small amount of fuel to trickle out of the <b>burner</b> <b>jet</b> and into the primer pan. [...] The control valve must then be closed before lighting the priming fuel so as to allow pressure to build up in the tank when the exterior fuel begins to heat the tank and the fuel within. The tank can also be pressurized by an optional pump that may be attached to the filler cap, but this is generally not necessary except in extreme cold. Fuel from the tank is fed by a cotton wick inside the tank to the base of the vaporizer. The heat and pressure created by the priming flame vaporizes the fuel inside the vaporizer. When the priming flame is nearly burnt out, the control valve is opened by turning the adjusting key. This allows the vaporized fuel to flow under pressure through the <b>burner</b> <b>jet</b> (a small opening at the base of the burner), where it mixes with oxygen and burns with a blue flame. Adjusting the flow of the vaporized fuel that is forced through the <b>burner</b> <b>jet</b> controls the flame size and heat output. The control valve (a spindle) is threaded in the vaporizer's housing, and as it is opened (by turning the adjusting key) it opens like a faucet (counter-clockwise to open and clockwise to close) and the vaporized fuel flows through the <b>burner</b> <b>jet.</b> Closing the spindle closes the fuel supply. A small plate on the top of the burner (a flame spreader) spreads the flame outwards. The heat generated in the burner and vaporizer maintains the internal pressure in the fuel tank.|$|E
5000|$|Made {{of solid}} brass, the Svea 123 weighs about 500 grams (19 ounces), {{measures}} 100 mm x 130 mm (3.9” x 5.1”) and will burn {{for over an}} hour on full tank (about 4 ounces) of fuel. Later models (designated the “Svea 123R” and also sold as the Optimus “Climber”) were made with a built-in cleaning needle to keep the <b>burner</b> <b>jet</b> from clogging by pushing soot or other impurities outward; early Sievert models without the self-cleaning needle came with a small wire pricker that is used to clean the <b>burner</b> <b>jet</b> manually by pushing the soot inwards. These older models are distinguishable by their downwardly-angled spindle and control valve, to which the adjusting key is attached. The spindle on a Svea 123R with the self-cleaning needle is at a right angle to the stem. Other differences between older and newer models include the vaporizer on older models, which is smooth, while newer models of both the Svea 123 and the 123R are finned and have a stronger joint configuration at the base. The pressure-relief valve in the filler cap has also been redesigned several times to improve both reliability as well as re-seating of the valve after it has opened. [...] The pentagonal hole in the pressure relief valve is designed as a vent, not a key socket. The valve disassembles easily with a pliers. A brass windscreen attaches directly to the stove, and has built-in pot supports that fold inward for storage. The aluminum lid comes with a detachable handle and can also be used as a small cook-pot.|$|E

40|$|The rotary kilns used in {{the iron}} pellet {{production}} in the grate-kiln pelletizing process of LKAB have two asymmetric secondary air channels to supply excessive air needed for combustion and the pellet sintering processes. As {{a consequence of the}} high flow rates and irregular-shaped secondary air channels, the aerodynamics in the kiln is strongly connected to the combustion and sintering performance. In this work a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study is performed with ANSYS CFX on the mixing between the primary <b>burner</b> <b>jet</b> and the asymmetric co-flows. This is done for a downscaled, simplified kiln model established in a previous experimental work. The unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (uRANS) equations are applied and three turbulence models are evaluated. Qualitatively, recirculation forms in the upper side of the kiln and behind the back plate for all turbulence models. It indicates a potential risk for a circulation of combustion products and a transport of them back toward the flame. No vortex shedding is found and it agrees with previous experiment. A comparison among turbulence models shows that the modified k-epsilon model yields a more physical and realistic flow field than a standard k-epsilon while the former underestimates the jet spreading. The result from Speziale-Sarkar-Garski Reynolds Stress Model (SSGRSM hereafter) illustrates different lateral development of the jet when compared to the k-e models. Quantitatively, the predictions of velocity decay and spreading rate of standard k-e model agree the best with experiment. The modified k-epsilon model predicts the smallest decay rates, corresponding to the longest jet seen in the instantaneous flow field. Results from the modified k-epsilon model are quite close to SSGRSM especially regarding the spreading rate. The simulations furthermore reveal that more experiments need to be carried out...|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{experimental study}} {{was performed to}} elucidate the conditions for which cellular patterns of diluted hydrogen diffusion flames near extinction were observed. The formation of cellular instabilities was studied for several burners: <b>jet</b> <b>burners</b> (axisymmetric <b>jet</b> and two-dimensional jet) and a novel one-dimensional burner. The fuel and oxidizer Lewis numbers and the initial mixture strength (fuel-to-oxygen concentration ratio normalized by the stoichiometric value) were identified as the key governing parameters. The formation of cellular flames occurs for low reactant Lewis numbers (less than one) and near the extinction limit. For the <b>jet</b> <b>burners,</b> the parameter space for cellularity was found to decrease with either decreasing initial mixture strength, either increasing the fuel jet velocity. For a given fuel mixture, the wavelength associated with the cellular instabilities was found to decrease with either decreasing oxygen concentration, or increasing the fuel jet velocity. To study the supression of hydrodynamic effects on the cellular instabilities, a unique burner was constructed to experimentally realize a onedimensional unstrained planar non-premixed flame, previously only considered in idealized theoretical models.

All gas equipment in Great Britain (but not Northern Ireland) was converted (by the fitting of different-sized <b>burner</b> <b>jets</b> to give the correct gas/air mixture) from burning town gas to burn natural gas (mainly methane) over the period from 1967 to 1977 {{at a cost of about}} £100 million including the writing off of redundant town gas manufacturing plants. All the gas-using equipment of almost thirteen million domestic, four hundred thousand commercial, and sixty thousand industrial customers was converted. Many dangerous appliances were discovered in this exercise and were taken out of service. The UK town gas industry died in 1987 when operations ceased at the last town gas manufacturing plants in Northern Ireland (Belfast, Portadown and Carrickfergus; Carrickfergus gas works is now a restored gas works museum). The Portadown site has been cleared and is now the subject of a long term experiment into the use of bacteria for the purpose of cleaning up contaminated industrial land. As well as requiring little processing before use, natural gas is non-toxic; the carbon monoxide (CO) in town gas made it extremely poisonous, accidental poisoning and suicide by gas being commonplace. Poisoning from natural gas appliances is only due to incomplete combustion, which creates CO, and flue leaks to living accommodation. As with town gas, a small amount of foul-smelling substance (mercaptan) is added to the gas to indicate to the user that there is a leak or an unlit burner, the gas having no odour of its own.|$|R

A three dimensional CFD simulation {{is carried out}} to explain the phenomenon of axis switching in premixed flame jets.

These vortices control the spreading (in a preferential manner) of the flame jet along the tube axis. This preferential spreading of the flame jet is responsible for switching of contours of heat flux on the impingement plate. Furthermore, for the rectangular burner, elliptical lobes of heat flux distribution on the impingement plate are observed and this is again attributed to vortex structures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis {{experimental}} investigation to study turbulent flame characteristics using laser based methods is presented. Combustion inside almost all technical industrial devices takes place under turbulent environment. In addition, {{a significant amount}} of effort is ongoing to improve the knowledge of turbulent combustion. This work is focussed on the turbulent-chemistry interaction, which remains to be the bottleneck problem in turbulent combustion. Combustion flames from turbulent opposed <b>jet</b> <b>burner</b> and swirl stabilized burner have been investigated using laser induced fluorescence utilizing single-point, single-scalar as well as state of the art multi-scalar, planar technique. Investigation on flames from turbulent opposed <b>jet</b> <b>burner</b> has been carried out. With the same burner set-up, flames from the partially-premixed mode to the premixed mode have been studied while varying parameters like Reynolds numbers and equivalence ratio. The results from the current work provide a detailed insight on flame physics, flame front characteristics, flame front dynamics and extinction phenomenon. Local flame area distribution results have been evaluated and used to confirm for the flame symmetry of turbulent opposed <b>jet</b> <b>burner.</b> It is found that flame stability is decreased not due to small wrinkling of the flame front but due to the total flame stretch, thus confirming the presence of "young turbulence". Young turbulence is characterized by large eddies that yet do not have decayed to smaller structures along the turbulent energy cascade due to limited residence time. In addition it is also concluded that flame extinction phenomenon is due to the large eddies rather than small eddies that disrupts the reaction zone. A technical relevant lean premixed flame from a swirled stabilized turbulent <b>jet</b> <b>burner</b> was used as another test case. Location of peak heat release rate using state of the art planar laser induced fluorescence has been studied in this flame. Single laser system has been used to simultaneously detect two molecular species namely, hydroxyl [OH] and formaldehyde [HCHO]. Snap-shot of peak heat release rate have been provided by simultaneously multiplying spatially and temporarily matched images from both detected molecule. 1000 single-shot images have been taken to build sufficient and clean statistical results. In addition to the experimental work, advanced image processing routines have been developed and applied for automatic data enhancement and analysis. Several algorithms employing filters, smoothing functions and image enhancement were tested and checked for their end results. Sensitive analysis to choose the combination of right parameters has been also done and is specific to the images evaluated in the present work. Lastly, experimental investigation from the current thesis will help in building a data bank for such flames. As the numerical models due to their limitations, requires experimental information to test for their efficacy and capabilities, these results will help to validate numerical models...|$|R
