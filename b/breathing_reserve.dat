40|$|Cardiopulmonary {{exercise}} testing (CPET) {{plays an important}} role in the assessment of functional capacity in patients with interstitial lung disease. The aim of this study was to identify CPET measures that might be helpful in predicting the vital capacity and diffusion capacity outcomes of patients with thoracic sarcoidosis. A longitudinal study was conducted on 42 nonsmoking patients with thoracic sarcoidosis (median age = 46. 5 years, 22 females). At the first evaluation, spirometry, the measurement of single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (D LCOsb) and CPET were performed. Five years later, the patients underwent a second evaluation consisting of spirometry and D LCOsb measurement. After 5 years, forced vital capacity (FVC) % and D LCOsb% had decreased significantly [95. 5 (82 - 105) vs 87. 5 (58 - 103) and 93. 5 (79 - 103) vs 84. 5 (44 - 102), respectively; P < 0. 0001 for both]. In CPET, the peak oxygen uptake, maximum respiratory rate, <b>breathing</b> <b>reserve,</b> alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure gradient at peak exercise (P(A-a) O 2), and &# 916; SpO 2 values showed a strong correlation with the relative differences for FVC% and D LCOsb% (P < 0. 0001 for all).

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe study {{sought to}} compare the {{relative}} discrimination of various cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) variables between cardiac and respiratory disease. BackgroundCPX testing is used in many cardiorespiratory diseases. However, discrimination of cardiac and respiratory dysfunction can be problematic. Anaerobic threshold (AT) and oxygen-uptake to work-rate relationship (VO 2 /WR slope) have been proposed as diagnostic of cardiac dysfunction, but multiple variables have not been compared. MethodsA total of 73 patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) (n = 25), heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (n = 40), or combined COPD and HFrEF (n = 8) were recruited and underwent CPX testing on a bicycle ergometer. Following a familiarization test, each patient underwent a personalized second test aiming for maximal exercise after ∼ 10 min. Measurements from this test were used to calculate area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC). ResultsPeak VO 2 was similar between the 2 principal groups (COPD 17. 1 ± 4. 6 ml/min/kg; HFrEF 16. 4 ± 3. 6 ml/min/kg). <b>Breathing</b> <b>reserve</b> (AUC: 0. 91) and percent predicted oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) (AUC: 0. 87) had the greatest ability to discriminate between COPD and HFrEF. VO 2 /WR slope performed significantly worse (AUC: 0. 68). VO 2 at the AT did not discriminate (AUC for AT as percent predicted peak VO 2 : 0. 56). OUES and <b>breathing</b> <b>reserve</b> remained strong discriminators when compared with an external cohort of healthy matched controls, and were comparable to B-type natriuretic peptide. ConclusionsBreathing reserve and OUES discriminate heart failure from COPD. Despite it being considered an important determinant of cardiac dysfunction, the AT could not discriminate these typical clinical populations while the VO 2 /WR slope showed poor to moderate discriminant ability.

40|$|Objective. Exercise {{tolerance}} {{is often}} reduced {{in patients with}} systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Mechanisms have been proposed but the underlying causes {{have not yet been}} elucidated. The study of pulmonary gas exchange during exercise may be helpful in revealing circulatory, ventilatory, and metabolic abnormalities. We hypothesized that in SLE, exercise aerobic capacity would be reduced due to chronic inactivity and poor muscle energetics. Methods. Thirteen women with SLE and low disease activity were studied; 5 age matched subjects served as controls. Clinical examination, chest radiography, electrocardiogram, and pulmonary function test were all normal. Subjects underwent 1 min incremental cycle ergometer exercise to exhaustion. Oxygen uptake (VO 2), CO 2 output (VCO 2), minute ventilation (V(E)), heart rate (HR), and arterial O 2 saturation were monitored. Anaerobic threshold (AT), VO 2 /HR, ΔVO 2 /ΔWatt, respiratory rate (RR), T(i) /T(tot), V(E) /VCO 2, and <b>breathing</b> <b>reserve</b> (BR) were computed. Results. At rest, patients exhibited high V(E), respiratory alkalosis, and a wide alveolar-arterial O 2 gradient [(A - a) O 2] during 50 % O 2 breathing. Other indexes of respiratory function were within the normal range. In the 6 patients with SLE where pulmonary artery systolic pressure at Doppler echocardiography was measurable, mean level was in the upper limits of normal. During exercise, maximal aerobic capacity was reduced in all patients (VO 2 peak, 1098 ± 74 vs 2150 ± 160 ml/min, p < 0. 01; AT, 36 ± 3 vs 48 ± 3 % predicted VO 2 max, p < 0. 05). Ventilation adjusted for the metabolic demand (V(E) /VCO 2 at AT) was increased (31 ± 1 vs 24 ± 1; p < 0. 05). A normal breathing pattern was observed during all tests. No patient stopped exercising because of ventilatory limitation (i. e., they had normal <b>breathing</b> <b>reserve).</b> Conclusion. Reduced muscle aerobic capacity is common in SLE and is most likely because of peripheral muscle deconditioning. Increased ventilatory demand, secondary to diffuse interstitial lung disease, is not a significant contributor to the reduction in exercise tolerance...|$|E
30|$|We {{chose to}} compare PSV with either NAVA or PAV+ instead of {{choosing}} only one proportional mode, because we {{aimed to explore}} potential differences of proportional versus pressure support ventilation on exercise performance. Since NAVA and PAV+ both resemble proportional ventilation, choosing {{one of them would}} only limit our experience to one single mode and one single brand. This would be an issue regarding the difficulty to recruit such patients. Additionally, our primary end point was the effect of ventilator mode on work efficiency and not peak VO 2. A number of factors such as circulatory impairment, muscle fiber type, body mass index, <b>breathing</b> <b>reserve</b> and peak heart rate may strongly influence the linearity between VO 2 and work relationship [54, 55]. Hence, it has been proposed to use work efficiency as a better reflection of exercise tolerance [54, 56, 57].

Methods and Results. 27 HFNEF patients who showed LV diastolic dysfunction in pressure-volume (PV) loop analysis performed symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and were compared with 12 patients who did not show diastolic dysfunction in PV loop analysis.

40|$|The {{cardiopulmonary}} exercise test (CPET) is {{an important}} physiological investigation that can aid clinicians in their evaluation of exercise intolerance and dyspnea.

Methods: In this study, resting in the spirometric measurements, exercise capacity of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) compared with healthy individuals. Exercise capacity of COPD patients and healthy controls were performed and were compared in terms of dynamic hyperinflation. Results: Patients with stable COPD (n= 19) and healthy controls (n= 13) were included. Subjects performed pulmonary function tests and an incremental exercise test on cycle ergometry (Inspiratory capacity (IC), end expiratory lung volume (EELV)). Statistically significant differences (p< 0. 05) were found regarding exercise test parameters including exercise duration, maximum oxygen uptake, <b>breathing</b> <b>reserve,</b> maximum minute ventilation, and breathing pattern between groups. There was significant increase in EELV (p< 0. 05) and decrease in IC (p< 0. 05) at maximum exercise when hyperinflation parameters were compared at baseline and maximum exercise.

40|$|Background: Patients with {{systemic}} sclerosis (SSc) {{may develop}} exercise intolerance due to musculoskeletal involvement, restrictive lung disease, left ventricular dysfunction, or pulmonary vasculopathy (PV). The latter {{is particularly important}} since it may lead to lethal pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Methods: Thirty SSc patients from the Harbor-UCLA Rheumatology clinic, not clinically suspected of having significant pulmonary vascular disease, were referred for this prospective study. Resting pulmonary function and exercise gas exchange were assessed, including peakVO 2, anaerobic threshold (AT), heart rate- VO 2 relationship (O 2 -pulse), exercise <b>breathing</b> <b>reserve</b> and parameters of ventilation-perfusion mismatching, as evidenced by elevated ventilatory equivalent for CO 2 (VE/VCO 2) and reduced end-tidal pCO 2 (PETCO 2) at the AT. Results: Gas exchange patterns were abnormal in 16 pts with specific cardiopulmonary disease physiology: Eleven patients had findings consistent with PV, while five had findings consistent with left-ventricular dysfunction (LVD).

Peak oxygen consumption, ventilatory anaerobic threshold, and physical working capacity {{were compared with}} normal reference values. Neurologic assessment included neuromuscular function, inattentiveness, and hyperactivity. Patient- and procedure-related variables were assessed for association with peak oxygen consumption, ventilatory anaerobic threshold, and physical working capacity. ResultsCompared with healthy children, peak oxygen consumption (88 % ± 16 % of predicted) and ventilatory anaerobic threshold (91 % ± 21 % of predicted) were mildly reduced.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In non-small-cell {{lung cancer}} patients, high peak oxygen uptake (peak V̇O 2) predicts {{lower rates of}} {{postoperative}} complications and better long-term survival. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) may negatively impact peak V̇O 2. METHODS: Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was performed in 34 consecutive stage IIIA/IIIB non-small-cell lung cancer subjects scheduled for elective lung surgery. Using multivariate linear regression adjusted for potential confounders, we compared CPET results in subjects receiving or not receiving NAC (NAC+, n = 19; NAC-, n = 15). RESULTS: Adjusted peak V̇O 2 was lower in NAC + compared with NAC- subjects (- 5. 3 mL/min/kg [95 % CI - 8. 3 to - 2. 2], P =. 01). Likewise, oxygen pulse, maximal work load, and ventilatory threshold were also lower in NAC+ subjects, whereas peak heart rate and <b>breathing</b> <b>reserve</b> were similar. NAC+ subjects presented lower values of diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (P =. 035) and hemoglobin concentrations (P <. 001). DLCO was strongly correlated with peak V̇O 2 (r(2) = 0. 56). Adjustment for DLCO reduced the effect of NAC on peak V̇O 2 without suppressing it. CONCLUSIONS: NAC was associated with lower preoperative peak V̇O 2 in subjects with non-small-cell lung cancer. This lower aerobic fitness may result from NAC-induced reduction in pulmonary gas exchange or heart toxicity. Since lower fitness is linked to poorer outcome, the decision for NAC {{may have to be}} balanced with its possible toxicity...|$|E

She had no symptomatic benefit from escalation of bronchodilator therapy and her peak expiratory flow (PEF) remained reduced despite multiple courses of oral corticosteroid. Lung function at rest showed mild air flow obstruction with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) of 2. 27 l (75 % predicted), forced vital capacity (FVC) of 3. 13 l (89 % predicted) and a FEV 1 /FVC ratio of 73 %.

So far, it is generally accepted that an individualized exercise protocol with exercise duration of 6 to 12 minutes is preferable to assess maximal exercise performance. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare an individualized NYHA adapted exercise protocol with a fixed standard protocol in patients with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. Methods Twenty-two patients (17 female, 5 male; mean age 49 ± 14 yrs) underwent symptom limited CPET on a bicycle. On two consecutive days each subject performed a stepwise CPET according to a modified Jones protocol (16 Watt per minute stages) as well as an individualized NYHA adapted protocol with 5 or 10 Watt/min stages in a randomized order. Oxygen uptake at peak exercise (peakVO 2) and anaerobic threshold (VO 2 AT), maximal ventilation (VE), <b>breathing</b> <b>reserve</b> (VE/MVV), ventilatory efficiency (VE vs. VCO 2 slope), exercise time, maximal power and work rate were assessed and compared between both protocols. Results Comparing both, adapted NYHA protocol and standardized Jones protocol, we found significant differences in maximal power (56. 7 ± 19 W vs. 74 ± 18 W; p 2, VO 2 AT and VE vs. VCO 2 slope. Conclusion Variations of incremental step size during CPET significantly affect exercise time and maximal power, whereas relevant parameters for clinical judgement and prognosis such as oxygen uptake, ventilation and ventilatory efficiency remain unchanged.

40|$|Rationale: Limited {{information}} is available about the long-term outcome of lung function and exercise capacity in young adults born prematurely. Objective: To determine long-term effects of prematurity on lung function (volumes, diffusing capacity) and exercise capacity in expreterms compared with healthy peers. Methods: In a prospective cohort study, children born with a gestational age of less than 32 wk and/or a birth weight under 1, 500 g were followed up for 19 yr. Participants (n = 42; mean gestational age, 30 wk, and mean birth weight, 1, 246 g) and healthy term control subjects (n = 48) were recruited for lung function and exercise tests. Measurements: Spirometry, bodybox (TLCbox), diffusing capacity (DLCO), bicycle ergometer test. Main Results: Preterm birth was associated with lower FEV 1 (preterms, 95 % predicted, vs. controls, 110 % predicted; p < 0. 001), DL(CO) sb (88 % predicted vs. 96 % predicted, p = 0. 003), and exercise capacity (load, 185 vs. 216 W; p < 0. 001; anaerobic threshold: mean, 1, 546 vs. 1, 839 ml/min; p < 0. 001) compared with control subjects at follow-up.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The goal of {{this study}} was to explore the {{relation}} between oxygen kinetics during constant work load submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) and disease severity in adult subjects with cystic fibrosis. METHODS: Fourteen adult subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF; 8 males, 22 4 y old) and a mean Schwachman score of 73 11 and 10 healthy individuals (5 males, 29 4 y old) underwent pulmonary function tests at rest, maximal and constant work load submaximal CPET on a cycloergometer. Breath-by-breath analysis was used for measuring oxygen kinetic parameters and the time constant (tau), expressing phase 2 of submaximal CPET. RESULTS: Subjects with CF had a significantly prolonged tau compared with healthy subjects (42. 3 21. 5 vs 29. 3 6. 4, s, P <. 05). The tau during phase 2 was inversely correlated with FEV 1 (% pred) (r 0. 77, P. 001), <b>breathing</b> <b>reserve</b> (r 0. 74, P. 003), V ˙ O 2 peak (r 0. 53, P. 049), V ˙ O 2 /t slope (r 0. 58, P. 03), and Schwachman score (r 0. 80, P. 001). In a multivariate regression model including all the above variables, the Schwachman score (0. 697, P. 002) emerged as independent predictor of tau (R 2 0. 719, P. 001). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that adult subjects with CF present significant prolonged oxygen kinetics during constant work load submaximal exercise in relation to disease severity. Thus, submaximal exercise should be considered the preferable CPET choice in adult patients with severe CF. Key words: cystic fibrosis; submaximal exercise; time constant (tau).

Outcome measures were the incremental shuttle walking test and a constant-load cycle endurance test at 75 % of peak work rate including the measurement of physiological responses, and health status measured using the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire. Statistically significant between-group differences were found in favour of the inspiratory pressure support of 10 cmH 2 O group for improvement in shuttle walking distance (16 ¡ 17 versus 3 ¡ 13 %), cycle endurance (164 ¡ 124 versus 88 ¡ 128 %), and the reduction in minute ventilation during exercise (- 11 ¡ 10 versus- 2 ¡ 9 %). It was concluded that exercise training with inspiratory pressure support of 10 cmH 2 O resulted in statistically significantly larger improvements in exercise performance than training with inspiratory pressure support of 5 cmH 2 O in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease suffering from a ventilatory limited exercise capacity. Inspiratory pressure support of 10 cmH 2 O may be considered as adjunct during high-intensity exercise training...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn healthy subjects, oxygen {{consumption}} and cardiorespiratory responses are lower during eccentric exercise (negative work, Wneg) than during concentric exercise (positive work, Wpos) {{at the same}} work load. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the ventilatory response to Wneg in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The study population consisted of 12 subjects with COPD [forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) mean (SD) : 1 · 5 (0 · 4) 1, 46 (16) % of predicted]. Concentric and eccentric exercise tests (6 min exercise; interval ≥ 1 h) were performed in random order at constant work loads of 25 and 50 % of the individual maximal (positive) work capacity. Expired ventilation per minute (V̇E), {{oxygen consumption}} (V̇O 2) and carbon dioxide production (V̇CO 2) were 30 % lower during Wneg than during Wpos for both work intensities. The <b>breathing</b> <b>reserve</b> during 25 %Wneg was 11 (8) % and during 50 %Wneg was 18 (14) % higher than during Wpos at corresponding work loads (P< 0 · 01). V̇E/V̇O 2 and V̇E/V̇CO 2 were similar during Wpos and Wneg. Arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2) increased by 0 · 1 (0 · 4) kPa during 50 %Wneg and by 0 · 7 (0 · 5) kPa during 50 %Wpos (P< 0 · 01). During 50 %Wneg, perceived leg effort (modified Borg scale) tended to be higher than perceived breathlessness (2 · 4 (1 · 2) vs. 2 · 0 (1 · 1). It was concluded that in subjects with COPD, the ventilatory requirements of Wneg were considerably lower than those of Wpos at similar work loads up to 50 % of maximal work capacity. During Wneg, the ventilatory reserve was higher and gas exchange was less disturbed as a result of a lower V̇O 2 and V̇CO 2...|$|E
40|$|Cardiopulmonary {{exercise}} testing (CPX) is {{established for the}} investigation of cardiac disease. In patients with heart failure multiple variables have shown prognostic benefit, although peak VO 2 remains the most widely used. It is accepted that peak VO 2 is affected by respiratory disease as well, and may be highly susceptible to influence from respiratory disease coexistent with cardiac disease. I propose an alternative variable will show significantly greater specificity for cardiovascular disease when compared to peak VO 2 (and other variables) and aim to identify this “ideal” variable through the investigation of patients undergoing isolated cardiac interventions. Patients were recruited to the following groups: undergone/going cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT); heart failure; mitral valve surgery; COPD or mixed disease. Each patient underwent echocardiography, pulmonary function tests and blood sampling. They then performed (after an initial familiarisation CPX) a baseline CPX. In patients undergoing intervention (CRT and mitral surgery) they underwent another CPX 2 - 3 months after intervention, and a further CPX at 6 months in the mitral valve group. I assessed the following characteristics to aid in finding an ideal variable: ability to discriminate between heart and lung disease; high reproducibility; relation to exercise capacity and disease severity; and appropriate changes with physiological interventions. ROC curve analysis showed that <b>breathing</b> <b>reserve,</b> OUES and double product had the greatest areas under curve when differentiating COPD from heart failure. OUES also showed excellent test-retest reproducibility and was strongly correlated to disease severity. Following mitral surgery OUES fell less at 2 months than peak VO 2; OUES may therefore be influenced {{to a lesser degree}} by muscular maladaptation post-surgery. The ideal cardiopulmonary exercise test variable for cardiac patients has yet to be described. OUES appears to show discriminating properties between heart and lung, is reproducible and is less influenced by peripheral changes when compared to peak VO 2. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Ventilatory {{inefficiency}} increases ventilatory demand; {{corresponds to}} an abnor-mal {{increase in the}} ratio of minute ventilation (V ˙ E) to CO 2 production (V ˙ CO 2); represents increased dead space, deregulation of respiratory control, and early lactic threshold; and is associated with expiratory flow limitation that enhances dynamic hyperinflation and may limit exercise capacity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of ventilatory inefficiency over exercise capacity in COPD patients. METHODS: Prospective study of 35 COPD subjects with different levels of severity, in whom cardiopulmonary stress test was performed. Ventilatory inefficiency was represented by the V ˙ E/V ˙ CO 2 relation. Its influence over maximal oxygen consumption (V ˙ O 2 max), power (W), and ven-tilatory threshold was evaluated. Surrogate parameters of cardiac function, like oxygen pulse (V ˙ O 2 /heart rate) and circulatory power (%V ˙ O 2 max peak systolic pressure), were also evaluated. RESULTS: Cardiopulmonary stress test was stopped due to dyspnea with elevated V ˙ E and marked reduction of <b>breathing</b> <b>reserve.</b> A severe increase in V ˙ E/V ˙ CO 2 (mean SD 35. 9 5. 6), a decrease of V ˙ O 2 max (mean SD 75. 2 20 %), and a decrease of W (mean SD 68. 6 23. 3 %) were demonstrated. Twenty-eight patients presented dynamic hyperinflation. Linear regression showed a reduction of 2. 04 % on V ˙ O 2 max (P<. 001), 2. 6 % on W (P<. 001), 1 % on V ˙ O 2 /heart rate (P. 049), and 322. 7 units on circulatory power (P. 02) per each unit of increment in V ˙ E/V ˙ CO 2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ventilatory inefficiency correlates with a reduction in exercise capacity in COPD patients. Including this parameter {{in the evaluation of}} exercise limitation in this patient population may mean a contribution toward the understanding of its pathophysiology.

40|$|Surgical {{procedures}} {{among the}} aged have recently increased {{and the management}} {{is complicated by the}} problem that the incidence of postoperative complications and mortality in elderly patients are more frequent than young adults. Pulmonary complications have ranked first among postoperative disturbances and as a cause of mortality. Preoperative respiratory function and changes of acid-base balance and serum electrolytes during postoperative course were evaluated in elderly patients over 65 years of age in order to assure a smooth and uncomplicated surgical procedure. Poor pulmonary function as following pattern has been observed in the aged. Inspiratory and expiratory reserve volume, vital capacity, maximum breathing capacity and one second forced expiratory volume decreased with advancing age, while residual volume/total lung capacity ratio increased. <b>Breathing</b> <b>reserve</b> ratio slightly decreased. In mechanics of breathing considerable difference between static and dynamic compliance was noted. In exercise tolerance test increasing ratio of pulse and pressure, oximeter rate, and exercise index were elevated with decreasing tendency of oxygen removal ratio and ventilation index. These changes associated with aging appear to be due to diminished cardiopulmonary reserve. In changes of arterial blood determination pre- and postoperatively, predominant decrease of pH and the most elevated carbon dioxide tension immediately after operation were confirmed. Oxygen tension was reduced to postoperative 24 hours and followed general trend of delay in recovery. There was a negative level in base excess preoperatively in 38 per cent of patients, a marked metabolic acidosis was observed immediately following operation and evidence of metabolic acidosis still one week after surgery. Among changes of serum electrolytes, Na, K and Cl did not show significance with the analysis we used. Correlation studies illustrate some of the dysfunction with increasing age preoperatively, tendency of delay in recovery from operative procedure and serious potentialities of postoperative morbity and mortality. Preoperatively, elderly patients whose laboratory findings suggest a pulmonary abnormality must have their condition fully evaluated and treated before undergoing an operation. Adequate preoperative pulmonary preparation, proper ventilation or intensive pulmonary care may be considered to influence the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. Introduction: Exercise {{capacity}} is reduced in many patients with bronchiectasis, {{but there is}} little information available regarding exercise responses in these patients. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate exercise capacity and exercise responses in patients with bilateral bronchiectasis in order to identify possible exercise-limiting factors. Population and Methods: Fifteen patients with bronchiectasis aged 50 ± 16 years underwent lung function testing, including assessment of tidal expiratory flow limitation (EFL), and performed a maximum incremental (20 watts/min) symptom-limited bicycle exercise test. Results: Exercise performance was reduced in 7 of the 15 patients, particularly in those with a greater degree of impairment of lung function, and specifically lower FEV 1 (p< 0. 001) and FVC (p< 0. 001). EFL was detected in 5 of the 7 patients with exercise limitation and absent in all with normal exercise capacity. Patients with reduced exercise capacity exhibited significantly lower maximal ventilation (V. Emax %pred; p< 0. 001), maximal tidal volume (VTmax; p= 0. 03), <b>breathing</b> <b>reserve</b> (higher V. Emax/MVV; p< 0. 001), peak-exercise oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO 2, p< 0. 001), O 2 -pulse (p< 0. 001) and anaerobic threshold (AT, p< 0. 001) and perceived a higher degree of dyspnoea (Borg score; p= 0. 007). The best correlate of maximal work rate (WRmax, %pred) was the AT (r= 0. 90, r 2 = 0. 81, p< 0. 001), while for peak oxygen uptake (V. O 2 max, %pred) the most significant correlation was the peak-exercise SpO 2 (r= 0. 83, r 2 = 0. 69, p< 0. 001). Conclusions: Patients with bronchiectasis who have tidal EFL and a low FEV 1 exhibit a reduction in exercise capacity. Ventilatory limitation, desaturation and impaired O 2 -transport/utilization to the periphery appear to be the principal factors limiting exercise. V. O 2 max can be predicted accurately from parameters obtained by simple means, such as peak-exercise SpO 2 obtained by pulse oximetry. Pneumon 2009, 22 (4) : 296 - 314...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAnkylosing {{spondylitis}} (AS) {{has been}} shown to produce exercise limitation and breathlessness. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate factors which may be responsible for limiting aerobic capacity in patients with AS. Twenty patients with no other cardio-respiratory disease performed integrative cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). The results were compared to 20 age and gender matched healthy controls. Variables that might influence exercise tolerance, including pulmonary function tests (body plethysmography), respiratory muscle strength (MIP, MEP) and endurance (Tlim), AS severity assessment including chest expansion (CE), thoracolumber movement (TL), wall tragus distance and peripheral muscle strength assessed by maximum voluntary contraction of the knee extensors (Qds), hand grip strength and lean body mass (LBM), were measured in the patients with AS and used as explanatory variables against the peak V̇O 2 achieved during CPET. AS subjects achieved a lower peak V̇O 2 than controls (25 · 2 ± 1 · 4 vs. 33 · 1 ± 1 · 6 ml kg− 1 min− 1, mean ± sem, P= 0 · 001). When compared with controls, ventilatory response (V̇E/V̇CO 2) in AS was elevated (P= 0 · 01); however gas exchange indices, transcutaneous blood gases and <b>breathing</b> <b>reserve</b> were similar to controls. AS subjects developed a higher HR/V̇O 2 response (P< 0 · 01) on exertion but without associated abnormalities in ECG, blood pressure response or anaerobic threshold. The AS group experienced a greater degree of leg fatigue (P< 0 · 01) than controls at peak exercise. Although the breathlessness scores (BS) were comparable to controls at peak exercise, the slopes of the relationship between BS and work rate (WR) [AS 0 · 054 (0 · 1), Controls 0 · 043 (0 · 06); P< 0 · 05] and BS and % predicted oxygen uptake [AS 0 · 084 (0 · 18), Controls 0 · 045 (0 · 06); P< 0 · 01] were steeper in the AS subjects. There was weak association between peak V̇O 2 and vital capacity (r 2 % 12 · 0), MIP (11 · 8) but no association between Tlim, CE, Wall tragus distance or TL movement. The strongest association with aerobic capacity was between measurements of peripheral muscle strength (Qds; r= 0 · 75; hand grip; r= 0 · 47) accounting for 53 % (P< 0 · 001) and 23 · 5 % (P< 0 · 01) of the total variance in peak V̇O 2, respectively. The addition of LBM to Qds in the regression model significantly improved the explained variance to 78 · 3 % (P< 0 · 001). This study shows that peripheral muscle function is the most important determinant of exercise intolerance in AS patients suggesting that deconditioning is the main factor in the production of the reduced aerobic capacity...|$|E
40|$|Classifying 40 cardiac {{patients}} {{into various}} groups, and besides judging subjective and objective findings, the respiratory function tests were performed {{in each group}} of slight, moderate and severe degree, Gaensler 2 ̆ 7 s 1 st and milder cases within the 2 nd group corresponded to the slight group, the 2 nd and milder cases within the 3 rd group to the moderate group, the 3 rd and the 4 th group to the severe group respectively. With due regard to the all clinical states, the mode of response caused by the administration of drugs were classified into the effective, unchanged and exacerbated. 7 cases with pulmonary emphysema, 5 with bronchial asthma, and one with hyperthyrosis were compared and contrasted with cardiac patients. In order to study the influence of postural change upon respiratory function, lung- and ventilation volumes were measured in lying and standing positions, and as circumstances require, also in sitting, with special reference to the relationship to circulatory dynamical factors. 1. The tidal volume of cardiac patients was in general found {{less than that of}} normal health, provided that in bronchospasm, cor pulmonale, pulmonary emphysema and bronchial asthma the tidal volumes were commonly determined larger than those in normal health. The patients with rales in any of groups tended to have the small tidal volume. 2. The respiratory minute volume in bronchial asthma was a little on the average, whereas in cardiac disorders it was rather larger than that in normal health. Expressly, in lying the patients with hyperthyrosis, auricular fibrillation and bronchospasm, and in standing, the patients with pulmonary emphysema, cor pulmonale and cardiogenic bronchospasm tended to show the higher R. M. V. than those of normal subjects. 3. The inspiratory capacities in pulmonary emphysema, cor pulmonale and bronchial asthma were used to be found within normal range both in lying and standing, while those capacities in cardiac disorders were often observed less than that in normal health. Especially, the cases with rales showed the low value. 4. The expiratory reserve volumes in pulmo-cardiac diseases were estimated subnormally, whereas those in cor pulmonale, pulmonary emphysema and bronchial asthma were relatively higher than those in cardiac diseases on the average. The cases with rales showed occasionally the marked low value. 5. The vital capacity in any group of cardiac diseases was measured less than that in normal health. V. C. in pulmonary emphysema, bronchial asthma existed usually with normal range. The patients suffered from rales showed frequently the very low value. 6. The maximal breathing capacity in any group of diseases observed here, especially in cardiogenic bronchospasm or cor pulmonale was determined less than that in normal health, whereas the left ventricular failure showed not so marked decrease on the average. M. B. C. of the cases with rales were commonly estimated low. 7. While the air velocity index in hyperthyrosis or auricular fibrillation was found longer than 1. 0, in the other groups of diseases, particularly in cardiogenic bronchospasm, pulmonary emphysema and bronchial asthma A.

40|$|Currently, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) {{recommends}} that protocols for cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) should last between eight and twelve minutes. However, {{the justification for}} these exercise durations rely on limited experimental data. These recommendations {{have a significant impact}} on the ability of frail patients to be assessed using CPET and should conform to evidence based practice. This thesis begins by assessing the validity of these recommendations in relation to maximal exercise responses before assessing the consequences of these recommendations on sub-maximal exercise measurements. These studies were conducted in a relatively large cohort (compared to the study that underpins the ACSM guidelines) of heterogeneous volunteers (they are both men and women, with a significant age range and varied functional capacity) to make the data more relevant to clinical exercise testing. The data presented in chapter three demonstrate that it is very difficult to obtain exercise duration conforming to the current ACSM guidelines by using a standardised ramp exercise protocol on both treadmill and cycle ergometer exercise. However, sub-group analyses for those subjects who achieved moderate (8 - 12 minutes) and short (less than 8 minutes) exercise durations. In addition, a separate analysis was carried out for a different sub-group of those who achieved moderate (8 - 12 minutes) and long (more than 12 minutes) of durations of exercise. Despite this, it was possible to demonstrate in sub-group analysis that there was no significant difference in peak oxygen uptake, peak carbon dioxide output, peak heart rate, peak ventilation and peak power output when exercise duration was less or more than that prescribed by the ACSM recommendations. In addition, the effects of long, moderate or short duration exercise per se were also analysed in this chapter and again exercise duration was shown to be without effect on the main maximal markers of exercise performance. In chapters four, five and six, the initial findings were extended to determine the effects of exercise duration on a range of clinically relevant sub-maximal markers of exercise performance. It was likely, since exercise duration did not affect maximal exercise that the physiological determinants of maximal performance were not significantly altered during short or long duration exercise and consequently it was likely that sub-maximal markers of functional capacity would not be affected. However, the quality of the data obtained during CPET can obviously influence the accurate measurement physiological responses during exercise and much of the analysis in these chapters focused on the validity of the data analysis. Chapter four investigated the limitations to measuring the break point in the relationship between oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide output during progressive exercise (the so called ventilatory threshold or ‘V-slope’). The accurate measurement of this break point was determined by standard gas exchange criteria and the effects of reducing the data available for analysis (by reducing the amount of breaths available for comparison at reduced exercise durations) were examined. The data showed that reducing the data available for analysis had an impact on the quality of the data (decreasing the goodness of fit) but no significant effect on the determination of the ventilatory threshold. Chapter five determined the effects of exercise duration on the oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES). As expected, the effects of exercise duration were not significant but additional investigation into the commonly employed data analysis procedures was performed. These data show that the log transformation of the relationship between ventilation and oxygen uptake allows reliable assessment of ventilatory efficiency in most cases, however, the impact of the lactate threshold on ventilation and the biological variability in where the threshold occurs as a proportion of functional capacity can impact on the sensitivity of this measurement to predict aerobic and/or anaerobic capacity. Chapter six determined the effects of exercise duration on the <b>breathing</b> <b>reserve</b> index and found no significant difference during short, moderate or long exercise duration exercise. Further analysis was performed to demonstrate limitations in the use of predicted maximum voluntary ventilation (rather than direct measurement). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the current ACSM recommendations for CPET are too restrictive and may limit the application of such testing in populations that cannot exercise for between eight and twelve minutes. The data further suggest that the testing and analysis procedures used during CPET are central to producing valid maximal and sub-maximal markers of functional capacity and the recommendations should focus include guidelines in relation to such aspects...|$|E
