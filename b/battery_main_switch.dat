In this paper, the research on the electromagnetic radiation characteristic of the gas <b>main</b> <b>switch</b> of a capacitive IEBA is carried out by the methods of theory analysis and experiment investigation. It is obtained that the gas <b>main</b> <b>switch</b> is the dominating radiation resource. In the absence of electromagnetic shielding for the gas <b>main</b> <b>switch,</b> when the pulse forming line of the IEBA is charged to 700 kV, the radiation field with amplitude of 3280 V/m, dominant frequency of 84 MHz and high frequency 100 MHz is obtained at a distance of 10 meters away from the gas <b>main</b> <b>switch.</b> The experimental results of the radiation field agree with the theoretical calculations.

40|$|A novel {{technique}} for efficiently extracting the maximum output power from a solar panel under varying meteorological conditions is presented. The methodology {{is based on}} connecting a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) dc/dc SEPIC or Cuk converter between a solar panel and a load or battery bus. The converter operates in discontinuous capacitor voltage mode whilst its input current is continuous. By modulating a small-signal sinusoidal perturbation into the duty cycle of the <b>main</b> <b>switch</b> and comparing the maximum variation in the input voltage and the voltage stress of the <b>main</b> <b>switch,</b> the maximum power point (MPP) of the panel can be located. The nominal duty cycle of the <b>main</b> <b>switch</b> in the converter is adjusted to a value, so that the input resistance of the converter {{is equal to the}} equivalent output resistance of the solar panel at the MPP. This approach ensures maximum power transfer under all conditions without using microprocessors for calculation. Detailed mathematical derivations of the MPP tracking technique are included. The tracking capability of the proposed technique has been verified experimentally with a 10 -W solar panel at different insolation (incident solar radiation) levels and under large-signal insolation level changes. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
