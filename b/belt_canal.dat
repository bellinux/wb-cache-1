40|$|The {{subsurface}} in the Western {{part of the}} Netherlands {{is generally}} characterized as a regional aquifer, in {{which most of the}} lateral groundwater flow takes place, covered by a semi-permeable layer. The semi-permeable layer is often split into a phreatic layer on top of an aquitard (which has an even lower permeability). The phreatic layer and aquitard together are referred to as the top-system. The phreatic layer contains ditches and drains that transport excess water out of the area to, for example, a <b>belt</b> <b>canal</b> or a river. In regional groundwater models upscaling methods are applied to replace the top-system by a linear head-flux relationship (a Cauchy boundary condition) {{to take into account the}} interaction between many small surface water features and the groundwater in a lumped fashion. The upscaled system contains two parameters: the effective water level (p*) and the effective resistance (c*). The geology of the phreatic layer has a large influence on the value of these parameters, but existing upscaling methods are limited to homogeneous and isotropic phreatic layers. New formulas are derived for the effective parameters that take into account layered heterogeneity and vertical anisotropy. This multi-layer upscaling method is compared to an existing method, derived by de Lange, “A Cauchy boundary condition for the lumped interaction between an arbitrary number of surface waters and a regional aquifer”, Journal of Hydrology 266 (1999) (p. 250 - 261), which does not incorporate these aspects directly. Two upscaled models are created using the two upscaling methods and are compared to an analytic element model containing all features explicitly. The comparison is carried out for a cross-section with an extraction in the regional aquifer. In homogeneous isotropic phreatic layers both upscaling methods perform well. The drawdown in the regional aquifer differs by less than 3 % as compared to the drawdown in the explicit model. When heterogeneity and anisotropy are introduced to the phreatic layer, the multi-layer method performs better with differences in drawdown remaining below 1 %. The method by de Lange shows differences of up to 15 %. The values of the effective parameters calculated by both models are similar in heterogeneous top-systems characterized by larger phreatic transmissivities, although the multi-layer method is almost always more accurate. For phreatic layers with smaller transmissivities, the multi-layer method yields significantly better estimates for the effective parameters. The new method does have limitations. It is less accurate in situations where surface water features are wide relative to the distance between them or when the bed resistance of the surface water features is large relative to the resistance of the aquitard. De Lange's approach is, in theory, applicable under those conditions, but does not take into account heterogeneity or vertical anisotropy. For most practical purposes, the multi-layer upscaling method is preferred and yields similar or more accurate results than de Lange's method.

50|$|Brouwersgracht is a canal in {{the city}} centre of Amsterdam and {{is part of the}} <b>canal</b> <b>belt</b> {{connecting}} the Singel, Herengracht, Keizergracht and Prinsengracht and marks the northern border of the <b>canal</b> <b>belt.</b> The <b>canal</b> served as a site for ships returning from Asia with spices and silks, therefore Brouwersgracht had many warehouses and storage depots for the ships inventories. Likewise some officials of the Dutch East India Company lived here such as their cartographer (1708-1743) Isaak de Graaf. Breweries were also prevalent in the area due to the access to fresh water shipments. Today the warehouses are now apartments, some of the most expensive in Amsterdam. Houseboats also are seen in the canal. In 2007, Brouwersgracht was voted the most beautiful street in Amsterdam by readers of Het Parool, a national daily newspaper.|$|R
50|$|The eastern city {{expansion}} {{beyond the}} 17th-century Amsterdam <b>canal</b> <b>belt</b> {{began in the}} last quarter of the 19th century with the development of the Oosterparkbuurt and Dapperbuurt.

5000|$|In 1585, {{the city}} {{government}} decided to construct new earthen walls with 11 bastions beyond the existing walls. The city was expanding so rapidly that the area between {{the old and new}} walls was filled with new houses within {{a matter of a few}} years. In 1613 it was decided to construct new defensive walls with bastions on the western side of town, along the current Marnixstraat and Weteringschans streets, with a new outer moat (the Buitensingel, now Singelgracht) and inner moat (the [...] ). Within these new walls, the grachtengordel (the concentric <b>belt</b> of <b>canals)</b> could now be constructed.|$|R
50|$|The Bloemenmarkt is the world's only {{floating}} flower market. Founded in 1862, it is sited in Amsterdam, Netherlands, on Singel between Muntplein and Koningsplein in the city's southern <b>canal</b> <b>belt.</b> It includes 15 florists {{and garden}} shops {{as well as}} a range of souvenir gifts.

50|$|In 1901, the {{streetcar}} company slightly extended the Canal and Esplanade Lines {{so that their}} outer ends met at City Park Ave., and connected them together in a <b>Belt</b> Line. <b>Canal</b> cars left the central business district on Canal Street, operated to City Park Ave., turned down that street to Esplanade Ave., and returned on Esplanade to Rampart and thus back to Canal Street. Cars marked Esplanade left the central business district via Rampart Street down to Esplanade, then operated out Esplanade to City Park Ave. to Canal, and returned on <b>Canal</b> Street. This <b>Belt</b> Line arrangement lasted until December 27, 1934, when Esplanade Ave. was converted to buses, and Canal resumed running only on Canal Street, end-to-end.|$|R
5000|$|Until 1663 Herengracht reached {{as far as}} {{the present}} Leidsegracht. From that year on, the fortifications around Amsterdam were expanded, within Herengracht, Keizersgracht and Prinsengracht were extended. The digging ended at the river Amstel within a few years. The buyers on Herengracht were {{encouraged}} to buy two lots and built double-wide mansions, and because the three canals here were laid out a little further from each other, and the lots were also deeper. On these large lots, the well-to-do placed their city-palaces with classicist facades, stuccoed ceilings, and fine gardens, once a year open to the public. In the curve, by the Nieuwe Spiegelstraat, lived Amsterdam's richest citizens, and so this part of the <b>belt</b> of <b>canals</b> was named the [...] "Golden Bend" [...] in recent history.|$|R
5000|$|Amsterdam-Centrum is the inner-most borough and {{historical}} city centre of Amsterdam, containing {{the majority of}} the city's landmarks. Established in 2002, Amsterdam-Centrum was the last area in the city to be granted the status of self-governing borough. The borough is only 8.04 km2 large and covers the old innercity and the UNESCO-listed Amsterdam <b>canal</b> <b>belt.</b> In 2013, the borough had approximately 85,000 inhabitants, who on average had the second-highest income per household in the city and one of the highest in the country.|$|R
50|$|The Singelgracht canal {{had been}} Amsterdam's city border since the 17th century, when the Amsterdam <b>canal</b> <b>belt</b> was constructed. The taking {{down of the}} wall {{surrounding}} the Singelgracht, the outer canal, {{in the second half}} of the 19th century allowed for the development of new residential areas. South of the former wall, the first neighborhoods to develop were the Oude Pijp neighborhood, the neighborhood surrounding the Rijksmuseum, and the Willemspark neighborhood. This area is now also known as Oud Zuid ('Old South').|$|R

50|$|In 1859, {{after the}} company had failed and had passed into receivership, Alfred Smith {{purchased}} at auction its hydraulic system, consisting of the dam, its gate houses, and 2.5 mi of power canals with a boat lock; some 1100 acre of land in Holyoke containing mills and other buildings; and the public water supply reservoir and gas plant, each with a distribution system. He formed the Holyoke Water Power Company and sold stock to investors. Over the next 30 years the company flourished, {{as a number of}} large mills were built in the area. Energy was transmitted from the waterwheels to mills via a distribution system of gears, shafts, pulleys, and <b>belts.</b> The <b>canals</b> first produced municipal electricity on October 14, 1884, from an electric generator connected to a water wheel-driven shafting in an industrial building. In 1888 this was replaced by a combination hydro and steam electric power plant on the First Level Canal.|$|R
25|$|The city of Amsterdam is a {{municipality}} {{under the}} Dutch Municipalities Act. It {{is governed by}} a directly elected municipal council, a municipal executive board and a mayor. Since 1981, the municipality of Amsterdam has gradually been divided into semi-autonomous boroughs, called stadsdelen or 'districts'. Over time, a total of 15 boroughs were created. In May 2010, under a major reform, the number of Amsterdam boroughs was reduced to eight: Amsterdam-Centrum covering the city centre including the <b>canal</b> <b>belt,</b> Amsterdam-Noord consisting of the neighbourhoods north of the IJ lake, Amsterdam-Oost in the east, Amsterdam-Zuid in the south, Amsterdam-West in the west, Amsterdam Nieuw-West in the far west, Amsterdam Zuidoost in the southeast, and Westpoort covering the Port of Amsterdam area.|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{fact that}} many common work {{practices}} involve collaboration is driving the need for interfaces that enable sharing of digital information among groups of people. Since traditional tables naturally support group work, digital tabletop displays offer a great potential for the design and development of collaborative interfaces that provide access to digital information and media in a natural and intuitive way [Scott et al. 2003]. In addition to facilitating information sharing, interfaces for large displays should also support the creative flow that emerges during group meetings. However, problems relating to reaching items {{at the far side}} of the display, supporting mobility of people, and sharing and passing of digital information still need to be addressed.

5000|$|The {{borough of}} Amsterdam-West {{consists}} primarily of the pre-World War II part of Amsterdam {{to the west}} of the Singelgracht canal. The western expansion beyond the 17th-century Amsterdam <b>canal</b> <b>belt</b> started in the last quarter of the 19th century. The first neighborhoods to be built were Spaarndammerbuurt, parts of Zeeheldenbuurt, Staatsliedenbuurt, Kinkerbuurt and Overtoombuurt. These neighborhoods are characterised by revolutiebouw (literally: 'revolution architecture'): quickly and cheaply constructed 19th-century apartment blocks for worker's and middle-class families once considered of substandard quality, but currently in high demand for their charming, urban outlook. Neighbouring areas constructed in the early twentieth century such as Frederik Hendrikbuurt, which borders the Frederik Hendrikplantsoen park tend to be less densely populated and are characterised by the Amsterdam School of architecture contemporary with Art Nouveau and designed to create a total architectural experience, interior and exterior. Between 1990 and 2010, these neighborhoods formed the boroughs of Westerpark and Oud-West.|$|R
50|$|When {{the first}} {{owner of the}} house had more houses built by the same {{carpenter}} or contractor and using the same or mirrored design these are called twin or triplet houses. There are even sets {{of four or five}} identically designed houses. In those case the houses will be smaller than a normal house (as three houses were built on two land lot). The width of a canal house and the depth of its garden varies a lot. (This is because the land lots in the 17th century started from 18 Amsterdam feet (an Amsterdam foot being 28.13 cm) but then went to 20, 22, 24 and 26 feet.)Along the canals in Amsterdam are also double wide houses, especially along the Herengracht. These mansions were built on two land lots, a back house was not needed. Wide houses nearly always have steps on both sides. At Herengracht 386, the museum Het Grachtenhuis (The Canal House) is located, which {{tells the story of the}} Amsterdam <b>canal</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the city of Amsterdam grew quickly as a result of the {{industrial}} revolution taking place in the Netherlands. Between 1870 and 1900, the city's population almost doubled and at the turn of the century, the number of 500,000 inhabitants was reached. Many of the old innercity neighbourhoods had become overcrowded and were suffering from poor living conditions and a lack of sanitary facilities. The last major development had been the construction of the Amsterdam <b>canal</b> <b>belt</b> in the 17th century. To allow the city to expand beyond the canal ring, the wall surrounding it was taken down in stages during {{the second half}} of the 19th century. Several new residential areas were being developed, with upscale residences being built around the just-opened Rijksmuseum and workers' and middle-class homes the west and east of the old city, for example in areas now called Oud-West and Oud-Oost.|$|R
2500|$|The {{result of}} {{worsening}} trade prospects between 1621 and 1663 was declining profitability, leading to reorientation of investment flows during this period. There was now much more investment in infrastructure, like the trekvaarten, an extensive system of canals {{that formed the}} basis of a sophisticated public transportation system, based on trekschuiten or horse-drawn boats (later emulated during the industrial revolution in the British canal system and the Erie Canal in the U.S.). This was also a period of major land reclamation projects, the droogmakerijen of inland lakes like Beemster and Schermer that were drained by windmills and converted to polders. In this way appreciable areas of fertile arable land were gained, reversing the trend of the 15th and 16th centuries. Finally, there was a tremendous boom in real estate investment, ranging from the extensions of cities like Amsterdam (where the famous <b>canal</b> <b>belts</b> were built) to harbor improvements and fortifications. The total urban population was nearly doubled in the century after 1580, necessitating a commensurate boom in urban construction, which by 1640 assumed the proportions of a speculative [...] "bubble".|$|R
40|$|In {{the coming}} years Amsterdam is facing an influx of people {{over the age of}} 65. This influx will be the most present in the Center and South districts of the city, districts that are known for their pre-war {{buildings}}. These buildings often lack mobility and accessibility needs for this target group. Suitable alternatives for people over the age of 65 with financial means that are currently living in the city center in canal houses are almost none existing. Therefor a new alternative for these ‘golden agers’ is desired. The project site is situated on the boundary of the old city center in a transition zone between the <b>canal</b> <b>belt</b> and 19 th century expansion. The site, also know as the Applemarket, is a rare void in a dense city center area in which renewal of the current buildings almost never takes place. Therefor it makes it a great location for dwellings that suit the needs of this target group. Due to the lack of recreational green in the city center of Amsterdam and to counter the ambition of Amsterdam to densify the city, the site is approached as an open green space in which three buildings ‘land’. The Breaburn Ensemble is a composition of three buildings that occupy a small portion of this green space. Each building incorporates the green character of the site in a distinct way so it becomes part of the living quality of the individual dwellings. Also, public health & care related functions {{on the ground floor of}} each building are integrated. Carefully designed floorplans offer the resident a level of luxury and living space they were used to and feature state of the art technical elements for comfort. The Breaburn Ensemble is an all in one concept for golden agers set in familiar surroundings in a new green heart of the city...|$|R
