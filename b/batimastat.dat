50|$|<b>Batimastat</b> (INN/USAN, codenamed BB-94) is an anticancer {{drug that}} belongs {{to the family of}} drugs called {{angiogenesis}} inhibitors. It acts as a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (MMPI) by mimicking natural MMPI peptides.|$|E
50|$|Some {{examples}} of exopeptidase inhibitors include amastatin, bestatin (ubenimex), puromycin, 1,10-phenanthroline, D-phenylalanine, ACE inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, and exogenous MMP inhibitors like <b>batimastat</b> and marimastat. Various enkephalinase inhibitors, such as ketalorphan, spinorphin, and tynorphin, are mainly exopeptidase inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Batimastat</b> was {{the first}} MMPI that went into {{clinical}} trials. First results of a Phase I trial appeared in 1994. The drug reached Phase III but was never marketed; mainly because it couldn't be administered orally (as opposed to the newer and chemically similar MMPI marimastat), and injection into the peritoneum caused peritonitis.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} of MMP inhibitors {{were based on the}} structure of the collagen molecule. This group of inhibitors contain a hydroxamate (-CONHOH) group that binds the zinc atom in the active site of the MMP enzyme. The first MMP inhibitors that were tested in patients were Ilomastat and <b>Batimastat,</b> hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitors. However, neither compound showed good oral bioavailability.Thus far, Periostat (active ingredient is doxycycline hyclate) is the only MMP inhibitor that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is used for the treatment of periodontitis. Other MMP inhibitors have exhibited serious side effects during preclinical trials. These side effects are caused by insufficient selectivity. Most MMP inhibitors are unable to target specific MMPs connected to specific pathological conditions. Instead, they inhibit multiple MMPs, some of which have protective functions or are not related to pathology.MMPs have been regarded as promising targets for cancer therapy. Preclinical studies investigating the efficacy of MMP suppression in tumor models were encouraging. Following these results, clinical studies were conducted but turned out to be disappointing. Recent studies have shown that MMPs may even have paradoxical roles in tumor progression. MMPs seem to have tumor-promoting effects as well as tumor suppressive effects dependent on different contexts.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{generation}} of MMP inhibitors {{were based on the}} structure of the collagen molecule. In the design of these inhibitors, the basic protein backbone of collagen is maintained but the amide bond is replaced with a zinc-binding group. This group of inhibitors contain a hydroxamate (-CONHOH) group that binds the zinc atom in the active site of the MMP enzyme, therefore this group is called [...] "hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitors“. An example can be seen in Marimastat, a {{first generation}} inhibitor, which has a similar backbone and sidechain format to collagen.Ilomastat and <b>batimastat</b> were the first two MMP inhibitors to be tested in patients. These are both hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitors and have similar overall structures.The hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitors display an excellent anticancer activity in tumor cells but the clinical performances of these compounds were disappointing. A factor contributing to this disappointment was that they are broad-spectrum inhibitors of many MMP sub-types that can in many cases also inhibit members of the ADAMs protease family. When they were tested in patients they induced dose-limiting muscular and skeletal pain in a number of the patients. Only when the structures of the MMP inhibitors could be adjusted to impart selectivity and abolish toxicity, would they achieve clinical impact in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E

40|$|Chronic hypoxia induces lung {{vascular}} remodeling, {{which results}} in pulmonary hypertension. We hypothesized that a previously found increase in collagenolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinases during hypoxia promotes pulmonary vascular remodeling and hypertension. To test this hypothesis, rats were exposed to hypoxia (FIO 2 = 0. 1; 3 weeks) and treated with a metalloproteinase inhibitor, <b>Batimastat</b> (30 mg/kg body weight, daily IP injection). Hypoxia-induced increases in concentration of collagen breakdown products and in collagenolytic activity in pulmonary vessels were inhibited by <b>Batimastat,</b> attesting {{to the effectiveness of}} <b>Batimastat</b> administration. <b>Batimastat</b> markedly reduced hypoxic pulmonary hypertension: pulmonary arterial blood pressure was 32 ± 3 mmHg in hypoxic controls, 24 ± 1 mmHg in Batimastat-treated hypoxic rats, and 16 ± 1 mmHg in normoxic controls. Right ventricular hypertrophy and muscularization of peripheral lung vessels were also diminished. <b>Batimastat</b> had no influence on systemic arterial pressure or cardiac output and was without any effect in rats kept in normoxia.

With a challenge dose of three LD 50 s, lethality was not abrogated, but a conspicuous and dose-dependent delay in the time of death was observed in mice injected with mixtures of venom plus <b>batimastat.</b> Upon incubation with 500 μM <b>batimastat,</b> venom LD 50 increased 2. 86 -fold (intraperitoneal route) and 2. 37 -fold (intravenous route), when compared with LD 50 of venom alone. <b>Batimastat</b> also inhibited the hemorrhagic effect induced by venom in the lungs after intravenous injection. Moreover, <b>batimastat</b> exerted a significant inhibition of in vitro coagulant and in vivo defibrinogenating effects of venom, evidencing that metalloproteinases {{play a key role in}} the coagulopathy characteristic of B. asper envenomation. The remaining uninhibited coagulant effect is due to serine proteinases, i. e. thrombin-like enzymes, since this effect was completely abrogated by the combination of <b>batimastat</b> and PMSF. Our results stress the view that metalloproteinases play a relevant role in the systemic pathophysiology of B. asper envenomation and that metalloproteinase inhibitors may become a therapeutic alternative in this pathology.

40|$|<b>Batimastat</b> (BB- 94), a {{synthetic}} hydroxamate peptidomimetic matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, was tested {{for its ability}} to inhibit proteolytic and toxic effects induced by BaP 1, a 24 -kDa hemorrhagic metalloproteinase isolated from the venom of Bothrops asper, the medically most important snake species in Central America and southern Mexico. <b>Batimastat</b> inhibited proteolytic activity on biotinylated casein, with anic 50 of 80 nM. In addition, <b>batimastat</b> was effective in inhibiting hemorrhagic, dermonecrotic, and edema-forming activities of this metalloproteinase if incubated with the enzyme prior to the assays. When the inhibitor was administered i. m. {{at the site of the}} toxin injection without preincubation, rapidly after metalloproteinase administration, it totally abrogated the hemorrhagic and dermonecrotic effects of BaP 1. Inhibition was less effective as the time lapse between toxin and <b>batimastat</b> injection increased, due to the extremely rapid development of BaP 1 -induced local tissue damage in this experimental model. On the other hand, <b>batimastat</b> was ineffective if administered by the i. p. route immediately after toxin injection.

40|$|The matrix {{metalloprotease}} (MMP) {{family of}} enzymes and the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) pathway {{have both been}} implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis and in poor prognosis of cancer. We have previously shown that treatment with <b>batimastat,</b> a synthetic MMP inhibitor, leads to significant retardation but not regression of tumor growth in a human breast cancer xenograft model. In addition, <b>batimastat</b> treatment did not inhibit local tumor invasion, nor did it encourage stromal encapsulation of the tumor, suggesting the additional involvement of non-MMP proteolytic mechanisms. To investigate {{the presence of an}} alternative extracellular matrix protease whose activity is known to be important in breast cancer, but which is not inhibited by <b>batimastat,</b> expression of murine and human uPA were examined by in situ hybridization and ELISA. No differences were observed between untreated and batimastat-treated tumors regarding human uPA mRNA and protein. In contrast, murine uPA mRNA expression was increased at the tumor-stromal junction in batimastat-treated tumors in comparison with the control tumors. In agreement with these results, <b>batimastat</b> treatment was shown to significantly induce murine uPA protein content in the tumors. Inoculating MDA 435 /LCC- 6 cells into immunodeficient, uPA-deficient mice resulted in tumor growth retardation as compared to tumor growth in littermate wild-type controls, while addition of <b>batimastat</b> treatment to uPA-/- mice did not result in further growth inhibition. The increased expression of stromal uPA may represent a cellular response to MMP inhibition and may demonstrate a new level of plasticity in the malignant progression of the disease.

40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD), caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, involves severe muscle degeneration, inflammation, fibrosis, and early death in afflicted boys. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are extracellular proteases that cause tissue degradation in several disease states. In this study, {{we tested the}} hypothesis that the expression levels of various MMPs are abnormally increased and that their inhibition will ameliorate muscle pathogenesis in animal models of DMD. Our results show that the transcript levels of several MMPs are significantly up-regulated, whereas tissue inhibitors of MMPs are down-regulated, in dystrophic muscle of mdx mice. Chronic administration of <b>batimastat</b> (BB- 94), a broad spectrum peptide inhibitor of MMPs, reduced necrosis, infiltration of macrophages, centronucleated fibers, and the expression of embryonic myosin heavy chain in skeletal muscle of mdx mice. <b>Batimastat</b> also reduced the expression of several inflammatory molecules and augmented the levels of sarcolemmal protein β-dystroglycan and neuronal nitric oxide in mdx mice.

40|$|Abstract. The {{effectiveness}} of the chelating agent CaNa 2 EDTA and the peptidomimetic matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor <b>batimastat</b> (BB- 94) to inhibit local tissue damage induced by Bothrops asper snake venom was studied in mice. Both compounds totally inhibited proteolytic, hemorrhagic, and dermonecrotic effects, and partially reduced edema-forming activity, when incubated with venom prior to injection. Much lower concentrations of <b>batimastat</b> than of CaNa 2 EDTA were required to inhibit these effects. In addition, <b>batimastat,</b> but not CaNa 2 EDTA, partially reduced myotoxic activity of the venom. When the inhibitors were administered at various time intervals after envenomation at the same site of venom injection, both compounds were effective in neutralizing local hemorrhage and dermone-crosis if administered rapidly after venom.

40|$|AbstractTyrosine kinases {{belonging}} to the discoidin domain receptor (DDR) family are activated upon stimulation with various types of collagen.

Here, this protein is identified as C-terminal cleavage product of the full-length DDR 1 receptor and a DDR 1 -specific shedding enzyme postulated. Shedding of DDR 1 can be partially blocked by the furin inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone and completely inhibited by the hydroxamate-based inhibitor <b>batimastat.</b> The characteristic of the DDR 1 sheddase to be blocked by <b>batimastat</b> suggests that {{it belongs to the}} membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase or disintegrin and metalloproteinase family of proteases...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to perform a more detailed evaluation of the characteristics of SCLs, and to elucidate the role of the increased expression of MMP- 14 expression in the growth and death of these cells. In order to elucidate the characteristics of SCLs and to confirm the protein expression of MMP- 14, three-dimentional culture, invasion assays, a Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical studies were performed. To examine the role of MMP- 14 in tumorigenesis, the metalloproteinase inhibitor, <b>batimastat,</b> was administered to SCID mice which were subcutaneously injected with SCLs.

40|$|TNF-α {{activates}} multiple mitogen-activated {{protein kinase}} (MAPK) cascades in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) {{leading to the}} secretion of interleukin 8 (IL- 8), a neutrophil chemoattractant and an angiogenic factor with tumor promoting properties. As the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a known transducer of proliferative signals and a potent activator of MAPKs, we hypothesized that the EGFR participates in TNF-dependent MAPK activation and IL- 8 secretion by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). We show that the EGFR is tyrosine-phosphorylated following treatment of IECs (HT- 29 and IEC- 6) with TNF-α. This requires EGFR autophosphorylation as it was blocked by the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG 1478. Autophosphorylation was also inhibited by both a Src-kinase inhibitor and the metalloproteinase inhibitor <b>batimastat.</b> TNF treatment of IECs resulted in the accumulation of soluble TGF-α; treatment of IECs with <b>batimastat</b> suppressed TGF-α release and immunoneutralization of TGF-α resulted in decreased EGFR and ERK phosphorylations.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are cytotoxic. The responsible mechanisms, however, are not well understood. MMPs may promote cytotoxicity through their ability to disrupt or degrade matrix proteins that support cell survival, and MMPs may also cleave substrates to generate molecules that stimulate cell death. In addition, MMPs may themselves act on cell surface receptors that affect cell survival. Among such receptors is the alpha(2) beta(1) integrin, a complex that has previously been linked to leukocyte death. In the present study we show that human neurons express alpha(2) beta(1) and that pro-MMP- 1 interacts with this integrin complex. We also show that stimulation of neuronal cultures with MMP- 1 is associated with a rapid reduction in the phosphorylation of Akt, a kinase that can influence caspase activity and cell survival. Moreover, MMP- 1 -associated dephosphorylation of Akt is inhibited by a blocking antibody to the alpha(2) integrin, but not by <b>batimastat,</b> an inhibitor of MMP- 1 enzymatic activity. Such dephosphorylation is also stimulated by a catalytic mutant of pro-MMP- 1. Additional studies show that MMP- 1 causes neuronal death, which is significantly diminished by both a general caspase inhibitor and anti-alpha(2) but not by <b>batimastat.</b> Together, these results suggest that MMP- 1 can stimulate dephosphorylation of Akt and neuronal death through a non-proteolytic mechanism that involves changes in integrin signaling...|$|E

While most of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) {{have been shown to be}} produced by stromal cells, tumor cells such as MCF 7 cells are unable to produce MMPs. We therefore, hypothesized that the tumor-promoting effect of fibroblasts could be related to their production of MMPs. In order to inhibit stromal proteases, over-production of TIMP- 2 was induced in MCF 7 cells by in vitro retroviral-mediated gene transfer. TIMP- 2 -producing MCF 7 cells were then co-injected with fibroblasts into nude mice. Alternatively, we evaluated the effect of <b>Batimastat,</b> a synthetic inhibitor of MMPs, on the tumorigenicity of MCF 7 cells co-inoculated with fibroblasts into nude mice. Both physiological (TIMP- 2) and synthetic (<b>Batimastat)</b> inhibitors of MMPs were able to abolish the tumor-promoting effect of fibroblasts. On the contrary, they failed to modulate the tumorigenicity of MCF 7 cells injected alone. Interestingly, Matrigel from which low-molecular-weight proteins or growth factors had been removed failed to favor the tumorigenicity of MCF 7 cells inoculated with fibroblasts. These findings emphasize the importance of fibroblasts in cancer progression, and suggest that their role could be related at least in part to production of proteases which can induce the release of factors from the extracellular matrix.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Constrictive {{vascular}} remodeling (VR) is {{the most}} significant component of restenosis after balloon angioplasty (PTA). Whereas in physiological conditions VR is associated with normalization of shear stress (SS) and wall stress (WS), after PTA the role of SS and WS in VR is unknown. Furthermore, whereas matrix metalloproteinase inhibition (MMPI) has been shown to modulate VR after PTA, its effect on the SS and WS control mechanisms after PTA is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: PTA was performed in external iliac arteries of 12 atherosclerotic Yucatan pigs, of which 6 pigs (7 vessels) received the MMPI <b>batimastat</b> and 6 pigs (10 vessels) served as controls. Before and after the intervention and at 6 -week follow-up, intravascular ultrasound pullback was performed, allowing 3 D reconstruction of the treated segment and computational fluid dynamics to calculate the media-bounded area and SS. WS was derived from the Laplace formula. Immediately after PTA, media-bounded area, WS, and SS changed by 20 %, 16 %, and - 49 %, respectively, in both groups. VR was predicted by SS and WS. In the control group, SS and WS had been normalized at follow-up with respect to the reference segment. In contrast, for the <b>batimastat</b> group, the SS had been normalized, but not the WS. The latter is attributed to an increase in wall area at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular remodeling after PTA is controlled by both SS and WS. MMPI inhibited the WS control system...|$|E

Electron microscopy showed degradation of the Matrigel ® layer when eosinophils, added to the upper chamber, transmigrated the membrane {{in the presence of}} both platelet-activating factor (PAF) in the lower chamber and interleukin (IL) - 5 in both chambers. In the absence of either or both PAF and IL- 5, no changes occurred in the Matrigel ® layer. Matrigel ® transmigration of eosinophils induced by PAF and IL- 5 was inhibited by 1, 10 -phenanthroline, <b>batimastat,</b> 3, 4 -dichloroisocoumarin, chymostatin, and a neutralizing antibody for the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 9, indicating that serine proteinase(s) and MMP, specifically MMP- 9, were involved in the transmigration of eosinophils through Matrigel ®.

40|$|Fractalkine/CX 3 C-chemokine ligand 1 is {{expressed}} as a membrane-spanning adhesion molecule that can be cleaved from the cell surface to produce a soluble chemoattractant. Within the vasculature, fractalkine {{is known to be}} generated by endothelial cells, but to date there are no reports describing its expression by smooth muscle cells (SMC). In this study we demonstrate that IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, but not IL- 1 beta, cooperate synergistically to induce fractalkine mRNA and protein expression In cultured aortic SMC. We also report the release of functional, soluble fractalkine from the membranes of stimulated SMC. This release is inhibited by the zinc metalloproteinase inhibitor <b>batimastat,</b> resulting in the accumulation of membrane-associated fractalkine on the SMC surface. Therefore, an SMC-derived metalloproteinase activity is involved in fractalkine shedding. While soluble fractalkine present in SMC-conditioned medium is capable of inducing calcium transients in cells expressing the fractalkine receptor (CX 3 CR 1), blocking experiments using neutralizing Abs reveal that it can be inactivated without affecting the chemotactic activity of SMC-conditioned media on monocytes. However, membrane-bound fractalkine {{plays a major role in}} promoting adhesion of monocytic cells to activated SMC. This fractalkine-mediated adhesion is further enhanced in the presence of <b>batimastat,</b> indicating that shedding of fractalkine from the cell surface down-regulates the adhesive properties of SMC.

40|$|Utilizing an {{in vitro}} {{laminitis}} explant model, we have investigated how bacterial broth cultures and purified bacterial proteases activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and alter structural integrity of cultured equine lamellar hoof explants. Four Gram-positive Streptococcus spp. and three Gram-negative bacteria all induced a dose-dependent activation of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 and caused lamellar explants to separate. MMP activation was deemed {{to have occurred}} if a specific MMP inhibitor, <b>batimastat,</b> blocked MMP activity and prevented lamellar separation. Thermolysin and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB) both separated explants dose-dependently but only thermolysin was inhibitable by <b>batimastat</b> or induced MMP activation equivalent to that seen with bacterial broths. Additionally, thermolysin and broth MMP activation appeared to be cell dependent as MMP activation did not occur in isolation. These results suggest the rapid increase in streptococcal species in the caecum and colon observed in parallel with carbohydrate induced equine laminitis may directly cause laminitis via production of exotoxin(s) capable of activating resident MMPs within the lamellar structure. Once activated, these MMPs can degrade key components of the basement membrane (BM) hemidesmosome complex, ultimately separating the BM from the epidermal basal cells resulting in the characteristic laminitis histopathology of hoof lamellae. While many different causative agents have been evaluated in the past, {{the results of this}} study provide a unifying aetiological mechanism for the development of carbohydrate induced equine laminitis.

We have examined the interaction of <b>batimastat</b> (BB- 94) with a metalloproteinase [atrolysin C (Ht-d), EC 3. 4. 24. 42] active site at 2. 0 -angstroms resolution (R = 16. 8 %). The title structure exhibits an unexpected binding geometry, with the thiophene ring deeply inserted into the primary specificity site. This unprecedented binding geometry dramatizes the significance of the cavernous primary specificity site, pointing the way for the design {{of a new generation of}} potential antitumor drugs...|$|E
40|$|CD 23 (low-affinity IgE receptor, FcepsilonRII) is {{expressed}} as a Type II extracellular protein {{on a variety of}} cells such as B-cells, monocytes and macrophages and is cleaved from the cell surface to generate several distinct fragments. The expression of CD 23 on the cell surface as well as the generation of soluble fragments of CD 23 {{has been shown to be}} involved in the regulation of IgE synthesis. Here we report that the release of CD 23 from the cell surface is mediated by a metalloprotease. An assay utilizing purified CD 23 and an neo-epitope antibody specific for one of the known cleavage products is described and used to demonstrate unambiguously the cleavage of CD 23 by a distinct protease. Characterization of the mechanism of CD 23 processing shows that the protease exists as an integral membrane protein with a functional molecular mass of approx. 63 kDa as determined by gel-filtration chromatography. The CD 23 -cleaving activity found in enriched plasma membranes from RPMI 8866 cells is inhibited by the metalloprotease inhibitors 1, 10 -phenanthroline and imidazole and by the matrix metalloprotease inhibitor <b>batimastat,</b> but not by inhibitors of cysteine proteases, serine proteases or acid proteases. The same or a similar activity that cleaves CD 23 to the known 33 kDa fragment and is inhibited by <b>batimastat</b> is present in diverse cell types such as unstimulated fibroblasts and monocytic cell lines not expressing CD 23, as well as in the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line, RPMI 8866, which constitutively expresses CD 23...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we report}} evidences that Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (MTB) -induced apoptosis in macrophages {{is reduced by}} a broad-spectrum hydroxamic acid-based matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor, <b>Batimastat</b> (BB- 94). In particular, we show that BB- 94 administration to MTB-infected macrophages inhibits apoptosis and the downmodulation of membrane CD 14 expression. Moreover, the addition of broad spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor to cell culture, during MTB infection, decreases the release of soluble TNF-alpha and leads to a simultaneous increase of membrane TNF-alpha. These results show that MTB-induced apoptosis in macrophages is reduced by a MMP inhibitor and most probably is related to TNF-alpha release. This identifies BB- 94 as a simultaneous anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory molecule during MTB infection...|$|E
40|$|The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are {{a family}} of zincdependent proteinases {{involved}} in the degradation of the extracellular matrix. The MMPs have been implicated in the processes of tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis; are frequently overexpressed in malignant tumors; and {{have been associated with}} an aggressive malignant phenotype and adverse prognosis in patients with cancer. A number of MMP inhibitors are being developed for the treatment of cancer. The most extensively studied class of MMP inhibitors includes collagen peptidomimetics and nonpeptidomimetic inhibitors of the MMP active site, tetracycline derivatives, and bisphosphonates. The hydroxamate peptidomimetic inhibitor <b>batimastat</b> and its orally bioavailable analogue marimastat, which bind covalently to the zinc atom at the MMP-active site, were the first MMP inhibitors to b...|$|E
40|$|Involvement of HB-EGF and EGF receptortransactivation in TGF-β–mediated {{fibronectin}} {{expression in}} mesangial cells. BackgroundGq-coupled receptors {{are known to}} transactivate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) via the Ca 2 + and PKC pathways to phosphorylate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). MethodsWe studied the involvement of EGFR in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) –mediated fibronectin (FN) expression using glomerular mesangial cells. ResultsTGF-β up-regulated FN mRNA accumulation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, which was completely inhibited by phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase C (PC-PLC) inhibitor and PKC inhibitors (calphostin-C and staurosporin). The EGFR inhibitor AG 1478 completely abolished TGF-β–mediated FN expression. ERK inactivation by PD 98059, and p 38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 also showed significant inhibitory effects. Addition of neutralizing anti-heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) antibody, pretreatment with heparin and the metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor <b>batimastat</b> blocked FN expression. In mesangial cells stably transfected with a chimera containing HB-EGF and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) genes, ALP activity in incubation medium was rapidly increased by TGF-β (2. 1 -fold at 0. 5 min) and reached a 3. 7 -fold increase at two minutes, which was abolished by calphostin-C or <b>batimastat.</b> TGF-β phosphorylated EGFR, ERK and p 38 MAPK in a PKC- and MMP-dependent manner. Smad 2 phosphorylation by TGF-β was not affected by AG 1478, and HB-EGF did not activate Smad 2. FN mRNA stability was not affected by TGF-β. Cycloheximde did not interfere with TGF-β–mediated FN expression. ConclusionsThe present study demonstrated that HB-EGF processed and released via PC-PLC-PKC signaling is an intermediate molecule for TGF-β–mediated EGFR transactivation, and subsequent activation of ERK and p 38 MAPK is involved in FN expression via transcriptional regulation without requiring new protein synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Tissue damage {{analysis}} by traditional laboratory techniques is problematic. Proteomic analysis of exudates collected from affected tissue constitutes a powerful approach to assess tissue alterations, since biomarkers associated with pathologies {{can be identified}} in very low concentrations. In this study we proteomically explore the pathological effects induced by the venom of the viperid snake Bothrops asper in the gastrocnemius muscle of mice. Predominant proteins identified in the exudates included intracellular proteins, plasma proteins, extracellular matrix proteins and cell membrane-associated proteins. The presence of such proteins indicates cytotoxicity, plasma exudation, extracellular matrix degradation and shedding of membrane proteins. Some of these proteins may represent useful biomarkers for myonecrosis and microvascular damage. The effect of fucoidan, an inhibitor of myotoxic phospholipases A 2, and <b>batimastat,</b> an inhibitor of metalloproteinases, on the pathological effects induced by B. asper venom were also investigated. Fucoidan reduced the presence of intracellular proteins in exudates, whereas <b>batimastat</b> reduced the amount of relevant extracellular matrix proteins. The combination of these inhibitors resulted in the abrogation of the most relevant pathological effects of this venom. Thus, proteomic analysis of exudates represents a valuable approach to assess the characteristics of tissue damage in pathological models {{and the success of}} therapeutic interventions.
