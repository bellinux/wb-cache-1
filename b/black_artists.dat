5|$|By the 1960s, {{the term}} {{rhythm and blues}} had no longer been in wide use; instead, terms like soul music were used to {{describe}} popular music by <b>black</b> <b>artists.</b> In the 1980s, however, rhythm and blues came back into use, most often {{in the form of}} R, a usage that has continued to the present. Contemporary R arose when sultry funk singers like Prince became very popular, alongside dance-oriented pop stars like Michael Jackson and Madonna.|$|E
5|$|Shona {{sculpture}} in has survived {{through the ages}} and the modern style is a fusion of African folklore with European influences. World-renowned Zimbabwean sculptors include Nicholas, Nesbert and Anderson Mukomberanwa, Tapfuma Gutsa, Henry Munyaradzi and Locardia Ndandarika. Internationally, Zimbabwean sculptors have managed to influence {{a new generation of}} artists, particularly Black Americans, through lengthy apprenticeships with master sculptors in Zimbabwe. Contemporary artists like New York sculptor M. Scott Johnson and California sculptor Russel Albans have learned to fuse both African and Afro-diasporic aesthetics in a way that travels beyond the simplistic mimicry of African Art by some <b>Black</b> <b>artists</b> of past generations in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Following the World War II, {{gospel music}} moved into major auditoriums, and gospel music concerts became quite elaborate. In 1950, black gospel was {{featured}} at Carnegie Hall when Joe Bostic produced the Negro Gospel and Religious Music Festival. He repeated {{it the next}} year with an expanded list of performing artists, and in 1959 moved to Madison Square Garden. Today, black gospel and white gospel are distinct genres, with distinct audiences. In white gospel, {{there is a large}} Gospel Music Association and a Gospel Music Hall of Fame, which includes a few <b>black</b> <b>artists,</b> such as Mahalia Jackson, but which ignores most <b>black</b> <b>artists.</b> In the black community, James Cleveland established the Gospel Music Workshop of America in 1969.|$|E

25|$|Anderson {{became an}} {{important}} figure {{in the struggle for}} <b>black</b> <b>artists</b> to overcome racial prejudice in the United States during the mid-twentieth century. In 1939, the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) refused permission for Anderson to sing to an integrated audience in Constitution Hall. The incident placed Anderson into the spotlight of the international community on a level unusual for a classical musician. With the aid of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and her husband Franklin D. Roosevelt, Anderson performed a critically acclaimed open-air concert on Easter Sunday, April 9, 1939, {{on the steps of the}} Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. She sang before a crowd of more than 75,000 people and a radio audience in the millions. Anderson continued to break barriers for <b>black</b> <b>artists</b> in the United States, becoming the first black person, American or otherwise, to perform at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City on January 7, 1955. Her performance as Ulrica in Giuseppe Verdi's Un ballo in maschera at the Met was the only time she sang an opera role on stage.|$|E

25|$|In {{contemporary}} art, black {{subject matter}} {{has been used}} as raw material to portray the Black experience and aesthetics. The way Blacks' facial features were once conveyed as stereotypical in media and entertainment continues to be an influence within art. Dichotomies arise from artworks such as Open Casket by Dana Schutz based on the murder of Emmett Till to remove the painting and destroy it from the way Black pain is conveyed. Meanwhile, <b>Black</b> <b>artists</b> such as Kerry James Marshall portrays the Black body as empowerment and Black invisibility.|$|E

25|$|Gender {{and racial}} issues are {{represented}} in Dreamgirls being a black-cast musical with three female lead roles. Being set in the 1960s, the Black Power Movement was influential on the story line with <b>black</b> <b>artists</b> starting {{to succeed in the}} music industry and black music becoming accessible to all audiences, which is a representation of racial boundaries being broken down. The story is based on three women working their way up in the music industry to achieve their dreams while the most powerful people in the industry are men. In the end, the women stand up for their rights and become influential figures.|$|E
25|$|Malan {{grew up in}} {{a middle-class}} and pro-apartheid Afrikaner family in a white suburb of Johannesburg. He {{attended}} Blairgowrie Primary School in Randburg.

He attended the then Witwatersrand University for a year. To avoid conscription, which was compulsory for all white males (see End Conscription Campaign), he moved to Los Angeles in 1977 and worked as a journalist.|$|E
25|$|Davis was a {{headliner}} at The Frontier Casino in Las Vegas, but he {{was required}} (as were all black performers in the 1950s) to lodge in a rooming house {{on the west side}} of the city, instead of in the hotels as his white colleagues did. No dressing rooms were provided for black performers, and they had to wait outside by the swimming pool between acts. Davis and other <b>black</b> <b>artists</b> could entertain but could not stay at the hotels where they performed, gamble in the casinos, or dine or drink in the hotel restaurants and bars. Davis later refused to work at places which practiced racial segregation.|$|E

25|$|Gershwin's all-black opera {{was also}} unpopular with some celebrated <b>black</b> <b>artists.</b> Harry Belafonte {{declined}} to play Porgy {{in the late}} 1950s film version, so the role went to Sidney Poitier. Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My {{way of dealing with}} it was to see that it was really a piece of Americana, of American history, whether we liked it or not. Whether I sing it or not, it was still going to be there.|$|E
25|$|Blackface was an {{important}} performance tradition in the American theater for roughly 100 years beginning around 1830. It quickly became popular elsewhere, particularly so in Britain, where the tradition lasted longer than in the U.S., occurring on primetime TV, most famously in The Black and White Minstrel Show, which ended in 1978, and in Are You Being Served?s Christmas specials in 1976 and finally in 1981. In both the United States and Britain, blackface was most commonly used in the minstrel performance tradition, which it both predated and outlasted. Early white performers in blackface used burnt cork and later greasepaint or shoe polish to blacken their skin and exaggerate their lips, often wearing woolly wigs, gloves, tailcoats, or ragged clothes to complete the transformation. Later, <b>black</b> <b>artists</b> also performed in blackface.|$|E
25|$|Hughes {{stressed}} {{a racial}} consciousness and cultural nationalism devoid of self-hate. His thought united people of African descent and Africa {{across the globe}} to encourage pride in their diverse black folk culture and black aesthetic. Hughes {{was one of the}} few prominent black writers to champion racial consciousness as a source of inspiration for <b>black</b> <b>artists.</b> His African-American race consciousness and cultural nationalism would influence many foreign black writers, including Jacques Roumain, Nicolás Guillén, Léopold Sédar Senghor, and Aimé Césaire. Along with the works of Senghor, Césaire, and other French-speaking writers of Africa and of African descent from the Caribbean, such as René Maran from Martinique and Léon Damas from French Guiana in South America, the works of Hughes helped to inspire the Négritude movement in France. A radical black self-examination was emphasized in the face of European colonialism. In addition to his example in social attitudes, Hughes had an important technical influence by his emphasis on folk and jazz rhythms as the basis of his poetry of racial pride.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{has also}} been {{recognized}} for playing {{a pivotal role in}} crossing racial boundaries in the recording industry, where <b>black</b> <b>artists</b> were once considered to be substandard. In Right to Rock: The Black Rock Coalition and the Cultural Politics of Race (2004), author Maureen Mahon states: [...] "In the 1980s, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, and Prince were among the African American artists who crossed over... When <b>black</b> <b>artists</b> cross over into pop success they cease to be black in the industry sense of the word. They get promoted from racialized black music to universal pop music in an economically driven process of racial transcendence." [...] Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge (2000) documented that Jackson, along with other prominent African-American women, had achieved financial breakthroughs in mainstream popular music, receiving [...] "superstar status" [...] in the process. She, alongside her contemporaries [...] "offered viable creative, intellectual, and business paths for establishing and maintaining agency, lyrical potency, marketing and ownership." [...] Her business savvy has been compared to that of Madonna, gaining a level of autonomy which enables [...] "creative latitude and access to financial resources and mass-market distribution." [...] A model of reinvention, author Jessie Carney Smith wrote that [...] "Janet has continued to test the limits of her transformative power", receiving accolades in music, film and concert tours throughout the course of her career.|$|E

Du Bois insisted that artists recognize their moral responsibilities, writing that [...] "a black artist is first of all a black artist." [...] He was also concerned that <b>black</b> <b>artists</b> were not using their art to promote black causes, saying [...] "I do not care a damn for any art that is not used for propaganda." [...] By the end of 1926, he stopped employing The Crisis to support the arts.|$|E
