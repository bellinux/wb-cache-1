40|$|Net N-mineralization and {{nitrification}} from soil {{organic matter}} and from vegetable crop residues (leaf-blades <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> and stems <b>of</b> red cabbage) were measured at 4 temperatures during aerobic incubation in the laboratory. C-mineralization from leaf-blades <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> was monitored at 3 different temperatures. N-mineralization from {{soil organic matter}} was best described by zero order kinetics N(t) =kt whereas N- and C-mineralization from the crop residues were described by single first order kinetics. Stems of red cabbage mineralized much more slowly than leaf-blades <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower.</b> S-shaped functions were fitted {{to the relationship between}} the rate constants of both C and N-mineralization and temperature. The rate parameter kappa of the S-shaped function reflects the temperature dependence of the mineralization rate k. The parameter kappa for N-mineralization of the stem material (kappa= 5. 36) was significantly higher than for the leaf-blades (kappa= 3. 38), indicating that there is a strong interaction between temperature and resistance to degradation in the soil. N-mineralization from soil organic matter was least sensitive to temperature (kappa= 2. 63). Temperature dependence of nitrification was not significantly different from mineralization over the temperature range considered.

40|$|A {{protocol}} for cauliflower micro-propagule production {{was developed and}} optimised for both micropropagation and artificial seed production techniques using meristematic tissues from cauliflower curd. All steps in the protocol were empirically optimised including: blending, sieving, culture methods, liquid culture media composition and plant growth regulator combinations and concentrations. The cost of the micro-propagules could be reduced {{by as much as}} 50 % on the initial costings reported previously since treatments doubled the number of microshoots produced per culture unit. The research confirmed the suitability <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots to be encapsulated as artificial seeds and an effective {{protocol for}} microshoot encapsulation was designed through the optimization of 1) the production <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots suitable for encapsulation, 2) encapsulation procedures, 3) artificial seed artificial endosperm structure, 4) conversion materials. The possibility <b>of</b> culturing <b>cauliflower</b> artificial seeds in commercial substrates such as perlite, sand, vermiculite and compost was confirmed. The use of plant preservative mixture (PPM) for the control <b>of</b> contamination in <b>cauliflower</b> culture media and artificial seeds was optimised and the effect of this material on the development of plant material was assessed. It was confirmed that cauliflower artificial seed could be stored in a domestic refrigerator for up to 6 months which could have a great impact in cauliflower breeding programmes. The huge number <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots that could be produced using this protocol and the homogeneity of the culture system, provided a tool for the molecular analysis <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots (and artificial seed) abiotic stress tolerance analysis. Various treatments were conducted to improve microshoot cold tolerance and the up-regulation of the CBF/DREB 1 transcription factor including low temperature acclimation, mannitol, ABA (abscisic acid) and Mo (molybdenum). Microshoots were confirmed to acclimate successfully using low temperature. Mo was shown to improve the cold tolerance <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots and to up-regulate CBF/DREB 1 in the absence of low temperature acclimation. Acclimation did not increase the accumulation of dehydrin proteins and it is concluded that dehydrins do not {{play a significant role in}} the cold tolerance <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots. Since cauliflower breeding and seed multiplication protocols make extensive use of micropropagation, the studies reported in this research could make a significant impact by decreasing the cost of micropropagation and increasing its reliability. It also opens new perspectives for further research for cauliflower artificial seed production and the possibility of sowing these seeds directly in the field. Furthermore, this research helps to facilitate cauliflower breeding programmes by improving the understanding of abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms and the relationship between different types of abiotic stresses such as cold and drought.

The highest heavy metals concentrations in soil and plant parts (curd and leaf) were recorded from 20 Mg ha- 1 BS application. Accumulation of heavy metals in leaf was higher than in curd. The curd yield <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> significantly increased with brewery sludge application as compared to control. Heavy metals in soil were within the USEPA permissible limits. Leaf and curd in all treatments assimilated Zn and Cu below the FAO/WHO maximum permissible value. But Pb and Cd concentrations in leaf and curd exceeded the FAO/WHO maximum permissible value, except Pb concentration in curd from control and 5 Mg ha- 1 BS application. Cr concentration was below the FAO/WHO maximum permissible value in curd; whereas the concentration in leaf surpassed the maximum permissible value except in unamended soil and 5 Mg ha- 1 BS application. Thus, this study highlights the risk involved in consumption <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> receiving brewery sludge and likelihood of human exposure to heavy metals. Key word...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGlucosinolates (GLSs) are {{of great}} {{interest}} for their potential as antioxidant and anticancer agents. Our aim was to assess in vitro antioxidant activity <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> GLSs and their derivatives, {{as well as to}} evaluate their contribution to the overall antioxidant capacity <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> extracts using four different in vitro assays, 2, 20 -azino-bis-(3 -ethyl-benzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid) radical cation (ABTS-+), 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl assay (DPPH-), oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay (ORAC) and superoxide radical scavenging activity assay (SRSA). The antioxidant activities of GLSs determined using ABTS-+ and DPPH- assays were weak. In contrast, ORAC and SRSA assays showed significant antioxidant activity for GLSs. This activity was particularly important for glucobrassicin, which was the most effective GLS, and for glucoiberin and gluconapin. Mixtures of GLSs did not show either synergy or antagonism in general. Interestingly, the breakdown products, i. e. enzymatic hydrolysis-derived products (EHDP) of GLSs, were far more active than the native GLSs. The highest increases in antioxidant activity were obtained for EHDPs from progoitrin, sinigrin and glucoraphanin; progoitrin EHDP being the second most active derivative behind glucobrassicin EHDP. Antioxidant activities and GLS composition <b>of</b> different <b>cauliflower</b> by-product extracts were also determined.

40|$|An {{effective}} {{protocol for}} the mass production <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots was refined using the meristematic layer <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> curd. The meristimatic layer was excised, homogenized using a commercial blender and separated into desirable size classes and cultured in liquid culture media containing 2 mg/L kinetin, 1 mg/L IBA (indole butyric acid) and different types and concentrations of sugars. Among several concentrations of sucrose derived from sugar beet, the use of 3 % concentration {{was found to be}} the optimal. Fructose, glucose and maltose were also tested at 1. 5, 3, and 4. 5 % concentrations and compared with the use of 3 % of sucrose which was considered as a standard (control).

40|$|Molybdenum (Mo) {{was used}} to improve the cold {{tolerance}} <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots/artificial seeds. The optimal stage to introduce Mo to the micropropagation system {{was found to be}} the microshoots liquid culture stage, since its use within artificial seed capsules or conversion media had negative effects on conversion rate and viability. Mo was found to improve the cold tolerance of both acclimated and non-acclimated microshoots/artificial seeds. The capacity of Mo to up-regulate CBF/DREB 1 in cauliflower microshoots was confirmed. Moreover, this study is the first to confirm the ability of this element to upregulate CBF/DREB 1 without any low temperature treatment. Mo significantly increased the accumulation of 23 kDa polypeptide when it was used at 15 ppm concentration. However, Mo had a negative effect on the accumulation of dehydrin proteins which suggest that this group of proteins have no significant role in the cold tolerance <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots.
