50|$|A <b>bubble</b> <b>chart</b> {{is a type}} of {{chart that}} {{displays}} three dimensions of data. Each entity with its triplet (v1, v2, v3) of associated data is plotted as a disk that expresses two of the vi values through the disk's xy location and the third through its size. Bubble charts can facilitate the understanding of social, economical, medical, and other scientific relationships.|$|E

5000|$|Bubble charts can be {{considered}} a variation of the scatter plot, in which the data points are replaced with bubbles. As the documentation for Microsoft Office explains, [...] "You can use a <b>bubble</b> <b>chart</b> instead of a scatter chart if your data has three data series that each contain a set of values. The sizes of the bubbles are determined by the values in the third data series.".|$|E
50|$|The human {{visual system}} {{naturally}} experiences a disk's size {{in terms of}} its area. And the area of a disk—unlike its diameter or circumference—is not proportional to its radius, but to the square of the radius. So if one chooses to scale the disks' radii to the third data values directly, then the apparent size differences among the disks will be non-linear and misleading. To get a properly weighted scale, one must scale each disk's radius to the square root of the corresponding data value v3This scaling issue can lead to extreme misinterpretations, especially where the range of the data has a large spread. And because many people are unfamiliar with—or do not stop to consider—the issue and its impact on perception, those who are aware of it often have to hesitate in interpreting a <b>bubble</b> <b>chart</b> because they cannot assume that the scaling correction was indeed made. So it is important that bubble charts not only be scaled in this way, but also be clearly labeled to document that it is area, rather than radius or diameter, that conveys the data.|$|E
30|$|Considering {{the number}} of terms {{contained}} in each category and the great difference generated among the relevance of considered terms, the Hierarchical Edge Bundle loses its effectiveness in this case. For this reason, we bet for a different technique called <b>Bubble</b> <b>Chart.</b> In Data Visualization, a <b>Bubble</b> <b>Chart</b> represents three dimensions of the same data point: the x and y coordinates in the space {{and the size of}} the bubble. In our context, each bubble represents a term where the size is its relevance respect to the search query. At this point, nouns included in the chart are the result of the previous filtering and categorizing phases and we can consider all of them relevant for the specific application. For this reason, the size of the bubbles corresponds to the term frequency over the entire collection of tweets. Used color for the categories are the same of the previous visualization: orange for emergency, blue for evacuation, green for media, purple for hashtags, yellow for place, sky-blue for time and gray for general.|$|E

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{statistical}} and computational graphics, dynamic charts bring rich data visualization to multidimensional information and {{make it possible to}} tell a story with statistics. As statistical and computational graphics have advanced, motion charts have made it possible to display multivariate data using two-dimensional <b>bubble</b> <b>charts,</b> scatter plots, and series relationships over temporal periods. This visualization of data enriches its exploration and analysis and more effectively conveys information to users. Incorporating examples from actual business and economic data series, our paper illustrates how motion charts can tell dynamic stories with data.

30|$|Observing the <b>Bubble</b> <b>Chart</b> evolution, it is {{possible}} to note how the terms with a highest relevance are mostly contained in the specific categories of emergency, evacuation, hashtags and place. Changing the relevance measure, the most general terms disappear making the chart more readable. Moreover, the users can click on a bubble and list in a separate section the tweets with that term. In the future, we are studying the possibility to select more than one bubble and show tweets where the terms co-occur.|$|E
30|$|One of {{the aspects}} {{to take into}} account to choose a {{specific}} visualization technique is the volume of data to be presented. Depending on how many concepts have been extracted and categorized, users could find more effective a technique instead of another. Here we are going to present two different visualizations: a Hierarchical Edge Bundle and a <b>Bubble</b> <b>Chart.</b> Other types of visualizations might be required in other scenarios, but the goal of this paper is not to describe all possible visualizations but to test whether semantic mechanisms help to organize information in a meaningful way.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Few studies {{discuss the}} {{indicators}} {{used to assess}} the effect on cost containment in healthcare across hospitals in a single-payer national healthcare system with constrained medical resources. We present the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to assess how well Taiwan constrained hospital-provided medical services in such a system. Methods A custom Excel-VBA routine to record the distances of standard deviations (SD s) from the central line (the mean over the previous 12 [*]months) of a control chart was used to construct and scale annual medical expenditures sequentially from 2000 to 2009 for 421 hospitals in Taiwan to generate the ICC. The ICC was then used to evaluate Taiwan’s[*]year-based convergent power to remain unchanged in hospital-provided constrained medical services. A <b>bubble</b> <b>chart</b> of SDs for a specific month was generated to present the effects of using control charts in a national healthcare system. Results ICCs were generated for Taiwan’s[*]year-based convergent power to constrain its medical services from 2000 to 2009. All hospital groups showed a gradually well-controlled supply of services that decreased from 0. 772 to 0. 415. The <b>bubble</b> <b>chart</b> identified outlier hospitals that required investigation of possible excessive reimbursements in a specific time period. Conclusion We recommend using the ICC to annually assess a nation’s[*]year-based convergent power to constrain medical services across hospitals. Using sequential control charts to regularly monitor hospital reimbursements is required to achieve financial control in a single-payer nationwide healthcare system. </p...|$|E

30|$|Next, it was analyzed, {{how often}} one wood {{property}} {{was connected to}} a specific wood species. For this purpose, the required wood properties were assigned to every object part. The counts of one property in connection with one species were summed up and divided by the total frequency of the given species. The resulting index displays the percentage of objects showing the individual properties within each wood species and is further on referred as property index. The property index is therefore {{a measure of the}} relative importance of the wood property for a specific species and can vary between values of 0 and 1 (with 1 meaning 100  % assignments of a property for a certain species). The index is illustrated as a <b>bubble</b> <b>chart</b> where only wood species appearing more than ten times are shown.|$|E
40|$|Highly {{regulated}} {{industries such as}} pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals {{face the}} challenge of maintaining a 0 continuous stream of new products. This is difficult because of low probabilities of technical success, high development costs, uncertain market impact, a scarcity of good new product ideas, and limited human and capital resources available to develop them. The problem of evaluating and selecting which new products to develop and then of sequencing or of scheduling them is complicated further by the presence of dependencies between products both in the market place and in the development process itself. This study proposes a portfolio management approach that selects a sequence of projects, which maximizes the expected economic returns at an acceptable level of risk for a given level of resources in a new product development pipeline. A probabilistic network model of distinct activities is used to capture all the activities and resources required in the ‘‘process’ ’ of developing a new drug. A prioritization scheme suggesting sequences for developing new independent drug candidates with unlimited resources is generated with a conventional <b>bubble</b> <b>chart</b> approach. These sequences initiate a genetic algorithm (GA) -based search for the optimal sequence in the presence of product dependencies and limited resources. By statistically evaluating the sequences generated during the GA search using a discrete event simulation model, it is possible to construct an economic reward-risk frontier that illustrates the trade-offs between expected rewards and risks. The model ideally is suited to answer various ‘‘what if’ ’ questions relative to changes in the resource level on pipeline performance. The methodology is illustrated with an industrially motivated case study, involv-ing nine interdependent new product candidates targeting three diseases. The dra-matic results yield a candidate sequence with an expected return 28 percent higher than the sequence suggested by the <b>bubble</b> <b>chart</b> approach at almost the same level of risk. The synergism among the candidate dependencies, pipeline resources, and economic and technical uncertainties demonstrates the necessity of a computation-ally intensive approach if the best development strategy is to be realized...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- A {{personalized}} approach (PA) {{has been}} presented recently to prevent fraud in using credit cards. This new approach proposes to predict a user’s new transactions by his/her personalized model instead of using multiple-user approaches (MUA) {{which are based on}} transaction data of many other users. This approach has shown its potential to deal with the credit card fraud problem. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the performance of back propagation networks (BPN) on predicting credit card fraud using PA. The trained and tested data are stratified, i. e., each class has representative data. To facilitate the decision of the network architecture, Bubble charts are employed. Results from this study show that with stratified data, BPN can obtain good prediction performance. In addition, <b>Bubble</b> <b>chart</b> is a convenient tool to help decide the architecture of the network. Key-Words: credit card fraud, back propagation networks, personalized approach...|$|E
