5000|$|Shot peening is a {{solution}} process for flattening a deformed steel belt in which {{the surface of the}} belt is hammered with small spherical stainless steel or carbon steel <b>balls</b> called <b>peening</b> shot. Every single small piece of shots hitting the steel belts functions as a small <b>peening</b> <b>hammer,</b> transmitting a small indentation or dimple on the steel belt surface. In order for the indentation to be formed, the steel belt surface layer must yield in tension. The compressed grains help to recover the surface to its real surface (original surface) producing a hemisphere of cold-worked metal extremely stressed in compression. Overlapping indentation create a homogeneous layer of residual compressive stress. It is well known that cracks will not lead up nor propagate in a compressible stressed zone. Because nearly all fatigue and stress corrosion failures create at the surface of a part, compressive stresses generate by shot peening provide very important increases in life time.Note that: ...|$|R

40|$|Various {{traumatic}} {{events such as}} automobile accidents, structure fires, or terrorist attacks result in traumatic and thermal injury. Fire is a destructive force that can alter or destroy evidence, and thermal alterations have negative effects on forensic and anthropological recovery and analysis. Blunt force trauma is particularly difficult to analyze because of the multiple ways in which this trauma appears on a body and the variety of objects that can impact and fracture a bone or the variety of ways a body can impact a blunt surface. As fire is a common way to cover up a crime and blunt force trauma {{is used as a}} means to kill or injure an individual, it is necessary to understand the differences between these two types of fractures that can present together on bone. The present study was performed to determine the amount of survivability of traumatic fracture patterns in remains that have been exposed to a burning event. The sample used for this investigation was composed of twenty limbs (forty long bones) from five full-grown, domestic, female sheep (Ovis aries) obtained from a farm in Connecticut. Thirty specimens were traumatized with the head of an Estwing <b>ball</b> <b>peen</b> <b>hammer</b> and ten were left as controls. After specimens were subjected to blunt force trauma, each was radiographed using Computed Tomography. They were then placed in a small structure, 8 ' x 8 ', that was constructed to simulate the conditions of a house fire. Each post-burn bone was analyzed based on a number of characteristics. A trauma score of " 1 " no trauma, " 2 " ambiguous, and " 3 " traumatic fractures were given based on these observations. CT scans were examined after bone samples had been analyzed. Again, each specimen's CT scan was given a trauma score (" 1 " no trauma, " 2 " ambiguous, and " 3 " traumatic fractures). Results from the bone analysis on the 30 traumatized and burned specimens revealed that 15 did not have trauma, 2 were ambiguous (i. e., they may have trauma but traumatic characteristics were not distinct), and 13 presented with distinguishable traumatic injury. Comminuted was the most prominent type of fracture, and the next most common fracture was oblique. The majority of traumatic injury was found on the middle portion of the bone. CT examination showed that 12 specimens had suffered traumatic injury. The two analyses were compared and showed an agreement of 83. 3 % between the trauma scores. Results show that differentiation of traumatic and thermally induced fractures is possible using various fracture characteristics as well as taphonomic indicators to determine the sequence of events...|$|E

40|$|Highly {{stressed}} {{turbine blades}} made of Inconel 718 (DIN NiCr 19 NbMo (2. 4668); ASTM B 637; UNS N 07718) have to satisfy stringent requirements regarding durability and reliability. The impact of surface integrity on the fatigue {{strength of the}} workpiece material {{has proven to be}} of significant importance. An optimization of the surface integrity after wire EDM of Inconel 718 can be achieved using the surface finishing process machine <b>hammer</b> <b>peening.</b> Machine <b>hammer</b> <b>peening</b> is an incremental forming process which has the potential to induce residual compressive stresses and strain hardening while smoothing surface asperities. As the effect of machine <b>hammer</b> <b>peening</b> on surface integrity has not yet been completely investigated, this paper deals with its description and modeling of the unknown impact of machine <b>hammer</b> <b>peening</b> on the fatigue strength of Inconel 718. Wire EDM and machine <b>hammer</b> <b>peening</b> parameters maximizing the fatigue strength are presented. Experimental measurements are performed to quantify the surface integrity, especially surface roughness, compressive residual stresses and strain hardening, after wire EDM and subsequent machine <b>hammer</b> <b>peening.</b> The evaluation of the effect of surface integrity on the fatigue strength is carried out using a bending fatigue strength testing machine. Additionally, a finite element model is developed to analyze the surface integrity under load and to reveal the effects of difficult-to-measure properties on the fatigue strength. Based on the new knowledge gained during this work, a model to predict the fatigue strength using similitude theory is presented. Along with the previously analyzed correlations between surface integrity and fatigue strength, this allows a constructive setting of machine <b>hammer</b> <b>peening</b> parameters. Thereby, a significant new contribution to knowledge about the influence of machine <b>hammer</b> <b>peening</b> on surface integrity and fatigue strength of Inconel 718 is made. The presented approach can be easily transferred to other materials and workpiece geometries...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} <b>hammer</b> <b>peening</b> on the fatigue {{resistance}} of high strength welded steel S 690 has been investigated. Cyclic four points bending tests {{have been performed}} on butt weld samples, manually and automatically hammered. Microstructural and mechanical modifications induced by both methods and their subsequent influences on fatigue life have been studied using several characterization techniques. A comparison of residual stress measurements using X-ray diffraction shows also differences between methods. On the other hand, hardness profile of the strain hardened region is very similar for both types of samples. The ultra-fine grain microstructure of the heat-affected zone (HAZ) induced by the <b>hammer</b> <b>peening</b> process has been studied by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy and Electron Back Scattered Technique (EBSD). In fatigue as expected, <b>hammer</b> <b>peening</b> increases the fatigue strength of weld structures in good agreement with the latest proposal of the International Institute of Welding (IIW). Compressive residual stresses play a key role. Microstructure {{does not seem to}} affect fatigue strength in spite of nanostructured layer. On the contrary to what is usually admitted, the local geometry of the weld toe is deteriorated because the process induces crack-like folds.

50|$|The {{compressive}} {{residual stress}} {{in a metal}} alloy is produced by the transfer of kinetic energy (K.E.) from a moving mass (shot particle or <b>ball</b> <b>peen)</b> into {{the surface of a}} material with the capacity to plastically deform. The residual stress profile is also dependent on coverage density. The mechanics of the collisions involve properties of the shot hardness, shape, and structure; as well as the properties of the workpiece. Factors for process development and the control for K.E. transfer for shot peening are: shot velocity (wheel speed or air pressure/nozzle design), shot mass, shot chemistry, impact angle and work piece properties. Example: if you needed very high residual stresses you would likely want to use large diameter cut-wire shot, a high-intensity process, direct blast onto the workpiece, and a very hard workpiece material.|$|R
