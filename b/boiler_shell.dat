2500|$|In 1868 Bloede {{secured a}} {{position}} at Chemical Works, a small chemical company in Brooklyn, New York, along the Gowanus creek canal. There he began to study chemical manufacturing and pharmaceutical preparations. [...] In 1873 Bloede moved to Pomeroy, Ohio, the center of salt manufacturing along the Ohio River. [...] He joined the Oakes & Rathbone Company in Parkersburg, West Virginia, [...] which produced sulfuric acid for the bromine distillers in the region. The plant was located {{on the south side}} of the Little Kanawha River a tributary of the Ohio River. Oakes left the firm in 1875 and Bloede acquired his interests, the company became known as Bloede & Rathbone. [...] The product line was extended to iron sulfate, iron nitrate, tin salts, mordants and other chemicals used mainly by the textile industry. Bloede's familiarity with the textile industry led to the idea of manufacturing aniline dyes to increase profits. [...] At the time most dyes were imported from Germany. [...] There were only two companies producing dyes in the U.S. Bloede was determined to manufacture aniline by nitrating benzene to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction. One problem he faced was to purify benzene from the light tar oils, which was supplied in barrels by coal tar distilleries and gas plants. Lacking a distillation column, he used an old <b>boiler</b> <b>shell</b> connected with a condensing coil but the benzene quality was poor.|$|E
2500|$|He then {{consulted}} with a distillation expert, James A. Moffett, who was operating the Camden {{branch of the}} Standard Oil Company of Parkersburg, Moffett was convinced that dye manufacturing could be profitable and invested money in Bloede & Rathbone. [...] Dye manufacturing was organized as a separate entity named the American Aniline Works. [...] The founders of the new company had little dye making experience so they read German texts on the subject. There was no money left for new equipment, {{so they had to}} rely on scrapped equipment they obtained from the Standard Oil junk pile. [...] Instead of a heavy cast iron nitrator, an old <b>boiler</b> <b>shell</b> with a capacity of 1,000 gallons (3785 Litres) was fitted with a central shaft of horizontal wrought iron paddles. [...] The valve regulating the flow of acid into the nitrator was operated by a wire several hundred feet away. The operator would periodically run close enough to the nitrator to read the thermometer and run back to safety. [...] Cooling was accomplished by running cold spring water over the top and sides of the nitrator, keeping the reaction within a range of five degrees Fahrenheit. This procedure resulted in 7,000 to 8,000 pounds (3175 – 3628kg) of nitrobenzene per batch. In 1883 he established himself in Baltimore as a chemist and manufacturer of chemical products; and decided that there was a wide field for improvement in the methods then in use in chemical factories. Applying his skills he made tremendous advances in the chemistry business, mainly in the methods of dyeing cotton fabrics; and between 1890 and 1895 he obtained 15 or 20 patents for his chemical processes, {{one of the most important}} patents being his process for the dyeing [...] "sun-fast", unfading shades.|$|E
50|$|Various {{forms of}} Ramsbottom valve were produced. Some were {{separate}} fittings to the boiler, through separate penetrations. Others were {{contained in a}} U-shaped housing fastened to a single opening in the <b>boiler</b> <b>shell.</b> As boiler diameter increased, some forms were even set inside the <b>boiler</b> <b>shell,</b> with the springs housed in a recess inside and only the valves and balance lever protruding outside. These had obvious drawbacks for easy maintenance.|$|E
5000|$|Horizontal return tubular boiler (HRT) has a {{horizontal}} cylindrical shell, containing several horizontal flue tubes, {{with the fire}} located directly below the <b>boiler's</b> <b>shell,</b> usually within a brickwork setting ...|$|R
50|$|In use {{they were}} {{continuously}} rotated by an engine, steam being supplied through a rotating joint in the axle. They were usually spherical, sometimes cylindrical, {{and some were}} recycled from old <b>boiler</b> <b>shells.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first units had piston valves, {{the later}} ones slide valves. The riveted boiler barrel {{comprised}} two <b>boiler</b> <b>shells</b> and the smokebox was also rivetted. At {{the back of}} the boiler was the copper firebox. Two vacuum Dampfstrahlpumpen served as feed pumps.|$|R
50|$|The {{general layout}} {{is that of}} a squat {{horizontal}} cylinder. One or more large cylindrical furnaces are in {{the lower part of the}} <b>boiler</b> <b>shell.</b> Above this is a large number of small-diameter fire-tubes. Gases and smoke from the furnace pass to the back of the boiler, then return through the small tubes and up and out of the chimney. The ends of these multiple tubes are capped by a smokebox, outside the <b>boiler</b> <b>shell.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The first {{recorded}} boiler of comparable form {{was used in}} a railway locomotive, Hackworth's [...] 'Wilberforce' [...] class of 1830. This had a long cylindrical <b>boiler</b> <b>shell</b> similar to his earlier return-flued [...] 'Royal George' , but with the return flue replaced {{by a number of}} small firetubes, as had been demonstrated so effectively by Stephenson with his [...] 'Rocket' [...] a year earlier. The novel feature of an entirely internal combustion chamber was used. Unlike the later Scotch boiler though, this was self-supported by its own stays, rather than using stays through the walls of the <b>boiler</b> <b>shell.</b> This allowed the entire assembly of outer tubeplate, furnace tube, combustion chamber and firetubes to all be removed from the <b>boiler</b> <b>shell</b> as one unit, simplifying manufacture and maintenance. Although a valuable feature, this became impractical for larger diameter chambers that would require the support of the shell.|$|E
50|$|This {{design has}} also been {{suggested}} for model engineering use. In this case the belt was formed inside the <b>boiler</b> <b>shell,</b> with a tubeplate of reduced diameter set inside it.|$|E
50|$|Both K5 {{locomotives}} {{were given}} a 130-P-75 tender carrying 12,475 gal of water and 22 ST of coal. Surprisingly for such large locomotives built at such a late date, both were equipped for hand firing. Both were fitted with Worthington-pattern feedwater heaters, power reverse, unflanged main drivers, and both used nickel steel <b>boiler</b> <b>shells.</b> As built, both carried their bell on the smokebox front, hung below the headlight; this arrangement was common on other roads {{but at the time}} unique on the PRR.|$|R
5000|$|Fairbairn's five-tube boiler, {{an earlier}} centre-flued <b>boiler</b> with {{multiple}} <b>shells.</b>|$|R
50|$|Not all <b>shell</b> <b>boilers</b> raise steam; {{some are}} {{designed}} specifically for heating pressurised water.|$|R
50|$|Parallel tube boilers {{place all}} of their fire-tubes in a single {{parallel}} group, running {{from side to side}} of the <b>boiler</b> <b>shell.</b> The best known of these is the Cochran design.|$|E
50|$|A fuel {{explosion}} {{within the}} confines of the firebox may damage the pressurized boiler tubes and interior shell, potentially triggering structural failure, steam or water leakage, and/or a secondary <b>boiler</b> <b>shell</b> failure and steam explosion.|$|E
50|$|A simple flue must be long {{if it is}} {{to offer}} {{adequate}} heating area. In a short <b>boiler</b> <b>shell,</b> such as required for a steam locomotive, this may be done by using a U-shaped return flue that bends back on itself.|$|E
50|$|The first {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} the stress in cylinders {{was developed by the}} mid-19th century engineer William Fairbairn, assisted by his mathematical analyst Eaton Hodgkinson. Their first interest was in studying the design and failures of steam boilers. Fairbairn realised that the hoop stress was twice the longitudinal stress, an important factor in the assembly of <b>boiler</b> <b>shells</b> from rolled sheets joined by riveting. Later work was applied to bridge building, and the invention of the box girder. In the Chepstow Railway Bridge, the cast iron pillars are strengthened by external bands of wrought iron. The vertical, longitudinal force is a compressive force, which cast iron is well able to resist. The hoop stress is tensile and so wrought iron, a material with better tensile strength than cast iron, is added.|$|R
40|$|Finite element {{method was}} used for {{simulating}} the hydrodynamics of fire-tube boiler with the ANSYS Fluent 12. 1. 4 engineering simulation software. Hydrodynamic structure and volumetric temperature distribution were calculated. The results are presented in graphical form. Complete geometric model of the fire-tube boiler based on boiler drawings was considered. Obtained results are suitable for qualitative analysis of hydrodynamics and singularities identification in fire-tube <b>boiler</b> water <b>shell...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{cylindrical}} furnace or firebox fits entirely {{within the}} <b>boiler's</b> outer <b>shell.</b> Unlike the locomotive boiler, {{there is no}} firebox grate emerging beneath the main boiler. The boiler has similarities with both the locomotive boiler (the multiple small fire-tubes), and the Scotch marine boiler (the short cylindrical furnace). As a fire-tube boiler it has generous heating area and so is an effective steamer. Firebox construction is also simpler, thus cheaper, than for the locomotive firebox.|$|R
50|$|For efficiency, {{the boiler}} was {{commonly}} encased beneath by a brick-built chamber. Flue gases were routed through this, outside the iron <b>boiler</b> <b>shell,</b> after {{passing through the}} fire-tube and so to a chimney that was now placed at the front face of the boiler.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Derelict boiler at Clearwell Caves.Note the {{bolted joint}} {{to allow the}} <b>boiler</b> <b>shell</b> to be {{dismantled}} for cleaning. The green box encloses the electric fan for an oil spray burner. The two vertical cylinders are Mobrey automatic water-level valves controlling the feedwater level.|$|E
50|$|The Stanley boiler is {{constructed}} of a seamless copper tube shell, 13+1/2 in {{in diameter and}} 1/16 in thick. The numerous 1/2 in tubes are densely packed, leaving a very small water volume between them and a high ratio of heating surface to volume, for rapid steam raising. Construction of the boiler is unusual, as the steel tube plates are merely {{held in place by}} friction and the tubes are only lightly expanded into them with a tapered drift. Around the outside of the <b>boiler</b> <b>shell</b> are three heat-shrunk steel rings, the compressive stress of which retains the tubeplate. For additional strength, the <b>boiler</b> <b>shell</b> is further wrapped in a helical layer of piano wire. As the boiler is fired by a flat liquid-fuel burner, no enclosed firebox is required.|$|E
5000|$|The {{locomotives}} had {{an inside}} frame and the <b>boiler</b> had three <b>shells,</b> the rear one being crowned by the steam dome. The outer firebox had a Belpaire cover, a deep firebox that extended below the axles {{and a large}} smokebox.|$|R
50|$|Fairbairn's {{work had}} shown the {{benefits}} of reducing the diameter of a <b>boiler's</b> external <b>shell</b> {{as a means of}} reducing the forces upon it. The overall vertical height of the boiler could not be reduced, as this represented the clear steam space above the water level which is important to avoid the risk of priming. Oval boilers had already been tried to achieve this vertical extension, but pressure within them tended to force them into a more cylindrical shape; repeated cycling like this led to increased corrosion along the riveted joints and fatigue failures.|$|R
5000|$|These were not, however, return-flue boilers in {{the sense}} used here, but rather return-tube boilers. They had a single large {{cylindrical}} furnace tube, a combustion chamber external to the <b>boiler's</b> pressure <b>shell,</b> then multiple, narrow fire-tubes returning to a horseshoe-shaped smokebox above and around the firedoor. The proximity of this smokebox to the fireman led to their nickname of [...] "belly burners". Their design thus has {{more in common with}} the horizontal launch-type boilers (as used by Sir Arthur Heywood) or the Scotch marine boiler than they do with the simple single-flue boiler.|$|R
50|$|The boiler {{consists}} of a cylindrical vertical external shell, with a large firebox inside this, filling perhaps half of the total height. A single large vertical flue or uptake leads to an external chimney. Some boilers use vertical rod stays between the firebox crown and top of the <b>boiler</b> <b>shell.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{drawback}} of {{the boiler}} was the large {{diameter of the}} furnace relative to the <b>boiler</b> <b>shell,</b> and thus the small steam space above the crown of the furnace. This made the boilers prone to priming, particularly on a rough sea, where water could be carried over into the steam pipe.|$|E
50|$|In {{many ways}} the boiler was similar to, and a {{precursor}} of, the Sentinel of 1905. It did however require more labour to manufacture four shells rather than two, with considerably more tubes. The work of removing the <b>boiler</b> <b>shell</b> was also greater for the Straker, as it required the pipework and external fittings to first be removed.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had {{an inside}} frame {{which was built}} as a water tank. The <b>boiler</b> comprised two <b>shell</b> rings. The steam dome with its safety valve sat on the forward shell ring. The smokebox was very short. The smokestack has a Kobel spark arrestor. Later a Prüsmann chimney was used.|$|R
50|$|In {{homage to}} the Lancashire design, modern <b>shell</b> <b>boilers</b> can come with a twin furnace design. A more recent {{development}} has been the reverse flame design where the burner fires into a blind furnace and the combustion gasses double back on themselves. This results in a more compact design and less pipework.|$|R
500|$|The forward conning tower had {{a forward}} face of [...] that thinned down to 225mm on the aft section with a [...] roof. Its {{controls}} and cable runs were {{protected by a}} 100mm tube and {{the lower part of}} the conning tower's supporting structure was protected with 20mm plates. Aft there was a lightly protected auxiliary control station with 50mm sides. Between the middle and lower decks the funnel uptakes were protected by 100mm of armor and [...] between the upper and middle decks. A 125mm upper and [...] lower grating protected the <b>boilers</b> from <b>shells</b> and fragments entering through the uptake openings.|$|R
50|$|To {{avoid the}} problem of exposed fire-tubes above the water level, the {{submerged}} multi-tube boiler may be used. The upper <b>boiler</b> <b>shell</b> is extended upwards in an annular ring, so as to always maintain the whole length of the tubes submerged. Used in steam wagons and similar, where the water-level may be disturbed as the vehicle climbs a hill.|$|E
50|$|The Clarke Chapman boiler {{is similar}} to the Cochran type, with the {{difference}} that the top of the <b>boiler</b> <b>shell</b> is a shallow dome rather than a hemisphere. This dome shape is still sufficiently strong to withstand the pressure, but there is now a sharp corner between the shell and the top plate. This corner requires the support of gusset stays.|$|E
50|$|The {{double-ended}} design places two boilers back-to-back, {{removing the}} rear {{wall of the}} <b>boiler</b> <b>shell.</b> The combustion chambers and firetubes remain separate. This design saves some structural weight, but it also makes the boiler longer {{and more difficult to}} install into a ship. For this reason they were not commonly used, although back-to-back arrangements of multiple single-ended boilers were common.|$|E
5000|$|The Sentinel boiler was {{designed}} to cope with these problems, and to permit easy cleaning of the waterspace. As well as the usual blow-down cock for daily use, the entire boiler could be dismantled easily. The outer shell was in two sections, inner and outer drum, and were joined by a bolted ring joint at top and bottom. Regular servicing (depending on water conditions) was to separate the water-tubes in their drum from the <b>boiler</b> outer <b>shell,</b> {{so that they could}} be cleaned. Sludge dropped free on opening the shell and the short, straight tubes could easily be cleaned with brush or scraper.|$|R
5000|$|The inner {{frame of}} the {{locomotive}} was also used as a water tank. She {{was designed as a}} wet steam locomotive. The <b>boiler</b> had two <b>shell</b> rings and 90 heating tubes. The drive was achieved via a Walschaerts valve gear driving the third axle. The wheels on the centre axle were made without flanges to improve curve running.|$|R
40|$|Fire tube boiler is a {{one type}} of boiler. It is {{developed}} as {{the second of the}} three major historical types of boilers which are low-pressure tank, fire tube boiler and high-pressure water tube boiler. Sometimes fired tube boiler is called as a smoke tube <b>boiler</b> or <b>shell</b> <b>boiler.</b> A fired tube boiler is use for production of steam. The efficiency of steam production {{is directly related to the}} temperature, residence time of water flow and the water turbulence inside the fire tube boiler. With the aid of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), this study presents the effort performed in modelling work on the water turbulence using design of fire tube boiler without baffles and fire tube boiler with baffles. The prediction of water flow inside the boiler based on k-s turbulence model is used since it is widely applied in industries and education sectors. Anyway, the purpose of this study is to investigate the water flow and the thermal characteristics in a fire tube boiler by using FLUENT. FLUENT is the software that used as a solver and post-processing in CFD. The comparison of the water flow and the thermal characteristics between fire tube boiler without baffles and fire tube boiler will also be discussed...|$|R
