However, since the global {{downturn}} by 2010 the press corps in Brussels shrunk by a third. There is one journalist covering EU news for Latvia and none for Lithuania. Although {{there has been a}} worldwide cut in journalists, the considerable press releases and operations such as Europe by Satellite and EuroparlTV leads many news organisations to <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> cover the EU from these source and news agencies. In the face of high-level criticism, the Commission is also due to shut down Presseurop on 20 December 2013.|$|E

Leslie warns her co-workers the Venezuelan government officials will likely be poor, simple people. Later, the Venezuelan delegation arrives, headed by their parks department vice director Raul Alejandro Bastilla Pedro de Veloso de Morana, the Vice-director Ejecutivo del Diputado del Departmento de Parques, L.G.V. (Fred Armisen), Antonio, Jhonny and Elvis. There are cultural clashes right away, like when they mistake Tom (Aziz Ansari) for a servant and order him to get their bags. They also mistakenly <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> choose any woman to have sex with; they all favor Donna (Retta). Raul and Leslie exchange gifts during a meet-and-greet party, where Raul and the Venezuelans act condescending toward the Pawnee residents, making offensive remarks about the town and mocking the gifts Leslie gives them. They continue to give orders to Tom, who follows along because they give him large cash tips.|$|E

25|$|Each team plays {{each other}} team twice, once {{at home and}} once away making a total of 26 matches. Games start out as 50 over matches but if rain affects play they {{can be reduced to}} a minimum of 20 overs. The method for working out reduced targets is to take 3/4 of the first innings run rate off the first innings score for every over that is lost in the second innings. One over is lost for every 7 minutes in the first innings and every 3½ minutes in the second innings. The second innings can be less than 20 overs as long as there were more than 20 overs bowled in the first innings and the team batting second <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> chase the full total posted in the first innings or the team bowling second <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> bowl their opponents out in the {{allocated}} overs. If the team batting second get the full total then they win. If the team bowling second bowl out the team batting second then they win. If neither team does this then it is a No Result. For example, Lowerhouse scored 124–7 off their allocated 31 overs. Nelson opted to chase 125 for victory off 12 overs. They ended up on 82–7 so neither team won and it was a no result. 10 points are awarded for a win, 7 points for a tie, 3 points for a no result and 2 points for bowling the opposition out. Up to 5 bonus points are then awarded to the team who lost. If the team that lost bowled second they get 1-point for 5 wickets, 2 for 6 wickets, 3 for 7 wickets, 4 for 8 wickets and 5 for 9 wickets. If they batted second they get 1-point for being within 50 runs, 2 points for being within 40 runs, 3 points for being within 30 runs, 4 points for being within 20 runs and 5 points for being within 10 runs. 1 point is deducted for slow over rate in an innings of more than 40 overs. One over is expected to be bowled in 3¾ minutes. One bowler may bowl up to 17 overs while no other bowlers may bowl more than 14 overs.|$|E

500|$|Although physical, {{psychological}} and emotional factors militate {{to reduce the}} frequency of sex after injury, it increases after time. As years go by, the odds that a person will become involved in a sexual relationship increase. Difficulties adjusting to a changed appearance and physical limitations contribute to reduced frequency of sexual acts, and improved body image is associated with an increase. Like frequency, sexual desire and sexual satisfaction often decrease after SCI. The reduction in women's sexual desire and frequency may be {{in part because they}} <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> no longer enjoy sex, or because their independence or social opportunities are reduced.

Thus, they commit suicide {{in order to be}} resurrected as the Four Horsemen. Donaldson argues that Johnson and the Millennium Group have taken Jesus' promise of eternal life and resurrection too literally, resulting in [...] "a recreated cycle in this life rather than escape into the next". This is further proved when the four Millennium Group members return as zombies; they have achieved life after death, but only physically—not spiritually—by [...] "abusing Jesus's words to take their fate into their own hands".|$|E
500|$|Hayward {{categorized}} {{the writing}} team involved in Todd's redemption as [...] "an usually {{high number of}} male writers", and as an unusual situation because, historically, most soap opera writers have been women. In a June 1994 interview with TV Guide, in {{an article about the}} trend during the early 1990s of redeemed rapists on soap operas, head writer Malone commented that [...] "he bond between the woman and the violator is a great historical tradition in fiction and films," [...] and said that Rudolph Valentino, Humphrey Bogart, Kirk Douglas, and Clark Gable [...] "all began as totally irredeemable villains." [...] Although he did not think that most women want to be raped or are drawn to violence, he said that viewers [...] "are responding to the intensity of passion and an actor who lets you inside the torment. Some [...] <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be swept up in that passion and still turn it good. They think, 'With me, he'd be different. [...] The author of the article, Michael Logan, supported Malone's statements, and commented, [...] "Let's call a spade a spade. There is a large contingent of American female soap viewers who find something very attractive about rapists". [...] Hayward reported that many female viewers were furious that Logan had described them this way, and stated that their attraction to Todd was due to the skill of the actor portraying him.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} track, [...] "Enjoy", a song {{concerning the}} links between sex and fear, has been considered as [...] "decidedly trippy", and [...] "Posts most abrasive track". NME described it in its 1995 review as, [...] "a dark and deranged techno thing". Over military drums and [...] "squalls of noise", Björk sings about [...] "her hedonistic tendencies". The orchestral interlude [...] "You've Been Flirting Again", like the previous track [...] "Enjoy", features [...] "mysterious or open-ended lyrics". They are an attempt to describe the nature of flirting, which is [...] "ambiguous and slippery"; the playfulness of the song's title contrasting with the [...] "weightiness" [...] of its words. [...] "Isobel" [...] is a string-laden, orchestral trip hop song, with a [...] "visually rich narrative". Craig McLean of The Face called the track [...] "Broadway on breakbeats". Various critics have discussed the song's distinctive tempo, with Pulse!s Tom Lanham comparing it to [...] "a camel making {{its way across the}} desert", and Rolling Stones Lorraine Ali writing that the song [...] "snakes along like a patient desert caravan". Conceived by Björk as [...] "part autobiography part storytelling", its lyrics concern Isobel, a woman magically born in a forest who finds people in the city [...] "a bit too clever for her", eventually retreating back to nature and sending them a message of instinct through trained moths. Inspired by South American literature—particularly Gabriel García Márquez—the track's lyrics discuss [...] "the duality between reason and emotions, between intuition and intellect"; in the singer's own words, [...] "asking how 20th century civilisation clashes with nature and, in places like Iceland and Thailand, people really <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> have a TV remote control {{in one hand and a}} ghost sitting beside them".|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Gosling co-starred in the {{psychological}} thriller Murder by Numbers with Sandra Bullock and Michael Pitt, where Gosling and Pitt portrayed {{a pair of}} high school seniors who <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> commit the perfect murder. Bullock played the detective tasked with investigating the crime. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly described him as [...] "a phenomenal talent even in junk like this" [...] while Todd McCarthy of Variety felt that the [...] "strong and [...] "charismatic" [...] young actors were [...] "let down by the screenplay". The film was a minor commercial success, grossing $56 million worldwide from a production budget of $50 million. His second screen appearance of 2002 was in The Slaughter Rule with David Morse which explores the relationship between a high school football player and his troubled coach in rural Montana. Gosling has said that the opportunity to work with Morse made him [...] "a better actor". Stephen Holden of The New York Times described Gosling as [...] "major star material" [...] with a [...] "rawness and an intensity that recall the young Matt Dillon" [...] while Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times was won over by his [...] "raw talent". The film was released in just three US theatres and grossed $13,411. In 2003, Gosling starred in The United States of Leland as a teenager imprisoned for the murder of a disabled boy. He was drawn to the role because it was unusual to find a character that was [...] "emotionally disconnected for the whole film." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt that the [...] "gifted actor does everything that can be done with Leland, but the character comes from a writer's conceits, not from life." [...] A.O. Scott of The New York Times noted that he [...] "struggles to rescue Leland from the clutches of cliché" [...] while David Rooney of Variety felt that his [...] "one-note, blankly disturbed act has none of the magnetic edge of his breakthrough work in The Believer".
