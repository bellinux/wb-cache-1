50|$|The joint basing program {{represents}} Department of Defense (DoD) {{efforts to}} optimize the delivery of <b>installation</b> <b>support</b> across the services. The DoD developed joint base common output level standards (JB-COLS) to provide common output or performance level standards for <b>installation</b> <b>support.</b> The framework of JB-COLS provides a common language {{to serve as a}} basis for (1) developing common output levels for each function of <b>installation</b> <b>support</b> at joint bases and (2) developing service-wide capability-based planning models for all <b>installation</b> <b>support</b> functions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the issue of {{airborne}} sound insulation of partition wall in wooden house. Wood and wood-based constructions are very specific in terms of acoustic due to the low surface density of their elements. <b>Built-in</b> <b>installations</b> and side-ways of spread of noise negatively affect damping properties of the wall. This article contains also a proposal of structural measures to ensure better acoustic resistance of the separating elements...|$|R

30|$|Point-to-Multipoint (PtMP) {{refers to}} a one-to-many {{communication}} between the PoP and multiple small cell BSs. PtMP communications are very much related to NLOS conditions and low-frequency bands (e.g., sub- 6 GHz) {{and are able to}} overcome signal obstructions. In this case, the PoP acts as a unique data sink and can be equipped with either an omnidirectional antenna or a number of directional antennas pointing in different directions, e.g., antenna arrays with static beams, large scale antenna systems (LSAS) [7]. The latter solution with directional antennas enables the use of higher frequency bands and thus larger bandwidths due to the higher antenna gains, provided that LOS exists. However, the use of an omnidirectional antenna at the PoP eases the <b>built-in</b> <b>installation</b> and coordination requirements imposed due to beamforming.|$|R
