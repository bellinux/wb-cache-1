25|$|Reports of the quake's {{intensity}} in Christchurch generally ranged from IV to VIII (moderate to severe) on the modified Mercalli scale. A strong smell of sulphur was widely reported in Christchurch following the earthquake. Sewers were damaged, and water lines were broken. The water supply at Rolleston, located {{to the southwest}} of Christchurch, was contaminated. Power to up to 75 {{percent of the city}} was disrupted. Christchurch Hospital was forced to use emergency generators {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the quake. About 90% of the electricity in Christchurch had been restored by 6:00pm the day of the earthquake. The repair of electricity was estimated to be more difficult in the rural areas. One building caught fire after its electricity was turned back on, igniting leaking LPG in the building. The fire was quickly extinguished by the Fire Service before it could spread. Damage to <b>buried</b> <b>pipes</b> may have allowed sewage to contaminate the residential water supply. Residents were warned to boil tap water before using it for brushing teeth, drinking, and washing or cooking food. Several cases of gastroenteritis were reported. By 7 September 28 cases had been observed at the city's welfare centres. The boil water notice for Christchurch and Banks Peninsula was lifted late on 8 September 2010, after more than 500 tests conducted over three days found no contamination.|$|E

According to Ron Keating, Mayor of Waimakariri District, the town [...] "will never be the same again". As noted above, damage to <b>buried</b> <b>pipes</b> may have allowed sewage to contaminate the residential water supply, and residents were warned to boil tap water before using it for brushing teeth, drinking, and washing or cooking food. A boil water notice for most of Selwyn District was lifted on 9 September.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of using warm humid air for irrigation and drinking water production, by flowing air over the water surface in a solar still with saline or polluted water. Vapor will be saturated during mixing with the warm air in <b>buried</b> <b>pipe.</b> Finite difference method is employed to simulate the flow of the air long the pipe. The amount of water produced and <b>buried</b> <b>pipe</b> length depends upon the flow velocity, humid air properties and <b>buried</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter. The amount of water produced is 0. 02525 kg/s (0. 0909 m 3 /h).

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{composition}} and thermal property of soil are discussed. The main factors that impact the soil thermal conductivity and several commonly-used pipe materials are studied. A model of heat exchanger with horizontal pipes of ground-source heat pump is developed. The impact of soil thermal conductivity and pipe thermal conductivity on the soil temperature field around the <b>buried</b> <b>pipe,</b> and the thermal performance of the heat exchanger are simulated. The simulation results show that {{with the increase of}} soil thermal conductivity, heat transfer quantity obviously increases, and the temperature of soil around pipe decrease under winter conditions.

40|$|An {{appropriate}} {{estimation of}} <b>buried</b> <b>pipe</b> deformation {{is a major}} concern to designers in geotechnical, construction and civil engineering and traditional methods are unable to estimate this phenomenon accurately. Numerical methods may be powerful tools to cope with the complexity of this fact. This paper develops a fuzzy set based method for the analysis of <b>Buried</b> <b>Pipe's</b> deflection based on laboratory tests of small diameter <b>pipes</b> <b>buried</b> in sand which were subjected to repeated loading to simulate the vehicle loads. The experimental data from tests show that the vertical diametrical strain (VDS) (defined as the reduction in vertical diameter divided by original vertical diameter) and settlement of soil surface (SSS) significantly are depended on relative density of the soil, height of embedment depth of pipe and amplitude of applied stress, therefore the system is obtained to consider the above parameters. The outputs involve vertical diametrical strain and soil surface settlement. The results indicate that, this system provides deep knowledge of <b>buried</b> <b>pipe</b> analysis and also provide new insight in to the significance of som...|$|R
50|$|Pipeline {{developers}} do {{not always}} prioritize effective surveillance against leaks. <b>Buried</b> <b>pipes</b> draw fewer complaints. They are insulated from extremes in ambient temperature, they are shielded from ultraviolet rays, and they are less exposed to photodegradation. <b>Buried</b> <b>pipes</b> are isolated from airborne debris, electrical storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, hail, and acid rain. They are protected from nesting birds, rutting mammals, and wayward buckshot. Buried pipe is less vulnerable to accident damage (e.g. automobile collisions) and less accessible to vandals, saboteurs, and terrorists.|$|E

40|$|Abstract On {{basis of}} {{stochastic}} analysis method and finite element numerical theory, the paper which considered {{the conditions of}} random heat source did research into the temperature field of underground heat transfer.

The numerical simulation of given model has been realized with computer utilized. The research shows that the effect which ground source heat pump random heat source has on the temperature field of ground source heat pump is random obviously, which gives an important theoretical method to the analysis of mean value about the temperature field of heat transfer, the discrete analysis, as well as the design of ground source heat pump <b>buried</b> <b>pipe.</b> The engineering case shows that random effect of <b>buried</b> <b>pipe</b> heat transfer about ground source heat pump cannot be neglected...|$|R
