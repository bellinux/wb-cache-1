5|$|As {{the team}} {{changed its name}} from the Winia to the Halla the uniforms had minor changes made to them. The logo changed names and the uniforms had colored {{shoulders}} removed from them.

5|$|The United Kingdom and her Allies {{had been}} at war against Napoleon's French Empire since 1803, but by early 1814 Wellington's army had fought {{its way through the}} Peninsula to France, and the eastern Allies were {{threatening}} France's eastern <b>borders.</b> <b>On</b> 31 March 1814, allied armies entered Paris, and Napoleon abdicated on 6 April. Within a month of Napoleon's abdication, he had been exiled to Elba. It appeared that the war was over, and arrangements for the peace were discussed at the Congress of Vienna. But on 26 February 1815, Napoleon escaped from Elba and returned to France, where he raised an army.|$|E
5|$|The {{rest of the}} Snake River {{watershed}} <b>borders</b> <b>on</b> {{several other}} major Columbia River tributaries - mostly the Spokane River to the north, but also Clark Fork in Montana to the northeast and the John Day River to the west. Of these, the Clark Fork (via the Pend Oreille River) and the Spokane join the Columbia above the Snake, while the John Day joins downstream of the Snake, in the Columbia River Gorge. It is of note that the northeastern divide of the Snake River watershed forms the Idaho-Montana boundary, so the Snake River watershed does not extend into Montana.|$|E

5|$|For its fiftieth anniversary, Fantasia {{returned}} to 550 theaters nationwide on October 5, 1990, in its traditional 1946 version including the live action scenes with Taylor {{and the original}} Stokowski score. The film underwent a two-year restoration process which began after a six-month search {{to piece together the}} original negatives that had been in storage since 1946. This marked the first time since then that a release of the film had been processed from the original and not from a copy. Each of its 535,680 frames were restored at YCM Laboratories, and an untouched print from 1951 was used for guidance on color and tone. Theaters were required to have specific stereo equipment installed, and to present the film in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio with black <b>borders</b> <b>on</b> the side of their screens. The Stokowski soundtrack was digitally remastered using the 1955 magnetic soundtrack, with an estimated three thousand pops and hisses being removed in the process. The 1990 reissue of Fantasia went on to gross $25 million domestically.|$|E
5|$|On July15, 1940, Ponezhukaysky District {{was renamed}} Teuchezhsky after Adyghe poet Tsuga Teuchezh. On December7, 1956, {{the districts of}} the {{autonomous}} oblast were enlarged: the territory of Shovgenovsky District was divided among Giaginsky, Koshekhablsky, and Krasnogvardeysky Districts, while Techezhsky District was merged into Takhtamukaysky District. This enlargement, however, did not prove successful, so on August5, 1957 Takhtamukaysky District was split back into Takhtamukaysky and Teuchezhsky Districts within their old borders. At the same time, Takhtamukaysky District was renamed Oktyabrsky. Shovgenovsky District was restored in its old <b>borders</b> <b>on</b> March21, 1958. On February1, 1963, changes in administrative and territorial structure of the autonomous oblast led to the abolition of Koshekhablsky, Maykopsky, and Oktyabrsky Districts: Koshekhablsky District was merged into Shovgenovsky, Maykopsky District into Giaginsky, and Oktyabrsky District into Teuchezhsky. This change, however, was reverted in 1965, when, after several changes, the autonomous oblast became divided into six districts (Giaginsky, Koshekhablsky, Krasnogvardeysky, Maykopsky, Shovgenovsky, and Teuchezhsky). On April25, 1983, a new Oktyabrsky District was formed from {{the western part of}} the territory of Teuchezhsky District; its old name of Takhtamukaysky District was restored in 1990.|$|E

5|$|The Kennel Club {{formed in}} 1873 and, at the Fleece Hotel at Selkirk, Scottish <b>Borders</b> <b>on</b> November 17, 1875, the Dandie Dinmont Terrier Club (DDTC) was formed, {{becoming}} the third oldest breed club for {{dogs in the}} world.

The breed standard was created by William Wardlaw Reid, another founding member of the club, with it was agreed to a year later at another meeting of the club. A club show was held for the first time in Carlisle in 1877. Shows after this were held in conjunction with other clubs on a yearly basis until 1928 when it moved to the Market Hall in Carlisle, where with the exception of during the Second World War, the shows continued to be held until 1982. Shows continued to be held in the general area until 2001 when they moved south to Cheshire and Lancashire.|$|E
5|$|Fighting in Eastern Europe {{began with}} the first Austro-Hungarian {{invasion}} of Serbia in early August 1914. The number of Austro-Hungarian troops was far smaller than the 308,000-strong force intended when war was declared. This was because {{a large portion of}} the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army had moved to the Russian Front, reducing the number of troops involved in the initial stages of the invasion to approximately 200,000. Forty percent of this force was composed of South Slavs living within Austro-Hungarian <b>borders.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, the Serbs could muster some 450,000 men to oppose the Austro-Hungarians upon full mobilization. The main elements to face the Austro-Hungarians were the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and Užice Armies, with a combined strength of approximately 180,000 men. The Balkan Wars had only just concluded and Serbia was still recovering. Over 36,000 Serbian soldiers had been killed and 55,000 seriously wounded. Few recruits had been gained from the newly acquired territories, and the Serbian army had been stretched by the need to garrison them against Albanian insurgents and the threat of Bulgarian attack. To compound matters, the Serbian army was dangerously short of artillery, and had only just begun to replenish its ammunition stocks. Its supply problems also extended to more basic items. Many Serbian recruits reported for duty barefoot, and many units lacked any uniform other than a standard issue greatcoat and a traditional Serbian cap known as a šajkača. Rifles were also in critically short supply. It was estimated that full mobilization would see some 50,000 Serbian soldiers with no equipment at all. The Austro-Hungarians, on the other hand, possessed an abundance of modern rifles and had twice as many machine guns and field guns as the Serbs. They also had better stocks of munitions, as well as much better transport and industrial infrastructure behind them. The Serbs had a slight advantage over the Austro-Hungarians: many of their soldiers were experienced veterans of the Balkan Wars and better trained than their Austro-Hungarian counterparts. Serb soldiers were also highly motivated, which compensated in part for their lack of weaponry.|$|E
