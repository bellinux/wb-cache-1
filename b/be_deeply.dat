5|$|If {{the temple}} is small it {{will consist of}} only a closed mantapa (enclosed with walls {{extending}} {{all the way to}} the ceiling) and the shrine. The closed mantapa, well decorated inside and out, is larger than the vestibule connecting the shrine and the mantapa and has four lathe-turned pillars to support the ceiling, which may <b>be</b> <b>deeply</b> domed. The four pillars divide the hall into nine bays. The nine bays result in nine decorated ceilings. Pierced stone screens (Jali or Latticework) that serve as windows in the navaranga (hall) and Sabhamantapa (congregation hall) is a characteristic Hoysala stylistic element.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that the atrocities that Las Casas described were exaggerated or even invented, {{but this is not}} generally considered likely as Las Casas was far from the only person to <b>be</b> <b>deeply</b> worried about abuse and mistreatment of the Indians. The Dominican friars Antonio de Montesinos and Pedro de Córdoba had reported extensive violence already {{in the first decade of}} the conquest of the Indies, and throughout the conquest of the Americas there were reports of abuse of the natives by friars and priests and ordinary citizens, and many massacres of indigenous people were reported in full by those who perpetrated them. Even some of Las Casas's enemies, such as Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, reported many gruesome atrocities committed against the Indians by the colonizers. All in all, modern historians tend to disregard the numerical figures given by Las Casas, but maintain that the general picture he presented of an intensely violent and abusive conquest did represent reality.|$|E
5|$|This book {{returns to}} Daniel Waterhouse, who in 1685, {{has become a}} courtier to CharlesII because of his role as Secretary of the Royal Society. He warns JamesII, still Duke of York, of his brother Charles' {{impending}} death, following which, Daniel quickly becomes an advisor to JamesII. He continues to <b>be</b> <b>deeply</b> involved with the English court, ensuring the passage of several bills which reduce restrictions on non-conformists despite his detraction from the Francophile court. Meanwhile, Eliza becomes the governess of a widowers' two children in Versailles. She catches {{the eye of the}} king and becomes the broker of the French nobility. With her help, the French court, supported by King Louis, creates several market trends from which they profit extensively. Her active involvement in the French court gains her a title of nobility: Countess of Zeur.|$|E

5|$|Originally Mary {{believed}} that many nobles supported her marriage, but things soon turned sour between the newly elevated Bothwell (created Duke of Orkney) {{and his former}} peers, and the marriage proved to <b>be</b> <b>deeply</b> unpopular. Catholics considered the marriage unlawful, since they did not recognise Bothwell's divorce or {{the validity of the}} Protestant service. Both Protestants and Catholics were shocked that Mary should marry the man accused of murdering her husband. The marriage was tempestuous, and Mary became despondent. Twenty-six Scottish peers, known as the confederate lords, turned against Mary and Bothwell, raising an army against them. Mary and Bothwell confronted the lords at Carberry Hill on 15 June, but there was no battle as Mary's forces dwindled away through desertion during negotiations. Bothwell was given safe passage from the field, and the lords took Mary to Edinburgh, where crowds of spectators denounced her as an adulteress and murderer. The following night, she was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle, on an island in the middle of Loch Leven. Between 20 and 23 July, Mary miscarried twins. On 24 July, she was forced to abdicate in favour of her one-year-old son James. Moray was made regent, while Bothwell was driven into exile. He was imprisoned in Denmark, became insane and died in 1578.|$|E

25|$|In Algarve itself, Kaunians seem, already {{for several}} generations, to <b>be</b> <b>deeply</b> assimilated in the {{surrounding}} society. They speak Algarvian, wear kilts, call themselves by Algarvian names, and their males have Algarvian-style moustaches and behave in the blatant macho way encouraged by Algarvian culture. Until their persecutions started, there were prominent Kaunian scholars at the University of Trapani.|$|E

25|$|During this period, P-Orridge befriended an English {{musician}} named David Bunting; P-Orridge {{already knew}} another man named David, so coined the moniker David Tibet, which Bunting adopted {{as a stage}} name. Through an introduction provided by Burroughs, P-Orridge met Brion Gysin in Paris, probably in 1980, coming to <b>be</b> <b>deeply</b> influenced by Gysin's cut-up method; P-Orridge understood {{this to be a}} revolutionary method of escaping current patterns of thought and developing something new.|$|E
25|$|Stone {{buildings}} are often ornamented with projecting courses {{which may be}} flat fillets or rounded mouldings. These are sometimes carved with patterns, particularly chevrons. An arched doorway that is set into a thick wall may <b>be</b> <b>deeply</b> recessed, and have three or more bands of moulding around it. Doorways sometimes have colonnettes with small capitals, as are also found on the transoms that divide paired windows. Sometimes capitals and corbels are carved with floral motifs or figures.|$|E
25|$|The Vatican had {{two major}} goals at this point: {{to stem the}} rise of Socialism and to monitor the {{grassroots}} Catholic organizations (co-ops, peasant leagues, credit unions, etc.). Since the masses tended to <b>be</b> <b>deeply</b> religious but rather uneducated, the Church felt they were in need of conveyance so {{that they did not}} support improper ideals like Socialism or Anarchism. Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Giolitti understood that the time was ripe for cooperation between Catholics and the liberal system of government.|$|E

25|$|Coleridge at {{this time}} envisioned the {{community}} including “twelve men with their families,” among whom the costs would be split, with the wealthier {{members of the community}} making up for the shortcomings of the poorer members. Besides money, other practical issues arose. Having little ability in farming or carpentry, the young men planned to acquire these skills over the winter in time for a March departure. Among the families who were planning to make the voyage were children, and Coleridge worried that they might already <b>be</b> <b>deeply</b> prejudiced by society, which could subvert and corrupt the Pantisocracy.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} {{peacekeeping}} seems to <b>be</b> <b>deeply</b> embedded in Canadian culture and a distinguishing feature that Canadians feel sets their foreign policy {{apart from the}} likes of the United States. The Somalia commission wrote in 1997 that “Canada’s foreign policy with respect to peacekeeping has been consistent since Canadians embraced peacekeeping in the late 1950s”. Since the Suez Crisis, Canadian foreign policy has fit a peacekeeping rubric. Americans, however, were seen to fight wars, but Canadians pictured themselves as working for peace. Canada never had a reputation for starting wars but instead was seen to {{come to the aid of}} war-torn countries.|$|E

Up until 1580 Achuthappa Nayak co- ruled with his father under the Yuvaraja title while immediately after that he was joined by his heir-son Raghunatha Nayak. He was said to <b>be</b> <b>deeply</b> religious and was well considered a master {{in the art of}} warfare. His minister was Govinda Dikshitar, a great scholar and a shrewd administrator. His long reign was of comparative peace apart from the internal struggles enabling him to contribute much to spiritual and public utility development.|$|E

The AGOA program has helped created ten {{of thousands of jobs}} for middle class Malagasy especially in apparel manufacturing factories, it is feared that most of these jobs will be lost in the near future.

25|$|During World War I, the 43-year-old Merriam {{joined the}} U.S. Army Signal Corps, was {{commissioned}} a captain, and {{served on the}} federal government's Aviation Examining Board for the Chicago region. He was also on the federal government's Committee on Public Information, an independent government agency created to influence U.S. public opinion and encourage American participation in World War I. From April to September 1918, he was American High Commissioner for Public Information in Rome, Italy, where he developed propaganda designed to sway Italian public opinion. His mission was not only to encourage the Italian public to keep Italy {{in the war on}} the Allied side but also to undermine support for socialist and communist political parties. He may even have used Rockefeller Foundation money to help convince socialist leader Benito Mussolini to support the war. During his time in Rome, however, Merriam usurped the prerogatives of the U.S. ambassador and embassy staff, and his repeated clashes caused him to be sent back to the United States after just six months in the post. Merriam claimed to <b>be</b> <b>deeply</b> shaken by his experiences in Italy, although he did not make clear in what way his views had changed. He also engaged in an extra-marital affair while overseas, which led to marital problems.|$|E
25|$|Elisabeth Rynning, a {{professor}} of medical law at the University of Uppsala, questioned whether the court had been {{fully aware of the}} relevant laws. Access to these kinds of records may only be granted for the purpose of research or for the collection of statistics. Elinder had not stated any such purpose in his application, and Kärfve had only argued that the material would be useful for her research, not that it would actually be used in a research project. She was in fact not allowed to use the material in her research project, since that would have required a previous approval by an ethics committee. There was also the problem that Elinder and Kärfve requested the material as private citizens, {{while at the same time}} stating that they needed it in their professional capacities. If they had requested the material as representatives of their employers, the court would not have jurisdiction. Finally Rynning questioned how the court could decide that no one would be hurt, as the law requires, if Elinder and Kärfve were given full access to the data. Several participants had testified to the court that they would <b>be</b> <b>deeply</b> offended and hurt if Elinder and Kärfve could read their medical records.|$|E
