The two developed a friendly relationship, and Leahy wrote in his memoirs: [...] "General Sir Hastings Ismay <b>became</b> <b>my</b> favorite, perhaps because his position closely paralleled my own".|$|E

One afternoon, Jack watched spin bowler Arthur Mailey in the North Sydney {{practice}} nets {{and managed to}} describe the famous bowler's 'Bosie' action {{in a letter to}} Bill. O'Reilly claims to have perfected the action of changing the spin from anticlockwise to clockwise without any discernible hand movement within a couple of days.

500|$|Oates {{was one of}} the NHL's great playmakers, a {{style that}} he credits his father as encouraging: [...] "It was just kind of our family talks: 'If you can be unselfish, your {{teammates}} will always like you.' And it just kind of <b>became</b> <b>my</b> role, where I was obviously trying to please my dad, growing up and becoming a playmaker out of that." [...] Oates' father, a British immigrant, idolized Stanley Matthews, considered one of the greatest soccer players of all time and hoped that his son would adopt a pass-first mentality similar to Matthews.|$|E
500|$|The Last Exit {{was also}} notable {{as a popular}} {{destination}} for Seattle's amateur and professional Go and chess players including Peter Biyiasas, Viktors Pupols, and Yasser Seirawan, who wrote of the venue, [...] "Those first chess lessons soon {{led me to the}} legendary Last Exit on Brooklyn coffee house, a chess haven where an unlikely bunch of unusual people congregates to do battle." [...] Interviewed by Sports Illustrated in 1981, Seirawan described the Last Exit as [...] "Scrabble players, backgammon players, chess and game hustling... This <b>became</b> <b>my</b> home.

500|$|The album's {{title and}} opening track, [...] "Dance Again", {{was written by}} RedOne, Enrique Iglesias, Bilal [...] "The Chef", AJ Junior and Pitbull, who is also {{featured}} in the song. After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' <b>became</b> <b>my</b> anthem ... an expression of what I needed to do at that time in my life and for what I was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that <b>became</b> <b>my</b> reality." ...|$|E

500|$|In the mid-1940s Williamson {{continued}} {{to pursue his}} interest in cartooning and began to take art classes with Tarzan cartoonist Burne Hogarth, and later at Hogarth's Cartoonists and Illustrators School. There he met future cartoonists Wally Wood and Roy Krenkel. According to Williamson, [...] "Roy broadened my collecting horizons, he <b>became</b> <b>my</b> guide to all the great illustrators — the artists who directly influenced adventure cartoonists like [...] Raymond and [...] Foster. He showed me J.C. Coll, Franklin Booth, Joseph Franke, Dan Smith, Norman Lindsay, Fortunino Matania, and the great Blue Book illustrators like Herbert Morton Stoops and Frank Hoban." [...] As he {{continued to}} learn about the cartooning field, he would visit the comic-book publisher Fiction House, meeting such artists as George Evans, Bob Lubbers, John Celardo, and Mort Meskin.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, Pacino {{starred in}} Israel Horovitz's The Indian Wants the Bronx at the Astor Place Theater, playing Murph, a street punk.

Pacino won an Obie Award for Best Actor for his role, with John Cazale winning for Best Supporting actor and Horowitz for Best New Play. Martin Bregman saw the play and became Pacino's manager, a partnership that became fruitful {{in the years to}} come, as Bregman encouraged Pacino to do The Godfather, Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon. [...] "Martin Bregman discovered me off Broadway. I was 26, 25. And he discovered me and <b>became</b> <b>my</b> manager. And that's why I'm here.

500|$|Olds {{was known}} for the extravagantly waxed (and decidedly non-regulation) {{handlebar}} moustache he sported in Vietnam. It was a common superstition among airmen to grow a [...] "bulletproof mustache", but Olds also used his as [...] "a gesture of defiance. The kids on base loved it. Most everybody grew a mustache." [...] Olds started the mustache {{in the wake of}} the success of Operation Bolo and let it grow beyond regulation length because [...] "It became the middle finger I couldn't raise in the PR photographs. The mustache <b>became</b> <b>my</b> silent last word in the verbal battles...with higher headquarters on rules, targets, and fighting the war." [...] Returning home, however, marked the end of this flamboyance. When he reported to his first interview with Air Force Chief of Staff General John P. McConnell, McConnell walked up to him, stuck a finger under his nose and said, [...] "Take it off." [...] Olds replied, [...] "Yes, sir." ...|$|E

500|$|Alex Garland, {{a long-time}} friend of Ishiguro, asked the author {{for the rights}} to the novel before he had {{finished}} reading it. Before the novel was published in 2005, Garland had already written a script for a possible film. He gave the screenplay to two producers, Andrew Macdonald and Allon Reich, and development started at that moment. [...] "We are delighted to be shooting this special project, which Alex Garland first brought to us before the book's publication in 2005." [...] The script for the film was 96 pages long, and divided into chapters. Director Mark Romanek was originally attached to The Wolfman, but when he was dropped from that production for an unknown reason, he accepted the offer to work on Never Let Me Go. The movie was made into a dystopian drama. Romanek was glad to get the opportunity to shoot this film: [...] "From the moment I finished [...] the novel, it <b>became</b> <b>my</b> dream to film it. Ishiguro's conception is so daring, so eerie and beautiful. Alex Garland's adaptation is sensitive and precise. The cast is perfect, the crew superb." [...] The Seattle Times observed that the project was [...] "something of a departure" [...] for the novelist, noting that it merges Ishiguro's signature [...] "elegant prose with a decidedly science-fiction theme".|$|E
