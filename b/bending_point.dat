6000|$|Hence {{it follows}} that the utmost power of art can only be given in a {{material}} capable of receiving and retaining the influence of the subtlest touch of the human hand. That hand is the most perfect agent of material power existing in the universe; and its full subtlety can only be shown when the material it works on, or with, is entirely yielding. The chords of a perfect instrument will receive it, but not of an imperfect one; the softly <b>bending</b> <b>point</b> of the hair pencil, and soft melting of colour, will receive it, but not even the chalk or pen point, still less the steel point, chisel, or marble. The hand of a sculptor may, indeed, be as subtle as that of a painter, but all its subtlety is not bestowable nor expressible: the touch of Titian, Correggio, or Turner, [Footnote: See Appendix IV., [...] "Subtlety of Hand."] is a far more marvellous piece of nervous action than can be shown in anything but colour, or in the very highest conditions of executive expression in music. In proportion as the material worked upon is less delicate, the execution necessarily becomes lower, and the art with it. This is one main principle of all work. Another is, that whatever the material you choose to work with, your art is base if it does not bring out the distinctive qualities of that material.|$|E

The pendulum rod is hung from a short straight suspension spring attached to a sturdy support directly behind the anchor.

While exact and asymptotic sum-rate results are well known, the problem of obtaining intuitive analytical results for medium signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) is still not solved. In this paper, we propose the <b>bend</b> <b>point,</b> which quantifies the transition between low and high SNR; i. e., the beginning of the high SNR region. We derive the <b>bend</b> <b>point</b> for MU-MIMO with zero-forcing precoding and show that it is intimately related to the intercept of the high SNR asymptote with the zero sum-rate line. Using this result, we obtain a new approximation of the sum-rate at the <b>bend</b> <b>point</b> [...] -providing a useful rule of thumb for the effect of increasing the number of antennas at medium SNR.

50|$|Most {{flat roof}} systems are {{designed}} with a slight pitch to shed water off the sides, usually into a scupper system or into an internal drainage system. When a scupper or drain is clogged or fails for other reasons, storm water tends to pool around that low area. Over time, with each passing storm, {{the weight of the}} storm water will deflect the structural system beyond the structures <b>bending</b> <b>point,</b> thus allowing a bigger puddle to form. As a bigger puddle forms more weight is applied to the structural system causing more bending, allowing an even bigger puddle, then more weight, until the structure fails.|$|E
50|$|The Three-Roll Push Bending (TRPB) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used freeform-bending process to manufacture bending geometries consisting of several plane bending curves. Nevertheless, a 3D-shaping is possible. The profile is guided between bending-roll and supporting-roll(s), while being pushed through the tools. The position of the forming-roll defines the bending radius. The <b>bending</b> <b>point</b> is the tangent-point between tube and bending-roll. To change the bending plane, the pusher rotates the tube around its longitudinal axis. Generally, a TRPB tool kit can be applied on a conventional rotary draw bending machine. The process is very flexible since with a unique tool set, several bending radii values Rm can be obtained, although the geometrical precision of the process is not comparable to rotary draw bending. Bending contours defined as spline- or polynomial-functions can be manufactured.|$|E
5000|$|In the Riefler escapement, {{the energy}} {{required}} to keep the pendulum swinging is instead supplied by bending the short straight spring strip which suspends the pendulum. [...] The {{upper end of the}} suspension spring is not attached to a fixed support as in most clocks, but instead is attached to a heavy metal bearer, which pivots on two aligned knife-edges on its underside which rest on flat agate plates. The <b>bending</b> <b>point</b> of the suspension spring is in alignment with the line of contact of the knife-edges. When the pendulum passes its bottom point, the escape wheel is unlocked and pushes the bearer, and the bearer pivots suddenly on its knife edges by a small angle, flexing the spring. The spring is bent by a small amount in addition to that caused by the swing of the pendulum, and thus provides the impulse for the next swing. So the suspension spring is used for two functions: suspending the pendulum and giving it impulse.|$|E

Those parameters are larger than Takahira, Tasker and Habe (2014) (paper I) in which the colliding system showed a partial gaseous arc morphology that supports the NANTEN observations of objects indicated to be colliding MCs by numerical simulations. Gas clumps with density greater than 10 ^- 20 g cm^- 3 were identified as pre-stellar cores and tracked through the simulation to investigate the effect of mass of colliding clouds and collision speeds on the resulting core population. Our results demonstrate that smaller cloud property is more important for results of cloud cloud collisions. The mass function of formed cores can be approximated by a power law relation with index γ = - 1. 6 in slower cloud cloud collisions (v ∼ 5 km/s), in good agreement with observation of MCs. A faster relative velocity increases the number of cores formed in the early stage of collisions and shortens gas accretion phase of cores in the shocked region, leading to suppression of core growth. The <b>bending</b> <b>point</b> appears in the high mass part of the core mass function and the <b>bending</b> <b>point</b> mass decreases with increasing of the collision velocity for the same combination of colliding clouds.

40|$|Flexible {{grasping}} organs {{like the}} trunk of elephants and the grasping tail of spider monkeys {{have to deal with}} a high degree of movement freedom in their goal-directed movements. The aim of this study was to find the basic organisation principles they apply in order to lower the coordination expense of their movements. Therefore, in hypothesis I a reduction of the degree of movement freedom was postulated whereas hypothesis II assumed a specialization of movements towards one side. Since trunk and tail functionally and anatomically differ from each other, similarities in their kinematics should condense the basic organisation principles. In part I of the study, the kinematics of the trunk movements in 9 feeding female African elephants (Loxodonta africana) were analysed using Peak 5 Motion Analysis System. In &# 8220;reaching&# 8221;, the <b>bend</b> <b>point</b> of the trunk was coordinated along a straight line towards the target until it formed a functional joint around which the distal functional segment whip-like swung forward. The grip formation of the trunk hand was shifted toward &# 8220;object contact&# 8221;. In &# 8220;retrieval&# 8221;, a &# 8220;successive bending mechanism&# 8221; shortened the lever arm for an efficient transport of the distal trunk part against gravity. Thus, the trunk replaced costly permanent muscle coordination by applying physical laws. In part II, the kinematics of the grasping tail of four brachiating female spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) were observed in the same way. Swinging forward, the tail moved as an inverse double pendulum with a <b>bend</b> <b>point</b> as functional joint between a stable proximal and a more flexible distal functional segment. When grasping the substrate, the pendulum-like mechanics were modified towards a double pendulum by creating a <b>bend</b> <b>point</b> in the middle of the tail. This raised the centre of body mass, adjusted the <b>bend</b> <b>point</b> for its next forward swing and simultaneously increased the contact time of the distal functional segment with the substrate. In part III, the side preferences of trunk movements of 41 free ranging Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) were analysed with Observer (Video Analysis). All individuals showed a strong side preference in object contact and a weaker one in reaching and retrieval. Females showed stronger biases towards one side than males. The duration of trunk movements decreased with increasing strength of side preference. Trunk and grasping tail drastically reduced the degree of movement freedom with creating a <b>bend</b> <b>point.</b> Both flexible grasping organs applied mechanical laws to transport their effector towards the target more efficiently.

Methods: Twenty adult patients with bimaxillary dentoalveolar protrusion had the four first premolars extracted. Miniscrews were placed to provide maximum anchorage for upper incisor retraction and intrusion. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed after placement of the miniscrews and treatment.
