5|$|The bicycle {{made for}} Peter Van Petegem in 2004 was a Time. The {{distance}} from <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> to rear axle was 419mm {{rather than his}} normal 403. The distance from the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> to the front hub was 605mm instead of 600mm. The depth of the front forks was 372mm instead of 367.5mm The forks were spaced to take 28mm tyres. The sprockets were steel rather than alloy and the steerer column was cut 5mm higher than usual to raise the handlebars if needed before the start.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 2009, it was {{announced}} by the Comisión de Box y Lucha Libre Mexico D.F. that Poder Mexica had been stripped of the Mexican National Trios Championship because Black Warrior had left CMLL, breaking up the team. At the same time, they announced an eight-team tournament to crown a new trios champion. The {{top half of the}} bracket took place on December 22, 2009 and {{the bottom half of the}} bracket took place on December 29. In the top bracket the team of Máscara Dorada, Stuka, Jr. and Metro defeated Guerreros Tuareg (Arkangel de la Muerte, Loco Max, and Skándalo) in the first round and Los Cancerberos del Infierno (Virus, Euforia, and Pólvora) in the second round to qualify for the finals. The <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> took place on December 29, 2009 and saw the team of Poder Mexica (Sangre Azteca, Dragón Rojo, Jr., and Misterioso, Jr.) defeat Fabian El Gitano, Máximo, and Rouge, and then Delta, Leono, and Valiente to qualify for the final. On January 6, 2010 Máscara Dorada, Stuka, Jr. and Metro defeated Poder Mexica to become the new Mexican National Trios Champions.|$|E
25|$|An {{eccentric}} hub or <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> {{allows the}} off center axle or <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> spindle to pivot {{and change the}} chain tension.|$|E
50|$|A {{pin spanner}} {{is used on}} {{adjustable}} <b>bottom</b> <b>brackets.</b> Note that ISIS Drive <b>bottom</b> <b>brackets</b> need a separate tool (see below).|$|R
50|$|Designed {{titanium}} stems, seat posts, <b>bottom</b> <b>brackets,</b> bar ends, {{fork and}} other components.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bottom</b> <b>brackets</b> {{have several}} key size parameters: spindle length, shell width, and shell diameter.|$|R
25|$|The <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> {{shell is}} a short and large {{diameter}} tube, relative to the other tubes in the frame, that runs side to side and holds the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket.</b> It is usually threaded, often left-hand threaded on the right (drive) side of the bike to prevent loosening by fretting induced precession, and right-hand threaded on the left (non-drive) side. There are many variations, such as an eccentric <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket,</b> which allows for adjustment in tension of the bicycle's chain. It is typically larger, unthreaded, and sometimes split. The chain stays, seat tube, and down tube all typically connect to the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> shell.|$|E
25|$|Even newer designs {{have the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> spindle, usually hollow and larger {{diameter}} than {{is possible for}} bottom brackets with bearings held inside the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> shell of a bike frame, for reduced weight and increased stiffness, permanently attached to the right crank (Shimano and others) or the left crank (Race Face). The left crank slides onto a spline and is tightened {{with one or more}} pinch bolts (Shimano) or is pressed onto a spline by a bolt on the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> spindle (Race Face).|$|E
25|$|See the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> {{article for}} more details.|$|E
50|$|Titanium {{has been}} used {{in an effort to make}} <b>bottom</b> <b>brackets</b> lighter, but early {{attempts}} were not entirely successful. Several manufacturers have built <b>bottom</b> <b>brackets</b> with titanium spindles and alloy cups but their durability was lower than that of steel. Early Campagnolo Super Record titanium spindles (which were hollow) were replaced by a later version that used solid, nutted spindles for improved reliability.|$|R
2500|$|Placing thin spacers {{under the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket's</b> {{right-hand}} cup (Sturmey-Archer make a suitable 1/16" [...] spacer) {{to move the}} chainring outboard ...|$|R
50|$|Several {{different}} competing {{standards for}} splined interfaces exist. The tool for installing and removing these <b>bottom</b> <b>brackets</b> is often also a spline.|$|R
25|$|Certain {{companies}} such as Cannondale (BB30 open standard, introduced in 2000) have made their own unique <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> standards requiring changes in the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> shell of the bicycle frame {{in order to accommodate}} the bottom bracket/crank design. The open BB30 standard is gaining popularity on high end bicycle and component manufacturers (Zipp, Specialized, FSA).|$|E
25|$|Older cranks use a {{wedge-shaped}} pin, {{called a}} cotter, for {{attachment to the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> spindle.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of methods used to attach the cranks to the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> spindle (or axle).|$|E
50|$|Certain parts, {{especially}} springs, cables, <b>bottom</b> <b>brackets,</b> {{and spring}} anchor plates, are under extreme tension. Injuries can occur if parts under tension are removed.|$|R
50|$|In general use, {{the term}} 'three piece' {{refers to the}} former design, with sealed <b>bottom</b> <b>brackets</b> being seen as the 'standard'. Designs {{utilizing}} separate bearings are usually found on low end bikes, due to the low cost.|$|R
5000|$|One-piece cranks {{are easily}} {{maintained}} and reliable, but heavy. They are found on BMX bikes {{as well as}} low-end road and mountain bikes. They fit only frames with American sized (also known as [...] "Pro size") <b>bottom</b> <b>brackets.</b>|$|R
25|$|The two cranks, one on {{each side}} and usually mounted 180° apart, connect the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> axle to the pedals.|$|E
25|$|On some gearbox bicycles, the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> shell may be {{replaced}} by an integrated gearbox or a mounting location for a detachable gearbox.|$|E
25|$|The chain stays run {{parallel}} to the chain, connecting the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> shell to the rear fork ends or dropouts. When the rear derailleur cable is routed partially along the down tube, it is also routed along the chain stay. Occasionally (principally on frames made since the late 1990s) mountings for disc brakes will {{be attached to the}} chain stays. There may be a small brace that connects the chain stays in front of the rear wheel and behind the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> shell.|$|E
50|$|SRAM {{purchased}} Truvativ in 2004, providing SRAM {{with a line}} of cranks, <b>bottom</b> <b>brackets,</b> handlebars, stems, pedals, seatposts {{and chain}} retention systems. This allowed SRAM to offer a complete drivetrain with the first SRAM branded road groupsets being released the following year.|$|R
50|$|BMX 3-Piece <b>bottom</b> <b>brackets</b> {{typically}} use {{a spindle}} either 19(.05)mm (3/4") or 22 mm in diameter. In some cases these are splined {{and the number}} of splines depend on the manufacturer/model of the crankset, or in other cases the spindle is specific to the crankset.|$|R
50|$|The company manufactures, or has {{previously}} manufactured, wheelsets, hubs, brakes, mudguards, cassettes, chainrings, headsets, computers, chains, stems, bars, cranks, <b>bottom</b> <b>brackets,</b> and children's pedal cars, {{but it is}} best known for light alloy rims. Recently, the company has expanded into producing technical shoes and apparel for cyclists.|$|R
25|$|Bottom-bracket dynamos are {{attached}} between the chainstays behind the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> and are {{powered by a}} roller against the tire. These are easy to fit and do not wear the tire sidewall.|$|E
25|$|Finally, many children's {{bikes and}} older, or less-expensive bikes have {{one-piece}} ("Ashtabula") cranks {{where the two}} cranks and <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> spindle are forged as one piece of steel (see photograph above).|$|E
25|$|A {{cross frame}} {{consists}} mainly of two tubes that form a cross: a seat tube from the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> to the saddle, and a backbone {{from the head}} tube to the rear hub.|$|E

50|$|Wedges {{can also}} be used to hold objects in place, such as engine parts (poppet valves), bicycle parts (stems and {{eccentric}} <b>bottom</b> <b>brackets),</b> and doors. A wedge-type door stop (door wedge) functions largely because of the friction generated between the bottom of the door and the wedge, and the wedge and the floor (or other surface).|$|R
25|$|In general, U.S. and European cycle {{manufacturers}} used {{to assemble}} cycles {{from their own}} frames and components made by other companies, although very large companies (such as Raleigh) used to make almost every part of a bicycle (including <b>bottom</b> <b>brackets,</b> axles, etc.) In recent years, those bicycle makers have greatly changed their methods of production. Now, almost none of them produce their own frames.|$|R
25|$|The {{latest from}} Campagnolo, called Ultra-Torque, has each crank {{permanently}} attached to {{one half of}} the spindle (called semi-axles) which then join {{in the middle of the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> with a Hirth joint and a bolt.|$|E
25|$|Extensive butting is {{also used}} to create low weight tubes with {{acceptable}} stiffness. The early versions of the Fat Chance Titanium (1992 and 93 versions) had tubes of different diameters welded together to create a stiffer <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> area. The 1994 version had externally butted bottom tubes.|$|E
25|$|The cranks are {{pressed into}} place and {{prevented}} from squirming off via fretting by a bolt or nut installed into or onto the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> spindle. The head of the bolt or the nut sits inside a counterbore that is also threaded to accept a crank puller tool. The counterbore is often covered with a dust cover.|$|E
5000|$|... triple (Alpine) : Derailleurs {{designed}} {{to be used with}} cranksets having three chainrings, or with two chainrings that differ greatly in size. When viewed {{from the side of the}} bicycle, the inner cage plate extends further towards the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket's</b> center of rotation than the outer cage plate does. This is to help shift the chain from the smallest ring onto the middle ring more easily.|$|R
50|$|The Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1057, raised {{income tax}} rates once again. The <b>bottom</b> tax <b>bracket</b> was {{expanded}} but raised from 2% to 6%.|$|R
5000|$|Both frames were {{constructed}} of Reynolds 531 steel tubing (in French metric sizes), {{typical of the}} high-end bicycle during this era of manufacture. The front forks of later Mondia frames featured Bocama semi-sloping chrome-plated investment cast fork crowns with Mondia stamped into the shoulders on each side. <b>Bottom</b> <b>brackets</b> were either Swiss- or French-threaded, while headsets featured French threads and steerer bore. Although individual bicycles were built up with {{a great variety of}} components, the most common premium groupset was the Campagnolo [...] "Nuovo Record" [...] with [...] "Mafac" [...] brakesets.|$|R
