Cook went on to <b>beat</b> <b>his</b> first round score with 19points, while Lewis finished with 7points.|$|E
5|$|This result marked Manchester United's {{first defeat}} of 1999. It {{was the second}} {{consecutive}} year that Arsenal beat United to win the Charity Shield. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger described it as psychological boost to <b>beat</b> <b>his</b> opponents and felt the win showed that his team were ready for the upcoming season. United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, on the other hand, believed the defeat highlighted his players needed more game time.|$|E
5|$|Acqua & Sapone rider Dario Andriotto set {{the early}} time to beat. After a while, Yuriy Krivtsov bested his time. Several {{different}} riders in succession then posted successively (but, {{in the first}} few cases, marginally) better times than the best time that had come before them. Alessandro Bertolini, David Millar, Marco Pinotti, Giovanni Visconti, Bradley Wiggins, and Stefano Garzelli were all briefly the stage leader after they crossed the finish line. Bertolini in particular was stage leader for about three minutes, as Millar started just behind him and barely <b>beat</b> <b>his</b> time.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{continued}} to dominate possession once {{the second half}} got underway, but struggled {{to use it to}} their advantage. Lauren's cross from the right was cleared away by the United defence and Henry moments later miscued his effort aimed at goal. Moments later Ljungberg <b>beat</b> <b>his</b> marker and crossed the ball into the penalty area, only for Bergkamp to drag his shot wide. United threatened once the game reached the hour mark, winning duels and earning set-pieces. Gabriel Heinze's shot from about 20 yards tested Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in the 65th minute. Five minutes later Wenger substituted Reyes off in place of Pirès.|$|E
5|$|During Q3, contested {{by the top}} ten, Hamilton just <b>beat</b> <b>his</b> {{teammate}} to pole position, with a time set {{during his}} first timed lap. Both Ferrari drivers ran their first lap on used tyres {{in order to save}} one set for the race. In their second outing, Vettel was able to get ahead of the two Williams cars of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas, while teammate Kimi Räikkönen struggled with the handling of his car {{in the first part of}} the track to finish sixth on the grid.|$|E
5|$|In June, Lee {{participated in}} the Singapore Open losing in the quarter-finals. However, Lee bounced back winning the Indonesia Open, Malaysian Open Grand Prix Gold in July, and Macau Open in August. In late August, Lee {{suffered}} a shock exit in another attempt for the World Championships, but was beaten by Taufik Hidayat in the quarter-finals. Misbun cited that the loss {{was due to the}} back injury he picked-up after the match against Rajiv Ouseph in the third round. On 26 September, Lee <b>beat</b> <b>his</b> archrival Lin Dan in the Japan Open, the only title not taken by Chinese players in the tournament.|$|E

The meals eaten during this time are light and foods include labaneh, cheese, bread and fried or boiled eggs along with various liquids to drink. The muezzin's call to dawn prayers signaled the beginning of sawm or fasting.|$|E
5|$|Shepard and Margaret {{had five}} daughters and one son: Florence (1869–1869), Maria Louise (1870–1948), Edith (1872–1954), Marguerite (1873–1895), Alice (1874–1950) and Elliott Jr. (1877–1927). The {{children}} attended Sunday school and church, and were educated by private tutors and governesses. Shepard also employed a private chef for his family.

5|$|When {{the top ten}} drivers took to {{the track}} for {{the third and final}} part of qualifying, Nico Rosberg was able to <b>beat</b> <b>his</b> {{teammate}} Hamilton to pole position by 0.078 seconds, securing his fifth pole in a row. Third was Sebastian Vettel, ahead of Bottas, who would be demoted three places due to a penalty. Following a mistake on his last timed lap, Kimi Räikkönen finished fifth fastest, ahead of Nico Hülkenberg. Albeit racing with an updated power unit, Daniel Ricciardo qualified slower than teammate Daniil Kvyat, and a ten-place grid penalty for the change left him nineteenth on the grid.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62, {{knocking}} a {{ball from}} Wright onto his stumps, after attempting a sweep {{from a long}} hop. This brought Bradman in to join Barnes. Yardley surrounded the Australian captain with fielders and Laker <b>beat</b> <b>his</b> bat thrice in an over. Bedser was brought in with the leg trap again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads with the second new ball. The Australian captain decided to avoid the danger of being caught at short fine leg from a leg glance by padding the inswingers away with his front leg. Bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers, beating the outside edge of his bat {{three times in a}} row, narrowly missing the off stump on one occasion. Barnes responded by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the new ball.|$|E
5|$|As {{the top ten}} took to {{the track}} for the final part of qualifying, Nico Rosberg was unable to <b>beat</b> <b>his</b> time set in Q2 with his first fast lap. Hamilton however {{improved}} on his time, being more than three-tenths of a second faster than Rosberg. When both drivers were unable to improve on their times with their second timed laps, Hamilton took the 44th pole position of his career. Row two was {{taken up by the}} two Finns, Räikkönen and Valtteri Bottas, who narrowly beat the two Lotuses of Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado. Both Lotus drivers had emerged from their pit boxes simultaneously for their final timed laps, entering the track side-by-side. The two Red Bulls finished eighth and ninth, splitting the two Force India cars of Nico Hülkenberg and Sergio Pérez.|$|E

5|$|Big Hill {{was first}} used for the 1916 Winter Carnival, in which Nelsen set a hill record at 56meters (183ft). He <b>beat</b> <b>his</b> own record several times and kept the hill record until 1921. The tournament was {{gradually}} expanded, and by 1921 it cost $5,800 to arrange. That year, Henry Hall set a world length record in the hill, jumping 70meters (229ft). Three thousand spectators watched the games, in which many of the world's elite skiers competed. To accommodate the extra spectators, Canadian Pacific Railway stationed sleeping cars at Revelstoke to supplement the hotels. In 1922, Isabel Coursier debuted as Big Hill's first women jumper. In 1923, the tournament climaxed with 99 participating ski jumpers. In 1925, while sick with the flu, Nelsen beat Hall's world record by jumping 73meters (240ft). The record would remain until 1930.|$|E
5|$|Carlsen {{was born}} in Tønsberg, Norway, on 30 November 1990, to Sigrun Øen, a {{chemical}} engineer and Henrik Albert Carlsen, an IT consultant. The family spent one year in Espoo, Finland, and then in Brussels, Belgium, before returning to Norway in 1998, where they lived in Lommedalen, Bærum. They later moved to Haslum. Carlsen showed an aptitude for intellectual challenges at a young age: at two years, he could solve 50-piece jigsaw puzzles; at four, he enjoyed assembling Lego sets with instructions intended for children aged 10–14. His father taught him to play chess {{at the age of}} 5, although he initially showed little interest in the game. He has three sisters, and in 2010 he stated {{that one of the things}} that first motivated him to take up chess seriously was the desire to <b>beat</b> <b>his</b> elder sister at the game.|$|E
5|$|Drummond's wartime {{experience}} {{had given him}} a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—"he could move over ground without a single blade of grass rustling"—and the ability to incapacitate others—"he could kill a man with his bare hands in a second". During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man's land. Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player. In addition to Drummond's physical attributes is his common sense, which allows him to equal and <b>beat</b> <b>his</b> opponents, even if they have a superior intellect.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, Sorkin {{started using}} {{marijuana}} and cocaine. He {{has said that}} in cocaine he found a drug that gave him relief from certain nervous tensions he deals with on a regular basis. In 1995, he checked into rehab at the Hazelden Institute in Minnesota, {{on the advice of}} his then girlfriend and soon to be wife Julia Bingham, to try to <b>beat</b> <b>his</b> addiction to cocaine. In 2001, Sorkin along with colleagues John Spencer and Martin Sheen received the Phoenix Rising Award for their personal victories over substance abuse. However, two months later on April 15, 2001, Sorkin was arrested when guards at a security checkpoint at the Burbank Airport found hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack cocaine in his carry-on bag when a metal crack pipe set off the gate's metal detector. He was ordered to a drug diversion program.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{kicked off}} {{the second half of}} the season with defeat by Sony Dwi Kuncoro in the world meets, but went on to win the Macau Open in August. He reached the semi-final in the China Masters, but once again failed to <b>beat</b> <b>his</b> all time rival Lin Dan. Then, Lee participated in the Japan Open. He only managed to reach the second round of the Open, before winning the Hong Kong Open in November. His {{inconsistency}} saw him tumble down in the first round of the China Open. In December, Lee defended his Super Series Masters Finals title, which saw the competition played without the top badminton players in the world.|$|E
5|$|One of Chapman's first {{decisions}} was {{to bring}} in Sunderland striker Charlie Buchan, recognising Arsenal's lack of goal threat. Arsenal finished second in Chapman's first season, a marked improvement on previous seasons, though finished no higher as the 1920s drew to a close. Chapman continued to reshape his team and buy players to fit his desired system. He led Arsenal to their first major trophy, as they <b>beat</b> <b>his</b> former side Huddersfield Town 2–0 in the 1930 FA Cup Final. The team continued to mature and won the 1930–31 First Division title, scoring 127 goals in the process. Chapman won another championship in 1932–33, after Arsenal ended the previous season as league and 1932 FA Cup runners-up.|$|E
