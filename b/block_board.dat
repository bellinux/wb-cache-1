When Tom Bloch resigned to become a public school teacher, he was replaced by Richard Brown, who had formerly {{been one of the}} top executives of Ameritech. Dick Brown soon left to take the job as CEO of EDS, and the H&R <b>Block</b> <b>Board</b> of Directors appointed Frank Salizzoni, a member of the HRB Board, to serve as CEO of H&R Block. It was during Salizzoni's tenure as CEO that H&R Block's Board of Directors made the decision to divest CompuServe. Maury Cox left the helm as CompuServe's CEO, to be replaced by Bob Massey. Massey had a short tenure in this role, and was relieved in 1997. Frank Salizzoni became the acting CEO of CompuServe from this time until its sale.|$|E
50|$|The English {{lost only}} one ship, the {{captured}} Great Charity mentioned above. Eight Dutch ships were sunk by the English; six {{of these were}} burnt in two separate incidents when they got entangled while fleeing and set ablaze by a fire ship: this happened to the Tergoes entangling with the company ship the Maarseveen and the merchantman the Swanenburg; and also to the Koevorden, the Stad Utrecht and the Prinse Maurits. The earlier mentioned company ship the Oranje exploded after being set on fire by another fire ship following many an attempt to <b>block,</b> <b>board</b> and enter the Charles; {{in which she was}} prevented first by the Mary under captain Jeremiah Smith (the Mary would lose 99 men of its crew), one of York's seconds, and later by the Royal Oak, the Essex and the Royal Katherine. According to some the Oranje lost half of its crew of 400 before succumbing, a severely wounded Senten (rumoured to be an expatriate Scotsman) was picked up by an English vessel and shortly after succumbed himself. During the Dutch flight the English captured nine more ships: Hilversum, Delft, Zeelandia, Wapen van Edam and Jonge Prins; the VOC-ship Nagelboom and the merchants Carolus Quintus, Mars and Geldersche Ruyter. Tromp was captured but escaped. Eight older ships had to be written off later, as the costs of repair would have exceeded their value.|$|E

40|$|Zephyr board can be {{made from}} oil palm petiole, the waste from oil palm plantation. The {{objective}} {{of this study was to}} compare the quality of palm petiole zephyr board (PPZB) and the quality of several types of commercial biocomposite boards (plywood, <b>block</b> <b>board,</b> and particle board) available in market based on their physicalmechanical properties. PPZB that was compared was the zephyr board made from 3 layers of zephyr strands arranged crossly with urea formaldehyde adhesive. The target density was 0. 8 g cm⁻³, and the board size was 300 mm x 300 mm x 10 mm at a pressing temperature of 120 ⁰C, and a pressure of 25 kg cm⁻² for 10 minutes. The commercial composite boards were taken randomly from a hardware store. The results of the study showed that 3 -layer PPZB, plywood, <b>block</b> <b>board</b> and particle board each had the density of 0. 79 g cm⁻³, 0. 81 g. cm⁻³, 0. 40 g. cm⁻³ and 0. 67 g. cm⁻³, respectively. The respective average value of MOE of each board was 617. 6 (x 10 ² kg. cm⁻²), 728. 47 (x 10 ² kg. cm⁻²), 398. 74 (x 10 ² kg. cm⁻²) and 199. 22 (x 10 ² kg. cm⁻²), and that of MOR of each board was 405 kg cm⁻², 541 kg cm⁻², 207 kg cm⁻², and 119 kg cm⁻², while the screw holding strength of each was 88. 49 kg, 92 kg, 53. 6 kg and 61. 4 kg, respectively. ...|$|E
40|$|The general {{purposes}} of this study were to improve the efficiency of wood utilization and to create wood’s value added for plywood industry. To achieve the above purposes a strategy for Agro forestry Industry should be develop based on eco-efficiencyprinciples. The details of targets were: (1). to analyze critical factors in plywood industry management regarding to eco-efficiency implementation, (2) to analyze production technology that is used in plywood industry, and (3). to design a developing strategy of integrated plywood industry based on eco-efficiency principles. The result of this study show that the key factors for plywood management’s policy was environmental awareness; material utilization; and international issues. The production technology of all plywood industry in Indonesia is relatively similar. They are using the machineries of the 80 ’s and have the similar working procedures. The kinds of wood wastes generated from plywood industry were classified into log end, reject log end, green veneer waste, and others. The wood waste was calculated 49. 52 % released from 100 % input log in plywood industry. There are three strategy of integrated plywood industry based on eco-efficiency, namely (1) selecting and managing of environmental impact, showing three kinds of waste which affect the environment (2) Improvement the plywood manufacturing technology, showing the newinnovation technology or process control management and (3) Development of new product from wood waste.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of {{maintenance}} testing and diagnosis of faulty boards, a functional FSM (Finite State Machine) -based model for mixed-signal board has been introduced. The board is broken down into interconnected functional blocks. Each block has an associated functional model which describes its behavior and a test model which specifies how the block can be efficiently tested. A test model for a block is created by merging its functional model and a chosen test strategy. The board checking consists in testing each block individually using its test model and functional models of other blocks. Test patterns for a component are generated by covering the transitions of its test model and propagation to primary inputs/outputs through functional models of other <b>blocks.</b> The <b>board</b> test data set is built by using the test patterns for all the <b>blocks</b> of the <b>board.</b> The current improvement of the method deals with basic signals...|$|R
