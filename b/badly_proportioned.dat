5000|$|The Master of Alp Arslan appears briefly, {{at the end}} of the manuscript. His {{style is}} crude and unbalanced, his {{characters}} often <b>badly</b> <b>proportioned.</b>|$|E
50|$|Its {{official}} name was Volkswagen Type 147 Kleinlieferwagen (small van) {{but due to}} its funny and <b>badly</b> <b>proportioned</b> shape it was affectionately called Fridolin. From 1964 to July 1974, 6139 were produced, approximately 200 are preserved.|$|E
5000|$|Particular {{criticism}} has been levelled at the Crowne Plaza Hotel on Wellington Street {{as being a}} “missed opportunity” and “a bland exercise in facadism, complete with <b>badly</b> <b>proportioned</b> towers, archways and pediments, supposedly based upon earlier brick warehouses, architecture whose structural integrity it manages to both mimic and mock”. However, Dr Grady describes the Magistrates Court building as {{the highlight of the}} style. “I am sure in the future the courts will be a listed building. It is visually interesting, if a little eccentric, and is much better than the other buildings in this style that are rather bland.” ...|$|E

Hydro-cyanic acid in {{solution}} conducts very <b>badly.</b> The definite <b>proportion</b> {{of hydrogen}} (equal to that from water) was set free at the cathode, whilst at the anode a small quantity of oxygen was evolved and apparently {{a solution of}} cyanogen formed. The action altogether corresponded with that on a dilute muriatic or hydriodic acid. When the hydrocyanic acid was made a better conductor by sulphuric acid, the same results occurred.|$|R
5000|$|The monolith, {{situated}} next to {{a channel}} {{of water in the}} bottom of the chasm, is covered in unfamiliar hieroglyphs [...] "consisting for the most part of conventionalized aquatic symbols such as fishes, eels, octopuses, crustaceans, mollusks, whales, and the like." [...] There are also [...] "crude sculptures" [...] depicting: men—at least, a certain sort of men; though the creatures were shown disporting like fishes in the waters of some marine grotto, or paying homage at some monolithic shrine which appeared to be under the waves as well... They were damnably human in general outline despite webbed hands and feet, shockingly wide and flabby lips, glassy, bulging eyes, and other features less pleasant to recall. Curiously enough, they seemed to have been chiseled <b>badly</b> out of <b>proportion</b> with their scenic background; for one of the creatures was shown in the act of killing a whale represented as but little larger than himself.|$|R
30|$|Of these 17 studies, 8 studies {{reported}} on implant survival in non-vascularised bone grafts and 14 {{studies reported}} on implant survival in vascularised bone grafts with 5 studies (Barrowman et al. [7], Hessling et al. [28], Watzinger et al. [29], Shaw et al. [31], Chiapasco et al. [33]), therefore reporting on implant survival in both non-vascularised and vascularised bone grafts within their study (Table  3). Implant survival {{appears to be}} higher for those implants placed into vascularised bone grafts in comparison to non-vascularised bone grafts. Of the five studies reporting on both vascularised and non-vascularised bone grafts, three of these studies (Barrowman et al. [7], Watzinger et al. [29], Chiapasco et al. [33]) reported higher implant survival in vascularised bone grafts whereas the other two studies (Hessling et al. [28], Shaw et al. [31]) reported higher implant survival in non-vascularised bone grafts. Shaw et al. [31] reported that implants placed into ‘vascularized bone graft were superior to non-vascularized bone. In particular, those implants in composite radial forearm flaps performed <b>badly.</b> With the <b>proportion</b> of patients with implant loss in these bone flaps within their study being 27 % in iliac crest, 33 % in fibula, and 100 % in radius and that implants placed in composite fibula and iliac crest flaps performed approximately {{as well as in}} native maxilla within their study’ [31].|$|R
30|$|Twelve studies {{reported}} {{on the use of}} more than one autogenous bone graft donor site within their study (Barrowman et al. [7], Schultes et al. [15], Yerit et al. [16], Fenlon et al. [19], Chiapasco et al. [23], Buddula et al. [24], Fierz et al. [25], Burgess et al. [27], Hessling et al. [28], Watzinger et al. [29], Shaw et al. [31] and Chiapasco et al. [33]); of these, five {{studies reported}} on the effect of the autogenous bone graft donor site on implant survival. Two studies (Fenlon et al. [19], Burgess et al. [27]) reported no significant effect on implant survival in varying graft donor sites; however, three studies (Hessling et al. [28], Shaw et al. [31], Chiapasco et al. [33]) reported varying implant survival rates within different autogenous bone grafts but only one study (Hessling et al. [28]) reported that implant loss was significant with this being for implants placed into fibula bone grafts. Shaw et al,. [31] reporting that implants placed into ‘vascularized bone graft were superior to non-vascularized bone. In particular, those implants in composite radial forearm flaps performed <b>badly.</b> With the <b>proportion</b> of patients with implant loss in these bone flaps within their study being 27 % in iliac crest, 33 % in fibula, and 100 % in radius and that implants placed in composite fibula and iliac crest flaps performed approximately as well as in native maxilla within their study’ [31].|$|R
