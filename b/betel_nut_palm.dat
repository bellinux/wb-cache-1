40|$|<b>Betel</b> <b>nut</b> or <b>betel</b> <b>palm</b> (Areca catechu Linn) {{has become}} a major cash crop in {{southern}} and central Taiwan since the mid- 1980 s. Many slopeland fruit orchards and forests have been converted to <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> plantations. The total area of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> plantations has increased over the past 30 years, reaching a peak of 56 542 ha in 1997. The public and conservation groups frequently express great concern over the potential negative hydrological impacts of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> plantations oil steep slopes. This investigation in central Taiwan examines the effects of hillslope <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> plantations on hydrological processes. Differences in hydrological characteristics between plots planted with <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> trees and those with other ground cover types were evaluated at two study sites. The tall, single-layer canopy and wide spacing between planted <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> trees led to low interception losses, high throughfall and high net rainfall. Plots planted with <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> trees had lower infiltration, higher surface runoff and higher erosion than forested sites. These hydrological characteristics can be related to factors such as crown cover, soil organic content and soil porosity in <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> plantations. Strearnflow data from three gauged watersheds with different proportions of total area planted with <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> showed that where greater proportions of total area were planted with <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> trees, there were higher annual stream flow/rainfall ratios, higher specific peak flows, steeper recessions and higher peak flow/baseflow ratios.

Above an elevation of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft), the forest becomes predominantly subtropical, with a predominance of temperate-forest trees such as oaks, conifers and rhododendrons. Sal woodland is also found across central Bangladesh, particularly in the Bhawal National Park. The Lawachara National Park is a rainforest in northeastern Bangladesh.

40|$|UnrestrictedBetel nut chewing is {{a social}} {{practice}} that articulates boundaries. The history of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> chewing in Southern China indexes {{the ways in which}} non-Han minorities were sinicized, demonstrating how <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> chewing culture was appropriated by Han nobles, and variously incorporated into Han cultural expressions in the southern region.; In Taiwan <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> chewing marks boundaries between groups in terms of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and gender. The stigmatization of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> in Taiwan is explained by political, economic, and historical factors related to the Japanese colonial prohibition and KMT neglect of the <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> industry. Ethnic, gender and socioeconomic status was articulated by a re-introduced commoditized practice of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> chewing. Marketing strategies involving "betel nut beauties" developed in the <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> retailing business, since most <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> chewers were men. The industry functioned as a "shadow economy. " The symbolic nature of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> among the "Indigenous <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> chewing cultures" of southeastern Taiwan articulates themes of cultural prosperity and wealth. Tourism development is based on cultivating Indigenous cultural capital.; In Hainan <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> chewing marks boundaries between locals and outsiders. The Utsat, a Muslim Austronesian-language speaking people and Li language-speaking peoples in rural villages provide non-Han perspectives within Hainan. Interethnic relations among Han and non-Han are marked by salient cultural differences, though all share a <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> chewing culture. The use of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> in weddings shows continued social and symbolic significance. <b>Betel</b> <b>nut</b> production and retailing remains integrated in the traditional economy. Modern tourism development restricts <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> chewing, but local <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> chewers respond by further embodying the habit.; A comparative analysis of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> chewing cultures in Taiwan and Hainan reveals internal boundaries marked in Taiwan, and outsider/insider status marked in Hainan. Analysis of the symbolic nature of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> and the process of chewing is found to relate to gendered complementary practice at its root, and extends to various expressions of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> in its social and ritual forms. The "choice" to chew or not arises from the socially constructed nature of chewing "appetites," and shows how modern habits and traditional rituals of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> chewing cultures coexist and interrelate with each other differently in Taiwan and Hainan...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Background: The {{cultural}} practice of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> chewing with known detrimental health effects {{has become more}} geographically widespread through migration, and subsequently, global disease patterns have changed. Immigrants {{are at risk for}} oral health and multi system diseases due to continued patterns of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> use. Although legal in the U. S., {{little is known about the}} availability, purchasing patterns, and regulation of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> products. We documented the availability of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> and the consumer experience of buying <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> in King County, Washington. Methods: We created a census sample of all Asian stores in King County, Washington through an internet search and in person store visits. We used a Secret Shopper design method to identify all stores that sold <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> products and to document consumer experience and buying conditions of <b>betel</b> <b>nut.</b> We examined product pricing, labeling and marketing information of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> products purchased and developed a Product Information Score to evaluate products warning and consumer information properties. Results: Twenty-seven Asian stores (42 %) sold <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> products in King County. We identified 60 different types of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> products: 67 % did not have warning labels, 22 % had promotional advertising, 30 % were marketed to children. No stores had warning signs about <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> health risks, and all <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> products without tobacco were available for self selection by consumers. Gutka was sold in 26 % of stores and all gutka products were sold behind the counter. All regions of the Seattle metropolitan area contained stores that sold <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> and regions of greater Asian population density had more <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> stores. Conclusion: <b>Betel</b> <b>nut</b> is widely available, accessible, and inexpensive in King County, Washington. Stores inadequately warn consumers of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> health risks due to lack of in store warning signs, lack of age requirements for purchasing, easy access to most products, and limited product package warning information. Policy changes are needed to better regulate the <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> market for consumer protection. <b>Betel</b> <b>nut</b> awareness campaigns are needed to promote prevention and cessation of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> use in order to reduce poor health outcomes among <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> users...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fibers {{obtained}} from the fronds of <b>betel</b> or <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> (Areca catechu) <b>palm</b> (or known in Malaysia as pinang tree) were used as woven reinforcement in unsaturated polyester resin. The morphology, physical and mechanical properties of the natural fibers and resulting woven composites were evaluated. Woven betel palm composites were prepared in both untreated and treated forms with different fiber volumes: 3 %, 5 %, 7 %, and 9 %. The flexural properties and impact strength of woven betel palm composites improve {{with the addition of}} fiber up to 7 vol%. The drop in flexural properties was observed in 9 vol % of fiber due to insufficient resin to wet the fibers during the fabrication of composites. As expected, the treated betel palm fibers display better mechanical properties than those of the untreated system. From the SEM observation, it is found that the alkaline treatment of fibers effectively cleans the fiber surface and increases the fiber surface roughness. In general, mechanical properties of the woven composites made from alkali treated fibers were superior to the untreated fibers.
