2500|$|In 2002, Executive Producer Louise Berridge {{decided to}} {{reintroduce}} the character 8 {{years after she}} had last appeared. Auditions were held to cast the role to a professional actor; however, auditionees were not informed which character they were auditioning for. The first audition was a group workshop of 30 auditionees, who were asked to perform improvisations. After whittling down potential actors from 500 to 4, {{the second stage of}} the audition process was an interview with EastEnders Casting Director. The auditionees were asked to perform a monologue {{in front of a camera}} and do a screen test with one of the actors already in the show, Christopher Parker, who played Spencer Moon. 17-year-old actress Scarlett Johnson was cast: [...] "At the second audition they gave me a monologue to read, but they'd been really careful about it. They hadn't said what the character's name was, they didn't give away anything in the monologue that might tell me who I was auditioning for. So I didn't know until I got the part who I was going to be playing--I'd been guessing for ages!" [...] Asked how she felt when she knew she was playing Vicki Fowler, a character linked to the show's early history who is the daughter of 2 prominent original characters, Johnson said: [...] "I felt very honoured, but it was quite scary. I knew there'd <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> out there with expectations of what she'd be like. But it's good fun actually. It means you don't have to introduce yourself to everyone. You can really play with that [...] My family are EastEnders addicts, we've watched it our whole lives. I remember the first Vicki, I remember Michelle and I definitely remember Dirty Den! My knowledge of the show really helped a lot, because I didn't have to do any research into the character. When I joined the show, I felt like I was meeting the actors for a second time. I'd already met them in my home on TV, then I had to actually meet them in real life!" [...] The character made her reappearance in January 2003, turning up unexpectedly at her grandmother Pauline's (Wendy Richard) house.|$|E

You experiment, if you do, when you're younger. Then he decides he's not gay, and he's straight and likes women, so he tries to throw himself at different girls and see where it takes him."

5000|$|On January 1, 1968, WNEW placed Steele in the {{overnight}} [...] "graveyard shift" [...] which granted her more creative freedom, leading her to develop her on-air personality and rapport with her listeners. [...] "I thought there must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> ... that {{need something to}} relate to {{in the middle of}} the night, and if I could create some kind of camaraderie, a relationship between myself and the rest of the night people, then it would be more than just music". She thought of a new air name, based on the gender ("bird" [...] being slang for a girl) and her night owl hours of work, and chose The Nightbird.|$|E
5000|$|On November 19, 2012, it {{was officially}} {{announced}} that Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Lin Shaye, and Ty Simpkins would reprise their roles {{from the first}} film. The following month, {{it was announced that}} Barbara Hershey would also be returning. In February 2013, Jocelin Donahue and Lindsay Seim rounded out the cast as younger versions of Hershey and Shaye's characters, respectively. It was also confirmed that the film's screenwriter Leigh Whannell and actor Angus Sampson would reprise their roles as Specs and Tucker, respectively. When asked about the return of the two characters, Whannell explained, [...] "There was this hatred that spewed out from fans saying 'I hated those guys! They sucked! They ruined the movie!' so there will probably <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> out there who will be disappointed to hear that the Specs and Tucker characters will be coming back." ...|$|E
5000|$|Asked if {{the song}} was about drugs, Heartbreaker guitarist Mike Campbell said, [...] "In the verse {{there is still the}} thing about an Indiana girl on an Indiana night, just when it gets to the chorus he had the {{presence}} of mind to give it a deeper meaning. My take on it is it can be whatever you want it to <b>be.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> think it's a drug reference, and if that's what you want to think, it very well could be, but it could also just be a goodbye love song." [...] In the rest of the interview, Campbell said that {{the song was}} originally titled [...] "Indiana Girl" [...] and the first chorus [...] "Hey, Indiana Girl, go out and find the world." [...] He went on to say that their producer, Rick Rubin 'just couldn't get behind singing about [...] "hey, Indiana Girl,"' so Rubin changed the chorus a week later.|$|E

"Crimson and Clover" [...] {{was a huge}} success, and {{the group}} would have two {{follow-up}} hits that also reached the Hot 100's top 10, [...] "Sweet Cherry Wine" [...] and [...] "Crystal Blue Persuasion". James, who co-wrote {{all three of those}} songs, and his band did well enough with the transition to be invited to perform at Woodstock. James describes Artie Kornfeld's invitation like this: [...] "Artie was up and asked if you could play at this pig farm up in upstate New York." [...] I said, [...] "What?!?" [...] "Well, they say it's gonna <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> there, and it's gonna be a really important show." [...] At the time James was in Hawaii and was incredulous about being asked to travel 6,000 miles to play a show on an upstate New York pig farm, telling the Roulette Records secretary, [...] "If I'm not there, start without us, will you please?" [...] In 1970, after four minor hits, drugs almost killed James when, at a concert, he collapsed, and was pronounced dead. However, he survived, hated the recording studio, and moved up into the country to vegetate. That year, the Shondells, without James, disbanded.|$|E
