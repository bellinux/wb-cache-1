50|$|Triptans such as {{sumatriptan}} {{are effective}} for both pain and nausea {{in up to}} 75% of people. When sumatriptan is taken with naproxen it works better. They are the initially recommended treatments for those with moderate to severe pain or those with milder symptoms who {{do not respond to}} simple analgesics. The different forms available include oral, injectable, nasal spray, and oral dissolving tablets. In general, all the triptans appear equally effective, with similar side effects. However, individuals may respond better to specific ones. Most side effects are mild, such as flushing; however, rare cases of myocardial ischemia have occurred. They are thus not recommended for people with cardiovascular disease, who have had a stroke, or have migraines that are accompanied by neurological problems. In addition, triptans should be prescribed with caution for those with risk factors for vascular disease. While historically not recommended in those with <b>basilar</b> <b>migraines</b> there is no specific evidence of harm from their use in this population to support this caution. They are not addictive, but may cause medication-overuse headaches if used more than 10 days per month.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- There are {{conflicting}} reports about EEG {{findings of the}} migraineurs. In this study we report the ictal and interictal EEGs of 100 migraineurs in comparison with control group. The age range for patient and control groups were 9 - 48 and 10 - 46 years, respectively; 32 % of the patients were less than 14 years old and the remaining 68 % were more than 14 years.

40|$|Background: Sumatriptan tablets {{have been}} {{developed}} in a fast-disintegrating, rapid-release formulation designed to facilitate tablet disintegration and drug dispersion and to potentially mitigate the effects of gastric stasis that can accompany migraine. Objective: This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan 50 - and 100 -mg tablets in a fast-disintegrating, rapid-release formulation compared with those of placebo in patients with migraine. Methods: This clinical trial had a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design. Exclusion criteria included > 6 migraines monthly during either of the 2 months before screenings uncontrolled hypertension; suspected or confirmed cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, and ophthalmic, <b>basilar,</b> or hemiplegic <b>migraine.</b> Sumatriptan 50 and 100 mg and placebo were taken on an outpatient basis during the mild-pain phase of a single migraine attack. Patients recorded details of the treated migraine on a diary card and rated pain severity immediately before dosing and 30 minutes, 45 minutes, I hour, and 2 hours after dosing using a 4 -point scale (from 0 = none to 3 = severe). The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients who were pain free 2 hours after dosing. Additional efficacy end points were the proportion of patients who were pain free at 30 minutes, 45 minutes, and 1 hour after dosing, the proportion who were migraine free through 2 hours after dosing; and the proportion with a sustained pain-free response. Results: Patients' mean age ranged from 39. 7 to 41. 5 years across the 3 groups, and the majority were women (79. 7 %- 85. 9 %) and white (98. 7 %- 100 %). One hundred thirty-seven patients received sumatriptan 50 mg, 142 sumatriptan 100 mg, and 153 placebo. In the intent-to-treat population (n = 432), 51. 1 % of patients who received sumatriptan 50 mg and 66. 2 % of patients who received sumatriptan 100 mg were pain free 2 hours after dosing, compared with 19. 6 % of the placebo group (P < 0. 001, each sumatriptan dose vs placebo). In an exploratory analysis, the 2 -hour pain-free rate with sumatriptan 100 mg was significantly better than that with sumatriptan 50 mg (P = 0. 007). Significantly more patients who received sumatriptan 100 mg were pain free compared with placebo at 30 minutes (P < 0. 01), 45 minutes (P < 0. 001), and 1 hour after dosing (P < 0. 001); similar pain-free results were observed in patients who received sumatriptan 50 mg at 45 minutes (P < 0. 05) and 1 hour (P < 0. 01). In the per-protocol population (n = 313), pain-free efficacy 2 hours after dosing was 52. 7 % with sumatriptan 50 mg and 74. 8 % with sumatriptan 100 mg, compared with 21. 0 % with placebo (P < 0. 001, each sumatriptan dose VS placebo). These rates were greater than those in the overall study population, ∼ 12. 0 % of whom treated moderate or severe pain. The only drug-related adverse events reported in ≥ 3 % of patients in any treatment group were nausea and vomiting (< 1 %, 5 %, and 2 % in the sumatriptan 50 and 100 mg and placebo groups, respectively), chest symptoms (2 %, 3 %, and 0 %), and malaise and fatigue (1 %, 3 %, and < 1 %). No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: In this study, sumatriptan tablets in a fast-disintegrating, rapid-release oral formulation provided pain-free efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine. Efficacy was maximized with the 100 -mg dose compared with the 50 -mg dose, and by treating early when pain was mild. In the intent-to-treat population, 51. 1 % of patients who received sumatriptan 50 mg and 66. 2 % of those who received sumatriptan 100 mg were pain free 2 hours after dosing. In the per-protocol population, 3 of 4 patients taking the 100 -mg tablets for mild pain within 1 hour of its onset were pain free at 2 hours. Sumatriptan tablets were generally well tolerated.

These pathologies are mainly near the base of the brain and the hallucinations have gone away in patients that had their pathology corrected such as the removal of a tumor. The most commonly reported hallucinations are animals, people or children, scary or deformed faces and heads, landscapes, and people walking in a line.|$|E
50|$|The pain is {{frequently}} accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, sensitivity to smells, fatigue and irritability. In a <b>basilar</b> <b>migraine,</b> a migraine with neurological symptoms {{related to the}} brain stem or with neurological symptoms {{on both sides of}} the body, common effects include a sense of the world spinning, light-headedness, and confusion. Nausea occurs in almost 90% of people, and vomiting occurs in about one-third. Many thus seek a dark and quiet room. Other symptoms may include blurred vision, nasal stuffiness, diarrhea, frequent urination, pallor, or sweating. Swelling or tenderness of the scalp may occur as can neck stiffness.

50|$|Migraine with {{brainstem}} aura (abbreviated MBA) (previously used terms: basilar artery migraine; basilar migraine; basilar-type migraine) is a subtype of migraine with aura {{in which}} symptoms clearly originate from the brainstem, but no motor weakness. When motor symptoms are present, the subtype is coded as 1.2.3 Hemiplegic migraine. Originally the terms basilar artery migraine or <b>basilar</b> <b>migraine</b> were used but, since {{involvement of the}} basilar artery is unlikely, the term migraine with brainstem aura is preferred in ICHD-3 beta. There are typical aura symptoms {{in addition to the}} brainstem symptoms during most attacks. Many patients who have attacks with brainstem aura also report other attacks with typical aura and should be coded for both 1.2.1 Migraine with typical aura and 1.2.2 Migraine with brainstem aura. Many of the symptoms like dysarthria, vertigo, tinnitus, hypacusis, diplopia, ataxia and decreased level of consciousness may occur with anxiety and hyperventilation, and therefore are subject to misinterpretation. Serious episodes of migraine with brainstem aura can lead to stroke, coma, and death. Using triptans and other vasoconstrictors as abortive treatments for migraine with brainstem aura is contraindicated. Abortive treatments for migraine with brainstem aura address vasodilation and restoration of normal blood flow to the vertebrobasilar territory to restore normal brainstem function.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{report a}} rare case of benign {{paroxysmal}} vertigo (BPV) of childhood transitioning into <b>basilar</b> <b>migraine</b> (BM) that was effectively treated with lomerizine. A 6 -year-old male visited our hospital complaining of repeated attacks of vertigo for 3 months. The patient's vertigo attacks lasted {{for several hours}} and were accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intense fear and loss of consciousness. No nystagmus was observed during the vertigo attacks. Blood tests and imaging examinations revealed no abnormal findings. The results of electronystag-mography and the caloric test were unremarkable. Pure-tone audiometry revealed profound right-side sensorineural hearing loss. Among the differential diagnoses, delayed endolymphatic hydrops, epilepsy and BM were considered. Delayed endolym-phatic hydrops was considered unlikely since no nystagmus occurred during the vertigo attacks {{and there was no}} change in hearing; electroencephalography revealed no epileptic seizure waves. The attacks of vertigo were well-controlled with lomerizine. The patient was diagnosed with BM since the use of lomerizine, an agent for the treatment for migraine, was effective.

Presently, guidelines for the treatment of migraine do not address the use of combination products or products in combination for migraine management. 2 The American Academy of Neurology’s (AAN) evidence-based guidelines recommend linking the intensity of care for migraine headaches with the level of disability and symptoms, which is called stratified care. Accordingly, the guidelines recommend using of triptans as first-line therapy for the acute treatment of migraine in those whose symptoms are moderate to severe and in those who have mild to moderate migraine headaches that respond poorly to NSAIDs or other simple analgesics; for example, caffeine combinations.

40|$|This is a {{qualitative}} and chronological analysis of ictal and postictal symptoms, frequency of seizures, family history, response to treatment, and prognosis in nine patients with idiopathic occipital epilepsy and visual seizures. Ictal elementary visual hallucinations are stereotyped for each patient, usually lasting for seconds. They consist of mainly multiple, bright coloured, small circular spots, circles, or balls. Mostly, {{they appear in}} a temporal hemifield often moving contralaterally or in the centre where they may be flashing. They may multiply and increase in size {{in the course of}} the seizure and may progress to other non-visual occipital seizure symptoms and more rarely to extra-occipital manifestations and convulsions. Blindness occurs usually from the beginning and postictal headache, often indistinguishable from migraine, is common. It is concluded that elementary visual hallucinations in occipital seizures are entirely different from visual aura of migraine when individual elements of colour, shape, size, location, movement, speed of development, duration, and progress are synthesised together. Postictal headache does not show preference for those with a family history of migraine. Most of the patients are misdiagnosed as having migraine with aura, <b>basilar</b> <b>migraine,</b> acephalgic migraine, or migralepsy simply because physicians are not properly informed of differential diagnostic criteria.

Vogel (1974), Haslam (1973) stressed that, since the syndrome occurs in clear consciousness, it is obvious that there is no organic basis to the condition. It is rather a functional illness and as such is explained on a psychodynamic basis.

40|$|The use of {{instrumental}} examinations in headache patients varies widely. In order {{to evaluate their}} usefulness, the most common instrumental procedures were evaluated, {{on the basis of}} evidence from the literature, by an EFNS Task Force (TF) on neurophysiological tests and imaging procedures in non-acute headache patients. The conclusions of the TF regarding each technique are expressed in the following guidelines for clinical use. 1 Interictal electroencephalography (EEG) is not routinely indicated in the diagnostic evaluation of headache patients. Interictal EEG is. however, indicated if the clinical history suggests a possible diagnosis of epilepsy (differential diagnosis). Ictal EEG could be useful in certain patients suffering from hemiplegic and <b>basilar</b> <b>migraine.</b> 2 Recording of evoked potentials is not recommended for the diagnosis of headache disorders. 3 There is no evidence to justify the recommendation of autonomic tests for the routine clinical examination of headache patients. 4 Manual palpation of pericranial muscles, with standardized palpation pressure, can be recommended for subdividing patient groups but not for diagnosis. Pressure algometry and electromyography (EMG) cannot be recommended as clinical diagnostic tests. 5 In adult and paediatric patients with migraine, with no recent change in attack pattern, no history of seizures, and no other Focal neurological signs or symptoms, the routine use of neuroimaging is not warranted. In patients with atypical headache patterns, a history Of seizures and/or focal neurological signs or symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be indicated. 6 If attacks can be fully accounted for by the standard headache classification [International Headache Society (IHS) ], a positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and scan will generally be of no further diagnostic value. 7 Nuclear medicine examinations of the cerebral circulation and metabolism can be carried out in Subgroups of headache patients for diagnosis and evaluation of complications, when patients experience unusually severe attacks, or when the quality or severity of attacks has changed. 8 Transcranial Doppler examination is not helpful in headache diagnosis.

40|$|Background and purpose: A {{large number}} of {{instrumental}} investigations are used in patients with non-acute headache in both research and clinical fields. Although the literature has shown {{that most of these}} tools contributed greatly to increasing understanding of the pathogenesis of primary headache, they are of little or no value in the clinical setting. Methods: This paper provides an update of the 2004 EFNS guidelines and recommendations for the use of neurophysiological tools and neuroimaging procedures in non-acute headache (first edition). Even though the period since the publication of the first edition has seen {{an increase in the number}} of published papers dealing with this topic, the updated guidelines contain only minimal changes in the levels of evidence and grades of recommendation. Results: (i) Interictal EEG is not routinely indicated in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with headache. Interictal EEG is, however, indicated if the clinical history suggests a possible diagnosis of epilepsy (differential diagnosis). Ictal EEG could be useful in certain patients suffering from hemiplegic or <b>basilar</b> <b>migraine.</b> (ii) Recording evoked potentials is not recommended for the diagnosis of headache disorders. (iii) There is no evidence warranting recommendation of reflex responses or autonomic tests for the routine clinical examination of patients with headache. (iv) Manual palpation of pericranial muscles, with standardized palpation pressure, can be recommended for subdividing patient groups but not for diagnosis. Pain threshold measurements and EMG are not recommended as clinical diagnostic tests. (v) In adult and pediatric patients with migraine, with no recent change in attack pattern, no history of seizures, and no other focal neurological symptoms or signs, the routine use of neuroimaging is not warranted. In patients with trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia, neuroimaging should be carefully considered and may necessitate additional scanning of intracranial/cervical vasculature and/or the sellar/orbital/(para) nasal region. In patients with atypical headache patterns, a history of seizures and/or focal neurological symptoms or signs, MRI may be indicated. (vi) If attacks can be fully accounted for by the standard headache classification (IHS), a PET or SPECT scan will normally be of no further diagnostic value. Nuclear medical examinations of the cerebral circulation and metabolism can be carried out in subgroups of patients with headache for the diagnosis and evaluation of complications, when patients experience unusually severe attacks or when the quality or severity of attacks has changed. (vii) Transcranial Doppler examination is not helpful in headache diagnosis. Conclusion: Although many of the examinations described in the present guidelines are of little or no value in the clinical setting, most of the tools, including thermal pain thresholds and transcranial magnetic stimulation, have considerable potential for differential diagnostic evaluation as well as for the further exploration of headache pathophysiology and the effects of pharmacological treatment. © 2010 The Author(s).
