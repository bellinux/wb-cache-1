40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the improvement of}} two radically different cellulose materials, paper and artificial blood vessels, constructed from two diverse cellulose sources, wood pulp and Acetobacter xylinum. The improvement of both materials was possible due to the natural affinity of the hemicellulose xyloglucan for cellulose. Chemical and mechanical pulps were treated with xyloglucan in the wet-end prior to hand sheet formation or <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> <b>application</b> of dry hand sheets, loading a comparable amount of xyloglucan. The tensile strength increases for the wet-end treatment and spray application were 28 % and 71 % respectively for bleached soft wood, compared to untreated sheets (20. 7 Nm/g). The corresponding strength increases for hand sheets made of thermo-mechanical pulp were 6 % and 13 % respectively compared to untreated sheets (42. 4 Nm/g). The tendency for chemical pulp to be superior to mechanical pulp with respect to strength increase was valid even for tear strength and Scott-Bond. These results suggest, in agreement with other studies, that adhesion of xyloglucan to wood fibres is dependent on their degree of surface lignification.

To improve the quality and speed of this observation we developed an image processing technique and tested the efficacy of acetic acid and sodium chloride as chemical stimulants. Because of the lower standard error on the results obtained (0. 7 vs 1. 7), sodium chloride was eventually selected for all subsequent observations. The viability as observed with the image processing technique rose significantly with the time after the nematodes were suspended in water; however, viability as observed under the microscope was not influenced by the time. These differences {{can be attributed to the}} difference in type of stimulant (mechanical vs chemical) used. After nematodes had been in suspension for 3. 5 h, the viability as measured using the image processing system was still significantly lower than the viability as measured under the microscope. This difference did not disappear after 24 h at 4, 15 or 24 degrees C. Maintaining nematodes for 24 h at 35 degrees C significantly decreased the viability to 5. 9 % (microscope) or 11. 0 % (image processing technique). The decrease in viability as observed with the image processing system corresponded better with the decrease in infectivity (i. e., 13. 8 %).

The main experimental aims of the present study were to provide information on the fate and ecological effects of drift of the pesticides into surface water and {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} drift-reduction measures in mitigating risks. The pesticides selected and the dosage, frequency, and timing of application were based on normal agricultural practices in the potato crop. Applications of prosulfocarb, metribuzin (both herbicides), lambda-cyhalothrin (insecticide), chlorothalonil, and fluazinam (both fungicides) were made in the sequence typical of the spray calendar for potatoes. A total of 15 treatments with the various compounds were made <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> <b>application</b> to the water surface at 0. 2 %, 1 %, and 5 % of the recommended label rates. Chemical fate and effects on ecosystem function and structure (phytoplankton, zooplankton, chlorophyll-¿, macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, breakdown of plant litter) were investigated. To interpret the observed effects, treatment concentrations were also expressed in toxic units (TU), which describe the relative toxicity of the compounds with standard toxicity test organisms (Daphnia and algae). After treatment, each compound disappeared from the water phase within 2 d, with the exception of prosulfocarb, for which 50 % dissipation time (DT 50) values ranged between 6 and 7 d. At the 5 % treatment level, an exposure peak of 0. 9 TUalgae was observed, which resulted in short-term responses of pH, oxygen, and phytoplankton. At the 5 % treatment level, exposure concentrations also exceeded 0. 1 TUDaphnia, and this resulted in long-term effects on zooplankton and macroinvertebrates, some of which did not fully recover by the end of the present study. At the 1 % treatment level, only slight transient effects were observed on a limited number of zooplankton and macroinvertebrate species and on pH. At the 0. 2 % level, no consistent treatment-related effects were observed. Most of the observed effects were consistent with the results from higher-tier and mesocosm studies with the individual compounds. Multi and repeated stress played a small role within the applied pesticide package, because of rapid dissipation of most substances and the absence of many simultaneous applications. This suggests that risk assessments based on the individual compounds would in this case have been sufficiently protective for their uses in a crop protection progra...|$|E

Moreover, many unsteady phenomena associated with fluid-dynamic unsteadiness, such as impulsive starting or stopping of a burning droplet, or flow acceleration/deceleration effects, have not been investigated despite their importance in practical applications. In this study we investigate the effects of slow convection on droplet burning dynamics both experimentally and theoretically. The experimental portion of the study involves both ground-based experiments in the drop towers and future flight experiments on board the International Space Station. Heptane and methanol are used as test fuels, and this choice complements the quiescent-environment studies of the Droplet Combustion Experiment (DCE). An analytical model that employs the method of matched asymptotic expansions and uses the ratio of the convective velocity far from the droplet to the Stefan velocity at its surface as the small parameter for expansion has also been developed as a part of this investigation. Results from the ground-based experiments and comparison with the analytical model are presented in this report...|$|R
40|$|Crosslinked {{polydimethylsiloxane}} (PDMS) composite coatings containing luminescent micrometer-sized yellow Y 3 Al 5 O 12 :Ce 3 + (YAG:Ce 3 +) particles {{were prepared}} <b>by</b> <b>spraying</b> for potential <b>applications</b> in solid-state lighting. Blue light was down converted by phosphor particles to produce white light, yet poor color properties of YAG:Ce 3 + {{stemmed from a}} deficiency of red. When nitride-based red phosphor was simply blended into the system, the electrostatic interaction of negatively charged YAG:Ce 3 + and positively charged red phosphor particles caused remarkable clustering and heterogeneity in particle dispersion. Consequently, the light is dominantly blue and shifted to cold white. In other case, phosphor particles were sprayed onto the diffused polycarbonate substrate in stacked layers. Coatings with > 80 % inorganic content by mass with a thickness of 60 μm were subjected to thermal crosslinking, which {{the presence of the}} phosphor particles obstructed, presumably due to the hindrance of large phosphor particles in the diffusion of PDMS precursors. The coating of YAG:Ce 3 + first followed by red phosphor in stacked layers produced better light output and color properties than the coating obtained <b>by</b> <b>spraying</b> the mixture at once. Monte Carlo simulation validated the hypothesis. Turkish Academy of Sciences [TUBA-GEBIP]; Scientific and Technological Council of Turkey, TEYDEB (1501 3150192...|$|R
40|$|Data were {{collected}} from 13 farmers' detailed daily farm-records in Brebes Regency, Central Java, in November 2010 -August 2011. Based on brand names of pesticides recorded by farmers, active ingredient (AI) and mode of action (MoA) group according to IRAC (Insecticide Resistance Action Committee) and FRAC (Fungicide Resistance Action Committee) were identified. Results showed that {{the average number of}} <b>spray</b> <b>applications</b> during the presence of shallot in the intercropping system was 12 times season- 1 with 599 L ha- 1 of spray volume, while for hot pepper (after shallot was harvested) was 24 times/season with 632 L ha- 1 of spray volume. The use of pesticide cocktails in a tank-mix was quite common for farmers. In shallot, farmers applied insecticides from MoA group- 1 B in 91 % of all <b>spray</b> <b>applications.</b> Insecticides from group 13 were present in 60 % of all <b>spray</b> <b>applications,</b> while fungicides from MoA group-M 3 were used by all farmers in 96 % of <b>spray</b> <b>applications.</b> In hot pepper, all farmers used fungicides from MoA group- 6 and these were present in 54 % of <b>spray</b> <b>applications.</b> Almost all farmers used fungicides from MoA group- 4 A, and these were present in 53 % of <b>spray</b> <b>applications.</b> Many cocktails contained broad-spectrum insecticides (e. g., MoA groups 1 Borganophosphates and 3 A-pyrethroids) to which two to three more specific insecticides were also added. Due to pesticide misuse, it is most likely that pest and disease resistance is present on a large scale in the region. Furthermore, excessive use of pesticides caused <b>by</b> frequent <b>spraying,</b> use of pesticide cocktails with similar spectrum of action, and high water volumes, has also resulted in high production costs. Improvements in farmers' crop protection strategies in shallot and hot pepper cultivation are urgently required. </p...|$|R
50|$|In {{the past}} and recently, trunk {{injection}} of pesticides and plant resistance activators has been investigated in agriculture for control of pathogens and insect pests on fruit tree crops and grapevines. The most investigated are diseases and pests of avocado, apple, and grapevine, such as Phytophthora root rot of avocado Phytophthora cinnamomi and avocado thrips Scirtothrips perseae, fire blight Erwinia amylovora and apple scab Venturia inaequalis, oblique banded leaf roller Choristoneura rosaceana and codling moth Cydia pomonella, and grapevine downy mildew Plasmopara viticola and powdery mildew Uncinula necator. Apple trees are especially interesting as a research model in agriculture since {{it is known that}} apple production requires intensive spray schedules for control of pathogenic fungus V. inaequalis with as many as 15-22 sprays of fungicides per season in humid climate. Hence, trunk injection of pesticides is considered as an option for precise compound delivery which will reduce the negative impact of drift-driven pesticide losses in the environment, that occur after each spraying. Besides negative consequences of frequent pesticide applications in the environment, stem injection of grapevines is investigated in viticulture for control of pathogens with difficult biologies which infect and destroy woody tissues and that cannot be controlled efficiently <b>by</b> canopy <b>spray</b> <b>applications</b> of fungicides. To increase the efficiency of injected compounds in trees and vines, important considerations are plant anatomy, weather and soil conditions, tree physiology processes, spatial and temporal distribution of injected compound, and the chemical properties of injected compound and formulation.|$|R
40|$|Coatings {{containing}} up to 66 vol. % {{of silicon}} carbide were deposited <b>by</b> plasma <b>spray.</b> Potential <b>applications</b> {{can be found}} in the protection of CMC (ceramic matrix composite) against wear and high temperature oxidation. It is well known that SiC cannot be deposited <b>by</b> thermal <b>spray</b> because it decomposes before melting. To face this problem, a mixture of SiC and ZrB 2 was deposited, since those two compounds form a eutectic phase, at a temperature lower than the one of SiC decomposition. Coating microstructure was characterized by XRD, SEM, and EDS, confirming the presence of SiC in the deposited layer and the formation of the eutectic phase during spraying. Samples of the coatings were exposed in air at high temperature, in the range of 650 degrees C to 1700 degrees C. The oxide scale was investigated by means of XRD, SEM, EDS and WDS. It was constituted by a SiO 2 layer, which includes islands of ZrO 2. Test results showed the good potential of the material investigated to be used as a protection against the high temperature oxidation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
