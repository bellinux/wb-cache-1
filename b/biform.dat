40|$|Abstract. An axiomatic theory {{represents}} mathematical knowledge declaratively {{as a set}} of axioms. An algorithmic theory represents mathematical knowledge procedurally {{as a set of}} algorithms. A <b>biform</b> {{theory is}} simultaneously an axiomatic theory and an algorithmic theory.

Since the algorithms of algorithmic theories manipulate the syntax of expressions, <b>biform</b> theories—as well as algorithmic theories—are difficult to formalize in a traditional logic without the means to reason about syntax. Chiron is a derivative of von-Neumann-Bernays-Gödel (nbg) set theory that is intended to be a practical, general-purpose logic for mechanizing mathematics. It includes elements of type theory, a scheme for handling undefinedness, and a facility for reasoning about the syntax of expressions. It is an exceptionally well-suited logic for formalizing <b>biform</b> theories.

Though not all norms come from d^th roots of polynomials, we prove that any norm can be approximated arbitrarily well by a polynomial norm. We then investigate the computational problem of testing whether a form gives a polynomial norm. We show that this problem is strongly NP-hard already when the degree of the form is 4, but can always be answered by testing feasibility of a semidefinite program (of possibly large size). We further study the problem of optimizing over the set of polynomial norms using semidefinite programming.

For instance, consider a distribution system {{similar to the}} observed behavior of independent car dealerships.

Such behavior raises questions about competitive procurement strategies that achieve system optimal outcomes. This dissertation consists of three main bodies of work contained respectively in chapters 2, 3, and 4.

In the second work [...] chapter 3, we introduce a multilevel graph framework that links decentralized inventory distribution models as a network of stochastic programming with recourse problems. This framework depicts independent retailers who maximize their individual expected profits, with each retailer independently procuring inventory in the ex-ante stage in response to forecasted demand and anticipated cooperative recourse action of all retailers in the system. The graph framework clarifies the modeling connection between problems in a taxonomy of decentralized inventory distribution models.

Then a text was given to study without the map, and a comprehension test followed. Three texts were studied. The results indicated no comprehension differences between the two bi-form groups and neither between the two uniform groups. The comprehension scores were higher for the bi-form compared with the uniform interface. The no frame interface received the lowest scores.

In this paper, we study whether a collective EPR implementation, which is common in practice due to its cost efficiency advantage, can achieve this goal. In particular, we look for cost allocation mechanisms in a collective system that provide at least as effective design incentives as those induced by an individual system benchmark, while ensuring voluntary participation of producers (i. e. satisfying group incentive compatibility). Based on a <b>biform</b> network game model, we show that a cost allocation mechanism that satisfies the above criteria exists only if the recycling infrastructure satisfies certain properties in terms of (i) how recycling costs change {{as a function of}} design choices and (ii) the processing capacity mix relative to the return volume. Otherwise, a cost allocation mechanism that leads to effective design incentives can only guarantee individual rationality but not group incentive compatibility. This indicates a critical tradeoff between producers' design incentives and their voluntary participation in a collective system. That is, participation by enforcement may be required for a policy maker to induce superior designs and maintain a stable collective implementation (and therefore realize its cost efficiency advantage). If this is not feasible, then one needs to accept collective implementations as enablers of cost-efficiency at the expense of inferior design incentives, and find other means (i. e., other forms of regulatory intervention) besides cost allocation to provide design incentives...|$|E
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} (3 D) sensing, {{analysis and}} reconstruction {{of objects and}} scenesin unknown environments has become an important area of research in several disciplines. Recently, Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras have attracted attention because oftheir advantageous ability to generate full 3 D range distance information at videoframe rates. However, several challenging fluctuations like systematic or random errorscan occur and thus decrease {{the quality of the}} acquired data. Therefore, the usabilityof such systems is very much dependent on an accurate camera calibration. Inaddition, ToF cameras have still limited resolution (e. g. 176 x 144) and they can onlyprovide monochromatic (grayscale) information. This work concentrates on the fusion of 2 D vision and 3 D range data in order toobtain accurate and visually appealing representations of real indoor environments. Inparticular two major fields of research are treated. The first concerns the compensationof the common errors that the ToF cameras present. This is achieved by performing acalibration schema that additionally sets the ground towards the creation of a commonreference frame for both sensors. The second task is to incorporate these two differentsensors into one system that exhibits improved accuracy and high quality output data. The calibration process addresses both photogrammetric and depth correction techniques. Moreover, {{due to the fact that}} the real world scenes increase the level of difficultythat such a system has to confront, a validation of the ToF cameras performanceemerges as an important need. For this purpose, a novel approach to evaluate and get abetter insight on the accuracy of the ToF camera is introduced, based on a 3 D NormalDistribution Transform. Finally, as sensor fusion plays an important role in this work, multi-sensor applicationsare further investigated based on the incorporation of such a <b>biform</b> sensorysystem. Principle goal is to communicate the color information and enhance the overallresult by the use of 3 D surface reconstruction approaches. ...|$|E
