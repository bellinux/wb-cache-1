5|$|There are {{two methods}} of {{construction}} {{used for the}} water channels. Clay channels date from the Middle Preclassic while stone-lined channels date from the Late Preclassic through to the Classic, with stone-lined channels from the Late Classic being the largest channels built at the site. It is presumed that the clay channels were not sufficiently effective, thus leading to the switch in construction materials and the implementation of stone-lined channels. In the Late Classic pieces of <b>broken</b> <b>stone</b> monuments were reused {{in the construction of}} the water channels.|$|E

At Auschwitz the Oświęcim State Museum currently houses exhibitions on Nazi crimes with a special section (Block Number 27) specifically focused on Jewish victims and martyrs. At Treblinka there is a monument built out of many shards of <b>broken</b> <b>stone,</b> {{as well as a}} mausoluem dedicated to those who perished there. A small mound of human ashes commemorates the 350,000 victims of the Majdanek camp who were killed there by the Nazis. In Łódz there is the largest Jewish burial ground in Europe, and preserved historic sites include those located in Góra Kalwaria and Leżajsk.|$|E

25|$|On March 11, 1982, {{the revised}} design was {{formally}} approved, and on March 26, 1982, ground was formally <b>broken.</b> <b>Stone</b> {{for the wall}} came from Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It was chosen because of its reflective quality and also because of opposition to Swedish and Canadian stone, as those countries were destinations for draft evaders. Stone cutting and fabrication was done in Barre, Vermont. The typesetting of the original 58,195 names on the wall was performed by Datalantic in Atlanta, Georgia. Stones were then shipped to Memphis, Tennessee where the names were etched. The etching was completed using a photoemulsion and sandblasting process. The negatives used in the process are in storage at the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
25|$|A new dock {{system was}} also {{proposed}} {{of which the}} main feature was a wide river street encircling the waterfront to afford ample accommodation for the movement of freight and its transportation by rail. The new river and sea wall was to be constructed of granite and a Beton concrete, composed of Portland cement and <b>broken</b> <b>stone.</b> From this wall projecting into the river were a series of piers constructed of wood, iron, and stone. The large concrete blocks used {{in the construction of}} the new river wall were manufactured at the yards of the Dock Commission in Gansevoort Street, Manhattan. Two to three blocks, of forty to fifty tons each, were made daily. Westervelt was closely involved in these improvements.|$|E
25|$|Many {{difficulties}} {{occurred in}} driving the piles which considerably retarded {{the progress of}} the work, and, among others, the peculiar effect of ebb and flow during this operation is worthy of note. At flood-tide the sand became so hard as almost totally to resist the utmost efforts of driving, while at ebb the sand was quite loose, and allowed of doing so with facility. It was therefore found necessary to abandon the driving on many occasions during high water. The difference between high and low water is 11 feet 6 inches. Another difficulty arose from the quicksands beneath the foundations. Although the piles were driven to the rock bottom, the water forced its way up, baffling the attempts to fill in between them; this, however, was remedied by using a concrete made of <b>broken</b> <b>stone</b> and Roman cement, which was continually thrown in until the bottom was found to be secure.|$|E

500|$|The Mosque of al-Khidr (also called [...] "Maqam al-Khader") is [...] by [...] and {{was built}} on the site of a Byzantine monastery. The {{northern}} and southern walls were buttressed and the eastern wall has three apses. The Survey of Western Palestine related in 1875 that there were Greek inscriptions on one of the steps leading to the door at the southern wall while on the floor was a <b>broken</b> <b>stone</b> slab marked by two Maltese crosses, apparently resembling a tombstone. Further slabs and Greek inscriptions were found {{in the eastern part of}} the mosque and in the courtyard. In the center is a tomb made of modern masonry that tradition claims is the tomb of Saint George ("Mar Jirjis") or al-Khidr, as he is known in Arabic.|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} the {{permanent}} way was a departure from that of London's previous tube railways, which used track laid on timber baulks across the tunnel with {{the bottom of the}} tube left open. This approach caused what the BS's management regarded as an unacceptable level of vibrations. They resolved this by mounting the sleepers on supports made of sand and cement grout, with the sleeper ends resting on comparatively soft <b>broken</b> <b>stone</b> ballast underneath the running rails. A drain ran parallel with the rails underneath the middle of the track. The rails themselves were unusually short– only [...] long– as this was the maximum length that could be brought in through the shafts and then turned horizontally to be carried into the tunnels. Power was supplied through third (positive) and fourth (negative) rails laid in the middle and outside of the track, as used on the District Railway.|$|E
2500|$|Only {{two years}} after opening for worship, dry rot was already {{spreading}} rapidly throughout {{the interior of the}} church. The architect recommended that the space under the seats be filled with gravel and <b>broken</b> <b>stone</b> as well as paving the whole of the ground floor. [...] This was carried out in 1824 except in the middle section of the church which was not infected. Further expensive schemes of interior improvement were carried out in 1895 and 1923 with little success since they left the existing interior largely unaltered. The church was noted as [...] "lacking few pretensions to beauty".|$|E

2500|$|Applying gravel, or [...] "metalling," [...] {{has had two}} {{distinct}} usages in road surfacing. The term road metal refers to the <b>broken</b> <b>stone</b> or cinders used in the construction or repair of roads or railways, and {{is derived from the}} Latin metallum, which means both [...] "mine" [...] and [...] "quarry". [...] The term originally referred to the process of creating a gravel roadway. [...] The route of the roadway would first be dug down several feet and, depending on local conditions, French drains {{may or may not have}} been added. [...] Next, large stones were placed and compacted, followed by successive layers of smaller stones, until the road surface was composed of small stones compacted into a hard, durable surface. [...] "Road metal" [...] later became the name of stone chippings mixed with tar to form the road surfacing material tarmac. [...] A road of such material is called a [...] "metalled road" [...] in Britain, a [...] "paved road" [...] in Canada and the US, or a [...] "sealed road" [...] in parts of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20thcentury, roads in Iowa were suited for horse and buggy and ill-suited for automobiles. [...] As more Iowans {{purchased}} automobiles, the Iowa legislature set up in 1904 a commission at Iowa State College in Ames to handle issues that arose concerning travel and safety. [...] In 1904, less than 2 percent, or just over [...] of public roads in Iowa had been improved with gravel or <b>broken</b> <b>stone.</b> [...] The first task of the Iowa State Highway Commission, now the Iowa Department of Transportation, was to study Iowa's problematic roads. [...] At the time, roads were merely dusty dirt trails when dry, and quagmires of mud when wet. [...] By 1906, every county was maintaining its dirt road with drags. [...] Designed by Missourian E. Ward King, road drags were a cost-effective way to smooth out dirt roads, costing as much as $3.00 ($, adjusted for inflation) to build. [...] In 1913, the Commission separated from Iowa State College and gained control over county and local transportation officials, who were responsible for road construction and maintenance. [...] The Iowa Highway Commission did not gain jurisdiction over public roads until 1924.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe found {{extensive}} {{evidence that}} the vertical ground accelerations produced during the largest shock (M = 6. 0) of the 1997 Umbria-Marche earthquake sequence exceeded 1 g in two areas close to the heavily-damaged villages of Annifo and Colle Croce. This evidence comes from the striking observation of thousands of freshly fractured and <b>broken</b> rocks and <b>stones</b> in these areas. Some of the <b>broken</b> <b>stones</b> lie isolated on soft detritic soil while others had been previously piled up, probably a long time agoto clear the fields for farming. The freshness of the cuts and fractures and {{the consistency of the}} observations for thousands of rocks and stones in these areas indicate that these rocks were thrown upwards during the earthquake, with breakage occurring at the time of impact. Ground motion calculations consistent with the static deformation inferred from GPS and interferometry data, show that the <b>broken</b> <b>stones</b> and rocks are found in the zone where the strongest shaking took place during the earthquake and that most of the shaking there was vertical...|$|R
