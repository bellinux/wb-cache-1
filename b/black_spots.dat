50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 9-10 mm. The forewings {{are covered}} with light grey, brown-tipped scales. There is a large <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> at one-third and a small <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> at two-thirds length of the costal margin. There is also a diffused <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> at the base near the posterior margin {{and there are two}} small black dots {{at the base of the}} cell and large <b>black</b> <b>spot,</b> sometimes separated into two small dots, at corner of the cell.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{its highly}} {{variable}} color pattern, the leopard catshark {{has historically been}} known under a multitude of names. In an 1837 issue of Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, Scottish physician and zoologist Andrew Smith listed without descriptions the new genus Poroderma, containing the species P.africanum (the pyjama shark), P.pantherinum, P.submaculatum, and P.variegatum. German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle assigned these sharks to the genus Scyllium, and in their 18381841 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen furnished descriptions for S.pantherinum and S.variegatum, and listed two more names without description, S.leopardinum and S.maeandrinum. In 1934, American zoologist Henry Weed Fowler described P.marleyi, characterized by large <b>black</b> <b>spots.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} level of {{nutrient}} requirements, cabbage is prone to nutrient deficiencies, including boron, calcium, phosphorus and potassium. There are several physiological disorders that can affect the postharvest appearance of cabbage. Internal tip burn occurs when the margins of inside leaves turn brown, but the outer leaves look normal. Necrotic spot is where there are oval sunken spots a few millimeters across that are often grouped around the midrib. In pepper spot, tiny <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> occur on the areas between the veins, which can increase during storage.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{distress}} signal, the TARDIS lands {{aboard a}} 17th-century pirate ship {{stranded in the}} middle of an ocean. The ship's crew have been terrorised by a Siren-like creature (Lily Cole) who marks people with <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> on their palms after they are injured. Her song then lulls victims into a trance, making them want to go to her, which apparently disintegrates them. Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) receives a cut during a tussle with the pirates, and finds a black spot on his hand, but is prevented from succumbing to the song of the Siren by Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and the Doctor (Matt Smith).|$|E

5|$|In January 1934 the Black Hawks {{were on a}} train back to Chicago when Gardiner felt {{an intense}} pain in his throat that spread {{to the rest of}} his body, notably his kidneys. When {{questioned}} by Tommy Gorman about his issue, Gardiner lied to Gorman and insisted it was only a minor headache. However, when Gardiner woke up on the train in the morning, he had trouble seeing, as <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> obscured his vision. This was Gardiner's first uremic convulsion.|$|E
5|$|The Danube crested newt's {{back and}} sides are dark brown with <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> and white stippling. The belly is orange to red (in other crested newts, {{it is usually}} yellow or orange–yellow), with small or {{medium-sized}} black blotches that have sharp edges. Like all crested newts, T.dobrogicus males develop a crest on their back and tail during breeding phase, which can be quite high and jagged and usually starts between the eyes and nostrils. Another feature of males at breeding season is a bluish-white stripe along the tail.|$|E
5|$|The P. rebeli {{are noted}} for their large blue wings, with the males {{displaying}} a violet blue shade and the females displaying blue basal areas interspersed with brown spots, {{similar to other}} butterflies in its genus. The undersides of the butterfly are a dark brown with small <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> that are circled in white. It can be distinguished from its close relative, the P. alcon, by the broader black margins of the upperside male and the extensive blue basal areas in the females. It has a wingspan of approximately 32–36mm.|$|E

5|$|At {{first the}} moth {{was thought to}} be from China or Bengal, but was later found to be endemic to Madagascar. It is found {{throughout}} the year {{in most parts of the}} island, with peak populations between March and August, and smallest numbers between October and December. Females lay about 80 eggs under the leaves of Omphalea spp. The caterpillars are whitish-yellow with <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> and red feet and are covered in club-ended black setae. Silk spun from the mouth helps the caterpillars hold on to smooth leaves and climb back to the plant when they fall. After completing four instars, the caterpillars spin an open network cocoon. The pupal stage lasts from 17 to 23 days.|$|E
5|$|Crested newts {{are dark}} brown, with <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> on the sides, and white {{stippling}} in some species. Their belly is yellow to orange with black blotches, forming a pattern characteristic for individuals. Females and juveniles of some species have a yellow line running down their back and tail. During breeding phase, crested newts change in appearance, most markedly the males. These develop a skin seam running along their back and tail; this crest is the namesake {{feature of the}} crested newts and can be up to 1.5cm high and very jagged in the northern crested newt. Another feature of males at breeding time is a silvery-white band {{along the sides of}} the tail.|$|E
5|$|Most of the fins {{are fairly}} narrow; in adults the {{pectoral}} fins are broad and roughly triangular. The moderately tall first dorsal fin is placed about {{halfway between the}} pectoral and pelvic fins, and its trailing margin is nearly vertical near the apex. The second dorsal fin is about three-quarters {{as high as the}} first and larger than the anal fin. The caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe; in young sharks the lower caudal fin lobe is much less distinct. This species is gray above, with darker saddles and scattered <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> that fade with age; the underside is off-white.|$|E
5000|$|Adults are pale yellow, the {{forewings}} {{with the}} apical {{half of the}} costal line brown. There is a moderately large <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> close to the costa beyond the middle and another slightly larger spot below it in the disc. The hindwings have an even larger <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> at the apex, and a lunular <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> in the disc, with its lower end near the outer margin. The outer marginal line is black.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 7 mm. The forewings {{are covered with}} light grey, black-tipped scales concentrated mainly along the costal margin. There is a <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> at two-thirds near the dorsal margin and a small <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> {{at the base of}} the cell and a prolonged <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> at the corner of the cell. There are ochreous scales along veins, mainly in the basal half. The hindwings are grey. Adults are on wing in early June.|$|R
50|$|Female: Differs {{from the}} male as follows: Upperside: All the {{markings}} {{larger and more}} conspicuous; an additional large <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> {{in the middle of}} interspace 1. Underside: Similar to that of the male, but with the additional <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> as noted above.|$|R
5|$|Samantha {{takes the}} {{children}} to the park, where another child tells Lisa and Tabitha that they cannot be sisters because they have different skin colors. When they arrive home, Tabitha casts a spell on herself and Lisa so that Tabitha's skin has <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> and Lisa's skin has white spots. Lisa thereby discovers that Tabitha and Samantha are witches. When Samantha finds the two girls polka-dotted, she tells Tabitha to reverse the spell, which Tabitha unsuccessfully tries to do. Eventually, Samantha realizes that Tabitha's attempt was unsuccessful because Tabitha subconsciously wants the spots to remain so she and Lisa {{will continue to be}} sisters. Samantha tells the girls that differences in appearance won't prevent them from being sisters, and Tabitha then successfully reverses the spell just as Lisa's parents arrive to pick up Lisa.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{finds the}} spaceship's crew long dead from {{exposure}} to a human virus. The trio then discover a sickbay where Avery's entire crew, Toby, and Rory are in medical care along with the TARDIS. The Siren {{turns out to be}} the ship's virtual doctor, caring for the injured humans; the <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> are tissue samples used as references. Amy convinces the Siren to release Rory into her care. Using Rory's nursing knowledge, Amy and the Doctor remove him from life support and are able to resuscitate him. Meanwhile, Avery decides to stay with his son and his crew, unable to go back to England himself while the ship will care for his crew. Avery takes the helm of the spaceship and, along with Toby and his crew, sets off to explore the stars.|$|E
5|$|The base {{color of}} the living animal is very pale subtranslucent yellow. The mantle, kidney, and {{hepatopancreas}} are visible through the shell but are often slightly obscured by {{the thickness of the}} shell. The dorsal surface of the mantle is pale yellow, tinted with olive, often marked with black streaks and blotches. Over the hepatopancreas is a golden yellow tessellation that is marked with gray or <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> and streaks. A dark marking on the posterior surface of the foot is distinctive. However, the mark is not present on the hatchlings, making them impossible to identify in the field. The mark becomes obvious once the snail reaches approximately 6 to 9mm in length.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 17 mm. The {{wings are}} light greyish brown, the forewings with a broad, diffuse, dark brown postmedial shade, partly edged by wavy whitish lines. There is a <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> {{at the base}} and a subterminal <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> at vein 7.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 26-38 mm. The forewings are semitransparent, pale {{gray with}} dark veins. There is a diffuse <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> {{near the center}} of the wing. The hindwings are paler and without a <b>black</b> <b>spot.</b> Adults are on wing year-round in Costa Rica.|$|R
40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>spot</b> {{caused by}} the fungus Diplocarpon rosea Wolf. is the most {{widespread}} disease in ornamental roses. Frequent applications of environmentally non-benign chemical fungicides are necessary to effectively prevent and control this disease. Ecological and environmental concerns about frequent fungicide applications are growing, and public demand for safer alternatives to fungicides is increasing. This study evaluated water extracts and essential oils from holy basil (Ocimum gratissimum L.), sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), English thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.), and ‘Scotch’ spearmint (Mentha x gracilis Sole) for suppression and control of <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> disease in roses as compared with a commonly used fungicide. The results revealed that weekly treatments with essential oils of ‘Scotch’ spearmint and English thyme produced significantly lower <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> rating as compared with a water control, and the fungicide treatment had lower <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> rating than all treatments, except the ‘Scotch’ spearmint essential oil and the English thyme essential oil. Our results demonstrate that essential oils of English thyme and ‘Scotch’ spearmint hold promise as biopesticides for control of <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> on roses {{as an alternative to}} chemical fungicides. The use of essential oils for suppression or control of <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> on roses would benefit environmental health, and minimize human exposure to pesticides in general...|$|R
5|$|The {{sycamore}} is {{susceptible to}} sooty bark disease, caused by the fungus Cryptostroma corticale. This causes wilting of the crown {{and the death of}} branches. Rectangular patches of bark become detached exposing thick layers of black fungal spores. The fungus may be present in the heartwood without symptoms for many years, working its way towards the bark following long, hot summers. The spores are hyper-allergenic and cause a condition called maple bark stripper’s disease, a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Less serious is the fungus Rhytisma acerinum which often forms the disease known as tar spot, in which <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> with yellow margins form on the foliage. The leaves may fall prematurely but the vigour of the tree is little affected. Sycamore leaf spot, caused by the fungus Cristulariella depraedans, results in pale blotches on leaves which later dry up and fall. This disease can cause moderate leaf loss but trees are little affected in the long run.|$|E
5|$|After they hatch, {{the small}} {{caterpillars}} only eat the tissue (parenchyma) between the veins of the leaves. They {{do this to}} avoid the sticky and toxic latex produced by the plant's laticifers and transported in the veins. After 3–4 days, the caterpillars also eat flowers, fruit, tendrils, petioles and young stems (as well as continuing to eat leaves), defoliating the entire plant. They are particularly fond of the glands {{at the base of}} the leaf, near the petiole. They can deal with the chemical defences in the latex, which does not cause the problem of mouthpart coagulation. The caterpillars spin silk from their mouth with an '∞' motion of the head as they walk, this keeps them from falling from the smooth surface of the leaves. The silk also permits them to climb back to the plant should they fall. Strong rain makes them fall despite the silk. There are four instars, and the caterpillar stage lasts from two months in the warm season to two and a half to three months in the cold season. The caterpillar is whitish-yellow with <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> and red feet and is covered in club-ended black setae. It has five pairs of prolegs on segments 3 to 6 and 10, and six true legs attached to the thorax.|$|E
5|$|This {{species has}} a {{courtship}} flight conducted above the trees. The pair fly on a strongly oscillating path with one bird ascending {{while the other}} is descending, both calling constantly. After display, the birds land on a branch for a mating ritual which starts with locking bills, followed by the female hanging upside-down for a variable period of time, and then copulation while the male holds the female's neck. The flight and mating rituals have been recorded for three-coloured and red-throated parrotfinches, and may be typical for the genus. The nest is built with fresh grass blades, and is domed with a side entrance. It is always hidden in thick foliage, but can be at any height from the ground. The normal clutch is four spherical whitish eggs. Chicks are naked and have pinkish skin; the distinctive gape has blue nodular spots technically termed as papillae or tubercles at {{the upper and lower}} corners, and the yellow palate has a ring of five <b>black</b> <b>spots.</b> Most young estrildid finches beg for food with their wings held against the side, but juvenile parrotfinches lift the wing on the side away from the feeding parent. This behaviour may restrict competition for food from other nestlings.|$|E
