50|$|All {{banks are}} {{required}} to hold {{a certain percentage of}} their assets as capital, a rate which may be established by the central bank or the <b>banking</b> <b>supervisor.</b> For international banks, including the 55 member central banks of the Bank for International Settlements, the threshold is 8% (see the Basel Capital Accords) of risk-adjusted assets, whereby certain assets (such as government bonds) are considered to have lower risk and are either partially or fully excluded from total assets for the purposes of calculating capital adequacy. Partly due to concerns about asset inflation and repurchase agreements, capital requirements may be considered more effective than reserve requirements in preventing indefinite lending: when at the threshold, a bank cannot extend another loan without acquiring further capital on its balance sheet.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} direct and joint effects of bank governance, regulation, and {{supervision}} {{on the quality of}} risk reporting in the banking industry, as proxied for by operational risk disclosure (ORD) quality in European banks. After controlling for the endogeneity between bank stability and risk reporting quality, we find that banks having a higher proportion of outside board directors, lower executive ownership, concentrated outside non-governmental ownership, and more active audit committee, and operating under regulations promoting bank competition (i. e., less stringent entry to banking requirements) provide ORD of higher quality. In addition, we find that the contribution of <b>bank</b> <b>supervisors</b> to the enhancement of ORD quality depends on the ownership structure of the bank. Specifically, powerful and independent <b>bank</b> <b>supervisors</b> mitigate the incentives for entrenched bank executives to withhold voluntary ORD. Moreover, <b>bank</b> <b>supervisors</b> and largest shareholders perform substitutive roles in monitoring the bank management's compliance with mandatory ORD requirements. For the sake of enhancing risk reporting quality in banks, our findings recommend sustaining board independence, enhancing audit committee activity, easing entry to banking requirements, and promoting a more proactive role for <b>bank</b> <b>supervisors...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I explore {{the topic of}} {{corporate}} governance applied to the banking industry and within it, {{the role of the}} <b>Banking</b> <b>Supervisor.</b> The topic of corporate governance has been gaining popularity since the 1990 s as a necessary objective for all listed companies. Furthermore, this topic has been of great prominence and public interest {{because of the lack of}} sound corporate governance practices in some major companies across the world have showed- most of these corporate scandals of recent years have been linked to corporate governance practices. Most of the documentation which exists on the topic of corporate governance and supervision is theoretical. The goal of this research is to bring practical insight to a recent issue in the most regulated industry, after meeting with professionals in that domain. The banking industry is facing quite a dilemma: on one hand it is an ever growing business competing for more clients, more shareholders and market domination, but on the other hand it has found itself needing to comply to stricter corporate governance regulations, which can be seen as limiting its short-term competitiveness but ironically, ensure its long-term survival. Good corporate governance practices also guarantee a stronger financial system hence economic stability. The Banking Supervisor's role is essential to promote sound practice of corporate governance, by making sure that banks' structure is appropriate and adequate to permit the application of national banking standards at the institutional level and new international requirements such as the Basel II Capital Accord. Although the <b>Banking</b> <b>Supervisor</b> can be seen most visibly in its enforcement and disciplinary role, it has to have many more additional qualities: that of monitor, adviser, communication link and ultimately the guardian and protector of the financial markets...|$|E

Failure to identify deterioration in credit quality in a timely manner can aggravate and prolong the problem. Two key issues arise with regard to the use of collateral in the context of loan classification and provisioning. In particular, the questions arise whether collateral should be taken into account in classifying a collateralized loan, and whether it should be considered in calculating provisions.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the issue of the {{relevance}} of financial instruments’ disclosure in the banking sector, considered as a topic of crucial importance especially after the recent financial crisis. Namely, this paper aims to test whether information required by IFRS 7 is value relevant for investors in order to support them in assigning appropriate risk levels in their investment decisions. The regulatory framework of bank’ financial risks is complex since it is formulated by a range of different bodies, including the Basel Committee, the IASB, the National <b>Banking</b> <b>Supervisor</b> and local accounting standards. Literature, however, argues for the incompleteness of such framework. This incompleteness is one of the premises for IFRS 7. The sample consists of the annual reports of all Italian listed banks over a 7 -year period, 2007 – 2013. To provide some first results, we have used an OLS model. We expect to provide valuable evidence that banks complying with IFRS 7 are rewarded with higher evaluation by the market. Results confirm our expectations, showing a positive association between banks’ value and the financial index disclosure.

The current supervisory framework {{is the result of}} recent reforms adopted in response to the global financial crisis.
