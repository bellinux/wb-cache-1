The results of this project have significantly contributed to the body of knowledge surrounding EV biology especially with regard to keratinocyte-derived EVs and EV mediated keratinocyte – fibroblast interaction. This information will have utility for future research directions in wound and skin biology...|$|R
40|$|Cancer cells emit a {{heterogeneous}} mixture of vesicular, organelle-like structures (microvesicles, MVs) into their surroundings including blood and body fluids. MVs are generated via diverse biological mechanisms triggered by pathways involved in oncogenic transformation, microenvironmental stimulation, cellular activation, stress, or death. Vesiculation events occur {{either at the}} plasma membrane (ectosomes, shed vesicles) or within endosomal structures (exosomes). MVs are increasingly recognized as mediators of intercellular communication due to their capacity to merge with and transfer a repertoire of <b>bioactive</b> <b>molecular</b> content (cargo) to recipient cells.

40|$|Editor's introduction. Linking {{food and}} natural {{ingredients}} to health impacts is, of course, not novel. For centuries, experiential knowledge distilled and passed on {{from one generation}} to the next has pointed to such linkages, often with success. Scientific discoveries, however, significantly improve on traditional experiential knowledge development. Structured scientific methods increase the rate of new knowledge accumulation and improve its accuracy. Furthermore, scientific discoveries focus on the <b>bioactive</b> <b>molecular</b> components of food rather than on whole foods. In this way, the content of important bioactive ingredients (or vitalins as Burn and Kishore propose) may be increased, decreased or stabilized for improved "functionality" and health impacts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Complex {{biological}} and ecological processes {{occur in the}} rhizosphere through ecosystem-level interactions between roots, microorganisms and soil fauna. Over the past decade, studies of the rhizosphere have revealed that when roots, microorganisms and soil fauna physically contact one another, <b>bioactive</b> <b>molecular</b> exchanges often mediate these interactions as intercellular signal, which prepare the partners for successful interactions. Despite the importance of bioactive molecules in sustainable agriculture, little is known of their numerous functions, and improving plant health and productivity by altering ecological processes remains difficult. In this review, we describe the major bioactive molecules present in below-ground ecosystems (i. e., flavonoids, exopolysaccharides, antibiotics and quorum-sensing signals), and we discuss how these molecules affect microbial communities, nutrient availability and plant defense responses...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{maintenance}} of bone homeostasis is largely dependent upon cellular communication between osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Microvesicles (MVs) {{have received a}} good deal of attention and are increasingly considered as mediators of intercellular communication due to their capacity to merge with and transfer a repertoire of <b>bioactive</b> <b>molecular</b> content (cargo) to recipient cells, triggering a variety of biologic responses. Here, we demonstrated that MVs shed from osteoblasts contain RANKL protein and can transfer it to osteoclast precursors through receptor ligand (RANKL–RANK), leading to stimulation of RANKL–RANK signaling to facilitate osteoclast formation. Such MV-mediated intercellular communication between osteoblasts and osteoclasts may represent a novel mechanism of bone modeling and remodeling. It may be worthwhile to further explore MVs as tools to modify the biological responses of bone cells or develop an alternative drug to treat bone diseases...|$|R
