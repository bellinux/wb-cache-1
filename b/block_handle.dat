The referee will enforce all rules and decisions of FINA and shall decide all questions {{relating to the}} actual conduct of the meet, and event or the competition, the final settlement of which is not otherwise covered by the rules. The referee takes overall responsibility for running the race and makes the final decisions as to who wins the competition. Referees call swimmers to the blocks with short blasts {{of his or her}} whistle. This is the signal for the swimmers to stand next to their blocks. Then the referee will blow a long whistle that will tell the swimmers to step on the block. For backstroke events, the long whistle is the signal for the swimmers to step in the water. The referee will then blow another long whistle, signalling the swimmers to grab the gutter or the provided <b>block</b> <b>handle.</b> The referee will then hand over the rest to the starter by directing his or her hand to the starter.|$|E

The first experiment showed that after the robot learned different types of ball handling behaviors using human direct teaching, the robot was able to generate adequate ball handling motor sequences situated to the relative position between the robot’s hands and the ball. The same scheme was applied to a <b>block</b> <b>handling</b> learning task where it was shown that the robot can switch among learned different <b>block</b> <b>handling</b> sequences, situated to the ways of interaction by human supporters.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to compare the effects of the task {{variables}} block mass, working height and one- vs. two-handed <b>block</b> <b>handling</b> on low back and shoulder loading during masonry work. In a mock-up of a masonry work site, nine masonry workers performed one- and two-handed block-lifting and block-placing tasks at varying heights (ranging from floor to shoulder level) with blocks of varying mass (ranging from 6 to 16 kg). Kinematics and ground reaction forces were measured and used in a 3 -D linked segment model to calculate low back and shoulder loading. Increasing lifting height appeared to be the most effective way to reduce low back loading. However, working at shoulder level resulted in relatively high shoulder loading. Therefore, it was recommended to organise masonry work in such a way that <b>blocks</b> are <b>handled</b> with the hands at about iliac crest height as much as possibl...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{quantify}} differences in swimming track start performances using side handle and front handle grip techniques and using an inclined platform at the rear of the starting platform. An instrumented starting block system was designed to allow front grip and side grip starting techniques and inclusion of a rear incline. Thirty male and 20 female junior elite swimmers completed three starts in each of four start block configurations: (1) Flat (traditional) <b>block,</b> front <b>handle</b> grip; (2) Flat (traditional) <b>block,</b> side <b>handle</b> grip; (3) Incline (new) <b>block,</b> front <b>handle</b> grip; (4) Incline (new) <b>block,</b> side <b>handle</b> grip. Force and video data were used to quantify parameters related to starting performance. Results indicated that use of side handles had a substantial impact on start performance while the effects of the rear incline were less pronounced. Compared to using a front grip technique, use of the side handles increased horizontal velocity at takeoff up to 18 %, resulted in a more horizontal takeoff angle by up to 2 °, increased contribution to horizontal impulse from arms up to 12 %, increased peak horizontal power up to 28 %, decreased time to 6 m by 4 % and increased velocity at 6 m by 2. 5 %. These advantages were achieved at a cost of an 8 % increase in propulsion time. Based on this study, w...|$|R

40|$|A {{system that}} can process sensory {{information}} collected during telemanipulation tasks in order to automatically identify properties of the remote environment has many potential applications. These include generating model-based simulations for training operators in critical procedures and improving real-time performance in unstructured environments or when time delays are large. The research issues involved in developing such an identification system are explored, focusing on properties that can be identified from remote manipulator motion and force data. As a case study, a simple blockstacking task, performed with a teleoperated two-fingered planar hand, is considered. An algorithm is presented which automatically segments the data collected during the task, given only a general description of the temporal sequence of task events. Using the segmented data, the algorithm then successfully estimates the weight, width, height, and coefficient of friction of the two <b>blocks</b> <b>handled</b> during the task.

40|$|Construction {{professionals}} {{have been using}} time-lapse movies in monitoring construction operations. However, some amount of detail is always lost in the interval between two consecutive frames in a time-lapse movie. This poses the question: By how much can the frame rate be lowered from the standard 30 fps (frames per second) {{to allow for the}} accurate observation of construction operations from a time-lapse movie? This paper addresses the problem by establishing the optimum frame rates for observation of activities related to mortar mixing and <b>block</b> <b>handling.</b> The activities were first recorded at the standard rate of 30 fps. Using the Adobe Premier Pro video editing software, the records were then segregated into still images from which 15 different time-lapse movies of various time intervals were generated. The movies were then shown to 25 Construction Managers. A structured questionnaire was employed to capture the level of accuracy with which Construction Managers could interpret the job site situation from each movie. The results suggest that 1 fpm (frame per minute) is sufficient for the accurate tracking of labourers involved in mortar mixing while 1 frame in every 20 seconds is sufficient for accurate identification of number of cement bags used. However, for tracking number of blocks off-loaded, and those damaged, 1 frame in every 2 seconds is required...|$|R

40|$|Background: The recent {{availability}} of an expanding collection of genome sequences driven bytechnological advances has facilitated comparative genomics {{and in particular}} the identification ofsynteny among multiple genomes. However, the development of effective and easy-to-use methodsfor identifying such conserved gene clusters among multiple genomes–synteny blocks–as well asdatabases, which host synteny blocks from various groups of species (especially eukaryotes) andalso allow users to run synteny-identification programs, lags behind. Descriptions: OrthoClusterDB is a new online platform for the identification and visualization ofsynteny blocks. OrthoClusterDB consists of two key web pages: Run OrthoCluster and View Synteny. The Run OrthoCluster page serves as web front-end to OrthoCluster, a recently developed programfor synteny block detection. Run OrthoCluster offers full control over the functionalities ofOrthoCluster, such as specifying synteny block size, considering order and strandedness of geneswithin synteny blocks, including or excluding nested synteny <b>blocks,</b> <b>handling</b> one-to-manyorthologous relationships, and comparing multiple genomes. In contrast, the View Synteny page givesaccess to perfect and imperfect synteny blocks precomputed for a large number of genomes,without the need for users to retrieve and format input data. Additionally, genes are cross-linkedwith public databases for effective browsing. For both Run OrthoCluster and View Synteny, identifiedsynteny blocks can be browsed at the whole genome, chromosome, and individual gene level. OrthoClusterDB is freely accessible. Conclusion: We have developed an online system for the identification and visualization ofsynteny blocks among multiple genomes. The system is freely available at [URL]...|$|R

Levering joined the team's radio broadcast in 2015 as a fill-in for Uecker on select road games and Grindle joined the team in 2016, replacing Joe Block, who had left to join the Pittsburgh Pirates after the 2015 season.
