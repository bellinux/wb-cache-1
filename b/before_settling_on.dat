To achieve the E-E open-string range of standard (Spanish) tuning, Patt started using seven-string guitars in 1963, <b>before</b> <b>settling</b> <b>on</b> eight-string guitars with high G (equivalently A) as their highest open-notes.

5|$|Before 1902, Manchester United {{were known}} as Newton Heath, during which time they first played their {{football}} matches at North Road and then Bank Street in Clayton. However, both grounds were blighted by wretched conditions, the pitches ranging from gravel to marsh, while Bank Street suffered from clouds of fumes from its neighbouring factories.
