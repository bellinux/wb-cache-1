5000|$|Two {{cars were}} contracted, {{one for the}} {{television}} program and the other as a promotional car, for touring car shows around the United States. Both cars would be built {{in the span of}} four weeks. The first version originally featured a 6-71 supercharged engine, a solid mounted rear axle (no springs) and extra rear end weight. This was to enable the car to [...] "pop wheelies." [...] Because the car had too much power and was difficult to drive, the original <b>blower</b> <b>set</b> up was removed and a dummy blower was fitted. The second car was used as a touring car for auto shows and promotional events. Before its transformation into the Monkeemobile, the second car was first seen on TV as Major Nelson's GTO in [...] "I Dream of Jeannie". Both were used on The Monkees TV series, one during the first season and both throughout the second season.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to develop a}} methodology for seed processing and X-ray analysis and to study imbibition pattern in seeds of candeia (Eremanthus incanus). Seeds were gathered in 2001 and 2002 in Morro do Pilar and Lavras respectively, processed and stored in a cold chamber (5 ºC/ 60 %RH) until the start of experiments. In order to identify unfilled seeds, a protocol was developed for X-ray use combining radiation energy (Kv) and exposure time (seconds). For elimination of unfilled seeds, an experiment was conducted using a South Dakota seed blower whereby different opening settings and ventilation times were combined. Original seed lots and categorized lots following radiograph viewing were tested by germination tests, with seeds being cleansed in sodium hypochlorite and scattered over blotting paper in ‘gerboxes’ and then taken to germinators with alternating temperatures of 20 º- 30 ºC and 10 hours of light, for up to 15 days. Imbibition curves were determined under the conditions 30 ºC, 20 º- 30 ºC/ 10 hours of light and 30 º- 20 ºC/ 10 hours of light. The X-ray protocol that best allowed viewing of internal seed structures was 30 Kv for 45 seconds. Seed separation using the <b>blower</b> <b>setting</b> at a 3. 0 opening for 30 seconds raised the number of embryonic seeds to values exceeding 99 %, also raising the germination rates as a consequence. The imbibition pattern is three-phased and the germination process is completed in 72 hours. Under alternate temperatures, primary root growth is favored...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is the {{analysis}} of manufacturing costs for the component of wheel´s <b>blower.</b> Followed by <b>setting</b> up the size of specific cutting force for milling operation of the titanium alloy Ti-Al 6 -Mo 2 -Cr 2 -Fe-Si, the used tool was a milling cutter which {{is made out of}} sintered carbide with conical and spherical face. The final values which are at intervals of 1500 to 1800 MPa were compared with the values of the Sandvik Coromant firm kc = 1690 MPa, for titanium alloy with the strenght in tension Rm = 1050 MPa...|$|R

5000|$|... 'Boat {{building}} uses many or {{the same}} tools that are common house tools such as hammers, cross cut saws, power drills, benches and vices. For building small boats under 5m some specialized tools are needed such as clamps (cramps) either G clamps or spring clamps. A minimum of 4 6inch(150mm) and 10 4inch(100mm) G clamps, plus 20 2 inch(50mm) steel spring clamps is need for ply on frame designs. More is better with clamps. Flat and round surform rasps are useful tools for shaping wood and ply. A drill set from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary sanding backing pads {{and a range of}} replacement sanding pads from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw drivers with blades to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an 8m(25 ft) tape, flat and round files for metal and wood, a short(torpedo) level and a set of 3 chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An 7 1/4inch (185mm) circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust <b>blower</b> with a <b>set</b> of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy. A steam box is excellent for making planks easier to bend although hot wet rags are a messy, but easy substitute. A fine tooth hacksaw is not only essential for cutting metal such as trimming stainless steel bolts to the correct length but is handy for ultra-fine cuts in thin wood. A fine-tooth tenon saw is used to cut across the grain to produce a reasonably fine, accurate cut. Some boat builders have started using Japanese draw saws for fine cuts but while these are excellent they tend to be very expensive. A No 4 smoothing plane is essential but an electric plane is very useful (but extremely loud) for making rudder blades and centre boards. A much longer No. 7 plane is needed if the design calls for a wooden spars as used in many modern [...] "traditional" [...] yachts.|$|R
