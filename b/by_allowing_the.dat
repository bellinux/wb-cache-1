5|$|As the {{campaign}} unfolded, Krueger was pressured by MacArthur to capture Manila. He sent messages reporting {{what he saw}} {{was a lack of}} drive among the troops, and even moved his theater headquarters forward of Krueger's. MacArthur tried to exploit Krueger's rivalry with Eichelberger <b>by</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> latter's Eighth Army to conduct its own drive on Manila from the south. Krueger eventually sent a flying column from the 1st Cavalry Division, but MacArthur's expectation that the Japanese would not defend Manila was proven incorrect. Weeks of ferocious fighting were required to capture the city.|$|E
5|$|Astaroth's {{gameplay}} {{was developed}} around {{the concept of}} a powerful fighter that struck at a distance, and has been noted as one of the strongest characters in the Soul series, requiring few mistakes to be made when fighting against Astaroth to defeat him. Measures were put into effect to make the character unique <b>by</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> player to hold attack buttons in order to strengthen attacks, to contrast against other large character fighting styles in Soulcalibur such as Nightmare's multiple fighting stances.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October 1918, under {{pressure}} by Germany, the Senate and Parliament elected a German prince, Friedrich Karl, brother-in-law of German Emperor William II, {{to become the}} King of Finland. Eventually, General RÃ¼diger von der Goltz was able to utilize the weakness of Finland for the power political benefit of the German Empire. All this diminished Finnish sovereignty. The Finns, both right and left, had achieved independence on 6 December 1917 without a gunshot, but then compromised it <b>by</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> Germans to enter the country without difficulty during the Civil War.|$|E

5|$|The public roads {{from the}} Indianapolis corner to the Porsche Curves were re-surfaced. Run-off areas at the Dunlop Chicane, Tertre Rouge, Indianapolis, and Ford Chicanes were also {{partially}} asphalted {{in order to}} avoid gravel being brought back onto the circuit by cars which had gone off course.

5|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} successful decompression {{is that the}} depth and ascent rate of the diver must be monitored and sufficiently accurately controlled. Practical in-water decompression requires a reasonable tolerance for variation in depth and rate of ascent, but unless the decompression is being monitored in real time by a decompression computer, any deviations from the nominal profile will affect the risk. Several items of equipment are used to assist in facilitating accurate adherence to the planned profile, <b>by</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> diver to more easily control depth and ascent rate, or to transfer this control to specialist personnel at the surface.|$|E
5|$|As Wilkinson's term ended, he {{appointed}} {{himself to a}} six-year term on the University of Kentucky's board of regents. The move was unprecedented, and was particularly controversial because of Wilkinson's open feuds with Charles T. Wethington, Jr., the university president. An incensed legislature passed a law shortly thereafter that dissolved the existing boards of trustees at all Kentucky public colleges and universities and mandated that they be reconstituted <b>by</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> governor to select each member {{from a list of}} three candidates recommended by an independent review board. Jones, who succeeded Wilkinson as governor, used the provisions of the law to remove Wilkinson and several of his appointees from the university boards.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, {{the club}} {{supported}} {{the war effort}} <b>by</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> ground {{to be used as}} a rifle range for military training. On the outbreak of the Second World War, all outdoor sport was banned by the Government until safety implications could be assessed. When football resumed a few weeks later, Birmingham's Chief Constable ordered the ground's closure because of its proximity to probable air-raid targets such as the BSA munitions factories. The matter was first raised in Parliament in November 1939, but the Home Secretary felt unable to intervene. By March 1940, when St Andrew's had for some time been the only football ground in England still closed, the Chief Constable bowed to public pressure, and a crowd of 13,241 witnessed Birmingham's first home game in more than six months.|$|E

At the beginning of March, fixed-wing aircraft began evacuating civilians from Tan Son Nhat Airport through neighboring countries. By mid-April, contingency plans were in place and preparations were underway for a possible helicopter evacuation. As the imminent collapse of Saigon became evident, Task Force 76 (TF76) was assembled off the coast near Vung Tau to support a helicopter evacuation and provide air support if required. In the event, air support was not needed as the North Vietnamese paused for {{a week at the}} outskirts of Saigon, possibly waiting for the South Vietnamese government to collapse and avoiding a possible confrontation with the U.S. <b>by</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> mostly-unopposed evacuation of Americans from Saigon.|$|E
5|$|Feeling {{the need}} to seek out truth creates a {{separation}} between {{the mind of a}} poet and the mind of a philosopher. The poem reconciles the two <b>by</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> pursuer of truth to reflect on his time of simply enjoying nature and God's presence. However, the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must {{go out and try to}} help humanity. Nature can be soothing, but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate. The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge's poems and is reinforced with the image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry. In Reflections, to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of the world like a coward. Instead, the individual is compelled to join with humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all.|$|E
5|$|In 1516, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, {{adopted the}} Reinheitsgebot (purity law), perhaps the oldest food-quality {{regulation}} {{still in use}} in the 21st century, according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water, hops and barley-malt. Beer produced before the Industrial Revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD, beer was also being produced and sold by European monasteries. During the Industrial Revolution, the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture, and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant {{by the end of}} the 19th century.

5|$|In 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds {{demonstrated}} that alpha particles are helium nuclei <b>by</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> particles {{to penetrate the}} thin glass wall of an evacuated tube, then creating a discharge in the tube to study the spectra of the new gas inside. In 1908, helium was first liquefied by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes by cooling the gas to less than one kelvin. He tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not solidify at atmospheric pressure. Onnes' student Willem Hendrik Keesom was eventually able to solidify 1cm3 of helium in 1926 by applying additional external pressure.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, the Southern Railway {{ordered a}} final batch of 15 {{locomotives}} (Nos.14001414) to expand class availability on the Southern Railway's network. These were built at Ashford works and {{differed from the}} previous 65 {{in a number of}} ways. The cabs of the final eight locomotives (Nos.14071414) were fitted for left-hand driving, which was adopted as standard by the Southern Railway. The original Nclass chimney was replaced with the lower-profile version used on the U1class, which increased route availability <b>by</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> locomotives to pass under lower bridges and tunnels. Maunsell had begun to research smoke deflection techniques to improve driver visibility on the King Arthur class between 1926 and 1927, which resulted in the adoption of a standard smoke deflector design for the Southern Railway. A smaller version was fitted to Nos.14001414 during building.|$|E
5|$|In Episode One players {{make their}} way through a linear series of levels and {{encounter}} various enemies and allies. The gameplay is broken up between combat-oriented challenges and physics-based puzzles. Episode One integrates tutorial-like tasks into the story to familiarize the player with new gameplay mechanics without breaking immersion. A head-up display appears on the screen to display the character's health, energy, and ammunition. Throughout the course of the game, the player accesses new weapons and ammunition that are used to defend the character from enemy forces. Unlike in Half-Life 2, where Gordon's initial weapon is the crowbar, Gordon first acquires the Gravity Gun, which plays {{a crucial role in the}} game <b>by</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> player to use physics to manipulate objects at a distance in both combat and puzzle-solving scenarios.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{its close}} in 2011, the {{operating}} budget was $341,000, which funded staffing, educational programs, and the museum's heating and lighting. In July 2011, Milford's Board of Aldermen approved allocating $26,000 via a $0.75 tax per ton of municipal solid waste, then representing the latest {{addition to a}} $100,000 fundraising drive. On August 25, 2011, the museum was closed after the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority Board of Directors voted to close the Garbage Museum immediately. In 2013, Connecticut State Senator Kevin C. Kelly introduced legislation to reopen the museum, but the amendment failed to garner support. In 2014, the Connecticut General Assembly approved a measure to fund the museum <b>by</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to award a grant of up to $100,000 to the Connecticut Resource Recovery Authority via funding of the Municipal Tipping Fee Fund.|$|E

5|$|The Garbage Museum was a waste-management themed museum {{located in}} Stratford, Connecticut, United States. Constructed and opened in 1994, the {{recycling}} facility and museum was constructed for {{a cost of}} $5 million and funded through a group of 19 local municipalities, collectively known as the Southwest Connecticut Recycling Committee. The museum was operated by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority which focused on empowering visitors with knowledge about waste management and allowed visitors to watch the sorting process of recyclables. The most iconic exhibit was Trash-o-saurus, a dinosaur sculpture made of garbage. Funding for the museum dropped in 2009 due to expiring contracts, but remained open until 2011. The closure of the museum followed a failed fundraising campaign. In 2014, the Connecticut General Assembly approved a measure to fund the museum <b>by</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to award a grant of up to $100,000 to the Connecticut Resource Recovery Authority.|$|E
