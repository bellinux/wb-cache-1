5|$|Another {{method that}} has been used to {{establish}} the date of eruption is tree-ring dating. Tree-ring data has shown that a large event interfering with normal tree growth in North America occurred during 1629–1628 (±65 years)BCE. Evidence of a climatic event around 1628BCE has been found in studies of growth depression of European oaks in Ireland and of Scotch pines in Sweden. <b>Bristlecone</b> <b>pine</b> frost rings also indicate a date of 1627BCE, supporting the late 1600sBCE dating. Procedural changes in how ice cores are interpreted would bring that data more in line with the dendrochronological numbers.|$|E

Such organisms are sometimes said to exhibit negligible senescence. The genetic aspect has also been demonstrated in studies of human centenarians.|$|E

25|$|Plants are {{referred}} to as annuals which live only one year, biennials which live two years, and perennials which live longer than that. The longest-lived perennials, woody-stemmed plants such as trees and bushes, often live for hundreds and even thousands of years (one may question whether or not they may die of old age). A giant sequoia, General Sherman {{is alive and well in}} its third millennium. A Great Basin <b>Bristlecone</b> <b>Pine</b> called Methuselah is 4,848 years old (as of 2017) and the <b>Bristlecone</b> <b>Pine</b> called Prometheus was a little older still, at least 4,844 years (and possibly as old as 5,000 years), when it was cut down in 1964. The oldest known plant (possibly oldest living thing) is a clonal Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) tree colony in the Fishlake National Forest in Utah called Pando at about 80,000 years. Lichen, a symbiotic algae and fungal proto-plant, such as Rhizocarpon geographicum can live upwards of 10,000 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate and}} flora of the Great Basin is {{strongly}} dependent on elevation: as the elevation increases, the precipitation increases and temperature decreases. Because of this, forests occur at higher elevations. Utah juniper/single-leaf pinyon (southern regions) and mountain mahogany (northern regions) form open pinyon-juniper woodland {{on the slopes}} of most ranges. Stands of limber pine and Great Basin <b>bristlecone</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus longaeva) can be found in some of the higher ranges. In riparian areas with dependable water cottonwoods (Populus fremontii) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) groves exist.|$|E

The saltpan is devoid of vegetation, {{and the rest of}} the valley floor and lower slopes have sparse cover, although where water is available, an abundance of vegetation is usually present.|$|E
500|$|More than 400 native {{plant species}} {{live in the}} park. There are three life zones in the park based on elevation: [...] The lowest areas of the park are {{dominated}} by dwarf forests of pinyon pine and juniper with manzanita, serviceberry, and antelope bitterbrush in between. aspen, cottonwood, water birch, and willow grow along streams. Ponderosa pine forests cover the mid-elevations with blue spruce and Douglas fir in water-rich areas and manzanita and bitterbrush as underbrush. Douglas fir and white fir, along with aspen and Engelmann spruce, make up the forests on the Paunsaugunt Plateau. The harshest areas have limber pine and ancient Great Basin <b>bristlecone</b> <b>pine,</b> some more than 1,600years old, holding on.|$|E
500|$|To {{produce a}} curve {{that can be}} used to relate {{calendar}} years to radiocarbon years, a sequence of securely dated samples is needed which can be tested to determine their radiocarbon age. The study of tree rings led to the first such sequence: individual pieces of wood show characteristic sequences of rings that vary in thickness because of environmental factors such as the amount of rainfall in a given year. These factors affect all trees in an area, so examining tree-ring sequences from old wood allows the identification of overlapping sequences. In this way, an uninterrupted sequence of tree rings can be extended far into the past. The first such published sequence, based on <b>bristlecone</b> <b>pine</b> tree rings, was created by Wesley Ferguson. Hans Suess used this data to publish the first calibration curve for radiocarbon dating in 1967. The curve showed two types of variation from the straight line: a long term fluctuation with a period of about 9,000 years, and a shorter term variation, often referred to as [...] "wiggles", with a period of decades. Suess said he drew the line showing the wiggles by [...] "cosmic schwung", by which he meant that the variations were caused by extraterrestrial forces. It was unclear for some time whether the wiggles were real or not, but they are now well-established. [...] These short term fluctuations in the calibration curve are now known as de Vries effects, after Hessel de Vries.|$|E

The size of mature conifers varies from less than one meter, to over 100 meters. The world's tallest, thickest, largest, and oldest living trees are all conifers.
