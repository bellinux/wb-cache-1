25|$|<b>Biocompatibility,</b> i.e., {{the ability}} to what level the silk will cause an immune response, is {{definitely}} a critical issue for biomaterials. The <b>biocompatibility</b> of silk arose during its increasing clinical use. Indeed, wax or silicone is usually used as a coating to avoid fraying and potential immune responses when silk fibers serve as suture materials. Although the lack of detailed characterization of silk fibers, such as {{the extent of the}} removal of sericin, the surface chemical properties of coating material, and the process used, make it difficult to determine the real immune response of silk fibers in literature, it is generally believed that sericin is the major cause of immune response. Thus, the removal of sericin is an essential step to assure <b>biocompatibility</b> in biomaterial applications of silk. However, further research fails to prove clearly the contribution of sericin to inflammatory responses based on isolated sericin and sericin based biomaterials. In addition, silk fibroin exhibits an inflammatory response similar to that of tissue culture plastic in vitro when assessed with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) or lower than collagen and PLA when implant rat MSCs with silk fibroin films in vivo. Thus, appropriate degumming and sterilization will assure the <b>biocompatibility</b> of silk fibroin, which is further validated by in vivo experiments on rats and pigs. There are still concerns about the long-term safety of silk-based biomaterials in the human body in contrast to these promising results. Even though silk sutures serve well, they exist and interact within a limited period depending on the recovery of wounds (several weeks), much shorter than that in tissue engineering. Another concern arises from biodegradation because the <b>biocompatibility</b> of silk fibroin does not necessarily assure the <b>biocompatibility</b> of the decomposed products. In fact, different levels of immune responses and diseases have been triggered by the degraded products of silk fibroin.|$|E
25|$|Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) – strong, chemical- and {{heat-resistant}} thermoplastic, <b>biocompatibility</b> {{allows for}} use in medical implant applications, aerospace moldings. One {{of the most expensive}} commercial polymers.|$|E
25|$|Many {{polycarbonate}} {{grades are}} used in medical applications and comply with both ISO 10993-1 and USP Class VI standards (occasionally referred to as PC-ISO). Class VI is the most stringent of the six USP ratings. These grades can be sterilized using steam at 120°C, gamma radiation, or by the ethylene oxide (EtO) method. However, scientific research indicates possible problems with <b>biocompatibility.</b> Dow Chemical strictly limits all its plastics with regard to medical applications. More recently, scientists at the IBM Almaden Research Center have developed aliphatic polycarbonates with improved <b>biocompatibility</b> and degradability for nanomedicine applications.|$|E
25|$|Bioprocess {{chromatography}} columns use cast acrylic tubes {{as an alternative}} to glass and stainless steel. These are pressure rated and satisfy stringent requirements of materials for <b>biocompatibility,</b> toxicity and extractables.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasons for}} using {{flexible}} PVC in these applications for over 50 years are numerous {{and based on}} cost effectiveness linked to transparency, light weight, softness, tear strength, kink resistance, suitability for sterilization and <b>biocompatibility.</b>|$|E
25|$|Emerging {{biotechnology}} and Biomedical research uses PMMA {{to create}} microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices, which require 100 micrometre-wide geometries for routing liquids. These small geometries {{are amenable to}} using PMMA in a biochip fabrication process and offers moderate <b>biocompatibility.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Biocompatibility</b> {{is related}} to the {{behavior}} of biomaterials in various environments under various chemical and physical conditions. The term may refer to specific properties of a material without specifying where or how the material is to be used. For example, a material may elicit little or no immune response in a given organism, and may or may not able to integrate with a particular cell type or tissue. The ambiguity of the term reflects the ongoing development of insights into how biomaterials interact with the human body and eventually how those interactions determine the clinical success of a medical device (such as pacemaker or hip replacement). Modern medical devices and prostheses are often made of more than one material—so it might not always be sufficient to talk about the <b>biocompatibility</b> of a specific material.|$|E
25|$|Biomaterials must be {{compatible}} with the body, and there are often issues of <b>biocompatibility</b> which must be resolved before a product can {{be placed on the}} market and used in a clinical setting. Because of this, biomaterials are usually subjected to the same requirements as those undergone by new drug therapies.|$|E
25|$|Collagen is {{the major}} {{component}} of the extracellular matrix and has been widely used in nerve regeneration and repair. Due to its smooth microgeometry and permeability, collagen gels are able to allow diffusion of molecules through them. Collagen resorption rates are able {{to be controlled by}} crosslinking collagen with polypoxy compounds. Additionally, collagen type I/III scaffolds have demonstrated good <b>biocompatibility</b> and are able to promote Schwann cell proliferation. However, collagen conduits filled with Schwann cells used to bridge nerve gaps in rats have shown surprisingly unsuccessful nerve regeneration compared to nerve autografts. This is because <b>biocompatibility</b> is not the only factor necessary for successful nerve regeneration; other parameters such as inner diameter, inner microtopography, porosity, wall thickness, and Schwann cell seeding density will need to be examined in future studies in order to improve the results obtained by these collagen I/III gels.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} use of Nephila silk lies in tissue engineering. A {{study from the}} Medizinische Hochschule Hannover reports that processed Nephila silk is an excellent scaffold material thanks to its <b>biocompatibility,</b> mechanical strengths, and its property to promote cell adhesion and proliferation. In particular, the silk acts as a suitable guiding material for peripheral nerve regrowth.|$|E
25|$|Bioactive {{glasses are}} {{a group of}} surface {{reactive}} glass-ceramics. The <b>biocompatibility</b> of these glasses has led them to be investigated extensively for use as implant materials {{in the human body}} to repair and replace diseased or damaged bone. Bioactive glass was invented in 1969 by Larry Hench {{and his colleagues at the}} University of Florida.|$|E
25|$|New {{biomaterials}} {{have been}} engineered to have ideal properties and functional customization: injectability, synthetic manufacture, <b>biocompatibility,</b> non-immunogenicity, transparency, nano-scale fibers, low concentration, resorption rates, etc. PuraMatrix, originating from the MIT labs of Zhang, Rich, Grodzinsky and Langer {{is one of}} these new biomimetic scaffold families which has now been commercialized and is impacting clinical tissue engineering.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{self-assembly}} {{is one of}} the few {{methods for}} creating biomaterials with properties similar in scale and chemistry to that of the natural in vivo extracellular matrix (ECM), a crucial step toward tissue engineering of complex tissues. Moreover, these hydrogel scaffolds have shown superiority in in vivo toxicology and <b>biocompatibility</b> compared to traditional macroscaffolds and animal-derived materials.|$|E
25|$|All {{the various}} hydrogels have {{different}} advantages and disadvantage, such as <b>biocompatibility,</b> protein stability, toxicity, or lifetime; for example, the gelling conditions for sol-gels may damage the protein, and, as a result, several copolymers, such as chitosan, may be added (making hybrid gels) or alternative monomers, such as glycol-modified tetraethoxysilane {{as it is}} more biocompatible than the commonly used methoxy- or ethoxy-modified tetraethoxysilane.|$|E
25|$|Aluminium oxide has {{previously}} {{been shown to be}} more biocompatible than HA in cell culture studies and has been suggested as the standard reference material when <b>biocompatibility</b> studies are required to investigate new products. The rate of exposure previously associated with the bioceramic implant (2%) was less than most reports on the HA or porous polyethylene implant (0% to 50%).|$|E
25|$|Recently Multi-Photon Processing (MPP) was {{employed}} for in vivo expperiments by engineering artificial cartilage constructs. An ex vivo histological examination showed that certain pore geometry and the pre-growing of chondrocytes (Cho) prior to implantation significantly improves {{the performance of}} the created 3D scaffolds. The achieved <b>biocompatibility</b> was comparable to the commercially available collagen membranes. The successful outcome of this study supports the idea that hexagonal-pore-shaped hybrid organic-inorganic microstructured scaffolds in combination with Cho seeding may be successfully implemented for cartilage tissue engineering.|$|E
25|$|Materials {{that have}} been used to make {{biologic}} tubes include blood vessels and skeletal muscles, while nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable synthetic tubes have been made from silicone and polyglycolide respectively. Tissue-engineered nerve guidance conduits are a combination of many elements: scaffold structure, scaffold material, cellular therapies, neurotrophic factors and biomimetic materials. The choice of which physical, chemical and biological cues to use is based on the properties of the nerve environment, which is critical in creating the most desirable environment for axon regeneration. The factors that control material selection include <b>biocompatibility,</b> biodegradability, mechanical integrity, controllability during nerve growth, implantation and sterilization.|$|E
25|$|Silk {{has been}} {{considered}} as a luxurious textile since 3630 BC. However, it started to serve also as a biomedical material for suture in surgeries decades ago. In the past 30 years, it has been widely studied and used as a biomaterial, which refers to materials used for medical applications in organisms, due to its excellent properties, including remarkable mechanical properties, comparative <b>biocompatibility,</b> tunable degradation rates in vitro and in vivo, the ease to load cellular growth factors (for example, BMP-2), {{and the ability to}} be processed into several other formats such as films, gels, particles, and scaffolds. Silks from Bombyx mori, a kind of cultivated silkworm, are the most widely investigated silks.|$|E
25|$|There are {{advantages}} to using biological polymers over synthetic polymers. They are {{very likely to}} have good <b>biocompatibility</b> and be easily degraded, because they are already present in nature in some form. However, there are also several disadvantages. They have unwieldy mechanical properties and degradation rates that cannot be controlled over a wide range. In addition, {{there is always the}} possibility that naturally-derived materials may cause an immune response or contain microbes. In the production of naturally-derived materials there will also be batch-to-batch variation in large-scale isolation procedures that cannot be controlled. Some other problems plaguing natural polymers are their inability to support growth across long lesion gaps due to the possibility of collapse, scar formation, and early re-absorption. Despite all these disadvantages, some of which can be overcome, biological polymers still prove to be the optimal choice in many situations.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogels are a {{class of}} {{biomaterials}} that are chemically or physically cross-linked water-soluble polymers. They can be either degradable or non-degradable as determined by their chemistry, but degradable is more desirable whenever possible. There has been great interest in hydrogels for tissue engineering purposes, because they generally possess high <b>biocompatibility,</b> mechanical properties similar to soft tissue, {{and the ability to}} be injected as a liquid that gels. When hydrogels are physically cross-linked they must rely on phase separation for gelation; the phase separation is temperature-dependent and reversible. Some other advantages of hydrogels are that they use only non-toxic aqueous solvents, allow infusion of nutrients and exit of waste products, and allow cells to assemble spontaneously. Hydrogels have low interfacial tension, meaning cells can easily migrate across the tissue-implant boundary. However, with hydrogels it is difficult to form a broad range of mechanical properties or structures with controlled pore size.|$|E
25|$|A {{synthetic}} polymer may be non-degradable or degradable. For {{the purpose}} of neural tissue engineering degradable materials are preferred whenever possible, because long-term effects such as inflammation and scar could severely damage nerve function. The degradation rate {{is dependent on the}} molecular weight of the polymer, its crystallinity, and the ratio of glycolic acid to lactic acid subunits. Because of a methyl group, lactic acid is more hydrophobic than glycolic acid causing its hydrolysis to be slower. Synthetic polymers have more wieldy mechanical properties and degradation rates that can be controlled over a wide range, and they eliminate the concern for immunogenicity. There are many different synthetic polymers currently being used in neural tissue engineering. However, the drawbacks of many of these polymers include a lack of <b>biocompatibility</b> and bioactivity, which prevents these polymers from promoting cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation. Synthetic conduits have only been clinically successful for the repair of very short nerve lesion gaps less than 1–2cm. Furthermore, nerve regeneration with these conduits has yet to reach the level of functional recovery seen with nerve autografts.|$|E
25|$|Hyaluronic acid (HA) is {{a widely}} used {{biomaterial}} {{as a result of}} its excellent <b>biocompatibility</b> and its physiologic function diversity. It is abundant in the extracellular matrix (ECM) where it binds large glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans through specific HA-protein interactions. HA also binds cell surface receptors such as CD44, which results in the activation of intracellular signaling cascades that regulate cell adhesion and motility and promote proliferation and differentiation. HA is also known to support angiogenesis because its degradation products stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Thus, HA plays a pivotal role in maintaining the normal processes necessary for tissue survival. Unmodified HA has been used in clinical applications such as ocular surgery, wound healing, and plastic surgery. HA can be crosslinked to form hydrogels. HA hydrogels that were either unmodified or modified with laminin were implanted into an adult central nervous system lesion and tested for their ability to induce neural tissue formation in a study by Hou et al.. They demonstrated the ability to support cell ingrowth and angiogenesis, in addition to inhibiting glial scar formation. Also, the HA hydrogels modified with laminin were able to promote neurite extension. These results support HA gels as a promising biomaterial for a nerve guidance conduit.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to spiders, silkworms are {{another source of}} silk. Protein from Bombyx mori silkworms is a core of fibroin protein surrounded by sericin, which is a family of glue-like proteins. Fibroin has been characterized as a heavy chain with a repeated hydrophobic and crystallizable sequence: Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-Gly-X (X stands for Ser or Tyr). The surrounding sericin is more hydrophilic due to many polar residues, but it does still have some hydrophobic β-sheet portions. Silks have been long been used as sutures due to their high mechanical strength and flexibility as well as permeability to water and oxygen. In addition, silk fibroin can be easily manipulated and sterilized. However, silk use halted when undesirable immunological reactions were reported. Recently, it has been discovered {{that the cause of}} the immunological problems lies solely with the surrounding sericin. Since this discovery, silk with the sericin removed has been used in many pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. Because it is necessary to remove the sericin from around the fibroin before the silk can be used, an efficient procedure needs to be developed for its removal, which is known as degumming. One degrumming method uses boiling aqueous Na2CO3 solution, which removes the sericin without damaging the fibroin. Yang, Chen et al. demonstrated that the silk fibroin and silk fibroin extract fluid show good <b>biocompatibility</b> with Schwann cells, with no cytotoxic effects on proliferation.|$|E
2500|$|A {{commonly}} used synthetic material is PLA - polylactic acid. This is a polyester which degrades within {{the human body}} to form lactic acid, a naturally occurring chemical which is easily removed from the body. Similar materials are polyglycolic acid (PGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL): their degradation mechanism {{is similar to that}} of PLA, but they exhibit respectively a faster and a slower rate of degradation compared to PLA. While these materials have well maintained mechanical strength and structural integrity, they exhibit a hydrophobic nature. [...] This hydrophobicity inhibits their <b>biocompatibility,</b> which makes them less effective for in vivo use as tissue scaffolding. In order to fix the lack of <b>biocompatibility,</b> much research has been done to combine these hydrophobic materials with hydrophilic and more biocompatible hydrogels. While these hydrogels have a superior <b>biocompatibility,</b> they lack the structural integrity of PLA, PCL, and PGA. By combining the two different types of materials, researchers are trying to create a synergistic relationship that produces a more biocompatible tissue scaffolding.|$|E

2500|$|Of {{particular}} interest since the 1980s {{has been the}} deposition of functionalized plasma polymer films. For example, functionalized films are used {{as a means of}} improving <b>biocompatibility</b> for biological implants6 and for producing super-hydrophobic coatings.They have also been extensively employed in biomaterials for cell attachment, protein binding and as anti-fouling surfaces. Through the use of low power and pressure plasma, high functional retention can be achieved which has led to substantial improvements in the <b>biocompatibility</b> of some products, a simple example being the development of extended wear contact lenses. Due to these successes, the huge potential of functional plasma polymers is slowly being realised by workers in previously unrelated fields such as water treatment and wound management.Emerging technologies such as nanopatterning, 3D scaffolds, micro-channel coating and microencapsulation are now also utilizing functionalized plasma polymers, areas for which traditional polymers are often unsuitable ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the medical}} {{industry}} ultrasonic welding {{is often used}} {{because it does not}} introduce contaminants or degradation into the weld and the machines can be specialized for use in clean rooms. The process can also be highly automated, provides strict control over dimensional tolerances and does not interfere with the <b>biocompatibility</b> of parts. [...] Therefore, it increases part quality and decreases production costs. Items such as arterial filters, anesthesia filters, blood filters, IV catheters, dialysis tubes, pipettes, cardiometry reservoirs, blood/gas filters, face masks and IV spike/filters can all be made using ultrasonic welding. [...] Another important application in the medical industry for ultrasonic welding is textiles. [...] Items like hospital gowns, sterile garments, masks, transdermal patches and textiles for clean rooms can be sealed and sewn using ultrasonic welding. This prevents contamination and dust production and reduces the risk of infection.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the immune}} {{response}} and repair {{functions in the}} body are so complicated it is not adequate to describe the <b>biocompatibility</b> of a single material {{in relation to a}} single cell type or tissue.

TiN has been suggested as the friction surface in hip prostheses. While cell culture tests show a good <b>biocompatibility,</b> the analysis of implants shows significant wear, related to a delaminating of the TiN layer.
