The results allow us to conclude that controlling shareholders use the shareholder agreements as a mechanism to enhance control at the expense of firm value (entrenchment effect).

50|$|As the premiers did {{not come}} to an {{agreement}} on this question, the Parliamentary Council was supposed to address this issue. Its provisions are reflected in Article 29. There was a <b>binding</b> <b>provision</b> for a new delimitation of the federal territory: the Federal Territory must be revised (paragraph 1). Moreover, in territories or parts of territories whose affiliation with a Land had changed after 8 May 1945 without a referendum, people were allowed to petition for a revision of the current status within a year after the promulgation of the Basic Law (paragraph 2). If at least one tenth of those entitled to vote in Bundestag elections were in favour of a revision, the federal government had to include the proposal into its legislation. Then a referendum was required in each territory or part of a territory whose affiliation was to be changed (paragraph 3). The proposal should not take effect if within any of the affected territories a majority rejected the change. In this case, the bill had to be introduced again and after passing had to be confirmed by referendum in the Federal Republic as a whole (paragraph 4). The reorganization should be completed within three years after the Basic Law had come into force (paragraph 6).|$|R

Chapter One summarizes the development of public tender legislation in the Czech Republic, defines current legislation both in the Czech Republic and in the European Union. Chapter Two defines basic terms of the public tenders area which are typical and characteristic only for public tenders and which are not used in other fields of Czech law. The two remaining chapters are devoted to the qualifying requirements and evaluating criteria, their role and types.

The <b>binding</b> <b>provisions</b> of law concerning discretionary powers of auditing companies proprietary rights, to some extent, petrify the current auditing market structure. By means of numerous capital access deterrents they {{make it impossible to}} compete with the most influential entities on the market. Bearing in mind the vital influence of statutory auditors on companies functioning, and allowing the companies access to capital, it is advisable to abolish all binding restrictions and simultaneously strengthen the internal control mechanisms facilitating high quality of financial review and statutory auditors independence. The auditing services market is, most of all, subject to price competition. The binding requisition of statutory auditors (including auditing companies) salary disclosure intensifies mutual chain of audit pricing dependence and restricts competition. Properly utilized rotation principle, by strengthening the competence, might positively influence functioning of the auditing services market.

However, since agricultural trade is increasingly determined by food safety and quality standards, {{one of the main}} concerns of ACP countries is their inability to benefit from their preferential status due to their lack of compliance with EU food quality requirements. Recently, this dilemma has become of particular interest because the unilateral preferential access provided under the Cotonou Agreement no longer conforms with World Trade Organization (WTO) law, instead reciprocal trade agreements, the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), should replace the former ones in 2008. ACP countries' ability to access EU markets and thereby gain from the new trade agreements largely depends on the progress they have made in adjusting their food safety systems to international standards.

For {{the purpose of}} this analysis treaties that have not been widely ratified, treaties that have been signed but are not yet in force as well as sources of soft law have been chosen to reflect elements of best practice with regards to the rights of seasonal workers. Treaties, conventions and regulations that are widely ratified often only constitute the lowest level of common interest that can be agreed upon and can thus be considered as ensuring a minimum standard of protection. In order to define best practice it seems to be more promising to turn to provisions that have not been widely ratified and elements of soft law, which are not legally <b>binding.</b> These <b>provisions</b> are more likely to contain encompassing social protection rights for workers that address their specific needs and should thus be considered as benchmark provisions.|$|R

The principle of voluntariness applies {{to the right of}} parties to self-determination once they are in the mediation—not to the mechanism for initiating the mediation process. Many mediations also result form mutual consent because they are non-binding and they encourage the exploration of interests and mutual benefits of an agreement.

The author advocates that generally <b>binding</b> <b>provisions</b> are too skeleton-like, while banking instructions contain many institutions and solutions colliding with basic acts. The author states on completion of his study that a civil law character of credit relations cannot be adopted without reservations, as both mechanism and procedure of crediting are a substantial departure from rules of entering and executing contracts of civil law. Crediting activities of the socialist banks exceeds usual functions of a credit-giver (lender), what is justified under conditions of socialized economy. The presently adopted model of economy and administration implies however economic independence of state enterprises and liability of several subjects for results of enterpris e s ' activities.

In addition, recent academic evidence on the level of voting for directors suggests that almost all directors currently receive a majority of votes anyway. We examine the impact of financial and other governance characteristics on both the probability that a firm receives a majority election proposal and on the probability of adoption. Our evidence suggests that firms with large pension obligations and poorly performing firms are more likely to receive majority proposals. These firms as well as those with higher outside board representation and fewer shareholder rights are more likely to adopt the proposals.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{the purpose of this}} {{dissertation}} to analyze a contemporary battlefield of law, the field of EU social rights, from a political-philosophical point of view. It is the conviction of the dissertation that law is deeply and inescapably conceptually connected with fundamental features of social order. Law and social order are not presumed to be identical, but to be mutually constitutive. The interrelations between the two do not merely concern the rights and obligations explicitly laid down in the law, but fundamental presumptions regarding the nature of human beings, overall purposes of social order, hierarchical and dynamical features of society and the possibility at all of regulation, its logics and sources of authority. On the basis of a historical-conceptual understanding of law according to which law, social structure and metaphysical presumptions are inescapably intertwined, the dissertation derives from the <b>binding</b> <b>provisions</b> of law certain essential features of social order. More precisely, the dissertation demonstrates that from a political philosophical point of view, EU social rights can be said to imply the contours of a particular social order. Significantly, the essential features in question are derived through detailed analyses of EU social rights - through critical investigations of definitions of right-holders, material scope, legal core concepts, exclusions and justifications, complexities and ambiguities of interpretation. The general point is the following: Political philosophical features of social order may not only be derived from the overall constitutional aspects of law (in the case of EU-law: fundamental principles inscribed in the Treaty; the constitutional architecture of EU-law), but are implied in the detailed material web of secondary law...|$|E
40|$|The local {{government}} system in Western Australia has two unique characteristics. It {{is the only}} state in Australia where there has not been significant reform of the sector. In addition, it {{is the only state}} where legislation contains <b>binding</b> <b>provisions</b> for a poll of electors on {{local government}} amalgamations. It would be reasonable to conclude that these two characteristics are linked. Referenda – the holding of a direct vote on a specific issue – are in common use around the world at every level of government, with the June 2016 Brexit poll being a well-known example. A distinction might be made between mandatory referenda, such as those provided for under certain circumstances in Western Australia’s Local Government Act 1995, with conditions to be met for a binding result, and optional referenda, initiated by local government, which are non-binding and indicative, possibly assisting local government decision making. Further, reference might be made to the ‘popular referendum’, where the means is provided for a petition signed by a certain minimum number of registered voters to force a public vote, a form of direct democracy (Wikipedia, 2016; ACE, 2016). Although Western Australia is the only state in Australia with legislation provisions governing a binding elector’s poll on local government amalgamations, there are poll provisions in place in New Zealand (Local Government Act 2002, schedule 3) and in some parts of Canada (such as in British Columbia: Local Government Act 1996, s 8).
