40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission (EC), the Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on the Risk for Human and Animal Health related to the revision of the <b>BSE</b> <b>Monitoring</b> regime in some Member States. The BIOHAZ Panel was invited to provide an assessment {{on the existence of}} a significant additional risk, if any, to human and animal health, compared with the situation at the time following the implementation of a revised <b>BSE</b> <b>monitoring</b> regime in the old 15 European Member States (EU 15) 2. The Panel was asked to consider age options between 30 and 60 months (with 6 months intervals) for BSE testing of healthy slaughtered cattle and between 24 months to 60 months (with 6 months intervals) for testing of at risk cattle in EU 15 and compare the different scenarios. It was then clarified with the EC that the mandate was focused on the assessment of possible differences between the BSE surveillance system at the time and the proposed review in terms of efficiency to monitor the epidemiological situation in the cattle population. Moreover, the term “significant ” inserted in the terms of reference of the mandate was not to be considered in its statistical meaning...|$|E
40|$|The Cattle TSE Monitoring Model (C-TSEMM), {{developed}} for EFSA by a contractor, allows evaluating different {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (<b>BSE)</b> <b>monitoring</b> regimes (implemented or hypothetical) in cattle {{and the ability of}} those schemes to detect either the re-emergence of BSE or {{the emergence of a new}} transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) disease in cattle, by estimating the trend of the current BSE epidemic within European Union Member States. C-TSEMM was developed as a transparent and flexible software package in R, supported by a user-friendly interface in VBA for users to input parameter estimates and alternative monitoring scenarios. The model has been applied to assess the minimum sample size to test in different <b>BSE</b> <b>monitoring</b> scenarios in certain Member States, and to assess the added value of that sample size for monitoring the trend of BSE and the emergence of a hypothetical new type of cattle TSE. C-TSEMM includes BSE data for two example countries (country MM, representing a medium-sized country with TSE testing started in 2003 and some BSE positive findings; country LL, representing a large-sized country with TSE testing started in 2002 and a high number of BSE positive findings). C-TSEMM can be run with those fictitious data, or after inclusion of real data for any country of interest by the user...|$|E
40|$|With a total EU {{expenditure}} of € 880 {{million for the}} period 2007 - 2011, the report shows that good {{progress has been made}} in the majority of EU co-financed veterinary programmes with continuous expansion in disease free zones for Bovine Tuberculosis, Bovine Brucellosis, Bluetongue, Enzootic Bovine Leucosis and Aujeszky's Disease. The implementation of <b>BSE</b> <b>monitoring</b> and eradication programmes led to a dramatic drop in the detected BSE cases within the period. In the case of Rabies, the co-funded oral vaccination programmes have proved very successful as they have led to the steady eradication of Rabies from several Member States. This is unique in the world as the EU has achieved a level of Rabies eradication that has never been experienced anywhere else before. Classical Swine Fever (CSF) in domestic pigs has been eradicated all over Europe. In wild boar, the restricted zones have been lifted due to the proved absence of virus circulation in most of the EU territories. The implementation of Avian Influenza (AI) surveillance programmes has been another success. Surveillance programmes for the disease have proven effective in providing early warning for the timely detection of outbreaks of both high and low pathogenic strains...|$|E
40|$|Species {{identification}} {{represents a}} critical issue in food chain safety and quality control. Several procedures are available to detect animal proteins in cattle feed or to trace transgenic foods. The most effective approach {{is based on the}} use of DNA as a marker. Amplification of DNA provides rapid, sensitive and specific protocols. Several target genes can be used, but new insights come from the mitochondrial genome, which is naturally amplified in each cell and shows a remarkable resistance to degradation. These are key points when analysing complex matrices such as foods, animal feedstuff or environmental samples. Traceability is important to prevent <b>BSE</b> or to <b>monitor</b> novel foods, such as genetically modified organisms. Amplification is commonly performed, but it requires expertise and a molecular biology laboratory to perform restriction analysis, electrophoresis or gel staining for the visualisation of results. Hereby, we consider a strategy based on multiple nested amplification and reverse hybridisation assay that virtually requires only a thermocycler and a water bath. The protocol is rapid and simple and can simultaneously detect different species in a DNA sample. This promising approach allows microarray developments, opening up to further perspectives. An international application has been published under the patent cooperation treaty. Presently, a ban on feeding ruminants on cattle-derived proteins is in force in Europe and USA. The identification of metazoan traces in a sample is not only a mere preventive measure for BSE, but represents a possible screening system for monitoring biotechnology products and procedures, as well as a quality control strategy to assure consumer's rights...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE) epidemic {{and the emergence of}} a new human variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) have led to profound changes in the production and trade of agricultural goods. The rapid tests currently approved for <b>BSE</b> <b>monitoring</b> in slaughtered cattle are all based on the detection of the disease related isoform of the prion protein, PrP d, in brain tissue and consequently are only suitable for post-mortem diagnosis. Objectives: In instances such as assessing the health of breeding stock for export purposes where post-mortem testing is not an option, there is a demand for an ante-mortem test based on a matrix or body fluid that would permit easy access and repeated sampling. Urine and urine based analyses would meet these requirements. Results Two dimensional differential gel eletrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry analyses were used to identify proteins exhibiting differential abundance in the urine of BSE infected cattle and age matched controls over the course of the disease. Multivariate analyses of protein expression data identified a single protein able to discriminate, with 100 % accuracy, control from infected samples. In addition, a subset of proteins were able to predict with 85 % ± 13. 2 accuracy the time post infection that the samples were collected. Conclusion These results suggest that in principle it is possible to identify biomarkers in urine useful in the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of disease progression of transmissible {{spongiform encephalopathy}} diseases (TSEs). </p...|$|E
40|$|This Scientific Report of EFSA {{provides}} {{scientific and}} technical assistance to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) Surveillance Authority in evaluating i) if from a cattle BSE epidemiological point of view, it is acceptable to consider Norway and EU 25 as a unique epidemiological unit; and ii) in case the latter can be done, if no healthy slaughtered animals need to be tested {{in order to meet}} a yearly design prevalence of 1 detectable case in 100, 000 adult cattle at a confidence level of 95 % when all at-risk animals above 48 months of age in Norway and the EU are tested. Historical and current Norwegian risk management measures on the removal of the Specified Risk Material and on the feed ban were considered, together with the results of the Norwegian <b>BSE</b> <b>monitoring</b> regime. The Cattle-TSE Monitoring Model (C-TSEMM) was used to estimate the yearly achievable design prevalence in Norway and to answer the second term of reference of the mandate. The C-TSEMM estimates were provided on the basis of data related to 2011. It is concluded that from a cattle BSE epidemiological point of view Norway and EU 25 can be considered as a unique epidemiological unit. Moreover, based on C-TSEMM estimates, when EU 25 and Norway are considered as a unique epidemiological unit, and the systematic testing of at-risk animals above 48 months of age is maintained, healthy slaughtered animals would not need to be tested in order to meet a yearly design prevalence of 1 detectable case in 100, 000 adult cattle at a confidence level of 95 %...|$|E
40|$|This Scientific Report of EFSA {{provides}} {{scientific and}} technical assistance to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) Surveillance Authority in evaluating i) if the Norwegian continuous use of fishmeal in feed for ruminants until 30 April 2010 has {{had an impact on}} the overall risk of BSE in the country; and ii) if a proposed Norwegian revised annual monitoring programme for BSE allows the detection of BSE with a yearly design prevalence of at least one case per 100, 000 in the adult population at a confidence level of 95 %. Data related to the implementation of the Norwegian feed ban were collected and assessed. The Cattle TSE Monitoring Model (C-TSEMM) was used in order to answer the second term of reference of the mandate received. It is concluded that the use of fishmeal in feed for ruminants might have had a potential impact on the risk of cattle exposure to BSE in Norway. While it is not possible to quantitatively assess this risk, the lack of detection of BSE cases by the Norwegian monitoring system (in spite of its sensitivity limits) suggests that BSE has not significantly spread in the Norwegian cattle population. The proposed revised Norwegian <b>BSE</b> <b>monitoring</b> regime would not be able to meet a yearly design prevalence of at least one case per 100, 000 in the adult cattle population at a confidence level of 95 %. Moreover, in statistical terms it is not feasible for Norway to achieve the requested design prevalence. It is furthermore highlighted that passing from a sample-based to an exhaustive monitoring scheme (i. e. testing all animals over a certain age that are slaughtered or dead) would provide the most sensitive BSE surveillance system currently possible...|$|E
40|$|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) are {{neurological}} degenerative diseases {{for which}} the prototypes are scrapie in sheep, some forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in man and the bovine spongiform encephalpopathy (BSE) in cattle. Everybody has in mind the “mad cow ” epidemic that emerged in 1986 and suddenly revived {{at the end of}} 2000. Since then, over 189, 000 cases of affected cows have been reported, more than 97 % of them in the United Kingdom, 2. 9 % {{in the rest of the}} European Union (EU) and a few cases in the rest of the world, including USA, Canada and Japan. In order to avoid a further spread of BSE and its human form, the new variant CJD, the European Commission (EC) has taken several actions. To guarantee consumers ’ s a f e t y, the EU has decided to organize the monitoring and the control of BSE in various ways. Diagnostic methods to detect BSE include the classical post mort e m examination of central nervous system (CNS) tissue by histopathology or immunohistochemistry and, more recently, by the use of rapid immunoassays. So far the European Commission has already evaluated a wide number of rapid p o s t m o rt e mtests for the diagnosis of BSE in cattle. A m o n g these tests several ones have been approved for <b>BSE</b> <b>monitoring.</b> More than ten million BSE tests per year are currently carried out within the EU. Official food control also demands methods for detecting tissues of CNS in meat products. Several approaches have been developed so far, methods using tissue specific DNA detection, immunochemical methods based on the detection of neurone specific enolase (NSE) and glial fibrillary protein (GFAP). The last two methods have been recently validated in a collaborative trial. Additional approaches to differentiate between muscle and non-muscle tissues such as liver, kidney and heart have been developed using gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS) by the detection of specific fatty acids...|$|E
