40|$|Introduction:The <b>bean</b> <b>common</b> <b>blight</b> {{caused by}} Xanthomonas axonpodis pv. phaseoli {{is one of}} the most {{important}} pathogens of bean, which is a serious problem to produce this crop in western regions of the country. Due to the severe damage of this pathogen, using fungal and bacterial bio-control agents can be as an efficient way to reduce the damage of disease on bean. The aim of this study was to evaluate the controller effects of fungal and bacterial biological agents including Trichoderma harzianum, T. virens, Bacillus subtillis and Pseudomonas fluorescence in laboratory and greenhouse conditions on bacteria of <b>bean</b> <b>common</b> <b>blight.</b> Materials and methods: In order to study the effects of biological agent against Xap, in the first stage, was to investigate the percentage growth inhibition of Xapby biological agents under laboratory conditions. In the next step, the interaction of biological agent and pathogenesis bacteria on bean plant was evaluated in a completely randomized design, four replications and biological agent’s treatments are under the greenhouse conditions. Indices such as root and shoot fresh weight, root and shoot dry weight, height roots and stems of beans and disease severity were measured to analyse the control power of the biological agents. Results: In laboratory conditions, fungal biological agents of T. harzianum with an average diameter of inhibitor halo of 42 mm and inhibiting 56. 67 % of the growth had highest controller effect on pathogenesis bacteria. However, in greenhouse conditions, P. fluorescence bacteria had better performance and all plant indices under this treatment showed a significant growth. The combined treatment of P. fleurescence + T. virens was the best treatment in this experiment with reducing 79. 4 % of disease symptoms. Treatments P. fleurescence+T. harzianum and B. subtillis+P. fleurescence with amount of 69. 6 and 55. 9 % reduced the symptoms, respectively, and are in following levels. Discussion and conclusion: Therefore, the use of biological agents can largely reduce the <b>bean</b> <b>common</b> <b>blight,</b> so that it can be an efficient and environmentally friendly method used...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the role of relative humidity rate, host genotype, inoculation method and growth stage in epidemiology of <b>bean</b> <b>common</b> <b>blight,</b> two greenhouse experiments were carried out monitoring epiphytic population size of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli (Xap) and disease severity. The result showed significant differences among genotypes, inoculation methods and growth stages for epiphytic population size and sam effects except genotypes for disease severity. The epiphytic population size was significantly higher on spray inoculated Khomein cultivar of bean during flowering (R 6). However, the relative humidity rates did not significantly affect population dynamics of epiphytic Xap and the disease severity. Two field experiments were also carried out {{to determine the effects}} of irrigation systems (furrow irrigation and overhead sprinkler irrigation), inoculation method, growth stage and their interactions on epiphytic population size of Xap and disease severity. The result showed that the epiphytic population size and disease severity were higher on spray inoculated plants irrigated with overhead sprinkler system during pods filling (R 8). In this study, a significant positive correlation was found between epiphytic population size of Xap and bean common bacterial blight severity...|$|E
40|$|Systematic {{sampling}} of waterways and irrigation runoff from agricultural {{lands in the}} North Platte Project of Nebraska in July and August of 1972 – 1974 demonstrated that phytopathogenic organisms were disseminated. The organisms monitored included the <b>bean</b> <b>common</b> <b>blight</b> bacterium Xanthomonas phaseoli, the bean white mold fungus Whetzelinia sclerotiorum and various nematodes. Although many types of nematodes often were recovered from irrigation water, Heterodera sp. cysts which cause significant disease problems in the valley were found infrequently. Patterns of movement of the bacterial and fungal organisms were correlated with previous or current season infection of bean plants. The short-term survival of X. phaseoli in sterile deionized water may explain the detection of this organism only in runoff or ditches receiving runoff from common blight infected bean fields. Sclerotial bodies of W. sclerotiorum remained viable for at least 10 – 21 days in flowing water and were found throughout the irrigation waterways. Irrigation of beans with contaminated water can result in both common blight and white mold diseases. Dissemination of phytopathogenic organisms in irrigation reuse systems as well as agricultural land runoff {{should be considered in}} irrigation planning and system design...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the survival of a strain of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli var. fuscans (Xap), resistant to streptomycin sulphate, in <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> leaflets placed on the soil surface and buried at a depth of 10 and 15 cm. Four assays were carried out from November 1998 to December 2000 in Bandeirantes (Paraná, Brazil). The leaflets were collect-ed every 15 days, crushed and the dilution-plated on a semi-selective medium. Under mild temperatures and low rainfall, Xap survived for 65 to 180 days in the leaflets on the soil surface, and for 30 to 120 days in those incorporated in the soil, regardless of the depth. When higher rainfall and temperatures occurred, the survival was from 45 to 60 days in the leaflets on the soil surface and from 30 to 45 days in those buried 10 or 15 cm deep.

30|$|In recent years, <b>bean</b> <b>common</b> {{bacterial}} <b>blight</b> (CBB) {{caused by}} Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli (Xap) has caused serious yield losses in several countries. CBB is considered mainly a foliar disease in which symptoms initially appear as small water-soaked spots that then enlarge and become necrotic and usually bordered by a chlorotic zone. Xap epiphytic population community has {{a critical role}} in the development of the disease and subsequent epidemics. The epiphytic population of Xap in the field has two major parts; solitary cells (potentially planktonic) and biofilms which are sources for providing and refreshing the solitary cell components. Irrigation type has a significant effect on epiphytic population of Xap. The mean epiphytic population size in the field with an overhead sprinkler irrigation system is significantly higher than populations under furrow irrigation. A significant positive correlation between the epiphytic population size of Xap and disease severity has been reported in both the overhead irrigated (r= 0.64) and the furrow irrigated (r= 0.44) fields.|$|R

In addition, botanical extracts of garlic (Alium sativum), ginger (Zingiber oficinale), and turmeric (Curcuma domestica) were screened and evaluated in vitro for their effects as seed dressings on Xap seed infection and viability of the seed.

40|$|The {{tropical}} forage legume Clitoria ternatea (L.) {{has important}} agronomic traits such as adaptation {{to a wide}} range of soil conditions and resistance to drought. It is resistant to a number of pathogens and pests. These important traits gave us reasons to look more closely at the plant. A highly basic small protein was purified from seeds of C. ternatea to homogeneity by using ultrafiltration with Centricon- 3 membrane tubes and preparative granulated-bed isoelectric focusing (IEF). A single protein band was obtained on both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and IEF gels. The protein, designated ‘finotin’, has broad and potent inhibitory effect on the growth of various important fungal pathogens of plants, namely Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium solani, Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Pyricularia grisea, Bipolaris oryzae and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.

40|$|Many {{diseases}} limit dry {{bean and}} snap <b>bean</b> yields. <b>Common</b> bacterial <b>blight</b> (CBB), caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli, {{is one of}} the most serious bacterial diseases in dry bean and snap bean that cause crop losses. Since there is no satisfactory chemical control, the use of resistant cultivars is an important control measure. Genetic studies of resistance are important for choosing appropriate breeding methods. Combining ability was determined for disease resistance in three snap bean genotypes (Alessa, Hab 52 and Hab 198) and two dry bean genotypes (Bac- 6 and A- 794). Plants were inoculated with highly pathogenic isolate CNF 15, using a razor blade procedure in leaves and needle punctures in pods. They were evaluated 7 days after inoculation. Leaves were evaluated on a 1 to 5 scale and pods by lesion diameter. Diallel analysis was conducted using Griffing's model. General combining ability (GCA) was significant for both leaf and pod infection, whereas specific combining ability (SCA) was significant for disease reaction in pods. Bac- 6 and A- 794 were considered superior genotypes for leaf resistance. Nonadditive effects were predominant in pod reactions, and Alessa x Bac- 6, Alessa x A- 794 and Hab 52 x Bac- 6 were the best combinations...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine reaction of a <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> core collection from the Iberian Peninsula to anthracnose, rust, <b>common</b> and halo <b>blights,</b> <b>bean</b> <b>common</b> mosaic virus (BCMV, a potyvirus) and <b>bean</b> <b>common</b> mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV, a potyvirus) pathogens. Of 43 accessions evaluated, 14 large-seeded Andean type, seven small-seeded Middle American type and seven with intermediate characteristics or recombinant type between the two gene pools had resistant reaction to one or more diseases. Resistance to race 17 or 23 of anthracnose pathogen was present in 17 accessions and four accessions were resistant to both races. Resistance to race 38 or 53 of rust pathogen was shown by 22 accessions and five accessions were resistant to both races. All accessions were susceptible to <b>common</b> bacterial <b>blight</b> and 12 accessions had resistance to halo blight. Ten accessions showed resistance to BCMV, none to BCMNV, and two were variable to both viruses. Accessions such as PHA- 0573 (pinto), PHA- 0589 (marrow), PHA- 0654 (favada pinto), and PHA- 0706 (favada) showed resistance to two or more diseases.

40|$|The {{release of}} ‘Starlight’, a Great Northern dry bean {{cultivar}} (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), fulfills a need in western Nebraska for a cultivar {{with a relatively}} large seed size and a uniformly bright-white seedcoat (Korban et al., 1981). Foreign buyers of Great Northern beans desire a larger seed than the current predominant Great Northern cultivar Beryl (J. A. McGill, Jr., personal communication). In addition, the cultivar possesses improved architectural avoidance mechanisms to white mold disease (WMD) incited by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary (Coyne, 1980), a serious problem in some seasons in western Nebraska. Origin ‘Starlight’ (evaluated as F 10 WM 1 - 85 - 43) was derived by pedigree selection from a cross of the F 5 breeding lines GN-WM 2 - 79 - 12 and GN-SK- 80 - 45. These lines were derived from crosses of ‘Tacaragua’ from Venezuela (black seed, upright architecture, and resistance to rust) × GN Nebraska # 1 selection 27 [resistant to <b>common</b> bacterial <b>blight</b> incited by Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli (Smith) Dye] and ‘GN Emerson’ (large white seed and moderate resistance to <b>common</b> <b>blight)</b> × ‘Bulgarian White’ (unadapted line with late maturity and large white seed), respectively. GN WM 2 - 79 - 12 is resistant to rust, <b>bean</b> <b>common</b> mosaic virus (BCMV), and <b>common</b> bacterial <b>blight</b> and has a moderately upright and open habit of growth, which contributed to its avoidance of WMD.

Gray) is of {{interest}} for its intrinsic value as an under-exploited crop adapted to hot arid climates, and as a potential donor of desirable traits to the <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> P. vulgaris L.) through interspecific hybridiza-tion. Teparies possess several traits that could be valuable if transferred to <b>common</b> <b>beans.</b> Teparies are more heat and drought resistant than <b>common</b> <b>beans.</b> They tolerate higher salt (Marcarian, 1981) and boron concentrations in the soil (C. J. Lovatt, personal communication; J. G. Waines, unpubl.). They are tolerant of damage by lesser cornstalk borer, Elasmo-palpus lignosellus Zeller (Thomas, 1983). They show field res-istance to charcoal rot, caused by Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid (Thomas, 1983). All of these factors combine to produce a plant that performs well in hot, semiarid climates. In addition, they show high levels of resistance to Xanthomonas phaseoli (E. E Sm.) Dows, the bacterium that causes <b>common</b> <b>blight</b> of <b>beans</b> (Coyne and Schuster, 1973).

Highlighted examples of breeding in <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> using molecular markers reveal the role and success of MAS in gene pyramiding, rapidly deploying resistance genes via marker-assisted backcrossing, enabling simpler detection and selection of resistance genes in absence of the pathogen, and contributing to simplified breeding of complex traits by detection and indirect selection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) with major effects.

Cumulative mapping of disease resistance traits has revealed new resistance gene clusters while adding to others, and reinforces the co-location of QTL conditioning resistance with specific resistance genes and defense-related genes. Breeding for resistance to insect pests is updated for bean pod weevil (Apion), bruchid seed weevils, leafhopper, thrips, bean fly, and whitefly, including the use of arcelin proteins as selectable markers for resistance to bruchid seed weevils. Breeding for resistance to abiotic stresses concentrates on drought, low soil phosphorus, and improved symbiotic nitrogen fixation.

40|$|Background: <b>Common</b> {{bacterial}} <b>blight</b> is {{a devastating}} bacterial disease of <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris) caused by Xanthomonas citri pv. fuscans and Xanthomonas phaseoli pv. phaseoli. These phylogenetically distant strains {{are able to}} cause similar symptoms on <b>common</b> <b>bean,</b> suggesting that they have acquired common genetic determinants of adaptation to <b>common</b> <b>bean.</b> Transcription Activator-Like (TAL) effectors are bacterial type III effectors {{that are able to}} induce the expression of host genes to promote infection or resistance. Their capacity to bind to a specific host DNA sequence suggests that they are potential candidates for host adaption. Results: To study the diversity of tal genes from Xanthomonas strains responsible for <b>common</b> bacterial <b>blight</b> of <b>bean,</b> whole genome sequences of 17 strains representing the diversity of X. citri pv. fuscans and X. phaseoli pv. phaseoli were obtained by single molecule real time sequencing. Analysis of these genomes revealed the existence of four tal genes named tal 23 A, tal 20 F, tal 18 G and tal 18 H, respectively. While tal 20 F and tal 18 G were chromosomic, tal 23 A and tal 18 H were carried on plasmids and shared between phylogenetically distant strains, therefore suggesting recent horizontal transfers of these genes between X. citri pv. fuscans and X. phaseoli pv. phaseoli strains. Strikingly, tal 23 A was present in all strains studied, suggesting that it {{played an important role in}} adaptation to <b>common</b> <b>bean.</b> In silico predictions of TAL effectors targets in the <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> genome suggested that TAL effectors shared by X. citri pv. fuscans and X. phaseoli pv. phaseoli strains target the promoters of genes of similar functions. This could be a trace of convergent evolution among TAL effectors from different phylogenetic groups, and comforts the hypothesis that TAL effectors have been implied in the adaptation to <b>common</b> <b>bean.</b> Conclusions: Altogether, our results favour a model where plasmidic TAL effectors are able to contribute to host adaptation by being horizontally transferred between distant lineages...|$|R
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>beans</b> in {{moderate}} temperature {{regions are}} victims of halo blights. Main hosts are lima beans, red kidney bean, cranberry yellow eye field beans, snap beans, scarlet runner, kudzu vine and <b>common</b> P.vulgaris. Halo <b>blight</b> is affected by environment factors and enter through plant injuries or natural openings. The development of the Halo blight is highly favored by cool temperature (such as 20-23°C), unlike other <b>common</b> bacterial <b>blights.</b> In warm temperatures (over 24 °C), the production of phaseolotoxin decreases and symptoms become less obvious. Phaseolotoxin is a toxin produced by Halo blight pathogen which causes systemic chlorosis. Halo blight causes small water-soaked spots on leaves. These spot progressively turn dark brown and are surrounded by a wide greenish yellow halo. The necrotic spots remain small unlike that of <b>common</b> <b>blight.</b> Similar to foliage symptoms, halo blights causes water-soaked spots on vegetative pods. It also causes streaks along pod sutures. If lesions becomes severe on the pods, it may penetrate the pod walls or expand into the pod sutures which causes the seed to be wrinkled and discolored (yellow patches on the seed coat). Systemic infections are not common, but occur more favorably in some dry bean varieties. If the disease develops a systemic infection, it will cause curling, yellowing and death of young leaflets.|$|R

The genome sequence of the <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) provides valuable data for determining the genomic organization of NBS-LRR genes. However, data on the NBS-LRR genes in the <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> are limited. In total, 178 NBS-LRR-type genes and 145 partial genes (with or without a NBS) located on 11 <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> chromosomes were identified from genome sequences database. Furthermore, 30 NBS-LRR genes were classified into Toll/interleukin- 1 receptor (TIR) -NBS-LRR (TNL) types, and 148 NBS-LRR genes were classified into coiled-coil (CC) -NBS-LRR (CNL) types. Moreover, the phylogenetic tree supported the division of these PvNBS genes into two obvious groups, TNL types and CNL types. We also built expression profiles of NBS genes in response to anthracnose and <b>common</b> bacterial <b>blight</b> using qRT-PCR. Finally, we detected nine disease resistance loci for anthracnose (ANT) and seven for <b>common</b> bacterial <b>blight</b> (CBB) using the developed NBS-SSR markers. Among these loci, NSSR 24, NSSR 73, and NSSR 265 may be located at new regions for ANT resistance, while NSSR 65 and NSSR 260 may be located at new regions for CBB resistance. Furthermore, we validated NSSR 24, NSSR 65, NSSR 73, NSSR 260, and NSSR 265 using a new natural population.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the resistance of 58 <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> lines against <b>common</b> bacterial <b>blight</b> (Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli) and bacterial wilt (Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens). The experimental design consisted of completely randomized blocks, with four replications per pathogen. The results were subjected to variance analysis by the F test at 1 % probability. Significant differences between the treatments indicated different resistance levels among the lines against both pathogens. According to the Scott-Knott test, six lines were resistant to Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli, 14 moderately resistant, and 38 susceptible. To Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens, 11 lines were resistant, 26 moderately resistant and 21 susceptible. Among these, the lines Pr 10 - 3 - 4 / 1, Pr 10 - 5 - 2 / 1 and Pr 10 - 5 - 2 / 2 of the black bean group and C 10 - 2 - 4 / 2 of the Carioca group were resistant to both major bacterial diseases affecting <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> in Brazil...|$|R
40|$|A {{periodic}} {{comparison of}} cultivars {{is essential to}} assess selection gains, determine deficiencies, define objectives, and set breeding priorities. Our objective {{was to assess the}} progress, or lack thereof, achieved in improving yield, plant type, maturity, and resistance to major bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases of dry bean of the western USA from 1918 to 1998. Twentyfive great northern, pink, pinto, and red cultivars were evaluated for seed yield at three locations in Idaho and for anthracnose, <b>Bean</b> <b>common</b> mosaic virus, <b>Bean</b> <b>common</b> mosaic necrosis virus, common and halo bacterial blights, Fusarium and Rhizoctonia root rots, Fusarium wilt, and white mold in Colorado, Idaho, and Washingto...|$|R

Similarly the AE-N of <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> showed direct and positive relationship with nodule dry eight <b>common</b> <b>beans,</b> indicating {{the importance of}} nodulation and the consecutive output of this biological process on to improve efficient utilization of applied mineral N fertilizer. Accordingly, the starter amount of N fertilizer is recommended for all experimental sites to get the highest AE-N of <b>common</b> <b>bean.</b> Beside this, the soil inherent soil fertility status and indigenous rhizobia nodulating <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> affects effectiveness of sole application of N fertilizer and in combination with Rhizobium inoculation on the productivity of <b>common</b> <b>bean.</b> Rhizobium inoculation reduced the need of exogenous N application to get maximum <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> yield in the study sites.|$|R
40|$|Field {{reaction}} of 25 red mottled bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) genotypes to <b>common</b> bacterial <b>blight</b> [Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli (Smith) Dye] was evaluated in Puerto Rico over 2 years. The average disease severity (percent leaf area with symptoms) was similar over years. The determinate red mottled genotypes had {{almost twice as}} much disease as indeterminate genotypes. Eight of the indeterminate genotypes had significantly less disease than {{the mean of the}} field experiments. These genotypes may serve as useful sources of resistance to <b>common</b> bacterial <b>blight.</b> The size of the chlorotic zone around necrotic lesions varied between growing seasons, showing that environment can influence the expression of <b>common</b> bacterial <b>blight</b> symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Polyclonal {{antisera}} {{were raised}} against isolates of <b>bean</b> <b>common</b> mosaic virus (BCMV) and <b>bean</b> <b>common</b> mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV) using conventional serological methods. Infected tissues containing, respectively, 22 recognized BCMV and BCMNV isolates were tested against the two antisera by antigen-coated plate (ACP) ELISA and double antibody sandwich (DAS) ELISA. Results indicated that each immunoglobulin was virus-specific by DAS-ELISA, providing {{clear distinction between}} BCMV and BCMNV. A reverse transcription, polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) -based assay in combination with restriction endonuclease analyses, was developed for molecular detection of BCMV, BCMNV and their pathogroups. Specific detection of the two viruses was accomplished by constructing two virus-specific primer pairs that amplified a PCR product specific for each virus...|$|R
40|$|In the {{agricultural}} region near Kununurra in the Kimberly region of Western Australia, <b>Bean</b> <b>common</b> mosaic virus (BCMV; genus potyvirus) was found infecting wild Macroptilium atropurpureum (purple bush bean, siratro) and Phaseolus vulgaris (borlotti <b>bean,</b> <b>common</b> <b>bean).</b> Whole genome sequencing of BCMV from M. atropurpureum was undertaken {{to provide the}} first full length sequence for this virus from Australia. Amplified PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The genomic sequence (10054 bp) obtained was submitted to GenBank (Accession EU 761198). This sequence {{and those of other}} BCMV sequences already on GenBank, were used to construct phylogenetic trees of (i) full length genomes (nucleotides), and (ii) coat protein (CP) sequences (amino acids). The results from the genomic and CP analyses indicate that the Australian BCMV isolate studied is closely related to BCMV isolates previously reported from the American continent...|$|R
40|$|Necrotic {{strains of}} <b>bean</b> <b>common</b> mosaic potyviruses are {{becoming}} increasingly problematic in bean growing areas of Africa and Europe. Pyramiding epistatic resistance genes provides the most effective long-term strategy for disease control against all known strains of the virus. Indirect selection using tightly linked markers should facilitate the breeding of desired epistatic resistance gene combinations. In <b>common</b> <b>bean,</b> the most effective strategy for broad spectrum control of the <b>bean</b> <b>common</b> mosaic potyviruses is to combine I and bc- 3 genes. We describe the use of near-isogenic lines and segregating populations from different gene pools combined with bulked segregant analysis to identify markers tightly linked with the recessive bc- 3 gene that conditions resistance to all strains of <b>bean</b> <b>common</b> mosaic necrosis virus. We identified a RAPD marker, OG 6595, linked at 3. 7 cM from the bc- 3, and the marker was used to confirm the location of bc- 3 gene on bean linkage group B 6. A codominant AFLP marker, EACAMCGG- 169 / 172 was identified and linked at 3. 5 cM from the bc- 3 and the AFLP and OG 6595 markers flanked the bc- 3 gene. The AFLP marker was converted to the STS marker SEACAMCGG- 134 / 137 which showed co-segregation with the original AFLP marker. The 134 bp fragment associated with resistance was linked with the bc- 3 gene present in {{a diverse group of}} bean genotypes except in two kidney bean lines. The OG 6595 marker mapped on B 6 supported independence of bc- 3 from the I gene located on B 2, which provides the opportunity to readily combine both genes in a single bean cultivar for broad spectrum resistance to <b>bean</b> <b>common</b> mosaic potyviruses...|$|R
