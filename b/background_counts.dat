50|$|At pulsed muon sources protons {{hitting the}} {{production}} target are bunched into short, intense and widely separated pulses, {{that provide a}} similar time structure in the secondary muon beam. An advantage of pulsed muon sources is that the event rate is only limited by detectors construction. Furthermore, detectors are active only after the incoming muon pulse, strongly reducing the accidental <b>background</b> <b>counts.</b> The virtual absence of background allows {{the extension of the}} time window for measurements up to about ten times the muon mean lifetime. The reverse of the medal is that the width of the muon pulse limits the time resolution.ISIS and J-PARC are the two pulsed muon sources available for µSR experiments.|$|E

Adding secondary fluor to the solvent, to shorten the pulses from sample decay events, helps the effectively separate these from the slow glass fluorescences. The power of this method in improving counting performance was examined for: 14 C in benzene in normal and low background environments using the Wallac low-level liquid scintillation counter, 1220 QuantulusTM, with an active anticoincidence guard detector. The primary fluor was 15 mg/mL butyl-PBD, and the secondary fluor was 1 mg/mL bis-MSB, 3 H in aqueous solution with commercial cocktails.

Primary findings of the investigation include the following: (a) Much of the lead at the INEL was obtained from a DOE lead bank; (b) Lead inventory at the DOE lead bank was derived primarily from recycled sources and was most likely in the form of pure lead; (c) Secondary lead (lead from recycled sources), available in today`s market, is expected to have radiological characteristics {{similar to those of the}} DOE lead bank; (d) Highly sensitive radiological testing of 20 samples of lead from secondary sources revealed the lead to be radiologically pristine. Beta-, gamma-, and alpha-emitting radionuclide concentrations were all found to be less than detectable, except for a very small quantity of lead- 210 (an alpha emitter), which is a naturally occurring isotope of lead. Based on the pristine nature of lead, a proposed free release criterion for lead was developed based on a statistical null hypothesis approach. The free release criterion compares the natural <b>background</b> <b>count</b> of a clean lead standard with the natural <b>background</b> <b>count</b> of a sample.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{statistical}} analysis {{was to investigate the}} magnitudes of the components of variance of the calibration factor and to assess their impact on calibration factor variability. To do this, we used a statistical methodology that models the relationship between explanatory variables (such as SEF, radionuclide activity meter constancy, and <b>background</b> <b>count</b> rate) and dependent variables (such as CFrA and CFdA). Similarly, we studied the influence of SEF and <b>background</b> <b>count</b> rate on the measured calibration source count rate, as well as the impact of SEF on the <b>background</b> <b>count</b> rate. We used a mixed-effects model [14] where some explanatory variables were modeled as fixed effects and some as random effects. A fixed effect is one where there is a functional relationship between the explanatory variable and quantity of interest; in this work, we assumed the relationship to be linear. For example, we assumed that there was a linear relationship between the camera sensitivity factor and the calibration factor for reasons described below. A random effect is one where the contribution from that variable for a particular measurement is a sample of a random variable; in this work, all the random variables were assumed to have zero-mean normal distributions with unknown variances.|$|R
