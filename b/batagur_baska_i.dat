25|$|The Sundarbans National Park houses an {{excellent}} number of reptiles as well. Some common ones are olive ridley turtles, sea snakes, dog-faced water snakes, green turtles, estuarine crocodiles, chameleons, king cobras, Russell's vipers, house geckos, monitor lizards, hawksbill turtles, pythons, common kraits, green vine snake, checkered keelbacks and rat snakes. The river terrapin (<b>Batagur</b> <b>baska),</b> Indian flap-shelled turtles (Lissemys punctata), peacock soft-shelled turtles (Trionyx hurum), yellow monitors (Varanus flavescens), Asian water monitors (Varanus salvator), and Indian pythons (Python molurus) are some resident species.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} mammals {{include a}} small group of wild Asian elephants in Rakhine State, while once common species of mammals and reptiles such as the tiger, the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) and the mangrove terrapin (<b>Batagur</b> <b>baska)</b> have either disappeared or seriously reduced in number Bird life however is much richer including waterbirds such as Oriental darter (Anhinga melanogaster), little cormorant (Phalacrocorax nigers), Pacific reef heron (Egretta sacra), great-billed heron (Ardea sumatrana), ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea), bronze-winged jacana (Metopidius indicus), lesser sand plover (Charadrius mongolus), beach stone-curlew (Esacus magnirostris), black-winged stilt (Himantopus himantopus), Nordmann's greenshank (Tringa guttifer), lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus) and common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus).|$|R
25|$|The {{endangered}} species that {{live within the}} Sundarbans and extinct species {{that used to be}} include the royal Bengal tigers, estuarine crocodile, northern river terrapins (<b>Batagur</b> <b>baska),</b> olive ridley sea turtles, Gangetic dolphin, ground turtles, hawksbill sea turtles and king crabs (horse shoe). Some species such as hog deer (Axis porcinus), water buffalos (Bubalus bubalis), barasingha or swamp deer (Cervus duvauceli), Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus), single horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) and the mugger crocodiles or marsh crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris) started to become extinct in the Sundarbans towards the middle of the 20th century, because of extensive poaching and man hunting by the British. There are other threatened mammal species, such as the capped langurs (Semnopithecus pileatus), smooth-coated otters (Lutrogale perspicillata), Oriental small-clawed otters (Aonyx cinerea), and great Bengal civets (Viverra zibetha).|$|R
2500|$|There are 25 {{recorded}} {{species of}} reptiles in the Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area [...] with 4 species {{listed on the}} IUCN Red List as Vulnerable: the Southeast Asian Box Turtle (Cuora amboinensis); the Giant Asian Pond Turtle (Heosemys grandis); the Black Marsh Turtle (Siebenrockiella crassicollis) and the Southeast Asia Softshell Turtle (Amyda cartilaginea). Two species are currently listed as Endangered - the Yellow-headed Temple Turtle (Hieremys annandalii) and the Yellow-headed Tortoise (Indotestudo elongate), {{both of which are}} also listed on CITES due to trade exploitation. Populations of these species have declined in Thailand due to extensive habitat loss from land conversion into rice fields, rubber tree plantations and shrimp farms.

Further, we provide evidence that <b>Batagur</b> <b>baska</b> (Gray 1830) historically was dis-tributed from north-easternmost India and Bangladesh to at least the Ayeyarwady and Bago estuaries in Myanmar while B. affinis occurs in the southern Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. The taxonomic allocation of the extant and extirpated Batagur populations in the northern Malay Peninsula, Cambodia and southern Vietnam remains unclear. A museum specimen from the mid- 19 th century suggests that B. baska once also occurred in the Indus Delta of southern Pakistan...|$|R

25|$|In 2003, a 10-year {{program for}} the {{conservation}} of freshwater turtles and tortoises was initiated by the bank in collaboration with government forest departments from concerned states across India. In May 2004, the bank successfully bred one of the world's most critically endangered turtles, the Indian painted roof turtle, Batagur kachuga, {{for the first time ever}} in captivity. The species is protected under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 and is listed under the Action Plan Rating I of the IUCN/SSC Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group. The bank is home to another near endemic <b>Batagur</b> turtle, <b>Batagur</b> <b>baska.</b> Incidentally, recent evidence suggests that this species is extinct in the wild and only 13 individuals remain in captivity, including 4 adult females of which 2 are at the CrocBank. The bank sends 50% of its stock of the red-crowned roof turtle to the Uttar Pradesh forest department to introduce into the wild. In 2004, concerned parties created the Gharial Multi-Task Force (renamed to Gharial Conservation Alliance in 2008) to create a specialist organization dedicated to saving gharials from extinction.|$|R
