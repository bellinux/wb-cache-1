50|$|The {{lamp burner}} has a flat wick, usually made of cotton. The {{lower part of}} the wick dips into the fount and absorbs the kerosene; the top part of the wick extends out of the wick tube of the lamp burner, which {{includes}} a wick-adjustment mechanism. Adjusting how much of the wick extends above the wick tube controls the flame. The wick tube surrounds the wick, and ensures that the correct amount of air reaches the lamp <b>burner.</b> <b>Adjustment</b> is usually done by means of a small knob operating a cric, which is a toothed, metal sprocket bearing against the wick. If the wick is too high, and extends beyond the burner cone {{at the top of the}} wick tube, the lamp will produce smoke and soot (unburned carbon). When the lamp is lit, the kerosene that the wick has absorbed burns and produces a clear, bright, yellow flame. As the kerosene burns, capillary action in the wick draws more kerosene up from the fuel tank. All kerosene flat wick lamps use the dead flame burner design, where the flame is fed cold air from below and hot air exits above.|$|E
40|$|Hot mix asphalt {{industries}} {{are required to}} meet airborne emissions thresholds, yet only a few types of emission measurements are available. This study is therefore aimed at evaluating the influence of operating parameters on airborne emissions at the plant stack, especially Gaseous Organic Compounds (GOC), in addition to identifying both the best mixing conditions and bitumen influence through laboratory testing. Emission measurements have been performed for a given set of production conditions, and results highlight significant changes in emission flows. COz, S 02 ' NOx and GOC all seem to be correlated with combustion intensity and energy consumption, whereas CO tends instead {{to be associated with}} combustion efficiency. Laboratory GOC variations exhibit monotonic increases with temperature; at the plant level, these effects are concealed by combustion scatlering due to <b>burner</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Flow assessment is provided at the plant for each pollutant along with its dispersion...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is to reveal the {{mechanisms}} of corrosion processes of outer surfaces of low-emission steam boiler evaporator tubes. Examinations were performed to find the reasons of different corrosion susceptibility of tubes situated at combustion chamber on various levels. Design/methodology/approach: Examinations were conducted on several segments of Ø 57 x 5. 0 mm evaporator tubes made of 16 M (16 Mo 3) steel grade. Segments were taken from level of 10 meters and 18 meters from the chamber bottom of low-emission coal fired steam boiler after two years operation. Microstructure degradation of base material was estimated. Metallographic evaluation of scale morphology, its micro sites chemical composition analysis and distribution of elements on cross sections have been performed. Findings: Eexaminations of evaporator tubes indicated that reduction of wall thickness was considerable at the segments taken from level of 10 m, when at level of 18 m this reduction was small. The morphology of scales consisted of external layer which was porous and weakly connected to the tube surface, and internal layer, which was dense and adherent to the base metal. In these two layers the bands reach in sulfur were detected. The sulfide corrosion seems to be the main degradation mechanism of the tube surface at the level of 10 m. Research limitations/implications: Corrosion of the water wall tubes in low-emission steam boilers is a result of reaction of steel tube surface with the aggressive substoichiometric environment contains sulfur. The chemical composition of flue gases changes along the water wall. The exact compound of flue gases has not been determined in this study. Practical implications: Prevention of water wall tubes corrosion can be achieved by changing in operation conditions or replacement of tube materials. The first mentioned action is limited to accurate <b>burner’s</b> <b>adjustment</b> or introduces a flow of additional air along the walls and create air curtain between reducing environment and tubes surface. These efforts often are insufficient. The replacement of more corrosion resistant material on Cr rich steel or Cr-Ni steel is possible but other problems appear connected with high costs of installation and low heat transfer coefficients of such materials. Knowing the mechanisms of corrosion allows adjusting combustion process at low emission steam boilers. Originality/value: Information available in literature does not clearly indicate what mechanism of corrosion is dominant at different parts of combustion chamber. The current study shows which corrosion mechanisms are the most dangerous for evaporator tubes...|$|R
40|$|The burning {{characteristics}} {{of natural gas}} and the determination of its inter-changeability with liquefied petroleum gas on domestic burners are presented in this paper. Earlier studies had sought the correlation of heating values with specific gravities {{as a basis for}} determining the interchangeability of the gas. In this study, it is established that, additionally burning characteristics, which depend on chemical composition, must also be included to accurately predict the range of interchangeability achievable in a given situation. The Wobbe Number, combustion potential and yellow tip index are calculated for both liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and various compositions representative of associated low-pressure and non-association high pressure natural gas. These were then graphically presented as area enclosed by lines representing limits of flash back, lifting and incomplete combustion. It is found that natural gas can be interchanged with LPG as substitute gas for domestic <b>burners,</b> without <b>adjustment</b> of the <b>burner</b> nozzle. The necessary condition for this is that the quality of combustion for the associated natural gas is enhanced when it is fed into the burner above the hydrocarbon and water dew points of the gas, and at twice the pressure at which bottled liquefied petroleum gas is usually supplied to the burners...|$|R
40|$|The global {{increase}} in natural gas (NG) consumption and its steady decline in availability have spurred {{the search for}} new or alternative energy sources, such as pyrolysis gases. This article examines whether {{it is possible to}} burn pyrolysis gases from common plastic wastes in conventional <b>burners</b> without any <b>adjustment</b> to <b>burner</b> design. To determine the interchangeability of individual gases, several multiindex methods applicable to combustion devices in Europe, the USA, and the UK were used. This report is a continuation of a previous article (Part I) discussing the results of graphical methods for determining interchangeability. Similar to Part I, the results here imply that poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) gases produced at a minimum of 700 C have the highest replacement potential, and gases produced by polystyrene (PS) pyrolysis at 900 C also conform with replacement requirements. For plastics mixtures, gases generated by pyrolysis at a minimum of 700 C would be suitable alternatives to NG. These findings may contribute to plastic waste reduction as well as the discussion of reducing NG consumption. There is significant potential for follow-up research in this area, because the replacement of conventional fuels with gases obtained from wastes has not yet been sufficiently explored.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to assess the}} feasibility of a photodiode to control combustion, instead of a spectrometer (which is an expensive sensor to be used in commercial burners). For that purpose, the flame emission has been measured in a hot-water boiler fired with light fuel-oil, whose nominal output power goes up to 370 kW. The parameters investigated were: overall air excess, combustion air distribution, burner power and atmospheric conditions. High influence of air distribution on the flame emission was detected by the diode, since it modifies directly the mixing quality reducing rich-fuel regions where soot can be formed. Low influence of air excess and burner power was found. When these parameters increase, the flame emission decreases. This behavior is explained by the better mixing attained at high burner power and at high air excess. However the high emission level observed at low firing rate can be reduced with a good <b>burner</b> <b>adjustment.</b> With the photodiode, it was possible to find the optimum air excess value where NO, CO and soot are as low as possible. As the photodiode measures locally in the flame, results were compared with images obtained with a CCD camera. Finally, these results are in good agreement with those obtained previously with the spectrometer...|$|E
40|$|General Electric (GE) has {{developed}} an approach whereby native mercury reduction on fly ash can be improved by optimizing the combustion system. This approach eliminates carbon-rich areas in the combustion zone, making the combustion process more uniform, and allows increasing carbon content in fly ash without significant increase in CO emissions. Since boiler excess O{sub 2 } can be also reduced {{as a result of}} optimized combustion, this process reduces NO{sub x} emissions. Because combustion optimization improves native mercury reduction on fly ash, it can reduce requirements for activated carbon injection (ACI) when integrated with sorbent injection for more efficient mercury control. The approach can be tailored to specific unit configurations and coal types for optimal performance. This report describes results of a U. S. DOE sponsored project designed to evaluate the effect of combustion conditions on 'native' mercury capture on fly ash and integrate combustion optimization for improved mercury and NO{sub x} reduction with ACI. The technology evaluation took place in Lee Station Unit 3 located in Goldsboro, NC and operated by Progress Energy. Unit 3 burns a low-sulfur Eastern bituminous coal and is a 250 MW opposed-wall fired unit equipped with an ESP with a specific collection area of 249 ft{sup 2 }/kacfm. Unit 3 is equipped with SO{sub 3 } injection for ESP conditioning. The technical goal of the project was to evaluate the technology's ability to achieve 70 % mercury reduction below the baseline emission value of 2. 9 lb/TBtu, which was equivalent to 80 % mercury reduction relative to the mercury concentration in the coal. The strategy to achieve the 70 % incremental improvement in mercury removal in Unit 3 was (1) to enhance 'naturally' occurring fly ash mercury capture by optimizing the combustion process and using duct humidification to reduce flue gas temperatures at the ESP inlet, and (2) to use ACI in front of the ESP to further reduce mercury emissions. The program was comprised of field and pilot-scale tests, engineering studies and consisted of eight tasks. As part of the program, GE conducted pilot-scale evaluation of sorbent effect on mercury reduction, supplied and installed adjustable riffle boxes to assist in combustion optimization, performed combustion optimization, supplied mobile sorbent injection and flue gas humidification systems, conducted CFD modeling of sorbent injection and flue gas humidification, and performed mercury testing including a continuous 30 -day sorbent injection trial. Combustion optimization was the first step in reduction of mercury emissions. Goals of combustion optimization activities were to improve 'native' mercury capture on fly ash and reduce NO{sub x}. Combustion optimization included balancing of coal flow through individual burners to eliminate zones of carbon-rich combustion, air flow balancing, and <b>burner</b> <b>adjustments.</b> As part of the project, the original riffle boxes were replaced with Foster-Wheeler's adjustable riffle boxes to allow for biasing the coal flow between the coal pipes. A 10 -point CO/O{sub 2 }/NO{sub x} grid was installed in the primary superheater region of the back pass to assist in these activities. Testing of mercury emissions before and after combustion optimization demonstrated that mercury emissions were reduced from 2. 9 lb/TBtu to 1. 8 lb/TBtu due to boiler operation differences in conjunction with combustion optimization, a 38 % improvement in 'native' mercury capture on fly ash. Native mercury reduction from coal was {approx} 42 % at baseline conditions and 64 % at optimized combustion conditions. As a result of combustion optimization NO{sub x} emissions were reduced by 18 %. A three-dimensional CFD model was developed to study the flow distribution and sorbent injection in the post air heater duct in Lee Station Unit 3. Modeling of the flow pattern exiting the air pre-heater demonstrated that because of the duct transition from a circular opening at the exit of air-pre-heater to a rectangular ESP inlet duct, flow separation occurred at the corners after the transition. Modeling also demonstrated that the flow was severely biased from the South side to the North side due to the bend of the duct. Results of CFD modeling were used to design lances for better sorbent distribution across the ESP inlet duct. Modeling of water injection demonstrated that because of flue gas temperature biasing, the droplet evaporation rate was slower on the North side than that on the South side of the duct. Modeling suggested that an improvement of water droplet evaporation could be achieved by closing the lance on the North side where flue gas temperatures were lower. Preliminary evaluation of the effect of carbon-based sorbents on mercury reduction took place in a 1 MBtu/hr (300 kW) Boiler Simulator Facility using the same coal as fired at Lee Station...|$|R
