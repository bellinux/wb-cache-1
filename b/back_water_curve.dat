Ministry of water {{resources}} and irrigation is interested in studying the development and evolution of these islands in order to reflect the esthetic aspects and {{improvement of the environment}} surrounding the islands. This study focuses on Shubra El-Khaima Island which is located upstream Delta Barrage in the <b>back</b> <b>water</b> <b>curve</b> region. The study aims to propose different alternatives for island development. GSTAR 3. 0 model is the most recent version of a series of numerical models for simulating flow of water and sediment transport and prediction of morphological changes in alluvial rivers. This model was used to simulate and examine different alternatives for Shubra island development on river morphology according to different discharges scenarios. The optimum alternative was proposed. Also, the future required precautions to mitigate the effects of this development on the stability of watercourse were suggested...|$|E

30|$|Based {{on the new}} {{formula of}} K ro/K rw and S w at ultra-high water cut stage, the new <b>water</b> drive <b>curve</b> was derived with the {{reservoir}} engineering method. The new <b>water</b> drive <b>curve</b> is transformed to the conventional one when n =  1. Comparison of prediction with new <b>water</b> drive <b>curve,</b> conventional one, and methods in references 27 and 28 was done with numerical simulation and field application in two oilfields, which showed that the new <b>water</b> drive <b>curve</b> could fit the development data both at the high water cut and at the ultra-high water cut stage and characterize the upwarping trend at ultra-high water cut stage. The new <b>water</b> drive <b>curve</b> at ultra-high <b>water</b> cut predicts the water-flooded recoverable reserve and water cut more accurately than other <b>water</b> drive <b>curves</b> and has better adaptability.|$|R

30|$|As a {{reservoir}} engineering method for prediction of development index and recoverable reserve, and dynamic {{analysis in the}} water-flooded reservoir, the <b>water</b> drive <b>curves</b> play {{important role in the}} oilfield development (Chen and Li 2001; Bondar and Blasingame 2002). Since Maкcимoв (1959) from the former Soviet Union firstly put forward the <b>water</b> drive <b>curve</b> in 1959, a lot of effort has been done worldwide in the research on the <b>water</b> drive <b>curve,</b> e.g. Haзapoв (1972) proposed type D <b>water</b> drive <b>curve</b> in 1972, Tong (1978) introduced the <b>water</b> drive <b>curve</b> proposed by Maкcимoв to China and named it as type A <b>water</b> drive <b>curve</b> in 1978, Caзoнoв (1973) and Tong (1981) conducted research on type B <b>water</b> drive <b>curve</b> and popularized it in the oilfield development, and Cилaчeв (1981) and Haзapoв (1982) proposed type C <b>water</b> drive <b>curve.</b> The researchers in China introduced the curves and conducted the theoretical extension and field application (Tong 1989). Chen (1985, 1993, 1994, 1995, 2000) and Yu and Jin (1995), Yu (1999 a, 2000) completed theoretical derivation of formulas for type A, B, C, D, and other <b>water</b> drive <b>curves</b> based on oil–water flow in the porous medium. Zhang (1998) completed derivation of <b>water</b> drive <b>curve</b> that is applied widely in the oilfields. Gao and Xu (2007) also conducted theoretical research based on the ratio of oil and water flow in the porous medium. After decades of development, there are more than 50 types of <b>water</b> drive <b>curves</b> (Yu 2000), among which the conventional <b>water</b> drive <b>curves,</b> i.e. type A, B, C, and D ones, are most used in the oilfield development and chosen as four methods in the standard of China’s oil and gas industry (Yu et al. 1999 b). The above four methods were derived theoretically based on the rule of flow in the semi-log linear relation between the ratio of oil and water relative permeability and the water saturation in the oil–water relative permeability curves (Chen 2002; Can and Kabir 2014). Field application showed that the linear relation is applicable in the oilfields at medium–high water cut stage. For the oilfields at ultra-high water cut stage, the rule of fluid flow in the formation has been changed fundamentally, and the ratio of oil and water permeability and the water saturation deviate from the linear relationship in the semi-log curve, showing the downwarping trend with nonlinear relation. Correspondingly, the conventional <b>water</b> drive <b>curves</b> are upwarping at ultra-high water cut stage without linear relationship. Thus, the conventional <b>water</b> drive <b>curves</b> are not applicable in the oilfields at ultra-high water cut stage (Chen and Tao 1997). The conventional <b>water</b> drive <b>curves</b> would result in higher recoverable reserve and recovery, creating the big error. Currently, there are few reports about the new formula of the relation between the ratio of oil and water permeability and the water saturation in oilfields at ultra-high water cut stage. Only Liu et al. (2011), Wang et al. (2013), Song et al. (2013), and Cui et al. (2015) in China proposed the exponential and binomial equations for the relation between the ratio of oil and water permeability and the water saturation, completed derivation of exponential, binomial, and inverse-proportion <b>water</b> drive <b>curves,</b> which have some limitations in prediction accuracy. Thus, it needs more effort to work out the <b>water</b> drive <b>curve</b> for the oilfields at ultra-high water cut stage. This paper aims at establishing the new formula of the relation between the ratio of oil and water permeability and the water saturation, based on which the new <b>water</b> drive <b>curve</b> is obtained. The numerical and field application confirmed the applicability of the new <b>water</b> drive <b>curve</b> in prediction of development index, recoverable reserve, and recovery, which is of significance to improvement of evaluation methods of oilfields at ultra-high water cut stage.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{deals with}} the {{application}} of the filter paper method to determine <b>water</b> retention <b>curves</b> for mortar and concrete samples. A <b>water</b> retention <b>curve</b> exhibits the relationship between water content and energy state in interstitial water, normally expressed as a negative value when compare to normal conditions of temperature and pressure, being referred to as suction. Considering the <b>water</b> retention <b>curve</b> as a basic characterization tool for unsaturated soils, its usage in the engineering field concerning most of the construction materials remains as a pending task. However, stating that not only permeability, but also the <b>water</b> retention <b>curve</b> performs a significant role for water and soluble substances flow through a material's pores makes this observation essential for life-span estimation in cases like reinforced-concrete structures. This research paper offers results for <b>water</b> retention <b>curves</b> obtained in mortar and concrete samples. The experimental curves went through a fitting adjustment process using Van Genutchen's [1] model, showing consistency with the obtained results. Furthermore, the water/cement mix ratio does not indicate or suggest a direct influence for <b>water</b> retention <b>curves...</b>|$|R
