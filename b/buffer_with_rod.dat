40|$|In-line {{monitoring}} of die-casting of aluminum (A 356, A 357, 86 S), magnesium (AZ 91) and a {{metal matrix composite}} (Gra-NiRTM 6 S: 3 G) will be monitored using the reflection coefficient obtained by using an ultrasonic technique, the pulse/echo. For each of the materials enumerated above, the average temperature of the mold through its thickness, the end of filling of the part, the solidification of the part in the cavity of the mold, the gap and/or the detachment of the part, the sound velocity and the attenuation of the material will be measured by this ultrasonic technique during the process. For the materials the melt temperature will not exceed 600 °C because the casting is made at the semi-solid state, between the solidus and liquidus, of the materials. A novel high performance <b>buffer</b> <b>rod</b> <b>with</b> a cooling system is integrated into the die. Therefore, ultrasonic measurements {{can be carried out}} with high signal-to-noise ratio at elevated temperatures...|$|R
30|$|Ultrasonic {{velocity}} {{measurements were}} performed using the pulse reflection technique <b>with</b> <b>buffer</b> <b>rod.</b> To generate elastic waves, sinusoidal electric burst signals were produced by an arbitrary waveform generator (Tektronix AWG 2021, Beaverton, OR, USA) {{and applied to}} the LiNbO 3 piezoelectric transducer (10 ° Y-cut). The elastic waves of 8 MHz were transmitted through the buffer rod and the sample. The sample length was more than ten times longer than the wavelength of the elastic waves. Reflected elastic waves from {{the top and bottom}} surfaces of the sample were received by the transducer and then converted into an electric signal. The waveforms were recorded using a digital oscilloscope (Hewlett-Packard 54825 A, Palo Alto, CA, USA). These signals were sampled 4, 096 times for each run at a sample rate of 1.0 [*]×[*] 109 samples/s for a given P-T condition. We used the mean value of the recorded travel time for a given P-T condition and corresponding ray path to compute the average velocity. The maximum uncertainty in the measured V p values was ± 0.4 %. This procedure is described in more detail elsewhere (Kono et al. 2004).|$|R

30|$|CYE {{liquid medium}} {{was used for}} {{detecting}} the suitable buffer for CMCase production. The following <b>buffers</b> <b>with</b> their pH ranges were used for such a purpose, citrate <b>buffer</b> <b>with</b> pH range from 5.6 to 6.2, citrate phosphate <b>buffer</b> <b>with</b> pH range from 6 to 7 and phosphate <b>buffer</b> <b>with</b> pH range from 6 to 8. All these <b>buffers</b> <b>with</b> their different pH were prepared according to Collee et al. (1989). The constituents of the production medium were dissolved in the buffer solution and poured into the flask contained 50  mL of the buffered medium at the particular pH. The media were inoculated with 0.4  mL of a standardized bacterial inoculation. Then, the medium was incubated at 45  °C for 72  h. Extraction of the crude enzyme was carried out as mentioned above {{at the end of}} the incubation period and determined using colorimetric technique.|$|R
