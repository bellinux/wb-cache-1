Therefore, a computational method to analyze and optimize {{the performance of the}} blades needs to be developed. For that purpose, a computational method based on the <b>Blade</b> <b>Element</b> Momentum (BEM) <b>theory</b> is developed in the present study. In this method, the propeller blade is divided into several elements and it is assumed that there is no aerodynamic interaction amongst the elements. Furthermore, the equations from momentum and <b>blade</b> <b>element</b> <b>theories</b> are combined to obtain equations which are useful in blades design process. In the analysis, tip and root losses proposed by Prandtl are also implemented. The computation results are validated using Qblade software.

Taylor (1893) and Stefan Drzewiecki {{to determine the}} behavior of propellers. It involves breaking a blade down into several small parts then determining the forces {{on each of these}} small blade elements. These forces are then integrated along the entire blade and over one rotor revolution in order to obtain the forces and moments produced by the entire propeller or rotor. One of the key difficulties lies in modelling the induced velocity on the rotor disk. Because of this the <b>blade</b> <b>element</b> <b>theory</b> is often combined with the momentum theory to provide additional relationships necessary to describe the induced velocity on the rotor disk (for further details see Blade Element Momentum Theory). At the most basic level of approximation a uniform induced velocity on the disk is assumed: ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{development}} came in {{the form}} of Froude's <b>blade</b> <b>element</b> momentum <b>theory</b> (1878), later refined by Glauert (1926). Betz (1921) provided an approximate correction to momentum [...] "Rankine-Froude actuator-disk" [...] theory to account for the sudden rotation imparted to the flow by the actuator disk (NACA TN 83, [...] "The Theory of the Screw Propeller" [...] and NACA TM 491, [...] "Propeller Problems"). In <b>blade</b> <b>element</b> momentum <b>theory,</b> angular momentum is included in the model, meaning that the wake (the air after interaction with the rotor) has angular momentum. That is, the air begins to rotate about the z-axis immediately upon interaction with the rotor (see diagram below). Angular momentum must be taken into account since the rotor, which is the device that extracts the energy from the wind, is rotating as a result of the interaction with the wind.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the modeling {{of the performance}} of small propellers used for vertical takeoff and landing micro aerial vehicles operating at low Reynolds numbers and in oblique flow. The <b>blade</b> <b>element</b> momentum <b>theory,</b> vortex lattice method, and momentum theory for oblique flow are used to predict propeller performance. For validation, the predictions for a commonly used propeller for vertical takeoff and landing micro aerial vehicles are compared to a set of wind-tunnel experiments. Both the <b>blade</b> <b>element</b> momentum <b>theory</b> and vortex lattice method succeed in predicting correct trends of the forces and moments acting upon the propeller shaft, although accuracy decreases significantly in oblique flow. For the dataset analyzed here, combining the available data of the propeller in purely axial flow with the momentumtheory for oblique flow and applying a correction factor for the wake skew angle results in more accurate performance estimates at all elevation angles.

50|$|X-Plane differentiates {{itself from}} other {{simulators}} by implementing an aerodynamic model called <b>blade</b> <b>element</b> <b>theory.</b> Traditionally, flight simulators emulate the real-world performance of an aircraft by using empirical data in predefined lookup tables to determine aerodynamic forces such as lift or drag, which vary with differing flight conditions. These simulators sufficiently simulate the flight {{characteristics of the}} aircraft, specifically those with known aerodynamic data, but are not useful in design work, and do not predict the performance of aircraft when the actual figures are not available.|$|E
50|$|With <b>blade</b> <b>element</b> <b>theory,</b> {{a surface}} (e.g. wing) {{may be made}} up of many {{sections}} (1 to 4 is typical), and each section is further divided into as many as 10 separate subsections. After that, the lift and drag of each section are calculated, and the resulting effect is applied to the whole aircraft. When this process is applied to each component, the simulated aircraft will fly similar to its real-life counterpart. This approach allows users to design aircraft quickly and easily, as the simulator engine immediately illustrates how an aircraft with a given design might perform in the real world. X-Plane can model fairly complex aircraft designs, including helicopters, rockets, rotorcraft, and tilt-rotor craft.|$|E
50|$|Free vortex models (FVM) and Lagrangian {{particle}} vortex methods (LPVM) {{are both}} active {{areas of research}} that seek to increase modelling accuracy by accounting {{for more of the}} three-dimensional and unsteady flow effects than either BEM or RANS. FVM is similar to lifting line theory in that it assumes that the wind turbine rotor is shedding either a continuous vortex filament from the blade tips (and often the root), or a continuous vortex sheet from the blades' trailing edges. LPVM can use a variety of methods to introduce vorticity into the wake. Biot-Savart summation is used to determine the induced flow field of these wake vorticies' circulations, allowing for better approximations of the local flow over the rotor blades. These methods have largely confirmed much of the applicability of BEM and shed insight into the structure of wind turbine wakes. FVM has limitations due to its origin in potential flow theory, such as not explicitly modelling model viscous behavior (without semi-empirical core models), though LPVM is a fully viscous method. LPVM is more computationally intensive than either FVM or RANS, and FVM still relies on <b>blade</b> <b>element</b> <b>theory</b> for the blade forces.|$|E

Aerodynamic properties of various airfoils are determined, numerically, by using a software called FLUENT. <b>Blade</b> <b>element</b> momentum <b>theory</b> is applied to find chord lengths and twist angles for mean wind speed at 10 m height in Iztech campus area. Rotor performance is determined by using <b>blade</b> <b>element</b> momentum <b>theory.</b> Effects of twist angle and tip speed ratio are investigated for blade design. Rotor maximum power coefficient of the new designed blade is found as 0. 4313 while another design in use gives a maximum power coefficient of 0. 4044. It can be noted that new designed blade is more efficient, as it gives the maximum power coefficient at design conditions, 6. 85 m/s wind speed at 10 m height and 25 oC ambient temperature.

Based on these models, the calculation of energy consumption reduces to solving a minimization problem in two variables. As an application, we compare the energy consumption of different convertible structures in the horizontal-flight range of [0, 20]m/s.

40|$|Present work {{introduced}} the aerodynamics analysis of rotor blade helicopter in forward flight. The analysis used a combination between a Momentum Theory and The <b>Blade</b> <b>Element</b> <b>Theory.</b> Here the inflow ratio was assumed a uniform over the disk plane {{and it was}} predicted by using the momentum Theory. As the inflow ratio is available, then by using the <b>Blade</b> <b>element</b> <b>theory,</b> the aerodynamics loading along the blade span of the rotor are computed, which finally the thrust coefficient CT can be obtained. For a given a rotor blade configuration and flight condition, the Thrust coefficient CT is unknown, while the momentum theory required this value to be known in predicting the inflow ratio. As result an iteration process is required in implementing those two combined approaches. For the assessment purposes, four test cases had been studied. The difference between one case to other case had been selected in term: 1) twist distribution, 2) the presence of coning angle and 3) the required aerodynamics characteristics. The result showed {{that the combination of}} Momentum Theory and The <b>blade</b> <b>element</b> <b>theory</b> could provide a fast solution in predicting the aerodynamics performance of rotor blade helicopter. However a comparison result with the experiment result was required in order to asses the degree of accuracy of this approach. This was suggested as future work. ...|$|E
