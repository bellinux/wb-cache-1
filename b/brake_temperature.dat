40|$|Modern {{trains are}} {{equipped}} with different braking systems, between which the braking effort can be distributed. Among these, tread braking {{is still the most}} common system for friction braking. Tread brake systems are cheap and robust. However, extensive usage of tread brakes demands knowledge of operational limits to ensure safety and decrease life cycle costs (LCC) of the running gear. In the present work, a state-of-the-art literature survey has been compiled which covers topics related to establishing operational limits such as: brake control and blended <b>braking,</b> <b>braking</b> <b>temperatures,</b> <b>brake</b> block materials, wear and rolling contact fatigue of wheels due to tread braking, and capacity of tread brakes and brake discs. A methodology to simulate full-scale brake rig tests, including wheel-rail contact, has been further developed. It includes an axisymmetric thermal analysis, a 3 D mechanical wheel-rail contact analysis, and a 3 D thermomechanical analysis of the braked wheel. The behaviour of ER 7 grade railway wheel material is mimicked by use of a plasticity model calibrated against results from cyclic experiments on test specimens. The results from the simulations in terms of predicted fatigue lives show good agreement with full-scale test rig results for three combinations of initial velocity and brake block material. The developed methodology is employed in parametric studies. These consist of braking load cases characterised by operational parameters such as axle load, maximum vehicle speed, deceleration, block material, and initial wheel temperature. Damage evolution in the wheel tread is studied. A strong infuence of high temperatures on rolling contact fatigue formation in the wheel tread was observed. In particular, <b>braking</b> <b>temperatures</b> over 450 °C can result in a very short life up to crack initiation. However, for <b>braking</b> <b>temperatures</b> in the range of 300 - 350 °C, wheel tread material is more resistant to fatigue due to strain hardening...|$|R

40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{study of the}} properties of aircraft brake materials was made to determine ways of improving friction and wear behavior while minimizing surface temperatures. It is found that frictional variation at high temperature involves material softening and metal transfer, formation of oxides, and surface melting. The choice of proper materials to combat these effects is discussed. Minimum surface temperatures are found to result from use of materials with large density-specific heat and density-specific heat-conductivity factors, use of a higher load-lower friction system, and maximization of the contact area. Some useful trade-off criteria for the size of brake disks against weight considerations are suggested.

40|$|This project {{studies the}} {{operational}} and maintenance consequences that introduce {{the performance of}} fuel saving procedures during landing, specifically the use of idle reversal thrust and flap configuration 3. The topic of this study emerges due {{the implementation of the}} Airbus 319 aircrafts in Volotea fleet, and the need to assess the fuel saving procedures already studied for the Boeing 717 fleet. The use of the flap configuration 3, instead of the full configuration, increases the touchdown speed and the idle reverse thrust reduces the stopping force, in other words, a higher landing distance or a higher braking force will be needed to stop the aircraft. Firstly, were identified the consequences that both initiatives generate, and was given special importance to the brake wear. The brake wear depends mainly on temperature, being the worst region between 80 ºC and 250 ºC. In order to quantify the increase of the <b>brake</b> <b>temperature,</b> was analyzed real data taken from the four Airbus 319 that Volotea actually have.
