Ironically, the government's red zone declaration was ruled as unlawful by the High Court in August, 2013. Many roads remain damaged in Avondale as of 2014, posing a problem for residents, and the Avon river's banks had to be built up in the suburb to avoid flooding.

40|$|The {{inspiration}} {{for the title of}} my diploma I got from my work. I am employed at a construction company, were we work a lot with sewerage. I divided my diploma into two parts. The first part of diploma I started out with a description of the process before the actual construction of sewer is done, from site preparation, review of project documentation, to go see the construction site, time and operational plan, financial plan and cost estimation, elaborate work safety, the authorization and permissions for the construction works, street bars, to arrange construction sites. After describing the first part of my diploma I continued my work with the description of construction process. That is from preparation to the work, excavation for laying out the pipes to doing the dam and closing. The second part of diploma describes and explains assessment areas for the implementation of sewer lines. Thoroughly is made analysis of costs for various types of pipes made from different materials (concrete pipes, PVC pipes and tubes, polyester) to various slopes of excavation trench (45 °, 53 °, 70 °, 90 °). All the combinations were compared with different soil types. The purpose of my diploma was to compare the prices for <b>building</b> <b>sewer</b> which depends from its basis.
