The people here were of a {{slightly}} different class from those who had the entrée to the supper-room and were mostly crowded round the bar itself. At a small desk within {{a few feet of}} him a middle-aged woman with a cold, hard face sat with a <b>book</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> before her and a pile of bills. There was something almost Sphynx-like about her appearance. She never spoke. Her expression never changed. Once their eyes met. She looked at him steadfastly, but said nothing. The girl behind the bar also took note of him. She was very tall and slim, absolutely colorless, and with coils of fair hair drawn tightly back from her forehead. She was never without a cigarette, lighting a fresh one always from its predecessor, talking all the while unceasingly, but without the slightest change of expression. Once she waved the men and girls who stood talking to her on one side, and Duncombe fancied that it was because she desired a better view of him.|$|E
40|$|Each {{building}} or each project that is constructed nowadays is {{planned to be}} built as fast and cheap as possible. A large extent and considerable intensiveness of works bring about many problems during construction. In order to avoid them, numerous companies opt for preliminary project schedules that provide them with approximate duration of individual activities. One of the main problems of a project, which I analyse in my thesis, is time discrepancies of individual activities. I analysed this problem with the program Microsoft Project. This program enables planning of individual projects' duration. Using the program, I analysed and explained all time delays that had occurred during the analysed project. In addition to time delays, discrepancies in final prices of projects are also a frequent occurrence in the construction sector. These discrepancies mostly depend on “construction surprises” or additional works that become necessary and are added during the building phase. The price difference was compared {{on the basis of}} a contractual quotation and a <b>book</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> dimensions. I made an Excel file into which I entered all the data necessary for a subsequent calculation of the above-mentioned discrepancies. A project quotation for this type of analysis or price comparison is irrelevant as it is a mere project evaluation by designer...|$|E

With more detailed consideration of a question of charge of depreciation in developed with - temporary conditions, {{it is necessary to}} consider development of depreciation in the context of development of national schools of accounting.

The retrospective of concept and methods of charge of depreciation is represented, beginning from the XIV century worldwide. Various points of view on methods of charge of depreciation of such scientists, as V. Armuzzi, Zh. G. Kursel-Senel, Ya. V. Sokolov, Zh. B. Dyumarshe, D. S. Lewis, O. Shmalenbakh, A. P. Rudanovsky, A. K. Roshchakhovsky, etc. are considered. It is specified that the concept of depreciation was known to accountants of early Christian Rome. Gradually there was a change of approach to interpretation of the concept "depreciation". Within the French school allocated concept of broad and narrow depreciation, two options of a covering of depreciation expenses were offered, research of influence of fiscal policy on depreciation was conducted. The German school connected charge of depreciation with depreciation of property and need of formation of a sinking fund. Within maneuvers of Anglo-American school considered that depreciation has to be charged at the expense of profit in the sum only approximately equal to wear. Within domestic scientific thought, two main schools adhering to various opinions were allocated. For elaboration of uniform approach during the Soviet period in accounting there were accounts "Sinking fund", "Depreciation of fixed assets" that allowed to track a special-purpose character of use of a sinking fund.
