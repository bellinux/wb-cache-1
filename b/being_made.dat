5000|$|Ying Shao's (c. 195 CE) Fengsu Tongyi [...] "Common Meanings in Customs" [...] {{describes}} Han-era {{beliefs about}} the primeval goddess.People say that when Heaven and earth opened and unfolded, humankind did not yet exist, Nü Kua kneaded yellow earth and fashioned human beings. Though she worked feverishly, {{she did not have}} enough strength to finish her task, so she drew her cord in a furrow through the mud and lifted it out to make human beings. That is why rich aristocrats are the human <b>beings</b> <b>made</b> from yellow earth, while ordinary poor commoners are the human <b>beings</b> <b>made</b> from the cord's furrow. (Feng su f'ung-yi, CFCE 1.83, tr. Birrell 1993:35) Birrell (1993:34) identifies two worldwide mythic motifs in Ying Shao's account. Myths commonly say the first humans were created from clay, dirt, soil, or bone; Nügua used mud and yellow earth. Myths widely refer to social stratification; Nügua created the rich from yellow earth and the poor from mud. In contrast, the builder's cord motif is uniquely Chinese, and iconographic of the Goddess. In Han iconography, Nüwa sometimes holds a builder's compass.|$|R
