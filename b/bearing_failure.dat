25|$|For , Williams had {{the quickest}} and most {{reliable}} car, the FW18. Coulthard had left Williams to join Mika Häkkinen at McLaren, and Williams replaced him with Canadian Jacques Villeneuve, {{who had won}} the CART series title in 1995, while Hill remained with the team. Schumacher left Benetton to join Ferrari. Williams won the first five Grands Prix, Hill winning {{all but one of}} them. Olivier Panis would take victory at the sixth round in Monaco after both Williams cars retired. Hill would retire {{for the second time in}} a row after he spun-off in Spain, while his teammate, Villeneuve, took third place. Hill and Villeneuve dominated the next Grand Prix in Canada, with a 1–2 in qualifying and a 1–2 finish. Williams made it a second 1–2 after Hill won the French Grand Prix. Villeneuve won his second race in F1 at Silverstone after Hill retired with a wheel <b>bearing</b> <b>failure</b> on lap 26. Hill was victorious in the next Grand Prix in Germany while Villeneuve won the race after that in Hungary. Schumacher's Ferrari would then take the next two Grands Prix at Spa-Francorchamps and Monza. Villeneuve mounted a title challenge going into the final race of the season at Japan, but Hill reasserted his dominance to take the race and the 1996 title, while Villeneuve lost a wheel and retired.|$|E

This bridge had been proposed since the mid-1960s, and construction began in late 1972 at an estimated cost of £2m (£ million as of [...] ). An arch bridge had been the suggested design, but an asymmetrical N-truss bridge was built instead.

[...] The fuel system was not providing enough Jet A to the turbine {{to allow it}} to produce its full power output, meaning the car had to limp down the circuit's long straights. [...] While that car continued at a slowed pace, the other suffered a wheel <b>bearing</b> <b>failure</b> two hours later, requiring a lengthy three-hour repair.

500|$|Several {{in-flight}} shutdowns of Trent 700–powered A330-300s occurred. On 11 November 1996, {{engine failure}} on a Cathay Pacific flight forced {{it back to}} Ho Chi Minh City. On 17 April 1997, Cathay Pacific's subsidiary Dragonair experienced an engine shutdown on an A330, caused by carbon clogging the oil filter. As a result, Cathay Pacific self-suspended its 120-minute ETOPS clearance. [...] Another engine failure occurred on 6 May during climbout with a Cathay Pacific A330, due to a <b>bearing</b> <b>failure</b> in a Hispano-Suiza-built gearbox. Three days later, a Cathay Pacific A330 on climbout during a Bangkok–Hong Kong flight experienced an oil pressure drop and a resultant engine spool down, forcing a return to Bangkok. The cause was traced to metal contamination in the engine's master chip. Following a fifth engine failure on 23 May, Cathay Pacific and Dragonair voluntarily grounded their A330 fleets for two weeks, causing major disruption as Cathay's eleven A330s made up fifteen per cent of its passenger capacity. Rolls-Royce and Hispano-Suiza developed a redesigned lubrication system to resolve the problem.|$|E
500|$|... 1985 {{was a year}} {{in which}} Martini Racing needed to show the {{potential}} winning capabilities of the LC2 in order for Lancia to continue to fund a project that had seen limited success thus far. [...] The cars were further revised and were running on Michelin radial tyres. The season opened with an LC2 taking pole position at Mugello by 1.7 seconds ahead of the factory Porsche. [...] Although the pole position car's engine did not last, the other team car finished fourth. [...] For the 1000km of Monza, the LC2s were nearly four seconds ahead of the closest Porsche in qualifying, and led the race early on. [...] However, while Patrese and Nannini were in third place and on the same lap as the leaders, a tree fell across the track and caused the race to be stopped early. [...] On pole once again at Silverstone, one of the LC2s was in the lead of the race until a wheel <b>bearing</b> <b>failure</b> in the closing laps forced Nannini to pit, forfeiting the lead. [...] Although the LC2s did not take pole at Le Mans, they lead the race early. [...] Reliability issues again forced the team {{to drop out of the}} lead. [...] They eventually finished the race in sixth and seventh places. [...] A fuel pump failure also dropped the team out of contention at the Hockenheimring.|$|E
