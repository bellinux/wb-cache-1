40|$|Abstract. The super <b>brazed</b> {{diamond saw}} was {{developed}} to cut efficiently vehicle tyre in the research. The carbon film deposited diamond and the uncoated diamond were <b>brazed</b> with NiCr alloy by high-frequency induction heating under argon atmosphere at 1030 ℃ for 30 seconds respectively. The interfacial microstructures between the <b>brazed</b> diamond and the filler alloy were analyzed by the advanced testing technologies. The results shows that long-lath carbides with the definite orientation and better flatness are closely arrayed on the <b>brazed</b> uncoated diamond surface and Cr-carbides forms normally and compactly {{on the surface of}} carbon film deposited diamond <b>brazed.</b> That is because the carbon film has changed the mechanism of Cr-carbides forming on the surface of diamond <b>brazed.</b> The test of cutting vehicle tyre shows that the use life of the <b>brazed</b> deposited diamond saw is much longer than that of the <b>brazed</b> uncoated diamond saw...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} microgalvanic couple driven {{corrosion}} of <b>brazed</b> joints was investigated. 316 L stainless steel samples were joined using Cu-Ag-Ti and Cu-Ag-In-Ti <b>braze</b> alloys. Phase and elemental composition across each <b>braze</b> and parent metal interface was characterized and scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) {{was used to}} map the Volta potential differences. Co-localization of SKPFM with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) measurements enabled spatially resolved correlation of potential differences with composition and subsequent galvanic corrosion behavior. Following exposure to the aggressive solution, corrosion damage morphology was characterized to determine the mode of attack and likely initiation areas. When exposed to 0. 6 M NaCl, corrosion occurred at the braze- 316 L interface preceded by preferential dissolution of the Cu-rich phase within the <b>braze</b> alloy. <b>Braze</b> corrosion was driven by galvanic couples between the <b>braze</b> alloys and stainless steel {{as well as between}} different phases within the <b>braze</b> microstructure. Microgalvanic corrosion between phases of the <b>braze</b> alloys was investigated via SKPFM to determine how corrosion of the <b>brazed</b> joints developed...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{fatigue and}} {{oxidation}} {{data were obtained}} for 62 <b>brazed</b> specimens of 3 iron-, 3 nickel-, and 1 cobalt-base alloy. Fluidized bed thermal cycling was conducted over the range 740 / 25 C employing 10 cm long single-edge wedge specimens. Immersion time was always 4 minutes in each bed. Types of test specimens employed in the program include those with <b>brazed</b> overlays on the specimen radius, those butt <b>brazed</b> at midspan and those with a <b>brazed</b> foil overlay on the specimen radius. Of the 18 <b>braze</b> overlay specimens, 5 generated fatigue cracks by 7000 cycles. Thermal cracking of butt <b>brazed</b> specimens occurred exclusively through the butt <b>braze.</b> Of the 23 butt <b>brazed</b> specimens, 7 survived 11, 000 thermal cycles without cracking. Only 2 of the 21 foil overlaid specimens exhibiting cracking in 7, 000 cycles. Blistering of the foil did occur for 2 alloys by 500 cycles.

Lithium is often used in batteries, and lithium oxide can help process silica. Lithium stearate is a thickener {{and can be used}} to make lubricating greases; it is produced from lithium hydroxide, which is also used to absorb carbon dioxide in space capsules and submarines. Lithium chloride is used as a <b>brazing</b> alloy for aluminium parts. Metallic lithium is used in alloys with magnesium and aluminium to give very tough and light alloys.|$|E
5|$|Most other binary alloys are {{of little}} use: for example, silver–gold alloys are too soft and silver–cadmium alloys too toxic. Ternary alloys have much greater importance: dental {{amalgams}} are usually silver–tin–mercury alloys, silver–copper–gold alloys {{are very important}} in jewellery (usually on the gold-rich side) and have a vast range of hardnesses and colours, silver–copper–zinc alloys are useful as low-melting <b>brazing</b> alloys, and silver–cadmium–indium (involving three adjacent elements on the periodic table) is useful in nuclear reactors because of its high thermal neutron capture cross-section, good conduction of heat, mechanical stability, and resistance to corrosion in hot water.|$|E
5|$|Welding is a {{fabrication}} or sculptural {{process that}} joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing fusion, which {{is distinct from}} lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as <b>brazing</b> and soldering, which do not melt the base metal. In addition to melting the base metal, a filler material is typically added to the joint to form a pool of molten material (the weld pool) that cools to form a joint that is usually stronger than the base material. Pressure may also be {{used in conjunction with}} heat, or by itself, to produce a weld. Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Ti-coated {{diamond and}} the {{uncoated}} diamond were <b>brazed</b> with Ni-based filler alloy by high-frequency induction under argon atmosphere at 1050 ℃ within 15 seconds.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} utilization of <b>braze</b> repair {{in the gas}} turbine industry, the properties of <b>braze</b> joints under simulated service conditions become vital in selecting <b>braze</b> repair over other processes. While <b>braze</b> repair has often been claimed to deliver mechanical properties equivalent {{to that of the}} parent material, this is largely {{based on the results of}} tensile or accelerated creep tests for most gas turbine hot section components failure occurs as a result of thermal fatigue or thermomechanical fatigue. The damage that occurs under such conditions cannot be assessed from tensile or creep testing. This study was undertaken to characterize the fatigue properties of narrow and wide gap <b>brazed</b> X- 40 cobalt-based superalloy and compare these properties to that of the X- 40 parent material. Butt joint narrow gap and wide gap specimens were vacuum <b>brazed</b> using BNi- 9 <b>braze</b> alloy. X- 40 and IN- 738 were used as additive materials in wide gap <b>braze</b> joints.

5|$|Silver also forms alloys {{with most}} other {{elements}} on the periodic table. The elements from groups 1–3, except for hydrogen, lithium, and beryllium, are very miscible with {{silver in the}} condensed phase and form intermetallic compounds; those from groups 4–9 are only poorly miscible; the elements in groups 10–14 (except boron and carbon) have very complex Ag–M phase diagrams and form the most commercially important alloys; and the remaining elements on the periodic table have no consistency in their Ag–M phase diagrams. By far the most important such alloys are those with copper: most silver used for coinage and jewellery is in reality a silver–copper alloy, and the eutectic mixture is used in vacuum <b>brazing.</b> The two metals are completely miscible as liquids but not as solids; their importance in industry {{comes from the fact}} that their properties tend to be suitable over a wide range of variation in silver and copper concentration, although most useful alloys tend to be richer in silver than the eutectic mixture (71.9% silver and 28.1% copper by weight, and 60.1% silver and 28.1% copper by atom).|$|E

25|$|From {{the late}} 19th century until the 1970s, {{this method of}} frame {{construction}} was favored because the lower temperatures of <b>brazing</b> (silver <b>brazing</b> in particular) had less of {{a negative impact on}} the tubing strength than high temperature welding, which can seriously weaken many steel alloys. <b>Brazing</b> thus allowed relatively thin walled, lightweight tubes to be used without loss of strength. However, recent advances in metallurgy have created steel tubing that is not adversely affected (or may even be improved) by high temperature welding. This has allowed both TIG and MIG welding to displace lugged steel construction, in large part because these methods lend themselves more easily to automation and reduce the cost by eliminating the lugs.|$|E

40|$|When the <b>braze</b> melts, the carbide formers tend {{to migrate}} toward diamond to form carbide at the interface. This {{reaction}} may be excessive as to degrade diamond's integrity. In this case, a pre-coating of diamond {{may be needed}} to moderate the reactivity between diamond and <b>braze.</b> When diamond is <b>brazed</b> on the surface of a substrate, the melt tends to pull the grits closer together that may thicken the <b>braze</b> layer locally. The clustering of grits can reduce the cutting effectiveness of the diamond tool. A diamond grid design is necessary to maintain the uniform thickness of the <b>braze</b> layer. Moreover, the controlled melting of <b>braze</b> alloy can form a gentle slope around each diamond grit.

40|$|One of the {{essential}} steps in assuring reliable performance of high cost critical <b>brazed</b> structures is {{the assessment of the}} Margin of Safety (MS) of the <b>brazed</b> joints. In many cases the experimental determination of the failure loads by destructive testing of the <b>brazed</b> assembly is not practical and cost prohibitive. In such cases the evaluation of the MS is performed analytically by comparing the maximum design loads with the allowable ones and incorporating various safety or knock down factors imposed by the customer. Unfortunately, an industry standard methodology for the design and analysis of <b>brazed</b> joints has not been developed. This paper provides an example of an approach that was used to analyze an AlBeMet 162 (38 %Be- 62 %Al) structure <b>brazed</b> with the AWS BAlSi- 4 (Al- 12 %Si) filler metal. A practical and conservative interaction equation combining shear and tensile allowables was developed and validated to evaluate an acceptable (safe) combination of tensile and shear stresses acting in the <b>brazed</b> joint. These allowables are obtained from testing of standard tensile and lap shear <b>brazed</b> specimens. The proposed equation enables the assessment of the load carrying capability of complex <b>brazed</b> joints subjected to multi-axial loading...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} made to evaluate two nickel base alloys (Nickel- 201 and Inconel- 718) in three heat treated conditions. These conditions were: (1) annealed; (2) after thermal exposure simulating a <b>braze</b> cycle; and (3) after a thermal exposure simulating a <b>braze</b> cycle plus one operational lifetime of high temperature service. For the Nickel- 201, two different <b>braze</b> cycle temperatures were evaluated. A <b>braze</b> cycle utilizing a lower <b>braze</b> temperature resulted in less grain growth for Nickel- 201 than the standard <b>braze</b> cycle used for joining Nickel- 201 to Inconel- 718. It was determined, however, that Nickel- 201, was marginal for temperatures investigated due to large grain growth. After the thermal exposures described above, the mechanical properties of Nickel- 201 were degraded, whereas similar exposure on Inconel- 718 actually strengthened the material compared with the annealed condition. The investigation included tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperatures, stress-rupture tests, and metallographic examination...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the method {{to evaluate the}} <b>brazed</b> joints quantitatively through the ultrasonic C-scan images defined as three types that are overall area, localized area and honeycomb.

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the investigation of}} open-cell Ni-Cr metallic foams, analysing the mechanical properties of the material {{as well as the}} properties of <b>brazed</b> samples. Also investigated was the effectiveness of an ultrasound non-destructive evaluation technique used to analyse <b>braze</b> quality. The anisotropic structure of the foam sheets resulted in anisotropic properties, with a ‘dark band’ that was found to run through the longitudinal length of the material acting as the initial deformation site. Higher compressive strength samples corresponded with higher density areas, but strength is higher for relatively thinner strut samples where Cr has been able to fully diffuse, whereas tensile strength was found to be more dependent upon the defects within the struts of the foam. The shear failure of the foam was characterised by the collapse and subsequent densification of the cells at the point closest to the shear incursion face. Areas of some <b>brazed</b> samples had poor, even no, <b>braze</b> material coverage due to the wicking of the <b>braze</b> material by the struts. B, present in the <b>braze</b> layer, had diffused out forming Cr-B phases in the struts and the plate, as well as Ni-B phase within the <b>braze.</b> This left voids that weakened the <b>braze</b> bond, and the areas of Cr-B phase within the struts were found to be the most susceptible to corrosion The largest areas of good bond, determined by the ultrasound method, corresponded with higher strength samples. However the performance of the <b>braze</b> layer bond had less to do with the amount of <b>braze,</b> and {{more to do with the}} quality of the bond, with the quality increased with the right amount of wicking to bond the strut, but not too much that would cause the area bonded to the Ni plate to diminish...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Microstructure and {{properties}} of Zn-xAl alloy were investigated, moreover, {{the strength and}} microstructure of the Cu/Al <b>brazed</b> joint had been studied. The {{results indicate that the}} massive microstructure is granular and fine when Al content is under 15 wt. % in the cast microstructure of Zn-xAl filler metal. Meanwhile, the drawability {{properties of}} the filler metal is excellent. Thus, the massive microstructure become dendritic and coarse when Al content exceeds 15 wt. %. At the same time, the drawability properties of the filler metal become bad. In the microstructure of the <b>brazed</b> joint, the interface layer exists in the interface between the Cu base metal and the <b>brazed</b> seam. The interface layer is mainly consisted of Cu 9 Al 4 and CuAl IMCs. When Al content is under 15 wt. %, the interface layer shape is a visibly serrated edge, so the adhesive strength between the interface layer and the <b>brazed</b> seam is higher and the mechanical property of the <b>brazed</b> joint is excellent. The <b>brazed</b> joint strength of Zn- 15 Al filler metal get highest. But the interface zone become relatively straight when Al content exceeds 15 wt. %.

40|$|At {{the heart}} of any {{procedure}} for modelling and assessing the design or failure of dissimilar material <b>brazed</b> joints {{there must be a}} basic understanding of the metallurgy and mechanics of the joint. This paper is about developing this understanding and addressing the issues faced with modelling and predicting failure in real dissimilar material <b>brazed</b> joints and the challenges still to be overcome in many cases. An understanding of the key metallurgical features of such joints in relation to finite element modelling is presented in addition to a study of the mechanics and stress state at an abrupt interface between two materials. A discussion is also presented on why elastic singularities do not exist based on a consideration of the assumption of an abrupt change in material properties and plasticity {{in the vicinity of the}} joint. In terms of modelling real dissimilar material <b>brazed</b> joints; there are several barriers to accurately capturing the stress state in the region of the joint and across the <b>brazed</b> layer and these are discussed in relation to a metallurgical study of a real dissimilar material <b>brazed</b> joint.
