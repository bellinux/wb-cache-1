25|$|Equipment bonding {{conductors}} {{provide a}} low impedance path between normally non-current-carrying metallic parts of equipment and one of the conductors of that electrical system's source. If any exposed metal part should become energized (fault), such as by a frayed or damaged conductor, it creates a short circuit, causing the overprotection device (circuit breaker or fuse) to open, clearing (disconnecting) the fault. It is important to note this action occurs regardless of whether there is a connection to the physical ground (earth); the earth itself has no role in this fault-clearing process since current must return to its source; however, the sources are very frequently connected to the physical ground (earth). (see Kirchhoff's circuit laws). By bonding (interconnecting) all exposed non-current carrying metal objects together and to other metallic objects such as pipes or structural steel, they should remain near the same voltage potential, thus reducing the chance of a shock. This is especially important in bathrooms where one may be in contact with several different metallic systems such as supply and drain pipes and appliance frames. When a system needs to be connected to the physical ground (earth), the equipment <b>bonding</b> <b>conductor</b> also becomes the equipment earthing conductor (see above).|$|E

The air terminals are typically arranged at or along the upper points of a roof structure, and are electrically bonded together by <b>bonding</b> <b>conductors</b> (called [...] "down conductors" [...] or [...] "downleads"), which are connected by the most direct route to one or more grounding or earthing terminals.

50|$|Some {{types of}} metal conduit may {{also serve as}} a useful <b>bonding</b> <b>conductor</b> for {{grounding}} (earthing), but wiring regulations may also dictate workmanship standards or supplemental means of grounding for certain types. While metal conduit may sometimes be used as a grounding conductor, the circuit length is limited. For example, a long run of conduit as grounding conductor may have too high an electrical resistance, and not allow proper operation of overcurrent devices on a fault.|$|E
50|$|Grounding (earthing) of {{distribution}} circuits is a notable difference in practice between wiring {{systems of the}} United States {{and those of other}} regions. Since the early 1960s, wiring in new construction has required a separate grounding conductor used to bond (electrically connect) all normally non-current carrying parts of an electrical installation. Portable appliances with metal cases also have a <b>bonding</b> <b>conductor</b> in the flexible cable and plug connecting them to the distribution system. The circuit return conductor (neutral) is also connected to ground at the service entrance panel only; no other connections from neutral to ground are allowed, unlike regulations {{in other parts of the}} world.|$|E
5000|$|Fiberglass-reinforced epoxy (FRE), or {{fiberglass}} conduit, {{also known}} as reinforced thermosetting resin conduit (RTRC) [...] is light in weight compared to metallic conduits, which contributes to lower labor costs. It may also provide lower material cost. RTRC conduit {{can be used in}} a variety of indoor and outdoor applications. [...] Fiberglass conduit is available in multiple wall thicknesses to suit various applications and has a support distance very similar to steel. High temperature, low smoke, no flame, classified area (Class I Division 2), and zero halogen versions are also manufactured for specialty applications such as subway tunnels and stations and in the US can meet NFPA 130 requirements. Like other non-metallic conduits, a <b>bonding</b> <b>conductor</b> may be required for grounding. Joints are epoxy-glued, which requires some installation labor and time for joints to set. FRE conduit may not be bent in the field and appropriate fittings must be used to change directions, nor is FRE conduit approved to support luminaires.|$|E

A transverse crack is observed across the joint from the conductor/substrate interface to the conductor/solder interface, which results in the failure of the joint. The microstructural analysis and stress analysis reveal that the transverse crack is initiated by the mlcrocracks at the glass penetrated region of the substrate and propagates under a tensile stress due to the solder shrink-age.

40|$|An {{extensive}} R&D {{program has}} been conducted that has confirmed the feasibility of designing and fabricating copper alloy magnets that can successfully operate at temperatures as high as 350 C. The process, originally developed {{for the possibility of}} manufacturing in-vessel resonant magnetic field perturbation (RMP) coils for JET, has been optimized for insulated magnet (and, potentially, other high temperature component) applications. One of the benefits of high temperature operation is that active cooling may no longer be required, greatly simplifying magnet/component design. These elevated temperatures are beyond the safe operating limits of conventional OFHC copper and the epoxies that bond and insulate the turns of typical magnets. This would necessitate the use an alternative copper alloy conductor such as C 18150 (CuCrZr). Coil manufacture with polyimide is very similar to conventional epoxy <b>bonded</b> coils. <b>Conductors</b> would be dry wound then impregnated with polyimide of low enough viscosity to permit saturation, then cured; similar to the vacuum pressure impregnation process used for conventional epoxy bonded coils.

Wire, 25. 4, 38. 1 and 50. 8 um (1, 1. 5 and 2 mil), was used with bonding metallization consisting of thick film gold, thin film gold and aluminum as well as conventional aluminum pads on semiconductor chips. The chief tool for evaluating the performance was the double bond pull test {{in conjunction with a}} 72 hour - 150 C heat soak and - 65 C to + 150 C thermal cycling. In practice the thermal cycling was found to have relatively little effect compared to the heat soak. Pull strength will decrease after heat soak as a result of annealing of the aluminum wire; when bonded to thick film gold, the pull strength decreased by about 50 % (weakening of the bond interface was the major cause of the reduction). Bonds to thin film gold lost about 30 - 40 % of their initial pull strenth; weakening of the wire itself at the bond heel was the predominant cause. Bonds to aluminum substrate metallization lost only about 22 %. Bonds between thick and thin film gold substrate metallization and semiconductor chips substantiated the previous conclusions but also showed that in about 20 to 25 % of the cases, bond interface failure occurred at the semiconductor chip...|$|R

50|$|Copper {{is vital}} to the {{electrical}} grounding system for wind turbine farms. Turbine masts attract lightning strikes, so they require lightning protection systems. When lightning strikes a turbine blade, current passes along the blade, through the blade hub in the nacelle (gearbox/ generator enclosure) and down the mast to a grounding system. The blade incorporates a large cross-section copper conductor that runs along its length and allows current to pass along the blade without deleterious heating effects. The nacelle is protected by a lightning conductor, often copper. The grounding system, {{at the base of the}} mast, consists of a thick copper ring <b>conductor</b> <b>bonded</b> to the base or located within a meter of the base. The ring is attached to two diametrically opposed points on the mast base. Copper leads extend outward from the ring and connect to copper grounding electrodes. The grounding rings at turbines on wind farms are inter-connected, providing a networked system with an extremely small aggregate resistance.|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{multilayer}} (ML) circuitry provides increased den-sity, reduced {{signal path}} and optimum high speed performance re-quired for today's electronic assemblies. Products ranging from supercomputers to automotive engine controllers now depend on multilayer technology. But the modern multilayer circuit, with its full length Plated-Through Boles (PTH), {{is a highly}} stressed structure, prone to del-amination, barrel fracture and other modes of self [...] destruction. The plating of copper into smaller and smaller diameter holes, of ever increasing length, has brought us close to the practical lim-its of this technology. Cumulative stress and plating limitations combine to make layer count and yield an inverse relationship. Worse yet, reliability is often dramatically compromised as layer count increases. Advances in anisotropic bonding materials and a fresh approach to ML constructions, now make a reliable 100 - layer circuit pos-sible. Stress-free multilayer circuitry can now be fabricated in a simple process utilizing anisotropic technology and other inter-connects. Multilayer circuitry is fabricated by laminating double-sided circuits together with special anisotropic <b>bonding</b> film. Opposing <b>conductor</b> pads on adjacent layers are electrically connected and mechanically bonded during the laminating process. Solder microspheres, dispersed within a dimensionally stable thermosetting dielectric adhesive, provide permanent interlayer connections. A host of benefits accrue for most applications without penal-ties. Reduced cost and increased reliability are key attributes of the new process. A remarkable characteristic of the construc-tion is that stress is non-cumulative and totally independent of the layer count.
