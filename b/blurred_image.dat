40|$|Abstract. Digital {{photos are}} massively {{produced}} while digital cameras are becoming popular, however, not every photo has good quality. Blur {{is one of}} the conventional image quality degradation which is caused by various factors. In this paper, we propose a scheme to detect <b>blurred</b> <b>images</b> and classify them into several different categories. The blur detector uses support vector machines to estimate the blur extent of an <b>image.</b> The <b>blurred</b> <b>images</b> are further classified into either locally or globally <b>blurred</b> <b>images.</b> For globally <b>blurred</b> <b>images,</b> we estimate their point spread functions and classify them into camera shake or out of focus <b>images.</b> For locally <b>blurred</b> <b>images,</b> we find the blurred regions using a segmentation method, and the point spread function estimation on the blurred region can sort out the images with depth of field or moving object. The blur detection and classification processes are fully automatic and can help users to filter out <b>blurred</b> <b>images</b> before importing the photos into their digital photo albums. ...|$|R

2500|$|Schooling {{behaviour}} confuses {{the lateral}} line organ (LLO) {{as well as}} the electrosensory system (ESS) of predators. Fin movements of a single fish act as a point-shaped wave source, emitting a gradient by which predators might localize it. Since fields of many fish will overlap, schooling should obscure this gradient, perhaps mimicking pressure waves of a larger animal, and more likely confuse the lateral line perception. The LLO is essential {{in the final stages of}} a predator attack. Electro-receptive animals may localize a field source by using spatial non-uniformities. In order to produce separate signals, individual prey must be about five body widths apart. If objects are too close together to be distinguished, they will form a <b>blurred</b> <b>image.</b> Based on this it was suggested that [...] schooling may confuse the ESS of predators ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{perceived}} <b>blur</b> {{of moving}} <b>images</b> {{is less than}} expected given the sluggish temporal response of the visual system. This suggests that a motion deblurring mechanism may exist to preserve the positional acuity and sharpness of moving images. Furthermore, when sequences of blurred stills are presented, observers report that the moving image is in sharp focus raising {{the possibility that there}} is a mechanism which may sharpen the appearance of moving, <b>blurred</b> <b>images.</b> We have measured the effects of velocity and contrast on the perceived blur of drifting, <b>blurred</b> <b>images</b> (sine gratings and blurred edges). Subjects matched the perceived blur of drifting, <b>blurred</b> <b>images</b> to that of static, <b>blurred</b> <b>images</b> in a dimly lit room. It was found that perceived blur was inversely related to drift speed and contrast. The results confirm that moving, <b>blurred</b> <b>images</b> may appear sharper than when they are static. This finding is not consistent with some models of motion deblurring since these account only for the preservation of sharp contours that are present in the image and not for the sharp appearance of images that are in fact blurred...|$|R

I like to remember, as I do, ineffaceably, that my attention attached itself, intensely and on the spot, to the very picture, with whatever else, conveyed, which for that matter hangs before me still: the vision of my brother, agitated by the growth of his genius, moving in his burst of confidence, his bright earnestness, about the room I knew, which must have been our admirable parent's study--with that admirable parent himself almost holding his breath for the charm and the accepted peace of it, after earlier discussions and reserves; to say nothing too, if charm was in question, of the fact of rarity and beauty I must have felt, or in any case at present feel, in the resource for such an intellectually living and fermenting son of such a spiritually perceiving and responding sire. What was the whole passage but a vision of the fine private luxury of each?--with the fine private luxury of my own almost <b>blurred</b> <b>image</b> of it superadded. Of that same spring of '69 is another page addressed to myself in Europe. My memory must at the very time have connected itself with what had remained to me of our common or certainly of my own inveterate, childish appeal to him, in early New York days, for repetition, in the winter afternoon firelight, of his most personal, most remembering and picture-recovering [...] "story"; that of a visit paid by him about in his nineteenth year, as I make it out, to his Irish relatives, his father's nephews, nieces and cousins, with a younger brother or two perhaps, as I set the scene forth--which it conduced to our liveliest interest to see [...] "Billy Taylor," [...] the negro servant accompanying him from Albany, altogether rule {{from the point of view}} of effect. The dignity of this apparition indeed, I must parenthesise, would have yielded in general to the source of a glamour still more marked--the very air in which the young emissary would have moved as the son of his father and the representative of an American connection prodigious surely in its power to dazzle. William James of Albany was at that time approaching the term of his remarkably fruitful career, and as I see the fruits of it stated on the morrow of his death--in the New York Evening Post of December 20th 1832, for instance, I find myself envying the friendly youth who could bring his modest Irish k{{in such a}} fairytale from over the sea. I attach as I hang upon the passage a melancholy gaze to the cloud of images of what might have been for us all that it distractingly throws off. Our grandfather's energy, exercised in Albany from the great year 1789, appears promptly to have begun with his arrival there. [...] "Everywhere we see his footsteps, turn where we may, and these are the results of his informing mind and his vast wealth. His plans of improvement embraced the entire city, and there is scarcely a street or a square which does not exhibit some mark of his hand or some proof of his opulence. With the exception of Mr. Astor," [...] this delightful report goes on to declare, [...] "no other business man has acquired so great a fortune in this State. To his enormous estate of three millions of dollars there are nine surviving heirs. His enterprises have for the last ten years furnished constant employment for hundreds of our mechanics and labourers." [...] The enterprises appear, alas, to have definitely ceased, or to have fallen into less able hands, with his death--and to the mass of property so handsomely computed the heirs were, more exactly, not nine but a good dozen. Which fact, however, reduces but by a little the rich ambiguity of the question that was to flit before my father's children, as they grew up, with an air of impenetrability that I remember no attempt on his own part to mitigate. I doubt, for that matter, whether he could in the least have appeased our all but haunting wonder as to what had become even in the hands of twelve heirs, he himself naturally being one, of the admirable three millions. The various happy and rapid courses of most of the participants accounted for much, but did they account for the full beautiful value, and would even the furthest stretch of the charming legend of his own early taste for the amusements of the town really tell us what had been the disposition, by such a measure, of his share? Our dear parent, we were later quite to feel, could have told us very little, in all probability, under whatever pressure, what had become of anything. There had been, by our inference, a general history--not on the whole exhilarating, and pressure for information could never, I think, have been applied; wherefore the question arrests me only through the brightly associated presumption that the Irish visit was made, to its extreme enlivening, in the character of a gilded youth, a youth gilded an inch thick and shining to effulgence on the scene not otherwise brilliant. Which image appeals to my filial fidelity--even though I hasten not to sacrifice the circle evoked, that for which I a trifle unassuredly figure a small town in county Cavan as forming an horizon, and which consisted, we used to delight to hear with every contributive circumstance, of the local lawyer, the doctor and the (let us hope--for we did hope) principal [...] "merchant," [...] whose conjoined hospitality appeared, as it was again agreeable to know, to have more than graced the occasion: the main definite pictorial touches that have lingered with me being that all the doors always stood open, with the vistas mostly raking the provision of whiskey on every table, and that these opportunities were much less tempting (to our narrator) than that of the quest of gooseberries in the garden with a certain beautiful Barbara, otherwise anonymous, who was not of the kin but on a visit from a distance at one of the genial houses. We liked to hear about Barbara, liked the sound of her still richer rarer surname; which in spite of the fine Irish harmony it even then struck me as making I have frivolously forgotten. She had been matchlessly fair and she ate gooseberries with a charm that was in itself of the nature of a brogue--so that, as I say, we couldn't have too much of her; yet even her measure dwindled, for our appetite, beside the almost epic shape of black Billy Taylor carrying off at every juncture alike the laurel and the bay. He singularly appealed, it was clear, to the Irish imagination, performing in a manner never to disappoint it; his young master--in those days, even in the North, young mastership hadn't too long since lapsed to have lost every grace of its tradition--had been all cordially acclaimed, but not least, it appeared, because so histrionically attended: he had been the ringmaster, as it were, of the American circus, the small circus of two, but the other had been the inimitable clown. My point is that we repaired retrospectively to the circus as insatiably as our Irish cousins had of old attended it in person--even for the interest of which fact, however, my father's words have led me too far. What here follows, I must nevertheless add, would carry me on again, for development of reference, should I weakly allow it. The allusion to my brother Wilky's vividly independent verbal collocations and commentative flights re-echoes afresh, for instance, as one of the fond by-words that spoke most of our whole humorous harmony. Just so might the glance at the next visitor prompt a further raising of the curtain, save that this is a portrait to which, for lack of acquaintance with the original, I have nothing to contribute--beyond repeating again that it was ever the sign of my father's portraits to supply almost more than anything else material for a vision of himself.|$|E
