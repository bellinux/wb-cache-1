50|$|A <b>Back-to-back</b> <b>loan</b> is a loan {{agreement}} between entities in two {{countries in which}} the currencies remain separate but the maturity dates remain fixed. The gross interest rates of the loan are separate as well and are set {{on the basis of}} the commercial rates in place when the agreement is signed.|$|E
50|$|Currency swaps were {{originally}} conceived in the 1970s to circumvent foreign exchange controls in the United Kingdom. At that time, UK companies {{had to pay}} a premium to borrow in US Dollars. To avoid this, UK companies set up <b>back-to-back</b> <b>loan</b> agreements with US companies wishing to borrow Sterling. While such restrictions on currency exchange have since become rare, savings are still available from back-to-back loans due to comparative advantage.|$|E
50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of such agreements is asymmetrical liability - absent a specific agreement, when one party defaults on the loan, {{the other party}} may still {{be held responsible for}} repayment. Another disadvantage in comparison with currency swaps is that <b>back-to-back</b> <b>loan</b> transactions are customarily recorded on banking institutions' records as liabilities and thereby increase their capitalization requirements, while currency swaps were, during the 2000s, widely exempted from this requirement.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>back-to-back</b> <b>loans</b> come due within 10 years, due {{to their}} {{inherent}} risks. Initiated {{as a way of}} avoiding currency regulations, the practice had, by the mid-1990s, largely been replaced by currency swaps.|$|R
40|$|Comments welcome Can {{widespread}} fraud cause {{large scale}} banking crises? We {{address this issue}} {{in the context of}} the recent Turkish banking crisis of 1999, which was followed by a severe currency crisis. Using detailed micro-level transactions data from a bankrupt bank, we show that related lending and <b>back-to-back</b> <b>loans</b> across banks were used to circumvent regulation and transfer deposits to private holding companies that were ruined. Our evidence suggests that systemic fraud can be a source of banking crisis...|$|R
50|$|So {{that which}} is {{commonly}} done and not stopped {{is not likely to}} be contrary to the intention of Parliament. It follows that tax reduction arrangements which have been carried on for a long time are unlikely to constitute tax avoidance. Judges have a strong intuitive sense that that which everyone does, and has long done, should not be stigmatised with the pejorative term of “avoidance”. Thus UK courts refused to regard sales and repurchases (known as bed-and-breakfast transactions) or <b>back-to-back</b> <b>loans</b> as tax avoidance.|$|R
50|$|Dudley {{made his}} Football League debut for Bury in EFL League Two on 18 January 2014, coming on as a {{substitute}} for Tom Soares in the 87th minute against Burton Albion at Gigg Lane. After <b>back-to-back</b> <b>loan</b> spells with National League team Guiseley, with whom he made 16 appearances and scored 7 goals, Dudley signed for another National League side on loan, Macclesfield Town, in January 2017. He joined Macclesfield as part of the transfer of Jack Mackreth to Bury.|$|E
50|$|The {{parallel}} loan {{is very similar}} to a <b>back-to-back</b> <b>loan.</b> The {{parallel loan}} was one of the proactive management of operating exposure that offsetting expected foreign exchange exposure. Two business companies in different countries will borrow currency to each other for a particular period of time and they will return the borrowed currencies on the date they agreed to with the same loaned amount. The two loans will be valued at the prevailing spot rate and the prescribed period. The currencies borrowing activities conducted outside the foreign exchange market to avoid foreign exchange risk and legal limitations.|$|E
50|$|The {{parallel}} loan {{was established in}} the early 1970s in effect of the exchange controls in the United Kingdom on British companies. The implementation of exchange control has caused many British firms withdrawn their decision to extend their business because investing in foreign market is not attractive. After the abolition of foreign exchange control in 1979, {{parallel loan}} kept on being utilized with the goal of hedging long-term foreign currency exposure at a lower cost than what will be imposed in the foreign exchange market. At that time, UK organizations needed to pay a premium to get a loan in US dollars. In order to prevent this situation, UK organizations set up parallel or <b>back-to-back</b> <b>loan</b> agreement with US organizations that wish to acquire sterling.|$|E
