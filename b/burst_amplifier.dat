40|$|The {{long-term}} {{stability of}} optical parametric chirped-pulse amplifiers is hindered by thermal path length drifts affecting the temporal pump-to-signal overlap. A kilowatt-pumped <b>burst</b> <b>amplifier</b> is presented delivering broadband 1. 4 mJ pulses with a spectral bandwidth supporting sub- 7 fs pulse duration. Active temporal overlap control {{can be achieved}} by feedback of optical timing signals from cross-correlation or spectral measurements. Using a balanced optical cross-correlator, we achieve a pump-to-signal synchronization with a residual jitter of only (46 ± 2) fs rms. Additionally, we propose passive pump-to-signal stabilization with an intrinsic jitter of (7. 0 ± 0. 5) fs rms using white-light continuum generation...|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{topology}} of PON, {{the transmission}} modes for downstream (that is, from OLT to ONU) and upstream (that is, from ONU to OLT) are different. For the downstream transmission, the OLT broadcasts optical signal {{to all the}} ONUs in continuous mode (CM), that is, the downstream channel always has optical data signal. However, in the upstream channel, ONUs can not transmit optical data signal in CM. Use of CM would result {{in all of the}} signals transmitted from the ONUs converging (with attenuation) into one fiber by the power splitter (serving as power coupler), and overlapping. To solve this problem, burst mode (BM) transmission is adopted for upstream channel. The given ONU only transmits optical packet when it is allocated a time slot and it needs to transmit, and all the ONUs share the upstream channel in the time division multiplexing (TDM) mode. The phases of the BM optical packets received by the OLT are different from packet to packet, since the ONUs are not synchronized to transmit optical packet in the same phase, and the distance between OLT and given ONU are random. Since the distance between the OLT and ONUs are not uniform, the optical packets received by the OLT may have different amplitudes. In order to compensate the phase variation and amplitude variation in a short time (for example within 40 ns for GPON), burst mode clock and data recovery (BM-CDR) and <b>burst</b> mode <b>amplifier</b> (for example <b>burst</b> mode TIA) need to be employed, respectively. Furthermore, the BM transmission mode requires the transmitter to work in burst mode. Such a burst mode transmitter is able to turn on and off in short time. The above three kinds of circuitries in PON are quite different from their counterparts in the point-to-point continuous mode optical communication link.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown in the past that pulsed laser systems {{operating}} in the so-called “burst mode” are a beneficial approach to generate high peak power laser pulses at high repetition rates suitable for various applications. So far, most high-energy burst-mode laser systems put great effort into generating a homogeneous energy distribution across the burst duration, e. g., by shaping the pump pulse. In this work, we present a new shaping technique, which is able to produce arbitrary energy distributions within the burst by pre-shaping the seed pulse burst with a Pockels cell. Furthermore, this technique allows for the precompensation of any static modulations across the burst, which may be introduced during the subsequent amplification process. Therefore, a pulse burst with a uniform energy distribution can also be generated. The method is tested with an ultra-short pulse <b>burst</b> mode laser <b>amplifier</b> system producing <b>bursts</b> of a 1 ms duration with a pulse repetition rate of 1 MHz and a maximum output power of 800 W during the burst. Furthermore, a method to predict the influence of the amplifier on a non-uniformly shaped burst is presented and successfully tested to produce a pre-defined pulse shape after amplification...|$|R
40|$|Recently, themobilemarket {{has grown}} tremendously and mobile devices have become {{ubiquitous}} and indispensable {{in our daily}} life. This introduced a new era for themobile market where the main focus {{is to reduce the}} cost and power consumption of battery supplied devices. The power amplifier is a key component in all wireless communication systems. In most of today’s smartphones and other mobile devices, the RF Power Amplifier is predominantly designed in a more exotic technology. To reduce the cost and environmental footprint, it is desirable to completely integrate the RF PA and the entire transceiver into a single system-on-chip (SoC). In addition, the new wireless and mobile communication standards introduce new challenges for fully-integrated power amplifiers. One major challenge is the efficient generation of a Watt-level output power despite the low-breakdown voltage in nanometer scale technologies. As the voltage dropswith the technology scaling, not only the output power and efficiency, but also the stringent requirements on linearity become significantly harder. Certainly, due to the increased data rate, high linearity over instantaneous wide bandwidth is needed in future mobile communication standards. Unlike analog and RF circuitry, digital circuits benefit from technology scaling. Therefore, if a PA is used in switched mode, voltage linearity is not required. A switched-mode PA (SMPA) cannot amplify amplitude modulated (AM) signals, but using techniques such as pulse width modulation (PWM), the amplitude information can be encoded in the time domain and hence efficiently amplified. This thesis manuscript addresses the major challenges of integrating linear and simultaneously highly efficient PAs and PA architectures in standard nanometer technologies in the frequency range from 900 MHz to 5 GHz. In total, four different PAs have been designed: two linear RF PAs, one linear RF PA with integrated power detector and finally a reconfigurable digital RF PA. All RF PAs are designed to cope with several major challenges for fully-integrated RF PA design. The first linear PA is a two-stage power amplifier with a clover-shaped distributed active transformer (DAT) combiner in a standard 90 nm CMOS technology targeting the LTE-communication standard. This test chip achieves the required Watt-level output power for all modern mobile communication standards: an output power of 29. 4 dBm is delivered to the antenna with 25. 8 % power added efficiency (PAE). The RF PA was evaluated with a 10 MHz 16 -QAM LTE uplink signal with 7 dB PAPR for LTE-band VIII in the 900 -MHz range. Experimental results show that all stringent linearity requirements are satisfied with 15 %PAE at an average output power of 25. 1 dBm, which is more than the required 23 dBm average output power level. Due to the implementation of a linearity improvement technique, the second RF PA, fabricated in a 180 nm SOI RF PA, is highly linear even over a wide instantaneous bandwidth. This high linearity over a wide bandwidth is required for all future mobile communication standards. The performance of the RF PA is observed for a 64 -QAM 20 MHz LTE-advanced uplink signal (PAPR= 8. 8 dB). This second RF PA delivers a 22. 4 dBm with 21. 7 % PAE, while simultaneously obey all linearity requirements. In addition, the RF PA achieves similar performance at LTE-band I (1. 9 GHz) up till LTE-band VII (2. 5 GHz) The high linearity of the RF PA allows to transmit a LTE-advanced uplink signal even up to a 60 MHz instantaneous bandwidth with a 10. 3 dB PAPR efficiently. Since the power amplifier is the most power hungry building block in a transmitter, the third linear RF PA is integrated together with an on-chip power detector in a 40 nm standard CMOS technology. The on-chip power detector detects both the RF output current and the RF output voltage to monitor the output power of the RF PA and hence is able to measure the output power even for non-fixed 50 Ohm load. The power detector introduces a sense winding to measure the RF output current. The RF PA is a single stage RF PA using transformer-based input and output matching to support the 5 GHz WLAN IEEE 802. 11 ac communication standard. With continuous wave signals, the RF PA achieves 38. 8 %PAE and a drain efficiency of 49. 9 %at a 24 dBm output power. With a 40 MHz 64 -QAM WLAN signal at 5 GHz, the RF PA transmits 16. 9 dBm while operating with 17. 3 % efficiently. Finally, a burst-mode RF transmitter was presented to achieve efficiency enhancement. A fully-integrated Burst Mode transmitter has been realized using aforementioned fully integratedWatt-level RF PA togetherwith a baseband PWMmodulator processed in 65 nm standard CMOS, designed by P. Nuyts. During Burst-Mode operation, the RF PA operates always in saturation. And at 930 MHz, it has a gain of 31 dB at low duty cycles and drops to 29 dB at peak output power. It implies that the variation over the whole duty cycle range is limited to 2 dB. This proves the inherent linear behavior of the <b>burst</b> mode <b>amplifier.</b> At 100 % duty cycle, the power amplifier delivers a peak output power of 28. 8 dBm with 23. 7 % PAE. While applying a 20 MHz WLAN IEEE 802. 11 b/g to the PA, the RF PA achieves 11. 7 % PAE at 23. 1 dBm average output power, where the EVM limit is reached. The transmitter clearly satisfies the industry-based LTE EVM specification of 5. 6 % for output powers ranging from about 14 to 23 dBm. This proved the potential for a single chip design. Consequently, a fourth single chip fully-integrated reconfigurable multilevel PWM transmitter was designed in a 40 nm standard CMOS. To fully-digital multi-level RF PA is implemented in a 40 nm standard CMOS process to generate a multi-level PWM signal {{and at the same time}} achieve the required watt-level output power for modern mobile systems. This RF PA architecture uses transformer-based series power combiner to sum the output power of several power amplifiers. Due to the multi-mode operation, simulations show still 3. 5 times more efficiency at 15 dB back-off than a conventional Class B amplifier. Simultaneously, this multi-mode RF PA extends the dynamic range by 15 dB and hence doesn’t constrain this digital transmitter architecture to modulated signals with only low PAPR. Due to technical issues, experiments could never confirm the multi-level operation nor the 3. 5 times more efficiency than a conventional Class B at 15 dB back-off.
