5|$|Mr. Burns is {{at first}} shocked, but after {{acknowledging}} the resemblance admits that Larry {{was the product}} of a one-night stand with the daughter of a former flame at a college reunion. At first, Mr. Burns is overjoyed to have a son and tries to shape Larry after himself. Burns takes Larry to fancy parties and tries to have him enrolled in Yale, <b>but</b> <b>Larry</b> keeps acting like an oaf and proves to be an embarrassment. Larry is put to work in Sector 7G at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant alongside Homer and the two become friends. Larry invites Homer to dinner, and at dinner, Mr. Burns becomes frustrated due to Larry's boorishness and tells him that he wishes he had no son. Homer tries to convince Larry to fake a kidnapping so that Burns will admit that he loves his son, and although Larry at first opposes the idea, he eventually agrees to do it and moves into the Simpsons' basement. Homer calls Mr. Burns and says that he can have Larry back if he admits that he loves him. Marge discovers the plan and convinces Homer and Larry to abandon their plot, but as they leave the house, they are spotted.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Wikipedia, Nupedia {{was not a}} wiki; it {{was instead}} {{characterized}} by an extensive peer-review process, designed to make its articles of a quality {{comparable to that of}} professional encyclopedias. Nupedia wanted scholars (ideally with PhDs) to volunteer content. Before it ceased operating, Nupedia produced 25 approved articles that had completed its review process (three articles also existed in two versions of different lengths), and 74 more articles were in progress. Jimmy Wales preferred Wikipedia's easier posting of articles, <b>but</b> <b>Larry</b> Sanger wanted to control content at Nupedia and founded Citizendium instead.|$|E
500|$|By early April, most NBA draft analysts {{thought he}} would be {{selected}} in the second round, <b>but</b> <b>Larry</b> Butler, his former AAU coach with the Illinois Warriors, thought he might go late in the first round. He's shown his toughness, his will to win. He brings all those little intangibles to the table that the elite players do. He's always making the right pass, always making the big shots, always making the big plays, always making his free throws.... The kid is a winner. He's always been a winner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here they come! there's Blake leading. What a stride {{that horse}} has! but you'll see he'll die away now. Larry's second--no, George is second, <b>but</b> <b>Larry's</b> well up." ...|$|R
60|$|BROADBENT. Ah, yes, yes: {{efficiency}} is the thing. I don't {{in the least}} mind your chaff, Mr Keegan; <b>but</b> <b>Larry's</b> right on the main point. The world belongs to the efficient.|$|R
50|$|Larry also distinguishes {{differences}} between the miners themselves. His father and his father’s friend, “Frenchy” are both educated. So is Lionel Stafford, <b>but</b> <b>Larry’s</b> father doesn’t get along with Mr. Stafford. Lionel flaunts his education whereas Larry’s father does not.|$|R
500|$|Onstage, Me and Juliet is concluding. After the {{internal}} show finishes ("Finale to Me and Juliet"), Larry, {{who will be}} the new stage manager, insists on rehearsing a scene from the show. Seeing Bob enter with a scowl, Larry orders him and Sidney to be present the next morning to re-angle the lights. Taken aback, and rather sheepishly, Bob says [...] "I didn't know you were married" [...] before quietly leaving, after stating, [...] "I'll be here, I guess." [...] Jeanie is congratulated by her showmates, <b>but</b> <b>Larry,</b> all business, waves them to their places to rehearse the scene. As Lily has had to leave, Jeanie stands in for her as Juliet, while Larry sings the part of Me in the scene, as the curtain falls ("Finale of Our Play").|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. David based the story on a personal experience of his, when he gave a ride home {{to a woman who}} had recently dated a friend of his. He would frequently come up with the idea for an episode and make it into a teleplay with Seinfeld's help; in a 1991 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Seinfeld stated: [...] "Most of the stories are from [...] life. He just has a tremendous wellspring of ideas. I mean, he just fills notebooks with ideas and I try to help him, <b>but</b> <b>Larry</b> is really the designer of the show." [...] David Sims of The A.V. Club commented, [...] "Seinfeld started its second season, its first real season after a four-episode test run, very strongly with [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend", and {{it is the first time}} we really see George as the character we know and love, that weird dark shadow of Larry David's mind who behaves as no functioning human being honestly could." ...|$|E
500|$|One year later, Sally and Larry {{have opened}} a {{combined}} book and DVD store. Sally insists on keeping a folder of the events, including Larry's completed transcript, <b>but</b> <b>Larry</b> {{wants her to}} move on and indicates he has feelings for her. Sally gently rebuffs him and Larry steps out on an errand. Sally sees the Doctor and Martha hurriedly leave a taxi in front of the shop and goes outside to meet them. They don't recognise her and she realises that they have yet to experience the events that sent them to the past. She hands the Doctor the folder, warning him that he will need it in his future. The Doctor and Sally say goodbye as Larry returns, surprised to see the man from the Easter egg. Sally and Larry return to the shop hand in hand, hinting that she is now ready for a romantic relationship. The episode ends with a repeat of the Doctor's [...] "don't blink" [...] warning to Sally, this time directed at the viewer and overlaid with flashes of famous statues.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I never!" [...] {{came from}} him, {{a few minutes}} later. [...] "Si, Walton, listen to this! My brother Larry was with Dewey at Manila and helped whip the Dons! Oh, <b>but</b> <b>Larry's</b> the boy, after all! Just read the letter for yourselves." [...] And he tossed it over.|$|R
25|$|Cheryl {{is tired}} of Larry not working, so he begins {{to develop a new}} {{television}} show, initially with guest stars Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (George and Elaine, respectively, on Seinfeld) as themselves. <b>But</b> <b>Larry's</b> constant social faux pas ruin the chances of the show being financed by a major television network.|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> still <b>Larry</b> {{gazed up}} at him with that wistful questioning, and not till he had repeated, [...] "Understand?" [...] did he receive [...] "Yes" [...] for answer.|$|R
500|$|When Mr. Wick (Craig Ferguson) {{is asked}} to look after Mrs. Lauder's (Nan Martin) prize-winning Hungarian Puli, he decides to pass the task on to his {{employee}} Drew (Drew Carey). Kate O'Brien (Christa Miller) offers to take the dog, Lucky, to Drew's house; but she has to leave suddenly {{to pick up her}} boyfriend Oswald (Diedrich Bader). Drew does not see Kate's note and assumes Lucky is a stray. He takes it to the vet to get it shaved and neutered. When Kate sees the dog, she fears that she, Drew and Mr. Wick will be fired. She finds an advertisement for a pure bred Hungarian Puli, but it costs $4,500. Since no one has that kind of money, Oswald suggests they sell their bodies for money. Inspired by The Full Monty, the guys decide to perform a striptease at The Warsaw Tavern to make the money they need. Lewis Kiniski (Ryan Stiles) backs out of the performance at the last minute, <b>but</b> <b>Larry</b> Almada (Ian Gomez) steps in as his replacement.|$|E
500|$|Frobisher's {{attorney}} Ray Fiske visits David's sister Katie (Anastasia Griffith), who {{is opening}} {{a restaurant in}} which Frobisher is investing, and asks her to sign a confidentiality agreement. Frobisher meets with his former custodian Larry Popler (Victor Arnold), who names a settlement price of $100 million, which Ray returns to Patty. Patty persuades her clients to decline the offer, <b>but</b> <b>Larry</b> mentions a previous agreement to accept any offer of $100 million. Patty suspects that her advisor Tom (Tate Donovan) had known about the agreement and fires him. Katie, meanwhile, thinks that she is being watched, and tells Ellen and David that she had catered a function for Frobisher in Florida and that afterwards he had offered to help her open a restaurant. Ellen realizes that Patty hired her to get to Katie, a potential witness. Though Katie is initially hesitant to testify, she finds her dog Saffron dead in her apartment with a note reading [...] "Quiet" [...] pinned to a wall. Assuming that Frobisher is responsible, she agrees to meet with Patty to help bring Frobisher down. Tom meets with Patty, who had only pretended to fire him, and gives her Saffron's collar, which she throws into the ocean.|$|E
2500|$|Child {{actor and}} martial artist Leo Howard, and martial artist/stuntman Ray Park, play young Snake Eyes and adult Snake Eyes respectively, {{in the film}} {{adaptation}} [...] In an early draft by Stuart Beattie, Snake Eyes would have spoken as a gag, <b>but</b> <b>Larry</b> Hama convinced him to drop the joke.|$|E

6000|$|... "Then, {{as sure as}} fate, {{they are}} up to some mischief," [...] Mr. Davenant said. [...] "Walter is bad enough by himself, <b>but</b> with <b>Larry</b> to help him, {{it would take a}} {{regiment}} to look after them." ...|$|R
60|$|Two {{men were}} {{approaching}} the warehouse, both tall, slim, and evidently of Spanish extraction. They were talking loudly and excitedly to one another; <b>but</b> as <b>Larry</b> understood <b>but</b> {{few words of}} Spanish, {{what they were saying}} was lost upon the boy.|$|R
2500|$|In {{many of the}} Stooge shorts, the Larry {{character}} {{did more}} reacting than acting, staying {{in the background and}} serving as the voice of reason in contrast to the zany antics of Moe and Curly. [...] He was a surrealistic foil and the middle ground between Moe's gruffly [...] "bossy", and Curly's childish personae. Like the other Stooges, Larry was often {{on the receiving end of}} Moe's abuse. His reasonableness was the perfect foil to Moe's brusque bluntness and Curly or Shemp's boyish immaturity, <b>but</b> <b>Larry</b> would sometimes propose something impossible or illogical and be quickly put down by Moe, both verbally and physically, who would often react by pulling a handful of hair out of Larry's head.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the game}} seemed close {{before the final}} period. [...] Washington took the opening kickoff {{and drove to the}} Cowboys 31-yard line, <b>but</b> <b>Larry</b> Brown lost a fumble there and safety Cliff Harris {{recovered}} the ball. [...] However, Dallas fared no better, and ended up running just six plays in the entire quarter. [...] Following a punt, Washington scored on a 13-play, 9-minute drive, with Brown rushing for 31 yards and catching a pass for 9. Curt Knight finished the drive with an 18-yard field goal in the second quarter. Later on, Redskins quarterback Billy Kilmer smoked the Cowboys with a 51-yard completion to Taylor, and eventually scored on a 15-yard touchdown pass to Taylor that gave his team a 10–0 lead. [...] Near the end of the half, Dallas quarterback Roger Staubach's 29-yard run set up a Toni Fritsch field goal from 35 yards, cutting the score to 10–3. [...] Fritsch later got another attempt on the last play before halftime, but missed a 23-yard attempt, his first miss of the season from under 30 yards.|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately, Dallas and Arden's {{marriage}} isn't a success.

60|$|There was discussion, <b>but</b> <b>Larry</b> sat still, {{saying nothing}} further, with a curious gravity in his face, until a man stood up again.|$|E

60|$|It {{was easy}} to see that Peter Slade was a good skater, and with hardly an effort he went to the front during {{the first quarter of the}} race. <b>But</b> then <b>Larry</b> and Dick began to push him, and when the mile turn was made <b>Larry</b> was <b>but</b> two yards in the rear, with Dick almost on his heels.|$|R
