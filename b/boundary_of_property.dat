50|$|After {{purchasing}} the property, the Kings {{discovered that the}} fences did not accurately represent the true legal boundary, with the southern boundary fence being 3.5 meters outside the legal <b>boundary</b> <b>of</b> the <b>property,</b> something the Wilkinsons would have been aware of, as four years earlier, they had subdivided the section and so knew the true <b>boundaries</b> <b>of</b> the <b>property.</b>|$|R

25|$|Examples of maps {{from ancient}} Egypt are quite rare. However, {{those that have}} survived show an {{emphasis}} on geometry and well-developed surveying techniques, perhaps stimulated {{by the need to}} re-establish the exact <b>boundaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> after the annual Nile floods. The Turin Papyrus Map, dated c. 1160 BC, shows the mountains east of the Nile where gold and silver were mined, along with the location of the miners' shelters, wells, and the road network that linked the region with the mainland. Its originality {{can be seen in the}} map's inscriptions, its precise orientation, and the use of colour.|$|R

50|$|The Provincial Fisheries Reference was {{a lawsuit}} decided in 1898 by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC). It arose from a {{government}} turf war in Canada over the jurisdictional <b>boundaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights {{in relation to}} rivers, lakes, harbours, fisheries, and other cognate subjects. The 12-page judgment was delivered by Lord Hershell, and followed on from R v Robertson (1882). This one case in the JCPC was in reality an amalgamation of three separate Supreme Court of Canada appeals, which were grouped into one because of their similarities. The judgment broke little ground, and {{can be considered a}} ringing affirmation of the Strong court.|$|R

40|$|Let Yk be {{the family}} of {{hereditary}} classes of graphs defined by k forbidden induced subgraphs. In Korpelainen and Lozin (Discrete Math 311 : 1813 – 1822, 2011), it was shown that Y 2 contains only finitely many minimal classes that are not well-quasi-ordered (wqo) by the induced subgraph relation. This implies, in particular, {{that the problem of}} deciding whether a class from Y 2 is wqo or not admits an efficient solution. Unfortunately, this idea does not work for k[*]≥[*] 3, as we show in the present paper. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce the notion <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> well-quasi-ordered sets of graphs. The importance of this notion {{is due to the fact}} that for each k, a class from Yk is wqo if and only if it contains none <b>of</b> the <b>boundary</b> <b>properties.</b> We show that the number <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>properties</b> is generally infinite.
