5|$|HIT may be {{suspected}} if {{blood tests}} show a falling platelet count in someone receiving heparin, {{even if the}} heparin has already been discontinued. Professional guidelines recommend that people receiving heparin have a complete <b>blood</b> <b>count</b> (which includes a platelet count) {{on a regular basis}} while receiving heparin.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the above, blood samples are usually taken to measure urea and creatinine (measures of kidney function, which may be impaired in DKA {{as a result of}} dehydration) and electrolytes. Furthermore, markers of infection (complete <b>blood</b> <b>count,</b> C-reactive protein) and acute pancreatitis (amylase and lipase) may be measured. Given the need to exclude infection, chest radiography and urinalysis are usually performed.|$|E
5|$|Mitoxantrone therapy may be {{associated}} with immunosuppressive effects and liver damage; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related cardiac toxicity. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an echocardiogram and a complete <b>blood</b> <b>count</b> before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, infection or liver dysfunction during therapy.|$|E
2500|$|A drop in <b>blood</b> <b>counts</b> {{is usually}} seen {{during the first}} one to two months of treatment. [...] Most {{patients}} find that their <b>blood</b> <b>counts</b> get worse for a few weeks immediately after starting treatment, although some patients find their <b>blood</b> <b>counts</b> begin to improve within just two weeks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>counts</b> {{of various}} types {{have been used for}} {{clinical}} purposes since the 19th century. Automated equipment to carry out complete <b>blood</b> <b>counts</b> was developed in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Low <b>blood</b> <b>counts,</b> or myelosuppression, occur about 50% of {{the time}} with ABVD. Blood cell growth factors are {{sometimes}} used to prevent this (see Supportive care below). <b>Blood</b> <b>counts</b> are checked frequently while receiving chemotherapy. Any fever or sign of infection that develops needs to be promptly evaluated; severe infections can develop rapidly in {{a person with a}} low white <b>blood</b> cell <b>count</b> due to chemotherapy.|$|R
5|$|Other {{blood tests}} are often taken to help {{understand}} a person's general health and risk {{factors that may}} contribute to heart disease. These often include a full <b>blood</b> <b>count</b> investigating for anaemia, and basic metabolic panel that may reveal any disturbances in electrolytes. A coagulation screen is often required {{to ensure that the}} right level of anticoagulation is given. Fasting lipids and fasting blood glucose (or an HbA1c level) are often ordered to evaluate a person's cholesterol and diabetes status, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Tests for thrombophilia include {{complete}} <b>blood</b> <b>count</b> (with {{examination of}} the blood film), prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, thrombodynamics test, thrombin time and reptilase time, lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibody, anti-β2 glycoprotein 1 antibody, activated protein C resistance, fibrinogen tests, factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation, and basal homocysteine levels. Testing may {{be more or less}} extensive depending on clinical judgement and abnormalities detected on initial evaluation.|$|E
5|$|The first clue to a {{diagnosis}} of AML is typically an abnormal result on a complete <b>blood</b> <b>count.</b> While an excess of abnormal white blood cells (leukocytosis) is a common finding with the leukemia, and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen, AML can also present with isolated decreases in platelets, red blood cells, or even with a low {{white blood cell count}} (leukopenia). While a presumptive diagnosis of AML can be made by examination of the peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts, a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as ruling out pernicious anemia (Vitamin B12 deficiency), folic acid deficiency and copper deficiency.|$|E
50|$|Azacitidine causes anemia (low red <b>blood</b> cell <b>counts),</b> {{neutropenia}} (low white <b>blood</b> cell <b>counts),</b> and thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts), {{and patients}} should have frequent monitoring of their complete <b>blood</b> <b>counts,</b> at least prior to each dosing cycle. The dose {{may have to}} be adjusted based on nadir counts and hematologic response.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the predictive value of peripheral eosinophil and monocyte <b>blood</b> <b>counts</b> regarding lung function in smokers and non-smokers, and to investigate the influence of smoking on these cell counts. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) measurements and blood samples were collected from 298 non-atopic smokers and 136 never-smokers. Blood samples were repeated in 160 smokers after cessation of smoking (quitters) and 30 continuing smokers, 2, 6, 12 and 26 weeks after smoking cessation. Monocyte (P< 0 · 05) but not eosinophil <b>blood</b> <b>counts</b> were higher in never-smokers compared to smokers. In never-smokers, <b>blood</b> eosinophil <b>counts</b> and monocyte counts correlated inversely (P< 0 · 05) and directly (P< 0 · 01), respectively, with standardized FEV 1 residuals (FEVR). In smokers, blood eosinophil (P< 0 · 05) and monocyte (P< 0 · 05) counts correlated directly with FEVR independent of smoking history. After smoking cessation, monocyte <b>blood</b> <b>counts</b> (P< 0 · 05) increased. Both eosinophil and monocyte <b>blood</b> <b>counts</b> showed a greater increase in quitters with decreased lung function (P< 0 · 05). Former heavy smokers had higher blood eosinophil (P< 0 · 05) but lower monocyte (P< 0 · 05) count increase than had former light smokers. These data suggest that smoking influences eosinophil and monocyte <b>blood</b> <b>counts</b> and that this is associated with a small negative effect on lung function. Eosinophil <b>blood</b> <b>counts</b> had an opposite relation to lung function in smokers and non-smokers. Further research should include investigations of relations between smoking and stimulatory factors for recruitment and activity of eosinophils and monocytes...|$|R

5|$|Treatment {{is mainly}} supportive; gastric {{decontamination}} with activated charcoal {{may be beneficial}} if medical attention is sought {{within a few hours}} of consumption. However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, urinalysis, and complete <b>blood</b> <b>count</b> is undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. Dialysis can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys are failing. Hemolysis may require a blood transfusion to replace the lost red blood cells, while methemoglobinemia is treated with intravenous methylene blue.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of HHT is {{symptomatic}} (it {{deals with}} the symptoms rather than the disease itself), {{as there is no}} therapy that stops the development of telangiectasias and AVMs directly. Furthermore, some treatments are applied to prevent the development of common complications. Chronic nosebleeds and digestive tract bleeding can both lead to anemia; if the bleeding itself cannot be completely stopped, the anemia requires treatment with iron supplements. Those who cannot tolerate iron tablets or solutions may require administration of intravenous iron, and blood transfusion if the anemia is causing severe symptoms that warrant rapid improvement of the <b>blood</b> <b>count.</b>|$|E
5|$|In general, in adults, {{investigations}} are not needed in mild cases. There {{is a very}} low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal. In persons requiring hospitalization, pulse oximetry, chest radiography and blood tests—including a complete <b>blood</b> <b>count,</b> serum electrolytes, C-reactive protein level, and possibly liver function tests—are recommended. Procalcitonin may help determine the cause and support who should receive antibiotics. Countries with the greatest burden of disease include India (43million), China (21million) and Pakistan (10million). It {{is the leading cause}} of death among children in low income countries. Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia. Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented, as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available. In 2011, pneumonia was the most common reason for admission to the hospital after an emergency department visit in the U.S. for infants and children.|$|E
