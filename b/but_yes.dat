Sotomayor does not belong to a Catholic parish or attend Mass, but does attend church for important occasions. She has said, [...] "I am a very spiritual person [...] maybe not traditionally religious in terms of Sunday Mass every week, that sort of thing.

500|$|After Winehouse's death, {{according}} to Pete Doherty, he and Winehouse were lovers at one point, {{speaking to the}} Daily Mail about it he said [...] "This is {{difficult for me to}} admit. <b>But,</b> <b>yes,</b> it's true. Amy and I were lovers. I loved her then and, well, I still do today. But towards the end, as only lovers can, she became quite mean and cruel to me. She didn't suffer fools… and believe me, she had a mean right hook." [...] However, in July 2008, Rolling Stone reporter Claire Hoffman asked Winehouse about her relationship with Doherty. Winehouse replied: [...] "We're just good friends", and added: [...] "I asked Pete to do a concept EP, and he made this face, he looked at me like I'd pooed on the floor. He wouldn't do it. We're just really close".|$|E
500|$|James Whale {{lived as}} an openly gay man {{throughout}} {{his career in the}} British theatre and in Hollywood, something that was virtually unheard of in the 1920s and 1930s. He and David Lewis lived together as a couple from around 1930 to 1952. While he did not go {{out of his way to}} publicize his homosexuality, he did not do anything to conceal it either. As filmmaker Curtis Harrington, a friend and confidant of Whale's, put it, [...] "Not in the sense of screaming it from the rooftops or coming out. <b>But</b> <b>yes,</b> he was openly homosexual. Any sophisticated person who knew him knew he was gay." [...] While there have been suggestions that Whale's career was terminated because of homophobia, and Whale was supposedly dubbed [...] "The Queen of Hollywood", Harrington states that [...] "nobody made a thing out of it as far as I could perceive".|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs {{was more}} negative, giving the episode a C− rating and criticizing the two plots {{and the lack}} of good jokes. He wrote that while there was [...] "some comic potential" [...] in the premise, the writers failed to deliver funny material. Commenting on the plot with Homer and Roz, Childs {{explained}} that [...] "there’s some comic possibility and resonance in having Homer stabbed in the back at work. Many people have been stabbed in the back by an ambitious colleague. Unfortunately, Homer {{may not be the best}} character to give this sort of storyline a heart. Homer is a bad employee who deserves to be ratted out by his subordinate. The fact that she is selfish and mean doesn’t add to this story. Yes, that is the sort of person who would stab someone in the back for their own gain, <b>but</b> <b>yes,</b> Homer also had it coming. Where is the joke?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. <b>But</b> <b>yes,</b> we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

On the possibility of writing anymore books in the future Clarkson told Publishers Weekly, [...] "I've got a few ideas – there could be a lullaby for each book. We've got a plethora of stories, and I've already written seven songs, full out, so we'll just have to see which ones might pan out to be a book. <b>But</b> <b>yes,</b> there will definitely be more."

One of Sanders' {{responsibilities}} was to gather evidence by interviewing officials and aides {{to find out more}} information about the Watergate break-in. The most famous of these interviews occurred on Friday, July 13, 1973. Alexander Butterfield (Federal Aviation Administration head and a former White House aide) was being privately questioned by Senate committee staff members, when Sanders asked if it were possible that a recording system had been used in the White House. Butterfield answered: [...] "I wish you hadn't asked that question, <b>but,</b> <b>yes,</b> there is." [...] Sanders went to relay the news to Fred Thompson, who was the Minority Counsel. Sanders first had to call him out of a local restaurant.
