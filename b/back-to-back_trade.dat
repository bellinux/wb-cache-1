As an important implication, we have also studied the situation where the investor enters an offsetting <b>back-to-back</b> <b>trade</b> with another counter party. We have provided simple numerical examples to demonstrate the change of a fair CDS premium according to the strength of default dependence among the relevant names, and then discussed its possible implications for the risk management of the central counter parties. ...|$|E
