40|$|Following {{the passage}} of the Waxman-Hatch Act (1984), FDA {{approval}} for a generic drug requires the establishment of <b>bio-equivalence</b> between the generic drug and an FDA approved branded drug. However, a large body of evidence in the medical community suggests that <b>bio-equivalence</b> does not guarantee therapeutic equivalence; in some instances the lack of therapeutic equivalence can lead to fatal consequences for patients switching to generic products. In this paper, we construct a simple model to analyze the implications of therapeutic non-equivalence between branded and generic drugs.

MethodsDocumentary reviews supplemented by interviews with senior policymakers of relevant public health authorities. ResultsDrug regulatory authorities {{play a vital role}} in the market authorization process by considering evidence on safety, efficacy and quality for new medicines, and <b>bio-equivalence</b> for new generic products of previously patented medicines. For the formulation of the reimbursement list, all three cases applied evidence on cost-effectiveness, to various degrees, with clear institutional structure, capacity, and functions. Only Thailand has specified an explicit benchmark on cost-effectiveness for inclusion in the reimbursement list. For price control, all have established mechanisms and processes for price negotiation. These mechanisms apply evidence on cost structure and relative prices in other countries to ensure affordable prices, especially with the patented drug industry. Thailand's universal insurance schemes use a capitation payment model which proves effective in implicit price control.

40|$|The {{roots of}} Pueraria lobata (Wild.) Ohwi and Pueraria thomsonii Benth have been officially {{recorded}} in all editions of Chinese Pharmacopoeia {{under the same}} monograph ‘Gegen’ (Radix Puerariae, RP). However, in its 2005 edition, the two species were separated into both individual monographs, namely ‘Gegen’ (Radix Puerariae Lobatae, RPL) and ‘Fenge’ (Radix Puerariae Thomsonii, RPT), respectively, due to their obvious content discrepancy of puerarin, the major active constituent. In present paper, the fingerprint of high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) combining digital scanning profiling was developed to identify and distinguish the both species in detail. The unique properties of the HPTLC fingerprints were validated by analyzing ten batches of Pueraria lobata and P. thomsonii samples, respectively. The common pattern of the HPTLC images of the roots of Pueraria spp. and the respective different ratios of the chemical distribution can directly discern the two species. The corresponding digital scanning profiles provided an easy way for quantifiable comparison among the samples. Obvious difference in ingredient content and HPTLC patterns of the two species questioned their <b>bio-equivalence</b> and explained that recording both species separately in the current edition of Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2005 edition) is reasonable due to not only the content of major constituent, puerarin, but also the peak-to-peak distribution in the fingerprint and integration value of the total components. Furthermore, the HPTLC fingerprint is also suitable for rapid and simple authentication and comparison of the subtle difference among samples with identical plant resource but different geographic locations.

40|$|AbstractA {{simple and}} rapid stability-indicating LC-analytical method was {{developed}} for the simultaneous determination of flucloxacillin (fluc) and amoxicillin (amox) in bulk and pharmaceutical dosage form. A chromatographic separation of the two drugs was achieved with a Thermosil C 18 (4. 6 mm× 250 mm, 5 μm) analytical column using potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (adjusted to pH 3 by ortho phosphoric acid) :methanol (70 : 30 %, v/v) in isocratic mode at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and column at ambient temperature. The detection was monitored at 225 nm using a PDA detector. The stressed samples were analyzed for the degradation study in acid, base, peroxide, thermal, photolytic and validated as per ICH guideline. This proposed method {{was found to be}} specific and stability-indicating as no interfering peaks of degradation compounds and excipients were noticed. The described method shows excellent linearity over a range of 20 – 100 μg/mL for both drugs. The correlation coefficient for fluc and amox was 0. 9992 and 0. 9993, respectively. The mean recovery value for fluc and amox was 99. 9 % and 99. 7 %, respectively. The limit of detection for fluc and amox was 0. 018 and 0. 009 μg/mL and the limit of quantification was 0. 06 and 0. 03 μg/mL, respectively. The retention time was observed at 2. 582 and 3. 407 min for amox and fluc, respectively.

Each treatment period was 30 days with a 7 - 14 days washout period between them. On Days 1 and 30 of each treatment period blood was sampled at - 15, - 5 min, 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 16 h post study drug administration. Sixteen men with established androgen deficiency aged between 29 and 73 years, who had undertaken a washout from prior testosterone therapy participated in the study. One subject failed to complete both arms and another was excluded post-completion because of a major protocol violation. Bioequivalence was established based on key pharmacokinetic (PK) variables: AUC, C(avg), C(max), T(max), % fluctuation (with and without baseline correction) for the two formulations of testosterone on Day 1 and Day 30. The ratio and 90 % CI of AUC 0. 99 (0. 86 - 1. 14), C(max) 1. 02 (0. 84 - 1. 24) and C(avg) 0. 99 (0. 86 - 1. 14) for T cream/T gel were within the predetermined <b>bio-equivalence</b> criteria of 80 % to 125 % at Day 30.

Most of them rely on the Gene Ontology or similar biological annotation databases to perform some variation Gene Enrichment Analysis (GEA) or the more recent Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA, [1]). A type of analysis whose interest is obvious is comparing several lists of genes. This can be interesting “per se ” or be the basis for the comparison or the combination of several experi-ments. In a previous study [3] we developed a framework {{for the analysis}} of lists of genes which consists of projecting them into an extended level of the GO, creating “expanded functional pro-files ” and using a multinomial model {{as the basis for the}} analysis. The main characteristic of this approach is that it is performed on all categories at once instead of being done on a category– by–category basis. Once the method has been established and tested the issue has appeared that, in fact, the main interest in many analyses is in establishing the hypothesis of similarity between two lists. In consequence it seems reasonable to adopt a <b>bio–equivalence</b> point of view instead of the classical hypothesis tests setting, designed to reject a null hypothesis of equality. We present an equivalence method which uses a distance–based approach and the confidence interval inclusion principle.

Since that time, manufacturers of generic drugs have grown from small, shoestring operations to include some of the world’s largest corporations, and laws mandating the interchangeability of generic and brand-name medications have become the norm. Now, generic drugs account for three-quarters or more of all prescriptions filled, but only about 20 % of spending on pharmaceuticals. Generic drugs have well-described health benefits, as patients prescribed lower-cost generic drugs are more likely to adhere to their treatment regimens. 1 Despite the steady growth of the market for generic drugs, skepticism regarding their use has persisted. Accounts expressing uncertainty usually emphasize the possibility that differences might exist between brand-name and generic drugs that could lead to idiosyncratic adverse effects or sys-tematic differences in drug efficacy. The basis for such concerns is the concept of “bio equivalence. ” Generic drugs are approved by national regulatory bodies, such as Health Canada and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), based on proof of similarity to their brand-name counterparts in pharmacodynamic studies — similarities in para-meters such as maximum serum concentration and time to maximum concentration. Most regula-tory bodies require bioequivalence parameters to fall within a 25 % window, meaning that one gen-eric version could conceivably have 80 % <b>bio-equivalence</b> to the reference product, whereas another could have 125 % bioequivalence. Is bioequivalence sufficient from a clinical point of view? In the medical literature, case stud-ies have reported instances in which patients have had adverse outcomes related to the use of generic in place of brand-name formulations, 2 leading many editorialists to warn against substitution. 3 Most of these physicians express particular con-cern over drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, such as antiepileptic drugs, immunosuppressive agents, anticoagulant agents and antiarrhythmic products such as digoxin and amiodarone.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. For {{a drug to}} have a {{therapeutic}} effect, it has to reach its site of action in sufficient quantities. The Pheroid drug delivery system enhances the absorption of drugs in various pharmacological categories and {{is the focus of}} this study. A number of patents are registered in various countries to protect its application. Pheroid technology is trademarked, but may for ease of reading, be called Pheroid(s) only. The Pheroid itself is composed of an organic carbon backbone composed of unsaturated fatty acids with some side-chain interactions that result in self-emulsifying characteristics. The resulting vesicles and nano-sponges can entrap hydrophilic, hydrophobic or amphiphilic compounds for biomedical and agricultural application and can be manipulated as to loading ability, mechanical resistance, permeability, size and solubility. Pheroid was investigated for its potential use in the areas of vaccines, peptide drugs, topical products and cosmeceuticals, antimicrobial treatments and agriculture. In all of these areas, the Pheroid has indeed shown applicability: the results showed improved uptake and/or efficacy of the entrapped chemical or biological compounds after administration by a number of administration routes. For oral administration, a precursor format, the pro-Pheroid, was used, wherein the vesicles and/or sponges are formed post-administration. Proof of concept studies on the in vivo absorption and bioavailability, as well as studies on in vitro efficacy of Pheroid-based formulations were carried out for antimicrobials, such as tuberculosis drugs, antimalarials and antiretrovirals. In all cases, the in vitro efficacy of the active compounds was increased, compared to well-known standard drug treatments. In a phase I <b>bio-equivalence</b> study, a Pheroid-containing combination formulation was compared against the comparative market leader. The results demonstrated that the bioavailability of the active compounds in the Pheroid was at least as good but mostly significantly better than that of the comparative medication. In addition, the incidence of side-effects was decreased {{in the case of the}} Pheroid formulations. Furthermore, in vitro results indicate that drug resistance can at least partially be negated. Pheroid technology may also be capable of protecting labile drugs such as peptides against degradation and increasing efficacy so that lower dosages can be administered less frequently and with fewer side effects. Based on in vitro and in vivo results, a number of products are currently in development. The application of Pheroid technology is potentially limitless and includes such areas as TB, malaria, cancer, AIDS, gene delivery, vaccines, patented medicines and generics and agriculture.

40|$|Background: Tramadol {{is a well}} tolerated and {{effective}} analgesic used to treat moderate to severe pain. Several generic formulations of tramadol are available in Brazil; however, published information regarding their bioequivalence in the Brazilian population is not available. A study was designed for Brazilian regulatory authorities to allow marketing of a generic formulation. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the bioequivalence of 2 commercial tablet preparations containing tramadol 100 mg marketed for use in Brazil. Methods: A randomized, open-label, 2 x 2 crossover study was performed in healthy Brazilian volunteers under fasting conditions with a washout period of 12 days. Two tablet formulations of tramadol 100 mg (test and reference formulations) were administered as a single oral dose, and blood samples were collected over 24 hours. Tramadol plasma concentrations were quantified using a validated HPLC method. A plasma concentration time profile was generated for each volunteer and then mean values were determined, from which C(max), T(max), AUC(0 -t), AUC(0 -infinity), k(e), and t(1 / 2) were calculated using a noncompartmental model. Bioequivalence between the products was determined by calculating 90 % CIs for the ratios of C(max), AUC(0 -t), and AUC(0 -infinity) values for the test and reference products using log-transformed data. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate), laboratory tests (hematology, blood biochemistry, hepatic function, urinalysis), and interviews with the volunteers before medication administration and every 2 hours during the study. Results: Twenty-six healthy volunteers (13 men, 13 women) were enrolled in and completed the study. Mean (SD) age was 30 (6. 8) years (range, 21 - 44 years), mean weight was 64 (8. 3) kg (range, 53 - 79 kg), and mean height was 166 (6. 4) cm (range, 155 - 178 cm). The 90 % CIs for the ratios of C(max) (1. 01 - 1. 17), AUC(0 -t) (1. 00 - 1. 13), and AUC(0 -infinity) (1. 00 - 1. 14) values for the test and reference products fell within the interval of 0. 80 to 1. 25 proposed by most regulatory agencies, including the Brazilian regulatory body. No clinically important adverse effects were reported; only mild somnolence was reported by 4 volunteers and mild headaches by 5 volunteers, and there was no need to use medication to treat these symptoms.

Analysis of new controlled release oral drug delivery systems using, C 8 (Eurosphere- 100 (5 µm) 4. 6 mm ID x 250 mm) and C 18 (Eurosphere- 100 (5 µm) 4 mm ID x 100 mm) columns was carried out. The mobile phase was phosphate buffer/methanol. Spectrophotometric detection was at 272 nm. Percentages of content for the different matrices were evaluated. Based on t-test no significantdifference was found between content measurements using C 8 and C 18 columns at p′-value of 0. 05. (Observed t-value was 0. 062 compared to the theoretical value of 2. 15. Content analysis showed good precision and accuracy with C 8 rather than C 18. In vivo performance and <b>bio-equivalence</b> of controlled release matrix tablets (MT 33) containing gum Arabic and Guar gum was compared to a standard control drug Voltaren retard in healthy male volunteers. The study design was randomized cross-over study. Blood samples were collected at pre-determined periods, up to 12 hours and one sample was taken after 24 hours. High performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis was done for both sample and control. Parameters such as Cmax,Tmax, AUC 0 - 24, iii Keland MRT 0 - 24. AUMC 0 -t, AUMC 0 -∞were obtained. The bioequivalence of both formulationswas evaluated which showed no difference in prolonged action in vivo performance between controlled matrix tablets (MT 33) containing gum Arabic and guar gum compared to a standard control drug; Voltaren retard in healthy volunteers. Accelerated stability study for six months was performed for controlled release matrix tablets (MT 20, MT 33, MT 34, MT 33 p, MT 34 p) containing natural gums (gum Arabic, guar gum), semi-synthetic gum (Xanthan gum), Eudragit L 100 (methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate), and Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. Microbiological tests for matrices were evaluated by comparing preserved and non preserved tablets. Content {{was found to be}} 90 - 105 % in all the five matrix formulae. Applying out of trend stability rules (OOT), the best formula was MT 33 which contain guar gum 15 % and gum Arabic 15 %. No changes in physical appearance and organoleptic properties were observed. No microbiological growth (bacteria or fungi) was observed in both preserved and non-preserved controlled release formulae...|$|E
40|$|Phytosterols {{and their}} glucosides (sterolins) have many {{therapeutic}} indications e. g. immune modulation, hypercholesterolaemia and {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} (BPH). In this study sterolslsterolins in three BPH phytotherapeutics (Hypoxis hemerocallidea, Prunus africana and Serenoa repens) and related products were investigated. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop, evaluate and apply TLC and HPLC methods for the qualitative and quantitative analyses of sterols and sterolins. A new optimum TLC method was developed for good visibility and separation of phytosterols and sterolins and could be used to qualitatively compare sterol/sterolin content. A published HPLC method to determine the bioavailability of β-sitosterol in humans was used in a new application to quantitatively determine phytosterols in plant extracts. A new and sensitive method to determine hypoxoside (norlignan diglucoside unique to Hypoxidaceae), by isolation from the crude methanol extract with solid phase extraction (SPE) and HPLC quantification using fluorescence detection (excitation wavelength of 230 nm and emission wavelength of 345 nm), was developed. The developed TLC and adapted HPLC methods were applied to determine the stability of phytosterols, subjected to increased temperature and gamma irradiation. Phytosterols in isolated form were more stable than the phytosterols in plant material. The data from the accelerated stability tests could be used to estimate the shelf-lives of the BPH phytotherapeutics and related sterol containing products. The HPLC method to determine β-sitosterol in serum, was evaluated during a pilot study of a clinical trial, to test the <b>bio-equivalence</b> of different phytosterol containing products. The method was found not sensitive enough to determine β-sitosterol in serum, notwithstanding improvements made, Le. changing the extraction ratio; experimenting with higher dosages, and different products. As result, the proposed clinical trial could not be performed, in the future, serum could rather be analysed by gas chromatographic methods. TLC and HPLC analyses of medicinal African potato tea, indicated that it contained hypoxoside, but not β-sitosterol or β-sitosterolin. β-Sitosterol (accepted to be the active of H. hemerocallidea) might not be the main active in African potato tea. Hypoxoside and a compound (red spot compound), noticed on TLC plates of acetone extracts of Prunus africana, Serenoa repens, Moducare®, Harzol®, Immunochoice® and Nutricare®, were extracted with water. This general presence of the red spot compound could point to a possible important function. Preparative TLC was unsuccessful to isolate the red spot compound, but column chromagraphy was successfully applied. From the proton and carbon NMR spectra, it was concluded, that the compound was definitely not a steroid and could either be a coumarin or an isoflavanoid, with a sugar unit (possibly a rhamose) attached to it. Further analyses to elucidate the structure failed due to decomposition of the compound. Further work on structure elucidation is required and possible therapeutic activity should also be investigated. The sterols and sterolins in H. hemerocallidea and related herbal medicine can be qualitatively and quantitatively analysed with the developed TLC and adapted HPLC methods. This provides natural medicine industry with necessary procedures to ensure proper quality, safety and stability. Dissertation (MSc (Pharmacology)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

A generic medicine is amedicinal product {{with the same}} qualitative and quantitative composition inactive substances and the same pharmaceutical form as the reference medicinalproduct (originator product), and whose <b>bio-equivalence</b> with the referencemedicinal product has been demonstrated by appropriate bio-availability studies. They possess that same quality, safety and efficacy compared to originatormedicines at prices {{which tend to be}} 20 - 80 % lower than their originatorequivalents. Part 1 of this project, the GeneralIntroduction, provides the definitions related to generic medicines andpresents an overview of the substantial savings which countries have obtainedthrough the use of them. Governments can implement a variety of policies toincrease the use of generic medicines, on both the supply- and the demand-side,which are described in Part 2 and Part 3. Studies on the supply-side have beenreported in Part 2. An overview of the regulatory framework regarding marketaccess of generic medicines in the European Union is provided in Chapter 2. 1. Hurdles which delay marketaccess of generic medicines are listed: defensive patenting strategies; patentlitigations; patent linkage and third-party interventions during the process ofobtaining marketing authorization and pricing and reimbursement decisions; andbacklogs in national approval systems are well-documented causes for delayedmarket access of generic medicines. A list of recommendations to enhance marketaccess of generic medicines in the European Union round off this chapter (e. g. theestablishment of a unitary European Union patent and a unified and specialisedpatent litigation system at European level; automatic approval of pricing andreimbursement decisions upon marketing authorization; and a reduction ofbacklogs in national agencies). Chapter 2. 2 describes the current status and impact ofgeneric medicine pricing policies in Europe. Competition from Indian genericmedicine manufacturers, European variation in generic medicine prices andcompetition between generic medicine manufacturers by discount suggest that thepotential savings from generic medicines to health care payers and patients arenot fully realized in Europe. One solution might be to move away fromcompetition by discount to competition by price. Free-pricing systems may drivemedicine prices downwards under specific conditions. In price-regulatedsystems, regulation may lower prices of both originator and generic medicines,but it may also remove incentives for additional price reductions beyond thoseimposed by regulation. The European experience suggests that there is not asingle approach towards developing generic medicine pricing policies in Europe. A relationship between the market share ofgeneric medicines and the change of the price level of medicines in off-patentmarkets was demonstrated in Chapter 2. 3. Market volumes increased in both high and low generic market share countries. Market values, on the other hand, decreased substantially in high genericmarket share countries while the decrease in low generic market share countrieswas limited. Medicine prices in high generic market share countries decreasedsubsequently more than prices in low generic market share countries. A survey was designed to assess thefeatures of tendering programs for outpatient prescription pharmaceuticals inEuropean countries, as described in Chapter 2. 4. Tendering is the acquisition of pharmaceuticals based on a competitivebidding process where the contract is granted to the pharmaceutical supplierswho offered the best bid following strict criteria. Only seven Europeancountries had adopted tendering programs for pharmaceuticals in ambulatory carein 2011. Tendering was more popular in countries with a mature genericmedicines market than in countries with a developing generic medicines market. A legal basis, criteria to grant the tender, the number of winners and theduration of the tender were amongst the crucial features for the programs towork. Some countries have achieved short-term savings on their pharmaceuticalbudgets, which was the main objective of tendering. There are however someproblems allied with the policy and the effects in the long term are stillunclear. An analysis of the impact of referencepricing systems in Europe rounds off Part 2, as described in Chapter 2. 5. A reference pricing systemestablishes a common reimbursement level or reference price for a group ofinterchangeable medicines, i. e. the reference group. Many European governmentshave introduced a reference pricing system to contain pharmaceuticalexpenditures by controlling the level of reimbursement. Reference pricingdrives down prices of drugs subject to it, but not always below the referenceprice. The use of medicines priced at or below the reference price increased andsavings on pharmaceutical expenditure were generated, albeit that they tend tobe limited to the short term. The long-term growth of drug expenditure did notseem to have reduced by reference pricing. No negative effect on healthoutcomes of patients was observed. Part 3 groups studies which have beenperformed on different aspects of the demand-side. Chapter 3. 1 provides a general overview of demand-side policieswhich have been implemented by European governments to encourage the use ofgeneric medicines. A plethora of different demand-side policies has alreadybeen initiated by different authorities, thereby targeting physicians,pharmacists and patients. The results have shown that positive knowledge andperceptions of generic medicines by physicians, pharmacists and patients arenecessary prerequisites to increase the use of generic medicines. Governmentsmust subsequently initiate appropriate policies to achieve this (e. g. academicdetailing programs and continuous medical education events for physicians andpharmacists and media campaigns for all stakeholders). These policies should becombined with policies to increase all stakeholders financial responsibilityto the healthcare system and policies to facilitate the prescribing anddispensing of generic medicines. Belgium has implemented a policy in 2006 whichobliges physicians to prescribe minimum quota of cheap medicines, as describedin Chapter 3. 2. All groups ofgeneral practitioners, specialists and dentists reached their minimumpercentages yearly from 2006 until 2009. The percentage of cheap medicines (indefined daily doses) increased from 22. 9 % in January 2005 to 44. 2 % of allprescribed medicines in ambulatory care in December 2009. The percentage ofgeneric medicines increased from 12. 10 % in 2004 to 24. 03 % of all prescribedmedicines in ambulatory care in 2008. The policy of prescribing quota for cheapmedicines was not only associated with an increased prescribing of genericmedicines during 2004 - 2008, but also increased the prescribing of originalmedicines whose price had dropped to the reference price level, as thesemedicines were included in the definition of cheap medicines. The potential forprescribing generic medicines has not yet been fully met in Belgium. Despitethe success of the policy, adjustments are desirable, especially with respectto the broad definition of cheap medicines. Pharmacists {{play an important role in}} thedevelopment of a generic medicines market. It is important that they are not financiallypenalized for dispensing generic medicines, which is currently the case in someEuropean countries, as demonstrated in Chapter 3. 3. Therefore, their remuneration should move towards afee-for-performance remuneration instead of a price-dependent remuneration,which is currently employed in many European countries. A fee-for-performanceremuneration would provide a stimulus for dispensing generic medicines, aspharmacists would not be financially penalized for dispensing them. Chapter 3. 4 rounds off Part 3 with calculations of possiblesavings through an increased use of generic medicines by elderly, as they arethe biggest users of medicines. The analysis showed that these savings wererather limited (4. 48 % when the generic market share by volume increase to 95 %). The full potential of generic medicines in the elderly population has not yetbeen realized in Belgium, due to the limited use of them and their relativehigh prices compared to their originator equivalents. The Belgian governmentshould implement additional incentives for physicians, pharmacists and patientsto increase the use of generics by elderly. These policies should be combinedby policies to lower prices of generic medicines and policies to rationalizethe prescribing of medicines for elderly, which should decrease the volume ofmedicines used by elderly subsequently. An analysis of the Spanish genericmedicines market is provided in Part 4. Spain is a highly decentralized country with 17 Autonomous Communities. Fundingand management of health care services, including pharmaceutical policies, isdecentralized and the responsibility of the regions since January 2002. The useof generic medicines in Spain is low compared to other European countries, bothin volume and value. We have provided an overview of the Spanish genericmedicines market and identified hurdles which impede its development. Recommendations o increase the sustainability of the Spanish generic medicinesmarket are proposed. Recommendations to increase the use of genericmedicines in Europe are proposed in the GeneralDiscussion in Part 5. These suggested policies are likely to work in allcountries throughout Europe, as they are policies which work independently ofthe different country-specific characteristics of health care systems. Theimpact of hospital policies regarding generic medicines is discussed, as thesedecisions may impact the future medication schemes in ambulatory care. Thechanging industrial landscape for pharmaceutical companies, with a tendency to pharmaceuticalcompanies combining both originator and generic divisions and the rise ofbiopharmaceuticals and biosimilars, is also discussed. Future research shouldfocus on the development of generic medicines in emerging markets andcountry-specific analyses of other European countries with limited use ofgeneric medicines. status: publishe...|$|E
