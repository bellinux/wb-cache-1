30|$|It {{analyses}} a three-level hierarchy incorporating at {{the highest}} level a general bipolar happiness vs. unhappiness dimension, an independent positive affect versus negative affect dimension at the second order level below it, and discrete expressivity factors of joy, sadness, hostility, guilt/shame, fear emotions at the base. Similarly, a three-level hierarchical model of affect links the basic factors of affect at different levels of abstraction and integrates previous models into a single scheme. The key to this hierarchical structure is the recognition that the general <b>bipolar</b> <b>factor</b> of happiness and independent dimensions of PA and NA are better viewed as different levels of abstraction within a hierarchical model, rather than as competing models at the same level of abstraction. At the highest level of this model, the general <b>bipolar</b> <b>factor</b> of happiness accounts for the tendency for PA and NA to be moderately negatively correlated. Therefore, the hierarchical model of affect accounted for both the bipolarity of pleasantness-unpleasantness and the independence of PA and NA, effectively resolving a debate that occupied the literature for decades.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this study}} we {{compared}} the impact of promotive and risk factors on 18 -month recidivism during adolescence. We measured <b>bipolar</b> <b>factors</b> (factors with risk and promotive effects being {{the ends of the}} same continuum) for 13, 613 American juveniles who had committed a criminal offense. For most of the factors {{no significant differences were found}} between the impact of the promotive and risk ends. Interventions aimed at increasing promotive factors may therefore be potentially just as effective as interventions aimed at decreasing risks. The importance of both promotive and risk factors was found to be significantly higher for younger than for older adolescents in almost every domain, which emphasizes the importance of early intervention. Furthermore, age and sex differences were found in the impact and prevalence of promotive and risk factors. The discussion focuses on implications for clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{presence}} and impact of dynamic protective factors for delinquency in male adolescents {{with a history of}} sexual and/or violent offending. <b>Bipolar</b> <b>factors</b> (factors with risk and protective factors being the ends of the same continuum) were examined in male adolescents with a history of sexual offenses against younger children (CSOs; n = 341), a history of sexual offenses against peers and/or adult victims (PSOs; n = 207), and a history of nonsexual violent offenses (VOs; n = 1, 356). We conducted secondary analyses on data collected with the Washington State Juvenile Court Assessment and on general recidivism data. ANOVA, correlations, Fisher’s z tests, and logistic regression analyses were applied. Results showed that, in VOs, the number of risk factors was greater than the number of protective factors, whereas in PSOs, and especially CSOs, the number of protective factors was greater than the number of risk factors. Protective factors appeared to be especially important for juveniles with a history of sexual offenses for two reasons. First, the impact of most protective factors on recidivism was larger among juveniles with a history of sexual offenses than among those with a history of violent offenses. Second, protective factors added to the predictive accuracy over and above risk factors in juveniles with a history of sexual offenses, but not in those with a history of violent offenses...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} factor {{analyses}} of mood states, measured {{by means of}} adjective check lists and scales, have been reported since 1955. Green and Nowlis (1957) postulated four <b>bipolar</b> <b>factors</b> but emerged with eight factors for their check list of 140 adjectives. Utilizing 40 adjectives drawn from the longer Nowlis list, Borgatta (1961) isolated seven interpretable factors. Clyde assembled a mood scale which yielded six factors (1963).

40|$|The strongest {{statistical}} {{support for}} the binary view of depression has been provided by factor (principal components) analytic studies which delineate a <b>bipolar</b> <b>factor</b> with features interpreted as reflecting "endogenous depression" and "neurotic depression" at opposing poles. We review the seminal studies to suggest instead that the <b>bipolar</b> <b>factor</b> has generally polarised depression and anxiety, and that no such entity or symptom complex of "neurotic depression" has been isolated. Instead, "neurotic depression" has been defined principally by features of anxiety and personality style. We argue that the suggested entity is, in fact, a pseudo-entity, being {{no more than a}} residual group of non-depressive features without any significant intrinsic depressive characteristics. We support our interpretation by showing comparable solutions in published studies of depressives alone, contrasted with separate analyses of anxious and depressed patients. We also report two studies in which the "neurotic depressive" pole is made to appear and disappear by the inclusion and exclusion of anxiety items. As factor analytic studies have defined the "residual" pole so variably, we argue that some features held to distinguish neurotic depression are of no utility and that such a diagnosis is meaningless. We suggest that the clinician should not proceed (after excluding endogenous depression) to conclude that the default option is necessarily an entity "neurotic depression" and that instead a heterogeneous group of options (e. g. anxiety, personality disorder) require review. If the "neurotic depressive" type of the multivariate analytic studies is a pseudo-entity, then a modified unitary view of depression may be valid...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Parenting Bonding Instrument (PBI) is {{a widely}} used battery to assess {{parenting}} behaviours. Although, it was originally developed to measure two attributes of parenting behaviour, care and overprotection, there is still disagreement about {{the factor structure of}} the scale. The aim of the present study is to examine the fit of different factorial structures of the PBI in a Japanese college sample. A total of 4, 357 Japanese college students (1392 male and 2965 female) participated in the study. The age range was 17 - 40 years old with the mean age of 20. 29 (SD = 1. 85). Based on the previous research, five different models of factor structures were identified, and confirmatory factor analyses using AMOS were performed to evaluate the fit of each factorial structure model. A four-factor model (care, indifference, overprotection, and encouragement of autonomy) yielded the best fit among the five models. It was found that the original two-factor model did not reach the acceptable fit. Although the original scoring instruction indicates the four subscales be treated as two sets of <b>bipolar</b> <b>factors</b> (care-indifference, overprotection-autonomy), the present study suggests that four subscales be treated as independent factors when parenting behaviours are assessed in a Japanese population...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Electrophysiological {{measurements}} of nerve impulse frequencies {{were used to}} explore the organization of taste sensibilities in single fibers of the hamster chorda tympani nerve. Moderately intense taste solutions that are either very similar or easily discriminated were applied to the anterior lingual surface. 40 response profiles or 13 stimulus activation patterns were considered variables and examined with multivariate statistical techniques. Three kinds of response profiles were seen in fibers that varied in their overall sensitivity to taste solutions. One profile (S) showed selectivity for sweeteners, a second (N) showed selectivity for sodium salts, and a third (H) showed sensitivity to salts, acids, and other compounds. Hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that profiles fell into discrete classes. Responses to many pairs of effective stimuli were covariant across profiles within a class, but some acidic stimuli had more idiosyncratic effects. Factor analysis of profiles identified two common factors, accounting for 77 % of the variance. A unipolar factor was identified with the N profile, and a <b>bipolar</b> <b>factor</b> was identified with the S profile and its opposite, the H profile.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the relationship between aesthetic experience and other emotional qualities judged in paintings. Aesthetic experience was defined as an exceptional state of mind {{in which a person}} is focused on a particular object, transcending its everyday uses and meanings and losing the awareness of surroundings and even of himself/herself. In this state a person has an exceptional emotional experience, that is a feeling of unity with the object. Our basic idea is that aesthetic experience is not reducible to pleasure or a positive hedonic tone, but a person can equally be fascinated with both pleasant and unpleasant objects. In preliminary studies we specified the stimulus set of figural and semi-figural paintings, and a set of descriptors of emotions, feelings and aesthetic experience. Participants judged the paintings on descriptors (seven-point scales). Factor analysis revealed two large factors: the <b>bipolar</b> <b>factor</b> Affective Tone (descriptors on the positive pole: lovely, charming, cheerful, etc; descriptors on the negative pole: scary, disgusting, hateful etc.) and Aesthetic Experience (descriptors: exceptional, profound, unique, etc.).

The variables of social-emotional functioning measured in this study were achievement motivation, the child" s sense of competence, and a two-factor model of social-emotional functioning, namely Interest-Participaticn versus ApathyWithdrawal, and Cocperation- Goipliance versus Anger-Defiance. These variables were assessed in the final year of nursery school. The achievement criteria measured in Grade I were Reading, Arithmetic, Vocabulary and Position in Class, while in Grade II Reading and Arithmetic were. All of the above variables were measured by formal psychometric tests or teacher rating scales. Finally, when the subjects were in nursery school, their intelligence was assessed by the Gcodenough Draw-A-Man test, and only those subjects who vrere within the normal range of intelligence were retained in the study.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{introduces}} eight comic styles (i. e., fun, humor, nonsense, wit, irony, satire, sarcasm, and cynicism) and examines {{the validity of}} a set of 48 marker items for their assessment, the Comic Style Markers (CSM). These styles were originally developed to describe literary work and are used here to describe individual differences. Study 1 examines whether the eight styles can be distinguished empirically, in self- and other-reports, and in two languages. In different samples of altogether more than 1500 adult participants, the CSM was developed and evaluated with respect to internal consistency, homogeneity, test–retest reliability, factorial validity, and construct and criterion validity. Internal consistency was sufficiently high, and the median test-retest reliability over a period of 1 – 2 weeks was 0. 86 (N = 148). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses showed that the eight styles could be distinguished in both English- (N = 303) and German-speaking samples (N = 1018 and 368). Comparing self- and other-reports (N = 210) supported both convergent and discriminant validity. The intercorrelations among the eight scales ranged from close to zero (between humor and sarcasm/cynicism) to large and positive (between sarcasm and cynicism). Consequently, second-order factor analyses revealed either two <b>bipolar</b> <b>factors</b> (based on ipsative data) or three unipolar factors (based on normative data). Study 2 related the CSM to instruments measuring personality (N = 999), intelligence (N = 214), and character strengths (N = 252), showing that (a) wit was the only style correlated with (verbal) intelligence, (b) fun was related to indicators of vitality and extraversion, (c) humor was related to character strengths of the heart, and (d) comic styles related to mock/ridicule (i. e., sarcasm, cynicism, but also irony) correlated negatively with character strengths of the virtues temperance, transcendence, and humanity. By contrast, satire had a moral goodness that was lacking in sarcasm and cynicism. Most importantly, the two studies revealed that humor might be related to a variety of character strengths depending on the comic style utilized, and that more styles may be distinguished than has been done in the past. The CSM is recommended for future explorations and refinements of comic styles...|$|R

However, empirical studies have not consistently supported the benefits of team autonomy.

Further, we view team autonomy as a <b>bipolar</b> <b>factor</b> and argue that both the behavioral and mechanistic effects of team autonomy on operational outcomes are non-linear. Drawing on information processing theory, we propose that the benefits of team autonomy depend on the degree of technological turbulence. A study of 212 new product development projects supports these propositions. Specifically, the relationship between team autonomy and operational outcomes is ∩-shaped in technologically turbulent environments and U-shaped in technologically stable environments. Further, operational outcomes mediate the relationships between team autonomy and product success.

40|$|Objective: The general aim of {{this study}} was to explore the victimization process of the {{so-called}} “pyramid scheme fraud”. Specifically the causal agents of this fraud and the consequent damage were analyzed as well as the victims’ different responses. Method: The sample comprised 14 victims of the fraud (12 direct victims and 2 indirect victims) aged 47 - 87 years old. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in depth, comprising a total of 36 questions. Results: The factors involved in the fraud appear simultaneously, these factors being economic and trust elements. Considering the reactions to this type of scam, the <b>bipolar</b> <b>factor</b> of earning vs. losing money seems to play a basic role in those victims who decide to invest. This way two different behaviors may emerge: on the one hand, the legitimation of this “business” and, on the other hand, the rejection of it. Conclusions: There were no significant differences between the factors that influence people to invest and maintain their investment in the pyramid scheme fraud. However, some differences have been observed with respect to the reactions against the scam. Future studies should be based on bigger samples, which could lead to the acquisition of a personality profile of the victims.

A questionnaire to establish teacher views was designed through research and consultation with other teachers, piloted initially with a preliminary group of ten teachers, then redesigned {{in the light of}} these responses. The questionnaire was designed to obtain information on demographics, theoretical perspectives, educational contexts, working comparisons, and individual preferences related to sociability, perceiving, cognitive processing, decision making, action and organisation, perceptual openness, interpretative preferences and management and discipline preferences. It was named the Teacher Effectiveness Questionnaire (TEQ). A Likert-type 1 - 5 scale was used for rating responses from the TEQ and the resultant data factor analysed resulting in four factors which were given the titles: Responsiveness; Professional Teamwork; Planning and Management; and a <b>bipolar</b> <b>factor</b> of Practical Experience versus Theory (hereinafter termed the Theory Factor).

Risk <b>factors</b> and prevention of suicide in this illness are the focus of considerable current research. Methods: MEDLINE data base was searched for the key words “bipolar disorder ” with “suicide”, "lithium " with "suicide", "anticonvulsants " with "bipolar disorder", and "anticonvulsants " with "bipolar disorder " and with "suicide". No language or time constraints were applied. The lists of references were searched manually to find additional articles. Results: It is estimated that 25 % to 50 % of patients with bipolar disorder will attempt suicide at least once over their lifetime, and that 8 % to 19 % will complete suicide. Mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases are elevated in <b>bipolar</b> disorder. Risk <b>factors</b> for suicide include younger age of onset of the illness, history of past suicidal behavior, family history of suicide acts, comorbid borderline personality disorder and substance use disorders, and hopelessness. The warning signs calling for immediate action include the patients threatening to harm themselves, or looking for ways to kill themselves (seeking access to pills or weapons), or the patient talking or writing about death. Robust evidence supports the effects of lithium treatment in reducing suicidal attempts and completions in bipolar disorder. The evidence for antisuicidal effects of anticonvulsants is weaker. Nevertheless, valproate and other anticonvulsants are frequently prescribed as mood stabilizers.

30|$|The most {{important}} reason for this factor extraction {{may be attributed to}} a Japanese cultural aspect, cautiousness accompanied by a feeling of shame, experienced in not only general but also educational situations. In one of the earliest studies, Benedict (1946) explained Japanese culture in terms of shame (haji in Japanese language). For example, she explained that “[t]hose who do respect themselves (jicho [in Japanese language]) chart their course … between ‘expected man’ and ‘unexpected man,’ and sink their own personal demands in the collective ‘expectation.’ These are the good men who ‘know shame (haji)’ and are endlessly circumspect” (p. 293). Following some native researchers’ criticism or supplemental explanation (e.g., Sakuda, 1967; Uchinuma, 1983), this idea still seems to be {{regarded as one of the}} {{most important}} cultural values ingrained in modern Japanese people, who generally emphasize on becoming harmonized with others and atmosphere at a given situation. 5 Thus, in order to meet the collective expectation, some of them tend to take time before responding. This cultural feature appears to lead people to cautious behavior that can also be frequently seen in current educational settings. For example, Doyon (2000) adopts the following explanation to describe the cause of Japanese learners’ shyness: “[f]or many Japanese people in many situations, there seems to be an intense fear of making mistakes” (p. 14) and points out the influences of the fear in a language class. Furthermore, the description of Saito and Eisenstein Ebsworth (2004) also illustrates the current classroom situation in Japan: “[m]any students do not volunteer unless they are sure that their answers are correct” (p. 112). Some Japanese learners of English might take time to become an “expected” person, who could provide a right answer, assuming that it would be embarrassing to make a mistake in front of others, or who could avoid distracting the class with a wild statement, believing that it would disgust classmates. In this type of value, learners might have taken on a cognitive style represented as “reflective.” For learners to render accuracy and correctness to what they say and do, they tend to “take their time to react” and “think about things before they do or say” (see reflective 1 and 3 in Appendix). Some learners are, of course, naturally impulsive and free from the effects of this type of pressure. However, as the mean score (i.e., M[*]=[*] 5.47) was positioned on the reflective side with statistical significance and a certain effect size (Table 4), the value still seems to have a certain impact favoring the development of the reflective style. Thus, cautious behavior to cope with the cultural aspect represented also in educational settings is probably one of the reasons that the <b>bipolar</b> <b>factor</b> of impulsive – reflective was extracted for Japanese adult EFL learners.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if the type of recommendations made by the school psychologist on the psychological report affected teacher perception of the school psychologist and if the type of recommendations influenced the frequency of utilization of the report. An attempt was made in this study to make the recommendations of the report more useful to special education teachers. Since their training included knowledge of methods and materials to use with children with problems, areas typically covered in the recommendations of a psychological report, these areas were deleted. In this study the recommendations were made which directed the teachers to prewritten goals which could be used in writing a student's individual educational plan (IEP). As a requirement of the Education for Handicapped Children Act, 1975, an IEP with long and short-range goals must be written for each child in special education. An assumption was made that by lessening the teacher's work in writing the IEP, the school psychologist might be perceived as more useful. An end result might be a more positive attitude toward the school psychologist as well as an increased utilization of the report. The pre-written IEP goals used in the study were the 2, 400 "identifying behaviors" of the Behavioral Characteristics Progression published by the Vort Corporation. These field-tested behaviors were developmentally sequenced into 59 goal areas. The subjects included all of the Coweta county (Georgia) special education teachers (N = 32) whose students were required to have a psychoeducational evaluation before entrance into those teachers' respective programs. All the teachers were licensed by the state of Georgia as certified or provisionally certified special education teachers. The posttest only control group design was used. The subjects were randomly assigned to groups Table of Random Numbers. Each group, control and experimental, had an N of 16. A six-month duration was set. Both groups received the exact treatment exception of the independent variable, the type of recommendations made in the written psychological report. All the subjects in both groups were asked to mark a tracking sheet which had been attached to each psychological report. The tracking sheet listed eight instances for which a psychological report could be used. The subjects were to mark the appropriate instance each time the report was used. The tracking sheet was developed by the researcher for this study. At the end of six' months the tracking sheets were collected and a semantic differential using 15 pairs of <b>bipolar</b> <b>factor</b> analyzed evaluation-loaded adjectives derived from C. E. Osgood's work was administered to all subjects. The semantic differential was used to measure attitude toward the school psychologist. The tracking sheets were used to determine frequency of utilization of the psychological reports. A t-test for independent samples was performed using the mean scores from the semantic differentials and yielded an insignificant difference (at the. 05 level of confidence) in attitude toward the school psychologist as a result of the treatment of recommendations. One dimensional chi square statistical procedures were applied to determine if the frequency of utilization of the reports was significant between the two groups. The frequency of utilization was significantly greater (at the. 05 level of confidence) as a result the treatment of the recommendations. Based upon analysis of the data the following conclusions were made: 1. No significant difference in attitude toward the school psychologist existed between two groups of special education teachers as a result of the treatment of recommendations in the psychological report. 2. As a result of the treatment of the recommendations in the psychological report, the frequency of utilization of the report significantly increased. Thesis (Ed. S. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} how the sleep disruptions and irregular {{physical activity levels}} that are prominent features of bipolar disorder (BD) relate to white matter microstructure in patients and controls. Diffusion tension imaging (DTI) and 14 -day actigraphy recordings were obtained in 51 BD I patients and 55 age-and-gender-matched healthy controls. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was used for voxelwise analysis of the association between fractional anisotropy (FA) and sleep and activity characteristics in the overall sample. Next, we investigated whether the relation between sleep and activity and DTI measures differed for patients and controls. Physical activity was related to increased integrity of white matter microstructure regardless of bipolar diagnosis. The relationship between sleep and white matter microstructure was more equivocal; we found an expected association between higher FA and effective sleep in controls but opposite patterns in <b>bipolar</b> patients. Confounding <b>factors</b> such as antipsychotic medication use are a likely explanation for these contrasting findings and highlight {{the need for further}} study of medication-related effects on white matter integrity...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{literature}} {{based on}} peripheral immunity findings speculated that neuroinflammation, with its connection to microglial activation, {{is linked to}} bipolar disorder. The endorsement of the neuroinflammatory hypotheses of bipolar disorder requires the demonstration of causality, which requires longitudinal studies. We aimed to review the evidence for neuroinflammation as a pathogenic mechanism of the bipolar disorder. We carried out a hyper inclusive PubMed search using all appropriate neuroinflammation-related terms and crossed them with bipolar disorder-related terms. The search produced 310 articles and the number rose to 350 after adding articles from other search engines and reference lists. Twenty papers were included that appropriately tackled {{the issue of the}} presence (but not of its pathophysiological role) of neuroinflammation in bipolar disorder. Of these, 15 were postmortem and 5 were carried out in living humans. Most articles were consistent with the presence of neuroinflammation in <b>bipolar</b> disorder, but <b>factors</b> such as treatment may mask it. All studies were cross-sectional, preventing causality to be inferred. Thus, no inference can be currently made about the role of neuroinflammation in bipolar disorder, but a link is likely. The issue remains little investigated, despite an excess of reviews on this topic...|$|R
40|$|WISC-R Verbal and Performance {{factorial}} IQs {{have been}} developed that can pro-vide a formal statistical metric for {{the description of the}} patterns of cognitive ability exhibited by children with learning disability. The present study of 813 children includes test-retest data from 224 boys and girls. The results in large part confirm previous findings. These children suffer a progressive deterioration in verbal ability, whereas their nonverbal ability shows an increase in the earlier years, leveling off thereafter. These results can be used to evaluate the alternative hypothesis of developmental lag as opposed to deficit as a cause of learning disability. Lawson and Inglis (1985) have argued that the pattern of intelligence test results shown by children with learning disability (LD) on the Wechsler (1949, 1974) tests may be most economically described in terms of the second <b>bipolar,</b> verbal-nonverbal <b>factor</b> derived from an unrotated principal components analysis of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) (Wechsler, 1974) normative data (Lawson & Inglis, 1984). This characteristic pattern can be summarized in terms of a Learning Dis-ability Index (LDI). In order to calculate the LDI, the Factor 2 score coefficients are used in combination with the indi-vidual's subtest scaled scores; the method for its computation and its psy-chometric properties have been de-scribed in detail by Lawson and Inglis (1984). The LDI has a normal distri-bution with a mean of zero and standard deviation of 301 in the WISC-R stan-dardization population, when 11 of the subtests (i. e., excluding Mazes) are con-sidered. Lawson and Inglis (1985) have reviewed WISC (Wechsler, 1949), and WISC-R (Wechsler, 1974) data from a number of studies of children with LD and have demonstrated that the amount of deficit that these children show on any particular subtest is proportional to its verbal content thus defined. Children with LD therefore tend to return abnor-mally high positive LDIs {{as a result of the}} pattern of their WISC-R subtest scores. Evidence for the validity of the LDI is now available from a number of sources. Tittemore, Lawson, and Ingli...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Comprehensively review studies {{evaluating}} {{factors associated}} with adherence to treatment in bipolar disorder (BD), {{as well as the}} results of interventions developed to enhance adherence in this population. Methods: the following search engines were consulted: PubMed, Scielo, LILACS and PsycINFO. the keywords used were <b>Bipolar</b> Disorder, <b>Factor,</b> Adherence, Nonadherence, Compliance and Intervention. in addition, references list of selected studies were consulted searching for relevant articles. Results: Adherence has been defined in various ways, with some considering adherence vs. nonadherence, and other including a partial adherence measure. in addition, methods to assess adherence differ for each study. Several factors were related to poor adherence, including patient-related factors (e. g. younger age, male gender, low level of education, alcohol and drugs comorbidity), disorder-related factors (e. g. younger age of onset, severity of BD, insight and lack of awareness of illness) and treatment-related factors (e. g. side effects of medications, effectiveness). To improve adherence, the main recommendations are to provide customized interventions focusing on the underlying causes of nonadherence, strong therapeutic alliance and different modalities based on psychoeducation. Conclusion: Our results indicate that nonadherence is a multicausal phenomenon and strategies to prevent and approaches them must include enhanced therapeutic alliance, flexible topics, early intervention, group setting, and psychoeducation. Limitations: Different definitions and measures of adherence in the literature currently moderate the generalization of the findings in this review. Further studies are necessary regarding factors of adherence in BD and interventions to improve it, especially on social factors like stigma and family. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Berit Kerner Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA Abstract: Bipolar {{disorder}} is a common, complex genetic disorder, but {{the mode of}} transmission remains to be discovered. Many researchers assume that common genomic variants carry some risk for manifesting the disease. The research community has celebrated the first genome-wide significant associations between common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and bipolar disorder. Currently, attempts {{are under way to}} translate these findings into clinical practice, genetic counseling, and predictive testing. However, some experts remain cautious. After all, common variants explain only {{a very small percentage of}} the genetic risk, and functional consequences of the discovered SNPs are inconclusive. Furthermore, the associated SNPs are not disease specific, and the majority of individuals with a “risk” allele are healthy. On the other hand, population-based genome-wide studies in psychiatric disorders have rediscovered rare structural variants and mutations in genes, which were previously known to cause genetic syndromes and monogenic Mendelian disorders. In many Mendelian syndromes, psychiatric symptoms are prevalent. Although these conditions do not fit the classic description of any specific psychiatric disorder, they often show nonspecific psychiatric symptoms that cross diagnostic boundaries, including intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, attention deficit, impulse control deficit, and psychosis. Although testing for chromosomal disorders and monogenic Mendelian disorders is well established, testing for common variants is still controversial. The standard concept of genetic testing includes at least three broad criteria that need to be fulfilled before new genetic tests should be introduced: analytical validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility. These criteria are currently not fulfilled for common genomic variants in psychiatric disorders. Further work is clearly needed before genetic testing for common variants in psychiatric disorders should be established.

40|$|One {{important}} area of positive psychology exam-ines happiness and subjective well-being (SWB; Diener, 2000). Diener (1984) noted that SWB has an affective and a cognitive component. The cognitive component of SWB is assessed with life satisfaction judgments (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, &Griffin, 1985). The affective component assesses {{the amount of}} pleasant and unpleasant experiences in people’s lives (e. g., Schimmack, Diener, & Oishi, 2002). Early on, SWB researchers noted the limita-tions of research programs that focused exclu-sively on negative states such as depression and anxiety. In an influential article, Diener (1984) proposed that SWB {{is more than the}} absence of negative affect (NA). Although low levels of NA are important for SWB, high levels of positive affect (PA) are also important. Diener’s (1984) conception of SWB in terms of high PA and low NA implies that PA and NA are separable components of SWB. In other words, measures of PA show discriminant validity from mea-sures of NA. If PA and NA were bipolar oppo-sites, then minimization of NA would also maximize PA. In contrast, the distinction of PA and NA as separate components of SWB implies that PA and NA have different causes and con-sequences. The conceptualization of PA and NA as separate dimensions of SWB created a heated debate in the affect literature (Diener, 1999). This chapter gives a brief overview of the debate with a focus on the methodological issues that have fuelled the debate. Positive Affect and Negative Affect In the early 1980 s, several independent lines of research converged on the view that PA and NA are separable (i. e., not <b>bipolar</b> opposite) dimen-sions. <b>Factor</b> analyses of self-reported affects often resulted in two factors, with pleasant items loading on one factor and unpleasant items loading on the other factor. Personality research-ers noted that PA and NA are related to different personality traits. Whereas extraversion is a stronger predictor of PA than NA, neuroticism is a stronger predictor of PA than NA (Costa &...|$|R
40|$|Although it {{is still}} {{possible}} to encounter the view that medication is the only method of treatment for bipolar disorder, research shows that there is a significant need for a comprehensive and integrative approach to this complex disorder. The current thesis firstly describes the rationale and development of a new, psychological intervention specifically directed at bipolar disorder, and secondly reports on an evaluation of this approach to treatment. Using a longitudinal design with replication across 13 participants, combined with the use of multiple case study methodology and qualitative data collection strategies, which allowed for triangulation between multiple data sources, it is concluded that the newly developed Therapeutic Instability Model approach to treatment had a significant and positive impact on factors of importance when treating <b>bipolar</b> disorder. These <b>factors</b> included hopelessness, known to be predictive of suicidal behaviour, and perceived control over internal states, a central aspect of bipolar disorder. As part of the evaluation, insights into which factors are important for client satisfaction and perceived usefulness of a treatment were also gained and it is argued that these should be borne in mind when attempting to develop interventions with high effectiveness and low dropout from treatment. The study further-more found positive changes occurring {{as a result of the}} intervention in thoughts, feelings, behaviours and illness related knowledge, and began a mapping of the participants' understanding or subjective models of their disorder's aetiology and maintenance. Further, two distinct patterns of change in important variables were observed during treatment and appear to be related to the participants' general attitude to having future episodes of mania. In relation to this, it was noted that specific interventions, such as behavioural experiments, may be more important for outcomes of treatment for individuals with a positive/ambivalent attitude to mania compared with individuals who do not share this attitude to manic experiences. It was argued that these findings could have potentially important clinical implications and a number of suggestions with regards to further research in this, and other, areas relating to the study were finally made...|$|R

A polymorphic variant of the BDNF (Val 66 Met) confers some differences in the clinical presentation of affective disorders. In this study, we evaluated a sample population from Mexico City {{to determine whether the}} BDNF (rs 6265) Val 66 Met polymorphism is associated with the body mass index (BMI) of patients with BD. Methods: This association study included a sample population of 357 individuals recruited in Mexico City. A total of 139 participants were diagnosed with BD and 137 were classified as psychiatrically healthy controls (all individuals were interviewed and evaluated by the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay was performed in 96 -well plates using the TaqMan Universal Thermal Cycling Protocol. After the PCR end point was reached, fluorescence intensity was measured in a 7, 500 real-time PCR system and evaluated using the SDS v 2. 1 software, results were analyzed with Finetti and SPSS software. Concerning BMI stratification, random groups were defined as follows: normal 30 kg/m 2. Results: In the present work, we report the association of a particular BMI phenotype with the presence of the Val 66 Met allele in patients with BD (P= 0. 0033 and odds ratio [95 % confidence interval] = 0. 332 [157 – 0. 703]), and correlated the risk for valine allele carriers with Ow and Ob in patients with BD. Conclusion: We found that the methionine allele confers a lower risk of developing Ow and Ob in patients with BD. We also confirmed that the G polymorphism represents a risk of developing Ow and Ob in patients with BD. In future studies, the haplotype analysis should provide additional evidence that BDNF may be associated with BD and BMI within the Mexican population.

40|$|Objectives. Poor {{adherence}} to medication treatment can have devastating consequences {{for patients with}} mental illness. The goal of this project was to develop recommendations for addressing adherence problems to improve patient outcomes. Methods. The editors identified important topics and questions concerning medication adherence problems in serious mental illness that are not fully addressed in the literature. A survey was developed containing 39 questions (521 options) asking about defining nonadherence, extent of adherence problems in schizophrenia and <b>bipolar</b> disorder, risk <b>factors</b> for nonadherence, assessment methods, and interventions for specific types of adherence problems. The survey was completed by 41 (85 %) of the 48 experts to whom it was sent. Results of the literature review and survey were used to develop recommendations for assessing and improving adherence in patients with serious mental illness. Results. ASSESSING ADHERENCE: The experts endorsed percentage of medication not taken as the preferred method of defining adherence, with 80 % or more of medication taken endorsed as an appropriate cut-off for adherence in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Although self- and physician report {{are the most common}} methods used to assess adherence in clinical settings, they are often inaccurate and may underestimate nonadherence. The experts recommend that, if possible, clinicians also use more objective measures (e. g., pill counts, pharmacy records, and, when appropriate, serum levels such as are used for lithium). Use of a validated self-report scale may help improve accuracy. SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM: The majority of the experts believed the average patient with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in their practices takes only 51 %- 70 % of prescribed medication. FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH NONADHERENCE: The experts endorsed poor insight and lack of illness awareness, distress associated with specific side effects or a general fear of side effects, inadequate efficacy with persistent symptoms, and believing medications are no longer needed as the most important factors leading to adherence problems in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The experts considered weight gain a side effect that is very likely to lead to adherence problems in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; sedation was considered a more important contributor to adherence problems in bipolar disorder than schizophrenia. The experts rated persistent positive or negative symptoms in schizophrenia and persistent grandiosity and manic symptoms in bipolar disorder as the most important symptomatic contributors to adherence problems in these illnesses. INTERVENTIONS: It is important to identify the specific factors that may be contributing to a patient's adherence problems in order to customize interventions to target those problems. Multiple problems may be involved, requiring a combination of interventions. Conclusions. Adherence problems are complex and multi-determined. The experts recommended customized interventions focused on the underlying causes. Copyright © of content 2009 owned by Comprehensive Neuroscience, Inc...|$|R
