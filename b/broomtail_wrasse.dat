40|$|The Cheilinus lunulatus (<b>broomtail</b> <b>wrasse)</b> is {{a species}} of wrasse native to the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. It is {{another one of the}} big wrasses which has a very low {{abundance}} on the local scale and in this case a limited geographical distribution. <b>Broomtail</b> <b>wrasse</b> lives in shallow waters, but also at 2 to 30 m of depth on the outer side of the reefs. It is often going around on the sandy bottoms, at the limit of the madreporic formations, in the prairies of submerged grasslands looking for shells it crushes easily, like a nutcracker. C. lunulatus can reach an average length of about 40 cm in female, with a maximum of 60 cm in males (Iran, Persian Gulf, Kish Island). In adults, the head is large and bright green, with small spots. The lips are large and blue. Females and juveniles show large, dark stripes on their flanks. It is oviparous. It nourishes of benthic animals, mainly molluscs, but also of crustaceans. It lives alone or in small groups of 4 - 8 individuals headed by a big male. As often is the case {{in the world of the}} labrids, it is a protogynous, hermaphrodite species, with females that, while growing, can transform into males. The fecundated eggs are entrusted to the currents and the young have a life expectancy of almost 20 years. Juveniles are found in shallower water. Adult depth distribution ranges from 5 - 45 m...|$|E
40|$|Gram-positive chain-forming {{bacteria}} {{were isolated}} from the spleen, kidney, and blood of dead wild Red Sea fish (<b>broomtail</b> <b>wrasse</b> Cheilinus lunulatus, grouper Epinephelus fasciatus, goatfish Parupeneus sp.) that washed ashore on the Eilat Nature Reserve beach (Israel, Red Sea). Gram-positive bacteria were similarly isolated from rabbitfish Siganus rivulatus, white grouper Epinephelus aeneus, and grey mullet Mugil cephalus cultured in the Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research, National Center for Mariculture, Eilat. On {{the basis of their}} phenotypical characteristics and 16 S rRNA gene partial sequence analyses, the bacteria were identified as Streptococcus parauberis (from C. lunulatus), Lactococcus lactis (from E. aeneus and M. cephalus), Streptococcus iniae (from E. fasciatus, Parupeneus sp. and S. rivulatus), Streptococcus agalactiae (from M. cephalus), and Carnobacterium sp. (from E. aeneus). These lactic acid bacteria, isolated between 2009 and 2011, are added to the growing list of bacterial pathogens detected in wild or farmed marine fish in the Gulf of Eilat in recent years, suggesting a rising trend in areas subjected to intense anthropogenic impact (including aquaculture), where newly emerging pathogens and previously unexposed host populations are brought together...|$|E
