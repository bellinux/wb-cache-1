40|$|The Supreme Court of the United States in {{deciding}} Federal Trade Commission v. The Cement Institute, et al. {{found that the}} pricing system utilized in the cement industry was unlawful. Under this system, called a <b>basing-point</b> <b>system,</b> the delivered price of a product at any destination is so calculated as to be identical no matter where the product is produced or from what point it is shipped. The calculations are simple. Published and readily available transportation charges are added to published posted prices for selected base points (usually but not necessarily major producing centers); the lowest {{combination of the two}} factors-base price and transportation price from a base-is then the delivered price, quoted by all the participants in a <b>basing-point</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

40|$|Basing-point pricing {{is known}} to have been abused by {{geographically}} dispersed firms in order to eliminate competition on transportation costs. This paper develops a topographic test for collusive basing-point pricing. The method uses transaction data (prices, quantities) and customer project site locations to recover the basing-point(s) from which delivered prices were calculated. These bases are compared to the locations of the production mills in a test that discriminates between competitive and collusive basing-point pricing. We define a measure for the likelihood of collusion {{that can be used to}} screen industries that traditionally apply delivered pricing for the presence of cartels. We operationalize this screen with a software. The test is hard to beat for cartels using this otherwise elusive form of price-fixing. When a cartel was found to have abused the <b>basing-point</b> <b>system,</b> our method can be used to estimate antitrust damages. basing-point pricing, cartels, detection, antitrust, damages...|$|E
40|$|In a study {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} effect of basing-point pricing on the economic growth of the South, Professor Stocking has limited himself to a single industry–steel–in which basing-point pricing practice is analyzed {{as a part of}} the structure and ownership pattern in that industry. Professor Stocking concludes that both the ownership pattern and the <b>basing-point</b> pricing <b>system</b> have retarded the expansion of steel production in the South...|$|R
