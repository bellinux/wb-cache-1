500|$|When {{asked if}} {{religion}} {{plays a part}} in her life in 2009, Streep replied: [...] "I follow no doctrine. I don't belong to a church or a temple or a synagogue or an ashram." [...] In an interview in December 2008, she also alluded to her lack of religious belief when she said: [...] "So I've always been really, deeply interested, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can understand the solace that's available in the whole construct of religion. But I really don't believe {{in the power of}} prayer, or things would have been avoided that have happened, that are awful. So it's a horrible position as an intelligent, emotional, yearning human being to sit outside of the available comfort there. But I just can't go there." ...|$|E
2500|$|I'm {{proud of}} it. It was difficult; {{it was hard}} work. I'm proud of the work <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> made some little {{difference}} in women in science. I grew to really love Star Trek: Voyager, {{and out of a}} cast of nine, I've made three great friends, I managed to raise two children. I think, [...] "It's good. I used myself well." ...|$|E
6000|$|Congdon looked thoughtful. [...] "She may be right, but I don't think so. The girl {{interests}} me, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> see in {{her great}} possibilities." ...|$|E
5000|$|Той щял да ме набие. (Bulgarian, {{doubtful}} future: He {{is going}} to beat me up, but <b>I</b> do not <b>think</b> that would be possible <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> am stronger than him) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes--better," [...] she {{answered}} immediately. [...] "No, not better, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could love you better than Tom; but I {{should be so}} sorry--so sorry for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, better," [...] she {{answered}} immediately. [...] "No, not better; <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could love you better than Tom. But I {{should be so}} sorry,--so sorry for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The reason I ask is <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{may be able}} to {{help you}} to obtain employment. I won't offer you money as a reward--I don't believe in such things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How much do {{you think}} we ought to pay?" [...] asked Dick. [...] "Name a {{reasonable}} price and I may settle, just to avoid trouble, and not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> ought to pay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I wish {{to begin}} now, if I can, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{ought to make}} some money to buy things for the family. I am ten, and other boys no bigger than I earn pennies sometimes." ...|$|E
5000|$|I feel honoured, I feel proud. I'm {{a little}} embarrassed <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> deserve all those {{wonderful}} compliments, so I just don't quite know how to behave. But it's a really wonderful day for me and I will remember it {{for a very long}} time.|$|R
6000|$|Paula nodded, {{then quickly}} added, [...] "No, not quite that. <b>Because</b> you know <b>I</b> don't {{want to keep}} you away ... too far. <b>I</b> say it <b>because</b> Dick is so much in my mind. For twelve years, you realize, he filled my mind. <b>I</b> say it <b>because</b> ... <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it, <b>I</b> suppose. <b>Think!</b> The situation! You are {{trespassing}} on a perfect marriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I did {{not speak}} very loud, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could do so {{and at the same}} time keep my mind at work and {{thoughts}} collected. Anything which is so unnatural and unusual as to make me conscious of myself in a peculiar manner would prevent, I fear, my getting on with my oration at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{nothing that}} I don't like?--please say that; <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> dislike what I don't like more than I like what I like," [...] said Gwendolen, finding {{herself in the}} woman's paradise, where all her {{nonsense}} is adorable.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has been}} {{attempting}} rather {{too much of}} late," [...] was the answer, [...] "and has knocked himself up. I came to tell you, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> had better stay with him, and perhaps you might miss me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you {{are losing}} a chance you'll never get {{again in a}} lifetime," [...] and Allonby made a little gesture of resignation. [...] "I would have liked you to have taken it, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could make you believe in me. That is why I showed you the medals." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{must say}} this, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{ought to have}} asked you to go away, and I want {{you to believe that}} I will keep my promise, or I should feel that you and {{everybody}} else had a right to condemn me. I was awake all last night, and have a bad headache this morning. I can't write any more. ANTONIA.|$|R
6000|$|... "Caramba, my friend," [...] he said, {{addressing}} Dirk, whose {{back was}} turned towards the figure, [...] "have you any ghosts in this gloomy old room of yours? <b>Because,</b> if so, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{have just seen}} one." ...|$|R
6000|$|I am {{very glad}} {{of what you}} tell me about the certain [...] gentleman, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could have been happy [...] at Stalham if he had been there. It {{surprised}} me so much [...] that <b>I</b> could not <b>think</b> that he meant it in earnest. We [...] never hardly spoke to each other {{when we were in the}} house [...] together.|$|R
6000|$|When {{they reached}} the finca and Wyndham and Marston were alone {{for a few minutes}} the former said, [...] "Perhaps it's lucky we came here, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have found a clew. I expect you noted they tried to keep the {{drilling}} and equipping of the President's battalion a secret." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be angry, Hans," [...] {{continued}} Fred; [...] "I ask {{the question}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can help you in the matter if you will allow me. I do not ask it out of idle curiosity. Come, tell me your troubles like a good fellow, and I'll {{put you in the}} way of getting out of them." ...|$|E
60|$|Let us abolish policemen {{who carry}} clubs and revolvers, {{and put in}} a squad of poets armed to the teeth with poems on Spring and Love. I would be very glad to serve as commissioner, not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am {{especially}} qualified, but because I am too tired to work and would like to take a rest.|$|E
3000|$|Yeah, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it’s {{much more}} the mathematician, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> if <b>I</b> was {{concerned}} about the students you’d just do it like I’ve done it in the notes. You’d sweep it under the carpet and it would all proceed right. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it’s precisely being a mathematician and going mm… I want to make sure this is right, and so you make a big fuss out of something which is kind of… [...]...|$|R
2500|$|Despite his {{classical}} crossover success, Garðar has said, [...] "I don't {{want to go}} too {{far down}} the pop side <b>because</b> then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> would lose credibility in the classical world. If the album [...] does well, hopefully I could use that to my advantage, but I'm a classical opera singer – that's what I do, that's what I am." [...] His ambition is to sing Otello at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London.|$|R
5000|$|Madsen later {{attended}} the Ted Liss Acting Studio in Chicago, and Harand Camp Adult Theater Seminar in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin. Of her experience with Liss, she said: [...] "I {{had wanted to}} join his class since I was 12. It was well worth the wait <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could have got that sort of training anywhere else especially in the United States... I always {{wanted to make a}} real career out of acting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am beautiful," [...] said Gertrude, looking all round. [...] "I don't think I am beautiful, at all." [...] She {{spoke with}} a sort of {{conscious}} deliberateness; and it seemed very strange to Charlotte to hear her discussing this question so publicly. [...] "It is because I think it would be amusing to sit and be painted. I have always thought that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whereas I hold," [...] {{shouted the}} other, [...] "with my revered preceptor, doctor, praeclarus et excellentissimus, that {{all things are}} but thought; for when thought is gone I prythee where are the things then? Here are trees about us, and I see them <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> see them, but if I have swooned, or sleep, or am in wine, then, my thought having gone forth from me, lo the trees go forth also. How now, coz, have I touched thee on the raw?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Marshall, I {{want to ask}} you a question. Perhaps {{you will}} think it isn't any of my business. But it isn't because I want to meddle. No, no. It is only <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> ought to speak. I have thought it over for a long time, and it seems to me that I ought to speak. I hope you won't be angry, but even if you are I must say what I have to say. Are you going back to the old Connors orchard to meet Kilmeny Gordon?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... brokenangel:"Everything {{just started}} to get better ... I could deal with {{everything}} better. I haven't self harmed since December 6th 2005. I haven't felt unworthy or disgusting {{or anything like that}} for about a year and I'm showing no signs of going back. I'm getting stronger everyday. The reason for me saying all of this is <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> would've been able to do it without the support I got from everybody here." ...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{not until}} Welch began writing and {{recording}} with childhood friend Isabella Summers at her small independent workplace, Antenna Studios, in London that Welch crafted a sound she wanted to develop further. Distraught but also inspired from a recently failed relationship, Welch recorded with [...] "enthusiasm over skills", stating [...] "Im quite glad I never learned to play the guitar, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Id</b> write songs that were more classically structured. As it is, Ive had to create my own way of writing, which isnt typical. Everythings a big crescendo". For a brief while, Welch and Summers performed as a duo called Florence Robot/Isa Machine in small London venues. Over the coming months, Robert Ackroyd (guitar, backing vocals), Chris Hayden (drums, percussion, backing vocals), Mark Saunders (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Tom Monger (harp) were recruited to form a band, renamed Florence and the Machine. Additionally, prior to being signed by Island Records in November 2008, Welch recalled conversing with several session guitarists and drummers to help arrange her preferred style, which she explained was [...] "a wave of sound that would envelope, something that was soaring, slightly church-like and then-doomlike".|$|R
50|$|I call Henry Miller the {{greatest}} living author <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he is. <b>I</b> {{do not call}} him a poet because he has never written a poem; he even dislikes poetry, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> But everything he has written is a poem in the best {{as well as in}} the broadest sense of the word.|$|R
6000|$|And {{yet when}} the good General died (calm, {{and full of}} years, and glad to depart), I think it was my wife who shed the most tears. [...] "I weep <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> did not love him enough," [...] said the tender creature: whereas Hetty scarce {{departed}} from her calm, at least outwardly and before any of us; talks of him constantly still, {{as though he were}} alive; recalls his merry sayings, his gentle, kind ways with his children (when she brightens up and looks herself quite a girl again), and sits cheerfully looking up to the slab in church which records his name and some of his virtues, and for once tells no lies.|$|E
6000|$|I {{hope you}} will come to-night. There is {{something}} I cannot tell you [...] then, but {{you ought to know}} it. When we were in France papa thought [...] it wise to settle {{a lot of money on}} me. I don't know how much, but [...] I suppose it was enough to live on if other things went wrong. He [...] never talked to me about it, but I know it was done. And it hasn't [...] been undone, and can't be without my leave. He is very angry about [...] you this morning, for I told him I would never give you up. He says [...] he won't give me anything if I marry without his leave. But I am [...] sure he cannot take it away. I tell you, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> ought to [...] tell you everything.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There was {{a mixture}} of displeasure and grave affection {{in the manner in which}} my father took my hand, that was a severe reproof to me for trifling with his feelings. [...] "Julia," [...] he said, [...] "I bear with much of your petulance <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have in some degree {{deserved}} it, by neglecting to superintend your education sufficiently closely. Yet I would not have you give it the rein upon a subject so delicate. If you do not respect the feelings of your surviving parent towards the memory of her whom you have lost, attend at least to the sacred claims of misfortune; and observe, that the slightest hint of such a jest reaching Miss Bertram's ears would at once induce her to renounce her present asylum, and go forth, without a protector, into a world she has already felt so unfriendly." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} {{a few years}} prior to her death, Payne said, “I stick to my firm, unshakeable belief that the black press is an advocacy press, and that I, {{as a part of}} that press, can’t afford the luxury of being unbiased [...] . . when it come to issues that really affect my people, and <b>I</b> plead guilty, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> am an instrument of change.” On May 28, 1991, at the age 79, Payne {{died of a heart attack}} at her home in Washington, D.C.|$|R
5000|$|... "At {{its core}} it's my {{adaptation}} of DH Lawrence's poem Piano," [...] Mulvey added. [...] "The poem depicts a child under the piano, smiling as its mother sings, so I {{thought it would}} be lovely to have a song within the song. So I'm singing in her voice, really, and then I got the chorus about 'yearning to belong', so it's not just putting his words to my music. At first I was bothered by that, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> should've changed it, but I've got used to it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{before the}} release of their second album James Gang Rides Again, the James Gang opened a show for the legendary rock band the Who in Pittsburgh. Their guitarist Pete Townshend met with the James Gang before they left and was {{impressed}} enough to invite them on the Who's subsequent European tour. When Walsh was asked about this he said that, [...] "Pete's a very melodic player and so am I. He {{told me that he}} appreciated my playing. I was flattered beyond belief <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was that good." ...|$|R
