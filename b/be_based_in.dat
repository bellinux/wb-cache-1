5|$|By early 1988 both No.3 and No.77 Squadrons had {{successfully}} converted to the F/A-18, and No. 79 Squadron {{was no longer}} required. Preparations to return the unit's Mirages to Australia {{took place during the}} first months of 1988, and on 3May they departed Butterworth. As the RAAF's F/A-18 Hornet squadrons were to <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>in</b> Australia, this marked the end of the permanent deployment of RAAF fighters to Butterworth that had begun in mid-1958. No.79 Squadron's aircraft commemorated the occasion by conducting a spectacular low-altitude flypast of the base, the first leg of which commenced at transonic speed. The aircraft were flown to Woomera in central Australia to be placed in storage via Paya Lebar, Bali, Darwin and RAAF Base Tindal. Most of No.79 Squadron's ground crew returned to Australia in late May, and the squadron was formally disbanded at Butterworth on 30June 1988.|$|E
5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right from wrong. Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (principles and rules). In psychological terms conscience {{is often described}} as leading to feelings of remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her moral values and to feelings of rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>in</b> reason has occasioned debate through much of the history of Western philosophy.|$|E

5|$|In November 1991, the Ministry of the Interior {{redefined the}} {{organisation}} {{of the special}} police force, retaining a few units under direct control of the ministry and assigning others to county police administrations. The move was devised {{in response to the}} advance of the JNA. The scheme included the establishment of an SPU in each of the 20 county police administrations. At the time, there were up to 19 such SPUs. Under the scheme, the Karlovac, Gospić, Osijek, Slavonski Brod and Zagreb SPUs were planned to have 180 troops each. The Rijeka, Sisak, Bjelovar and Šibenik SPUs were scheduled to comprise 150 troops each, while the Split, Zadar, Kutina, Vinkovci, Županja and Vukovar SPUs were planned as 120-strong units. The smallest, 100-strong units were to <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>in</b> Pula, Varaždin, Zabok and Dubrovnik. Overall, the scheme called for 2,620 active special police troops in the regionally organised units alone, and defined that each of the units should have a matching number of reserve troops.|$|E

After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant because she felt that she would be thrust into the spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always felt that she was a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Commission {{reported}} in August 1913.

Five of these would <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>in</b> the colony, while the other four would operate out of the Netherlands. Seven foreign companies submitted designs for the contract; naval historians believe that a 26,850-long-ton (27,280tonnes) ship, whose design was submitted by the German firm Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft, would have been eventually selected.|$|E

STScI was established in 1981 after something of a power struggle between NASA and the scientific community at large. NASA had wanted to keep this function in-house, but scientists wanted it to <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>in</b> an academic establishment.

5|$|The {{institutions}} are not concentrated {{in a single}} capital city: instead, their headquarters are spread across four cities, Brussels, Luxembourg, Strasbourg and Frankfurt.

5|$|The {{units of}} the field armies, {{including}} palatini, comitatenses, and sometimes pseudocomitatenses, were based in cities when not on campaign, and could <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>in</b> temporary camps when on campaign. But it seems that did not usually occupy purpose-built accommodation like the city-based limitanei. From the legal evidence, it seems they were normally compulsorily billeted in private houses (hospitalitas). This is because they often wintered in different provinces. The comitatus praesentales accompanied their respective emperors on campaign, while even the regional comitatus would change their winter quarters according to operational requirements. However, in the 5th century, emperors rarely campaigned in person, so the praesentales became more static in their winter bases. The Western comitatus praesentalis normally was based in and around Mediolanum (Milan) and the two Eastern comitatus {{in the vicinity of}} Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Under the new system, it was envisaged {{that one}} regular {{battalion}} would <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom and one overseas. The 1st Battalion {{had been in}} North West England since the late 1870s and had been bombed while based at Salford Barracks in 1881. The attack {{had been the first}} in a dynamite campaign instigated by the Irish Republican Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa. The barracks sustained only minor structural damage from the explosion, which killed a child and badly wounded its mother. Soon afterwards, rioting during mineworkers' strikes in Chowbent, Wigan, and Warrington required the battalion's intervention to prevent further disorder. In 1882, the battalion moved to Ireland, based in the Curragh. During the otherwise uneventful posting, the 1st responded to riots in Belfast. The sectarian disorder coincided with the introduction of the 1886 Home Rule Bill in the British Parliament. The battalion returned to England three years later.|$|E
