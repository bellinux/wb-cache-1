5|$|The Atlanta Constitution {{voted the}} 1911 team's backfield {{the best in}} the South. It {{consisted}} of: Lew Hardage, Wilson Collins, Ammie Sikes, and Ray Morrison. The team's only <b>blemish</b> was a one-point loss to Michigan. The 1912 team led the nation in scoring by margin of victory and lost only to national champion Harvard, though it did suffer a tie with Auburn, the next season's Southern champion.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} piracy cropped up when a news article {{published}} in The Indian Express exposed {{the dark side of}} the film market. Hardly into weeks of the film's release, CDs were being sold at as low as Rs. 40. Another <b>blemish</b> was that Soumitra Dasgupta, a writer and close associate of Sarkar alleged that the film's story had a striking resemblance to his parallel work on the novella.|$|E
5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious <b>blemish</b> on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E

5|$|United {{opened the}} MLS regular season on 19 March 2011. Their {{campaign}} opened in strong fashion, amassing a 3–1 victory over Eastern Conference foes, Columbus Crew. In the match, two of United's recent acquisitions tallied the three goals on the scoresheet; two for Charlie Davies, who came on as a 55th-minute substitute, {{and one for}} Josh Wolff. The goals for Davies were his first since 12 August 2009; when he scored for the U.S. national team in their 1–2 loss against Mexico in Estadio Azteca. The lone <b>blemish</b> for the Black-and-Red that evening was a converted penalty kick by long-time Crew midfielder Robbie Rogers in the 83rd minute.|$|E
5|$|On Christmas Eve, Edgeworth {{is arrested}} {{for the murder}} of {{attorney}} Robert Hammond. He initially refuses Phoenix's help, but ultimately relents. Manfred Von Karma, Edgeworth's mentor, has himself appointed as a special prosecutor. After Phoenix learns that another man, Yanni Yogi, shot Hammond, he discovers that Von Karma provided him with the gun. Years earlier, Edgeworth's father, Gregory, convinced a judge to penalize Von Karma for misconduct, ruining his spotless record. Unable to deal with such a <b>blemish</b> on his legacy, Von Karma murdered Gregory in cold blood, leaving Edgeworth to believe himself responsible. Phoenix explains that Edgeworth motivated him to become an attorney: When a young Phoenix was accused of stealing money (a crime for which Larry was the true culprit), Edgeworth persuaded his teacher not to punish him. Following his father's murder, however, Edgeworth, motivated by a hatred of criminals, decided to become Von Karma's pupil instead. After Von Karma suffers a breakdown in court and confesses to the cover-up, Edgeworth is set free. Nevertheless, he decides to rethink whether or not he should resume his previous duties. Meanwhile, Maya, who had been acting as Phoenix's assistant, announces that she will be returning to her home village to finish her training as a spirit medium.|$|E
5|$|On the October 10 {{episode of}} Raw, Heyman, on Lesnar's behalf, {{challenged}} Goldberg to a fight after the pair had been feuding {{for several months}} through social media and during promotional work for the WWE 2K17 video game, which featured Lesnar as the cover star and Goldberg as the pre-order bonus. Heyman stated that Goldberg was the one <b>blemish</b> on Lesnar's WWE career, as Goldberg had defeated Lesnar at WrestleMania XX in 2004. On the October 17 episode of Raw, Goldberg returned to the WWE after a twelve-year absence and accepted Lesnar's request for a fight with their match later scheduled for Survivor Series. On the final Raw before Survivor Series, Lesnar and Goldberg had a confrontation {{for the first time}} in twelve years, resulting in a brawl with security after Heyman insulted Goldberg's family. On November 20 at Survivor Series, Lesnar lost to Goldberg in 1 minute and 26 seconds, marking the first time in three years that Lesnar was pinned. The next night on Raw, Goldberg declared himself the first entrant in the 2017 Royal Rumble match. The following week on Raw, Heyman addressed the Survivor Series match, stating that they underestimated Goldberg and that the match was a humiliation and embarrassment for him and Lesnar, who would also be in the Royal Rumble as he has something to prove. Lesnar returned on the January 16 episode of Raw to confront other Royal Rumble participants, attacking Sami Zayn, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns. At the Royal Rumble on January 29, Lesnar entered at number 26 and went on to eliminate Enzo Amore, Dean Ambrose and Dolph Ziggler before confronting Goldberg, who entered at number 28 and quickly eliminated Lesnar after a spear.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Microscopists are {{familiar}} with many <b>blemishes</b> that fluorescence images can have due to dust and debris, glass flaws, uneven distribution of fluids or surface coatings, etc. Microarray scans show similar artefacts, which affect the analysis, particularly when one tries to detect subtle changes. However, most <b>blemishes</b> {{are hard to find}} by the unaided eye, particularly in high-density oligonucleotide arrays (HDONAs). Results We present a method that harnesses the statistical power provided by having several HDONAs available, which are obtained under similar conditions except for the experimental factor. This method "harshlights" <b>blemishes</b> and renders them evident. We find empirically that about 25 % of our chips are <b>blemished,</b> and we analyze the impact of masking them on screening for differentially expressed genes. Conclusion Experiments attempting to assess subtle expression changes should be carefully screened for <b>blemishes</b> on the chips. The proposed method provides investigators with a novel robust approach to improve the sensitivity of microarray analyses. By utilizing topological information to identify and mask <b>blemishes</b> prior to model based analyses, the method prevents artefacts from confounding the process of background correction, normalization, and summarization. </p...|$|R

25|$|The {{first day}} of the tour was a {{dramatic}} one, and it ended up being England’s most impressive one of the whole tour. Sri Lanka, having won the toss and chose to bat first, were reduced to 42/5 due to some highly impressive swing bowling by Matthew Hoggard. A 100 run partnership between Kumar Sangakkara (who top-scored with 92) and Prasanna Jayawardene (the keeper) followed to allow Sri Lanka to post a vaguely respectable score, but they were bowled out for 188. England made a confident reply, reaching 49/1 by the close of play, with the loss of Alastair Cook in the first over as the only <b>blemish.</b>|$|E
25|$|The England cricket team toured Australia in the 1990–91 {{season to}} play a five-match Test series against Australia for The Ashes. The Australians were the holders, having {{reclaimed}} the Ashes in England during the 1989 Ashes series, however the 1986-87 Ashes series, which was the previous series in Australia had been won by England. The English tourists were confident their home series loss in 1989 had been a <b>blemish</b> {{and that they were}} more than capable of reclaiming the Ashes 'down under'. The tourists were seemingly well prepared. During their home summer they had 1-0 victories in 3-test series against both India and New Zealand, and had played well in their warm-up matches.|$|E
25|$|Other {{victories}} {{that year}} included a shutout victory over University of Tennessee Volunteers and a blow out of cross town rival Transylvania College.

The Sweetland-led Wildcats finished the year at 9–1 and outscored their opponents by a combined score of 261 to 29 with the only <b>blemish</b> being a 15–6 loss to North Carolina A The gridiron success was more remarkable considering Sweetland became ill during the season and was feared that he could not continue to coach the football team.
