5|$|The {{pre-production}} Griffon I {{shared the}} R engine's <b>bore</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke,</b> but was otherwise {{a completely new}} design that first ran in the Experimental Department in November 1939. Although this single engine was never flown, the production version, the Griffon II, first flew in 1941 installed in the Fairey Firefly. A {{significant difference between the}} R and the production Griffon was the re-location of the camshaft and supercharger drives {{to the front of the}} engine to reduce overall length. Another length-reducing measure was the use of a single magneto (the R had two, mounted at the rear), this again was moved to the front of the engine.|$|E
25|$|The Class GL {{made use}} of Beyer, Peacock's {{standard}} lever-actuated Sterling-type steam-operated power reverser and a Pyle National Company turbo-generator. The piston valves were modern straight-ported types with long-lap, long-travel valves, used {{for the first time}} in a South African Garratt which made the Class GL very free-running and more efficient than its predecessors. The cylinders, of the same <b>bore</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> as those of the Class 14, drove the third coupled axles using long connecting rods which stabilised the locomotive by reducing vertical forces at the crosshead to a minimum. This method of design became the standard on most Beyer-Garratts thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The 8C engine, {{first entered}} at the 1931 Mille Miglia road race through Italy, had a common crankcase, now with two alloy four-cylinder blocks, which also {{incorporated}} the heads. The <b>bore</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> (and hence rods, pistons and the like), {{were the same}} as the 6C 1750 (bore: 65mm, stroke: 88mm 2,336cc). There was no separate head, and no head gasket to fail, but this made valve maintenance more difficult. A central gear tower drove the overhead camshafts, superchargers and ancillaries. As far as production cars are concerned, the 8C engine powered two models, the 8C 2300 (1931–1935) and the even more rare and expensive 8C 2900 (1936–1941), bore increased to 68mm and stroke to 100mm (2,905cc).|$|E

25|$|In the 1930s Scott {{manufactured}} {{a number}} of stationary engines {{with the aim of}} raising funds following the decline in motorcycle sales. Some of these engines were derived from motorcycle units, for instance the DSE was a watercooled version of the Lightweight Squirrel engine and the SE had the same <b>bore</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> dimensions as the long stroke Flyers. It has come to light that the SE does not have the same bore size as the Long Stroke Flyer (73mm) but has a bore size of 78mm, this has been confirmed on two Scott SE engines. The PA stationary engine however was different. Designed to meet a Ministry requirement for a portable electrical generator for the Bofors anti-aircraft gun and its Kerrison Predictor, it was produced during the Second World War by both Scott and its former partners Jowett.|$|E
