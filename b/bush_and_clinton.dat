25|$|In 1992, Perot {{announced}} {{his intention to}} run for president and advocated a balanced budget, an end to the outsourcing of jobs, and the enactment of electronic direct democracy. A June 1992 Gallup poll showed Perot leading a three-way race against President Bush and presumptive Democratic nominee Bill Clinton. Perot briefly withdrew from the race in July, but re-entered the race in early October after he qualified for all 50 state ballots. He chose Admiral James Stockdale as his running mate and appeared in the 1992 CPD debates with <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clinton.</b> In the election, Perot won 18.9% of the popular vote but did not win any electoral votes. He won support from across the ideological and partisan spectrum, but performed best among self-described moderates. Perot ran for president again in 1996, establishing the Reform Party as a vehicle for his campaign. He won 8.4% of the popular vote against President Clinton and Republican nominee Bob Dole.|$|E

500|$|The {{effect of}} Ross Perot's {{candidacy}} {{has been a}} contentious point of debate for many years.

While many disaffected conservatives may have voted for Ross Perot to protest Bush's tax increase, further examination of the Perot vote in the Election Night exit polls not only showed that Perot siphoned votes nearly equally among <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clinton,</b> but of the voters who cited Bush's broken [...] "No New Taxes" [...] pledge as [...] "very important," [...] two thirds voted for Bill Clinton.|$|E

500|$|Former Pat Buchanan pollster Frank Luntz {{was hired}} by the campaign, along with former Republican National Campaign Committee {{chairman}} Charles Leonard. The New York Times reported that Perot sought the help of operatives to search court and federal documents to find information that might reflect poorly on the potential candidate so that preparations could be made to respond. In the final round of Democratic and Republican primaries, most notably in California, exit polls revealed that 42% of Republicans and 33% of Democrats favored Perot. A Time Magazine poll found that Perot had 37% support of all the electorate, ahead of both <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clinton</b> who tied for second at 24%. At this time, Vice President Dan Quayle became the most senior member of the Bush administration to criticize Perot, calling him a [...] "temperamental tycoon".|$|E
500|$|By May, Perot {{was leading}} presidential polls in both Texas and California. The <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clinton</b> campaigns became {{concerned}} about a candidacy, and publicly wondered if Perot could continue to [...] "play by his own rules". They attempted to downgrade Perot from his [...] "folk hero status" [...] {{to that of a}} politician, by highlighting his [...] "alleged character flaws". Meanwhile, Perot focused on sharpening his political positions as he promised. He hired John P. White, who served as a budget official under President Jimmy Carter, to work on his budget platform. Meanwhile, petition drives in every state reported that they had secured enough signatures to place Perot on the Election Day ballot. Speculation arose in the media that Perot would split the electoral college and force the United States House of Representatives to decide the presidency. Around this time, Hal Riney, who had worked on Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign and was known for the [...] "Morning in America" [...] ad, was hired as advertising consultant. When Riney revealed the cost of advertisements during a meeting, Perot reportedly [...] "flipped out", and asked [...] "Why would I spend that when I could go on the 'Today' show for free?" [...] Riney produced several ads during the campaign that never aired.|$|E
500|$|Perot {{participated in}} the first of three presidential debates for the 1992 election, on October 11 in Clayton, Missouri, along with George Bush and Bill Clinton. It {{was the first time that}} a third party {{candidate}} was involved in a national televised debate since John B. Anderson in 1980, and was the first presidential debate to ever feature three candidates. During the event, Perot discussed a wide range of issues including the budget deficit, education and drug use, and proclaimed that as president, he would eliminate the influence of lobbyists. He also had a few memorable quips. When asked to address detractors' criticism of his lack of government experience, he remarked: [...] "Well, they've got a point. I don't have any experience running up a $4 trillion debt." [...] When discussing what would happen if one of his opponents won, he commented: [...] "then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do. I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music here tonight." [...] After the debate, three out of four polls declared Perot as the winner. The average of all four showed Perot at 37% followed by Clinton with 30% and Bush with 18%, but election polls still showed Perot in third with 14%, far behind both <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clinton.</b> His running mate, James Stockdale, participated in a Vice Presidential debate in Atlanta, with fellow Vice Presidential nominee Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle. Largely unknown to the general public, Stockdale memorably opened the debate by unexpectedly asking the philosophical question, [...] "Who am I? Why am I here?" [...] He was unprepared to deal with some of the substantive issues raised, and his struggling performance may have damaged the Perot campaign.|$|E

2500|$|After Bill Clinton {{secured the}} Democratic Party's {{nomination}} {{in the spring}} of 1992, polls showed Ross Perot leading the race, followed by President <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clinton</b> in third place after a grueling nomination process. Two-way trial heats between <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clinton</b> in early 1992 showed Bush in the lead, however. But as the economy continued to grow sour and the President's approval rating continued to slide, the Democrats began to rally around their nominee. On July 9, 1992, Clinton chose Tennessee Senator and former 1988 Presidential candidate Al Gore to be his running mate. As Governor Clinton's nomination acceptance speech approached, Ross Perot dropped out of the race, convinced that staying in the race with a [...] "revitalized Democratic Party" [...] would cause the race to be decided by the United States House of Representatives. Clinton gave his acceptance speech on July 16, 1992, promising to bring a [...] "new covenant" [...] to America, and to work to heal the gap that had developed between {{the rich and the poor}} during the Reagan/Bush years. The Clinton campaign received the biggest convention [...] "bounce" [...] in history which brought him from 25 percent in the spring, behind Bush and Perot, to 55 percent versus Bush's 31 percent.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Anderson Cooper on November 3, 2010, when discussing cuts in government spending for Medicare and Social Security suggested by Congressman Paul Ryan, Bachmann was asked what cuts in government spending she would make to reduce the deficit. She cited President Obama's then-upcoming visit to Asia as an example, saying it [...] "is expected to cost the taxpayers $200million a day. He's taking two thousand people with him. He'll be renting out over 870 rooms in India. And these are 5-star hotel rooms at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel. This {{is the kind of}} over-the-top spending, it's a very small example, Anderson." [...] Bachmann was apparently referring to information in a story from the Press Trust of India, attributed to [...] "a top official of the Maharashtra Government privy to the arrangements for the high-profile visit", information that was also published in U.S.-based media such as The Drudge Report. In response to the news report's claim that 34 warships were accompanying the President, a Pentagon spokesman, Geoff Morrell, dismissed the account as [...] "comical". The White House said that the press report figures were [...] "wildly inflated" [...] and had [...] "no basis in reality". While stating that they could not give the actual projected figures for security reasons, staffers maintained costs were in line with the official travel costs of previous presidents <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clinton.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{effect of}} Ross Perot's {{candidacy}} {{has been a}} contentious point of debate for many years. In the ensuing months after the election, various Republicans asserted that Perot had acted as a spoiler, enough {{to the detriment of}} Bush to lose him the election. While many disaffected conservatives may have voted for Ross Perot to protest Bush's tax increase, further examination of the Perot vote in the Election Night exit polls not only showed that Perot siphoned votes nearly equally among <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clinton,</b> but roughly two-thirds of those voters who cited Bush's broken [...] "No New Taxes" [...] pledge as [...] "very important" [...] (25%) [...] voted for Bill Clinton. The voting numbers reveal that to win the electoral vote Bush would have had to win 10 of the 11 states Clinton won by less than five percentage points. For Bush to earn a majority of the popular vote, he would have needed 12.2% of Perot's 18.9% of the vote, 65% of Perot's support base. State exit polls suggested that Perot did not alter the electoral college count, except potentially in one state (Ohio), which nonetheless showed a result in the margin of error. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. NAFTA played a role in Perot's support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot-button social issues.|$|E
