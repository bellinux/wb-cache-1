40|$|Published: 18 February 2014 The {{success of}} {{slaughter}} lamb enterprises is {{heavily influenced by}} {{the ability of the}} <b>breeding</b> <b>ewe</b> to produce a lamb annually across variable environments. It has been shown that by maintaining heavier weight and condition across the annual production cycle producers can make significant improvements in maternal performance. This paper follows on from a previous analysis of crossbred ewes within the Maternal Central Progeny Test and examines the potential to select for reduced fluctuation in weight and fat across the production cycle. A cubic spline model was fitted to the weight and fat score data from the first three parities of 2688 first-cross ewes. The analysis partitioned the influence of environment, reproduction and genetic effects on the shape of the weight and fat score splines across three parities. Yearly and seasonal variation in feed supply and the demands of raising a lamb are the major influences on fluctuations in the weight and fat score of the <b>breeding</b> <b>ewe.</b> The genetic effects were constant across time with 98 and 92 % of the genetic variation for weight and fat, respectively, associated with the spline’s intercept. In agreement with the findings of the first paper of the series it can be concluded that genetic lines do not re-rank for weight or fat score over time. The influence of sire breed on weight and fat score was constant across time with sire breeds fluctuating in parallel across time. As a result it is concluded that to avoid low fat reserves and the subsequent low fertility during the ‘tough’ periods, selection to improve ewe body condition could be made at any time and under any environmental conditions.

The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the genetic variation in liveweight and body condition of Merino ewes across their breeding life within a wool-based enterprise. The results were consistent with findings in crossbred ewes and showed that the genetic component of weight and body condition remained constant across the production cycle and age. The overall additive genetic effect accounted for 92 % of the genetic variation in weight of Merino ewes bred across five production cycles. A genetic correlation of 0. 85 suggested that ewes that were superior at maintaining their condition when rearing a single lamb would maintain this superiority when rearing multiple lambs. To improve weight and condition of Merino ewes during the ‘tough’ times, when nutrient requirements are not met by the pasture, selection can be made at any time and this will result in increased genetic condition at all times.

40|$|A {{favourable}} phenotypic {{relationship between}} ewe body condition and reproduction {{has been well}} reported in literature with producers managing ewe condition to improve reproductive performance. This thesis explores the genetic variation of ewe body composition across her production life {{and the ability to}} select for it to improve the maternal performance of the ewe in variable environments. The quantitative genetic analyses were carried out on four data sets; 1. Maternal Central Progeny Test provided data on 2, 846 first cross ewes that were the progeny of Merino ewes crossed to multiple maternal sire breeds. Weight, fat score, fleece traits and reproductive traits were recorded over three production cycles. 2. The Trangie D flock incorporated 3, 300 Merino ewes from five strains (Fine-wool, Medium-wool Peppin, Medium-wool non-Peppin, High fertility Peppin and South Australian strong wool). The weight and body condition score of the ewes were recorded over five production cycles. 3. An industry stud flock (Lambpro, Holbrook NSW) provided ultrasound scan measurements on 2, 796 adult maternal composite ewes from 2010 to 2013. The industry flock is based around a high fertility maternal composite flock focussed on providing self-replacing ewes to the prime lamb industry. 4. The final data set includes 6, 347 Scottish Blackface ewes which were managed in the Scottish highlands, UK. The ewes were ultrasound scanned as lambs before being managed as part of the breeding flock for an average of four production cycles. The body condition score and reproductive performance was recorded across their production life. Multiple analysis techniques were used to demonstrate that the genetic rank of individuals was consistent across maturities, measurements times, parities, environments and reproductive status. An individual's genetic rank for weight, fat and condition were highly consistent across the ewe's production life. Consequently, the results suggest that selection against fluctuations in the weight and body composition profiles of the <b>breeding</b> <b>ewe</b> will not be effective. Adult fat and muscle are moderately heritable whilst body condition score and fat score were low to moderately heritable providing scope to improve the ewe's condition during the production cycle. Post-weaning weight and body composition traits were strongly correlated with the corresponding adult traits' Therefore selection practiced on young animal traits will improve the lifetime condition of the ewe. Neither fibre diameter nor fleece weight influenced the magnitude of weight and fat fluctuations across the production cycle. Fibre diameter was moderately correlated with fat so finer fleeced sheep were leaner. The genetic relationship between body composition traits and maternal productivity was weak. Under "tough" conditions the relationship was positive and yet when faced with favourable conditions the relationship was weakly antagonistic. Selection on post-weaning fat depth will result in improved genetic merit for body condition in the <b>breeding</b> <b>ewe.</b> However, selection for fat will not alone improve reproductive performance and in favourable nutritional conditions can become antagonistic to maternal productivity. ln highly variable environments or feed limited production systems there maybe merit in selecting for increased condition to improve both the welfare and productivity of the ewe.

40|$|One way {{to improve}} {{reproductive}} performance of ewes is through extending its lifetime productivity. <b>Breeding</b> <b>ewe</b> lambs is one method of improving the reproductive performance in the sheep. In order to produce an offspring when the ewe lamb is approximately 1 yr of age, the autumn-born ewe must obtain puberty before the autumn breeding season begins. Onset of puberty is determined by integration of {{both internal and external}} factors, which then enable the neuroendocrine or hormonal event occur (Shirley et al., 2001). Age, photoperiod and body weight are the principal factors influencing puberty. The age at onset of the reproductive activity in the sheep is different among the various breeds. In the Sarda lambs the age of the onset of puberty is about 7 - 8 months. However the animals that have this age don’t reach the puberty if photoperiod and body weight are not suitable. Both the female lambs born in October-November and in February reach puberty in the same subsequent autumn breeding season. This reproductive behaviour evidences that photoperiod {{plays an important role in}} the onset of puberty (Papachristoforou et al., 2000). The female lambs born in later spring uneasily reach puberty within the subsequent breeding season, although photoperiod is favourable. This retard in the onset of reproductive activity is due to the attainment of the body maturity only during subsequent long day period but they reach reproductive activity only during the autumn of the subsequent year (Foster et al., 1985).

40|$|Published: 11 April 2014 The Australian sheep {{industry}} has historically made rapid {{advances in the}} quality and quantity of meat and wool through genetic improvement, but unfortunately, maternal performance, i. e. number of lambs weaned, is well below desired levels. The aim of the present paper is to investigate the potential to select for increased weight and fat across the production cycle to improve maternal performance. The analysis explores the potential to improve the weight and fat score of breeding ewes during ‘tough’ periods (i. e. when nutrient requirements are not met by the pasture), preparing the <b>breeding</b> <b>ewe</b> for the upcoming mating without an increase in overall ewe size. The 2846 ewes within the maternal central progeny test were weighed and scored for fatness 12 times across three production cycles. Low to moderate heritability estimates for weight (0. 04 – 0. 23) and fat (0. 02 – 0. 06) changes across the production cycle provide little hope for selection against weight loss during tough periods. The analysis showed very strong genetic correlations between time-points across multiple production cycles for both weight (0. 99 – 0. 93) and fat score (0. 88 – 0. 98). The very strong correlations between measurements suggest that weight and fat score are genetically the same trait throughout the ewe’s adult life. With 74 % and 77 % of the genetic variation in weight and fat, respectively, constant across the production cycle, there is little opportunity to select against the natural fluctuations in weight and fat reserves. In conclusion, selection for increased fat can be made at any time and it will result in more fat during tough times. S. F. Walkom, F. D. Brien, M. L. Hebart, N. M. Fogarty, S. Hatcher and W. S.
