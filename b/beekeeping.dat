5|$|<b>Beekeeping</b> is {{described}} in detail by Virgil in his Eclogues; it is also mentioned in his Aeneid, and in Pliny's Natural History.|$|E
5|$|From the 1920s {{through the}} 1970s the {{laboratory}} was used mainly for faculty and graduate research, with two courses offered to undergraduate students in introductory and advanced <b>beekeeping</b> {{as well as}} a single course offered to the public in the summers. There was a brief time in the spring semesters of 2001 and 2002 that an introductory course in <b>beekeeping</b> was offered, however, with the reorganization of the department of entomology these classes have since ceased.|$|E
5|$|Human <b>beekeeping</b> or {{apiculture}} {{has been}} practised for millennia, {{since at least}} the times of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. Apart from honey and pollination, honey bees produce beeswax, royal jelly and propolis. Bees have appeared in mythology and folklore, through all phases of art and literature, from ancient times to the present day, though primarily focused in the Northern Hemisphere, where <b>beekeeping</b> is far more common.|$|E
5|$|In {{the time}} that Gates was there, {{research}} focused mainly on honey production, brood diseases, wax extraction and horticultural pollination in the cucumber and cranberry industries. From 1913 to 1920 the laboratory was also operated by a superintendent, John L. Byard, hired on by Gates to maintain the facilities {{from day to day}} as well as perform wax extractions and other services to beekeepers from around the state. Following Gates' resignation in 1918, the school ceased to offer its summer <b>beekeeping</b> school, many of its state extension services, and the college went through several different professors before hiring Frank R. Shaw as the new professor of <b>beekeeping</b> in 1931. With Shaw's retirement in 1969, the laboratory was rededicated to urban and medical entomology research, with the former <b>beekeeping</b> program falling into relative obscurity.|$|E
5|$|Kit Williams' {{treasure}} hunt book The Bee on the Comb (1984) uses bees and <b>beekeeping</b> {{as part of}} its story and puzzle.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the novel}} emphasises Brooke's {{sexuality}} and his understanding of love. Additionally, the novel contrasts the various elements of English upper- and lower-class life during the Edwardian period. Other notable elements {{of the novel}} include the vivid descriptions of the life in Grantchester and the borrowing of themes from Brooke's poetry such as <b>beekeeping.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{outbreak of}} colony losses spread from the Isle of Wight {{to the rest}} of the UK in 1906. These losses later were attributed to a combination of factors, including adverse weather, intensive apiculture leading to inadequate forage, and a new infection, the chronic bee paralysis virus, but at the time, the cause of this agricultural <b>beekeeping</b> problem was similarly mysterious and unknown.|$|E
5|$|Both events, not {{connected}} publicly for several weeks, caused the curious {{to visit the}} website ilovebees.com. The site, which appeared to be dedicated to honey sales and <b>beekeeping,</b> was covered in confusing random characters and sentence fragments. Dana, the ostensible webmaster of the ilovebees site, created a weblog stating that something had gone wrong with her website, and the site itself had been hacked. Suspecting {{that this was a}} mystery that could be unraveled, Halo and ARG fans spread the link and began to work on figuring out what was going on.|$|E
5|$|Linnæus {{was born}} in the village of Råshult in Småland, Sweden, on 23 May 1707. He was the first child of Nicolaus (Nils) Ingemarsson (who later adopted the family name Linnæus) and Christina Brodersonia. His {{siblings}} were Anna Maria Linnæa, Sofia Juliana Linnæa, Samuel Linnæus (who would eventually succeed their father as rector of Stenbrohult and write a manual on <b>beekeeping),</b> and Emerentia Linnæa.|$|E
5|$|Since U.S. {{beekeeper}} Nephi Miller {{first began}} moving his hives to {{different areas of}} the country for the winter of 1908, migratory <b>beekeeping</b> has become widespread in America. Bee rental for pollination is a crucial element of U.S. agriculture, which could not produce anywhere near its current levels with native pollinators alone. U.S. beekeepers collectively earn much more from renting their bees out for pollination than they do from honey production.|$|E
5|$|The Apiary Laboratory, {{more often}} {{referred}} to as the Apiary, is a research laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Originally built for the study of honey bees and apiculture, today it is primarily used to study native pollinator species and the chemicals and pathogens impacting their populations. This academic building is unique in that it is credited as being the first in the United States to be erected exclusively for the teaching of <b>beekeeping.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of certain chemical substances—such as ethanol or pesticides or defensive toxic biochemicals produced by plants—to a bee's environment {{can cause the}} bee to display abnormal or unusual behavior and disorientation. In sufficient quantities, such chemicals can poison and even kill the bee. The effects of alcohol on bees have long been recognized. For example, John Cumming described the effect in an 1864 publication on <b>beekeeping.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of CCD are still unknown, but many causes {{are currently being}} considered, such as pesticides, mites, fungi, <b>beekeeping</b> practices (such {{as the use of}} antibiotics or long-distance transportation of beehives), malnutrition, poor quality queens, starvation, other pathogens, and immunodeficiencies. The current scientific consensus is that no single factor is causing CCD, but that some of these factors in combination may lead to CCD either additively or synergistically.|$|E
5|$|Banksia sessilis has a {{somewhat}} complicated taxonomic history. It was collected from King George Sound in 1801 and described by Robert Brown in 1810 as Dryandra floribunda, a name {{by which it}} was known for many years. However, Joseph Knight had published the name Josephia sessilis in 1809, which had precedence due to its earlier date, and the specific name was formalised in 1924. Four varieties are recognised. It is a prickly plant with little apparent horticultural potential, {{and none of the}} varieties are commonly seen in cultivation. A profuse producer of nectar, B.sessilis is valuable to the <b>beekeeping</b> industry.|$|E
5|$|Contract {{pollination}} has overtaken {{the role}} of honey production for beekeepers in many countries. From 1972 to 2006, feral honey bees declined dramatically in the US, and they are now almost absent. The number of colonies kept by beekeepers declined slightly, through urbanization, systematic pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and the closure of <b>beekeeping</b> businesses. In 2006 and 2007 the rate of attrition increased, and was described as colony collapse disorder. In 2010 invertebrate iridescent virus and the fungus Nosema ceranae were shown to be in every killed colony, and deadly in combination. Winter losses increased to about 1/3. Varroa mites {{were thought to be}} responsible for about half the losses.|$|E
5|$|Evaluating {{pesticide}} {{contributions to}} CCD is particularly difficult for several reasons. First, {{the variety of}} pesticides in use in the different areas reporting CCD {{makes it difficult to}} test for all possible pesticides simultaneously. Second, many commercial <b>beekeeping</b> operations are mobile, transporting hives over large geographic distances {{over the course of a}} season, potentially exposing the colonies to different pesticides at each location. Third, the bees themselves place pollen and honey into long-term storage, effectively meaning a delay may occur from days to months before contaminated provisions are fed to the colony, negating any attempts to associate the appearance of symptoms with the actual time when exposure to pesticides occurred.|$|E
5|$|However, {{even though}} on a per-individual basis, many other species are {{actually}} more efficient at pollinating, on the 30% of crop types where honey bees are used, most native pollinators cannot be mass-utilized as easily or {{as effectively as}} honey bees—in many instances they will not visit the plants at all. Beehives can be moved from crop to crop as needed, and the bees will visit many plants in large numbers, compensating via saturation pollination for what they lack in efficiency. The commercial viability of these crops is therefore strongly tied to the <b>beekeeping</b> industry. In China, hand pollination of apple orchards is labor-intensive, time consuming, and costly.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by the National Institute of <b>Beekeeping</b> in Bologna, Italy, found pollen obtained from seeds dressed with imidacloprid contain significant levels of the insecticide, and suggested the polluted pollen might cause honey bee colony death. Analysis of maize and sunflower crops originating from seeds dressed with imidacloprid suggest large amounts of the insecticide will be carried back to honey bee colonies. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in sucrose solution have also been documented to affect homing and foraging activity of honey bees. Imidacloprid in sucrose solution fed to bees in the laboratory impaired their communication for a few hours. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in laboratory and field experiment decreased flight activity and olfactory discrimination, and olfactory learning performance was impaired.|$|E
5|$|Msambweni {{grew from}} a small village into a bustling little town. Fishing is {{important}} to the local community of Msambweni and is the primary source of income. The area is mainly Muslim and inhabited by Digo peoples. The Kwake District Development Plan 2002–2008 attempted to improve fish landing sites and beach access for fisherman on the coast of Msambweni. Coconut palm is grown, as are cashew nuts, fruits and buxa coloring. Maize, cassava, cowpeas and rice are grown for domestic consumption. There are numerous stalls along the main road in the town selling fruit and vegetables. Silica sand is mined at Msambweni and transported to Nairobi to make bottle glass. <b>Beekeeping</b> and seaweed farming are also local occupation and its commercialization in the area has been supported by ACT! Kenya with financial assistance from the European Union.|$|E
25|$|The American Honey Queen Program is a {{national}} competition sponsored by the American <b>Beekeeping</b> Federation (ABF) with the main priorities of promoting the practice of <b>beekeeping,</b> increasing the national honey consumption, and educating {{the public about the}} value of honey bees. A queen and princess are crowned each year, serving as representatives of the entire <b>beekeeping</b> industry in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|<b>Beekeeping</b> {{in ancient}} China has existed since ancient times {{and appears to}} be untraceable to its origin. In the book Golden Rules of Business Success written by Fan Li (or Tao Zhu Gong) during the Spring and Autumn period, some parts mention the art of <b>beekeeping</b> and the {{importance}} {{of the quality of the}} wooden box for <b>beekeeping</b> that can affect the quality of its honey.|$|E
25|$|P. gibbosus {{presents}} {{a challenge for}} beekeepers. Because of its tendency to prey on honey-producing bees, P. gibbosus {{has been known to}} attack <b>beekeeping</b> sites. This complicates the process of <b>beekeeping</b> and hinders honey production.|$|E
25|$|<b>Beekeeping</b> in the United States {{dates back}} to the 1860s.|$|E
25|$|Though Africanized bees display certain {{behavioral}} {{traits that}} make them less than desirable for commercial <b>beekeeping,</b> excessive defensiveness and swarming foremost, they have now become the dominant type of honey bee for <b>beekeeping</b> in Central and South America due to their genetic dominance as well as ability to out-compete their European counterpart, with some beekeepers asserting that they are superior honey producers and pollinators.|$|E
25|$|Caddy, a hamlet 3 {{miles north}} of the Randalstown centre, was site of a new school in 1908. and also a centre of <b>beekeeping</b> in the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Major {{investments}} {{are made in}} food; beverages, engineering, and mechanical goods. Other rural industries in this district are carpentry, blacksmith, leather, pottery, <b>beekeeping,</b> stone cutting, handlooms, agarbathi, and sandalwood carving.|$|E
25|$|The {{agriculture}} and livestock industry only represented 0.15% of the economy. The main activities are dairy farming, market gardening (flower farming and organic vegetavle farming), poultry and <b>beekeeping,</b> organized in small and medium enterprises (SMEs).|$|E
25|$|Many {{practical}} {{tips and}} recommendations {{are found in}} Kovalevsky's works which are still applicable today. For example, suggestions are found about growing rice and tea, cultivation of dry land, anti-desertification measures, and <b>beekeeping.</b> He was also decisively opposed to using excess mineral fertilizer.|$|E
25|$|A bee smoker, {{usually called}} simply a smoker, is a device used in <b>beekeeping</b> to calm honey bees. It is {{designed}} to generate smoke from the smouldering of various fuels, hence the name. The first bee smoker, which incorporated a bellows with a fire pot, was invented in 1870 by the renowned American beekeeper, Moses Quinby.|$|E
25|$|The {{province}} of Erzurum {{has the highest}} ratio of meadows and pastures in Turkey, ideal for livestock. However, once the main occupation, animal husbandry lost its importance in the 1980s {{with the introduction of}} a liberal economy and the importation of animal products. A large organized industrial park concentrating on processing meat is being built with the hope of reviving this sector. Food industries include <b>beekeeping</b> and trout farming.|$|E
25|$|<b>Beekeeping</b> was {{traditionally}} practiced for the bees' honey harvest, although nowadays crop pollination {{service can}} often provide a {{greater part of}} a commercial beekeeper's income. Other hive products are pollen, royal jelly, and propolis, which are also used for nutritional and medicinal purposes, and beeswax, which is used in candle making, cosmetics, wood polish, and for modelling. The modern use of hive products has changed little since ancient times.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of honeydew honey has some complications and dangers. This honey {{has a much}} larger proportion of indigestibles than light floral honeys, thus causing dysentery to the bees, resulting {{in the death of}} colonies in areas with cold winters. Good <b>beekeeping</b> management requires the removal of honeydew prior to winter in colder areas. Bees collecting this resource also have to be fed protein supplements, as honeydew lacks the protein-rich pollen accompaniment gathered from flowers.|$|E
25|$|In {{central and}} {{southern}} Africa there was formerly no tradition of <b>beekeeping,</b> and the hive was destroyed in order to harvest the honey, pollen and larvae. The bees adapted to the climate of sub-Saharan Africa, including prolonged droughts. Having to defend themselves against aggressive insects such as ants and wasps, as well as voracious animals like the honey badger, African Bees evolved as a race of highly defensive bees unsuitable {{by a number of}} metrics for domestic use.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Israel and India {{signed the}} Agriculture Cooperation Agreement, which {{established}} the Indo-Israel Agricultural Cooperation Project. The project's central {{aim is to}} utilize Israeli technology to increase crop productivity and diversity in various regions in India. The implementation of the project occurs through establishment of agricultural centers of excellence in India that focus on growing horticulture crops, producing seeds and cut-flowers, and also on <b>beekeeping</b> and dairy farming. As of 2015, 15 centers of excellence are fully operational, spanning 10 Indian states.|$|E
25|$|After the 1973 war, {{the city}} of Quneitra and some villages of the {{occupied}} Syrian Golan Heights were liberated. Among the liberated villages after being occupied for almost 6 years, was Ber Ajam. Now that he was unemployed, Said {{decided to return to}} settle there and restore the house with his family. Said lives there still, working in <b>beekeeping,</b> agriculture, and keeping up with the intellectual activities, and abreast of developments and discussions in the Arab, Islamic, and global arena.|$|E
25|$|Historically, Vilayet {{produced}} millet. It {{was also}} a major wine producer. Both wine and brandy were made in small amounts. The vilayet also produced flax and hemp. Van also had a major sheep herding industry. As of 1906, there were over 3 million sheep in the vilayet. As of 1920, those numbers were reduced. <b>Beekeeping</b> was done by peasants, with honey being frozen and sold. The area also produced coal, lead, copper and borax, orpiment, gas, granite, lime, chalk, gypsum, gold, and salt.|$|E
