6000|$|The grey {{girl had}} {{gone over to}} a dirty <b>bassinette</b> where a half-naked child sprawled. An ugly little girl with fat red cheeks {{was sitting on a}} stool beside it, close to an open locker wherein could be seen a number of old meat bones.' ...|$|E
60|$|His words multiplied, his {{importance}} increased. In {{a little}} while he was restored to something of his old self. He was enormously excited. He seemed unable to sit down anywhere. He came into the breakfast-room so soon as Kipps was sure of him, shook hands with Mrs. Kipps parenthetically, sat down and immediately got up again. He went to the <b>bassinette</b> {{in the corner and}} looked absentmindedly at Kipps, junior, and said he was glad if only for the youngster's sake. He immediately resumed the thread of his discourse.... He drank a cup of coffee noisily and walked up and down the room talking, while they attempted breakfast amidst the gale of his excitement. The infant slept marvellously through it all.|$|E
6000|$|Then Euphemia had {{a really}} pretty fancy. She {{procured}} {{one of those big}} open garden baskets and painted it a pleasant brown, and instead of a garden fork she had a little half horticultural scoop. In this basket she kept her coals, and she tied a pink ribbon on the handle. One might fancy she had been in some dewy garden and had dug a few coals as one might dig up bulbs, and brought them in and put them down. It attracted attention from all her visitors, and set a kind of fashion in the neighbourhood. For a time Euphemia was almost contented. But one day a malignant woman called, and looked at this device through her gilt eye-glasses, while she secretly groped in the dark of her mind for an unpleasant thing to say. Then suddenly she remarked, [...] "Why not put your coal in a <b>bassinette?</b> Or keep it all on the floor?" [...] Euphemia's face fell. The thing was undeniably very like a cradle, in the light of this suggestion; the coal certainly did seem a little out of place there; and besides, if there were more than three or four lumps they had a way of tumbling over the edge upon the carpet when the fire was replenished. The tender shoot of Euphemia's satisfaction suddenly withered and died.|$|E

5000|$|It wasn't {{until the}} 19th century that infant beds {{developed}} from <b>bassinettes,</b> acquiring a role {{of keeping the}} child in their bed. The development of a distinction between infant beds and <b>bassinettes</b> was natural because it was [...] "considered vital that the child's bed be raised off the ground." [...] This was due to a perception of noxious fumes below knee level, and explosive vapours near the ceiling, with good air in between. Once children's beds were raised off the ground {{the role of the}} sides changed from a convenience to a safety feature.|$|R
5000|$|... "Largest {{completely}} new hospital {{of its kind}} constructed in North America; 765000 sq ft of floor space; 2,000 rooms. Patient capacity: 766 beds, 116 <b>bassinettes,</b> 15 day care beds. Staff when the hospital is in full operation: 1,200-1,500. Cost: $21,000,000 for construction of hospital, School of Nursing and Power Plant — $5,000,000 for initial equipment. T-shaped hospital building, 12 storeys plus basement. The cross-piece of the T includes all nursing units. The back wing, or stem of the T, is 10 storeys high and includes all clinical and other service departments. A 100 bed auxiliary hospital is planned for later construction on site; also a 370 bed psychiatric hospital which will be operated under separate administration. Capital financing for construction was by the usual Federal Provincial grants plus a $17 million debenture issue to be retired by the Provincial Government over a 20-year period. Operation costs will be met by the standard per diem payments made under Alberta Hospitalization Benefits. Complete hospital control is vested in the board of Management." ...|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "crib" [...] {{was used}} to {{describe}} a slatted, high-sided child's bed.It derives from the Old English word [...] "" [...] which means [...] "manger" [...] (food trough, referring {{to the shape of}} a <b>bassinette)</b> or stall (implying coralling the child).|$|E
50|$|Months later, a very {{pregnant}} Beth {{goes into}} labor and {{is taken to}} the hospital by Annette, Gina and Melissa. That night, Beth wakes up to the emergency alarms going off in the maternity ward. She gets up and goes to check on her baby, but the <b>bassinette</b> is empty. The film ends with Lydia, Johnny and Mother leaving the country in the RV with Beth's baby.|$|E
50|$|A bassinet, <b>bassinette,</b> or cradle is a bed {{specifically}} for babies {{from birth to}} about four months. Bassinets are generally designed to work with fixed legs or casters, while cradles are generally {{designed to provide a}} rocking or gliding motion. Bassinets and cradles are distinguished from Moses baskets and carry cots, which are designed to be carried and sit directly on the floor or furniture. After four months, babies are often transferred to a crib (North American usage) or cot (UK usage). In the United States, however, the bedside sleeper is the prevalent option, since they are generally bigger, recommended up to 6 months, and often used up to a year.|$|E
5000|$|Iron beds were {{developed}} in 17th century Italy to address concerns about bed bug infestation and moths. This new application was quickly extended to children's beds - a rockable iron <b>bassinette</b> (with spear-like corner posts) has been dated to 1620-1640. Proponents promoted the supposed health benefits of iron beds. Infant beds constructed from metal became popular during the later half of the 19th century. [...] Infant beds (and bassinettes) constructed from iron with mesh or chain sides were common. Childcare experts gave iron beds their approval because it was hygienic material (compared with wood) and could not [...] "habour vermin", of which bed bug infestation, lice and moths were cited concerns. [...] Commonly painted with a white vitreous enamel, later manufacturers working with wood continued to paint in the now traditional white; unfortunately this was often lead paint, and children were notorious for chewing and sucking the sweet surface.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} effects of mother-infant close-contact while on the {{postnatal}} ward on the maternal perception of the onset of lactogenesis phase II (LII). The 'Got Milk?' project utilized a sub-sample of 49 mothers of newly delivered infants participating in a large randomised trial (The North-East Cot Trial) which had allocated the mother-infant dyads to receive either a stand-alone <b>bassinette</b> (current hospital practices) or a side-car crib (a three sided <b>bassinette</b> that attaches to the mother's bed) while on the postnatal ward. Data were collected using simple daily home diaries completed immediately following birth until five days postpartum. Mothers of infants assigned to located the side-car crib condition reported experiencing: the onset of LII earlier (p= 0. 003); more physiological sensations of LII on reported day of milk arrival (p= 0. 025); and were discharged earlier from hospital (p= 0. 042), in comparison to mothers whose infants were allocated the stand-alone <b>bassinette</b> condition. There was a clear trend for infants in the side-car crib group to breastfeed more frequently than infants in the stand-alone <b>bassinette</b> group. Multifarious mothers, regardless of cot allocation, reported experiencing: the onset of LII sooner (p= 0. 046); a greater frequency of breastfeeding (p= 0. 026); and a greater confidence in breastfeeding their infant (p= 0. 003), sooner than primiparous mothers. This study contributes to the growing understanding of the effects current Western postnatal infant care practices on the breastfeeding physiology in the immediate postpartum period. Side-car cribs allow mother-infant close-contact which facilitates an earlier onset of LI...|$|E
40|$|Until {{relatively}} recently, {{studies in}} this field emphasized the physical events surrounding {{the transfer of the}} infant from the uterus to the <b>bassinette.</b> Current investigators are devoting much more attention to intrauterine and early neonatal environment. This {{is not to say that}} mechanical factors should be forgotten or that they are unimportant, but that there seem to be factors as yet unknown which in modern practice may make a significantly greater contribution to the problem of brain damage than does direct obstetric trauma...|$|E

40|$|My {{premise is}} very simple: The {{sciences}} {{are an integral}} part of the liberal arts, and the non-sciences are integral to the sciences as liberal arts. Given the long, rich history of the academy—from the universities of Paris and Oxford to today—sectoring inquiry, knowledge, and professional training into discrete disciplines, the simple premise is problematic. Most of us are trained in one discipline, perhaps two, and strongly encouraged to remain not only within our specific discipline, but even our specialized, sub-disciplinary niche. Some time in the previous millennium (1972 to be precise), just twelve weeks after completing my undergraduate degree in biology, I began my graduate work in human genetics. We were strongly encouraged to participate in Genetics Grand Rounds, offered weekly—an opportunity to put faces and personal dimensions to the genetic conditions we were studying. At one of the first sessions, a pediatrician took us to the neonatal intensive care unit. Already from the doorway we could see a <b>bassinette</b> at the back of the unit, the only one not coupled to copious state-of-the-art technology. As we approached, it was readily apparent that this infant with a grotesquely misshaped hea...|$|E
