5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{are both}} open for fishing. The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) has {{established}} fishing regulations, such as catch and length limits, that {{are meant to}} enhance sport fisheries in public waters such as Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River. The NCWRC has had regulations in place at Pettigrew State Park since 2002. The regulations specify that anglers may keep largemouth bass that are greater than 20inches (50.8cm) or between 14 and 16inches (35.6-40.6cm). This rule {{was put in place}} {{to increase the number of}} tropy fish, fish over 20inches (50.8cm). Additionally the NCWRC stocks Lake Phelps with bluegill and they have begun a program to reintroduce alewife and blueback herring via fish ladder on <b>Bee</b> <b>Tree</b> Canal from the Scuppernong River.|$|E

6000|$|If you cry aloud now to your friends, {{under the}} hilarious {{impression}} {{that you have}} Mooween sure at last, there is another surprise awaiting you. And that suggests a bit of advice, which is most pertinent: don't stand under the bear when you cry out. If he is a little fellow, he will shoot up the tree, faster than ever a jumping jack went up his stick, and hide in a cluster of leaves, as near the top as he can get. But {{if he is a}} big bear, he will tumble down on you before you know what has happened. No slow climbing for him; he just lets go and comes down by gravitation.

60|$|The {{food was}} {{what has been}} already named. The meat was venison, bear, raccoon, wild turkey, wild duck, and pheasant; the drink was water, or rye coffee, or whisky which the little stills {{everywhere}} supplied only too abundantly. Wheat bread was long unknown, and corn cakes of various makings and bakings supplied its place. The most delicious morsel of all was corn grated while still in the milk and fashioned into round cakes eaten hot from the clapboard before the fire, or from the mysterious depths of the Dutch oven, buried in coals and ashes on the hearth. There was soon a great flow of milk from the kine that multiplied in the pastures in the woods, and there was sweetening enough from the maple tree and the <b>bee</b> <b>tree,</b> but salt was very scarce and very dear, and long journeys were made through the perilous woods {{to and from the}} licks, or salt springs, which the deer had discovered before the white man or the red man knew them.|$|E

60|$|Winter after winter, the Williamses {{heard the}} wolves howling round {{them in the}} woods, and this music was {{familiar}} to the ears of all the Ohio pioneers, who trusted their rifles for both the safety and support of their families. They deadened the trees around them by girdling them with the ax, and planted the spaces between the leafless trunks with corn and beans and pumpkins. These were their necessaries, but they had an occasional luxury in the wild honey from the hollow of a <b>bee</b> <b>tree</b> when the bears had not got at it. In its season, there was an abundance of wild fruit, plums and cherries, haws and grapes, berries, and nuts of every kind, and the maples yielded all the sugar they chose to make from them. But it was long before they had, at any time, the profusion which our modern arts enable us to enjoy the whole year round, and in the hard beginnings the orchard and the garden were forgotten for the fields. Their harvests must pay for the acres bought of the government, or from some speculator who {{had never seen the}} land; and the settler must be prompt in paying, or else see his home pass from him after all his toil into the hands of strangers. He worked hard and he fared hard, and if he was safer when peace came, it is doubtful if he were otherwise more fortunate. As the game grew scarcer, it was no longer so easy to provide food for his family, the change from venison and wild turkey to the pork, which early began to prevail in his diet, was hardly a wholesome one. Besides, in cutting down the trees, he opened spaces to the sun which had been harmless enough {{in the shadow of the}} woods, but which now sent up their ague-breeding miasms. Ague was the scourge of the whole region, and it was hard to know whether the pestilence was worse on the rich levels beside the rivers, or on the stony hills where the settlers sometimes built to escape it. Fevers of several kinds prevailed, and consumption was common in the climates that ague spared. There was little knowledge of the rules of health, and little medical skill for those who lost it; most of the remedies for disease and accident were such only as home nursing and home treatment could supply.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis is {{the first}} assay that {{describes}} the isolation and identification of strains and species of Lactobacillus from the honey stomach of the Asiatic giant honeybee, Apis dorsata. Samples of honeybees were collected from A. dorsata colonies in different <b>bee</b> <b>trees,</b> and Lactobacillus was isolated from honey stomachs using selective media. The isolates were Gram-stained and tested for catalase reaction. The 16 S rRNA genes from extracted DNA of bacterial colonies were amplified with polymerase chain reaction using lactobacilli genus primers (27 F and 1492 R). All bacterial 16 S rRNA genes were sequenced and deposited in GenBank. The 34 isolated strains yielded three distinct rRNA sequences of 15 different strains. Lactobacillus sequences isolated from the bees' honey stomachs were comprised of Lactobacillus kunkeei related-sequences (56 %) with other abundant sequences being related to other Lactobacillus sp.

40|$|The idea of trait-based linkage {{analysis}} in half-sibs is extended {{by comparing the}} frequency of parental marker haplotypes in animals with different phenotypes. This article first presents the likelihood of observing different classes of paternal haplotypes in a half-sib family, where only family members of a certain phenotype (e. g., affected) are genotyped and are fully informative. The likelihood function is then generalized to multiple phenotypic categories. A linear predictor allows for discontinuous {{as well as for}} continuous phenotypes and other explanatory variables. Finally, how to incorporate not fully informative offspring and how to analyze super sister families are shown. Maximum-likelihood estimates of all parameters can be found by a Newton-Raphson algorithm, which mimics an iteratively weighted least-squares procedure. The method allows for any multilocus feasible mapping function and, among others, for situations with selective or nonselective genotyping, single or multiple traits, and continuous or categorical traits. No parameters are required to describe the mode of inheritance and the method copes with virtually any family size. Fields of applications are therefore mapping experiments in species with a high reproductive capacity, such as cattle, pigs, horses, honey <b>bees,</b> <b>trees,</b> and fish...|$|R
