5|$|Everything in Time (B-sides, Rarities, Remixes) is a {{compilation}} album comprising B-sides, remixes, and rare songs by the American third wave ska band No Doubt, first released on November 23, 2003 as disc three of No Doubt's box set, <b>Boom</b> <b>Box,</b> which also contained The Singles 1992–2003, The Videos 1992–2003 and Live in the Tragic Kingdom. Everything in Time was later released separately on October 12, 2004.|$|E
5|$|Rock Steady Live was {{released}} alongside The Singles 1992-2003, a greatest hits album, and <b>Boom</b> <b>Box,</b> a box set containing two CDs and two DVDs. No Doubt {{then went into}} hiatus, allowing singer Gwen Stefani to pursue solo projects. The DVD received mixed reviews, with critics praising the band's variety of musical styles. The DVD was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and platinum by the Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boom</b> <b>Box</b> is a limited-edition box set album by the American {{rock band}} No Doubt, {{released}} on November 25, 2003 through Interscope Records. It compiled The Singles 1992–2003, The Videos 1992–2003, Everything in Time, and Live in the Tragic Kingdom. The Singles 1992–2003 was also released {{on a separate}} CD on the same date. Everything in Time was released as a separate CD later on October 12, 2004. The Videos 1992–2003 was released as a separate DVD on May 4, 2004. At the time of Boom Boxs release, Live in the Tragic Kingdom had already been released on VHS and it was re-released on DVD on June 13, 2006.|$|E

5|$|The {{release of}} <b>Boom</b> <b>Box</b> {{received}} very little coverage from music critics {{because it was}} not a studio album. The few reviews it received were positive. The album charted at number 206 on the Top Internet Albums. However, in its separate release, The Singles 1992–2003 was reviewed widely and positively, and it charted highly across North America and Europe, peaking at number 2 in the US and number 5 in the UK. Everything in Time, in its separate release, charted on the US Billboard 200 at number 182.|$|E
5|$|Later, in April 2003, No Doubt {{went into}} hiatus {{to take a}} break to spend time with their {{families}} before starting to compile Everything in Time; The Singles 1992–2003, a greatest hits album featuring songs from their previous studio albums; and <b>Boom</b> <b>Box,</b> a box set compiling The Singles 1992–2003, Everything in Time, The Videos 1992–2003 and Live in the Tragic Kingdom, which would all be released on the same date. The main reason to go into hiatus was that, in early 2003, lead singer Gwen Stefani started work on her 1980s-inspired new wave/dance-pop music side project, under which she released two solo albums: Love. Angel. Music. Baby. on November 22, 2004 and The Sweet Escape on December 4, 2006.|$|E
25|$|Willimantic <b>Boom</b> <b>Box</b> Parade: Willimantic has {{received}} {{national and international}} attention for its annual <b>Boom</b> <b>Box</b> Parade. Back in 1986, with the local Windham High School marching Band having disbanded, local parade fan Kathleen Clark approached the local radio station WILI {{with the idea of}} a people’s parade. She offered her collection of vintage marching music records to the radio station with her idea that they play these patriotic marches throughout the duration of the parade. Parade goers were encouraged to bring their <b>Boom</b> <b>Box</b> radios and tune into 1400 AM. The parade was a hit, and its unique notion of having no live music has drawn the attention of CBS Evening News and the Washington Post, among others. The parade Grand Marshal is WILI radio host and local celebrity Wayne Norman. Parade participation is equally as important as parade attendance, with the vast majority of parade participants being individual citizens or local citizens groups who simply wish to share their creativity and national pride with spectators. Other cities from Madison, WI and Lubbock, TX, to Newfane, NY and Bullhead City, AZ, have had <b>Boom</b> <b>Box</b> Parades, but none have endured or been as large as Willimantic's.|$|E
50|$|Electronic Express {{was founded}} in 1983 inside a small 80 sq ft retail space within Harding Mall in Nashville, TN. The first store sold small {{electronics}} such as portable CD players, telephones, and <b>boom</b> <b>boxes</b> before expanding to a larger floor plan with more inventory.|$|R

25|$|Breaking, {{also called}} B-boying/B-girling or breakdancing, is a dynamic, rhythmic style of dance which {{developed}} {{as one of}} the major elements of hip hop culture. Like many aspects of hip hop culture, breakdance borrows heavily from many cultures, including 1930s-era street dancing, Brazilian and Asian Martial arts, Russian folk dance, and the dance moves of James Brown, Michael Jackson, and California funk. Breaking took form in the South Bronx in the 1970s alongside the other elements of hip hop. Breakdancing is typically done with the accompaniment of hip hop music playing on a <b>boom</b> <b>box</b> or PA system.|$|E
25|$|No Doubt {{released}} {{their fifth}} studio album, Rock Steady, in December 2001. The album sold three million copies and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In April 2003, No Doubt went into hiatus {{to take a}} break to spend time with their families before starting to compile Everything in Time; The Singles 1992–2003, a greatest hits album featuring songs from their previous studio albums; and <b>Boom</b> <b>Box,</b> a box set compiling The Singles 1992–2003, Everything in Time, The Videos 1992–2003 and Live in the Tragic Kingdom, which would all be released on the same date. The main reason to go into hiatus was that in early 2003, lead singer Gwen Stefani started work on her 1980s-inspired new wave/dance-pop music side project, under which she released two solo albums: Love.

5000|$|In the 2000s, {{there was}} a trend to focus on [...] "translation". Engineers tended to choose {{monitors}} less for their accuracy than {{for their ability to}} “translate” - to make recordings sound good on a variety of playback systems, from stock car radios and standard <b>boom</b> <b>boxes</b> to esoteric audiophile systems. As the mix engineer Chris Lord-Alge has noted: ...|$|R
5000|$|Consumer grade speakers, {{including}} {{car audio}} speakers, <b>boom</b> <b>boxes</b> and shelf stereo speakers. Engineers use these {{to hear how}} the finished mix will sound in regular listeners' speakers.

500|$|<b>Boom</b> <b>Box</b> spans mostly No Doubt's later musical style. The two {{greatest}} hits discs, The Singles 1992–2003 and The Videos 1992–2003, take 13 of their 15 or 16 tracks from Tragic Kingdom, Return of Saturn and Rock Steady. Their earlier musical style, {{in which the}} songs were written by keyboard player Eric Stefani, who left the band before Tragic Kingdom was recorded, is represented by only one song—"Trapped in a Box" [...] from No Doubt. The band's musical style changed later when Gwen Stefani started writing the songs; the tracks on Tragic Kingdom, which are heavily represented on <b>Boom</b> <b>Box,</b> are built on the themes of Gwen Stefani's femininity and the breakup of her relationship with fellow band member Tony Kanal. The B-sides and rare songs on Everything in Time were mainly recorded in the sessions for the band's fourth album, Return of Saturn, {{but two of the}} three remixes were of the song [...] "Rock Steady", from No Doubt's album, Rock Steady. <b>Boom</b> <b>Box</b> was given a [...] sticker in the United States because of the content in Live in the Tragic Kingdom, which also received the sticker upon its release.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} little coverage, {{not being a}} studio album, although the publications that did cover it gave average or good reviews, both in the box set <b>Boom</b> <b>Box</b> and its in solo release. It [...] charted on the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart at number 182.|$|E
500|$|Rock Steady Live was {{released}} on DVD on the Interscope Records label on November 23, 2003. On the same day, both The Singles 1992–2003 and <b>Boom</b> <b>Box</b> were also released by the band. The Singles 1992–2003 is a greatest hits album, featuring thirteen of No Doubt's previous singles, [...] "Trapped in a Box" [...] from their first album No Doubt and new single, [...] "It's My Life". <b>Boom</b> <b>Box</b> is a box set, containing Live in the Tragic Kingdom, a recording of a concert {{as part of the}} band's Tragic Kingdom Tour, The Singles 1992-2003, The Videos 1992-2003, compilation of the band's music videos, and Everything in Time, a collection of B-sides and rare songs. The DVD was directed by Sophie Muller, who also produced the band's previous video release, Live in the Tragic Kingdom.|$|E
40|$|Site-specific {{installation}} {{commissioned by}} Sound and Music for the Cut and Splice Festival 2010. Sound installation with 40 <b>boom</b> <b>boxes</b> and 2 flying radios. In the last 500 years, the standard 'A' to which musicians tune their instruments has varied widely from 403 Hz to 567 Hz before settling at the currently agreed 440 Hz. A precise 440 Hz sine tone {{has been recorded}} onto 40 cassette tapes: when these are played back on machines of varying quality and age, {{the result is a}} chorus of tones clustered around 440 Hz which interfere with each other to cause a pulsing phenomenon known as beat frequencies, the perception of which changes according to the position of the listener and the inconsistencies of tape speed.    The flying radios are inspired by the pigeons which no doubt inhabited Wilton’s Music Hall during its years of dereliction: one of the <b>boom</b> <b>boxes</b> is transmitting to the flying radios a set of Shepard Tones, the aural equivalent of an optical illusion which gives the impression of a tone which rises in pitch continuously, forever...|$|R
50|$|As {{electronics}} {{costs have}} decreased, {{it has become}} common to have sensor-equipped woofers in inexpensive 'music systems', <b>boom</b> <b>boxes,</b> or even car audio systems. This is usually done {{in an attempt to}} get better performance from inexpensive or undersized drivers in lightweight or poorly designed enclosures. This approach presents difficulties as not all distortion can be eliminated using servo techniques, and a poorly designed enclosure can swamp the benefits from any attempt at electronic correction.|$|R

She gathered feedback on what worked and what did not. Altogether, she made thirty-eight of these individualized tapes for clients {{over the course of the}} next two years.|$|R
500|$|In its 2003 release {{as part of}} <b>Boom</b> <b>Box,</b> Everything in Time was {{described}} as [...] "certainly worth having" [...] by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic in a review for the box set. RockMusicReview called the song [...] "Full Circle", from Everything in Time, {{one of the highlights}} of <b>Boom</b> <b>Box.</b> In its 2004 solo release, few critics reviewed Everything in Time because it was not a studio album. However, Laura Sinagra for Blender magazine gave it three stars out of five, saying it contained [...] "endearing, younger examples of the marriage-minded tomboy [...] agonizing over the task of taming restless playboys". She complimented [...] "New Friend", [...] "Under Construction" [...] and both versions of [...] "Everything in Time" [...] as [...] "satisfying laments" [...] with [...] "truth-serum lyrics", and praised Stefani's [...] "just-a-girl sass" [...] in [...] "Oi to the World". However, she criticized [...] "Big Distraction" [...] and [...] "Leftovers", which in her opinion were [...] "pale beside the singles [...] ". Both Allmusic and Artistdirect gave the album three stars out of five but neither gave an actual review.|$|E
500|$|After {{completion}} of Zaireeka, The Flaming Lips tried an unconventional method {{to tour the}} album. [...] "The <b>Boom</b> <b>Box</b> Experiments", like [...] "The Parking Lot Experiments", involved tapes being played at the same time. However, these shows were held in conventional rock venues, and the band supplied their own boom boxes. Coyne and Drozd conducted two [...] "choirs" [...] of people controlling the boom boxes, giving them instructions for actions like turning the volume up or down, while Ivins controlled the mixer.|$|E
500|$|An early 1997 {{performance}} at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim was filmed and was released as Live in the Tragic Kingdom on video cassette on November 11, 1997.

The accompanying music video for the song was filmed by director David LaChapelle at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Stefani insisted that just because no songwriting {{was involved in the}} production of the album did not mean no effort would be needed: the band had to decide which of their songs to include and which to leave out.

Their pocket size sparked a change in popular music listening habits, allowing people to listen to music anywhere they went. Beginning in the 1980s, however, cheap AM transistor radios were superseded by devices with higher audio quality such as portable CD players, personal audio players, <b>boom</b> <b>boxes,</b> and (eventually) smartphones, some of which contain radios themselves.|$|R
5000|$|Full Circle is {{the seventh}} studio album from the reggae band Morgan Heritage. The album {{features}} guest appearances from Sizzla, Damian Marley and LMS.
