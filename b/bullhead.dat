5|$|A close-quarters fight erupted, {{and within}} minutes several men were dead. The Lakota killed six policemen {{immediately}} {{and two more}} died shortly after the fight, including Lt. <b>Bullhead.</b> The police killed Sitting Bull and seven of his supporters at the site, along with two horses.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian Agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, {{feared that}} the Lakota leader was about to flee the {{reservation}} with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to arrest him. On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lt. Henry <b>Bullhead</b> (noted as Bull Head in lead), an Indian agency policeman, that included instructions and a plan to capture Sitting Bull. The plan called for the arrest to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised {{the use of a}} light spring wagon to facilitate removal before his followers could rally. <b>Bullhead</b> decided against using the wagon. He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the arrest.|$|E
5000|$|Brown <b>Bullheads</b> are {{omnivorous}} benthic bottom feeders. Their diet {{consists of}} algae, mollusks, crustaceans, insects, crayfish and other smaller fish species. [...] Brown <b>bullheads</b> are typically nocturnal feeders, {{but have been}} reported to feed diurnally. <b>Bullheads</b> have poor eye sight and are heavily reliant on their sensitive barbels to locate their food. [...] <b>Bullheads</b> are omnivorous and will reportedly eat almost anything that fits in their mouth.|$|R
5000|$|Brown <b>bullheads</b> hold {{no special}} status on the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, the United States Endangered Species Program, {{or under the}} CITES appendix. [...] Brown <b>bullheads</b> can {{tolerate}} very low dissolved oxygen levels that result from industrial and domestic pollution, aiding in their overall high rate of survivorship. [...] Brown <b>bullheads</b> are the most abundant species in many lakes and streams continentally.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{the recent}} years, some {{domestic}} overflow and blowout events {{have shown that}} we can not apply conven-tional methods to successful well killing under some certain conditions, therefore, <b>bullheading</b> as an unconventional well killing can be considered. <b>Bullheading</b> by pumping kill fluid into wellbore makes the wellbore gas compressed so that bot-tomhole pressure exceeds formation pressure and gas leaks off to the formation. In this study, applicable conditions of <b>bullheading</b> have been discussed. Based on gas compressibility law and gas-liquid flow behavoir, <b>bullheading</b> operation is divided into three stages, including gas compression stage, gas seepage stage and gas-liquid seepage stage. The mathe-matical model for each stage is formulated to predict and interpret well killing mechanism. The calculated results showed good agreement with field case data. This paper might serve as an operational guideline during <b>bullheading...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Fox River at Silver Springs has {{numerous}} {{species of}} freshwater fish including, bluegill, crappie, channel catfish, <b>bullhead,</b> carp, muskie and northern pike. The Loon and Beaver Lake fish population is maintained through human stocking. Channel catfish, bass, bluegill and crappie are stocked in both lakes.|$|E
5|$|Around 5:30a.m. on December 15, 39 police {{officers}} and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. They surrounded the house, knocked and entered. Lt. Bull Head told Sitting Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside. Sitting Bull and his wife noisily stalled for time, the camp awakened and men converged at the house. As Lt. <b>Bullhead</b> ordered Sitting Bull to mount a horse, he said the Indian Affairs agent needed to see the chief, and then he could return to his house. When Sitting Bull refused to comply, the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. Catch-the-Bear, a Lakota, shouldered his rifle and shot Lt. <b>Bullhead,</b> who reacted by firing his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull. Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and he dropped to the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m.|$|E
5000|$|Ictalurids {{originate}} from North America from southern Canada to Guatemala. Both <b>bullheads</b> and madtoms {{tend to be}} found in small streams and ponds, but are also known in larger bodies of water. Channel catfish, <b>bullheads,</b> and madtoms are [...] "bottom feeders" [...] with widely varied diets that include scavenging.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bullheads</b> live in {{a variety}} of habitats, {{including}} brackish and/or low oxygen ponds, rivers and lakes, although they are seldom stocked intentionally. They are bottom feeders and eat virtually anything edible, including dead fish, insects, other fish, grain, fruit, crayfish and more. Because of their limited use as for sport, they are usually caught while trying to catch other fish, and few anglers pursue them specifically. Persons looking to catch <b>bullheads</b> will use the same bait as they would for channel catfish, including cut bait, chicken livers, blood-soaked meal, or other pungent baits. In the Northeastern US <b>Bullheads</b> are often sold to restaurants in the spring for [...] "fish fries" [...] by amateur fisher folk by the 5 gallon bucket load. Like all catfish, <b>bullheads</b> have a sense of smell that is more developed than most canines.|$|R
50|$|Yellow <b>bullheads</b> are {{considered}} a minor game fish, and they are sought after for food. Yellow <b>bullheads</b> also can be introduced into streams with high pollution because of their high tolerance to pollution. They are not as sought after as other catfishes, but are still a game fish providing many a great fishing trip.|$|R
5|$|Cold water {{fishing is}} {{available}} in Black Moshannon Creek and several of its tributaries, where anglers will find rainbow and brown trout that have been stocked there for sport fishing by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Black Moshannon Lake's waters are warmer {{than those of the}} creek, and so hold many different species of fish, including largemouth bass, muskellunge, yellow perch, chain pickerel, <b>bullhead</b> catfish, northern pike, bluegill, and crappie.|$|E
5|$|The LCRV {{is one of}} {{the most}} densely {{populated}} areas along the river, and there are numerous towns including <b>Bullhead</b> City, Arizona, Needles, California, and Lake Havasu City, Arizona. Here, many diversions draw from the river, providing water for both local uses and distant regions including the Salt River Valley of Arizona and metropolitan Southern California. The last major U.S. diversion is at Imperial Dam, where over 90percent of the river's remaining flow is moved into the All-American Canal to irrigate California's Imperial Valley, the most productive winter agricultural region in the United States.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, {{approximately}} 12.7million {{people lived}} in the Colorado River basin. Phoenix in Arizona and Las Vegas in Nevada are the largest metropolitan areas in the watershed. Population densities are also high along the lower Colorado River below Davis Dam, which includes <b>Bullhead</b> City, Lake Havasu City, and Yuma. Other significant population centers in the basin include Tucson, Arizona; St. George, Utah; and Grand Junction, Colorado. Colorado River basin states are among the fastest-growing in the U.S.; the population of Nevada alone increased by about 66percent between 1990 and 2000 as Arizona grew by some 40percent.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, {{the only}} Class-A fishery {{waters in the}} Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} were those of Little Nescopeck Creek A, the headwaters of Nescopeck Creek, and several minor tributaries of Nescopeck Creek. Only one small stream near Nescopeck Creek's mouth had Class-C fishery waters. The central part of Nescopeck Creek, {{as well as most}} of Black Creek had Class-D fishery waters. There were twenty species of fish in Nescopeck Creek in 1999. Of these, seventeen had been seen in the watershed before. However, since between a 1999 study of the watershed and the study before that, the brown <b>bullhead</b> and the bluegill fish had vanished from the Nescopeck Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown <b>bullhead,</b> the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Las Vegas Strip {{shooting}} on the evening of October 1, 2017, approximately 300 people fleeing from the concert venue entered the airfield after breaking down the security fence surrounding McCarran while seeking shelter from the gunfire. Since they had entered an active airfield, airport officials suspended operations on 01L/19R and 01R/19L at 10:15p.m. local time, and then shut down 08L/26R and 08R/26L one hour later. Airfield operations resumed at 12:40a.m. on October 2, and the security fence was repaired by 1:10a.m. During the suspension of operations, 25 flights were diverted to other airports in the region, primarily to Phoenix but also to Los Angeles, Ontario, <b>Bullhead</b> City, Salt Lake City, and Denver. Two bullets struck and damaged, but did not ignite, a large fuel tank {{on the grounds of the}} airport.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} railway opened, {{complaints}} about vibrations from passing trains {{began to be}} made by occupiers of buildings along the route. The vibrations were caused by the heavy, largely unsprung locomotives which weighed 44tons (44.7tonnes). The Board of Trade set up a committee to investigate the problem, and the CLR experimented with two solutions. For the first solution, three locomotives were modified to use lighter motors and were provided with improved suspension, so the weight was reduced to 31tons (31.5tonnes), more of which was sprung to reduce vibrations; for the second solution, two six-carriage trains were formed that had the two end carriages converted and provided with driver's cabs and their own motors so they could run as multiple units without a separate locomotive. The lighter locomotives did reduce the vibrations felt at the surface, but the multiple units removed it almost completely and the CLR chose to adopt that solution. The committee's report, published in 1902, also found that the CLR's choice of 100lb/yard (49.60kg/m) bridge rail for its tracks rather than a stiffer <b>bullhead</b> rail on cross sleepers contributed to the vibration.|$|E

50|$|Black <b>bullheads</b> {{are found}} {{throughout}} the central United States, often in stagnant or slow-moving waters with soft bottoms. They {{have been known to}} congregate in confined spaces, such as lake outlets or under dams. They are very tolerant fish, and are able to live in muddy water, with warmer temperatures and in water with lower levels of oxygen, which reduce competition from other fish.Black <b>bullheads</b> also occur as an invasive species in large parts of Europe.|$|R
