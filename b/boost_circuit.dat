The proposed PLL can be locked to 672 MHz at 3. 3 V supply, which is- 1. 9 times the maximum frequency of the conventional PLL. The jitter measure-ment results are as follows. When the supply noise is not injected, the rms jitter is 8. 3 ps and the peak-to-peak jitter is 56 ps. When 0. 6 V peak-to-peak supply noise is superposed with Vdd, the rms jit-ter is 67 ps and the peak-to-peak jitter is 270 ps when the operating frequency is 592 MHz, the source follower enters the linear region.
