2500|$|According to Gavin White, the Greek {{constellation}} of Hercules is a distorted {{version of the}} Babylonian constellation known as the [...] "Standing Gods" [...] (MUL.DINGIR.GUB.BA.MESH). White argues that this figure was, like the similarly named [...] "Sitting Gods", depicted as {{a man with a}} serpent's body instead of legs (the serpent element now being represented on the Greek star map by the figure of Draco that Hercules crushes <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet).</b> He further argues that the original name of Hercules – the 'Kneeler' (see below) – is a conflation of the two Babylonian constellations of the Sitting and Standing Gods.|$|E
2500|$|Hitch carved the church's pulpit and {{completed}} the figural {{work for the}} reredos in the Parish church of Woodham in Surrey. The pulpit is {{on the north side}} of the Nave arch and is carved from oak. It was dedicated on Sunday 26 October 1913 by the Archdeacon of Surrey. The reredos was designed in early 14th Century Gothic style by the Reverend Ernest Geldart and was executed in 1915 in Corsham stone from Corsham quarries and was dedicated in 1915. At the time of dedication only the central panel was complete and the niches were unoccupied, but at rapid intervals the figures were completed and the reredos was dedicated by the vicar on Easter Eve 15 April 1922. [...] An aumbury and arcading on the north wall was added in 1918 and the work completed in 1921. Again Hitch did all the carving involved. The central panel of the reredos is surmounted by a canopy in carved stone and contains a representation of Our Lord as the everlasting Priest [...] "after the order of Melchizedek [...] " [...] surrounded by Cherubs and bearing the sacramental Cup and Bread of Life. He stands upon an altar, from whence, <b>beneath</b> <b>His</b> <b>feet,</b> there issue the Four Rivers of the Gospel. On either side, kneeling angels adore Him and offer incense, which the Prophet says should accompany the [...] "Pure Offering" [...] in every place. On the base of the pedestal are carved the words from the Te Deum- [...] "Tu Rex Gloria Christe" [...] (Thou art the king of Glory, O Christ). The statues inserted in the niches and the wall panels complete the theme of the reredos [...] "ALL THY SAINTS GIVE THANKS TO THEE" [...] for they represent saints of every age and all climes, including England. The evangelists are shown above the central niches, not in human form, but as the four living creatures revealed to St John in the Heavenly Vision:- the Angel of St Matthew, the Lion of St Mark, the Ox of St Luke, and the Eagle of St John. All bear scrolls inscribed with the first words of their gospels in Latin : - [...] "Liber generationis Jesu Christi"; [...] "Initium Evangelii Jesu Christi"; [...] "Fuit in diebus herodis"; [...] "In principio erat Verbum". [...] The names of the sixteen saints represented and from North to South are St Francis of Assisi, St Hilda-Abbess, St Helena- matron, St Edward the Confessor-King, St Swithun-Confessor, Venerable Bede-Confessor, St Paul-Apostle, St Peter- Apostle, St Stephen-Martyr, St George-Martyr, St Jerome-Doctor, St Augustine of Hippo-Doctor, St Columba-Missionary, St Faith- Virgin, St Etheldreda-Queen and Abbess and St Hugh of Lincoln-Abbot. Special interest attaches to the figure of St Swithun as he carries a small model of Winchester Cathedral. [...] St Swithun, the friend and educator of Alfred the Great was Bishop of Winchester A. D. 860, and in the “Bededictional of St Ethelworld” (a magnificently illuminated manuscript, formally one of the Treasures of the Chapter and now in the British Library), there is a drawing of the cathedral showing the columns and capitals, the roof with its red tiles and above it the golden weathercock. By kind permission of the dean a tracing was made of the copy given to the Chapter by the Duke of Westminster, the then owner and from this a drawing was made which Hitch followed for his sculpture. Hitch also carried out the carving on the front altar in the Lady Chapel. The central panel represents the moment of the presentation of the Holy Child in the Temple. Simeon is holding the child, while Mary is kneeling in an attitude of deep devotion and St Joseph is standing a little behind with his head inclined in prayer. On each side are panels with carved lilies with their leaves open. A photograph is shown here of Hitch’s carving of “Our Lord as the Everlasting Priest”, part of the reredos.|$|E

25|$|Nearly forty {{versions}} of the Madonna of the Yarnwinder made by pupils and followers of Leonardo survive today. Many show elements which were discarded as the prime version, or versions, evolved {{over a long period}} of time.

Some artists elaborated on Leonardo’s composition with the addition of still lives or extra figures.|$|R

6000|$|Korak glanced {{downward}} {{toward the}} speaker. Outlined against the faint luminosity {{of the water}} he saw {{the figure of a}} man clinging to a lower branch of the tree. Silently and swiftly the ape-man clambered downward. He felt a hand <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot.</b> He reached down and clutched the figure beneath him and dragged it up among the branches. It struggled weakly and struck at him; but Korak paid no more attention than Tantor to an ant. He lugged his burden to the higher safety and greater comfort of a broad crotch, and there he propped it in a sitting position against the bole of the tree. Numa still was roaring beneath them, doubtless in anger that he had been robbed of his prey. Korak shouted down at him, calling him, {{in the language of the}} great apes, [...] "Old green-eyed eater of carrion," [...] "Brother of Dango," [...] the hyena, and other choice appellations of jungle opprobrium.|$|R

5000|$|Andernach (...) {{is a town}} in the {{district}} of Mayen-Koblenz, in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, of currently about 30,000 inhabitants. It is situated {{towards the end of the}} Neuwied basin on the left bank of the Rhine between the former tiny fishing village of Fornich in the north and the mouth of the small river Nette in the southeast, just 13 mi north of Koblenz, with its five external town districts: Kell, Miesenheim, Eich, Namedy, and Bad Tönisstein. A few hundred metres downstream of Andernach the Rhine valley narrows from both sides forming the northern part of the romantic Middle Rhine stretch. Already in Roman times the place the narrow passage begins was named [...] "Porta Antunnacensis" [...] or Andernachian Gate. It is formed by two hills, the Krahnenberg (engl. Crane hill) and the Engwetter (Narrow weather) on the right bank near the wine village Leutesdorf (external town district of Bad Hönningen). The crane hill is named after the old crane <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> (see below); in earlier times (until 1650) the hill was named [...] "Geiersberg" [...] ("Vulture's hill").|$|R
60|$|He {{was very}} plainly, even poorly clad, and looked a dark figure even amongst these soberly appareled gentry.

5000|$|Expeditus' typical {{depiction}} in artwork is {{as a young}} Roman centurion.

Although in the English language a crow's cry is rendered as [...] "caw caw," [...] in Italian the sound is [...] "cra cra.", and Latin version was [...] "cras cras".|$|R
60|$|Korak lay {{where he}} could see the whole frightful tragedy. The cold sweat broke out upon his body. His heart seemed to have stopped its beating. Meriem might reach the trees before Tantor overtook her, but even her agility would not carry her beyond the reach of that {{relentless}} trunk--she would be dragged down and tossed. Korak could picture the whole frightful scene. Then Tantor would follow her up, goring the frail, little body with his relentless tusks, or trampling it into an unrecognizable mass <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> ponderous <b>feet.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Orissa, the {{iconography}} of Ekapada {{is quite different from}} that in South India. Though he has his characteristic one leg, matted hair and crescent moon headgear, and ascetic attendants, here Ekapada is never depicted with the torsos of Vishnu and Brahma. He may be four-armed or two-armed and is considered a form of Bhairava, the fearsome aspect of Shiva. He sports a short beard and moustache, an open mouth with fangs, and bulging eyes with a wrathful expression. He is ithyphallic (with an erect phallus) and wears a tiger skin around his waist. He wears various ornaments and a long yagnopavita (sacred thread) across his chest. In later images, Ekapada tends to be more terrifying, with a garland of skulls, serpentine ornaments and yagnopavita, and a corpse <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot.</b> Early images depict him with a varada mudra gesture and kamandalu; however, in later ones these are replaced by a damaru and a kapala. His other attributes may be an akshamala (rosary), a trishula, a serpent, a deer. His ascetic attendants may hold a trishula and sometimes he is accompanied by a female attendant and his vahana Nandi.|$|R
