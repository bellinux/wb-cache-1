By handling snakes, he saw himself as part of a continuing tradition that originated in a New Testament injunction. He upheld the ability to handle venomous snakes without harm as proof of salvation and evidence of steadfast faith, linking the practice to speaking in tongues. To him, snake handling was [...] a modern-day confirmation of God's power to supernaturally deliver people from harm. He often cast snakes as a representation of the Devil and interpreted the legal difficulties he encountered as religious persecution. He labeled those who rejected the observance of snake handling [...] "unbelievers".|$|E

40|$|The archival {{value of}} this paper is the {{investigation}} of novel methods to recover lead (II) ions from spent lead <b>acid</b> <b>battery</b> electrodes to be used directly as electrolyte for a soluble lead flow battery. The methods involved heating electrodes of spent lead <b>acid</b> <b>batteries</b> in methanesulfonic <b>acid</b> and hydrogen peroxide to dissolve solid lead and lead dioxide out of the electrode material. The processes yielded lead methanesulfonate, which is an electrolyte for the soluble lead <b>acid</b> <b>battery.</b> The lead (II) ions in the electrolyte were identified using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy and their electrochemistry confirmed using cyclic voltammetry. The concentration of lead (II) ions was determined and it was found that using the higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide yielded the highest concentration of lead (II) ions. The method was therefore found to be sufficient to make electrolyte for a soluble lead cel...|$|R
40|$|Poster Session: {{abstract}} no. 718 Due to its mature technological status, lead <b>acid</b> <b>batteries</b> {{have not}} been {{the focal point of}} batteries in the last decade. With the limitation on other new battery types – such as low power density for lithium ion battery, high self discharge and short life cycles for high current discharge for nickel metal hydride (Ni-MH) battery – researchers has revisited the possibilities to enhance lead <b>acid</b> <b>battery</b> technology. Lead <b>acid</b> <b>batteries</b> are durable with low maintenance, inexpensive and simple to manufacture; recyclable and lowest self discharge among other rechargeable systems. With the above advantages, lead <b>acid</b> <b>batteries</b> are both cost effective and energy efficient; it is expected that lead <b>acid</b> <b>battery</b> would attract interests from battery manufacturers should the lower energy density and cycle life be improved. Here, we report the use of a hybrid system composed of lead acid and nickel metal hydride batteries, with the positive PbO 2 electrode and negative MH electrode suspended in H 2 SO 4 and KOH gel electrolyte. The lead acid and NiMH sections are separated by the anion exchange membrane and cation exchange membrane respectively, with a neutral K 2 SO 4 solution (in the centre) sandwiched between the two membranes. It is anticipated that the construct of this hybrid cell would compromise the respective limitations of the individual lead <b>acid</b> or Ni-MH <b>batteries.</b> The hybrid system in gel electrolyte is able to maintain its capacity longer than that of the aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, the hybrid system in gel electrolyte also solves the safety issues concerning the transportation restrictions on flooded lead <b>acid</b> <b>battery</b> …link_to_OA_fulltextThe 220 th ECS Meeting and the 1 st Electrochemical Energy Summit, Boston, MA, 9 - 14 October 2011.

Federal statute 40CFR§261 regulates these wastes. Ignitable wastes are defined by their combustion capacity under conditions when they consist of waste oils and solvents. Corrosive wastes like <b>battery</b> <b>acids</b> are characterized by their pH value - acids (pH ≤ 2) and bases (pH ≥ 12.5). Reactive wastes include lithium-sulfur batteries and explosives that can cause explosions, toxic fumes, or gases and toxic wastes that are harmful to human health or environment when inhaled or ingested or disposed. Examples of toxic wastes include mercury and lead.|$|R
