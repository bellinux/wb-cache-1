500|$|When Tankersley was four, {{her father}} died by suicide, {{believed}} to be partly attributed to his defeat for renomination in 1924. [...] Her mother remarried in 1932 to Albert Gallatin Simms, a congressman from New Mexico, lawyer, and banker. Tankersley spent part of her childhood on her mother's Rock River dairy farm in Byron, Illinois, and later moved to the Southwest {{with her mother and}} stepfather, living at a ranch owned by Simms in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at first, and then moving in 1937 to the Trinchera Ranch, a [...] property in Colorado that her mother had purchased. Tankersley attended a boarding school in Virginia and spent summers in the West. Her love of horses in general and the Arabian horse in particular came from those years: [...] "Right away, my stepfather <b>bought</b> <b>me</b> a cow pony, and I wore it out... So my mother got me a [...] Arabian that I couldn't wear out." [...] She also showed horses on the East Coast in the 1930s. Her interest in Arabian horses led her to meet several major breeders of the time, including Jimmie Dean of Traveler's Rest, Roger Selby, W.R. Brown and Carl Raswan.|$|E
500|$|According to David Prior, {{producer}} of the subsequent two-disc special edition, the initial bare bones edition [...] "was only reluctantly agreed to by Fincher because I needed {{more time on the}} bonus material. The studio was locked into their release date, so Fincher allowed that version to be released first. It {{had nothing to do with}} Fincher 'double dipping his own movie before it even makes it to stores' and everything to do with buying more time for the special edition". He stated that the theatrical cut would only be available on the single-disc edition. Prior elaborated further: [...] "Nobody wants fans feeling like they're being taken advantage of, and I know that double-dipping creates that impression. That's why it was so important to me that consumers be told there was another version coming. In this case it really was a rock-and-a-hard-place situation, and delaying the second release was done strictly for the benefit of the final product... But this is a very ambitious project, easily the most far-reaching I've ever worked on, and owing largely to studio snafus that I can't really elaborate on, I didn't have enough time to do it properly. Thus Fincher <b>bought</b> <b>me</b> the extra time by agreeing to a staggered release, which I'm very grateful for". [...] In its first week, rentals for the DVD earned $6.7 million.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the fame}} of Lisa Simpson, Smith is rarely {{recognized}} in public, {{as it is}} Lisa who appears on screen. However, Smith does not mind. She said, [...] "it's wonderful {{to be in the}} midst of all this hype about the show, and people enjoying the show so much, and to be totally a fly on the wall; people never recognise me solely from my voice." [...] In a 2009 interview with The Guardian she commented that [...] "It's the best job ever. I have nothing but gratitude for the amount of freedom The Simpsons has <b>bought</b> <b>me</b> in my life." [...] Although Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992, she considers it unimportant, saying [...] "there's part of me that feels it wasn't even a real Emmy." [...] The award is a Creative Arts prize not awarded during the primetime telecast and, at the time, a juried award without nominations. Still, Smith considers her work on the show a success. [...] "If I had to be associated with one character in fiction," [...] she said, [...] "I will always be thrilled that it was Lisa Simpson." [...] Matt Groening has described Smith as being very similar to Lisa: [...] "Yeardley has strong moral views about her character. There are lines that are written for Lisa that Yeardley reads and says, 'No, I wouldn't say that.'" [...] Former Simpsons writer Jay Kogen praised her performance on the show, particularly in the episode [...] "Lisa's Substitute", as able [...] "to move past comedy to something really strong and serious and dramatic." ...|$|E

About her dad, Brandy states: “I grew up singing in church with my dad, {{where he was the}} musical director and we sang gospel songs in acapella almost exclusively. He <b>bought</b> <b>me</b> my first 4-track tape recorder. At first, I didn’t like my own voice, but he encouraged me to embrace the unique qualities of my voice.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In early 1978, {{staff at}} a {{facility}} for problem pupils, to which Spencer had been referred for truancy, informed her parents {{that she was}} suicidal. That summer, Spencer, who was known to hunt birds in the neighborhood, was arrested for shooting out the windows of Cleveland Elementary with a BB gun, and burglary. In December, a psychiatric evaluation arranged by her probation officer recommended Spencer be admitted to a mental hospital for depression, but her father refused to give permission. For Christmas 1978, {{he gave her a}} Ruger 10/22 semi-automatic [...]22 caliber rifle with a telescopic sight and 500 rounds of ammunition. Spencer later said, [...] "I asked for a radio and he <b>bought</b> <b>me</b> a gun." [...] When asked why he might have done that, she answered, [...] "I felt like he wanted me to kill myself." ...|$|E

After order was restored, a furious Chisora stated multiple times that he would [...] "shoot" [...] David Haye and claimed Haye [...] "glassed" [...] him. Haye's former manager Adam Booth emerged from the fracas with a facial wound and Chisora suggested to Booth that Haye hit him with a bottle by mistake while Booth insisted it was one of Chisora's entourage that had hit him with a bottle [...] During an interview at the Chisora vs. Haye press conference Booth was asked [...] "how did you end up with a cut on your head?"

As Ol' Dirty Bastard took the stage to a round of applause, he asked the audience, [...] "Please calm down, the music and everything.

2500|$|At age 11, Parker {{took up the}} drums, {{just like}} his brother, and later was making [...] "excessively melodic music from {{about the age of}} 12 to 15", which was [...] "really weird and {{repetitive}} and almost genre-less", by recording his drumming and overdubbing guitar and other instruments in lo-fi experiments. Speaking about this Parker said [...] "I've always recorded music. When I was 12, I used to set up two tape machines and multi-track myself. First, I'd record a beat on the drums, then, I'd play that tape into another tape recorder while playing keyboard; then I'd take that tape and play bass guitar along with the drums and keyboard. I'd keep adding instruments. I did {{that for a long time}} until my dad <b>bought</b> <b>me</b> an 8-track, and then I continued recording music by myself, even if I was in other bands at the same time." [...] This hobby turned into an obsession for Parker who was [...] "just doing music all the time, I never did any homework, I'd just spend every night in the garage recording music." [...] Parker got his first eight-track recorder at age 16.|$|E
