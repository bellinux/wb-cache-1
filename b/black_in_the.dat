5|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of Landis's commissionership is the question of race. From 1884, black ballplayers were informally banned from organized baseball. No black ballplayer played in organized baseball during Landis's commissionership; Rickey (then running the Brooklyn Dodgers) broke the color line by signing Jackie Robinson to play for the minor league Montreal Royals in 1946, after Landis's death; Robinson became the first <b>black</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> major leagues since the 19th century, playing with the Dodgers beginning in 1947.|$|E

5|$|After Bernard Blake intercepted an AJ McCarron pass on Alabama's first {{possession}} of the second half, Jared Roberts kicked a 45-yard field goal on the drive that ensured that made the score 17–3. Roberts then scored the Rams' only other points on their next possession with his 31-yard field goal. Early in the fourth quarter, Trey DePriest both forced and recovered a Garrett Grayson fumble. On the next play, Alabama scored on a 30-yard McCarron touchdown pass to DeAndrew White for a 24–6 lead. The Crimson Tide then made the final score 31–6 with a 15-yard Blake Sims touchdown pass to Chris <b>Black.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> game, the Rams were led by former Crimson Tide offensive coordinator Jim McElwain and received $1.5 million {{to play the game}} at Bryant–Denny Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Defeated Sanity {{was formed}} in Dachsbach, Germany in 1994 by guitarist Wolfgang Teske and drummer Lille Gruber, {{initially}} as a side project. In 1996, bassist Jonas Gruber and vocalist Robert Colnik joined the band as session musicians. This line-up recorded the first two demos, Devoured by the <b>Black</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same year, followed by Withdrawn from Beauty in 1998. After undergoing a line-up change, Defeated Sanity eventually recruited guitarist Christian Müenzner and bassist Tino Köhler. Colnik departed the band shortly after recording a demo in 2000. He was replaced by Markus Keller, who re-recorded a track from the demo; the track was included on the split with Poppy Seed Grinder, released through the Czech label Grodhaisn in 2001. Later that year, Münzner left the band to join Necrophagist. Defeated Sanity released a 7-inch split EP with Brazilian death metal band Imperious Malevolence through Merciless Records in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{developmental}} biology ('Evo Devo') has assembled evidence from embryology and genetics {{to show how}} evolution has acted at all scales from the whole organism down to individual genes, proteins and genetic switches. In the case of countershaded mammals with dark (often brownish) upper parts and lighter (often buff or whitish) under parts, {{such as in the}} house mouse, it is the Agouti gene which creates the difference in shading. Agouti encodes for a protein, the Agouti signalling peptide (ASP), which specifically inhibits the action of the Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). In the absence of the Agouti protein, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone stimulates the cells bearing MC1R, melanocytes, to produce dark eumelanin, colouring the skin and fur dark brown or <b>black.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> presence of the Agouti protein, the same system produces the lighter-coloured, yellow or red phaeomelanin. A genetic switch active in the cells of the embryo that will become the belly skin causes the Agouti gene to become active there, creating the countershading seen in adult mammals.|$|E

5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{undergoes a}} molt {{in the spring}} and autumn. It is the only cardueline finch to undergo a molt twice a year. During the winter molt it sheds all its feathers; in the spring, it sheds all but the wing and tail feathers, which are dark brown in the female and <b>black</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> male. The markings on these feathers remain through each molt, with bars on the wings and white under and {{at the edges of the}} short, notched tail. The sexual dimorphism displayed in plumage coloration is especially pronounced after the spring molt, when the bright color of the male's summer plumage is needed to attract a mate.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{blackcap}} (Sylvia atricapilla) usually known {{simply as}} the blackcap, is a common and widespread typical warbler. It has mainly olive-grey upperparts and pale grey underparts, and differences between the five subspecies are small. Both sexes have a neat coloured cap to the head, <b>black</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> male and reddish-brown in the female. The male's typical song is a rich musical warbling, often ending in a loud high-pitched crescendo, but a simpler song is given in some isolated areas, such as valleys in the Alps. The blackcap's closest relative is the garden warbler, which looks quite different but has a similar song.|$|E
5|$|The bill is <b>black</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{nominate}} subspecies but pale or yellowish {{in adults}} {{of the smaller}} Indian ginginianus. Rasmussen and Anderton (2005) suggest that this variation may need further study, particularly due to the intermediate black-tipped bill described in rubripersonatus. The facial skin is yellow and unfeathered down to the throat. The sexes are indistinguishable in plumage but breeding males have a deeper orange facial skin colour than females. Females average slightly larger and are about 10–15% heavier than males. Young birds are blackish or chocolate brown with black and white patches. The adult plumage is attained only after about five years.|$|E

5|$|The {{first use}} of the opening against a {{world-class}} player was at Berlin in April 1918, a double round-robin tournament with four players: Akiba Rubinstein, Carl Schlechter, Jacques Mieses and Milan Vidmar. Vidmar had to play <b>Black</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first round against Rubinstein, then ranked the fourth {{best player in the}} world with a very positional style. At a loss for what to play, he sought advice from his friend Abonyi, who showed him the Budapest Gambit and the main ideas the Hungarian players had found. Vidmar followed Abonyi's advice and beat Rubinstein convincingly in just 24 moves. This victory so heartened Vidmar that he {{went on to win the}} tournament, while Rubinstein was so demoralised by this defeat that he lost another game against Mieses and drew a third one against Schlechter in the same opening.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} of state inheritance taxes on two estates also plagued <b>Black.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first case, Governor Stanley {{had made a}} compromise {{settlement of}} back taxes with L. V. Harkness before his death. The compromise was criticized, and although Black asked {{the attorney general to}} investigate, the case was not decided during Black's tenure as governor. In the second case, Stanley had appointed three special attorneys to collect inheritance taxes from the estate of Mrs. Robert Worth Bingham. Black wanted the attorneys to resign and save the state their large fees, but refused to remove them outright. This action was made more damning because one of the attorneys was a member of Black's campaign staff.|$|E
5|$|The winter fur is dense, {{but short}} and closely fitting. In {{northern}} subspecies, the fur {{is soft and}} silky, but coarse in southern forms. The summer fur is very short, sparser and rougher. The upper parts in the summer fur are dark, but vary geographically from dark-tawny or dark-chocolate to light pale tawny or sandy. The lower parts, including the lower jaw and inner sides of the legs, are white. There is often a brown spot {{at the corner of}} the mouth. The dividing line between the dark upper and light lower parts is usually straight but sometimes forms an irregular line. The tail is brown, and sometimes the tip is a little darker but it is never <b>black.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> northern part of its range and at high altitudes, the least weasel changes colour in the winter, the coat becoming pure white and exhibiting a few black hairs in rare circumstances.|$|E
