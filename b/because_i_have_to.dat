When the battle commenced he insisted on making the charge with the rest, but collapsed within a short distance. His last words, according to Herodotus, were, [...] "I grieve not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> die for my country, but because I have not lifted my arm against the enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|Ghosts of Onyx author Eric Nylund had {{previously}} written {{two of the}} three past Halo novels, [...] and , and went to Halos developer Bungie with an outline of {{what he wanted to do}} next. According to Nylund, Bungie gave him room to write the story as long as he accomplished some [...] "very specific [...] goals", sometimes making changes to the Halo universe to incorporate his ideas. However, he acknowledged the difficulty of fitting his story into the rest of the Halo universe was far greater for Ghosts of Onyx than the other novels as more of the story had been made public and was no longer able to be modified. Nylund mentioned in an interview with IGN that writing a Halo novel had both its positive aspects and drawbacks. [...] "It's better because I have all these great toys and characters to play with," [...] Nylund stated in an interview, [...] "It's not so good <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> work and play well with other parts of the intellectual property so everything meshes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Appearing on the Song Exploder podcast in 2016, Cuomo {{explained}} the process {{he used to}} write albums such as Weezer's White Album (2016). He maintains Spotify playlists of music with [...] "cool" [...] chord progressions that he uses to find musical inspiration. He sometimes uses piano to write vocal melodies his vocal muscles would be [...] "too lazy" [...] to create. Conversely, he improvises vocal melodies to write guitar solos, to avoid guitar habits and create solos [...] "you can sing along to" [...] with [...] "space in [...] <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> breathe".|$|E

Somebody like me? I run a business and I need to take bloody fucking trustee's permission to take my profit". Fayed was appointed honorary chairman of Harrods, a position he was scheduled to hold for at least six months.|$|E

5000|$|Hyoseong {{managed to}} make it to the final 12, out of which only 3 were girls. She expressed, [...] "I changed a lot during 'Battle Shinhwa.' I could never let myself relax.

It's what he does that's wrong and makes me so unhappy. And then he 's always threatenin' to cut my throat if I leave him. It's all the drink, and things preying on his mind; he 's not a bad man really. Sometimes he'll speak quite kind to me, but I've stood so much from him, I don't feel it in me to speak kind back, but just keep myself to myself. And he's all right with the children too, except when he's not himself.|$|E
