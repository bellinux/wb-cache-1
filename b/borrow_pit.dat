40|$|M. Sc. This study {{focuses on}} the {{rehabilitation}} of <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> on linear pipeline projects. In the past {{there have been many}} attempts to rehabilitate <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> to an ecological acceptable manner. Recently legislation has become more stringent regarding mine closure and rehabilitation. With the introduction of the new Mineral and Petroleum Development Act (MPRDA 28 of 2002), there has been an increase of awareness towards the immediate environment. As this project was a challenge in itself, there were no clear and concise methods in the Act that provide guidelines for final rehabilitation. Normally <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> as used on road concessions for material sourcing is left as different landforms like before excavation. The main {{reason for this is that}} materials are removed from the pits and not replaced, resulting in areas that are usually lower than their original ground levels. Some unwanted screened material will return to these <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> but will not complement what the original level should be. These <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> are usually clearly visible as low lying areas filled with water alongside roads. The Vaal River Eastern Subsection Augmentation Project (VRESAP) pipeline <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> were unique in the sense that not only material from screening activities were replaced, but also material excavated from the trench were replaced into the <b>borrow</b> <b>pits.</b> What makes this study unique is the fact that an opportunity was presented and clearly stipulated by the standard environmental management plan (SEMP) that <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> had to be filled back to their original ground levels or an acceptable level agreed on by the landowner. With this unique project, unique problems arose causing excess material amounting to 327 700 m³, available from the pipeline cavity. External spoil areas had to be promulgated and managed as part of site. This study through its various elements addresses some of the main problems encountered on VRESAP by looking at soil analysis, monitoring regimes, pre and post land use and other mechanisms from literature studies used on similar projects in the mining industry. vii The study also provides recommendations to the reader for future pipeline developments as well as conclusions made by the author. The recommendations made, include ways of rehabilitation planning through trials and errors made on site. Various conclusions were made that would substantiate this study in perspective to user-friendly and practical approaches...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> caused by sand mining {{at the bottom}} of the coastal sea in Japan. <b>Borrow</b> <b>pits</b> have been {{identified}} as a source of oxygen-deficient water with hydrogen sulfide. It has become increasingly important to restore <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> to improve the marine environment. However, large quantities of sand materials are needed to restore <b>borrow</b> <b>pits.</b> Recently, dredged materials generated by sea route maintenance have been adopted instead of sand materials. However, one problem of dredged materials is that they can be weak ground materials. Therefore, slag-mixed material made from the dredged material and steelmaking slag has been proposed. In this study, control of hydrogen sulfide release resulting from changing the hardness of the slag-mixed materials has been examined. Hydrogen sulfide release strongly depends on the hardness of the slag-mixed material. Microbial analysis indicated fewer living bacteria and the relative abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the slag-mixed material compared with the dredged material. The solidification of the dredged material using steelmaking slag decreased not only hydrogen sulfide release but also dissolved iron and manganese release. It is considered that controlling the hardness of the dredged material mixed with steelmaking slag provides an effective means of sulfide release control...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study employs an {{existing}} finite-difference model {{based on the}} hyperbolic form of the Modified Mild Slope Equation (MMSE) to investigate wave reflection near bathymetric depressions such as dredged <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> and nearshore canyons. First, the model is tested for numerical limitations on the higher order bottom slope and curvature terms using a idealized cases of a simple depth transition and a symmetric trapezoidal trench, with comparisons of the MMSE to both the traditional Mild Slope Equation (MSE) solution and a shallow water analytic solution. It is demonstrated that the model gives accurate solutions on slopes as steep as 1 : 1, and that the solutions from all three models agree in the shallow water region. However, for waves in intermediate depths, predicted wave reflection from nearshore depressions is shown to differ significantly between the MMSE and MSE models. Next, geometrical data {{from a wide range}} of existing and proposed <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> and a submarine canyon are gathered and analyzed for whether wave reflection is an important process near realistic nearshore depressions. The geometric data show that realistic nearshore depressions lie within the tested range of the MMSE model and that <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> are generally not in shallow water, which means it is important to use an MMSE-type model to calculate reflection from these features. In addition, storm conditions on average lead to a 50 % increase in reflection coefficient in comparison to the mean wave conditions, du...|$|R
