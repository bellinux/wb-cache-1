5000|$|Vehicles are {{increasingly}} computerized, with engine timing, cruise control, anti-lock <b>brakes,</b> <b>seat</b> belt tensioners, door locks, airbags and advanced driver-assistance systems on many models. Additionally, connected cars may use Wif-Fi and bluetooth {{to communicate with}} onboard consumer devices and the cell phone network. Self-driving cars {{are expected to be}} even more complex.|$|R
500|$|A {{number of}} {{innovations}} were either invented or improved sufficiently {{to allow for}} mass production during the decade: air conditioning, automatic transmission, power steering, power <b>brakes,</b> <b>seat</b> belts and arguably the most influential change in automotive history, the overhead-valve V8 engine. [...] The horsepower race had begun, laying {{the foundation for the}} muscle car era.|$|R
50|$|The Bolt {{will cost}} between £180,000 and £500,000, {{depending}} on the features, customers can select from several engine sizes, as well as choosing the dashboard instruments, <b>brakes,</b> mirrors, <b>seats</b> and bodywork.|$|R
500|$|As the war winds down, Tucker has a {{dream of}} finally {{building}} the [...] "car of the future." [...] The [...] "Tucker Torpedo" [...] will feature revolutionary safety designs including disc <b>brakes,</b> <b>seat</b> belts, a pop out windshield, and head lights which swivel when you turn. [...] Tucker hires young designer Alex Tremulis {{to help with the}} design and enlists New York financier Abe Karatz to arrange financial support. Raising the money through a stock issue, Tucker and Karatz acquire the enormous Dodge Chicago Plant to begin manufacturing. [...] Abe hires Robert Bennington to run the new Tucker Corporation on a day-to-day basis.|$|R
25|$|In July 1995, the facelifted {{model was}} {{launched}} in Australia, although this differed to the update applied to the North American variants. The update brought a new grille, slight updates to the rear end, new hubcaps, a lighter interior colour scheme with a new range of fabrics, and the discontinuation of the Ultima trim. Equipment wise, a new security system was fitted with remote central locking, engine immobiliser and alarm. The CSi gained four-wheel disc brakes, and optional anti-lock <b>brakes.</b> <b>Seat</b> belt webbing clamps for the front seats were now fitted as was a lap-sash belt in the centre rear. Climate control air-conditioning for the CS-X, an improved stereo system, {{and the addition of}} cup holders also featured.|$|R
5000|$|In mid-1996, {{front drum}} brakes and fixed front seat belts were re-launched {{in a new}} budget version called the [...] "Volkswagen Sedán City", which was sold {{alongside}} the upscale version [...] "Volkswagen Sedán Clásico" [...] which had front disc <b>brakes,</b> automatic <b>seat</b> belts, right side mirror, velour upholstery, optional metallic colors and wheel covers in matte finish (also found on some 1980s Beetles and Buses). These two versions were sold until mid 1998. From mid 1998-2003, The Sedán Clásico was discontinued and the Sedán City lost its prefix and gained disc <b>brakes,</b> automatic <b>seat</b> belts and optional metallic colors. This last version was named the [...] "Volkswagen Sedán Unificado" [...] or simply the [...] "Volkswagen Sedán".|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} safety kit includes driver, passenger, {{and side}} airbags, plus ABS <b>brakes</b> and <b>seat</b> belts that reduce chest injuries. The Cougar is well protected against theft and break in, {{due to an}} engine immobilizer, remote control central and double locking systems, and an alarm.|$|R
50|$|After {{clearing}} the <b>brakes,</b> the <b>seats</b> pick up speed, reaching 12 mph. The riders are held 229 {{feet in the}} air for several seconds, after which the ride vehicle is released from the couplings. This causes it to free fall nearly 150 feet at 65 mph.|$|R
5000|$|The Legend offered many Honda [...] "firsts", such as {{a driver}} side airbag, vehicle speed {{sensitive}} power assist rack and pinon steering, anti-lock <b>brakes,</b> <b>seat</b> belt pre-tensioners with Emergency Locking Retractors (called E.L.R.), a choice of 100% wool or cloth moquette upholstery, and [...] "TCS" [...] Traction control, the first car to use traction control on a front wheel drive vehicle. Attention was given {{to make sure the}} Legend was quiet, so Honda used computer simulation using NASTRAN, a stress analysis program created by NASA, helping the car achieve a drag coefficient of 0.32 and an interior noise level of 63 dB (measured while the vehicle was travelling at 100 km/h using a manual transmission in 5th gear), and by using triple seals around the tops of door openings.|$|R
5000|$|Standard: [...] (6,850,000+tax). It adds racing wheel package (Mugen RC 18-inch {{wheel with}} Yokohama tire), brake package (front+rear <b>brake</b> pads), <b>seat</b> and {{steering}} (Recaro bucket seat, seat rail, steering wheel with box, TAKATA harness), carbon inner part option A (carbon fibre right floor cover panel, footrest, door lining) over BASIC.|$|R
50|$|In March 2011, models 39625, 3962, and 2206 {{received}} upgrades, {{consisting of}} ABS <b>brakes,</b> power steering, <b>seat</b> belts and the Euro-4 engine as standard equipment.|$|R
5000|$|The Cascada shares {{much of its}} {{interior}} design with the Opel Astra J on which it is based. Specifications vary between brands however standard features shared between brands include electric park <b>brake,</b> sport <b>seats,</b> DAB Radio, auto headlights and wipers, cruise control, electric folding roof and 7.0" [...] Intellelink Infotainment System branded as MyLink for the Holden.|$|R
50|$|Each {{unit was}} formed of a Driving Motor <b>Brake</b> Third (<b>seating</b> 52); a Trailer Composite (seating 24 first class and 38 third class passengers); and a Driving Trailer Third (seating 60). Third class was redesignated Second {{across the whole}} of BR on 3 June 1956, while the first class seating of these units was declassified to second in early 1960.|$|R
50|$|Besides its {{streamlined}} appearance, the Monza GT had innovative features, including magnesium-alloy wheels, 4-wheel disc <b>brakes,</b> {{and fixed}} <b>seats</b> with adjustable pedals. These features would eventually {{turn up in}} production cars, years later.|$|R
5000|$|A feature {{retained}} {{from the}} Mark III was [...] "Sure-track" [...] brakes, making the Mark IV {{one of the}} first American cars to become equipped with anti-lock <b>brakes.</b> Both front <b>seats</b> were power adjustable.|$|R
2500|$|... 4-door {{sedan and}} station wagon Rebels from CKD (Completely Knocked Down) kits were {{assembled}} by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) in Port Melbourne, Victoria. Australian models {{were made with}} a RHD version of the 1967 Rambler Ambassador dash and two-dial instrument pack rather than the North American dash and rectangular speedo. The dash and cluster were reused for all subsequent models, including the Matador. The cars were built with right-hand drive and the body had the engine, transmission, front suspension, rear axle, and doors installed in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Other parts were boxed and shipped inside the car for final assembly in Australia. Australian models had to have aftermarket amber rear indicator lights fitted in the boot (trunk) lid to 1969 and amber lenses fitted behind the clear reverse lenses on 1970 models, as flashing red indicators were barred in Australia. Also in Australia, numerous other parts and components such as <b>brakes,</b> <b>seats,</b> carpet, lights, heaters, etc. were sourced locally to gain tariff concessions. As AMI also assembled Toyota vehicles, some parts used on the AMI Rebels were sourced from Toyota.|$|R
50|$|The Legend {{offered a}} host of {{features}} seen on luxury cars of today including dual front driver & passenger airbags (standard on 1991 Legend LS, 1992 L and LS trims), speed-sensitive steering, hands-free telephone, automatic climate control, heated leather seats, heated mirrors, four-wheel ABS disc <b>brakes,</b> <b>seat</b> belt pretensioners, and soft-close vacuum-operated doors (coupes only). The rear end appearance of the sedan was adopted from the first generation Legend coupe, as the first generation sedans appearance was {{very similar to the}} first generation Subaru Legacy, and Honda also wanted to visually align the appearance of both the Legend coupe and sedan to the Acura NSX. The segment the Legend originally filled was now being served by the Acura Vigor which allowed the Legend to position itself more towards the rear drive Lexus LS and the Infiniti Q45 sedans. Honda decided not to upgrade the size of the engine to a V8 because it would have upstaged the Acura NSX which has a V6 that introduced Honda's VTEC technology.|$|R

50|$|The pair {{of large}} tires are {{suspended}} {{on a single}} trailing arm; maximum towing speed is 60 km/h on the road. As was normal in Soviet designs, the tyres were filled with foam. Initially, the D-30 had no <b>brakes</b> and no <b>seat</b> for the layer—non-essential luxuries.|$|R
50|$|Improvements {{included}} a better <b>brake</b> (singular), lower <b>seating</b> position, improved girder forks and a rectangular fuel tank, which replaced the previous cylindrical tank. It {{was in this}} year that Carl Stearns Clancy of New York returned from circling the globe on a 1912 Henderson, armed with many photographs to prove it.|$|R

50|$|The {{bucket seat}} {{arrangement}} leaves a {{space between the}} two front seats, usually occupied by a shifter and hand <b>brake.</b> Originally, bucket <b>seats</b> were associated with imported cars in the 1950s and 1960s. The Volkswagen Bus was originally available with three rows of bench seats seating up to nine passengers, but since then most minivans have been configured to seat seven or eight with front bucket seats.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} other two rebadged models, Up is the first car in its class to offer an {{automated}} braking system, called City Emergency Braking. The system is automatically activated at speeds below 30 km/h, when a laser sensor identifies a danger of collision and activates the <b>brakes.</b> In the <b>SEAT</b> model, the system is called City Safety Assist and in the Škoda model it is called City Safe Drive.|$|R
50|$|Thirty open {{wagons and}} a 4-wheeled brake van were {{initially}} provided, each wagon carrying about 16 long cwt kg of coal or 22 long cwt kg of bricks. The wagon 'tops' were removable {{to allow them}} to be used as flats, and bolster fittings were supplied to carry long items such as timber. An open 16 seat bogie coach, a bogie parcel van (for 'game') and a small open 4 wheeled brake 'van' were also provided at the opening. Finally, a closed bogie passenger vehicle, some 20 ft long seating 12 people inside and four outside, a bogie <b>brake</b> van <b>seating</b> four inside and four outside were supplied after opening. Other wagons were constructed by the Eaton Estate and rebuilt over the years.|$|R
5000|$|The 1964 model {{appeared}} {{very similar}} to the 1963. Curb weight was down, but overall length was up to 215.3 in. Sales dropped further, to 13,753 coupes (down 36%) and 2,410 convertibles (down 45%). The Starfire now shared its basic bodyshell with the new and lower-priced Jetstar I hardtop coupe which competed directly against the Pontiac Grand Prix. The Jetstar also used the Starfire's [...] 394 cid L [...] "Ultra High Compression" [...] Rocket V8, but had a pricetag that was over $500 lower than the Starfire due to the use of a vinyl bucket seat interior and the fact that many Starfire standard features were optional on the Jetstar including Hydra-Matic transmission, power steering and <b>brakes.</b> Front <b>seat</b> belts were now standard.|$|R
40|$|EFFECTS OF NORMOXIC NITROUS OXIDE AND HYPERTHERMIA ON PERFORMANCE DURING A WINGATE TEST A. Yogev, A. Hall, O. Jay and M. D. White. Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada It was {{hypothesized}} that normoxic 30 % nitrous oxide gas and passively-induced hyperthermia would increase performance during short duration, high intensity exercise. Ten college age males (24. 0 ± 1. 9 y; mean ± SE), of normal physique (BMI, 23. 7 ± 2. 2 kg • m- 2), performed 4 separate 30 s Wingate tests on an electrically <b>braked,</b> <b>seated,</b> cycle ergometer. Mean power, peak power, time to peak power and rate of fatigue were assessed in 2 way experimental design with factors of Thermal State (normothermia or hyperthermia) and Gas Type (Air or 30 % normoxic nitrous oxide (N 2 O)). Prior to the 2 hyperthermic Wingate tests the TES was elevated to ~ 38. 5 ºC in a 40 ºC bath and without prewarming TES remained at ~ 37. 1 ºC for the 2 normothermic Wingate tests. The main results indicated a significant interaction between Gas Type and Thermal State for mean power(F= 10. 9, P = 0. 01). The mean powerduring the normothermic AIR and hyperthermic AIR condition exercise was similar at ~ 560 watts (W) and it was decreased to 522 ± 145 W in the normothermic N 2 O condition relative to that of 624 ± 129 W in hyperthermic N 2 O condition. After accounting for hyperthermia-induced changes, the changes in mean powerin this interaction was explained by a ~ 18 % increase in mean power between the normothermic N 2 O to the hyperthermic N 2 O exercise condition. In conclusion, for normoxic nitrous oxide breathing, mean power output during hyperthermia is significantly increased relative to that during normothermia. Supported by NSERC and CFI...|$|R
5000|$|There {{was also}} a Deluxe version, known as the V.R. DX cabinet type, {{which is also a}} single-player machine and has a 16:9 aspect-ratio Hantarex monitor (the first use of a {{widescreen}} aspect ratio monitor in an arcade game), and 6 airbags (3 on each side) built into the seat that will inflate and [...] "nudge" [...] the player when cornering, and one more airbag on the player's back that inflates under <b>braking.</b> The <b>seat</b> is also adjustable via [...] "forward" [...] and [...] "back" [...] buttons using air pressure. V.R. DXs force-feedback steering also uses two pneumatic cylinders to rotate the steering wheel, which differ from the electric motor-and-clutch system that the upright and twin versions use (which have no inbuilt air system), so the steering feel is quite different.|$|R
