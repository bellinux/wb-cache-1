500|$|A {{large part}} of Archimedes' work in {{engineering}} arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of Syracuse. The Greek writer Athenaeus of Naucratis described how King Hiero II commissioned Archimedes to design a huge ship, the Syracusia, {{which could be used}} for luxury travel, carrying supplies, and as a naval warship. The Syracusia {{is said to have been}} the largest ship built in classical antiquity. According to Athenaeus, it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations, a gymnasium and a temple dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite among its facilities. Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull, the Archimedes' screw was purportedly developed in order to remove the <b>bilge</b> <b>water.</b> Archimedes' machine was a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade inside a cylinder. It was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer water from a [...] body of water into irrigation canals. The Archimedes' screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated solids such as coal and grain. The Archimedes' screw described in Roman times by Vitruvius may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. The world's first seagoing steamship with a screw propeller was the SS Archimedes, which was launched in 1839 and named in honor of Archimedes and his work on the screw.|$|E

In this paper, surface morphology of paint scheme used in <b>bilges</b> <b>water,</b> is measured by using both optical and AFM (Atomic Force Microscope) to prevent corrosion. Both the strategies are utilized to study natural practices of diverse coatings in addition to the impact of their film development and shades.

One {{of the most frequently}} observed behaviours in the stress-starvation response of gram-negative bacteria is the size reduction and cell morphology conversion from rod to resistant shape-form. In such framework, we report here on morphology (cell volume and cell shape) variations in psychrophilic strain Oleispira antarctica RB 8 T under different growth temperature and different hydrocarbons mixtures sources. Six different hydrocarbons mixtures (car commercial diesel, commercial crude oil engine; 2 different <b>bilge</b> <b>waters,</b> military jet fuel and crude oil) were used as single carbon source and two different cultivation temperatures (4 ° and 15 °C) were tested for 22 days. During incubation period, sub-aliquots of each bacterial culture were processed to estimate total bacterial abundance (DAPI count), variation of cell volume and morphological diversity (determination from digital photomicrographs using an image analysis program). Total bacterial abundance by DAPI staining showed an increase at both temperatures and in almost all substrates used in the first 18 days of experiment; after, values of bacterial abundance by DAPI counts showed a decrement of almost all cultures at both incubation temperatures. Overall, the mean cell volume decreased with increasing of temperature. Three morphological types of bacteria were identified: spiral bacteria (spirillae and curved rods), cocci and rods. The morphological analysis revealed that the spiral bacteria forms changed significantly in coccoid and rods shapes, in relation with the added substrates, except for the <b>bilge</b> <b>waters,</b> where spiral bacteria were mostly the dominant shape. The study of morphological and physiological variation of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria is a fundamental topic for the study of their potential use in the mitigation of oil spills phenomenon in cold environment...|$|R

40|$|Illegal {{discharge}} of <b>bilge</b> <b>waters</b> {{is a significant}} source of oil and other environmental pollutants in Canadian and international waters. Imaging satellites are commonly used to monitor large areas to detect oily discharges from vessels, off-shore platforms and other sources. While remotely sensed imagery provides a snap-shot picture useful for detecting a spill or the presence of vessels in the vicinity, it is difficult to directly associate a vessel to an observed spill unless the vessel is observed while the discharge is occurring. The situation then becomes more challenging with increased vessel traffic as multiple vessels may be associated with a spill event. By combining multiple sources of vessel location data, such as Automated Information Systems (AIS), Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) and SAR-based ship detection, with spill detections and drift models we have created a system that associates detected spill events with vessels in the area using a probabilistic model that intersects vessel tracks and spill drift trajectories in both time and space. Working with the Canadian Space Agency and the Canadian Ice Service’s Integrated Satellite Tracking of Pollution (ISTOP) program, we use spills observed in Canadian waters to demonstrate the investigative value of augmenting spill detections with temporally sequenced vessel and spill tracking information...|$|R

40|$|COD AND TPH ANALYSIS IN SLOPS EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT PLANTS: ANALYTICAL PROBLEMS. In {{the last}} years, the {{persistence}} and accumulation of xenobiotic compounds {{in the environment}} created many disposal problems of oily wastewater generated by ships, mainly in engine-rooms (<b>bilge</b> <b>waters)</b> and by cleaning of tanker (slops). The high salinity levels (up to 25. 000 mgL- 1) and the pollutants concentration, both limit the chances of discharge into the sewer systems and address the disposal of these wastewaters to the sea. For these reasons {{it is necessary to}} treat such wastewater efficiently before discharging [1]. As a part of a broader project concerning slops treatments, this work addresses issues related to the analytical methods of the COD and TPH parameters, chosen under the provisions of Italian Legislative Decree 152 / 06, that implements the European directives on environmental protection. In the COD analysis the greatest difficulty was the high salinity levels corresponding to high chlorides levels. Chlorides cause a positive interference in the measurement, and this interference during the analysis of COD was investigated at various concentrations of mercury {{in order to try to}} minimize the use of this reagent that causes many problems of safety and disposal, and at different times reaction [2][3][4]. The major problems in TPH analysis concerned correct setup of the gas chromatographic separation, high variability in sample composition and the high capacity of the sample to form emulsions during the liquid-liquid extraction procedure. This paper reports the results of the analysis of COD and TPH and the problems related to the development of a suitable analytical method for the analysis of these specimens. This study is part of STITAM European project, created with the aim to develop innovative technologies for the treatment of liquid wastes of navigation, in order to better safeguard marine environment.
