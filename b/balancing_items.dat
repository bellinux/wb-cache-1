40|$|Abstract: An {{important}} part of external or policy shocks is transmitted throughout the economy via various channels of transactions. To analyse such channels and to predict the impact of shocks, it is expedient to know who recently exchanged what with whom and for what purpose. The most appropriate format for presenting intersectoral linkages {{at the national level}} is in a National Accounting Matrix (NAM). A NAM is defined as the presentation of a sequence of integrated accounts and <b>balancing</b> <b>items</b> in a matrix that elaborates the linkages between a supply and use table and institutional sector accounts. This paper compiles the first pilot Euro Area Accounting Matrix (EAAM) and considers its usefulness for the euro area 2 ̆ 019 s economic analysis.

Its empirical modelling framework rests on national input 9 ̆ 6 output accounts which are bilaterally interconnected by international trade at the industry level. Assuming bounded rationality of agents and imperfect markets, an iterative solution algorithm facilitates ex ante simulation studies of the non-equilibrium features of globalizing economies. From a methodological point of view, GINFORS might thus be categorised as a dynamic econometric model. However, its powerful simulation capabilities also provide extensive insights into the broader economy 9 ̆ 6 energy 9 ̆ 6 environment nexus (see, i. a., [URL] or www. topdad. eu/ for ongoing FP 7 research work with references to climate change and the transformation to a low carbon economy {{as well as to}} climate change adaptation policy issues). The GINFORS approach relies heavily on the availability of harmonised international Input 9 ̆ 6 Output datasets (preferably as annual time series). As the May 2012 release of the publicly available World Input Output Database (WIOD, see also [URL] represents outstanding advancements in this regard, we decided to incorporate the WIOD datasets into the GINFORS database.

40|$|Social Accounting Matrices (SAMs) will be {{presented}} as tools that have specific features for studying the socio-economic activity of countries. Such features allow for the reading and interpretation of the reality under study, leading {{to the production of}} an empirical work that is not only capable of highlighting specific aspects of that activity, but also offers the chance to experiment with different interventions in regard to its functioning. In stating that the knowledge of the socio-economic activity of countries involves the use of national accounts, emphasis is placed on the desirability of working in a matrix format, which simultaneously includes activities (or industries), products, factors of production and institutions. This will be considered to be a way of capturing the relevant network of linkages and the corresponding multiplier effects in the subsequent modelling of the socio-economic activity of the countries studied. A methodological framework based on the works of R. Stone, G. Pyatt and J. Round, will be adopted outlining the main features of the SAM-based approach, according to which the SAM can describe the activity of countries either empirically or theoretically, depending on whether it is presented in a numerical or an algebraic version, respectively. Based on the latest version of the System of National Accounts (2008 SNA), a proposal for a numerical version of a SAM will {{be presented}}. Firstly, a basic structure {{will be presented}} and the need to ensure its consistency with the whole system will be emphasized. Such emphasis will then be reinforced through the analysis of possible disaggregations and extensions to that basic structure. The different forms of analysis made possible by the use of aggregates, indicators and <b>balancing</b> <b>items</b> that can be calculated from such a version and which lie outside the matrix format will also be discussed. Because any socio-economic study made of a specific space, namely, a country, should involve the consideration of its population, Socio-Demographic Matrices (SDMs) will also be briefly presented and two examples of approaches based on SAMs and SDMs will be sketched out.

40|$|Several {{different}} areas of the socio-economic activity of countries, and in particu- lar the distribution of income, can be studied with the use of Social Accounting Matrices (SAMs). The features underlying a SAM allow for the reading and interpretation of the socio-economic activity of countries, leading to the production of an empirical work that can highlight specific aspects of the reality under study and offers the chance to perform experiments with changes in those aspects. Thus, SAMs {{can also be used to}} support policy decision processes. With the aid of some methodological principles based on the works of R. Stone, G. Pyatt and J. Round, a SAM-based approach to the study of income distribution is carried out, seeking to provide both an empirical and a theoretical description of the socio-economic activity of a country, respectively through a numerical and an algebraic version of a SAM. The algebraic version can also be referred to as a ‘SAM-based model’. This study uses the nomenclatures of the latest version of the System of National Accounts (2008 SNA). By including production and institutions accounts in a matrix format, the struc- tural features of a country’s production and income distribution can be worked upon together, making it possible to capture specific networks of linkages and the corresponding multiplier effects, in subsequent modelling exercises. A basic SAM is presented, with rows and columns representing accounts. The production accounts are represented by activities (or industries), products (or goods and services), and factors of production. The (domestic) institutions are represented by the current, capital and financial accounts. The rest of the world account represents the “external” part of the (domestic) economy. Bearing in mind the importance of ensuring the consistency of the whole system, possible disaggregations and extensions to that basic structure are analysed. Aggregates and <b>balancing</b> <b>items</b> that can be identified and calculated outside this matrix format are also presented. An assessment of a country’s distribution and use of income is presented, by means of the identification of some of the underlying structural features of SAMs. Macroeconomic effects of changes in income are then identified by way of an experiment with a change in the taxes on income and wealth, paid by the house- holds to the government, using a SAM-based approach. The exposition is accompanied by an example which is applied to Portugal. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the government sector gained prominence after the World War II as the Keynesian theory attributed the government sector key importance in battling economic cycle and the post-war reconstruction and development involved state interventions on a large scale. In 1990 s a strength-ened interest in the government sector was triggered {{by the need to}} coordinate fiscal policies and closely monitor fiscal health in the countries forming the Economic and Monetary Union. Finally, {{in the context of the}} recent global economic crisis, the government sector returned to the centre of the economic policy debate as fiscal policy was used as a main tool to fight the economic recession and subsequently sustainability of government finances became a pressing issue for many countries around the Globe. Increasing importance of the fiscal analysis and fiscal policymaking always generated and continues to generate demand for appropriate statistical data. The international statistical standards played a key role in meeting these requirements. This dissertation offers a comprehensive historical overview, a comparative analysis and evaluation of main internationally recognised statistical standards dealing with the government sector produced by the United Nations, the OECD, the European Communities (Eurostat), the IMF and the European Central Bank. It covers a period since the first international guidelines in late 1940 s up to present. It analyses evolution of the statistical treatment of the government sector including its historical roots and gradual revisions and extensions to reflect changing needs and shifts in economic environment. The study compares individual standards with each other and across time and points out differences in basic definitions, concepts and classifications, the institutional coverage of the government sector, structure of government accounts and <b>balancing</b> <b>items,</b> integration of flow accounts with balance sheets and consolidation of transactions or stocks. The dissertation shows that the international statistical standards were successful in offering common statistical guidance, recommendations and best practices. The international organizations have proven to be well suited to deliver widely acknowledged standards. Their cooperation with national statistical agencies and engagement of the most competent experts in the field contributed to building credibility of these statistical systems, if properly applied. The comparative analysis also demonstrates a clear long-term effort of the international statistical community to enhance international harmonization. The application of the international statistical standards also improved quality and availability of government statistics as individual countries are in principle bound [...] through their memberships in the international organizations [...] to compile agreed data on the basis of a common methodology. This was in particular the case for EU countries for which provision of statistical data according to a given standard is legally binding, as the data are relevant for budgetary and surveillance procedures. As a special case, the history since early 1990 s and current situation of statistics on the government sector in the Czech Republic is presented...|$|E

40|$|Recently, Fausten and Brooks offered (what {{they refer}} to as) an ‘impressionistic view’ of the {{temporal}} evolution of Australia's <b>balancing</b> <b>item,</b> which {{is a measure of}} the accuracy of the balance of payments accounts. They claim that the <b>balancing</b> <b>item</b> ‘has been increasing in magnitude and volatility, violating with increasing frequency internationally agreed acceptability criteria for smallness. In the present paper it is shown that Fausten and Brooks results derive from data that incorporates excessively a dynamically asymmetric concentration of revisions and is therefore unsuitable for statistical analysis. This paper develops, and empirically evaluates, a model of the process of revisions of balance of payments data. This model illustrates that dynamically inconsistent time series of the <b>balancing</b> <b>item,</b> such as that employed by Fausten and Brooks, are bound to generate an artificial impression that it follows an ‘explosive’ time trend. Subsequently, it is illustrated that when alternative, dynamically consistent editions of the <b>balancing</b> <b>item</b> data for the same period as that examined by Fausten and Brooks are employed, their results are reversed. Indeed, the findings here contradict diametrically the conclusions of these authors by suggesting that the decline in the frequency of <b>balancing</b> <b>item</b> ‘violations’ observed in the latter portion of the relevant time period is unparalleled in the history of the balance of payments accounts. ...|$|R

Moreover, the operation of TGD also changed the river–lake relationship in the lower Yangtze River basin; (3) the coupling effects of drought and TGD on the lake water balance has been analyzed by using composite analysis method and it can be found that the operation of TGD has significantly altered the lake water balance. But it is not the only factor that affects the lake water balance, and the droughts might cause their relations to be much more complicated.|$|R
