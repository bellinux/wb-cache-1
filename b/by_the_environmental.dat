5|$|Tangascootack Creek's {{watershed}} covers 36.4 {{square miles}} (94km2) {{in the southern}} part of Clinton County, half of which is the watershed for North Fork Tangascootack Creek. A small amount of the watershed, less than 1%, has occasional residential uses, including sport camps and summer retreats. In formerly strip-mined areas there are patches of grassland and reforestation. Almost all of the area that is considered impaired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environmental</b> Protection Agency, is forested. However, in areas where strip mining was done in the past, there are patches of grassland or reforested land. This land includes sports camps and summer retreats.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, Hershey Creamery Company {{became the}} first company {{in the nation to}} be prosecuted and fined for failing to {{implement}} a Risk Management Program (RMP) as required by the Clean Air Act. The charges were brought <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environmental</b> Protection Agency (EPA), which stated that the company failed to develop the required plans with regard to its storage and use of anhydrous ammonia, which is a regulated substance. In the charges, the EPA noted that the creamery twice certified that it had developed the RMP plan, once in 1999 and again in 2004. Later inspection showed that the certifications were false and on December 7, 2006, the EPA issued a civil compliance order against the company, ordering the company to come into compliance. Hershey Creamery complied and in April 2007 submitted the appropriate RMPs, which were confirmed to be in-place through subsequent inspection. The case was heard at the Federal Middle District court of Pennsylvania, with Hershey Creamery pleading guilty to the charges; it was subsequently fined $100,000 and given a year probation.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear {{power and}} fossil fuels are subsidized by many governments, and wind power {{and other forms}} of {{renewable}} energy are also often subsidized. For example, a 2009 study <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environmental</b> Law Institute assessed the size and structure of U.S. energy subsidies over the 2002–2008 period. The study estimated that subsidies to fossil-fuel based sources amounted to approximately $72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totalled $29 billion. In the United States, the federal government has paid US$74billion for energy subsidies to support R for nuclear power ($50 billion) and fossil fuels ($24 billion) from 1973 to 2003. During this same time frame, renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency received a total of US$26billion. It has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help {{to level the playing field}} and support growing energy sectors, namely solar power, wind power, and biofuels. History shows that no energy sector was developed without subsidies.|$|E

5|$|The {{proposed}} Perth Bunbury Highway Peel deviation, part {{of which}} later became an extension to Kwinana Freeway, underwent a public environmental review in 1997, and an environmental assessment <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environmental</b> Protection Authority (EPA) in 2000. The relevant environment factors considered by the EPA were vegetation communities, declared rare and priority flora, wetlands, and traffic noise. Main Roads proposed management plans for each factor. Only clearing of vegetation critical for road construction would be undertaken, and more vegetation would be replaced than the amount impacted, using local native species. A survey for declared rare and priority flora found no rare species, and only one priority species, Lasiopetalum membranaceum, near {{the southern end of}} the project. Road construction would impact one conservation class wetland, but no protected wetlands. To minimise impact, road drainage would be designed to contain spills and prevent direct discharges into the surrounding environment. Noise levels would be contained to an acceptable limit in the road design, in accordance with the Main Roads traffic noise policy. The EPA concluded that the road could be designed and managed to an acceptable standard. Main Roads' 2006 plan for environmental management of the project included numerous aspects, which for the northern segment of the project exceeded the environmental approval requirements. Specific plans were developed regarding fauna, topsoil management, construction, foreshores, and both Aboriginal and European heritage.|$|E
5|$|This event {{creating}} a sustainable and reliable {{relationship with the}} general public is {{a significant part of}} THSRC’s corporate vision and an important foundation of environmental and social sustainability. Therefore, it will continue making efforts to establish a good partnership with the general public {{as well as with the}} stakeholders, customers, employees, suppliers, communities and the government. To create greater value for each of these parties, it will move forward with its philosophy of “Go Extra Mile” to improve their lives through the provision of environmentally friendly high-speed rail services, which play a central role in connecting the entire western corridor of Taiwan. Since operation in 2007, THSRC has been dedicated to CSR initiatives, emphasizing environmental protection and giving support to all members of the communities served by THSRC. THSRC also published the first CSR Report in 2009, which gave all stakeholders a better understanding of its CSR objectives and activities, and in 2011, we received the 20th Annual Enterprises Environmental Protection Award, sponsored <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environmental</b> Protection Administration of Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the time step chosen within the model {{is related to the}} {{distance}} between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain numerical stability. Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes, while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes. The global models are run at varying times into the future. The Met Office's Unified Model is run six days into the future, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model is run out to 10days into the future, while the Global Forecast System model run <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environmental</b> Modeling Center is run 16days into the future. The visual output produced by a model solution is known as a prognostic chart, or prog. The raw output is often modified before being presented as the forecast. This can be in the form of statistical techniques to remove known biases in the model, or of adjustment to take into account consensus among other numerical weather forecasts. MOS or model output statistics is a technique used to interpret numerical model output and produce site-specific guidance. This guidance is presented in coded numerical form, and can be obtained for nearly all National Weather Service reporting stations in the United States. As proposed by Edward Lorenz in 1963, long range forecasts, those made at a range of two weeks or more, are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere, owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved. In numerical models, extremely small errors in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and wind velocity.|$|E
