5|$|Since {{they are}} morally equivalent, {{perhaps it is}} not {{surprising}} that the cure for political injustices is identical to the cure for economic ones: namely, the institution of democracy in <b>both</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> political spheres (Russell 1938:234).|$|E

5|$|Sihanouk came {{to believe}} that {{communist}} triumph in Southeast Asia was inevitable and that Cambodia's military was incapable of defeating the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), even with U.S. support. If Cambodia (and his rule) was to survive, he would have to make a bargain with the devil. On 10 April 1965 he broke off diplomatic relations with the U.S. and swung politically to the left. To gain foreign support, <b>both</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> political, Sihanouk turned to the People's Republic of China. One of the terms of the agreement between Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai was that Cambodia would allow the use of its eastern border by the North Vietnamese in their effort to reunify the two Vietnams.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the auspices}} of a régime d'exception (the {{equivalent}} {{of a state of}} emergency), Mobutu assumed sweeping, almost absolute, power for five years after which, he claimed, democracy would be restored. Mobutu's coup, which promised <b>both</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> political stability, was supported by the United States and other Western governments. Initially, his rule met widespread popularity. He increasingly took other powers, abolishing the post of Prime Minister in 1966 and dissolving Parliament in 1967.|$|E

The results suggest that oil prices {{have a significant effect}} on <b>both</b> <b>economic</b> activity <b>and</b> price indexes although the impact is limited to the short-run and more significant when oil price shocks are defined in local currencies. Moreover, we find evidence of asymmetries in the oil prices-macroeconomy relationship for some of the Asian countries. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{economics}} {{of global warming}} concerns the economic aspects of global warming; this can inform policies that governments might consider in response. A number of factors make this a difficult problem from <b>both</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> political perspectives: it is a long-term, intergenerational problem; benefits and costs are distributed unequally both within and across countries; and scientific and public opinions may diverge.|$|E

25|$|In 1048, for <b>both</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> popular reasons, the Zirids {{dramatically}} {{broke with}} the Shi'a Fatimid Caliphate, who had ruled them from Cairo. Instead the Zirids chose to become Sunni (always favored by most Maghribi Muslims) and hence declared their {{allegiance to the}} moribund Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad. Consequently, many shia were killed during disturbances throughout Ifriqiya. The Zirid state seized Fatimid wealth and coinage. Sunni Maliki jurists were reestablished as the prevailing school of law.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergence}} of a bourgeois public sphere was particularly supported by the 18th-century liberal democracy making resources available to this new political class to establish a network of institutions like publishing enterprises, newspapers and discussion forums, and the democratic press was the main tool to execute this. The key feature of this public sphere was its separation from the power of both {{the church and the}} government due to its access to a variety of resources, <b>both</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> social.|$|E
25|$|The {{limitations}} of contour strip mining are <b>both</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> technical. When the operation reaches a predetermined stripping ratio (tons of overburden/tons of coal), {{it is not}} profitable to continue. Depending on the equipment available, {{it may not be}} technically feasible to exceed a certain height of highwall. At this point, it is possible to produce more coal with the augering method in which spiral drills bore tunnels into a highwall laterally from the bench to extract coal without removing the overburden.|$|E

25|$|After leaving Washington, Burr {{traveled}} west {{seeking new}} opportunities, <b>both</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> political.

The subsequent trial resulted in acquittal, but Burr's western schemes left him with large debts and few influential friends. In a final quest for grand opportunities, he left the United States for Europe. He remained overseas until 1812, {{when he returned to}} the United States to practice law in New York City. There he spent the rest of his life in relative obscurity.|$|E
25|$|Ambushes on key {{transportation}} routes are {{a hallmark}} of guerrilla operations, causing <b>both</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> political disruption. Careful planning is required for operations, indicated here by VC preparation of the withdrawal route. In this case the Viet Cong assault was broken up by American aircraft and firepower. However, the VC did destroy several vehicles and {{the bulk of the}} main VC force escaped. As in most of the Vietnam War, American forces would eventually leave the area, but the insurgents would regroup and return afterwards. This time dimension is also integral to guerrilla tactics.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} North India is {{predominantly}} agrarian, but is changing fast with {{rapid economic growth}} that has ranged above 8% annually. Several parts of North India have prospered {{as a consequence of}} the Green Revolution, including Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh, and have experienced <b>both</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> social development. The eastern areas of East Uttar Pradesh, however, have lagged and the resulting disparity has contributed to a demand for separate statehood in West Uttar Pradesh (the Harit Pradesh movement). Bihar's economy has been the fastest growing state economy in India, higher than all the Indian states including Gujarat.|$|E
