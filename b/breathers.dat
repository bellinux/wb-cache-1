5|$|Air {{breathing}} {{fish can}} be divided into obligate air <b>breathers</b> and facultative air <b>breathers.</b> Obligate air <b>breathers,</b> such as the African lungfish, must breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air <b>breathers,</b> such as the catfish Hypostomus plecostomus, only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air <b>breathers</b> that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most animals, {{porpoises}} are conscious <b>breathers.</b> All mammals sleep, but porpoises cannot {{afford to}} become unconscious for long {{because they may}} drown. While knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited, porpoises in captivity have been recorded to sleep with one side of their brain at a time, {{so that they may}} swim, breathe consciously, and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most animals, {{whales are}} {{conscious}} <b>breathers.</b> All mammals sleep, but whales cannot afford to become unconscious for long {{because they may}} drown. They are believed to exhibit unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, in which they sleep {{with half of the}} brain while the other half remains active. This behavior was only documented in toothed whales until footage of a humpback whale sleeping (vertically) was shot in 2014.|$|E

5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin {{has a single}} blowhole located on the dorsal surface of the head consisting of a hole and a muscular flap. The flap is closed during muscle relaxation and opens during contraction. Dolphins are voluntary <b>breathers,</b> who must deliberately surface and open their blowholes to get air. They can store almost twice as much oxygen in proportion to their body weight as a human can: the dolphin can store 36 milliliters (ml) of oxygen per kg of body weight, compared with 20 ml per kg for humans. This is an adaptation to diving. The {{bottlenose dolphin}} typically rises to the surface to breathe through its blowhole {{two to three times}} per minute, although it can remain submerged for up to 20 minutes.|$|E

A new family of homoclinic <b>breather</b> wave solution, and rational homoclinic solution (homoclinic rogue wave) for DSI and DSII equations are obtained using the extended homoclinic test method and homoclinic <b>breather</b> limit method (HBLM), respectively. Moreover, rogue wave solution is exhibited as period of periodic wave in homoclinic <b>breather</b> wave approaches to infinite.

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears at a vanity, putting Curious on and {{earrings}} by Bulgari. She is then seen holding a top hat {{in front of}} her face, while doves fly out of another hat. Spears starts singing in the vanity but stands up and puts on a ringmaster jacket. She walks through an aisle while dancing suggestively with several circus dancers. Throughout the video, there are interspersed scenes of different circus performers, including ribbon dancers, contortionists, clowns and a mime on stilts. There are also scenes of Spears singing with the top hat, wearing a nude body stocking in front of a red curtain, with a spotlight on her. This is followed by a group dance scene {{in the middle of a}} circus ring, where Spears wears the ringmaster jacket, sequined hot pants and a feathered top hat. In the second verse, she dances with a chair and a whip wearing a nude bra covered in leaves. The video continues with a series of intercut scenes, such as Spears in slow motion in front of a shower of sparks, her surrounded by a pair of lions and in front of an elephant. During the bridge, Spears and her dancers perform a routine in front of flames. In the last chorus, Spears returns to the circus ring, surrounded by two elephants, many more circus performers, dancers and fire <b>breathers.</b> The video ends with Spears in the spotlight, laughing with the top hat over her head.|$|E

25|$|Temnodontosaurus {{species are}} {{sometimes}} mistaken for dolphin relatives {{due to their}} similar overall morphology. However, the morphological traits are convergent. Temnodontosaurus were not mammals but were large marine reptiles and their ancestors were land dwelling reptiles. Temnodontosaurus do have morphological traits which differ from Cetacea also. Temnodontosaurus tail would beat laterally side to side, instead of up and down. Temnodontosaurus skull's also have nostrils that are {{placed in front of}} the eyes instead of on the dorsal side of the head like Cetaceans. Though reptiles, Temnodontosaurus can also be mistaken for fish due to their fins and elongate undifferentiated body, but unlike fish Temnodontosaurus are air <b>breathers</b> and must go to the water’s surface for air. Also Temnodontosaurus, like other Ichthyosaurs, are viviparous.|$|E
25|$|In other craniofacial syndromes, the {{abnormal}} feature {{may actually}} improve the airway, but its correction may put the {{person at risk}} for obstructive sleep apnea after surgery when it is modified. Cleft palate syndromes are such an example. During the newborn period, all humans are obligate nasal <b>breathers.</b> The palate is both {{the roof of the}} mouth and the floor of the nose. Having an open palate may make feeding difficult, but generally, does not interfere with breathing, in fact, if the nose is very obstructed, then an open palate may relieve breathing. There are a number of clefting syndromes in which the open palate is not the only abnormal feature; additionally, there is a narrow nasal passage - which may not be obvious. In such individuals, closure of the cleft palate – whether by surgery or by a temporary oral appliance, can cause the onset of obstruction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Dynamics of a sine-Gordon kink and small-amplitude <b>breather</b> bound on an {{attractive}} localised inhomogeneity are studied. The rates of energy emission from the kink oscillating near the inhomogeneity {{and from a}} quiescent <b>breather</b> performing internal oscillations are calculated. In the semiclassical approximation, discrete quantised energy spectra for the solitons of both types are found, with regard to field-theory corrections to a kink’s particle-like spectrum and to strong distortion of the <b>breather’s</b> shape. The rates of radiative energy emission are interpreted as finite widths of the quantised quasiclassical energy levels. Oscillations of the <b>breather</b> as a whole near the inhomogeneity are also considered...|$|R

Detailed analysis indicates that modulational instability plays dominant roles in mechanism of Kuznetsov-Ma <b>breather</b> admitting weak perturbations, and the interference effect plays dominant role for the Kuznetsov-Ma <b>breather</b> admitting strong perturbations. For intermediate cases, the two mechanisms are both involved greatly. These characters provide a possible way to understand the evolution of strong perturbations on a plane wave background.

500|$|News anchor Couric made a guest {{appearance}} in the episode as herself. She was {{a fan of the}} series prior to her casting, having praised its handling of subject matters such as homosexuality, disabilities and teenage pregnancy. Brian Stelter of The New York Times noted that her appearance was unusual, as anchors from rival networks—in Couric's case, CBS—do not typically make cameos on their competitors' programs. Series regular Chris Colfer and recurring guest star Darren Criss {{were not included in the}} original draft of the script, but were added by series creator Murphy in a late revision. Other recurring characters who appear are football coach Shannon Beiste, glee club members Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.), Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) and Lauren Zizes, cheerleader Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter) and school bullies Dave Karofsky and Azimio (James Earl). Two new football-playing characters were introduced: Scott Cooper and Strando, who E! columnist Kristin dos Santos reported might have an increased role in the series as it continued. However, they did not make any additional appearances on the show in its second season. Additionally, producers hired fire <b>breathers,</b> jugglers, and bicycle motocross stunt performers for the episode. 500 extras were used, as well as the University of Southern California Trojan Marching Band. In January 2011, entertainment website Zap2it reported that Filipina singer Charice would appear as exchange student Sunshine Corazon, performing The Black Eyed Peas' [...] "Meet Me Halfway" [...] with rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline.
