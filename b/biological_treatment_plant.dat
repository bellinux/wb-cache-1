50|$|It is {{estimated}} that in 2000 the urban areas of Ghana generated about 763,698 m3 of wastewater each day, resulting in approximately 280 million m3 over the entire year. Regional capitals count for another 180 million m3. Only a small share of the generated urban wastewater is collected, and an even smaller share is being treated. Inadequate management of urban, industrial and agricultural wastewater often means that the drinking-water {{of millions of people}} is either dangerously contaminated or chemically polluted. In Accra, the share of wastewater collected is approximately 10%. Moreover, less than 25% of the 46 industrial and municipal treatment plants in Ghana were functional according to an inventory undertaken by the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency in 2001. Treatment plants for municipal wastewater are operated by local governments, {{and most of them are}} stabilization ponds.

40|$|Following {{a long-distance}} {{outbreak}} of Legionnaires' disease from an industrial air scrubber in Norway in 2005, a seroepidemiological study measuring levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies to Legionella pneumophila was performed with a polyvalent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. One {{year after the}} outbreak, IgG levels in employees (n = 213) at the industrial plant harboring the scrubber and in blood donors (n = 398) from the outbreak county were low but significantly higher (P ≤ 0. 002) than those in blood donors (n = 406) from a nonexposed county. No differences in IgM levels among the three groups were found after adjustment for gender and age. Home addresses of the seroresponders in the exposed county clustered {{to the city of}} the outbreak, in contrast to the scattering of addresses of the seroresponding donors in the nonexposed county. Factory employees who operated at an open <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> had significantly higher IgG and IgM levels (P ≤ 0. 034) than those working > 200 m away.

25|$|The {{level of}} {{contamination}} of the feedstock material is a key consideration. If the feedstock to the digesters has significant levels of physical contaminants, such as plastic, glass, or metals, then processing to remove the contaminants will be required for the material to be used. If it is not removed, then the digesters can be blocked and will not function efficiently. It is with this understanding that mechanical <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> are designed. The higher the level of pretreatment a feedstock requires, the more processing machinery will be required, and, hence, the project will have higher capital costs.|$|R
30|$|Design, {{monitoring}} and performance-evaluation of a <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> exclusively {{depend on the}} microbial growth parameters of the wastewater. Due {{to the lack of}} proper growth kinetics data, most of the biological reactors, in most cases, are found to have poor design dimension and uneven treatment results (Kovar and Egli 1998; Metcalf and Eddy 2005). To overcome this situation oxygen uptake measurement can be a good alternative for the designer, investor and plant operators. Unlike BOD test, the respirometric method provides adequate data for such analysis. In the following sections, model-based discussion has been made on the relationship between the oxygen uptake rate and the microbial growth kinetics, and also the procedure of the determination of the biokinetic coefficients from the oxygen uptake data obtained from BMRS has been illustrated. Thus the data already presented in Fig.  5 undergo further treatment to determine biokinetic coefficients.|$|E

The investigations were conducted as a field experiment in the years 2005 - 2007 on the silt loam soil classified as Stagnic Gleysol.
