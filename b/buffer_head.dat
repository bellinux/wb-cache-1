50|$|The MG 3 is an automatic, air-cooled, belt-fed short recoil-operated firearm. It {{features}} a roller locked bolt mechanism {{that consists of}} the bolt head, a pair of rollers, the striker sleeve, bolt body and return spring. The bolt is locked securely by a wedge-shaped striker sleeve, which forces two cylindrical rollers contained in the bolt head outward, and into corresponding recesses in {{the extension of the}} breech of the barrel. On firing, both the barrel and barrel extension recoil to the rear. The resulting impact (much like a Newton's cradle) moves the carrier to the rear withdrawing the wedge and both rollers as they are cammed inward and out of their sockets by fixed cams, unlocking the bolt head. The bolt carrier and bolt then continue to the rear together guided by fixed guides while the barrel and barrel extension return to battery. Upon return of the bolt forward, the impact of the rollers against the camming surfaces on the breech carry the rollers from their seats, and, together with the surfaces on the striker sleeve, force the rollers outward, locking the bolt head into the barrel extension and ensuring a complete lock. The bolt also houses a spring-loaded casing extractor and ejector. Ejection is carried out when the ejector strikes the <b>buffer</b> <b>head,</b> sending a push forward through the ejector bar, which hits the ejector pin. This pin pushes the top of the base of the cartridge, which is still held by the extractor at the base, causing the empty casing to rotate and eject downward through the ejection chute.|$|E
40|$|Railway buffers {{during the}} {{operation}} are staying in almost permanent contact with each other, creating friction node in {{the point of}} contact of two railway buffer heads. In consequence of overcoming track curves, turnouts and unevenness of track, the railway buffer heads moves relative to each other causing friction, which results in its wear. When the wear is excessive, {{it might be a}} reason to withdrawn vehicle from service, it causes flattening of <b>buffer</b> <b>head,</b> and in consequence its abnormal cooperation. To avoid this phenomenon the buffer heads should be covered with graphitized grease, but this method has many disadvantages. Accordingly, it was found that it would be beneficial to cover the <b>buffer</b> <b>head</b> with bronze using laser cladding. In this article the metallographic and mechanical analysis of the newly created top layer of railway <b>buffer</b> <b>head</b> are presented.

40|$|A {{protocol}} named Threshold Bipolar (TB) {{is proposed}} as a fetching strategy at the startup stage of p 2 p live streaming systems. In this protocol, chunks are fetched consecutively from <b>buffer</b> <b>head</b> at the beginning. After the buffer is filled into a threshold, chunks at the buffer tail will be fetched first {{while keeping the}} contiguously filled part in the buffer above the threshold even when the buffer is drained at a playback rate. High download rate, small startup latency and natural strategy handover {{can be reached at}} the same time by this protocol. Important parameters in this protocol are identified. The buffer progress under this protocol is then expressed as piecewise lines specified by those parameters. Startup traces of peers measured from PPLive are studied to show the real performance of TB protocol in a real system. A simple design model of TB protocol is proposed to reveal important considerations in a practical design. Comment: 9 pages, 11 figure...|$|E

40|$|Traumatic rupture of the aorta (TRA) {{remains the}} second most common cause of death {{associated}} with motor vehicle crashes after brain injury. On an average, nearly 8, 000 people die annually in the United States due to blunt injury to the aorta. It is observed that more than 80 % of occupants who suffer an aortic injury die at the scene due to exsanguination into the chest. With the advent of more accurate and established human body finite element (FE) models, FE crash reconstruction methods may become a valuable tool when assessing crash scenarios and occupant injury mechanisms. The current study is divided into five main aims, near side left lateral real world finite element reconstructions, sensitivity study, thresholds for TRA, aorta mechanics in racing crashes and conceptual countermeasures. In the first study eight nearside left lateral impacts, in which a TRA occurred, were reconstructed using a combination of real world crash data reported in the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN) database and FE models of vehicles and occupants. The average maximum principal strain (AMPS) in the root, ascending, and the isthmus regions of the aorta were calculated and model predicted high strain areas were compared with real world injury reports. In seven of the eight cases aortic failure occurred in the isthmus region and, the average peak tensile isthmic strain, 20 ± 7 mm distal to the left subclavian artery, was 18 ± 6 %. To identify key parameters for injury causation, 16 Design of Computer Experiments (DOCE) runs, generated using a Latin square sampling technique on modeFRONTIER with FE models of vehicles and the WSHBM as described earlier were performed to evaluate the role of PDOF, impact velocity, impact position, impact height and occupant seating position on aortic strain, aortic pressure and compartmental intrusion. The AMPS decreased significantly with an increase in the PDOF (from 270 degrees). Of the four PDOFs simulated, a PDOF of 270 degrees generated the highest average maximum principal strain in the aorta. Further, strain increased with increase in impact velocity while pressure in the aorta decreased with an increase in PDOF (from 270 degrees). The data obtained in the CIREN reconstructions were further compared with three CIREN cases without aortic injury to understand and delineate the mechanism for TRA. A paired comparison based sensitivity study was carried out and data compared with literature. It was seen that in nearside left lateral impacts the PDOF of impact {{played a crucial role in}} TRA. Further, three Indycar based racing crashes were simulated as part of a comparison study involving nine other simulated cases. It was seen that for TRA to occur, acceleration along was not enough. Thoracic deformation was essential and the shoulder-clavicle complex played a crucial role in TRA by causing relative motion of the sternum and the thoracic spine. Utilizing six design factors; B-pillar beam, crossbeam, side conceptual blanket airbag, thickness factor, yield strength and by varying the dimensions of the B-pillar beam, 18 DOCE simulations were carried out. The current study suggest that the protective effects of an improved side-construction standard can be enhanced further by the more rational placement of an airbag-like structure, to <b>buffer</b> <b>head</b> and chest contact with the B-Pillar along its entire length from car seat to roof. It is suggested that the combination of these two safety measures, B-pillar beam and thickness is likely to result in a significant reduction in both head and aortic Isthmus injury and thus to substantially reduce mortality subsequent to lateral motor vehicle crashes...|$|E

5000|$|There {{were several}} {{modifications}} form the standard US design. One is the alteration to the bogie pivot pin {{from the usual}} centre position to a point 18 in towards the buffer beam. The alteration enabled the locos to travel the tight curves found in the works, and also reduced excessive buffer and coupler misalignment. Deep buffer beams were fitted with a 3+1/2 in rail clearance, to minimise damage during derailments. To reduce excessive body roll due to poor track conditions, extra bearing pads were fitted {{to the outside of}} the bogie frame and the main frame. The fitting of large [...] capacity air reservoirs on each side enabled the locos to be used with 6 of the pneumatic dump cars in use at the steelworks. Also as the standard US design did not have buffers fitted, the BHP locos were fitted with buffers with oversized <b>buffer</b> <b>heads,</b> necessary for the tight curves and BHP’s own internal rolling stock.|$|R
40|$|Previous work {{proposes a}} dependence-based {{scheduling}} technique {{in which the}} scheduling window is partitioned {{into a number of}} FIFO <b>buffers,</b> the <b>heads</b> of which constitute the set of instructions eligible for execution each cycle. In that work, empirical evaluation promises very modest IPC losses relative to a conventional scheduler, but we find in our own implementation that losses are severe — about sixfold higher than those originally reported. We show that those losses arise because the dependence-based steering policy, which is responsible for distributing instructions among the FIFO buffers, must frequently stall for lack of a suitable buffer into which the next instruction can be slotted. That problem, in turn, arises because dynamic dataflow is simply not of a shape that is amenable to being mapped onto just a few FIFO buffers, at least not by means of the proposed steering policy. We postulate that the original study produced good results because it evaluated the new scheduler in a machine whose performance bottleneck lay outside the execution core. The problems introduced by the steering logic were, as a result, hidden. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{cationic}} amphipathic designer peptide LAH 4 exhibits potent antimicrobial, {{nucleic acid}} transfection and cell penetration activities. Closely related derivatives {{have been developed}} to enhance viral transduction for gene therapeutic assays. LAH 4 contains four histidines and, consequently, its overall charge and membrane topology in lipid bilayers are strongly pH dependent. In order to better understand the differential interactions of this amphipathic peptide with negatively-charged membranes its interactions, topologies, and penetration depth were investigated in the presence of lipid bilayers as a function of pH, <b>buffer,</b> phospholipid <b>head</b> group, and fatty acyl chain composition using a combination of oriented synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectroscopy as well as oriented and non-oriented solid-state NMR spectroscopy. This combination of methods indicates that in the presence of lipids with phosphatidylglycerol head groups, the topological equilibria of LAH 4 is shifted towards more in-plane configurations even at neutral pH. In contrast, a transmembrane alignment is promoted when LAH 4 interacts with membranes made of dimyristoyl phospholipids rather than palmitoyl-oleoyl-phospholipids. Finally, the addition of citrate buffer favours LAH 4 transmembrane alignments, even at low pH, probably by complex formation with the cationic charges of the peptide. In summary, this study has revealed that the membrane topology of this peptide is readily modulated by the environmental conditions...|$|R
30|$|Traffic safety mapping and {{the first}} {{scheduling}} There {{are two kinds of}} information flow according to the quality of their relationships with traffic safety: one can provide safe high-effect transportation guarantee to the monitored VSs, such as security early warning and effective navigation, which should be issued to the related VS terminals quickly and reliably, so as to avoid and reduce the number of traffic accidents effectively through an active way of warning, or improve the traffic efficiency through active guidance or independent inquiry for auxiliary driving; the other one can provide various multimedia or mobile Internet application services on demand, such as VoIP, video conference, web browsing, etc., which should be initiated by the related VS terminals, so as to enrich passengers’ driving experience. Obviously, it is more urgent to transmit the first kind of information flows as soon as possible which closely related to traffic safety if compared with the other kind of information flows. In order to provide differentiated transmission services to the above mentioned two kinds of information flows, packets generated from the information flow generator will be firstly classified into two classes based on traffic safety characteristics by traffic safety mapper: information flow packets closely related to traffic safety will be mapped into the first buffer queue in a sequence and associated with a larger value of traffic safety importance weight; information flow packets aiming at enriching passengers’ driving experience will be mapped into the second buffer queue in a sequence and associated with a smaller value of traffic safety importance weight. At each scheduling time, the first level scheduler will decide the scheduling order of traffic safety <b>buffer</b> queues’ <b>head</b> of line (HOL) packets: HOL packet from the first buffer queue with larger weight will be always delivered to the next service type mapper prior to HOL packet from the second buffer queue with smaller weight.|$|R
40|$|Background: Female Aedes aegypti {{mosquitoes}} are {{the principal}} vector for dengue fever, causing 50 – 100 million infections per year, transmitted between human and mosquito by blood feeding. Ae. aegypti host-seeking behavior {{is known to be}} inhibited for three days following a blood meal by a hemolymph-borne humoral factor. Head Peptide-I is a candidate peptide mediating this suppression, but the mechanism by which this peptide alters mosquito behavior and the receptor through which it signals are unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: Head Peptide-I shows sequence similarity to short Neuropeptide-F peptides (sNPFs) that have been implicated in feeding behaviors and are known to signal through Neuropeptide Y (NPY) -Like Receptors (NPYLRs). We identified eight NPYLRs in the Ae. aegypti genome and screened each in a cell-based calcium imaging assay for sensitivity against a panel of peptides. Four of the Ae. aegypti NPYLRs responded to one or more peptide ligands, but only NYPLR 1 responded to Head Peptide-I as well as sNPFs. Two NPYLR 1 homologues identified in the genome of the Lyme disease vector, Ixodes scapularis, were also sensitive to Head Peptide-I. Injection of synthetic Head Peptide-I and sNPF- 3 inhibited host-seeking behavior in non-blood-fed female mosquitoes, whereas control injections of <b>buffer</b> or inactive <b>Head</b> Peptide-I [Cys 10] had no effect. To ask if NPYLR 1 is necessary for blood-feeding-induced host-seeking inhibition, we used zinc-finger nucleases to generate five independent npylr 1 null mutant strains and tested them for behavioral abnormalities...|$|R
