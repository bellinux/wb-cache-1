50|$|Multi-jackbolt {{tensioners}} (MJTs), registered {{under the}} trademark Superbolt or Supernut, {{are designed to}} decrease the torque required to tighten large bolted joints. One of the major problems associated with traditional <b>bolt</b> <b>tightening</b> methods is as {{the diameter of the}} bolt increases, the amount of torque required to tighten it increases in the third power of the diameter. Because of this, the largest size bolt a person can typically tighten by hand is 1".Multi-jackbolt tensioners reduce the amount of torque required to clamp the joint by using multiple jackbolts threaded through the nut or bolt head.The jackbolts, which are small enough to be tightened by simple hand tools, thrust against a hardened washer and generate clamping force on the joint. Loads up to 20,000,000 pounds and greater are attainable using only hand tools. MJTs and related products are produced by Superbolt, Inc. in Carnegie, PA.|$|E
5000|$|On September 22, 2016, the Ministry of Transportation {{released}} several {{reports on}} the technical causes of the January 10, 2016 bearing failure. Two reports, from Surface Science Western and National Research Council Canada, were released pertaining solely {{to the analysis of}} the failed bolts connecting the bearing to the bridge girders. They both found that the bolts met all required standards and they failed progressively due to severe overloading beyond their capacities. The second component of the analysis involved an engineering evaluation, undertaken by ministry bridge engineers and an independent engineering consultant. They both found that there were 3 main causes for the failure; 1) The shoe plate, which connects the bearing to the girder, was too flexible - creating [...] "prying action" [...] which amplified the forces on some bolts, 2) The bearings could not properly rotate, increasing the load on some bolts, 3) <b>Bolt</b> <b>tightening</b> was not performed, subjecting the bolts to fatigue. The ministry also revealed that the permanent repair to the bridge would involve a [...] "linkage" [...] system that would hold down the bridge and allow horizontal movements due to thermal expansion and contraction of the bridge superstructure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Plastic region {{tightening}} {{is widely}} used in critical bolted joints in internal combustion engines {{in order to reduce}} the engine weight by maximizing the use of load-carrying capacity of bolt. Mechanical behavior of <b>bolt</b> <b>tightened</b> in plastic region under external axial tensile load is investigated for various friction conditions using three dimensional finite element analysis. The behavior of <b>bolt</b> <b>tightened</b> in elastic region as well as that in tensile test are investigated for comparison. Tightening process is simulated by rotating the bolt in order to examine the friction effect realistically. It is revealed that the <b>bolt</b> <b>tightened</b> in plastic region can carry more external load until the joint is opened, and yields at lower bolt load than the <b>bolt</b> <b>tightened</b> in elastic region. The friction coefficient has effect on the yield load, but not on the load-carrying capacity. Moreover, the scatter in the bolt preload due to friction begins with plastic deformation of bolt in the angle tightening control, whereas it begins with the onset of tightening in the torque tightening control. The observations are interpreted with the residual torsional stress in the bolt generated during the tightening...|$|R

40|$|Large fuel casks {{subjected}} to the combined loads of closure <b>bolt</b> <b>tightening,</b> internal pressure and sequential dynamic impacts present challenges when evaluating their performance in the Hypothetical Accident Conditions (HAC) specified in the Code of Federal Regulations Title 10 Part 71 (10 CFR 71). Testing is often limited by cost, difficulty in preparing test units and the limited availability of facilities which can carry out such tests. In the past, many casks were evaluated without testing by using simplified analytical methods. In addition, there are no realistic analyses of closure bolt stresses for HAC conditions reported in the open literature. This paper presents a numerical technique for analyzing the accumulated damages of a large fuel cask caused by the sequential loads of the closure <b>bolt</b> <b>tightening</b> and the internal pressure {{as well as the}} drop and crash dynamic loads. The bolt preload and the internal pressure are treated as quasi-static loads so that the finite element method with explicit numerical integration scheme based on the theory of wave propagation can be applied. The dynamic impacts with short durations such as the 30 -foot drop and the 40 -inch puncture for the hypothetical accident conditions specified in 10 CFR 71 are also analyzed by using the finite-element method with explicit numerical integration scheme...|$|E

30|$|Compared to Fig.  62 a, b {{shows that}} with the {{increase}} of the cable’s prestress, there is a significant increase of prestress spread in the area along the cable length in the roadway’s top coal and perpendicular to the direction of cable length. Nevertheless, in terms of the compressive stress in coal body formed by the bolt and cable’s prestress, under the impact of the increase of cable’s prestress and the superposition effect of the bolt’s prestress, the maximum compressive stress close to the cable in the coal body reaches 0.88  MPa. When the <b>bolt’s</b> <b>tightening</b> torque is 200, and 300  N m, the distribution of compressive stress formed in the coal body by cables and bolts is not uniform, the compressible stress between two bolts farther away from cables is 0.48  MPa. When the <b>bolt’s</b> <b>tightening</b> torque is 400  N m, the effect of prestress spread formed in top coal by cables and bolts is improved to some extent. The compressible stress between two bolts farther away from cables is approximately 0.64  MPa.|$|R

This ever finer clarification of waste is key to establishing distinctions between value-adding activity, waste and non-value-adding work. Non-value adding work is waste that must be done under the present work conditions.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, the prestress of rock bolts {{is one of}} the key {{parameters for}} bolting, and plays a decisive role on the effect of anchor support. The previous studies show that the anchor prestress should reach a level of 30  %– 50  % of anchor yield strength. According to the conversion relationship, the bolts’ tightening torque should be 300 – 500  N m. To reach such a high prestress, the existing single bolting machines in China cannot meet such a requirement. It is necessary to develop a suitable <b>bolt</b> <b>tightening</b> tool to significantly increase the anchor cable’s prestress.|$|E

50|$|This {{self-locking}} {{property is}} {{one reason for the}} very large use of the screw in threaded fasteners such as wood screws, sheet metal screws, studs and <b>bolts.</b> <b>Tightening</b> the fastener by turning it puts compression force on the materials or parts being fastened together, but no amount of force from the parts will cause the screw to untighten.
