A location that Cole had stayed after leaving PDAP was traced by her grandmother in Kalamazoo to a home in Shreveport, Louisiana. Her grandmother called the residence where she was informed that Cole had departed to attend a party <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> returned.

Cole had been previously excluded as a possible identity of the victim by a medical examiner for unknown reasons.|$|E
25|$|Ambre had sung Carmen in the Netherlands {{early in}} her career and during the 1879–1880 Mapleson tour, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> sung it in France. The opera had not been seen in Paris since its world premiere at the Opéra-Comique in 1875, {{although}} it had several subsequent stagings in the French provinces. Keen to perform it in Paris, she asked Manet to write his friend Antonin Proust and urge him to pressure the Opéra-Comique to revive it for her. A Paris revival with Ambre never happened, but she did sing the role again on her 1880–1881 American tour. Scholars differ {{as to whether the}} portrait was done at Ambre's request or as a thank-you gesture from Manet for having organized the exhibition of The Execution of Emperor Maximilian the previous year. During the late summer of 1880 Manet wrote to Eva Gonzalès that he would be working on the painting every day as Ambre was leaving for America that October. However, the portrait remained in the artist's possession. It was in the inventory of works inherited by Manet's widow Suzanne on his death in 1883.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the death}} of their grandson, Les and Pam confess their {{blackmail}} secret to their friend, Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), who warns Babe to end the blackmail. However, despite Claudette's warnings, Babe continues to blackmail the Cokers. This sparks tension between Babe and Claudette, who tells Babe that she will be moving back to the square to keep a [...] "closer eye" [...] on her. Badland explained Babe's rivalry with Claudette: [...] "Claudette's sticking up for Les and Pam. She's a fair match for Babe and it's interesting when they go head-to-head." [...] Badland hoped that the feud would last a long time, opining that it was [...] "fabulous", and that [...] "neither [...] will back down easily", and adding that she thought Babe would triumph over Claudette, though admitted she was biased and probably [...] "the only person on Babe's side". An Inside Soap reporter said Babe and Claudette's feud was [...] "exciting" [...] because Claudette is [...] "fearsome" [...] and Babe is [...] "equally terrifying", and suspected that [...] "Cunning Babe [...] be so easily intimidated". A reporter for All About Soap questioned if Babe had [...] "finally met her match" [...] in Claudette, and compared the two women. In terms of cunning, they said that Babe has it [...] "by the bucketload", while Claudette may be [...] "getting soft in her old age" [...] and may not be [...] "sharp enough to take on Babe". They also opined that Claudette had more [...] "fighting strenth" [...] as she continues to come back after a [...] "knock down" [...] and would not go down without a fight, while Babe's craftiness [...] "means she'd easily {{come up with a new}} way to destroy an enemy". They said that Claudette has a [...] "nasty and murderous" [...] history while Babe's past is [...] "chequered" [...] <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> killed someone, concluding that Claudette would be the winner of the feud, but still saying that they [...] "wouldn't mess with Babe!".|$|E
2500|$|On 16 March 1969, {{five years}} and twelve days after she left her husband, gravely ill, Meena Kumari {{reported}} for work again on Pakeezah. Kamal Amrohi organized a great reception. He gave his wife a peda (sweet) as a peace offering and made a documentary film on her arrival at the studio. Meena Kumari was determined to complete the film and, {{well aware of the}} limited time left for her to live, went {{out of her way to}} complete it at the earliest. Despite her rapidly deteriorating health, she gave the finishing touches to her performance. Vinod Mehta (writer of Meena Kumari - The Classic Biography) shared an incident which occurred during the last days of the shooting of Pakeezah: [...] "On outdoor shooting Kamal Amrohi's unit travelled in two cars near a place called Shivpuri in Madhya Pradesh, the cars all but ran out of petrol, and for miles around there was nothing except a long, deserted, straight road. It was discovered that a bus passed on this route every morning from which fuel could be purchased. Kamal Amrohi decided to spend the night in the desert; he ordered his unit to roll up the windows of the cars and hope for the best. A little after midnight the occupants of the vehicles were surrounded by a dozen armed men. The men knocked on the closed windows and forced their way in. When the armed gang leader learned that one of the people in the car was Meena Kumari, his attitude completely changed. He turned out to be a Meena Kumari fan, and welcomed his guests in true fan tradition. He organized music, dancing, and food. He provided a place to sleep. He instructed his juniors the next morning to fetch petrol for the unit. From Meena Kumari, he wanted a special favor. He sharpened his knife and took it to her. [...] "Please autograph my hand with this", he requested. Meena was not new to signing autographs <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> attempted anything as ambitious as a knife. Nervously, she wrote her name on this man's hand. He said he was grateful for this favor. Once the unit left, they found at the next town that they had spent the night in the camp of Madhya Pradesh's renowned and dangerous dacoit - Amrit Lal." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{coaching}} progressed rapidly. At {{first it}} had been slow, but later a sudden acceleration had manifested itself. This began from the moment Madeline tried on the white-satin slippers, {{and in so doing}} found herself. The pride of her renegade father, apart from any natural self-esteem she might possess, at that instant received its birth. Hitherto, she had deemed herself a woman of an alien breed, of inferior stock, purchased by her lord's favor. Her husband had seemed to her a god, who had lifted her, through no essential virtues on her part, to his own godlike level. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> forgotten, even when Young Cal was born, that she was not of his people.
