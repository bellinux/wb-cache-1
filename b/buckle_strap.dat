5000|$|The kung fu shoe, {{also known}} as a [...] "Tai Chi shoe" [...] or as a [...] "martial arts slipper", is a type and style of cloth slip-on shoe that is {{traditionally}} made in China, and was originally worn while practicing kung fu and other martial arts, and also while performing Tai Chi. Variants of this shoe are now mass-produced for general-purpose wear, and there are several slightly different styles. These shoes are inexpensive and are available worldwide.One common kind is cheaply produced and is typically black, with minimal lining; it has a low-sided cloth upper, and a pale brown hard plastic sole. One variant is made as a lace-up shoe rather than a slip-on shoe. A version of the shoe for girls and women has a <b>buckle</b> <b>strap</b> and resembles the Mary Jane shoe. Some varieties of the kung fu shoe have reinforced cotton soles instead of plastic ones, and some have rubber soles.|$|E

50|$|The {{official}} {{emblem of}} the Parliament is a crowned circlet featuring the Coat of Arms of New South Wales taking {{the form of a}} Scottish crest badge. Crest badges, much like clan tartans, do not have a long history, and owe much to Victorian era romanticism, having only been worn on the bonnet since the mid-19th century when the <b>buckled</b> <b>strap</b> device commonly used by the Order of the Garter was adopted as a popular design to encircle monogram escutcheons and heraldic crests.|$|R

50|$|Reichhart {{sought to}} reduce the time taken during an {{execution}} {{and to make the}} suffering of the condemned as short as possible. In view of this aim, he was instrumental in removing the tilting body board of the Fallbeil and relying on a fixed bench to which the condemned were physically restrained by two or three assistant executioners, thus removing the time-consuming act of <b>buckling</b> <b>straps</b> around the condemned's body. This shortened the elapsed time of the decapitation to only three or four seconds.|$|R
50|$|The effigy of Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick in the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick, {{show how}} 15th century Italian-style sabatons {{would have been}} worn. These consist of a toe cap, four {{articulated}} lames, a foot plate and ankle plate, and a hinged heel cap, joined with <b>buckled</b> <b>straps.</b> Although the spurs are missing from the effigy, remains of rivet holes and staples may represent {{the way that the}} spurs would have been directly attached to the heel cap of the sabaton, rather than being strapped on afterwards.|$|R

25|$|With modern strap bindings, {{the rider}} wears a boot {{which has a}} thick but {{flexible}} sole, and padded uppers. The foot is held onto the board with two <b>buckle</b> <b>straps</b> – one strapped {{across the top of}} the toe area, and one across the ankle area. They can be tightly ratcheted closed for a tight fit and good rider control of the board. Straps are typically padded to more evenly distribute pressure across the foot. While nowhere near as popular as two-strap bindings, some people prefer three-strap bindings for more specialized riding such as carving. The third strap tends to provide additional stiffness to the binding.|$|R
50|$|This <b>buckled</b> <b>strap</b> {{was later}} {{replaced}} by a metal cable. The cable binding remained in use, and even increased in popularity, throughout this period as cross-country skiing developed into a major sport of its own. Change eventually came though {{the evolution of the}} Rottefella binding, first introduced in 1927. The original Rottefella eliminated the heel strap, which held the boot forward in the binding, by drilling small holes in the sole of the boot which fit into pins in the toe piece. This was standardized as the 3-pin system, which was widespread by the 1970s. It has now generally been replaced by the NNN system.|$|R

5000|$|The bag has a {{lock and}} keys. The keys are {{enclosed}} {{in a leather}} lanyard known as a clochette, carried by looping it through a handle. The bag is locked by closing the top flaps over buckle loops, wrapping the <b>buckle</b> <b>straps,</b> or closing the lock on the front hardware. Locks and keys are number-coded. Early locks only bore one number {{on the bottom of}} the lock. In more recent years, Hermès has added a second number under the Hermes stamp of the lock. The numbers for locks may be the same for hundreds of locks, as they are batch numbers in which the locks were made.|$|R
