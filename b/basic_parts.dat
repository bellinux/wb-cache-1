25|$|NIMs are {{constructed}} of periodic <b>basic</b> <b>parts</b> called unit cells, {{which are usually}} significantly smaller than the wavelength of the externally applied electromagnetic radiation. The unit cells of the first experimentally investigated NIMs were constructed from circuit board material, or in other words, wires and dielectrics. And in general, these artificially constructed cells are stacked or planar and configured in a particular repeated pattern to compose the individual NIM. For instance, the unit cells of the first NIMs were stacked horizontally and vertically, resulting in a pattern that was repeated and intended (see below images).|$|E

25|$|Primal {{therapy is}} a trauma-based {{psychotherapy}} created by Arthur Janov, who argues that neurosis {{is caused by}} the repressed pain of childhood trauma. Janov argues that repressed pain can be sequentially brought to conscious awareness and resolved through re-experiencing specific incidents and fully expressing the resulting pain during therapy. In therapy, the patient recalls and reenacts a particularly disturbing past experience usually occurring early in life and expresses normally repressed anger or frustration especially through spontaneous and unrestrained screams, hysteria, or violence. Primal therapy was developed as a means of eliciting the repressed pain; the term Pain is capitalized in discussions of primal therapy when referring to any repressed emotional distress and its purported long-lasting psychological effects. Janov criticizes the talking therapies as they deal primarily with the cerebral cortex and higher-reasoning areas and do not access the source of Pain within the more <b>basic</b> <b>parts</b> of the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|The {{intent to}} allow all {{developers}} to have artistic freedom {{with the game}} created some internal strife in the team, particularly in the level design; they had initially scoped that level designers would create the <b>basic</b> <b>parts</b> of a level - main paths, scripted events, and the level's general design, while the artists would build out the world from that. As development progressed, they determined that the artists should be the ones constructing the level geometry, which the level designers resented. Subsequently, levels that were generated were not to the expected standards due to conflicts in the toolsets they used and Schafer's inability to oversee the process while handling the other duties of the studio. In 2003, {{the decision was made}} to dismiss all but one of the level design team, and unify the level design and art into a World Building team overseen by Erik Robson, the remaining level designer and who would go on to become the game's lead designer; the change, which Esmurdoc stated was for the better, disrupted the other departments at Double Fine.|$|E

500|$|Miller {{described}} his biggest challenge in writing Rivens music as reconciling the linear, pleasing construction of music with the nonlinearity of the gameplay. As players can freely explore all areas, Miller explained in an interview, [...] "the music can't say anything too specific. If it says something, if it builds in intensity and there starts to be a climax, {{and people are}} just standing in a room looking around, and they're thinking 'What's going on in here? Is something about to jump out from behind me?' You can't have the <b>basic</b> <b>parts</b> of music that you'd like to have, you can't have a basic structure. It's all got to be just flowing, and continue to flow." [...] Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine argued that the soundtrack is [...] "appealingly atmospheric", but [...] "lacks definition", and that the music loses impact when separated from the game.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{character of}} Gerda, known as Anna, {{was one of}} the three major characters in the script at this time, along with the Snow Queen, Elsa and Kristoff, loosely based on Kay. The characters were not considered to be well-rounded or relatable, but an interpersonal, family dynamic was created once Anna and Elsa were established as sisters, an idea suggested by someone on the writing team that no one remembered who. This changed the story dramatically, shifting from the conflict between the good and the evil to the conflict between love and fear. Buck stated that their script still retained <b>basic</b> <b>parts</b> of the story and the character of Gerda, citing the similarities between the original story and his version, [...] " [...] won't give up on finding her friend Kai. The only thing she really has in her, she's not a superhero or anything, but she has love. And it's love that conquers fear in the end." ...|$|E

500|$|The DB9 {{has been}} adapted {{for use in}} sports car racing by Aston Martin Racing, a {{collaboration}} between Aston Martin and Prodrive. Called the DBR9, the car debuted in 2005. It retains the DB9's 5.9 L V12 engine <b>basic</b> <b>parts,</b> but the car has been extensively modified to decrease its weight {{as well as to}} improve performance. Most of the car's aluminium body panels have been replaced with carbon fibre panels, and several external features, like a front splitter and a rear wing, have been added to increase the car's downforce. Inside, the DB9's interior has mostly been scrapped to save weight. Likewise, though the suspension's layout remains the same, it has been improved to racing specifications. The brakes are upgraded to Brembo carbon-carbon disks and six-piston calipers. The transmission in the DBR9 is a Xtrac six-speed sequential manual, containing a Salisbury friction-plate limited-slip differential, and the prop shaft is also made of carbon fibre. The engine modifications allow the car to develop [...] and [...] of torque; that power, in addition to the lost weight, allows the DBR9 can go from 0 to [...] in 6.4 seconds.|$|E
500|$|By 1996, Dre {{was again}} looking to {{innovate}} his sound. He recruited keyboardist Camara Kambon {{to play the}} keys on [...] "Been There, Done That", and through Bud'da and Sam Sneed he was introduced to fellow Pittsburgh native Melvin [...] "Mel-Man" [...] Bradford. At this time, he also switched from using the E-mu SP-1200 to the Akai MPC3000 drum kit and sampler, which he still uses today. Beginning with his 1996 compilation Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath, Dre's production has taken a less sample-based approach, with loud, layered snare drums dominating the mix, while synthesizers are still omnipresent. In his critically acclaimed sophomore effort, 2001, live instrumentation {{takes the place of}} sampling, a famous example being [...] "The Next Episode", in which keyboardist Camara Kambon re-played live the main melody from David McCallum's 1967 jazz-funk work [...] "The Edge". For every song on 2001, Dre had a keyboardist, guitarist and bassist create the <b>basic</b> <b>parts</b> of the beat, while he himself programmed the drums, did the sequencing and overdubbing and added sound effects, and later mixed the songs. During this period, Dre's signature [...] "west coast whistle" [...] riffs are still present albeit in a lower pitch, as in [...] "Light Speed", [...] "Housewife", [...] "Some L.A. Niggaz" [...] and Eminem's [...] "Guilty Conscience" [...] hook. The sound of [...] "2001" [...] had tremendous influence on hip-hop production, redefining the West Coast's sound and expanding the G-funk of the early 1990s. To produce the album, Dre and Mel-Man relied on the talents of Scott Storch and Camara Kambon on the keys, Mike Elizondo and Colin Wolfe on bass guitar, Sean Cruse on lead guitar and sound engineers Richard [...] "Segal" [...] Huredia and Mauricio [...] "Veto" [...] Iragorri.|$|E
