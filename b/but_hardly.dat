5|$|In 1877 three {{stones were}} found in a cavern on Rodrigues, each near a Rodrigues {{solitaire}} skeleton, and were inferred to be the gizzard stones mentioned by Leguat. One of the stones was examined and found to be dolerite: somewhat rough, hard and heavy, , <b>but</b> <b>hardly</b> flat on one side as described by Leguat. This {{could be due to}} its association with a young individual. Although Leguat asserted that the bird hatched with the gizzard stone already inside, in reality adults most likely fed the stones to their hatchlings.|$|E
5|$|The south transept's {{southern}} wall {{is nearly}} complete, displaying the fine workmanship {{of the first}} phase. It shows the Gothic pointed arch style in the windows that first appeared in France in the mid-12th century and was apparent in England around 1170, <b>but</b> <b>hardly</b> appeared in Scotland until the early 13th century. It also shows the round early Norman window design that continued {{to be used in}} Scotland during the entire Gothic period (Fig. 6). The windows and the quoins are of finely cut ashlar sandstone. A doorway in the south-west portion of the wall has large mouldings and has a pointed oval window placed above it. Adjacent to the doorway are two lancet-arched windows that are topped at the clerestory level with three round-headed windows. The north transept has much less of its structure preserved, but much of what does remain, taken together with a study by John Slezer in 1693, shows that it was similar to the south transept, except that the north transept had no external door and featured a stone turret containing a staircase.|$|E
25|$|In Eastern Europe, houses include sunken-floored dwellings, surface dwellings, and stall-houses. The largest known {{settlement}} is the Criuleni District. Chernyakhov cemeteries feature both cremation and inhumation burials; {{among the latter}} the head is to the north. Some graves were left empty. Grave goods often include pottery, bone combs, and iron tools, <b>but</b> <b>hardly</b> ever weapons.|$|E

25|$|Hagley Oval is a cricket ground {{located in}} Hagley Park {{in the central}} city of Christchurch, New Zealand.

In {{the case of}} an information good, however, because of its characteristics of non-excludability and also because of almost zero reproduction costs, commoditization is difficult and not always efficient even from a neoclassical economic point of view.|$|E
25|$|South Jutlandic {{is still}} spoken {{to some degree}} in villages up to about 15km south of the Danish-German border, <b>but</b> <b>hardly</b> in the major city of Flensburg, where the Danish {{speakers}} speak Standard Danish. Most {{people will be able}} to speak or understand Low German and sometimes North Frisian. All will know High German, often being the only language of young people and children. Members of the Danish minority are taught Standard Danish as well in schools, but often choose to communicate in German in everyday life.|$|E

25|$|Various metres {{are used}} in the plays. As far as is known, the iambic senarii were spoken without music; trochaic septenarii (and also iambic septenarii and trochaic and iambic octonarii) were chanted or recited (or {{possibly}} sung) to the sound of a pair of pipes known as tībiae (the equivalent of the Greek aulos), played by a tībīcen ("piper"); and other metres were sung, possibly in an operatic style, to the same tibiae. In Plautus about 37% of lines are unaccompanied iambic senarii, but in Terence {{more than half of the}} verses are senarii. Plautus's plays therefore had a greater amount of musical accompaniment than Terence's. Another difference between the playwrights was that polymetric songs (using metres other than iambic and trochaic) are frequent in Plautus (about 14% of the plays), <b>but</b> <b>hardly</b> used at all by Terence.|$|E
25|$|Two black-figure vase {{painters}} {{are considered}} to be mannerists (540-520 BC). The painter Elbows Out decorated primarily Little Masters cups. The extended elbows of his figures are conspicuous, a characteristic responsible for his pragmatic name. He only seldom depicted mythological scenes; erotic scenes are much more common. He also decorated a rare vase form known as a lydion. The most important of the two painters was The Affecter, whose name comes from the exaggeratedly artificial impression made by his figures. These small-headed figures {{do not seem to be}} acting as much as posing. His early work shows scenes of daily life; later he turned to decorative scenes in which figures and attributes are recognizable, <b>but</b> <b>hardly</b> actions. If his figures are clothed they look as if they were padded; if they are naked they are very angular. The Affecter was both potter and painter; over 130 of his vases have survived.|$|E
25|$|The 16th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (16th Northumberland) and the 15th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers (15th Lancashire) {{leading the}} 96th Brigade attack, {{were shot down}} {{immediately}} the attack began by the machine-gunners in Thiepval. The 16th Lancashire in support moved forward to the vacant front trenches as the attack began and the 2nd Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers (2nd Inniskilling) were in reserve in the valley. The 16th Northumberland attacked towards the south and centre of Thiepval <b>but</b> <b>hardly</b> advanced from the front line, before lines of troops were mown down and attempts to get forward by short rushes were also checked by continuous machine-gun fire. The effect of the German machine-guns, gave the German infantry time to emerge from shelter and some climbed onto the trench parapet {{to get a better}} view of the attackers and engage them with rifle fire. The last company of the 16th Northumberland, mounted the fire step of the British front trench to return fire against the German soldiers visible opposite.|$|E

25|$|Not {{that winning}} {{the race was}} easy. For this race the ABA {{abandoned}} its own commitment to the transfer system and not only had the Pros run the qualifying rounds in the cumulative scoring manner, i.e. racing {{three times in the}} qualifying motos and the pros with the eight lowest point scores transfer to the Main, but the Main was also cumulative, but not merely run three times but five. This greatly reduced the luck factor and awarded the most consistent. However what grated against the pros' nerves that basically just one race was deciding the number one pro for the year. Brian Patterson eventually one the car and the plate (and also winning the conventional pro AA Main and Pro Open as well), <b>but</b> <b>hardly</b> any pros thought it was fair, least of all Greg Hill and not even the winner, Brian Patterson. By any account it was an exciting race for the season championship.|$|E
25|$|The {{wall of the}} mihrab {{is covered}} with 28 panels of white marble, carved and pierced, which have {{a wide variety of}} plant and {{geometric}} patterns including the stylized grape leaf, the flower and the shell. Behind the openwork hint, there is an oldest niche on which several assumptions were formulated. If one refers to the story of Al-Bakri, an Andalusian historian and geographer of the eleventh century, it is the mihrab which would be done by Uqba Ibn Nafi, the founder of Kairouan, whereas Lucien Golvin shares the view that it is not an old mihrab <b>but</b> <b>hardly</b> a begun construction which may serve to support marble panels and either goes back to work of Ziadet Allah I (817-838) or to those of Abul Ibrahim around the years 862-863. Above the marble cladding, the mihrab niche is crowned with a half dome-shaped vault made of manchineel bentwood. Covered with a thick coating completely painted, the concavity of the arch is decorated with intertwined scrolls enveloping stylized five-lobed vine leaves, three-lobed florets and sharp clusters, all in yellow on midnight blue background.|$|E
25|$|In June 1674, Turenne won {{the battle}} of Sinzheim, which made him master of the Electorate of the Palatinate. Under orders from Paris the French wasted the country far and wide, and this devastation with the sack of Türckheim usually counts as the gravest blot on Turenne's fame. In the autumn the anti-French allies again advanced, and though they again outmanoeuvered Turenne, {{the action of the}} neutral city of Strasbourg occasioned his failure by {{permitting}} the enemy to cross the Rhine by the bridge at that place. The battle of Enzheim followed; this proved a tactical victory, <b>but</b> <b>hardly</b> affected the situation, and, at the beginning of December, the allies remained in Alsace. The old marshal now made the most daring campaign of his career. A swift and secret march in mid-winter {{from one end of the}} Vosges to the other took the allies by surprise. Sharply following up his first successes, Turenne drove the enemy to Turkheim, and there inflicted upon them a heavy defeat (5 January 1675). As revenge for the active resistance the inhabitants of the city had shown, Turenne let his troops loot it and massacre the remaining population during two weeks. In a few weeks he had completely recovered Alsace.|$|E

25|$|Reductions {{were laid}} out {{according}} to a standardised plan: the main buildings, like the church, college and churchyard were concentrated around a wide square, with houses facing the other three sides. Each village also provided a house for widows, a hospital, and several warehouses. In {{the centre of the}} square there was a cross and a statue of the mission's patron saint. The reductions were ruled by indigenous chiefs who served as the reductions' governors, but were controlled by the Jesuits. There was a minimum of two Jesuits in a reduction, with more for larger ones. The social organization of the reductions has often been described as extremely efficient; most were self-supporting and even produced surpluses of goods, which they traded to outside communities, which laid the foundation of the belief that Jesuits were guarding immense riches acquired through Indian labour. The main traded produce was the hides of their cattle and yerba mate, leaves drunk somewhat like tea. Initially these were collected from the wild, but later cultivated. A number of trades and skills were taught to some Indians, including even printing to produce mostly religious texts in indigenous languages, some illustrated by engravings by indigenous artists. In reality the communities were economically successful <b>but</b> <b>hardly</b> constituted any important source of income for the Jesuit order. The degree to which the Jesuits controlled the indigenous population for which they had responsibility {{and the degree to which}} they allowed indigenous culture to function is a matter of debate.|$|E

500|$|Though Parsons was {{a lifelong}} devotee to Thelema, he grew weary of and {{eventually}} left the Ordo Templi Orientis—the religious organization that began propagating Thelema under Crowley's {{leadership from the}} 1910s—which Parsons viewed, despite the disagreement of Crowley himself, as excessively hierarchical and impeding upon the rigorous spiritual and philosophical practice of True Will, describing the O.T.O. as [...] "an excellent training school for adepts, <b>but</b> <b>hardly</b> an appropriate Order for the manifestation of Thelema". In this sense Parsons was described by Carter as an [...] "almost fundamentalist" [...] Thelemite who placed The Book of the Laws dogma above all other doctrine.|$|E
