40|$|The article {{examines}} the methods of assessing fiscal potential. The purpose of research is analysis, comparison and determination of the most optimal method for calculating the indicator potential of the region. Based on the method of objective, economic and statistical analysis of the study, the authors suggests their own method of calculating the tax potential, and compare the obtained results of existing and proposed assessment methods. The methods of system analysis, structuring, modeling and graphic comparisons allowed to identify the factors that affect the tax potential and its dependence on the socio-economic status of a subject of the Russian Federation. Each region of the Russian Federation, including the Volgograd and Rostov regions represents an isolated unit of the national economy, which solves its main task – managing the regional budget. Federal and regional budget {{is based on the}} interaction of the system of inter-budgetary relations. At the same time, all Russian regions are heterogeneous in terms of economic development, climatic conditions, the level of resourcesufficiency and financial resources. For uniform development of all regions of Russia made equalization of <b>budgetary</b> <b>security</b> of subjects of the Russian Federation due to transfers, subsidies and gratuitous receipts is carried out. The study proposes to use the indicator of tax capacity as an objective indicator for the allocation of financial resources. The urgency of the problem is determined by to the lack of uniform methods of calculating index tax potential in Russian regions and, as a consequence, large financial gaps in the distribution of the proceeds of grants from the federal budget to the budgets of regions. The result of the study is to confirm the effectiveness of using the potential of the method of calculation proposed by the authors, as well as comparative analysis of the methods of calculation proposed measures to optimize the calculation of this indicator. Results of the study can find its application in the development of strategies and methods of distribution of transfers and subsidies from the Federal Fund for Financial Support of Russian subjects for alignment of <b>budgetary</b> <b>security...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{approach}} to the assessment of <b>budgetary</b> <b>security</b> of RF subject {{with the use of}} per capita income of the consolidated budget. This approach is an alternative to the currently used official method of spatial distribution of the resources of the Federal Fund for financial assistance to the regions. The need to develop a new approach is caused by attempts to: simplify the existing methods in terms of reducing the dimension of the array of input data, some of which are not publicly available; increase the objectivity of the individual methods steps (with the exception of expert assessments); leveling necessary operating abstract dimensionless parameters (level of budgetary provision, the tax potential index of budgetary expenditures index). Using the proposed approach assesses the impact of options for allocating federal subsidies to the budgets of RF subjects on the dynamics of inter-regional disparities in terms of "fiscal capacity" and the growth of the Russian economy in 2012 - 2014. Option fair distribution of federal subsidies involves their direction in the regions; fiscal capacity does not exceed the minimum criteria. Option efficient allocation of grants, as opposed to the previous version, suggests the direction of federal funds to the regions, fiscal capacity exceeds the minimum criteria. Both options are compared to the actual distribution of federal subsidies, carried out according to the official procedure. Quantitative analysis of spatial distribution of government subsidies on the dynamics of regional inequality is based on two indicators: per capita income of the consolidated budget of the subject of the Russian Federation and the average per capita difference between revenues and expenditures of the RF consolidated budget of the subject. Study on economic dynamics of the Russian Federation implies a regression analysis on the basis of which it is possible to obtain new values of the gross regional product of the RF subjects in different variants of the spatial distribution of federal grants. The resulting research estimates show that the considered options for the distribution of subsidies to regional budgets are conflicting in terms of priorities of state policy choice: equality of per capita <b>budgetary</b> <b>security</b> of subjects of the Russian Federation or the accelerated growth of the national economy...|$|E
40|$|Urban districts {{occupy a}} special place in the system of {{municipalities}} due to their potential and role in the implementation of governmental economic policy. Possessing the most developed infrastructure, facilities and a good financial basis, large and medium-sized cities accumulate the major part of budget revenues. However, the predominant part of their revenues that amounts, according to various estimates, to 70 – 85 % [1, 6, 15] goes to superior budgets. As a consequence of the reforms of intergovernmental fiscal relations and local government that were held in 2000 – 2009, cities were left without stable, legislated fiscal revenue sources that were sufficient to fulfill their obligations to the population. Currently, city government can fully dispose of single tax on imputed income, individual property tax and land tax. Significant imbalances in the distribution of budget revenues make cities dependent on the financial assistance of higher levels of public authority and lead to an accumulation of problems. The Federal Treasury data on the execution of urban districts budgets show the stagnation of own revenues in 2011 – 2014. According to the calculations made by ISEDT RAS, in 2014, the availability of own budget revenues per capita was below the average value in 60 % of the capital cities of Russia’s constituent entities (regardless of Moscow and Saint Petersburg). This affected even major centers like Voronezh, Volgograd, Ufa, Chelyabinsk and Omsk. In the Vologda Oblast, the fiscal capacity of residents in urban districts that include the cities of Vologda and Cherepovets was 17 % below the national average due to the reduction in the amount of receipts of own budget sources since 2012. In the conditions of acute shortage of financial resources to meet the growing obligations to support citizens, local authorities are forced to make borrowings; this fact limits the possibility of conducting a responsible fiscal policy and implementation of strategic investment projects. The paper presents the results of the analysis of execution of the budgets of the Vologda Oblast municipal districts. The main objective of the analysis was to identify the factors that reduce the self-sufficiency of urban districts in relation to intergovernmental fiscal policy at the regional level. The main conclusion of the research consists {{in the fact that the}} actual state of city budgets reflects the lack of economic ties between <b>budgetary</b> <b>security</b> of cities and the efficiency of their economie...|$|E

After April 1796, the military was paid in metallic value, not the worthless paper, but pay was still well in arrears. The French Directory believed that war should pay for itself and did not budget to pay, feed, and equip its troops. Thus, a campaign that would take the army out of France became increasingly urgent for both <b>budgetary</b> and internal <b>security</b> reasons.|$|R

The article attempts to answer two questions. First, how can the budget of the security sector be allocated so as to result in effective and efficient security outcomes?

A modified version of Todaro's distributive share index of social welfare is used to quantify the impacts on the growth of primary budget expenditures of Security, Education, Health, General Administration, Infrastructure, and Social Services. We find that defence expenditures dominate overall security expenditures and are less affected in times of bottlenecks in the economy. A systematic pattern of negative <b>budgetary</b> trade-offs of <b>security</b> expenditures in terms of other components is not identified.

40|$|Abstract. Nigeria {{is one of}} the {{relatively}} secured nations in West African sub-region. In recent times, this endowed nation suddenly metamorphosed into an abode of serial bombing, hostage taking, armed robbery, cold-blooded killings and ethno-religious conflicts traceable to militant groups with conflicting ideological, political and religious agenda. Among these militant groups are Niger-Delta insurgents, Campus cults, Bakassi Boys, Armed robbers, O‟odua People‟s Congress, Boko Haram et cetera. The resultant loss of lives, rising <b>budgetary</b> spending for <b>security</b> and destruction of valuable government facilities portend devastating consequences for sustainable economic development in the country. This paper examines the link between national security and sustainable economic development in Nigeria. The authors adopt quantitative method, which entails extraction of secondary data from the publications of Central Bank of Nigeria, National Bureau of Statistics and other reliable reports on the subject. The generated data were carefully analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics on the basis of which far-reaching conclusions were drawn. The research findings indicate that Nigeria‟s expenditure on national security is rising faster than spending on education, agriculture, health and construction. This unpleasant finding has negative effect on sustainable economic development in Nigeria. The paper proffers tripartite...|$|R
40|$|Globally, {{there is}} no lack of {{security}} threats. Many of them demand priority engagement and there can never be adequate resources to address all threats. In this context, climate is just another aspect of global security and the Arctic just another region. In light of physical and <b>budgetary</b> constraints, new <b>security</b> needs must be integrated and prioritized with existing ones. This discussion approaches the security impacts of climate from that perspective, starting with the broad security picture and establishing how climate may affect it. This method provides a different view from one that starts with climate and projects it, in isolation, {{as the source of}} a hypothetical security burden. That said, the Arctic does appear to present high-priority security challenges. Uncertainty in the timing of an ice-free Arctic affects how quickly it will become a security priority. Uncertainty in the emergent extreme and variable weather conditions will determine the difficulty (cost) of maintaining adequate security (order) in the area. The resolution of sovereignty boundaries affects the ability to enforce security measures, and the U. S. will most probably need a military presence to back-up negotiated sovereignty agreements. Without additional global warming, technology already allows the Arctic to become a strategic link in the global supply chain, possibly with northern Russia as its main hub. Additionally, the multinational corporations reaping the economic bounty may affect security tensions more than nation-states themselves. Countries will depend ever more heavily on the global supply chains. China has particular needs to protect its trade flows. In matters of security, nation-state and multinational-corporate interests will become heavily intertwined...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the merits of}} the British budget management system that was inherited in Anglophone African countries and which has changed substantially in the United Kingdom since the 1960 s. It considers whether the disappointing budgetary performance in Africa is due to weaknesses in the inherited British system, other external influences, or domestic developments. It finds that all three factors {{have played a role in}} the widespread problems with budget management systems. Reforms in institutional arrangements are needed, especially in budget execution. Technical reforms will be ineffective unless there are concomitant changes to enhance accountability, improve governance, and increase compliance.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the correlation}} between social security budget and the main macroeconomic indicators (like GDP, monthly average gross earnings, unemployment) in Romania during the period 2000 – 2009. Romania faces a more severe economic recession than originally anticipated. Although the implementation of anti-crisis program was able to lead to normalization of financial conditions, the contraction of economic activity is higher than initial projections. Because of the great policy debate in Romania {{about the impact of}} the reduction of pensions and salaries and increases of taxations on the reduction of budget deficit, we have explained in our paper the basic sides of the balanced budget debate. There are three basic sides to the balanced budget debate. The traditionalists argue for a reduction of the budget deficit since it harms the economy. Another group holds the Ricardian view of government debt in believing that there is no real harm done to the economy by the national debt. A third group claims one way or another that the budget deficit is not an adequate measure of fiscal policy. We will argue which of these views is most reasonable, based on a study case. � � The study is based on official data published by the National Institute of Statistics, with the specification that they are transformed into real values in order to assure the data comparability. The methodology used is the correlation analysis, the factorial analysis and the regression analysis, in order to evaluate the impact of some macroeconomic policies on the budget deficit. Three hypotheses on macroeconomic policies are discussed in the paper and their influences on the budget deficit. The main problem in Romania was that the macroeconomic policies didn't give enough attention to budget deficit in order to keep it under control. This is the main cause of the actual unfavourable economical situation in Romania, with a huge budget deficit, with a decrease in economic activity, with increases of inflation and unemployment. � � Among the variables used in the study we mention: total incomes, total expenditure, budgetary deficit, unemployment rate, monthly average net earnings, average number of pensioners and social allowance recipients, monthly average pension of pensioners and social allowance recipients, economically active population, monthly average inflation rate. � � By analysing {{the correlation between}} all the studied variables we observe that there is a strong correlation between monthly average pension and monthly average net earnings. Increases in the level of earnings will determine the increase of budget deficit. At first view the macroeconomic policy adopted by the actual government in Romania (the cut with 25 % of salaries in the budgetary system, VAT increase) will have as a result the decrease of budget deficit. Since the monthly average net earnings is correlated with unemployment and inflation rate, the reduction of the general level of earnings will determine the increase of unemployment and inflation. Therefore this policy should be applied with caution, taking in parallel measures to compensate its adverse effects. The impact of some of the macroeconomic policies on budget deficit is studied using two regression functions. After an econometric analysis we shall conclude about the influence of the dependent variables of these functions on the Romanian <b>budgetary</b> deficit. social <b>security</b> budget; gross domestic product; correlation coefficient; regression analysis. ...|$|R
