5|$|Philanthropenos {{remained}} at Philadelphia until 1326, possibly also 1327, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> {{that he was}} then appointed as governor of the strategically important Byzantine island of Lesbos, since he was dismissed from the same post in 1328 by Andronikos III Palaiologos.|$|E
5|$|After Aymer's {{death in}} 1324, the castle passed by {{marriage}} to Lawrence, Lord Hastings, and {{was held in}} the Hastings family until 1390, when Reginald Lord Grey de Ruthin acquired it. There are few historical records of the castle beyond this point, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> to have been abandoned in the early 14th century and by the 15th century had become ruined.|$|E
5|$|Examples of {{important}} inscriptions {{of this nature}} include treaties with local tribes and declarations of rights. The text of this inscription cannot be reconstructed from this small fragment, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> {{to talk about the}} 'fortress', an 'amicable conclusion', and someone being 'against the regime'.|$|E

5|$|Hōshō was {{slightly}} damaged {{by a single}} bomb or aerial rocket hit when the Allies attacked Kure again in July 1945. Information is scarce {{on the extent of}} the ship's involvement in the action, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> the carrier's participation was minimal, as it embarked no aircraft at the time. Hōshō was repaired within 15 days, but the termination of hostilities in September 1945 found the carrier still docked at Kure.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom {{appears to}} have passed its peak in the 14th century, encroached upon {{by the rise of}} the Benin and Igala kingdom, and later the Atlantic slave trade, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> to have {{maintained}} its authority well into the 16th century, and remnants of the eze hierarchy persisted until the establishment of Colonial Nigeria in 1911 and represents one of the traditional states within modern Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Robert's {{theology}} {{is expressed in}} his three surviving works, the Quaestiones de divina pagina, Quaestiones de epistolis Pauli, and the unfinished Sententiae. The dating of the works is problematic, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> that the first two works were composed between 1145 and 1157. The Sententiae was revised twice, probably during the 1150s and the 1160s. His works, especially the Sententiae, cover the entire subject of theology and are strictly orthodox in Christian doctrine.|$|E
50|$|He wrote a poem to Nell, {{unpublished}} {{during his}} life, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> in his Commonplace Book {{and set to}} the tune of Nellys favourite reel.|$|R
50|$|The date {{of first}} running {{is not known}} <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared,</b> and was widely used {{by a variety of}} {{aircraft}} and in several contests during 1923, with more in 1924.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} {{initially}} {{referred to as}} 'Chard Joint'. It was renamed as plain 'Chard' on 1 March 1928, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> as such in GWR timetables before that date.|$|R
5|$|The College of Design (formerly College of Architecture) {{maintains}} a small permanent presence in Paris in {{affiliation with the}} École d'architecture de Paris-La Villette and the College of Computing has a similar program with the Barcelona School of Informatics at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in Barcelona, Spain. There are additional programs in Athlone, Ireland, Shanghai, China, and Singapore. Georgia Tech was supposed set up two campuses for research and graduate education in the cities of Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad, Telangana, India by the year 2010, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> the plans have been set on hold as of 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{front part}} of a skull (specimen NMP P6V-004389, a syntype of this species) in the National Museum of Prague was found in 1850 among {{the remains of the}} Böhmisches Museum. Other {{elements}} supposedly belonging to this specimen have been listed in the literature, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> only the partial skull was ever present. It may be what remains of one of the stuffed dodos known to have been at the menagerie of Emperor Rudolph II, possibly the specimen painted by Hoefnagel or Savery there.|$|E
5|$|Wright {{resumed his}} Cambridge {{fellowship}} upon {{returning from the}} Azores in 1589, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> that he soon moved to London for he was there with Christopher Heydon making observations of the sun between 1594 and 1597, and on 8 August 1595 Wright married Ursula Warren (died 1625) at the parish church of St. Michael, Cornhill, in the City of London. They had a son, Samuel (1596–1616), who was himself admitted as a sizar at Caius on 7 July 1612. The St. Michael parish register also contains references to other children of Wright, all of whom died before 1617. Wright resigned his fellowship in 1596.|$|E

5|$|Blyton's granddaughter, Sophie Smallwood, wrote a new Noddy book to {{celebrate}} the character's 60th birthday, 46 years after the last book was published; Noddy and the Farmyard Muddle (2009) was illustrated by Robert Tyndall. In February 2011, the manuscript of a previously unknown Blyton novel, Mr Tumpy's Caravan, was discovered by the archivist at Seven Stories, National Centre for Children's Books {{in a collection of}} papers belonging to Blyton's daughter Gillian, purchased by Seven Stories in 2010 following her death. It was initially thought to belong to a comic strip collection of the same name published in 1949, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> to be unrelated and is believed to be something written in the 1930s, which had been rejected by a publisher.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Stephen's siege, Henry returned to England {{again at the}} start of 1153, braving winter storms. Bringing only a small army of mercenaries, probably paid for with borrowed money, Henry was supported in the north and east of England by the forces of Ranulf of Chester and Hugh Bigod, and had hopes of a military victory. A delegation of senior English clergy met with Henry and his advisers at Stockbridge shortly before Easter in April. Details of their discussions are unclear, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> that the churchmen emphasised that while they supported Stephen as king, they sought a negotiated peace; Henry reaffirmed that he would avoid the English cathedrals and would not expect the bishops to attend his court.|$|E
5|$|Lauren is interrogated by Mulder and Scully, {{and the two}} unknown {{agents that}} called them in, {{who say they are}} {{involved}} because they believe Graves and Dorlund's company sold technology to the Isfahan. Lauren admits to Mulder and Scully that the sales did indeed take place and that she believes Dorlund had Graves killed. After hearing Lauren recount the eerie circumstances that she believes are being caused by Graves' spirit, Scully - the usually reserved skeptic - readily accepts her story. Mulder is confused but, after Lauren leaves, Scully admits she was just humoring her. The agents search the company's premises, but are unable to find any evidence. When Dorlund attacks Lauren with a letter opener Graves' spirit takes it and cuts open the wallpaper, revealing a disc with evidence. Weeks later, Lauren starts her new job, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> that Graves' spirit may have followed her there.|$|E

50|$|Dedekind was {{the author}} of Grobianus et Grobiana: sive, de morum simplicitate, libri tres (Cologne, 1558). This work had first been {{published}} in 1549 as Grobianus, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> with additions known as Grobiana in 1554.|$|R
50|$|The {{method is}} named after Jørgen Pedersen Gram and Erhard Schmidt <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> earlier {{in the work of}} Laplace and Cauchy. In the theory of Lie group decompositions it is {{generalized}} by the Iwasawa decomposition.|$|R
5|$|Not much of Nerva's {{early life}} or career is recorded, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> {{he did not}} pursue the usual {{administrative}} or military career. He was praetor-elect in the year 65 and, like his ancestors, moved in imperial circles as a skilled diplomat and strategist. As an advisor to Emperor Nero, he successfully helped detect and expose the Pisonian conspiracy of 65. His exact contribution to the investigation is not known, but his services must have been considerable, since they earned him rewards equal to those of Nero's guard prefect Tigellinus. He received triumphal honors — which was usually reserved for military victories — {{and the right to}} have his statues placed throughout the palace.|$|E
5|$|P. canariensis, the Canary Islands {{chiffchaff}} is a non-migratory species formerly occurring on {{the major}} Canary Islands, which is differentiated from P. collybita by morphology, vocalisations and genetic characteristics, and, of course, is not sympatric with any other chiffchaffs. The nominate western subspecies P. c. canariensis of El Hierro, La Palma, La Gomera, Tenerife, and Gran Canaria is smaller than common chiffchaff, and has shorter, rounder wings. It is olive-brown above and has a buff breast and flanks; it has a rich deep chip-cheep-cheep-chip-chip-cheep song, and a call similar to the nominate race. The eastern P. c. exsul of Lanzarote and possibly Fuerteventura is paler above and less rufous below than its western relative, and had a harsher call; {{it might have been}} a distinct species, but it became extinct in 1986 at latest, probably much earlier. The reasons for its extinction are unclear, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> always to have been scarce and localised, occurring only in the Haria Valley of Lanzarote.|$|E
5|$|The {{chestnut}} sparrow {{is found}} in East Africa in mostly lower country from Darfur through Kordofan, South Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, and Kenya to north-central Tanzania. Its range also extends northeast into the southwest and Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Like the golden sparrows, it is sometimes nomadic when not breeding. Vagrants have been recorded as far from their breeding range as Dar es Salaam. It is found mostly in dry savanna and in fields and villages, but unlike its relations the golden sparrows, it is sometimes found in swamps of papyrus (certain Cyperus spp.). Its population has not been quantified, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> to be common across a very large range and it is assessed by the IUCN Red List as Least Concern for global extinction.|$|E
60|$|The small servant, perhaps {{frightened by}} his looks, {{returned}} no audible reply; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> from {{the motion of}} her lips that she was inwardly repeating the same form of expression concerning the note or message.|$|R
50|$|In {{separate}} June and July 1983 Byte articles, {{the company}} mentioned a late summer 1983 release. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> to developers {{within the company}} that a fourth-quarter release would be the earliest that could be hoped for.|$|R
6000|$|He {{had spoken}} with cheer, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> to drop before this reassurance, {{as if the}} latter overdid his alarm, {{and that should be}} corrected. [...] "Oh, my dear, I've always thought of her as a little girl." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{etymology}} of the term, “gandingan,” {{is unknown}} <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> in many Maguindanao folk tales and epics. For instance, one folk tale states the Malailai Gandingan {{is a place}} known for a powerful sultan and his beautiful daughter while in another epic, Raja sa Madaya, Gandingan is the proper name of a place where hostile datus (who attempted to abduct a princess from the prince of Madaya) live. Perhaps the most significant mention of the gandingan in an epic tale is in the Maguindanao epic Diwatakasalipan, where word “gandingan” actually refers to the instrument itself. In the epic, a young princess, Tintingan na Bulawan, uses the gandingan to inform her sister, Initulon na Gambal, about a hero prince, Diwatakasalipan, who {{was looking for a}} wife. Thanks to that message, Initulon na Gambal was able to entertain the hero prince using a kulintang into her heart. This use of the gandingan in this epic exemplifies that its use as a form of communication was pre-Islamic in origin.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no direct}} sources {{describing}} {{the conquest of}} the Chajoma by the Spanish <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> {{to have been a}} drawn-out campaign rather than a rapid victory. The only description of the conquest of the Chajoma is a secondary account appearing in the work of Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán in the 17th century, long after the event. After the conquest, the inhabitants of {{the eastern part of the}} kingdom were relocated by the conquerors to San Pedro Sacatepéquez, including some of the inhabitants of the archaeological site now known as Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo). The rest of the population of Mixco Viejo, together with the inhabitants of the western part of the kingdom, were moved to San Martín Jilotepeque. The Chajoma rebelled against the Spanish in 1526, fighting a battle at Ukub'il, an unidentified site somewhere near the modern towns of San Juan Sacatepéquez and San Pedro Sacatepéquez.|$|E
5|$|This {{model has}} Siletzia forming on the {{continental}} margin along {{what is now}} the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament (OWL; a zone of topographical features of unknown age and tectonic significance), with the southern end of Siletzia and the Klamath Mountains (joined to Siletzia) near the Idaho Batholith in central Idaho. Further evidence for this comes from the sand of the Tyee Formation that overlie the Roseburg Formation. Not only does this sand have the same isotopic composition of rock in the Idaho Batholith (and of sand now coursing down the Snake and Columbia Rivers), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> to have not been transported very far from its source. This implies that the Tyee Formation was much closer to the Idaho Batholith when it was deposited, and subsequently rotated away. Geodetic surveys show that the region continues to rotate, likely as a result of extension of the Basin and Range Province and asthenospheric flow around the southern edge of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate.|$|E
50|$|The Aeroneer 1-B is an {{all-metal}} {{light aircraft}} {{built in the}} United States in 1936. It did not reach production, despite an attempt to interest the USAAC in it as a trainer, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> in three Hollywood films.|$|R
