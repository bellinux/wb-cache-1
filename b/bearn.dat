5|$|At {{the time}} work stopped, Normandies hull was 65percent complete, her engines were 70percent complete, and her boilers were {{delivered}} but were instead installed in new destroyers. The turrets were 40percent assembled. Languedoc had 49percent of her hull and 73percent of her engines constructed; her boilers were 96percent complete and only 26percent of her turrets were built. The hulls of Flandre and Gascogne were 65 and 60percent complete, respectively, and their engines were 60 and 44percent assembled. Both of their sets of boilers {{were used for}} destroyers. The two ships' turrets were 51 and 75percent complete. Work on <b>Béarn</b> had not significantly progressed by the time war broke out: her hull was only 8–10percent complete and her engines were only 25percent finished.

5|$|Normandie and Languedoc {{were ordered}} on 12 December 1912, {{followed}} by Flandre and Gascogne on 30 July 1913. <b>Béarn</b> was ordered on 3 December; the five ships would permit {{the creation of}} two four-ship divisions with the three Bretagne-class ships then under construction. Work on the class was suspended at the outbreak of World War I, as all resources were needed for the Army. The government did not immediately mobilize for war, as they expected the conflict to be brief. The first four ships were launched {{after the start of}} the war, but only to clear the slipways for other purposes. In July 1915, the Navy determined that the ships were not a priority, and prohibited further work. Later in July, work on the ships' armament was suspended, save the guns themselves, which could be converted for use by the Army. Four of the completed 340mm guns were converted into railway guns for the French Army. Nine of the guns built for Languedoc were also mounted on railway carriages in 1919, {{after the end of the}} war. Several of the 138.6mm guns were also converted for service with the Army.|$|E
5|$|Piers Gaveston's {{father was}} Arnaud de Gabaston, a Gascon knight {{in the service}} of Gaston VII of <b>Béarn.</b> Gabaston had come into a {{substantial}} amount of land in Gascony through his marriage to Claramonde de Marsan, who was co-heir with her brother of the great landowner Arnaud-Guillaume de Marsan. Through the possessions of his wife, Gabaston also became a vassal of the King of England, in the King's capacity of Duke of Aquitaine. His service to Edward I of England stretched {{over a long period of}} time, starting in the Welsh Wars of 1282–83, in which he participated with a substantial contingent. Sometime before 4 February 1287, Claramonde died, and for the rest of his life Gabaston struggled to retain his wife's inheritance from rival claims by relatives and neighbours. Because of this, he became financially dependent on the English king, and was continuously in his service. He was used as a hostage by Edward twice: first in 1288 to Aragon, secondly in 1294 to the French king, when he managed to escape and flee to England in 1297. After returning home, he was back in England in 1300, where he served with Edward I in the Scottish Wars. He died at some point before 18 May 1302.|$|E
