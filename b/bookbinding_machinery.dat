5000|$|Charges {{were brought}} against Sir William Malcolm Mount and F. G. Miles. They were 24 charges {{regarding}} {{publication of a}} Miles Aircraft Ltd prospectus with [...] "false and reckless statements". The trial began on 10 May 1950 of at the Old Bailey. After 17 days of sitting, the jury stopped the case against Miles and Sir William, and they were discharged. They had appeared on charges of inducing people to acquire shares in the company by making a misleading forecast and dishonestly concealing a material fact in a prospectus. According to Flight, [...] "Twenty of the original 24 counts were thrown out before the defence was reached. The prosecution alleged that the defendants gave a misleading forecast that for 1947 the profit covering the production of aircraft would have been £75,000, whereas there was a substantial loss. It was alleged that they recklessly made the misleading statement {{that the company had}} orders on hand which were sufficient to ensure production for the following two years, and that they dishonestly concealed the fact that a profit for the manufacture of aircraft in 1947 was unlikely." [...] Both men said that they believed every word of the prospectus was true. After the acquittal, an application for costs for £20,000 was disallowed. The aviation assets were purchased by Handley Page as Handley Page Reading Ltd. Handley Page produced the Miles-designed M.60 Marathon as the H.P.R.1 Marathon. The Miles Aeronautical Technical School was taken over by the Reading Technical College. Other products in which Miles had interests, such as photocopiers became Copycat Ltd, which was acquired by the Nashua Corporation in 1963. The Philidas locking nut unit became an independent company. The <b>bookbinding</b> <b>machinery</b> and actuator production were taken over by a specifically formed company, the Western Manufacturing Estate Ltd, the name [...] "Western" [...] referring to its location on the Woodley aerodrome. This company later merged with the Adamant Engineering Company Ltd. to form the Adwest Group. Miles also manufactured ballpoint pens designed by László Bíró through an associated company, the Miles Martin Pen Co. Ltd.|$|E
