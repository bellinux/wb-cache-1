50|$|A {{recent study}} found genetic {{evidence}} of multiple instances and species combinations where genetic material has passed the species boundary in bears (a process called introgression by geneticists).

5|$|The sloth bear, {{though not}} as {{specialised}} as polar <b>bears</b> <b>and</b> the panda, has lost several front teeth usually seen in <b>bears,</b> <b>and</b> developed a long, suctioning tongue to feed on the ants, termites, and other burrowing insects they favour. At certain times of the year, these insects can make up 90% of their diets. Some species may raid the nests of wasps and bees for the honey and immature insects, in spite of stinging from the adults. Sun bears use their long tongues to lick up both insects and honey. Fish are {{an important source of}} food for some species, and brown bears in particular gather in large numbers at salmon runs. Typically, a bear plunges into the water and seizes a fish with its jaws or front paws. The preferred parts to eat are the brain and eggs. Small burrowing mammals like rodents may be dug out and eaten.|$|E
