5|$|In making {{preparations}} for filming, the producers {{found that the}} cost of production in the New York City area would be prohibitive and it was also going to <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> locations that resembled early 1950s New York. Part of the financing plan was hinging on a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led to a complete re-think. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, she found that it had not changed much in decades and the state of Ohio also had one of the best film tax incentives in the United States. The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many local citizens as crew.|$|E

25|$|Incompatible systems. A new API or {{communications}} protocol {{may seem to}} work when two systems use different versions, but errors may occur when a function or feature implemented in one version is changed or missing in another. In production systems which must run continually, shutting down the entire system for a major update may not be possible, {{such as in the}} telecommunication industry or the internet. In this case, smaller segments of a large system are upgraded individually, to minimize disruption to a large network. However, some sections could be overlooked and not upgraded, and cause compatibility errors which may <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> and repair.|$|E
25|$|An on-site warden at {{the park}} (http://www.chillinghamwildcattle.com) leads small groups on foot to find the Chillingham cattle herd; on some days they are evident {{in one of the}} easily {{accessible}} meadows, while on rare occasions they can <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> without a fair bit of walking, given the tangled woodlands and the amount of space they have for roaming. Just to the east of the park is the summit of Ros Hill. The cattle are not visible from this viewpoint, which does however give an impressive view over much of north Northumberland. With support from Defra, a network of paths has been created around the periphery of Chillingham Park (http://countrywalks.defra.gov.uk).|$|E

25|$|When an apheresis {{system is}} used for therapy, the system is {{removing}} relatively small amounts of fluid (not more than 10.5 mL/kg body weight). That fluid must be replaced to keep correct intravascular volume. The fluid replaced is different at different institutions. If a crystalloid like normal saline (NS) is used, the infusion amount should be triple what is removed as the 3:1 ratio of normal saline for plasma is needed to keep up oncotic pressure. Some institutions use normal serum albumin, but it is costly and can <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find.</b> Some advocate using fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or a similar blood product, but there are dangers including citrate toxicity (from the anticoagulant), ABO incompatibility, infection, and cellular antigens.|$|E
25|$|In {{probabilistic}} combinatorics, {{the questions}} are of the following type: what is {{the probability of a}} certain property for a random discrete object, such as a random graph? For instance, what is the average number of triangles in a random graph? Probabilistic methods are also used to determine the existence of combinatorial objects with certain prescribed properties (for which explicit examples might <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find),</b> simply by observing that the probability of randomly selecting an object with those properties is greater than 0. This approach (often referred to as the probabilistic method) proved highly effective in applications to extremal combinatorics and graph theory. A closely related area is the study of finite Markov chains, especially on combinatorial objects. Here again probabilistic tools are used to estimate the mixing time.|$|E
25|$|Elinor Ostrom, and {{her colleagues}} looked at how {{real-world}} communities manage communal resources, such as fisheries, land irrigation systems, and farmlands, and they {{identified a number of}} factors conducive to successful resource management. One factor is the resource itself; resources with definable boundaries (e.g., land) can be preserved much more easily. A second factor is resource dependence; there must be a perceptible threat of resource depletion, and it must <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> substitutes. The third is the presence of a community; small and stable populations with a thick social network and social norms promoting conservation do better. A final condition is that there be appropriate community-based rules and procedures in place with built-in incentives for responsible use and punishments for overuse. When the commons is taken over by non-locals, those solutions can no longer be used.|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Jeri Montesano from AllMusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and {{described it as}} [...] "a fun record that doesn't {{need to be taken}} too seriously". He further said that [...] "it would <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a record from this era that sounds half as good. Pop rarely reaches these heights." [...] While reviewing the Buggles' second album, the same author stated that both albums [...] "still sound fresh" [...] compared to 1990s pop music. An Amazon.com editor named Grant Alden also compared the album to 1990s pop, and labeled the group as [...] "Part of the early-1980s great explosion of pop music [...] to have any real impact". Trouser Press called both albums [...] "technically stunning, reasonably catchy and crashingly hollow." ...|$|E

500|$|The caption did {{apparently}} help sales: Landsborough subsequently {{commented that}} while Hamilton's other titles were selling perhaps 15,000 copies, Authentic managed to sell 30,000. After the banners were in place, Hamilton proposed launching a monthly sf magazine. Landsborough {{was concerned about}} the workload, and also felt it would <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> enough good material; Hamilton refused to increase the pay rate, which was not high enough to attract the best stories. A compromise was reached, and Authentic was born as a monthly magazine in paperback format, with a single novel and a short editorial feature in each issue, plus an occasional short story. The eighth issue was the last on the fortnightly schedule. Issues 9–12 were titled [...] "Science Fiction Monthly" [...] in the footer of the cover. In mid-1951, Landsborough left Hamilton, and Campbell replaced him as editor of Authentic with the thirteenth issue, which was also the first one on which the title changed to [...] "Authentic Science Fiction".|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} Rampart Dam was being considered, Alaska as a whole, and Interior Alaska in particular, was sparsely settled. The 1960 United States Census {{recorded}} just 226,127 people as residents of Alaska, {{making it the}} least-populated state in the United States at that time. Interior Alaska contained about 28,000 residents, and promoters suggested that the dam's benefits would vastly outweigh the costs to the few residents who would be displaced. An unnamed Gruening staffer once said the area to be flooded by the dam was worthless, containing [...] "not more than ten flush toilets. Search the whole world and it would <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> an equivalent area with so little to be lost through flooding." [...] In a 1963 letter responding to a Sports Illustrated article about the dam, Gruening wrote, As for the 2,000 Athabascan Indians, they could not but be better off than they are now. Their villages are flooded intermittently by the Yukon. Their habitations are miserable and their livelihood a bare subsistence supplemented by relief. Construction of the Rampart Dam will give them ample gainful employment, and in their new locations, chosen by them on the lake's borders, they will have better homes, better community facilities and a permanent income from now nonexistent activities, generated by the lake.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have drawn}} {{comparisons}} with famous screen action heroines such as Ellen Ripley, portrayed by Sigourney Weaver {{in the original}} Alien trilogy. Ripley {{is seen as a}} ground-breaking depiction of a heroine, whose heroism is neither derived from male support nor hampered by femininity. Rawcliffe writes that Gwen's strength of character makes her a [...] "half Ripley", insofar as she possesses all of Ripley's strength, and yet [...] "is hampered by her reliance on the male characters of Jack, Rhys and Owen". Gwen has been compared, at least superficially, to Buffy Summers, as portrayed by Sarah Michelle Gellar. Reflecting on a scene from Miracle Day, one critic comments that Gwen is [...] "channeling Season Two Buffy the Vampire Slayer" [...] when she shoots at a helicopter from her bazooka (recalling the sequence depicted in Buffy episode [...] "Innocence"). Gwen has attracted implicit comparisons with Lara Croft from the Tomb Raider video game and film franchise. Commenting on the first episode of Torchwood: Miracle Day Den of Geek's Simon Brew states that [...] "whoever Hollywood producers cast in the planned reboot of the Tomb Raider movie franchise, I'm fully confident that Myles could kick their ass. Twice. Before breakfast." [...] While critical of the typical portrayal of British female science fiction characters, The Guardians Krystina Nellis singles out Gwen and Doctor Whos River Song (Alex Kingston) as positive depictions of strong female characters, stating, [...] "It'd <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> two superwomen in less need of a man to save them." ...|$|E
