5|$|Traditionally, {{because of}} strict rules forbidding direct {{conversational}} {{interactions between the}} sexes, the gandingan presented a means for teenagers to interact with one another. Using the gandingan, {{young men and women}} would spend hours teasing, flirting, gossiping, playing guessing games, trading friendly insults and simply conversing with one another. For instance, if friends were telling a boy that a girl liked him but the boy didn’t like her back, the boy wouldn’t resort to telling his friends literally he didn’t like her. Instead, he could use the gandingan to express his reasons and his friends would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up the message by translating his song.|$|E
5|$|Vision {{seems to}} be more {{important}} to the pelagic ray in finding food than in other stingrays. Compared to other members of its family, this species has less than one-third the density of electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini on its underside. The ampullae also cover a smaller area, though not as small as in eagle rays, and are more evenly distributed between the ventral and dorsal surfaces. This ray can detect an electric field of well under 1 nV/cm at a distance of up to , and may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up the minute electric fields produced by moving sea water. The lateral line of the pelagic stingray, a complex system of mechanoreceptors that detect nearby movement and ocean currents, remains similar to other stingrays in covering a greater area on the ventral than the dorsal surface. However, this species is less responsive to mechanical than to visual stimuli.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally Xing Yi was {{an armed}} art. Students would train {{initially}} with the spear, progressing to shorter weapons and eventually empty-handed fighting. This gradually changed throughout the 20th century, as {{the emphasis in}} most traditional Chinese Martial Arts shifted {{from the use of}} weapons to fighting empty-handed. Weapon diversity is great in many lineages, with the idea being that an experienced Xing Yi fighter would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up almost any weapon available (or an object to use as such) irrespective of its exact length, weight and shape.|$|E

500|$|A {{proposed}} {{rule was}} published for comment by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in January, 2013. It would require hybrids and electric vehicles traveling {{at less than}} [...] to emit warning sounds that pedestrians {{must be able to}} hear over background noises. The agency selected 30km/h as the limit because according to NHTSA measurements, this is the speed at which the sound levels of the hybrid and electric vehicles [...] approximated the sound levels produced by similar internal combustion vehicles. According to the NHTSA proposal, carmakers would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> the sounds the vehicles make from a range of choices, and similar vehicles would have to make the same sounds. The rules were scheduled to go into effect in September 2014. The NHTSA estimates that the new warning noises would prevent 2,800 pedestrian and cyclist injuries during the life of each model year electric and hybrid vehicle.|$|E
500|$|In 1929 Wilson hit [...]345 with 39 {{home runs}} and a league-record 159 RBIs. He and new {{teammate}} Rogers Hornsby (who also contributed 39 home runs) led the Cubs to their first NL pennant in eleven years. In the World Series against Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics, Wilson's [...]471 hitting performance was eclipsed by two fielding errors at Shibe Park. Though trailing the Series two games to one, the Cubs were leading by a score of 8–0 in the fourth game when the Athletics mounted a 10-run rally in the seventh inning. Wilson lost two fly balls in the sun; the second, with two runners on base, led to an inside-the-park home run by Mule Haas as the Athletics won 10–8. After the game, McCarthy reportedly told a boy asking for a souvenir baseball, [...] "Come back tomorrow and stand behind Wilson, and you'll <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up all the balls you want!"

500|$|The Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism issued {{guidelines}} for hybrid and other near-silent vehicles in January 2010. In the United States the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010 {{was approved by}} the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives in December 2010. The act does not stipulate a specific speed for the simulated noise but requires the U.S. Department of Transportation to study and establish a motor vehicle safety standard that would set requirements for an alert sound. A proposed rule was published for comment by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in January, 2013.

The rules were scheduled to go into effect in September 2014. However, in January 2015 the NHTSA rescheduled the date for a final ruling to the end of 2015. Since the regulation comes into force three years after being rendered as a final rule, compliance was delayed to 2018.|$|E
500|$|The character, of Turkish descent, is {{described}} as being [...] "torn between two worlds", which Hussen explained are her traditional family life and modern London life. Naz is a family girl who has reached a point in her life where she wants to have fun, but is also a daddy's girl, the apple of her father's eye. He sees her as a perfect student. She has {{a good relationship with}} her parents and is respectful of them, doing what they want, even though they do not know her very well. She loves her family but they do not understand her or what she wants. Hussen opined that Naz would be a good girl if her family did understand her more. What Naz wants is to be like everyone around her and to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> her own boyfriend, but being from a Muslim family means she is unable to. She tries to keep each side of her life secret from the other, but more of each side is seen as the series goes on, and they eventually meet, leading to bad consequences. Hussen opined that this is a common real-life situation that is rarely portrayed on television, so girls would be able relate to the character. Naz likes to make everyone happy but ultimately is more likely to think about her own happiness; she likes to get her own way.|$|E

2500|$|Ideomotor apraxia: [...] These {{patients}} have deficits {{in their ability}} to plan or complete motor actions that rely on semantic memory.

2500|$|As a wine {{starts to}} mature, its bouquet {{will become more}} {{developed}} and multi-layered. While a taster may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> out a few fruit notes in a young wine, a more complex wine will have several distinct fruit, floral, earthy, mineral and oak derived notes. The lingering finish of a wine will lengthen. Eventually the wine will reach a point of maturity, when {{it is said to}} be at its [...] "peak". This is the point when the wine has the maximum amount of complexity, most pleasing mouthfeel and softening of tannins and has not yet started to decay. When this point will occur is not yet predictable and can vary from bottle to bottle. If a wine is aged for too long, it will start to descend into decrepitude where the fruit tastes hollow and weak while the wine's acidity becomes dominant.|$|E
2500|$|It is a {{well-established}} finding that, unlike written language, spoken language {{does not have}} any clear boundaries between words; spoken language is a continuous stream of sound rather than individual words with silences between them. This lack of segmentation between linguistic units presents a problem for young children learning language, who must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> out individual units from the continuous speech streams that they hear. One proposed method of how children are able to solve this problem is that they are attentive to the statistical regularities of the world around them. For example, in the phrase [...] "pretty baby," [...] children are more likely to hear the sounds pre and ty heard together during the entirety of the lexical input around them than they are to hear the sounds ty and ba together. In an artificial grammar learning study with adult participants, Saffran, Newport, and Aslin found that participants were able to locate word boundaries based only on transitional probabilities, suggesting that adults are capable of using statistical regularities in a language-learning task. This is a robust finding that has been widely replicated.|$|E
