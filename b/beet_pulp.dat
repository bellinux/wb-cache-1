It is most commonly associated with ingestion of foods that swell after eating or feeds that are coarse (bedding or poor quality roughage), poor dental care, poor mastication, inadequate drinking, ingestion of a foreign object, and alterations in the normal function of the stomach. Persimmons, which form a sticky gel in the stomach, and haylage, have both been associated with it, as has wheat, barley, mesquite beans, and <b>beet</b> <b>pulp.</b> Horses usually show signs of mild colic that is chronic, unresponsive to analgesics, and may include signs such as dysphagia, ptyalism, bruxism, fever, and lethargy, although severe colic signs may occur. Signs of shock may be seen if gastric rupture has occurred. Usually, the impaction must be quite large before it presents symptoms, and may be diagnosed via gastroscopy or ultrasound, although rectal examinations are unhelpful. Persimmon impaction is treated with infusions of Coca-Cola. Other gastric impactions are often resolves with enteral fluids. Quick treatment generally produces a favorable prognosis.|$|E

40|$|The {{aromatic}} {{characteristics of}} concentrate feeds can affect feed intake in ruminants. In a previous study, the palatability of 14 feeds, mostly concentrates, was tested in lambs and mature dry ewes. In this study, the volatile profile of those feeds {{was measured by}} electronic nose analysis and gas chromatography–olfactometry {{as well as by}} mass spectrometry and the identified compounds were associated with their palatability. Another concentrate feed (barley meal) was used in the training of the animals for the palatability tests and was also subjected to the same instrumental analysis. Feed palatability by the lambs ranged from 0 mg/kg BW to 1379 mg/kg BW in a preference gradient that did not show clear cuts among types of feeds. The ewes, instead, showed clear preferences, with higher (P < 0. 05) level of intake during the 6 min palatability tests for <b>beet</b> <b>pulps,</b> wheat grains, pea grains, and corn grains compared to the other feeds. The electronic nose showed a good separation between the most palatable and the least palatable feeds both in lambs and in ewes. The rank of total volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in the feeds was, in decreasing order: <b>beet</b> <b>pulps</b> (27 VOCs), oat grains (26 VOCs), dehydrated alfalfa (20 VOCs), soybean hulls (19 VOCs), soybean meal 44 (18 VOCs), sunflower meal (16 VOCs), barley meal (15 VOCs), corn gluten meal and soybean meal 49 (14 VOCs), wheat brans (13 VOCs), corn middlings (12 VOCs), canola meal (7 VOCs), wheat grains (6 VOCs), corn grains and pea grains (5 VOCs). The aroma profile of the <b>beet</b> <b>pulps,</b> which were the most eaten feed by ewes and had intermediate intake by lambs, was characterized by a pleasant aroma of green and fruity notes because they were the richest of aldehydes (11 VOCs) and poor of sulphur compounds (2 VOCs). Dehydrated alfalfa and sunflower meal, which were commonly refused by lambs and ewes, were both rich of sulphur compounds (5 VOCs), whose unpleasant notes probably affected their palatability. Soybean meal 44, which was refused by the ewes and the least eaten of soybean by-products by lambs, and sunflower meal were characterized by a rich aroma profile but by a negative note due to the presence of methanamine, which gave an off-flavour identified as rotten fish odour. Oat grains, although characterized by pleasant flavours due to their richness of aldehydes (10 VOCs) and terpenes (7 VOCs), were refused by lambs and ewes. This was probably due to the presence, among the terpenes, of a unique compound (α-pinene), with a resin-pine flavour which is known to negatively affect intake of alfalfa pellets in lambs. Corn gluten meal, which was refused by lambs and ewes, was characterized by the presence of four sulphur compounds, which gave unpleasant notes of garlic and cooked potato to the feed and probably negatively affected its palatability. These results suggested that the aroma of several feeds might have affected animal short-term intake responses. The gas chromatography/olfactometry analysis can be a useful tool to identify potential candidate molecules that might explain the feeding choices of animals in terms of sensorial perceptions. However, {{more research is needed to}} better understand the specific compounds involved and to separate the flavour effects from the many other factors affecting palatability. </br...|$|R
40|$|In {{the light}} of recent {{findings}} in sheep nutrition and behaviour, the diets of grazing dairy sheep {{should be based on}} forages encompassing a variety of complementary nutritional values and containing moderate levels of complementary plant secondary metabolites, until recently regarded as "anti-nutritional".

Diets based on these forages, while ensuring high milking performance, can mitigate the unbalance of CP to energy ratio of grazing sheep. By grazing sulla and annual or Italian ryegrass (50 : 50 by area) as spatially conterminal monocultures or in timely sequence (complementary grazing) sheep eat more and perform better than by grazing the ryegrass pasture only.

40|$|Palatability of {{concentrates}} {{is important}} to avoid feed refusal and production losses in ruminants. Thus, the palatability of 14 feeds (soybean meal 44 and 49; soybean hulls; corn grains; canola meal; wheat grains; beet pulps; dehydrated alfalfa; sunflower meal; oat grains; pea grains; wheat brans; corn middlings; corn gluten meal) was measured in 6 min daily tests on 14 female lambs and 14 dry multiparous ewes. The palatability of the feeds fed to the lambs varied from high to low values in a continuum, suggesting that sensorial perceptions were more important than previous feeding experiences or post-ingestive effects. In contrast the ewes clearly preferred 4 feeds (<b>beet</b> <b>pulps</b> and wheat, pea, and corn grains) over the others, which are common ingredients in concentrate mixes but are rarely used as single ingredients. In two subsequent trials the possibility of enhancing the palatability of canola meal and oat grains, which had low palatability in the previous trial, was tested by adding to them synthetic flavours.

40|$|The agro-industries {{generate}} {{thousands of}} tons of by-products, such as cereal bran or sugar <b>beet</b> <b>pulps,</b> each year. For instance, in the Walloon Region, wheat transformation industry produces about 200, 000 t of bran annually. Most of those by-products are, at best, used for cattle feeding. Through biocracking, this biomass may however constitute a renewable source for various value-added molecules of interest. These include dietary fiber, proteins, antioxidants, etc. The Feruzyme project focuses on ferulic acid, a major example of the hydroxycinnamic acids. These phenolic compounds show excellent antioxidant ability, and are found in relative abundance in cereal bran (about 6. 6 mg. g- 1, dry basis, in wheat bran). Ferulic acid (along with other hydroxycinnamic acids) is in majority (usually about 80 %) ester-linked to other constitutive elements of the cell wall, namely arabinoxylans. Its enzymatic release depends mainly on the breaking of its ester linkage by Ferulic Acid Esterases (FAE, EC 3. 1. 1. 73), which works in synergy with arabinoxylan-degrading enzymes (hemicellulase, including xylanase). Cellulase and even protease may also help by "unweaving" further the complex, cross-linked structure of bran cell-wall. The aim of our project is to design a process, starting from raw wheat bran to obtain purified ferulic acid, either crystallized or in concentrated solution. Furthermore, this process should be feasible at pilot scale, as it is meant to commercial application. Bran pre-treatment may impact the efficiency of the enzymatic action, by facilitating the access of the enzymes to their substrate (grinding, micronisation), or by modifying cell-wall structure (extrusion, steam-explosion, etc. processes involving non-enzymatic hydrolysis). The composition of the bran may also be altered, for instance by destarching, but also by pearling, this process being able to separate richer layers within the bran. Simpler process, like fine sieving of ground bran, is sufficient to eliminate part of the starch (wheat bran starch granules are usually about 20 µm). Purified FAE are still not commercially available. However, several enzyme complexes do present FAE activity: Depol™ 740 l (Biocatalysts), Pentopan™ 500 BG and Novo™ 188 (Novozymes), Pectinase™ PE (Catalysts), Grindamyl™ S 100 (Danisco), etc. These complexes are used as filtration aid or for bread making. FAE activity is usually a side activity, the major being hemicellulase and cellulase, except for Depol™ 740 l in which FAE activity is standardized (36 U. g- 1).

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the behaviour of different sulphur feed contents on pig excretion via faeces and urine, to evaluate the speciation of sulphur forms excreted and to determine further behaviour of sulphur in pig slurry during anaerobic storage. The sulphurs content of 76 different raw materials usually used to formulate pig feeding diets was measured and classified. Total sulphurs content varied between 0. 5 to 10 gS. kg- 1 of dry material. For most of these raw materials, total sulphur content was correlated with sulphur amino acid composition. Then, two experiments were conducted with ﬁnishing castrated male pigs (n= 10; n= 20) randomized and individually housed in metabolic cages which allowed precise control for feed alimentation and excretion collection. Ten experimental diets based on wheat and on soybean meal were compared. They differed by the incorporation of different raw materials with different total S content (wheat malt, <b>beets</b> <b>pulp</b> or rapeseed meal). Total crude protein content for all formulations tested varied between 16. 5 and 20 %. Trials were realised during 20 days with 10 days dedicated for new feed adaptation followed by 10 days when urine and faeces were individually collected. At the end of the experimental procedure, the feed, faeces and urine collected for each studied pig were analysed for total solids, volatile solids, total sulphur and sulphate. Feed sulphur content varied between 1. 6 and 4. 1 g. kg- 1 of total solids. For all experiments, sulphur retention by animals was close to 25 % of the total ingested S whereas 75 % was excreted. Sulphurs were excreted as 100 % sulphate speciation form in urine and 50 % sulphate in faeces. With this dataset, sulphurs concentrations as sulphates in fresh pig slurries were determined and ranged between 0. 5 and 1. 7 gS. kg- 1 depending on the feed formulation. Behaviour of sulphate content of fresh pig slurry was studied with spiking raw pig slurry with different amounts of sulphate (0 to 2 gS. kg- 1) and volatile fatty acids (acetic, propionic and butyric acids). Kinetics of sulphate consumption and sulphide apparition were measured. In anaerobic storage condition of pig's slurries, added sulphate was consumed within 3 weeks by a first order kinetics reaction to form solely sulphides.
