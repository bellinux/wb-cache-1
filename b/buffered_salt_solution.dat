40|$|Introduction: Recent {{evidence}} indicates that the choice of intravenous fluids may affect outcomes in critically ill patients. Methods: We recorded the administration of resuscitation fluids in patients admitted to Australian and New Zealand adult intensive care units (ICUs) for a 24 -h period at 6 time points between 2007 and 2013. Changes in patterns of fluid use over this period were determined using regression analyses. Results: Of the 2825 patients admitted to the 61 ICUs on the 6 study days, 754 (26. 7 %) patients received fluid resuscitation. Of those receiving fluid resuscitation, the proportion of patients receiving crystalloid significantly increased from 28. 9 % (41 / 142) in 2007 to 50. 5 % (48 / 95) in 2013 (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2. 93; 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 1. 35 – 6. 33; p = 0. 006); of these, the proportion of patients receiving <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solutions</b> significantly increased from 4. 9 % (7 / 142) in 2007 to 31. 6 % (30 / 95) in 2013 (OR 7. 00; 95 % CI 2. 14 – 22. 92; p = 0. 001). The use of colloids significantly decreased from 59. 9 % (85 / 142) in 2007 to 42. 1 % (40 / 95) in 2013 (adjusted OR 0. 34; 95 % CI 0. 16 – 0. 74; p = 0. 007) due to {{a significant decrease in}} the proportion of patients receiving gelatin; 28. 9 % (41 / 142) to 2. 1 % (2 / 95) (OR 0. 10; 95 % CI 0. 03 – 0. 29; p ≤ 0. 001). Conclusion: Fluid resuscitation practice in Australia and New Zealand adult ICUs has changed over the 6 -year study period.

40|$|A new glass, {{obtained}} from Bioglass BG 45 S 5 original composition by substituting CaO with MgO, was produced and its chemical durability and microstructural characteristics {{were compared with}} that of Bioglass 1. The two glasses (labelled as BG 45 and MG 45) were soaked up to 4 weeks at physiological temperature in different solutions, i. e. bi-distilled water, Hank’s <b>Buffered</b> <b>Salt</b> <b>Solution</b> 61200 (labelled as HBSS+), Hank’s <b>Buffered</b> <b>Salt</b> <b>Solution</b> 14170 (labelled as HBSS), and Kokubo’s SBF.

Moreover, the MG 45 glass never exhibited hydroxyapatite crystal formation on its surface also after soaking in calcium- containing solutions. The apatite crystallisation and deposition mechanism, typical of a bioactive glass, was induced only if the glass itself contained calcium. The contemporaneous presence of calcium in the glass and in the soaking solution improved the reactivity of the glass, as apatite crystals nucleated in a shorter time and grew more quickly.

40|$|A {{specific}} enhancer for the m+ {{variant of}} echovirus 6 was isolated from uninfected, permissive host cells. The enhancer transferred the susceptibility to virus infection from permissive cells to less susceptible cells. Enhancer activity in cultured, human cells (WISH) {{was released by}} these cells into extracellular fluids at a linear rate. Maximal enhancer activity was recovered from cell monolayers that were extracted with <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solutions</b> (pH 6. 6) for 5 h at 37 C. Crude enhancer preparations contained substances that reduced virus titers in permissive host cells and suppressed some of the enhancer activity.

The enhancer, in contrast to inhibitory substances, remained in supernatant fractions after centrifugation at 110, 000 × g for 4 h and adsorbed to diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex columns. Enhancer preparations that were devoid of inhibitory activity increased the virus titers in less susceptible simian cell cultures (approximately 100 -fold) to the titers attained by fully permissive human cell cultures.

40|$|ABSTRACT The pseudopods of Caenorhabditis elegans {{spermatozoa}} move actively {{causing some}} cells to translocate when the sperm are dissected into a low osmotic strength <b>buffered</b> <b>salts</b> <b>solution.</b> On time-lapse video tapes, pseudopodial projections {{can be seen}} moving at 20 - 45 Am/min from the tip {{to the base of}} the pseudopod. This movement occurs whether or not the cell is attached to a substrate. Translocation of the cell is dependent on the substrate. Some spermatozoa translocate on acid-washed glass, but a better substrate is prepared by drying an extract of Ascaris uteri (the normal site of nematode sperm motility) onto glass slides. On this substrate more than half the spermatozoa translocate at a velocity (21 Am/min) similar to that observed in vivo. Translocating cells attach to the substrate by their pseudopodial projections. They always move toward the pseudopod; changes in direction are caused by changes in pseudopod shape that determine points of detachment and reattachment of the cell to the substrate. Actin comprises < 0. 02 % of the proteins in sperm, and myosin is undetectable. No microfilaments are found in the sperm. lmmunohistochemistry shows that some actin is localized in patches in the pseudopod. The movement of spermatozoa is unaffected by cytochalasins...|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} effect of biorelevant apical {{conditions}} on intestinal permeability estimation of amprenavir in the Caco- 2 system. Absorptive amprenavir transport across Caco- 2 monolayers was determined using different apical conditions; amprenavir dissolved in <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solution</b> (10 µM) was used as control condition. The effect of the following apical media on permeability was evaluated: <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solution</b> enriched with d-&[alpha]-tocopheryl polyethyleneglycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), Fasted State Simulated Intestinal Fluid (FaSSIF) and blank human intestinal fluid (HIF) aspirated from the duodenum and jejunum of fasted volunteers. Also HIF aspirated after administration of a soft gelatin formulation of amprenavir (Agenerase&[reg]) was used. When studying amprenavir transport across Caco- 2 monolayers, the absorptive permeability coefficient (Papp) increased from 12. 8 ± 0. 4 · 10 - 6 cm/s for the control condition to 20 ± 2 · 10 - 6 cm/s when using FaSSIF or blank HIF as apical medium. Including verapamil in either of these conditions further increased transport, illustrating that amprenavir is a substrate of P-glycoprotein related efflux carriers. When using HIF aspirated after intake of the amprenavir formulation, a wide range in Papp values (8 · 10 - 6 - 25 · 10 - 6 cm/s) was obtained; inclusion of verapamil did not increase amprenavir transport. Compared to the control condition, these fluids contained bile salts, phospholipids and the solubilizing excipient TPGS, responsible for amprenavir concentrations up to 5 mM. TPGS {{has been shown to}} inhibit P-glycoprotein, explaining the absence of an additional effect of verapamil. P-glycoprotein appears not to be functionally active in the presence of HIF aspirated after intake of an amprenavir formulation. This illustrates that differences between standard apical conditions and conditions representative for the in vivo luminal environment may affect the outcome of drug transport studies. A better understanding of intraluminal conditions after oral drug intake may improve the biorelevance of in vitro permeability estimation. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Presently, the Caco- 2 {{cell culture}} model {{is widely used}} during drug {{discovery}} and development as a predictive tool for the oral absorption of drug candidates. For transport experiments in the Caco- 2 system, HBSS-like <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solutions</b> are commonly used, although different shortcomings {{have been associated with}} the use of these buffers. In this paper, we investigated the effect of using fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF) as potential biorelevant medium for the drug permeability estimation across Caco- 2 monolayers. The transport characteristics of 19 model compounds were determined in the Caco- 2 cell culture model in the presence of FaSSIF as compared to classic transport medium. A sigmoidal relation was obtained when the estimated P(app), s of the apical to basolateral transport were plotted versus the reported values of the fraction absorbed in man. Although no effect of FaSSIF as compared to classic transport medium (TM) was observed on the total predictability of the model, an impact was demonstrated (1) on the bi-directional transport of actively transported drugs (including talinolol, digoxin and doxorubicin), (2) on recovery and (3) on the solubility and permeability estimation of poorly water-soluble drugs. The observed differences may be attributed to a P-gp inhibitory effect of sodium taurocholate (NaTC), micellar encapsulation by the NaTC/lecithin mixed micelles and/or an increase of the solubility of lipophilic drugs. As the experimental conditions should mimic the physiological in vivo conditions, the use of FaSSIF as medium during Caco- 2 experiments may improve the biorelevance of the model. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Our earlier {{paper has}} {{reported}} that Wharton’s jelly is a reservoir of several peptide growth factors, including acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF and bFGF, respectively). Both can be extracted by <b>buffered</b> <b>salts</b> <b>solutions</b> {{in the form of}} high molecular mass complexes, probably with a component(s) of the extracellular matrix. Both aFGF and bFGF from such extracts hardly penetrate 10 % polyacrylamide gels during electrophoresis. Pre-treatment of Wharton’s jelly with hyaluronidase slightly increased the extractability of aFGF, but did not affect the extractability of bFGF. In contrast, the pre-treatment of tissue homogenate with bacterial collagenase (2000 U/ ml, 37 °C, 18 h) increased the extractability of bFGF. The presence of β-mercaptoethanol in the extracting solutions increased the extractability of both FGFs, but did not release FGFs in their free form, despite reducing the molecular mass of the FGF-containing complexes. We conclude that both aFGF and bFGF are bound through disulphide bonds to a protein component of Wharton’s jelly. We propose that ground substance composed mainly of collagen fibrils and hyaluronate molecules, which surrounds the cells of Wharton’s jelly, prevents the access of the extracting solution to aFGF and bFGF. Although hyaluronate and collagen do not bind aFGF or bFGF directly, they may constitute a barrier which prevents the dispersion of FGFs in Wharton’s jelly. Thus, the high concentration of FGFs around the cells of Wharton’s jelly may facilitate the interaction of these factors with membrane receptors, thereby resulting in stimulation of cell division and differentiation, {{as well as of the}} synthesis of extracellular matrix components...|$|R
40|$|In 2007, the Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation-Translation of Research Into Practice Study (SAFE-TRIPS) {{reported}} that 0. 9 % sodium chloride (saline) and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) {{were the most}} commonly used resuscitation fluids in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Evidence has emerged since 2007 that these fluids are associated with adverse patient-centred outcomes. Based on the published evidence since 2007, we sought to determine the current type of fluid resuscitation used in clinical practice and the predictors of fluid choice and determine whether these have changed between 2007 and 2014. In 2014, an international, cross-sectional study was conducted (Fluid-TRIPS) to document current patterns of intravenous resuscitation fluid use and determine factors associated with fluid choice. We examined univariate and multivariate associations between patients and prescriber characteristics, geographical region and fluid type. Additionally, we report secular trends of resuscitation fluid use in a cohort of ICUs that participated in both the 2007 and 2014 studies. Regression analysis were conducted to determine changes in the administration of crystalloid or colloid between 2007 and 2014. In 2014, a total of 426 ICUs in 27 countries participated. Over the 24 hour study day, 1456 / 6707 (21. 7 %) patients received resuscitation fluid during 2716 resuscitation episodes. Crystalloids were administered to 1227 / 1456 (84. 3 %) patients during 2208 / 2716 (81. 3 %) episodes and colloids to 394 / 1456 (27. 1 %) patients during 581 / 2716 (21. 4 %) episodes. In multivariate analyses, practice significantly varied between geographical regions. Additionally, patients with a traumatic brain injury were less likely to receive colloid when compared to patients with no trauma (adjusted OR 0. 24; 95 % CI 0. 1 to 0. 62; p = 0. 003). Patients in the ICU for one or more days where more likely to receive colloid compared to patients in the ICU on their admission date (adjusted OR 1. 75; 95 % CI 1. 27 to 2. 41; p = < 0. 001).

40|$|Fixed {{strains of}} {{neurotropic}} viruses {{are characterized by}} relative inabifity to enter {{the central nervous system}} after peripheral inoculation. In previous communications (1) it was emphasized that a fixed strain of equine encephalomyelitis virus had very weak invasive powers when injected subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. The incidence of infection after intramuscular inoculation could be sharply increased by the injection of 50 per cent glycerine intraperitoneally in adequate amounts (1). The present paper attempts to determine under what conditions this phenomenon is operative, whether it can be produced by other agents, and to gain some suggestions as to the mechanism involved. Methods In the present study the same strain of fixed E. E. virus used previously was employed. The material used for inoculations was infected mouse brain tissue, emulsified 1 : 10 in sterile <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solution,</b> and centrifuged to throw down the coarse particles. This stock suspension (100) or appropriate decimal dilution was used...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to explore the functional relationship between oxygen concentration during tissue reoxygenation after ischemia and the extent of postischemic lipid peroxidation, an indicator of reoxygenation injury. Excised rat liver or kidney tissue was rendered ischemic for 1 h at 37 °C, minced into 1 mm 3 fragments, and then reoxygenated for 1 h in flasks of <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solution</b> containing various amounts of oxygen. Production of malondialdehyde-like material (MDA) was measured to indicate lipid peroxidation. MDA production was minimal at oxygen tensions less than 10 mmHg, increased sharply from 10 to 50 mmHg, and plateaued at approximately 100 mmHg. A similar functional relationship was produced by a simple mathematical model of free radical mediated lipid peroxidation in biological membranes, suggesting that MDA production is indeed caused by free radical oxidation of membrane phospholipids and that the oxygen effect is governed by simple competition between chain propagation and chain termination reactions within the membrane. These experimental and analytical results confirm that relatively low concentrations of oxygen arc sufficient to produce oxidative damage in post-ischemic tissues...|$|E

Intracellular concentrations of sodium and potassium ions in a marine pseudomonad. J. Bacteriol. 87 : 510 – 518. 1964. —Washed cells of a marine pseudomonad were suspended in <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solutions</b> containing, {{in addition to}} MgSO 4, NaCl and KCl at various concentrations. The cells were centrifuged from the medium and analyzed for Na+ and K+. Inulin and C 14 -carboxypolyglucose were employed to estimate the volume of extracellular fluid associated with the packed cells. Intracellular Na+ and K+ concentrations were determined by correcting {{for the amount of}} Na+ and K+ in the extracellular fluid. At all levels of Na+ in the suspending medium (0 to 1 m), the intracellular and extracellular Na+ concentrations within the limits of experimental error were the same. The intracellular K+ concentrations were approximately double the extracellular concentrations at the two levels of K+ tested (0. 01 and 0. 15 m) and were not influenced by the amount of Na+ present. Intracellular and extracellular Cl− concentrations were the same at the one level of Cl− examined. The intracellular fluid volume varied with the NaCl or KCl concentration of the suspending medium, being greatest in the absence of added salts, decreasing to a minimum at 0. 3 m salt, and then increasing slightly at higher salt concentrations. Most of the intracellular Na+ could be removed by washing with solutions of MgSO 4 or sucrose, but a small amount [10 to 15 μmoles/g (dry weight) ] remained bound to the cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} low, nonfreezing {{temperatures}} on {{the viability of}} five strains of Chromobacterium violaceum was studied. The viability of cultures grown at 30 C was determined after exposure to various diluents held at 0 to 2 C. A culture diluted at its growth temperature served as the control. Cells of strain N were most sensitive {{in the early part}} of the exponential phase of growth. Cells of strains 252 and 341 were most sensitive in the late exponential, early stationary phase of growth. Cells of strain 9 showed greatest loss of viability during the maximal stationary phase. Strain 69 was completely resistant throughout its growth cycle to cold injury. Cell viability was much greater in <b>buffered</b> <b>salts</b> <b>solution</b> than in distilled water, broth, or physiological saline, whether cultures were diluted at room temperature or in the cold. The proportion of cells surviving after exposure to cold, however, was the same regardless of the composition of the diluent. Loss of viability was progressive at 0 to 2 C and reached a maximum after 2 hr. There was no loss of viability of cells exposed to 20 C, but there was some loss at 12 C. Strain 341 cultivated at 15 C was much less sensitive to 0 to 2 C than when it was cultivated at 30 C. The composition of the growth medium seemed to have no effect on the survival of cells exposed to cold. The polyamines, spermine and trimethylenediamine, as well as erythritol and sucrose, exerted some protective action against the effects of cold but not uniformly for all strains studied...|$|R

40|$|Two {{strains of}} the {{lymphogranuloma}} venereum virus were maintained in tissue cultures for 12 and 21 generations respectively. In a third strain a quantitative increase in potency as high as 1000 times was obtained by inoculating tissue cultures with infected emulsions of known virulence. Greater increases in potency were consistently obtained by maintaining tissue cultures and virus at room temperature (23 °C. {{with a range of}} approximately ± 5 °C.) than by incubating them at 37 °C. The virus did not survive in the absence of oxygen. Embryonic guinea pig brain and serum ultrafiltrate were found to be the most effective vehicles for propagation of the lymphogranuloma virus. There is evidence that the site of activity for this virus is intracellular. Embryonic guinea pig brain cells were maintained in the serum ultrafiltrate diluted with <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solution</b> in good (morphologic) condition for as long as 70 days. Not only could old cultures be successfully inoculated with the virus of lymphogranuloma, but high titres could be maintained over extended periods...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to determine whether α 2 -adrenoceptors mediate endothelium-dependent relaxations in veins and arteries of the pulmonary and systemic vasculature of the dog. Rings of either pulmonary or femoral artery and vein with and without endothelium were suspended for isometric force measurements in a <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solution</b> (37 °C; gassed with 95 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2). Removal of the endothelium caused a shift {{to the left of the}} concentration-response curves to epinephrine, norepinephrine and the selective α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist UK 14, 304, but not of that to the selective α 1 -adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine. In the presence of α 1 - and β-adrenoceptor blockers, norepinephrine and UK 14, 304 initiated relaxations of previously contracted rings. These relaxations were inhibited by the α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, rauwolscine, and were absent in rings without endothelium. In the pulmonary artery and femoral vein, the endothelium-dependent responses to UK 14, 304 were masked in part by direct α 2 -adrenergic activation of the vascular smooth muscle. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The drug {{puromycin}} aminonucleoside (PA), used {{to induce}} an experimental nephrosis in rats, inhibited the blastogenic response of normal rat spleen cells when cultured in vitro with autologous or heterologous serum. Only at final PA concentrations {{of less than}} 5 microgram/ml did PHA induce normal blastogenesis. When PA was unilaterally perfused through the rat kidney a nephrosis developed, characterized by massive proteinuria. Microscopically, the foot process fusion and mesangial cell increase were similar to that seen in human steroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome. Once proteinuria had developed, there was marked suppression of the lymphocyte blastogenic response of the nephrotic rat spleen cells when cultured in autologous sera. Neither proteinuria nor inhibited blastogenesis was found in animals perfused with a <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solution.</b> Animals which were perfused with PA, nephrectomized 2 days after perfusion, and did not show proteinuria, had suppressed lymphocyte blastogenesis after stimulation with PHA. However, the degree of stimulation by the spleen cells of these animals {{was similar to that}} from control perfused and nephrectomized animals. Therefore, the aberration in lymphocyte response was consistent with the development of the nephrosis and proteinuria...|$|E
40|$|As a {{step towards}} the {{definition}} of a medium suitable for long-term storage of potential organ transplants, a study was made of the effects of various solutions on the viability of monolayers of cells stored at 4 degrees. It was found that, for these to survive {{for more than a few}} hours, an essential component of the medium was a non-toxic solute which did not cross the cell membrane at low temperatures and could therefore counterbalance the osmotic effect of the intracellular proteins. A high K+/Na+ ratio and hyperosmoticity, separately or together, were ineffective in the absence ofsuch a solute and unnecessary in its presence. The most effective non-permeating solute tested was polyethylene glycol, mol. wt. 20, 000 cells stored in a 1 % solution of this in phosphate <b>buffered</b> balanced <b>salt</b> <b>solution</b> remained viable for at least 24 hours and could subsequently be grown in culture...|$|R
40|$|During the {{evaluation}} and selection of drug candidates, the Caco- 2 cell culture system {{is commonly used}} for the determination of intestinal transport characteristics and to anticipate permeability limited drug absorption. Although classic HBSS-like <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solutions</b> are commonly used to perform Caco- 2 transport experiments, different shortcomings (e. g., adsorption and low solubility) {{have been associated with}} the use of plain aqueous buffers. As transport experiments performed with unoptimized conditions may compromize the value of the Caco- 2 model as a permeation screening tool, many efforts have been made to optimize the experimental conditions of Caco- 2 transport assays. In this minireview, the hurdles {{associated with the use of}} saline aqueous buffers in Caco- 2 transport experiments are summarized and the different options, which have been proposed to overcome these issues, are reviewed and discussed. Biologically, pharmaceutically, as well as analytically relevant media affecting the outcome of the transport experiments are described. Unfortunately, up to now, no systematic studies comparing the different experimental conditions have been performed, jeopardizing the possibility to define a (single) optimal solution to overcome the different issues associated with the use of saline aqueous buffers. Based on the reported options it can be proposed to use DMSO (<or= 1 %) in standard screening procedures for the ranking of compounds based on their apical to basolateral transport. If compounds are not soluble in DMSO 1 %, dimethylacetamide (3 %) or N- 1 -methyl-pyrrolidone (2. 5 %) are good alternatives. However, these options do not imitate the in vivo situation. If one wants to take into account the physiological relevance of the media, the use of a biologically relevant apical medium (e. g., FASSIF) in combination with an analytically friendly, sink condition creating basolateral solvent (e. g., containing a micelle forming agent) can be suggested. status: publishe...|$|R

In contrast, the ratio of residual radicals for the CuCI 2 (1. 00. 10 - 5 M) and [Cu(Pir) 2 (DMF) 2] (1. 08. 1 0. 5 M) /HPir (8. 01. 10 " 5 M) systems was 5. The [Cu=(Pir) 2] compound is therefore a stronger radical scavenger than either HPir or CuCI 2. A molecular mechanics (MM) analysis of the gas phase structures of neutral HPir, its zwitterionic (HPir+’) and anionic (Pir’) forms, and some Cu"-piroxicam complexes based on X-ray structures allowed calculation of fome constants. The most stable structure for H Pir has a ZZZ conformation similar to that found in the Cu " (and Cd = = complexes) in the solid state {{as well as in the}} gas phase. The structure is stabilized by a strong H bond which involves the N(amide) -H and O(enolic) groups. The MM simulation for the [Cu=(Pir) 2 (DMF) 2] complex showed that two hig...|$|R
