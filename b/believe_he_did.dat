5|$|Did Harrison {{deliberately}} use {{the music}} of He's So Fine? I do not <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so deliberately. Nevertheless, {{it is clear that}} My Sweet Lord is the very same song as He's So Fine with different words, and Harrison had access to He's So Fine. This is, under the law, infringement of copyright, and is no less so even though subconsciously accomplished.|$|E

25|$|It {{is still}} debated whether Horn {{committed}} the Nickells murder. Historians including Chip Carlson <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not, while others such as Dean Fenton Krakel {{believe that he}} did, but had not realized he was shooting a boy. The consensus is that regardless of whether Horn committed that particular murder, he had certainly committed many others. Carlson, who extensively researched the Wyoming v. Tom Horn trial, concluded that although Horn could have committed the murder of Willie Nickell, he probably did not. According to Carlson's book, Tom Horn: Blood on the Moon (2001), there was no physical evidence that Horn had committed the murder. In addition, he was last seen in the area the day before it occurred, and the conditions of his alleged confession made it without value as evidence. Carlson believed the prosecution made no efforts to investigate other possible suspects, including Victor Miller. In essence, Horn's reputation and history made him {{an easy target for}} the prosecution.|$|E

500|$|Myrie-Williams joined League Two side Port Vale on loan on 24 November, {{joining the}} club until January 2012. A day later, on 25 November, {{he made his}} debut for Port Vale in a 0–0 home draw against Torquay United, playing the whole match. During the game, he {{impressed}} manager Micky Adams— [...] "He (Myrie-Williams) lifted me, as I'm asking people to be positive and show character, because the fans are disappointed {{with the way things}} have gone recently, and we need to give them something to shout about, which I <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> I thought he was outstanding, he looked exciting on the ball and he got crosses into the box". In his next appearance for the club, he scored the equalising goal in a 2–1 win at Dagenham & Redbridge, when he [...] "blasted in" [...] a [...] "25-yard blockbuster"– fellow Stevenage loanee Madjo went on to score the winning goal. Myrie-Williams' effort was Vale's first goal in 502 minutes (more than five games) of football. He won a penalty in his fourth game for the club, which was converted by Marc Richards to give Vale a 2–1 win at Hereford United. He returned to Broadhall Way in January having scored one goal in six games for Port Vale, who were unable to extend the loan deal due to an acute lack of funds.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Abagnale himself {{addressed}} the issue of his story's truthfulness with a statement posted on his company's website which said in part: [...] "I was interviewed by the co-writer only about four times. I <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> a great job of telling the story, but he also over-dramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style and what the editor wanted.

2500|$|Some Finegan detractors <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{little more}} to {{contribute}} to the Confederate victory at Olustee than to shuttle troops forward to General Alfred H.

They point out that Finegan was quickly relieved of his command over the state troops, replaced by Major General James Patton Anderson. But this change in command was necessary as Finegan was ordered to lead the [...] "Florida Brigade" [...] in the Army of Northern Virginia, where he served effectively until {{near the end of the}} war.|$|E
2500|$|Rove {{was fired}} from the 1992 Bush presidential {{campaign}} after he planted a negative story with columnist Robert Novak about dissatisfaction with campaign fundraising chief Robert Mosbacher Jr. (Esquire Magazine, January 2003). Novak provided some evidence of motive in his column describing the firing of Mosbacher by former Senator Phil Gramm: [...] "Also attending the session was political consultant Karl Rove, who had been shoved aside by Mosbacher." [...] Novak and Rove deny that Rove was the leaker, but Mosbacher maintained that [...] "Rove {{is the only one}} with a motive to leak this. We let him go. I still <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it." ...|$|E
