5|$|In September York {{arrived from}} Ireland, {{and at the}} {{parliament}} of October that year, the duke {{walked up to the}} throne and put his hand on it. The act, signifying usurpation, left the assembly in shock. It is unclear whether Warwick had prior knowledge of York's plans, though it is assumed that this had <b>been</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>upon</b> between the two in Ireland the previous March. It soon became clear, however, that this regime change was unacceptable to the lords in parliament, and a compromise was agreed. The Act of Accord of 31October 1460 stated that while Henry VI was allowed to stay on the throne for the remainder of his life, his son Edward, Prince of Wales, was to be disinherited. Instead, York would succeed the king, and act as protector.|$|E
5|$|In 1791 and 1792, Jones {{surveyed}} the lakeshore of townships east from York, Upper Canada, to the Trent River, from the lakeshore to {{a distance of}} one mile (1.6km) from Lake Ontario. Jones and his team had set out from Scarborough to the eastern boundary of the Nassau District, the approximate area of {{the mouth of the}} Trent River. From there, they began surveying townships along Lake Ontario travelling westwards. They surveyed in turn Murray Township, then Cramahe Township, Haldimand Township, Hamilton Township, Hope Township, Clarke Township, Darlington Township, Pickering Township, Glasgow Township, York Township and Etobicoke Township. Sideroads were then run north to the first concession road. Clarke township had previously been unnamed, Jones was the one to name it. The survey of the west end of the Nassau district finalised the boundary of the Toronto Purchase, which had <b>been</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>upon</b> in principle, but could not be completed because the land areas involved were not well known. On June 13, 1792 Jones submitted a town plan for Newark, Upper Canada to the Land Board.|$|E
5|$|In a game {{versus the}} Reds on June9, {{the score was}} tied 5–5in {{the bottom of the}} ninth inning when Stivetts {{connected}} for a pinch-hit, walk-off solo home run. This was his second career walk off home run, his third as a pinch hitter, and the last home run of his career. It was reported on July22 that a deal had <b>been</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>upon</b> to trade Stivetts to the St. Louis Browns of the NL for Kid Carsey and cash. The deal was contingent upon the acceptance of Stivetts. In early August, the Boston manager Selee sent Stivetts home, commenting that the team did not have use of his services any longer. Tim Hurst, now managing St. Louis, planned on using Stivetts in center field. Stivetts refused to accept the move to St. Louis, and a sale was officially conducted on August14 that sent him to St. Louis for $2000 and an unnamed player. True to his word, Stivetts did not report, or play a single game for St. Louis that season. Due to his objection to being sold to St. Louis, he claimed that he would remain in Ashland and return to coal mining.|$|E

5|$|While {{the victors}} were not {{limited by the}} Treaty of Versailles, many of the major naval powers were {{crippled}} after the war. Faced {{with the prospect of}} a naval arms race against the United Kingdom and Japan, which would in turn have led to a possible Pacific war, the United States was keen to conclude the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess, and required Britain to accept parity with the U.S. and to abandon the British alliance with Japan. The Washington treaty was followed by a series of other naval treaties, including the First Geneva Naval Conference (1927), the First London Naval Treaty (1930), the Second Geneva Naval Conference (1932), and finally the Second London Naval Treaty (1936), which all set limits on major warships. These treaties became effectively obsolete on September 1, 1939 at the beginning of World War II, but the ship classifications that had <b>been</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>upon</b> still apply. The treaty limitations meant that fewer new battleships were launched in 1919–39 than in 1905–14. The treaties also inhibited development by putting maximum limits on the weights of ships. Designs like the projected British , the first American , and the Japanese —all of which continued the trend to larger ships with bigger guns and thicker armor—never got off the drawing board. Those designs which were commissioned during this period were referred to as treaty battleships.|$|E

Maximilian then promised to repay all loans of its predecessor to Jakob Fugger.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the debate}} is mathematical, but some major {{elements}} can be explained in simple terms {{and as part of}} the 'aggregation problem'. That is, the critique of neoclassical capital theory might be summed up as saying that it suffers from the fallacy of composition, i.e., that we cannot simply jump from microeconomic conceptions to an understanding of production by society as a whole. The resolution {{of the debate}}, particularly how broad its implications are, has not <b>been</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>upon</b> by economists.|$|E
25|$|By March 1943, {{the first}} National Conference of the Communist Party elected Hoxha {{formally}} as First Secretary. During World War II, the Soviet Union's role in Albania was negligible. On 10 July 1943, the Albanian partisans were organised in regular units of companies, battalions and brigades and named the Albanian National Liberation Army. The organization received military {{support from the}} British intelligence service, SOE. The General Headquarters was created, with Spiro Moisiu as the commander and Hoxha as political commissar. The Yugoslav Partisans had a much more practical role, helping to plan attacks and exchanging supplies, but communication {{between them and the}} Albanians was limited and letters would often arrive late, sometimes well after a plan had <b>been</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>upon</b> by the National Liberation Army without consultation from the Yugoslav partisans.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the negotiators}} had <b>been</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>upon,</b> {{the two sides}} moved to {{designate}} foreign guarantor countries.

Exploratory meetings continued in Havana in February 2012, with limited social exchanges between the two negotiating teams to preserve the confidentiality of the talks. By August 2012, nearly ten preparatory rounds had taken place, with each round lasting between four and eight days for a total of approximately 65 encounters between both sides.
