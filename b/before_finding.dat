5|$|Adopted {{children}} are children that were given up at birth, abandoned or {{were unable to}} be cared for by their biological parents. They may have been put into foster care <b>before</b> <b>finding</b> their permanent residence. It is particularly hard for adopted children to get adopted from foster care: 50,000 children were adopted in 2001. The average age of these children was 7, which shows that fewer older children were adopted.|$|E
5|$|Keith finds Duncan in Cuba. After {{a lengthy}} investigation, Veronica concludes {{that she and}} Duncan had consensual sex {{when they were both}} drugged. The Kanes believe that Veronica is Duncan's sister, and Keith learns that Abel Koontz couldn't have killed Lilly. Veronica goes public with her {{relationship}} with Logan <b>before</b> <b>finding</b> a series of cameras in his bedroom.|$|E

5|$|Bobby Robson's {{appointment}} {{followed a}} chance encounter with Ipswich director Murray Sangster while scouting at Portman Road for Chelsea manager Dave Sexton. Robson {{had some experience}} of management from his time at Fulham, although he had been sacked after failing to avoid relegation from Division Two. Robson's sides finished 18th and 19th {{in his first two}} seasons at Ipswich, but he kept the team in the top division, <b>before</b> <b>finding</b> greater success. Robson led the club to fourth place in the First Division and success in the Texaco Cup, beating local rivals Norwich City 4–2, in the 1972–73 season.|$|E

The Governor finds his former right-hand men and kills them, taking over their group and destroys the prison. Rick's group are forced to separate and flee, but not before Hershel and the Governor are killed. The survivors divide, face their own trials and meet new faces <b>before</b> <b>finding</b> signs pointing to a safe haven called Terminus. One by one, they reunite at Terminus, but all the group are captured for some unknown purpose.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is August to January {{with one or}} two broods raised. The male proposes suitable nest sites to the female by hopping around the area. Unlike other robins, the female sometimes initiates the site selection. A pair spends anywhere from one to five days looking <b>before</b> <b>finding</b> a suitable site. The female constructs the nest alone. Eucalypts are generally chosen, but birds have been recorded nesting in Pinus radiata on Mount Wellington in Tasmania. The flame robin is more versatile in its selection of nesting sites than other robins, and has even been recorded nesting in sheds.|$|E

Rejecting his advances, Zero {{examines}} {{some of the other}} exhibits (including displays on Typhoid Mary and the Tuskegee syphilis study) <b>before</b> <b>finding</b> an African green monkey, another suspected early AIDS vector. The monkey (Marla Lukofsky) angrily denounces Zero for scapegoating her just as he has been scapegoated. Zero turns to Burton and they make love.|$|E
5|$|With the {{cancellation}} of Ellen, DeGeneres focused her energy on stand-up comedy, where she had begun her career. She returned to network television in 2001 with the short-lived The Ellen Show, in which her character Ellen Richmond was openly lesbian from the start, <b>before</b> <b>finding</b> renewed success with her talk show The Ellen DeGeneres Show, beginning in 2003, which as of July 2017 is still running and is in its fourteenth season.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees of the {{subgenus}} Psithyrus (known as 'cuckoo bumblebees', and formerly {{considered a}} separate genus) are brood parasites, sometimes called kleptoparasites, {{in the colonies}} of other bumblebees, and have {{lost the ability to}} collect pollen. <b>Before</b> <b>finding</b> and invading a host colony, a Psithyrus female, such as that of the Psithyrus species of B. sylvestris, feeds directly from flowers. Once she has infiltrated a host colony, the Psithyrus female kills or subdues the queen of that colony, and uses pheromones and physical attacks to force the workers of that colony to feed her and her young. Usually, cuckoo bumblebees can be described as queen-intolerant inquilines, since the host queen is often killed to enable the parasite to produce more offspring, though some species, such as B. bohemicus, actually enjoy increased success when they leave the host queen alive.|$|E

30|$|The {{idea that}} {{everyday}} {{activities such as}} learning music or speaking a second language can make a person smarter has gained increasing popularity. The {{good news is that}} early research studies found better mental performance in musicians and bilinguals. However, recent investigations failed to reproduce performance improvements in experts, leaving it uncertain whether robust benefits exist. Moreover, since musical training and bilingualism have largely been tested separately, the relative benefits from each remain unclear. <b>Before</b> <b>findings</b> can be applied to real-world settings such as education, healthy development and aging, and cognitive dysfunction, the reliability and uniqueness of a cognitive advantage in experts must be established.|$|R
40|$|Early in the 1990 s, two {{separate}} and equally momen-tous events occurred, {{both of which}} would change the connection between forensic psychiatry and the law. Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (1993) 1 and evidence-based practice (EBP) both emerged as elements that would stimulate assessment of the best available scientific evidence to be em-ployed in reaching judicial decisions. Both empha-size that research methods supporting evidence should be critically appraised <b>before</b> <b>findings</b> can be extrapolated within the legal (Daubert) or the prac-tice (EBP) context. In addition, both created a shift toward transparent procedures for answering scien-tific questions. Although these similarities seem com-pelling, both have existed essentially independent o...|$|R
5|$|Having premiered in {{the small}} sixty-seat Royal Court Theatre, it quickly moved to larger venues in London, {{transferring}} to the 230-seat Chelsea Classic Cinema on Kings Road on 14 August 1973, <b>before</b> <b>finding</b> a quasi-permanent home at the 500-seat King's Road Theatre from 3 November 1973, running for six years. The musical made its U.S. debut in Los Angeles in 1974 before being played in New York City {{as well as other}} cities. Producer and Ode Records owner Lou Adler attended the London production in the winter of 1973, escorted by friend Britt Ekland. He immediately decided to purchase the U.S. theatrical rights. His production would be staged at his Roxy Theatre in L.A. In 1975, The Rocky Horror Show premiered on Broadway at the 1,000-seat Belasco Theatre.|$|E
5|$|In 1893 {{at the age}} of 19, Goddard {{left her}} family and went to Paris. She {{extracted}} a meager allowance from her mother, took voice lessons, and for a time sang in a cabaret, <b>before</b> <b>finding</b> out she was pregnant and delivering a baby girl on February 17, 1887. She placed the infant in a convent for care, then travelled to Rome to study art. Goddard was the only female student in her life class, as it was unusual for women to work from nude models. She encountered what would now be called sexual harassment. When a fellow student left a book open on her stool with pornographic passages underlined, she picked it up and hit him in the face with it, but he and his friends stalked her. She fled to Capri after he tried to force her to marry him.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, when Roddenberry {{was twelve}} years old, {{the family moved to}} 4906 Monte Vista in the shadow of Mount Washington, and he began {{attending}} Luther Burbank Junior High School. This was the house that Roddenberry would later describe as his childhood home. His father helped the boys obtain local jobs; Gene worked as a newspaper delivery boy and as a gas station attendant on Saturdays, and after school. The young Roddenberry moved to Franklin High School during the middle years of the Great Depression. His father was relatively unaffected by the Great Depression because of his stable employment with the police department. The family distributed food to friends and family who were in need. Glen's parents and her younger sister Willodean moved into the house for a time <b>before</b> <b>finding</b> other accommodation in Redondo Beach. During his time at Franklin, Roddenberry joined the Varsity Debate Team and {{was a member of the}} Authors Club under Mrs. Virginia Church. He graduated in 1939.|$|E
40|$|The {{involvement}} {{of parents in}} their child’s hospital care has been strongly advocated in paediatric healthcare policy and practice. However, incorporating parental worries about their child’s condition into clinical care can be difficult for both parents and healthcare professionals. Through our “Listening To You” quality improvement project we developed and piloted an innovative approach to listening, incorporating and responding to parental concerns regarding their child’s condition when in hospital. Here we describe the phases of work undertaken to develop our “Listening To You” communications bundle, including a survey, literature review and consultation with parents and staff, <b>before</b> <b>findings</b> from the project evaluation are presented and discussed...|$|R

5|$|Li becomes {{obsessed with}} Ah Jong's act of good will. He and Tsang find that Ah Jong visits Jennie at her apartment; {{they plan to}} arrest him {{the next time he}} visits her. Ah Jong visits Jennie and is caught in an ambush from which he manages to escape. Li and Tsang explain to Jennie that Ah Jong was the assassin that blinded her at the nightclub. Ah Jong meets with his Triad manager, Fung Sei, and demands his payment for the job. Fung Sei brings a {{suitcase}} for Ah Jong, who discovers it to be filled with sheets of blank paper <b>before</b> <b>finding</b> himself {{in the middle of a}} Triad ambush. He kills all of the hitmen, but leaves Fung Sei alive. The next day, after Fung Sei's pleas for Wong Hoi fall on deaf ears, Ah Jong does a hit-and-run on Wong Hoi's car, wounding the Triad leader and killing his driver and bodyguard.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{ordered his}} first lieutenant, Henry Parkyns Hoppner, to take Lord Amherst {{and his party}} {{in two of the}} boats to an island, known today as Pulo Leat, three miles away. The island's thick {{vegetation}} prevented an assessment of whether it was inhabited, and forced the boat crews to row a further three miles along the shore <b>before</b> <b>finding</b> a suitable landing spot between the mangroves. The rest of the ship's company were evacuated in the remaining boats and a large raft. Because of the lack of provisions, in particular drinking water, it was decided that Hoppner would continue with Amherst and his embassy to Java, roughly 200 miles to the south. Once there, a rescue could be initiated.|$|E

After an angry {{telephone}} call from Fletcher's wife, Joanne, Mulder—still inside Fletcher's body—goes to Fletcher's home. Instead of sleeping in the bedroom, he decides to sleep downstairs in an easy chair and watch pornography. When he is awoken by Joanne, he mumbles Scully's name. While changing his clothes, Mulder receives {{a telephone call from}} Smoodge, who explains that the military has surveyed the wreckage of the craft from the night <b>before,</b> <b>finding</b> one of the human pilots merged into a rock but still alive. Another soldier, Captain Robert McDonough, had switched bodies with an elderly Hopi woman, as evident from McDonough's aberrant behavior.|$|E

5|$|The {{family moved}} again in 1809, {{settling}} on Bayou Teche in Louisiana <b>before</b> <b>finding</b> {{a permanent home}} in Opelousas in 1812. The Bowie children were raised on the frontier and even as small children were expected to help clear the land and plant crops. All the children learned {{to read and write}} in English, but James and his elder brother Rezin could also read, write, and speak Spanish and French fluently. The children learned to survive on the frontier and how to fish and run a farm and plantation. James Bowie became proficient with pistol, rifle, and knife, and had a reputation for fearlessness. When he was a boy, one of his Indian friends even taught him to rope alligators.|$|E

The police arrive to arrest them for trespassing, but the protagonist uses the opportunity to perform a McTwist over the helicopter and onto the awning of an adjacent hotel, allowing them and an awestruck Eric to evade the police. The team then travels to Vancouver, British Columbia. After doing errands for locals and finishing their {{part of the team}} video, the protagonist attends the video premiere at the Slam City Jam. However, Eric steals the idea and edits the protagonist's part out of the video, allowing only Eric to become a professional. After angrily confronting Eric, the protagonist enters Eric's pro contest and wins, becoming a pro as well.|$|E
5|$|This sparrow feeds {{mainly on}} the seeds of herbs and grains, but it also eats berries and insects, {{particularly}} during the breeding season. This diet makes it a minor pest in agricultural areas, but also a predator of insect pests. While breeding, it is not social, as its nests are dispersed. It forms flocks when not breeding, although it associates with other bird species infrequently. In some parts of its range, the russet sparrow migrates, at least to lower altitudes. Its nest {{is located in a}} tree cavity, or a hole in a cliff or building. The male chooses the nest site <b>before</b> <b>finding</b> a mate and uses the nest for courtship display. The typical clutch contains five or six whitish eggs. Both sexes incubate and feed the young.|$|E
