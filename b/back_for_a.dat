5|$|The courts {{eventually}} {{decided the}} Warner Bros. lawsuit in Cagney's favor. He {{had done what}} many thought unthinkable: taking on the studios and winning. Not only did he win, but Warner Bros. also {{knew that he was}} still their foremost box office draw and invited him <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> five-year, $150,000-a-film deal, with no more than two pictures a year. Cagney also had full say over what films he did and did not make. Additionally, William Cagney was guaranteed the position of assistant producer for the movies in which his brother starred.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{development}} {{began when}} Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. After {{the success of}} the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be released in July 2011. With the signing of Johansson in March 2009, the film was pushed <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio, in August and New York City in September. The film was converted to 3D in post-production.|$|E
5|$|The long tail of Kentrosaurus {{results in}} a {{position}} of the center of mass that is unusually far <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> quadrupedal animal. It rests {{just in front of the}} hip, a position usually seen in bipedal dinosaurs. However, the femora are straight in Kentrosaurus, as opposed to typical bipeds, indicating a straight and vertical limb position. Thus, the hindlimbs, though powered by massive thigh muscles attached to a long ilium, did not support the animal alone, and the very robust forelimbs took up 10 to 15% of the bodyweight.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{play in the}} game's {{second half}} scored another {{touchdown}}. Quarterback Doc Kuhn dropped <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> more than 40-yard touchdown pass to Bomar. The pass went 28 yards in the air, with Bomar running {{the rest of the}} way. Georgia running back Dave Collings tackled him as he crossed the goal line (injuring himself), and Bomar also made an interception in the 12–0 Vanderbilt victory. The season's final game, against Vanderbilt's oldest rival Sewanee, had a trick play by the Commodores. A fake run ended with Kuhn tossing the ball to Bomar, who was left open behind the defense and easily ran it in; Vanderbilt won, 26–0.|$|E
5|$|After year-long {{expectations}} that the ninth season {{would be the}} series' last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> final tenth season. The series' creative team {{did not want to}} extend negotiations into the next year, and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale. NBC agreed to pay $10million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series. Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series. The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.|$|E
5|$|In March 1888, Riley {{traveled}} to Washington, D.C. {{where he had}} dinner at the White House {{with other members of}} the International Copyright League and President of the United States Grover Cleveland. Riley made a brief performance for the dignitaries at the event before speaking about the need for international copyright protections. Cleveland was enamored by Riley's performance and invited him <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> private meeting during which the two men discussed cultural topics. In the 1888 Presidential Election campaign, Riley's acquaintance Benjamin Harrison was nominated as the Republican candidate. Although Riley had shunned politics for most of his life, he gave Harrison a personal endorsement and participated in fund-raising events and vote stumping. The election was exceptionally partisan in Indiana, and Riley found the atmosphere of the campaign stressful; he vowed never to become involved with politics again.|$|E

5|$|In {{the week}} before the Final, a block of 1,600 tickets in the Liverpool supporters' seating area was stolen in the postal system. The stadium {{authorities}} refused to reissue the tickets on crowd safety grounds, and threatened to eject anyone found sitting in the block from the stadium and possibly prosecute them for receiving stolen goods. Liverpool F.C. arranged for most of the affected fans to receive tickets from an allocation that had been held <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lottery among their supporters. The day after the final, South Wales Police seized 100 stolen tickets. Three people were arrested after 15 forged tickets were found ahead of the match.|$|E
5|$|Lavelli {{initially}} {{planned to}} retire in 1955 but came <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> final year in 1956, when the Browns posted a 5–7 record, the team's first-ever losing season. In his 11-year career, Lavelli caught 386 passes for 6,488 yards and 62 touchdowns. He was a confident receiver, former teammates said in later years. He could often be heard calling for Graham to throw him the ball while running routes. He was also known {{for his ability to}} improvise on the field. In a 1955 game against the Eagles in slippery conditions, he caught the winning touchdown with less than a minute left by swinging around the goalpost with his arm to get open.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{began the}} 1975–76 Football League {{campaign}} losing 2–0 to Queens Park Rangers (QPR). Liverpool's form {{picked up in}} the second half of the season. Only one point dropped in nine late season games left them a point behind QPR going into their final match. QPR had already finished their games. Wolverhampton Wanderers were a goal up at half-time but Liverpool won 3–1 to win the League title. Liverpool exited early in the FA Cup and League Cup. In the 1976 UEFA Cup Final, Club Brugge scored two early goals at Anfield before Ray Kennedy, Case and a Keegan penalty fought <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 3-2 first leg lead. Keegan's equaliser in Belgium was enough for a 4-3 aggregate win and a second Liverpool winning of that trophy.|$|E
