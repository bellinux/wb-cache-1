50|$|Furniture cross dowel {{barrel nuts}} are {{cylindrical}} shaped metal nuts (metal dowels) used with furniture connector bolts to join {{two pieces of}} wood. The inside threaded hole is unusual in that it passes through {{the sides of the}} dowel. To install, the pieces of wood to be joined are aligned, then a <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> is drilled through one piece of wood and into the other. A dowel hole is drilled laterally across the <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> and the cross dowel is inserted into it. The end of the cross dowel is slotted so that a screwdriver can be inserted to rotate the dowel so that its threaded shaft aligns with the <b>bolt</b> <b>hole.</b> The furniture connector bolt is then inserted into the <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> and screwed into the cross dowel until the wood pieces are held tightly together.|$|R
25|$|A {{major problem}} of jointed track is {{cracking}} around the <b>bolt</b> <b>holes,</b> {{which can lead}} to breaking of the rail head (the running surface).

25|$|The center two intake bolts on each head were {{relocated}} to prevent accidental mix-ups of Gen-2 and Gen-3 intakes. The intakes can be interchanged by slotting the <b>bolt</b> <b>holes,</b> but the added deck {{height of the}} GEN-3 engine means that sealing and port match will be compromised. Gen-3 intakes can be machined to fit Gen-2 engines by surface grinding the intake flanges and slotting the center holes.|$|E
40|$|The bolting cabin {{assistance}} system prevents operators from facing dangerous situations. This system {{consists of}} a bolting robot control system and a top view supervisory system. In order to control the bolting robot, circular Hough transforms and fuzzy reasoning are used.

25|$|The {{ship was}} put in dry dock {{for the first time}} at Lyttelton and the carpenter, Frederick Dailey, {{prepared}} a lengthy report detailing the numerous empty <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> and slack hull fittings he found. Six feet (1.8 metres) of water had seeped into the ship's bilges and lower hold through badly-sealed joints in the planking. While these were repaired there was considerable dispute between the RGS and Dundee Shipbuilders as to who was responsible for the defects, but the Discovery left for the Antarctic on December 21, 1901 after three weeks in New Zealand.|$|E

500|$|Launching the Musashi also {{presented}} problems. The ship's [...] thick launch platform, made of nine [...] Douglas fir planks bolted together, {{took two years}} to assemble (from keel-laying in March 1938) {{because of the difficulty}} in drilling perfectly straight <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> through 4m of fresh timber. The problem of slowing and stopping the massive hull once inside the narrow Nagasaki Harbour was met by attaching [...] of heavy chains {{on both sides of the}} hull to create dragging resistance in the water. The launch was concealed by means including a citywide air-raid drill staged on the launch day to keep people inside their homes. Musashi was launched on 1 November 1940, coming to a stop only [...] in excess of the hull's expected [...] travel distance across the harbour. The entry of such a large mass into the water caused a [...] tsunami, which swept the harbour and local rivers, flooding homes and capsizing small fishing boats. Musashi was fitted out at nearby Sasebo, with Captain Kaoru Arima assigned as her commanding officer.|$|E
2500|$|The fatal {{fatigue crack}} in the inner lower boom had {{initiated}} at a bolt hole at Station 143, the rearmost of five <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> for attachment of the inner engine nacelle to the lower boom. [...] These holes were ⅞ inch (2.22cm) diameter and were anodised to resist wear and corrosion. [...] A cadmium-plated steel bush of length 1 ⅝ inch (4.13cm), chamfered at one end, was pressed into each hole. [...] Each bush was an interference fit in the hole to improve fatigue resistance and substantially increase the retirement life of the inner lower boom.|$|E

In 1972 the bell housing bolt pattern {{was changed to}} match the AMC V8's - its final use was in 2006 when the 4.0 was phased out. Four bolts on the cylinder block are matched to the transmission bellhousing where an adapter plate serves both as a dust cover - two additional <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> on the transmission bellhousing used on the AMC V8 are used to secure the dust cover. The 1971 258 uses the [...] "small" [...] pattern, the only year 258 to do so.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{construction}} can begin, {{the structural}} ironworkers {{put together the}} cranes {{that will be used}} to lift the steel columns, beams, and girders according to blueprints to erect a structure. To hoist the steel, structural ironworkers use cables connected to the crane to lift the beams onto the steel columns. [...] A rope called a tagline is attached to the beams so an ironworker can control the beams if necessary. [...] The crane hoists steel into place, and the ironworkers position the beams in place with spud wrenches to align <b>bolt</b> <b>holes.</b> [...] Then, the beams can be bolted to the steel columns. [...] This process is continued until there are no beams or columns left to construct the structure. Structural ironworkers also erect joist girders, bar joists, trusses and install metal decking.|$|E
2500|$|The typical {{structural}} ironworker {{tools are}} the spud wrench, bolt bag, sleever bars, bull pins, drift pins and beaters. The spud wrench {{is the most}} important tool of a structural ironworker because it serves dual purposes. [...] It is a wrench to tighten bolts, and {{the opposite end of the}} wrench can be used to align holes of beams with columns. It is made from a steel alloy, and it has a gradual taper to easily align <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> on beams. The bolt bag is a heavy canvas bag used for storing bolts and nuts that erect a structure. A sleever bar is a steel alloy bar used to pry on beams to put them in place, when a spud wrench is insufficient. [...] A beater is forged steel head mallet with a lacquered hickory handle for beating a tapered pin or bull pin into the bolt hole to align the others at the beam end or [...] "point" [...] and stuff the rest of the holes. Drift pins have a tapper on both ends and get to be the largest diameter in the center. Are used for aligning holes made up of multiple plates.|$|E

40|$|In the present, simple {{analysis}} method for <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> clearance stresses in mechanically fastened joints, an inverse formulation is {{used with a}} finite element analysis. Conditions along the <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> contact arc are specified by displacement constraint equations. The method was applied to a single fastener clearance-fit joint with typical clearance values, for the cases of a rigid, frictionless bolt and a quasi-isotropic graphite/epoxy laminate. Results indicate that the contact arc, {{as well as the}} peak stresses around the hole (and their locations), were strongly influenced by the clearance. After a minor initial nonlinearity, peak stresses varied linearly with applied load. Clearance levels are found to have only a minor influence on overall joint stiffness...|$|R

50|$|In {{sandwich}} structures, impact {{results in}} dents {{of various sizes}} and depending on the energy levels, puncture damage is not unusual. In this case both skins may be damaged. Other common damage types include heat damage and <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> damage. The heat damage {{is caused by the}} exposure at high temperature which causes a local fracture with separation of surface plies. The <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> damage is cause by the bearing stresses at the contact surfaces of the composite structure with a bolt or rivet used for joining purposes. This could result in elongation of the hole causing laminate splitting, or damage to the upper plies. In any case, the effect on the mechanical performance depends on the thickness of the damaged part.|$|R
