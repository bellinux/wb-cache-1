5|$|By October 6 the Egyptian naval {{task force}} was at Bab-el-Mandeb where they broke radio silence. When Operation Badr began at 14:00, Rear Admiral Fuad Abu Zikry {{authorized}} the fleet {{to proceed with}} the <b>blockade</b> via a codeword. Egyptian submarines and destroyers intercepted ships traveling through Bab-el-Mandeb destined for Eilat, and all Israeli maritime navigation in the Red Sea ceased. The <b>blockade</b> was a strategic success for Egypt, while the Israeli Navy and Air Force were incapable of lifting the <b>blockade</b> due to the long distance between Israel and Bab-el-Mandeb. Mines were laid {{at the entrance to the}} Gulf of Suez to prevent Israel from transporting oil from the Sinai fields to Eilat. Historian Gammal Hammad claims that a <b>blockade</b> was also enforced in the Mediterranean, while other sources dispute this. News of the <b>blockade</b> was censored in Israel.|$|E
5|$|In the American Civil War, {{camouflage}} paint was applied {{by both sides}} during the Union <b>blockade</b> of 1861–1865. <b>Blockade</b> runners aiding the Confederates sometimes painted their ships all in mist-gray, to hide themselves in coastal fog. One Union <b>blockade</b> crew may have painted their rowboat white, and its oars, and wore white clothing for a night reconnaissance patrol up an enemy-held river.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the French Revolutionary Wars was the effect of British <b>blockade</b> on French movements. The Royal Navy {{maintained}} an active close <b>blockade</b> of all major French ports during the conflict, which resulted in every French ship that left port facing attack from squadrons and individual ships patrolling the French and allied coasts. The losses the French Navy suffered {{as a result of}} this strategy were high, and the <b>blockade</b> was so effective that even movement between ports along the French coasts was restricted. In the Indian Ocean however the huge distances between the French bases on Réunion and Isle de France and the British bases in India meant that close <b>blockade</b> was an ineffective strategy: the scale of the forces required to maintain an effective constant <b>blockade</b> of both islands, as well as the Dutch ports at the Cape of Good Hope and in the Dutch East Indies were too large to be worth their deployment to such a distant part of the world. As a result, the French raiders operating from the Indian Ocean bases were able to travel with more freedom and less risk of interception than those in the Atlantic or Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|Until April 1865, Bignonia {{served with}} the North Atlantic <b>Blockading</b> Squadron as a tug. She was reassigned to the West Gulf <b>Blockading</b> Squadron in April 1865.|$|R
25|$|In orders sent on May 1, 1861 Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles {{appointed}} Flag Officer Silas H. Stringham {{to command}} the Coast <b>Blockading</b> Squadron. Stringham received this order and took command on May 4, 1861. His new command was to be headquartered at Hampton Roads, Virginia and was given responsibility for the <b>blockading</b> of the coast from the capes of the Chesapeake to the southern extremity of Florida and Key West. On May 17, 1861 the Coast <b>Blockading</b> Squadron was re-designated the Atlantic <b>Blockading</b> Squadron.|$|R
50|$|On June 15, 1992, {{after the}} capture of the Goranboy district, Azerbaijan {{launched}} an offensive {{in the direction of}} Aghdara. Confronted with tough resistance, it took the Azerbaijani forces many days of fierce fighting before Aghdara could be <b>blockaded.</b> 708th Agdam brigade cut the southern route into Aghdara. 703rd brigade <b>blockaded</b> the northern routes. 701st brigade <b>blockaded</b> Aghdara from the direction of Kelbajar, to the west.|$|R
5|$|During the French Revolutionary Wars the Royal Navy had exerted {{dominance}} at sea {{over its}} continental rivals, most immediately the French Navy with its principal fleet based at Brest on the Breton {{coast of the}} Bay of Biscay. To contain this fleet the British practiced a close <b>blockade</b> strategy; maintaining a fleet off Brest whenever weather conditions permitted to prevent the French fleet from breaking out into the Atlantic Ocean. This <b>blockade</b> force also limited French trade and maritime communications, attacking merchant ships and individual warships seeking to resupply or reinforce the main French fleet. This made French maritime journeys extremely hazardous even in inshore waters: in June 1795 the main French fleet had suffered a defeat {{at the hands of}} the <b>blockade</b> force at the Battle of Groix in the approaches to the port of Lorient, while at the Action of 13 January 1797 the independently sailing 74-gun ship of the line Droits de l'Homme was driven ashore and destroyed in the approaches to Brest by two frigates of the <b>blockade</b> squadron.|$|E

5|$|Recommissioned on 15 February 1864, Galena, {{now under}} the command of Lieutenant Commander C. H. Wells, sailed on 18 February for the Gulf of Mexico and the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. The ship became icebound at New Castle, Delaware, until she was towed out to sea by an ice boat, and was forced to put into port for repairs. She {{departed}} Norfolk on 10 May and arrived at Pensacola, Florida on 20 May for <b>blockade</b> duty off Mobile, Alabama, during which she shelled Fort Morgan and fired upon various <b>blockade</b> runners as they attempted to evade the <b>blockade.</b>|$|E
50|$|Goldsborough {{was given}} {{command of the}} Atlantic <b>Blockading</b> Squadron in September 1861, {{relieving}} Flag Officer Silas H. Stringham. In October of that year the Atlantic squadron was split into the North Atlantic <b>Blockading</b> Squadron and South Atlantic <b>Blockading</b> Squadron; Goldsborough took command of the North squadron, and Flag Officer Samuel Francis DuPont assumed command of the South squadron. During his command of the North Atlantic <b>Blockading</b> Squadron, which he commanded from its inception to September 1862, he led his fleet off North Carolina, where in cooperation with troops under General Ambrose Burnside, he captured Roanoke Island and destroyed a small Confederate fleet.|$|R
50|$|Norwich got {{underway}} 2 January 1862 for Port Royal, South Carolina {{where she}} joined the South Atlantic <b>Blockading</b> Squadron. She was stationed off Savannah, Georgia and <b>blockaded</b> that important port during the following two months.|$|R
50|$|The South Atlantic <b>Blockading</b> Squadron was tasked {{primarily}} with preventing Confederate ships from supplying troops and with supporting Union troops operating between Cape Henry in Virginia down to Key West in Florida. It was created when the Atlantic <b>Blockading</b> Squadron was {{split between the}} North and South Atlantic <b>Blockading</b> Squadrons on 29 October 1861. After {{the end of the}} war, the squadron was merged into the Atlantic Squadron on 25 July 1865.|$|R
5|$|The JNA {{attacks on}} Dubronik and Zadar were {{supported}} by the Yugoslav Navy, which blockaded the coast on two more occasions. On 3 October, all shipping off Croatia, except for ferry lines to Pag and islands in the Kvarner Gulf, was halted. The <b>blockade,</b> except for that of Dubrovnik, was lifted on 11 October. The final <b>blockade,</b> restricting access to Rijeka, Zadar, Šibenik and Split in addition to Dubrovnik, started on 8 November. On 15 November, the Yugoslav Navy sustained losses when it unsuccessfully attacked Split and the island of Brač. The Yugoslav <b>blockade</b> in the northern Adriatic ended on 22 November, but in the southern Adriaticexcept off Dubrovnikit was lifted on 3 December.|$|E
5|$|The <b>blockade</b> of the South {{caused the}} Southern economy to {{collapse}} during the war. Shortages {{of food and}} supplies were caused by the <b>blockade,</b> the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, and foraging by Union and Confederate armies. The standard of living fell even as large-scale printing of paper money caused inflation and distrust of the currency. By 1864 the internal food distribution had broken down, leaving cities without enough food and causing food riots across the Confederacy. The Union victory at the Second Battle of Fort Fisher in January 1865 closed the last useful Southern port, virtually ending <b>blockade</b> running and hastening {{the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem with}} {{enforcing}} a close <b>blockade</b> with ships was that warships loitering {{off the coast}} of Japan would be vulnerable to attack by aircraft and submarines. Blockading Japanese ports with small ships was a possibility, but this would first require the destruction or neutralisation of the Japanese fleet, and it was far from certain that the Japanese fleet would place itself in a position where it could be destroyed. A plan was adopted for a more distant <b>blockade,</b> whereby ships bound for Japan would be intercepted as they passed through the East Indies or the Panama Canal. This would not cut off Japan's trade with China or Korea, and probably not with the United States either. The effectiveness of such a <b>blockade</b> was therefore questionable.|$|E
25|$|On May 15 Bankhead was {{assigned}} to USS Pembina and which was ordered to join the <b>blockading</b> force off Charleston. Pembina {{was assigned}} to this important <b>blockading</b> station because of her shallow draft, which was necessary for this inshore duty.|$|R
50|$|Ordered to the Gulf <b>Blockading</b> Squadron and {{allocated}} to the West Gulf <b>Blockading</b> Squadron when Union naval responsibility in the area was divided early the next year, she served {{at the mouth of}} and in the Mississippi River for the next seven months.|$|R
50|$|In 1800, Purísima Concepción was {{attached}} to the Spanish fleet in the Second Campaign of the English Channel. Later in the year she was <b>blockaded</b> by the British Fleet under Rear Admiral John Colpoys at Brest. She remained <b>blockaded</b> at Brest until 1801.|$|R
5|$|When the Italo-Turkish War of 191112 {{began on}} 29 September 1911, Pisa was the {{flagship}} of Rear-Admiral Ernesto Presbitero, {{commander of the}} 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. Pisa and her sister ship, , were among the ships selected for the initial <b>blockade</b> of Tripoli. On 2 October, the Training Division relieved the 1st Squadron in <b>blockade</b> duty, allowing them to join the main Italian fleet.|$|E
5|$|Although {{pleased with}} {{the result of the}} engagement, Lord Keith issued strict {{instructions}} that Nelson was to remain in active command of the <b>blockade</b> and on no account to return to Palermo. If {{he had to go to}} port in Sicily, then he was to use Syracuse instead. Keith then sailed to Livorno, where his flagship was destroyed in a sudden fire that killed over 700 of the crew, although Keith himself was not on board at the time. By early March, Nelson had tired of the <b>blockade</b> and in defiance of Keith's instructions returned to Palermo again, leaving Captain Thomas Troubridge of HMS Culloden in command of the <b>blockade</b> squadron. In March, while Nelson was absent at Palermo, the ship of the line Guillaume Tell, the last survivor of the Nile, attempted to break out of Malta but was chased down and defeated by a British squadron led by Berry in Foudroyant. Although Nelson briefly returned in April, both of the Hamiltons were aboard his ship and most of his time was spent at Marsa Sirocco in the company of Emma, with whom he was now romantically attached.|$|E
5|$|By 1810 the French Navy fleet {{based in}} the Atlantic ports had been {{prevented}} from launching any major operations for four years, penned into harbour by the British strategy of close <b>blockade.</b> A failed attempt by a French fleet to sail had been defeated at the Battle of Basque Roads in 1809, and the main operations still {{carried out by the}} Navy were undertaken by privateers and frigate squadrons operating commerce raiders operating from smaller ports, such as those on the English Channel. In November 1810 squadrons were based at Cherbourg, with two ships of the line and the newly built frigate Iphigénie, and Le Havre, with the frigates Elisa and Amazone, commanded by Captains Louis-Henri Fraycinet-Saulce and Bernard-Louis Rosseau respectively. To <b>blockade</b> these squadrons, the Royal Navy's Channel Fleet had assigned the ships of the line HMS Donegal under Captain Pulteney Malcolm and HMS Revenge under Captain Charles Paget to patrol the entrance to Cherbourg, while frigates HMS Diana under Captain Charles Grant and HMS Niobe under Captain John Wentworth Loring kept watch on Le Havre. The <b>blockade</b> had achieved some minor successes; in October 1810 Revenge had captured the privateer Vengeur from Dieppe, and on 6 November Donegal ran down and seized the privateer Surcouf from Cherbourg.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Blockades</b> {{imposed by}} {{coalition}} forces, particularly Saudi Arabia, {{have been extremely}} detrimental to Yemen, as the country relies heavily on the import of essential items, such as fuel and medicine. Joanne Liu, the head of Doctors Without Borders, has claimed that the <b>blockades</b> imposed on Yemen [...] "killing as (many people as) the current conflict". The <b>blockades</b> imposed could be argued to breach the right to food, especially in a country such as Yemen, which imports 90% of its food.|$|R
5|$|By {{the late}} French Revolutionary Wars (1793–1802), {{a string of}} {{victories}} at sea ensured that the Royal Navy was dominant. The French Navy in particular had suffered heavy losses, and in Northern European waters had been forced back into its own harbours by British <b>blockade</b> squadrons. Although large ports were watched by fleets of ships of the line, small ports had their own <b>blockade</b> squadrons too, including the shallow French ports on the English Channel. These harbours could not accommodate ships of the line but were well situated for frigates that attacked shipping in British waters whenever they could escape the <b>blockade.</b> One such port was Dunkirk in French Flanders, which contained a squadron of four French frigates: the 44-gun Poursuivante under Commodore Jean-Joseph Castagnier, the 40-gun Carmagnole and the 36-gun Désirée and Incorruptible. Dunkirk was well defended, with gun batteries and gunboats overlooking the harbour. In addition, the port was surrounded by complicated coastal shoals into which the frigates could retreat if attacked.|$|E
5|$|By {{virtue of}} geography, the Royal Navy {{was able to}} use her {{imposing}} battleship and battlecruiser fleet to impose a strict and successful naval <b>blockade</b> of Germany and kept Germany's smaller battleship fleet bottled up in the North Sea: only narrow channels led to the Atlantic Ocean and these were guarded by British forces. Both sides were aware that, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, a full fleet engagement would be likely to result in a British victory. The German strategy was therefore to try to provoke an engagement on their terms: either to induce a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coastline, where friendly minefields, torpedo-boats and submarines could be used to even the odds. Germany's submarines were able to break out and raid commerce, but even though they sank many merchant ships, they could not successfully <b>blockade</b> Great Britain – in contrast to Britain's successful battleship <b>blockade</b> of Germany, which was a major cause of Germany's economic collapse in 1918. The Royal Navy on the other hand, successfully adopted convoy tactics to combat Germany's submarine <b>blockade</b> and eventually defeated it.|$|E
5|$|Carrier Air Group 8 (CVG-8) was {{established}} on 15 September 1948 {{in response to}} the Berlin <b>Blockade</b> with newly qualified pilots and reservists who volunteered for active duty. VA-84 and VA-85, the air group's attack squadrons, began receiving Maulers in November and the last aircraft was delivered in January 1949. Later that month the air group made a flyover of President Harry Truman's Inauguration ceremony. The squadron conducted their qualifications aboard the Midway from 3 to 6 May with ten Maulers crashing into the safety barrier between them. CVG-8 made a two-week cruise aboard the Midway beginning on 27 June along the East Coast of the United States, before it was disbanded in November after the peaceful resolution of the Berlin <b>Blockade.</b>|$|E

50|$|Starting in June, Uruguay demanded {{before the}} Mercosur Tribunal that Argentina {{be punished for}} the <b>blockades,</b> and that it be forced to pay reparations, {{following}} the Treaty of Asunción, which guarantees the free circulation {{of goods and services}} between Mercosur members. On 9 August, Uruguayan representatives presented their claims, centered in two points: first, that the <b>blockades</b> during the summer had caused grave economic damage to Uruguay (calculated in $400 million losses); and second, that the Argentine government did not act to prevent or lift the <b>blockades.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the 19th {{century the}} city was <b>blockaded</b> twice by naval forces: by the French from 1838 to 1840, and later by an Anglo-French {{expedition}} from 1845 to 1848.
