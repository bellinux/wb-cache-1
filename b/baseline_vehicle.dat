40|$|AbstractAs {{a result}} of {{successful}} initiatives in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, {{the introduction of a}} Smart Truck or performance-based standards (PBS) approach in the heavy vehicle sector in South Africa was identified by the CSIR as a research area warranting funding because of the potential benefits in terms of transport efficiency, road/vehicle safety and the protection of road infrastructure. The PBS approach involves setting standards to specify the performance required from the operation of a vehicle on a network rather than prescribing how the specified level of performance is to be achieved. A need was identified to design, manufacture and operate a number of PBS demonstration projects in South Africa in order to gain practical experience in the PBS approach and to quantify and evaluate potential benefits. The Smart Truck demonstration projects have been designed and manufactured to comply with the safety standards of the Australian PBS system. These include directional and non-directional manoeuvres such as acceleration capability, slow speed swept path, static rollover threshold and rearward amplification. In order to evaluate the impact of the PBS vehicles on pavements, the South African Mechanistic-Empirical Design and Analysis Methodology was used to calculate the road wear characteristics of various <b>baseline</b> and PBS <b>vehicle</b> combinations. In most cases, the PBS vehicles were found to be significantly more road-friendly per ton of payload than the corresponding <b>baseline</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Modifications for reducing road wear were identified such as load redistribution {{in order to reduce the}} load on the steering axle, replacing wide-based single tyres with dual tyres and, where appropriate, replacing a single steer axle with a twin steer axle unit. The paper describes the results of road wear analyses of five PBS vehicles and the corresponding <b>baseline</b> <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R

40|$|Hybrid powertrains {{for certain}} heavy {{vehicles}} may improve fuel economy and reduce emissions. Of particular interest are commercial vehicles, typically in Classes 3 - 6, that travel in urban areas. Hybrid strategies and associated energy/emissions benefits for these classes of vehicles could be {{significantly different from}} those for passenger cars. A preliminary analysis has been conducted to investigate the energy and emissions performance of Class 3 and 6 medium-duty trucks and Class 6 school buses under eight different test cycles. Three elements are associated with this analysis: (1) establish baseline fuel consumption and emission scenario's from selected, representative <b>baseline</b> <b>vehicles</b> and driving schedules; (2) identify sources of energy inefficiency from baseline technology vehicles; and (3) assess maximum and practical potentials for energy savings and emissions reductions associated with heavy vehicle hybridization under real-world driving conditions. Our analysis excludes efficiency gains associated with such other measures as vehicle weight reduction and air resistance reduction, because such measures would also benefit conventional technology vehicles. Our research indicates that fuel economy and emission benefits of hybridization can be very sensitive to different test cycles. We conclude that, {{on the basis of}} present-day technology, the potential fuel economy gains average about 60 - 75 % for Class 3 medium-duty trucks and 35 % for Class 6 school buses. The fuel economy gains can be higher in the future, as hybrid technology continues to improve.

In 1997 the initiative was taken for the Auto Oil 2 program, including alternative fuels. The following alternative fuels were investigated: CNG, LPG, DME (di-methyl-ether) FAME 30 % (fatty acid methyl ester), E 85 G (85 % ethanol for Otto engines), E 15 D (15 % ethanol for diesel engines), ETBE (15 % ethyl tertiary butyl ether) and diesel/water emulsion.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to propose a real-time model predictive control (MPC) scheme for the battery thermal management system (BTMS) of given plug-in hybrid electric and electric vehicles (PHEV/EVs). Although BTMS control in its basic form can be well represented by a reference tracking problem, there exists only little research in the literature taking such an approach. Due {{to the importance of}} a prediction component in thermal systems, here the BTMS controller has been designed based on MPC theory to address this gap in the literature. Application of the controller to the <b>baseline</b> <b>vehicles</b> is then examined by several simulations with di erent optimization algorithms. By comparing the results of the predictive controller with those of the standard rulebased (RB) controller over a variety of driving scenarios, it is observed that the predictive controller signi cantly reduces the power consumption and provides a better tracking behaviour. Integrating trip prediction into the control algorithm is particularly important in cases such as aggressive driving cycles and highly variable road-grades, where the standard BTMS scheme does not perform as e ectively due to the load current pro le. Moreover, based on the simulation results, the designed controller is observed to have a turnaround time between 10 s to 1 ms, and is thus applicable to the real-time automotive systems. Prosperity of the proposed BTMS control methodology paves the way for the use of model-based (MB) thermal management techniques, not only in futur...|$|R

The dry weight of a vehicle which incorporates the optimized bulkheads is predicted using a vehicle weights and sizing code. Two optimization approaches are employed. A structural-level method, where the vehicle s three major bulkhead regions are optimized separately and then incorporated into a model for computation of the vehicle dry weight, predicts a reduction of 4365 Ib (2. 2 percent) from the 200, 679 Ib <b>baseline</b> <b>vehicle</b> dry weight. In the second, vehicle-level, approach, the vehicle dry weight is the objective function for the optimization. During the vehicle- level analysis, modified bulkhead designs are first analyzed, then incorporated into the weights model for computation of a dry weight. The optimizer simultaneously manipulates design variables for all three bulkheads to reduce the dry weight. The vehicle-level analysis predicts a dry weight reduction of 5129 Ib, a 2. 6 percent reduction from the baseline value. These results suggest that nontangent, developed contour bulkheads may provide substantial weight savings for SSTO vehicles...|$|E

40|$|Hybrid Laminar Flow Control (HLFC) is {{an active}} drag {{reduction}} technique that permits extended laminar flow on an aircraft surface at chord Reynolds numbers normally associated with turbulent flow. The operational effectiveness of HLFC aircraft relates to {{the probability of a}} partial or complete loss of laminar flow. Four factors were considered: (1) Ice particles in cirrus clouds; (2) Insect contamination; (3) Mechanical failure; and (4) Damage to the suction surfaces. Two computer programs capable of determining the required fuel for a given mission profile have been developed for aircraft in the classes of the B 757 - 200 and the A 330 - 200. The programs were validated against published payload-range data, and modified to emulate the installation of a HLFC system, by incorporating changes to the drag polar, Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) and Operating Empty Weight (OEW). Sensitivity studies were conducted. The results permit estimates to be determined of the trip fuel reduction of HLFC aircraft compared to equivalent turbulent aircraft. A conceptual design of a HLFC system has been developed for the reference aircraft. A SFC penalty of 1. 6 % was determined for the B 757 - 200 class aircraft (range: 3272 nm, payload: 19147 kg) and 2. 1 % for the A 330 - 200 class aircraft (range: 5980 nm, payload: 24035 kg) for a system capable of reducing the drag by approximately 14 %. The installed system weight represents 2. 0 % and 1. 6 % of the OEW for the B 757 - 200 and A 330 - 200 classes of aircraft respectively. The reduction in trip fuel, compared to the turbulent <b>baseline</b> <b>vehicles,</b> was estimated to be 7. 4 % for these conditions. To obtain the greatest benefit for a HLFC aircraft, the fuel planning must consider the probable time-in-cloud that will result in a loss of laminar flow.

The physical variables included built-in rounded front corners, and two different designs of add on flow vanes for the front of box shaped vehicle with 67 deg and 90 deg of arc. For a diesel powered vehicle, only slightly larger than a family van, the built in rounded front corners provide a calculated fuel saving of about 6. 0 liters per hour of driving (1. 6 gallons per hour) at 88. 6 km per hour (55 mph) in national average winds, {{as compared to the}} <b>baseline</b> <b>vehicle</b> having all square corners. The corresponding savings for a <b>baseline</b> <b>vehicle</b> to which front mounted flow vanes were added is competitive. For a gasoline powered vehicle the volumetric fuel savings would be larger by a factor of about 1. 7. The fuel savings for a standard size motor home would be greater for the diesel or gasoline powered vehicles by from 30 to 35 percent because of the larger frontal area. Thus projected fuel savings for a standard size motor home powered by gasoline can approach 12. 5 to 13. 5 liters (3. 3 to 3. 6 gallons) for each hour driving at highway speeds...|$|E

The baseline internal combustion engine is replaced by an overexpanded cycle engine, Wankel engine and microturbine, with respective generator and exhaust after treatment. Weight savings are compensated by introducing additional battery modules, maintaining the original <b>baseline</b> <b>vehicle</b> curb weight. Vehicle Specific Power (VSP) is used for driving cycle analysis and as explanatory variable for energy consumption and CO 2 emissions variations.
