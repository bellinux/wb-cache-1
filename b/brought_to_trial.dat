5|$|On 13 November 1553 Cranmer {{and four}} others were <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> for treason, found guilty, and {{condemned}} to death. Several enemies testified that Cranmer had encouraged heresy and had written heretical works.|$|E
5|$|Around 12 {{percent of}} Auschwitz's 6,500 staff {{who survived the}} war were {{eventually}} <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial.</b> Poland was more active than other nations in investigating war crimes, prosecuting 673 of the total 789 Auschwitz staff <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial.</b> On 25 November 1947, the Auschwitz Trial began in Kraków, when Poland's Supreme National Tribunal brought to court 40 former Auschwitz staff. The trial's defendants included commandant Arthur Liebehenschel, women's camp leader Maria Mandel, and camp leader Hans Aumeier. The trials ended on 22 December 1947, with 23 death sentences, 7 life sentences, and 9 prison sentences ranging from three to fifteen years. Hans Münch, an SS doctor who had several former prisoners testify on his behalf, {{was the only person}} to be acquitted.|$|E
5|$|In the United States on February 21, 1903, New York police {{conducted}} the first recorded raid on a gay bathhouse, the Ariston Hotel Baths. 26 men {{were arrested and}} 12 <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> on sodomy charges; 7 men received sentences ranging from 4 to 20 years in prison.|$|E
50|$|In 1605, Hogenskild Bielke was <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trialed</b> {{for high}} treason and {{executed}} {{on the evidence}} of, among other things, his correspondence with his daughter. Ebba Bielke herself was also arrested, judged as an accomplice in the crimes of her father. Her property was confiscated by the crown and she was sentenced to imprisonment.|$|R

50|$|The West German {{government}} <b>brought</b> Streckenbach <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> in 1973 but {{the case}} was dismissed due to defendant's ill health. He died on 28 October 1977 in Hamburg.|$|R
5|$|Investigators {{found that}} Fall and a {{relative}} {{had received a}} total of about $400,000 from Doheny and Sinclair, and that the transfers were contemporaneous with the controversial leases. Fall was ultimately convicted in 1929 for accepting bribes and, in 1931, became the first U.S. cabinet member to be imprisoned for crimes committed while in office. Sinclair was convicted only of contempt of court for jury tampering. Doheny was <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> before a jury in April 1930 for giving the bribe Fall had been convicted of accepting, but he was acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Germans {{responsible}} for {{the operation of the}} camp were captured and <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial.</b> Several were extradited to Yugoslavia and executed. Camp commander Herbert Andorfer and his deputy Edgar Enge were arrested in the 1960s after many years of hiding. Both were given short prison sentences in West Germany and Austria, respectively, though Enge never served any time given his old age and poor health.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between 343 and 340BC, Neaira was <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> by Theomnestus {{on behalf}} of his {{father-in-law}} Apollodorus, accused of xenias (representing herself as a citizen when in fact she was not). If she was convicted, the maximum penalty Neaira faced was being sold into slavery and having her property sold. Neaira herself would not have been permitted to speak at her trial, though she was probably present.|$|E
60|$|Similar {{alterations}} in the outward figure and deportment of persons <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> like <b>trial</b> were not uncommon. See {{note to the}} above passage in Dr. Wordsworth's Ecclesiastical Biography, for an example in an humble Welsh fisherman.|$|R
2500|$|To attack expert {{testimony}} as inadmissible, counsel may bring pretrial motions, including motions in limine. [...] The motion in limine may be <b>brought</b> prior <b>to</b> <b>trial,</b> although counsel may bring the motion during trial as well.|$|R
50|$|Eustratius had her imprisoned, {{giving her}} time to reconsider, and he {{threatened}} to have her taken to a brothel if she persisted in her disobedience. Three days later, Theodora was <b>brought</b> again <b>to</b> <b>trial,</b> but remained resolute.|$|R
5|$|The Pirates Own Book and Ossian both {{suggest that}} Low was set adrift without {{provisions}} by {{the crew of}} the Merry Christmas, in a mutiny brought about by Low's murdering of a sleeping subordinate following an argument. His crew elected Captain Shipton to command the Merry Christmas; they would go on to sail alongside Spriggs in the Caribbean. Low was subsequently rescued by a French ship; when the French authorities learned of his identity he was <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial,</b> and was hanged in Martinique in 1724.|$|E
5|$|A {{full-size}} {{reproduction of}} September Morn was {{displayed in a}} window of Jackson and Semmelmeyer, a photography shop in Chicago, Illinois, in March 1913. A passing police officer noticed the print and on grounds that it was indecent, insisted it be taken down. The mayor of the city, Carter Harrison, Jr., agreed with the policeman's decision, and deemed that the image could be sold, but should not be displayed in public as children could see it. Fred Jackson, the owner, was charged with indecency, and at his request the case was <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> on March 18.|$|E
5|$|As {{a show of}} {{communist}} rule and Soviet domination, sixteen prominent leaders of the Polish anti-Nazi underground were <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> in Moscow in June 1945. Their removal from the political scene precluded {{the possibility of a}} democratic transition called for by the Yalta agreements. The trial of the defendants, falsely and absurdly accused of collaboration with the Nazis, was watched by British and American diplomats without protest. The absence of the expected death sentences was their relief. The exiled government in London, after Mikołajczyk's resignation led by Tomasz Arciszewski, ceased to be officially recognized by Great Britain and the United States on 5 July 1945.|$|E

60|$|On the Friday I was <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> my <b>trial.</b> I had {{exhausted}} my spirits with {{crying for}} two or three days before, so that I slept better the Thursday night than I expected, and had more courage for my trial than indeed I thought possible for me to have.|$|R
5|$|Assisted by {{a network}} of former SS members, Mengele sailed to Argentina in July 1949. He {{initially}} lived in and around Buenos Aires, then fled to Paraguay in 1959 and Brazil in 1960 while being sought by West Germany, Israel, and Nazi hunters such as Simon Wiesenthal {{so that he could}} be <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial.</b> In spite of extradition requests by the West German government and clandestine operations by the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, Mengele eluded capture. He drowned while swimming off the Brazilian coast in 1979 and was buried under a false name. His remains were disinterred and positively identified by forensic examination in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the {{evidence}} suggests that Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had concentrated consular power largely {{in the hands of the}} Flavian family, Domitian admitted a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, allowing them to head the official calendar by opening the year as an ordinary consul. Whether this was a genuine attempt to reconcile with hostile factions in the Senate cannot be ascertained. By offering the consulship to potential opponents, Domitian may have wanted to compromise these senators in the eyes of their supporters. When their conduct proved unsatisfactory, they were almost invariably <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> and exiled or executed, and their property was confiscated.|$|E
5|$|Shakur {{was acquitted}} after seven hours of jury {{deliberation}} on January 16, 1976, {{and was immediately}} remanded back to New Jersey for the Turnpike trial. The actual transfer took place on January 29. She {{was the only one}} of the six suspects in the robbery to be <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial.</b> Andrew Jackson and two others indicted for the same robbery pleaded guilty; Jackson was sentenced to five years in prison and five years' probation; another was shot and killed in a gunfight in Florida on December 31, 1971, and the last remained at large at the time of Shakur's acquittal.|$|E
50|$|On the way, he {{encountered}} some soldiers who questioned him. Erasmus {{admitted that he}} was a Christian and they <b>brought</b> him <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> at Antioch before the emperor Diocletian. After suffering terrible tortures, he was bound with chains and thrown into prison, but an angel appeared and helped him escape.|$|R
50|$|Lysander's faction at Sparta {{was furious}} {{and along with}} King Agis <b>brought</b> Pausanias <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> <b>to</b> the end of 403 BCE. The exact charge is {{uncertain}} but the essence was presumably {{that he had been}} soft on Athens. Fifteen of the Gerousia, including Agis, voted guilty and 14 against but all 5 Ephors voted non guilty so he was acquitted.|$|R
5000|$|Gaius Manilius, tribune of the plebs in 66 BC, was a {{partisan}} of Gnaeus Pompeius, {{for whom he}} was able to obtain special powers. His enemies among the aristocratic party <b>brought</b> him <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> on an uncertain charge; perhaps extortion, or disturbing another trial. He was defended by Cicero, but to no avail, and was condemned.|$|R
5|$|After the war, Wiesenthal {{dedicated}} most of {{his life}} to tracking down and gathering information on fugitive Nazi war criminals so that they could be <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial.</b> In 1947 he co-founded the Jewish Historical Documentation Centre in Linz, Austria, where he and others gathered information for future war crime trials and aided refugees in their search for lost relatives. He opened the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime in Vienna in 1961 and continued to try to locate missing Nazi war criminals. He played a small role in locating Adolf Eichmann, who was captured in Buenos Aires in 1960, and worked closely with the Austrian justice ministry to prepare a dossier on Franz Stangl, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the writers}} who {{fell victim to}} the regime of Sejanus and its aftermath, were the historians Aulus Cremutius Cordus and Velleius Paterculus and the poet Phaedrus. Cordus was <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> in AD 25 by Sejanus, under accusations of treason. He was charged for having eulogized Marcus Junius Brutus and spoken of Gaius Cassius Longinus {{as the last of}} the true Romans, which was {{considered}} an offence under the Lex Maiestatis; the Senate ordered the burning of his writings. His fall is elaborated upon by Seneca the Younger, in his letter to Cordus' daughter Marcia To Marcia, On Consolation. Seneca tells us that her father most likely incurred Sejanus' displeasure for criticising him because he had commissioned a statue of himself. We also know from this source that Cordus starved himself to death. Marcia was instrumental in saving her father's work so that it could be published again under Caligula.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Kamo, {{none of the}} {{organizers}} of the robbery were ever <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial,</b> and initially it was not clear who was behind the raid, but after the arrest of Kamo, Litvinov and others, the Bolshevik involvement became obvious. The Mensheviks felt betrayed and angry; the robbery proved that the Bolshevik Centre operated independently from the unified Central Committee and was taking actions explicitly prohibited by the party congress. The leader of the Mensheviks, Georgi Plekhanov, called for separation from the Bolsheviks. Plekhanov's colleague, Julius Martov, said the Bolshevik Centre was something between a secret factional central committee and a criminal gang. The Tiflis Committee of the party expelled Stalin and several members for the robbery. The party's investigations into Lenin's conduct were thwarted by the Bolsheviks.|$|E
5000|$|Within {{four years}} of {{the closing of the}} Council, Pope Martin I and Maximus the Confessor were arrested and <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> Constantinople for <b>trial,</b> for violating the Typoss {{prohibition}} on discussing the subject.|$|R
50|$|Two {{years after}} its inception, the case's file had 110 sections, over a {{thousand}} testimonies, and seven accused individuals who awaited the ruling of the Federal Court {{as to whether they}} would be <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> jury <b>trial</b> proceedings. The judge also accepted Nora Nouche, the copilot's partner, as a plaintiff and recognized her as another victim rather than one of the responsible persons.|$|R
50|$|In 1733 {{the fellows}} of Trinity again <b>brought</b> Bentley <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> before {{the bishop of}} Ely (then Thomas Greene), and {{he was sentenced to}} deprivation. The college {{statutes}} required the sentence to be exercised by the vice-master Richard Walker, who was a friend of Bentley and refused to act. Although the feud continued until 1738 or 1740 (about thirty years in all), Bentley remained in his post.|$|R
5|$|At {{some point}} in the coming four years, the Pickingill family moved to Canewdon, where another son, George, was born in 1876. The couple and their four {{children}} were then recorded in the 1871 census, where Pickingill was again listed as working as an agricultural labourer. In the 1881 census, the couple were recorded as living with two of their children, Mary Ann and George, and Pickingill was again identifying as a labourer. On 17 August 1887, a homeless man named James Taylor stole a jacket and pair of leather gloves from Pickingill. Taylor was arrested and <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> in Rochford on 24 August; in October, he pleaded guilty to the theft of the jacket, although not to those of the other items. He was sentenced to six months imprisonment with hard labour.|$|E
5|$|In August 1718, Bonnet {{anchored}} the Royal James on an estuary of the Cape Fear River {{to careen}} and repair the ship. In late August and September, Colonel William Rhett, with the authorization of South Carolina governor Robert Johnson, led a naval expedition against pirates on the river. Rhett and Bonnet's men fought {{each other for}} hours, but the outnumbered pirates ultimately surrendered. Rhett arrested the pirates and brought them to Charles Town in early October. Bonnet escaped on 24October, but was recaptured on Sullivan's Island. On 10November, Bonnet was <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> and charged with two acts of piracy. Judge Nicholas Trott sentenced Bonnet to death. Bonnet wrote to Governor Johnson to ask for clemency, but Johnson endorsed the judge's decision, and Bonnet was hanged in Charles Town on 10December 1718.|$|E
5|$|In May 1960, Isser Harel, {{director}} of Mossad (the Israeli intelligence agency), personally led the successful effort to capture Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires. He hoped {{to track down}} Mengele as well so he too could be <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> in Israel. Under interrogation, Eichmann provided the address of a boarding house {{that had been used}} as a safe house for Nazi fugitives. Surveillance of the house did not reveal Mengele or any members of his family, and the neighborhood postman said that although Mengele had recently been receiving letters there under his real name, he had since relocated, leaving no forwarding address. Harel's inquiries at a machine shop where Mengele had been part owner did not turn up any leads either, so he had to give up.|$|E
50|$|On July 14, 2011 Walton {{declared}} a mistrial over inadmissible evidence shown to jurors. The judge said Clemens {{could not be}} assured a fair trial after prosecutors showed jurors evidence against his orders in {{the second day of}} testimony. Following the mistrial, the US Attorneys Office <b>brought</b> Clemens <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> once more for perjury. On June 18, 2012, Judge Walton accepted the jury's unanimous verdict of acquittal.|$|R

50|$|In 1895, Diokno, {{along with}} Felipe Agoncillo, were prosecuted by civil and ecclesiastical {{authorities}} for obstruction of {{functions of the}} government. On August 29, 1896, Don Fernando Parga y Torriero, military governor of Cavite, had Diokno and other revolutionaries arrested and <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> immediate <b>trial.</b> Prominent citizens who fled to Indang, Cavite established the Regional Government of Batangas with Miguel Malvar as commanding general and Diokno as secretary of war.|$|R
