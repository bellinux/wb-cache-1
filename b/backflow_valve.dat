40|$|Thesis {{describes}} the actual state of low pressure sewer systems designing, basic characteristics of low pressure sewer systems and design basics in Czech republic and abroad {{in accordance with}} czech and european standards. Next part contains description of fittings used in low pressure sewer and emphasizes its key role in design, service and maintenance of the system. Based on gathered informations the fittings calatogue for low pressure sewer networks was created. Followed subjects were closing fittings, backflow valves, cleaning sets and bleeding- and aerating vents.

50|$|Alternatively, a {{specialized}} <b>backflow</b> preventer <b>valve</b> may be installed at strategic {{locations in the}} plumbing system wherever {{there is a risk}} of contaminated fluids entering the water supply pipes. These valves are used where there is not sufficient vertical clearance or physical space to install an air gap, or when pressurized operation or other factors rule out use of an air gap. Because these valves use moving parts, they are often required to be inspected or tested periodically.|$|R
25|$|In the United States, 45% of the 250,000 valve {{replacement}} procedures performed annually involve a mechanical valve implant. The {{most widely used}} valve is a bileaflet disc heart valve, or St. Jude valve. The mechanics involve two semicircular discs moving back and forth, with both allowing {{the flow of blood}} as well as the ability to form a seal against <b>backflow.</b> The <b>valve</b> is coated with pyrolytic carbon, and secured to the surrounding tissue with a mesh of woven fabric called Dacron (du Pont's trade name for polyethylene terephthalate). The mesh allows for the body's tissue to grow while incorporating the valve.|$|R
5000|$|Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), {{also known}} as vesicoureteric reflux, is a {{condition}} in which urine flows retrograde, or backward, from the bladder into the ureters/kidneys. Urine normally travels in one direction (forward, or anterograde) from the kidneys to the bladder via the ureters, with a 1-way valve at the vesicoureteral (ureteral-bladder) junction preventing <b>backflow.</b> The <b>valve</b> is formed by oblique tunneling of the distal ureter through the wall of the bladder, creating a short length of ureter (1-2 cm) that can be compressed as the bladder fills. Reflux occurs if the ureter enters the bladder without sufficient tunneling, i.e., too [...] "end-on".|$|R
25|$|Persistent {{chronic pain}} {{associated}} with non-healing wounds {{is caused by}} tissue (nociceptive) or nerve (neuropathic) damage and is influenced by dressing changes and chronic inflammation. Chronic wounds {{take a long time}} to heal and patients can suffer from chronic wounds for many years. Chronic wound healing may be compromised by coexisting underlying conditions, such as venous <b>valve</b> <b>backflow,</b> peripheral vascular disease, uncontrolled edema and diabetes mellitus.|$|R
50|$|The trabeculae carneae {{also serve}} a {{function}} {{similar to that}} of papillary muscles in that their contraction pulls on the chordae tendineae, preventing inversion of the mitral (bicuspid) and tricuspid valves towards the atrial chambers, which would lead to subsequent leakage of the blood into the atria. By this action on the atrioventricular <b>valves,</b> <b>backflow</b> of the blood from the ventricles into the atria is prevented.|$|R
50|$|The {{heart valves}} and the {{chambers}} {{are lined with}} endocardium. Heart valves separate the atria from the ventricles, or the ventricles from a blood vessel. Heart valves are situated around the fibrous rings of the cardiac skeleton. The valves incorporate leaflets or cusps, which are pushed open to allow blood flow and which then close together to seal and prevent <b>backflow.</b> The mitral <b>valve</b> has two cusps, whereas the others have three. There are nodules at {{the tips of the}} cusps that make the seal tighter.|$|R
25|$|The main {{circulating}} pumps {{have the capacity}} of 5,500–12,000m³/h and are powered by 6kV electric motors. The normal coolant flow is 8000m³/h per pump; this is throttled down by control valves to 6000–7000m³/h when the reactor power is below 500MWt. Each pump has a flow control <b>valve</b> and a <b>backflow</b> preventing check <b>valve</b> on the outlet, and shutoff valves on both inlet and outlet. Each of the pressure channels in the core has its own flow control valve so that the temperature distribution in the reactor core can be optimized. Each channel has a ball type flow meter.|$|R

50|$|On {{the morning}} of Monday, September 25, 2006 over 300,000 gallons of water was {{discovered}} {{in the basement of}} Klein Elementary School. The cause was attributed to debris in the public water system that found its way into the <b>backflow</b> prevention <b>valve</b> located just inside of the building. While the valve functioned properly, due to its location within the building, it was left in an open position for an estimated 55 hours which was more than enough time to fill the basement. For an unknown reason, the circuit breakers did not trip, and when the water submerged all of the electrical panels, the electricity flow heated the water to about 105 degrees. As a result, all of the equipment in that area was destroyed, submerged under 14 feet of water. The building was immediately closed, and remained closed for about one month, while the students were moved to Rolling Ridge Elementary (K-4th grades) and the Junior High School (5th and 6th grades). The cost to the school district was nearly $250,000 to replace the destroyed equipment. Through the cooperation of area contractors, the building was able to reopen on Monday, October 23, 2006.|$|R
5000|$|Technological advancements {{within the}} {{industry}} allow for incorporating timers to limit the operations during specific {{hours of the day}} to reduce energy waste by only operating when occupants are likely to use hot water. Additional advancements in technology include pumps which cycle on and off to maintain hot water temperature versus a continuously operating pump which consumes more electrical energy. Reduced energy waste and discomfort is possible by preventing occurrences of hot water line siphoning in open-loop hot water circulation systems which utilize the cold water line to return water back to the water heater. Hot Water Line Siphoning occurs when water from within the hot water line siphons or is forced into the cold water line due to differences in water pressure between the hot and cold water lines. Utilizing [...] "normally closed" [...] solenoid valve significantly reduces energy consumption by preventing siphoning of non-hot water out of hot water lines during cold water use. Using cold water instantly lowers the water pressure in the cold water lines, the higher water pressure in the hot water lines force water through [...] "normally open" [...] thermostatic crossover <b>valves</b> and <b>backflow</b> check <b>valves</b> (which only prevent cold water from flowing into hot water line), increasing the energy demand on the water heater.|$|R
40|$|SummaryHalorhodopsin is a light-driven {{chloride}} anion pump {{in which}} the trans→cis photoisomerization of a retinal chromophore triggers a photocyle resulting in the translocation of chloride across the plasma membrane. The mechanism of chloride transfer past the cis retinal is determined here by computing multiple pathways for this process. The calculations reveal two conditions of the valve mechanism. First, a lumen absent in the ground state structure is transiently opened by chloride passage. Second, this activated opening, {{which is achieved by}} flexible deformation of the surrounding protein, is shown to significantly raise the chloride translocation barrier between photocycles, thus preventing chloride <b>backflow.</b> Unlike macroscopic <b>valve</b> designs, the protein allows differential ion flows in the pumping and resting states that are tuned to match the physiological timescales of the cell, thus creating a “kinetic” valve...|$|R
40|$|Variable {{camshaft}} phasing (VCP) {{system is}} a potential valvetrain technology for high speed engine applications since it does not increase the effective valve dynamic mass, which is essential to high speed operation. In addition, it is a relatively simple and low cost system. Inlet Valve Opening (IVO) {{is the start of}} valve overlap. It has significant effect on engine breathing. As part of a general assessment on the VCP system, such an effect was calculated and analysed using a zero- and one- dimensional based commercial engine simulation package, Lotus Engineering Simulation (LES) and reported in this paper. The simulation was based on a 0. 6 l, 4 -cylinder, 4 -stroke, high speed (up to 13500 rpm), production spark ignition engine. It was found that IVO can either improve the utilisation of inlet charging effect or reduce <b>backflow</b> during the <b>valve</b> overlap period caused by speed related wave effects from the exhaust manifold...|$|R
30|$|Feed tank (position 1) is {{containing}} {{about three}} liters of diesel {{with the total}} sulfur content of 6380  ppm. After using any appropriate membrane, the remaining diesel is poured inside the feed tank and the feed will be replaced with new diesel to experiment with new membrane. In position 2, the pump has been used that leads diesel with different flow rates and pressures set (5 – 9 times) into the membrane module (position 5). Membrane modules is manufactured from stainless steel and membranes used with active area of 2100  cm 2. The pressure gauges represents (position 4 and 6) the diesel and backflow pressures, respectively. Needle valves are installed at 7 positions to control the <b>backflow</b> and a <b>valve</b> is inserted in position 3 for the input flow to the module. The membranes in the input feed to the modulus to be kept wet approximately 1  h {{before the start of}} each test to achieve steady state conditions. For each test approximately 3  h were taken and the operating temperature range is between 65 and 85  °C.|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis deals with the hydraulics of heating systems. The aim of the project is a design of the heating and hot water preparation system for an apartment building. The building has 6 above-ground floors and 2 underground floors. Two different options of heating systems were designed, comparison and results are presented in the thesis. In the first case the heat source during the winter season and for water heating, where chosen two gas condensing boilers, situated in separated room on the second underground floor. In the second case, each apartment has its own gas condensing boiler. The experimental {{part of the project}} deals with measurements of pressure losses in water armatures used in heating systems. The aim of this part is the determination of coefficients of added resistance for uncontrolled elements, which are normally presented as tabular value.

Measurements for thermostatic valve where done with different settings and results are compared with parameters listed in the datasheet...|$|R
40|$|The {{variation}} of refrigerant {{mass in the}} cylinder of refrigerator compressor has a great influence on the compressor’s thermodynamic process. In this paper, the m-θ diagram, which represents the {{variation of}} refrigerant mass in compressor cylinder (m) and the crank angle (θ), is proposed to investigate the thermodynamic process of the refrigerator compressor. Comparing with the traditional pressure-Volume (p-V) indicator diagram, the refrigerant’s backflow trigged by the delayed closure of valve can be clearly expressed in the m-θ diagram together with the mass flow rate. A typical m-θ diagram was obtained by experimental and theoretical investigations. To improve the thermodynamic model of the compressor, a 3 D fluid-structure interaction (FSI) FEA model has been introduced {{to find out the}} effective flow area of the valves. Based on the m-θ diagram, the effect of rotating speed on the <b>backflow</b> through the <b>valve,</b> which depends on the movement of the valve, has been investigated. Specific to the compressor used in this study, the maximum backflow through the suction valve and discharge valve occur at 3500 r·min− 1 and 5500 r·min− 1, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Mitral valve {{prolapse}} {{without proper}} monitoring {{might lead to}} a severe mitral valve failure which eventually leads to a sudden death. Additional information on the mitral valve leaflet condition against the backflow volume would be an added advantage to the medical practitioner for their decision on the patients' treatment. A study on two dimensional echocardiography images has been conducted and the correlations between the backflow volume of the mitral regurgitation and mitral valve leaflet Young modulus have been obtained. Echocardiogram images were analyzed on the aspect of backflow volume percentage and mitral valve leaflet dimensions on different rates of backflow volume. Young modulus values for the mitral valve leaflet were obtained by using the principle of elastic deflection and deformation on the mitral valve leaflet. The results show that the backflow volume increased with the decrease of the mitral valve leaflet Young modulus which also indicate the condition of the mitral valve leaflet approaching failure at high <b>backflow</b> volumes. Mitral <b>valve</b> leaflet Young modulus values obtained in this study agreed with the healthy mitral valve leaflet Young modulus from the literature. This is an initial overview of the trend on the prediction of the behaviour between the fluid and the structure of the blood and the mitral valve which is extendable to a larger system of prediction on the mitral valve leaflet condition based on the available echocardiogram images...|$|R
40|$|This effort {{presents}} {{the need for}} advanced combustion modes such as PCCI for use in heavy-duty diesel engines, {{as a means to}} meet the strict future pollutant emission and fuel efficiency regulations imposed by the federal government. The state of the art in literature is reviewed for PCCI combustion, combustion timing prediction and modeling, and limitations on the PCCI operating range. The author 2 ̆ 7 s specific contributions are outlined, including testbed development, development of a control-oriented PCCI combustion timing model, analysis of the limitations on the PCCI operating range and technologies to improve them, and support for the other efforts within the research group, as all will be combined to enable successful closed-loop control of PCCI combustion. ^ The PCCI combustion timing model is a simple, analytical, control-oriented model for prediction of combustion timing during premixed charge compression ignition combustion with early fuel injection. The model includes direct dependence on in-cylinder temperature, in-cylinder pressure, and the total in-cylinder O 2 mass fraction, including the contribution of EGR, residual burned gas, and <b>backflow</b> during the <b>valve</b> overlap period. The model is extensively validated against experimental PCCI data from a multi-cylinder diesel engine utilizing high pressure EGR, variable geometry turbocharging, and flexible intake valve actuation, which allows control over the engine 2 ̆ 7 s effective compression ratio. The results show that across a wide range of input conditions the model predicts the start of combustion within ± 2 °CA of the experimental values for all but three of the 180 data points (98...|$|R
