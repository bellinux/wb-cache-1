David Hinkley of the New York Daily News rated it four stars out of five, stating it is [...] "a little cartoonish {{in the same}} way Seagal or Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies were cartoonish, exaggerating characters and action.

Some critics, including former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, charged that the number had been tampered with in order to benefit Obama one month before the U.S. presidential election. [...] Solis said, [...] "I'm insulted when I hear that <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very professional, civil service organization where you have top, top economists that work at the BLS. They've been doing these calculations. These are our best trained and best-skilled individuals working in the BLS, and it's really ludicrous to hear that kind of statement."

500|$|A film {{based on}} the Runaways went {{through a number of}} iterations. Brian K. Vaughan was {{originally}} hired to write a screenplay {{based on the}} property in May 2008. In April 2010, Marvel hired Peter Sollett to direct the film, and Drew Pearce was hired to write a script in May. The following October, development on the film was put on hold, with Pearce revealing in September 2013 that the Runaways film had been shelved in favor of The Avengers, with the earliest it could release being Phase Three. In October 2014, after announcing all of Marvel's Phase Three films without Runaways, Feige stated the project was [...] "still an awesome script that exists in our script vault", adding, [...] "We'd love to do something with Runaways some day. In our television and future film discussions, it's always one that we talk about, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> solid draft there. But again, we can't make them all."

500|$|The {{title of}} [...] "Compass Point", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a {{reference}} to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was [...] "Back to Earth", {{and was the first}} song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, [...] "There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so we went back to that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it’s just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it’ll be done.' That of course was not the case, and we ended basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves." [...] Frankel called the EP's closer, [...] "Footsteps", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was [...] "Your Favorite Band/Footsteps". As Frankel described coming up with the name, [...] "I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. When I was there, I overheard some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they’re DJing,' and that’s something that happens all the time now. People go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it’s a DJ set. I thought it was kind of funny, and also kind of sad — but in a funny way." [...] While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; [...] "We’re still messing around, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of demos from this last year and a half, and we’re sifting through, figuring out if there’s one more we want to finish." ...|$|E

[...] "If you've been listening to the last All albums, you could tell that we were pointing in this direction anyhow," [...] said Alvarez, [...] "and I think there's some staggeringly un-commercial songs on this record—songs like `Uncle Critic' and `Hetero', which don't fit into the cutesy-pie-punk routine that the radio's so enamored with right now. But we've always done stuff that might be considered more commercial than a lot of our peers have done, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> certain regard for pop construction and harmonies and things like that." ...|$|E

[...] "It was pretty much the same with the last record," [...] bassist Jon Walker said. [...] "We haven't stopped writing songs since we stopped recording Pretty.

[...] "We've got quite a few new ideas and songs we've been working on, and we're hoping to record some of that stuff {{by the end of the}} year." [...] The article explained that Walker said the band would be taking time off for the holidays and then re-entering the studio to record new music. In June 2009, singer Brendon Urie revealed the band had been writing for [...] "roughly half a year now" [...] at Ross' Topanga Canyon, California home, and continued to take the band [...] "further down the sun-dappled, retro-pop path [...] began exploring on Pretty.

[...] Spencer Smith, drummer, added, [...] "We moved to California since the last record, so that's inspiration. We started surfing, too, so maybe we'll get a little Beach Boys vibe on this one."
