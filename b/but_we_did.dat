25|$|Geronimo {{was raised}} with the {{traditional}} religious views of the Bedonkohe. When questioned about his views on life after death, {{he wrote in his}} 1905 autobiography, As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to what part of man lived after death... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not know it.|$|E

Berg had been midway through filming The Kingdom {{when he heard about}} the film and called Michael Mann, who had become one of its producers. The new director compared the original script's tone to Leaving Las Vegas (1995), calling it [...] "a scathing character study of this suicidal alcoholic superhero". The director explained the rewrite, [...] "We thought the idea was cool, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> want to lighten it up. We all did." [...] Before filming began, Tonight, He Comes was retitled John Hancock, and it was eventually shortened to Hancock.|$|E

So they’d single him out. But the truth was, {{it was pretty much}} everybody. I {{definitely}} had my hand firmly on the wheel going off the cliff. And the reason we pulled back – you know when you stop when you have two #1 records, it’s not really the greatest career move – <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> that because we love each other and we didn’t want to die in public.

500|$|Daft Punk {{produced}} the tracks included in Homework without {{a plan to}} release an album. Bangalter stated, [...] "It {{was supposed to be}} just a load of singles. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> so many tracks over a period of five months that we realized that we had a good album." [...] The duo set the order of the tracks to cover the four sides of a two-disc vinyl LP. De Homem-Christo remarked, [...] "There was no intended theme because all the tracks were recorded before we arranged the sequence of the album. The idea was to make the songs better by arranging them the way we did; to make it more even as an album." [...] The name Homework, Bangalter explained, relates to [...] "the fact that we made the record at home, very cheaply, very quickly, and spontaneously, trying to do cool stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|Together {{with the}} other clubs playing in European competitions, Arsenal entered the Football League Cup in the third round. The team were drawn to face First Division Stoke City, on the week of 21 October 1996. The tie ended 1–1 and was subject to a replay; Wright {{equalised}} for Arsenal after Mike Sheron gave Stoke a first half lead. Arsenal won the replay by five goals to two, but exited the cup in the fourth round against league rivals Liverpool – the result {{marked the first time}} in four years that Arsenal had conceded four goals. Wenger described Bould's dismissal for a second bookable offence as [...] "hard", before congratulating his opponents: [...] "Liverpool are the best team we have played against since I've been at Arsenal.

[...] Epstein then supposedly said, [...] "Would you find it embarrassing if I ask you {{to stay in a}} hotel overnight?" [...] Best replied that he was not interested, and the two never mentioned the incident again. There were reports of a brief sexual encounter between Lennon and Epstein during a four-day holiday in Barcelona, in April 1963. Lennon always denied the rumours, telling Playboy in 1980: [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated... <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> have a pretty intense relationship." [...] Lennon's first wife Cynthia also maintains that Lennon's relationship with Epstein was platonic. A fictionalised account of the Spanish holiday is featured in the 1991 film The Hours and Times.|$|E

As tradition ever since, Arsenal goalkeepers have always washed their jerseys before each game.

We did our very utmost to prevent them from doing so, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not succeed. As, however, the trophy is gone to Cardiff, there is no one who more heartily congratualtes them than the captain of the losers.

[...] With no response from Oxford, Cambridge extended their advantage further to around two lengths by Barnes Bridge, a lead which they held at the finishing post in a time of 19 minutes 1 second. [...] They secured their third consecutive victory and their ninth win in eleven years and taking the overall record in the race to 5745 in their favour. [...] At the post-race dinner, held at the Royal Automobile Club in Pall Mall, the Oxford boat club president Carnegie defended his crew's style: [...] "The style was all right <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not match up to it".

A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really– maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely." [...] When asked about the King's Cross scene {{near the end of the}} film, Craig said, [...] "We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white– so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research." ...|$|E

[...] Guard later told journalist Richard Hadlock in Down Beat magazine: [...] "We are not students of folk music; the basic thing for us is honest and worthwhile songs that people can pick up and become involved in." [...] Nick Reynolds added in the same article: [...] "We don't collect old songs {{in the sense that}} the academic cats do... We get new tunes to look over every day. Each one of us has his ears open constantly to new material or old stuff that's good." [...] Bob Shane remarked years later: [...] "To call the Kingston Trio folksingers was kind of stupid in the first place. We never called ourselves folksingers... We did folk-oriented material, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it amid all kinds of other stuff. But they didn't know what to call us with our instruments, so Capitol Records called us folksingers and gave us credit for starting this whole boom." ...|$|E
500|$|Sveriges Radio {{stipulated that}} the work had to include a Swedish element. Singer Russell Mael told The National, [...] "At first, we {{obviously}} thought of cars and Ikea. I'm joking. But the more profound, more lasting idea – being the film fans we are – was Ingmar Bergman. So we hit upon a fantasy situation of him going to Hollywood, which is obviously a lot more universal, too." [...] Before starting work on the musical, the Mael brothers decided to refresh their memories by looking at Bergman's films again. [...] "We were both really big film fans in university. At that time unless you only liked foreign film, and hated American ones, you weren't cool", Ron Mael told The Times. [...] "There was a real kind of seriousness to [...] He actually addressed big things {{and was able to}} frame those in really pure, cinematic ways. Now those things are seen as being kind of pretentious. Everyone wants to be seen as though they don't care about the big issues." [...] Commenting on the suitability of Bergman as the topic of a musical, Russell Mael told a Swedish newspaper, [...] "In a way, he is the least appropriate person for a musical. We like the absurdity of it all. He was such a deep, intense person {{and the vast majority of}} his films are about really deep topics. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not want to ridicule him, we wanted to do something respectful that Bergman would have been able to appreciate." ...|$|E

Playing amiable pig farmer [...] "Pig" [...] Finn brought Nesbitt to international attention, particularly in the United States (where the film was released as Waking Ned Devine); the cast was nominated for the 1999 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Theatrical Motion Picture. In 1999, he appeared as the paramilitary [...] "Mad Dog" [...] Billy Wilson in The Most Fertile Man in Ireland (Dudi Appleton). The following year, he appeared in Declan Lowney's feature debut, Wild About Harry. Lowney had personally asked him {{to appear in the}} supporting role of cross-dressing Unionist politician Walter Adair. In 2001, he made his debut as a lead actor in a feature film in Peter Cattaneo's Lucky Break. He played Jimmy Hands, an incompetent bank robber who masterminds an escape from a prison by staging a musical as a distraction. On preparing for the role, Nesbitt said, [...] "Short of robbing a bank there wasn't much research I could have done <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> spend a day in Wandsworth Prison and that showed the nightmare monotony of prisoners' lives. I didn't interview any of the inmates because I {{thought it would be a}} little patronising as it was research for a comedy and also because we were going home every night in our fancy cars to sleep in our fancy hotels." [...] The film was a commercial failure, despite receiving good feedback from test audiences in the United States.|$|E
500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get out there in the world... it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".|$|E
