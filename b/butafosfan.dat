40|$|The use of <b>butafosfan</b> in {{combination}} with cobalamin modulates many cellular metabolic functions in several species. Its use enhances productive and reproductive performance and reduces stress responses in animals. Despite all these attributes, so far {{there have been no}} controlled studies to evaluate the effects of <b>butafosfan</b> and cobalamin on the quality of stallion semen. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the action of <b>butafosfan</b> {{in combination}} with cobalamin on the quality of fresh and cooled stallion semen. Four healthy stallions were kept in the same place and under the same management conditions during the entire experiment. Stallions were randomly assigned to two treatment groups in a 2 x 2 crossover design. Group A stallions were treated with an intramuscular injection of <b>butafosfan</b> twice a week for 80 days, while group B did not receive any treatment. After that, both groups were not treated for another 80 days allowing a washout period for the treated group. Then, the groups were reversed, and group B was treated with <b>butafosfan</b> and group A acted as the control for another 80 days. Semen was collected twice a week, diluted in skim milk and evaluated for total sperm count, total and progressive sperm motility, membrane integrity (CFDA/PI staining) and membrane functionality (HOS test) at 0 and 24 hours after preservation at 5 ºC. Data were analyzed by comparing the values obtained from the treated stallions between the 60 th and 84 th days of treatment and the values obtained from the same stallion during the control period. The ejaculates of the washout period and between days 1 and 63 of treatment were not considered. A total of 85 ejaculates were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Means were compared by the Tukey test at the 5...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the efficacy of}} <b>Butafosfan,</b> a component of Catosal®, in the metaphylactic treatment of stress in pigs. Four 6 -week-old female littermates were taken from 12 litters. They were confronted with a pig from a different litter for 2 h. There were 24 pairs, each consisting of confronting two unfamiliar pigs in a new pen. This housing of unfamiliar pigs provides a good, but simple, model of the psychosocial stress that pigs experience when housed in large groups on pig farms. Immediately before being housed with an unfamiliar pig, 12 pairs of pigs were injected subcutaneously with Catosal® at a dose equivalent to 20 mg <b>Butafosfan</b> per kg body weight; the other 12 pairs received the control solution containing all ingredients of Catosal® except <b>Butafosfan.</b> The frequency and duration of aggressive behavior and the salivary cortisol response were measured during the first 2 h of the encounter. No adverse effects associated with Catosal® were observed. Subcutaneous injection of Catosal® reduced the stress-induced salivary cortisol response {{and the frequency of}} aggressive behavior evoked by the social stress of housing two unfamiliar pigs together...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the effect of combined <b>butafosfan</b> and cyanocobalamin on liver metabolism in early lactating cows through mRNA expression measurements of genes encoding 31 enzymes and transport proteins of major metabolic processes in the liver using 16 multiparous early lactating dairy cows. The treatments included i. v. injection of 10 mL/ 100 kg of body weight combined <b>butafosfan</b> and cyanocobalamin (TG, n = 8) on 3 d consecutively at 25 +/- 3 d in milk or injection with physiological saline solution similarly applied (CG, n = 8). Results include a higher daily milk production for TG cows (41. 1 +/- 0. 9 kg, mean +/- SEM) compared with CG cows (39. 5 +/- 0. 7 kg). In plasma, the concentration of inorganic phosphorus was lower in the TG cows (1. 25 +/- 0. 08 mmol/L) after the treatment than in the CG cows (1. 33 +/- 0. 07 mmol/L). The plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration was 0. 65 +/- 0. 13 mmol/L for all cows before the treatment, and remained unaffected post treatment. The unique result was that in the liver, the mRNA abundance of acyl-coenzyme A synthetase long-chain family member 1, involved in fatty acid oxidation and biosynthesis, was lower across time points after the treatment for TG compared with CG cows (17. 5 +/- 0. 15 versus 18. 1 +/- 0. 24 cycle threshold, log(2), respectively). In conclusion, certain effects of combined <b>butafosfan</b> and cyanocobalamin were observed on mRNA abundance of a gene in the liver of nonketotic early lactating cows...|$|E
40|$|As vacas leiteiras s??o desafiadas a desempenhar o m??ximo da sua capacidade produtiva, principalmente, durante o per??odo de transi????o (tr??s semanas anteriores e tr??s semanas posteriores ao parto). Este per??odo ?? caracterizado por intensas mudan??as no metabolismo que causam um balan??o energ??tico negativo. Este fato gera uma perda de peso caracter??stica do per??odo, que tem sido correlacionada com a resist??ncia perif??rica ?? {{insulina}}, haja vista, que a glicose dispon??vel esta sendo destinada para s??ntese de lactose, que por sua vez ?? respons??vel, parcialmente, pelo volume de leite produzido. Al??m disso, durante a lacta????o h?? v??rios manejos que podem oferecer risco ?? sa??de dos animais, caso n??o sejam executados adequadamente, causando traumas e predispondo o animal a infec????es, especialmente, da gl??ndula mam??ria, j?? que ela ?? intensamente manipulada e tem contato com v??rios agentes potencialmente infecciosos. A partir de uma porta de entrada estes agentes podem infectar a gl??ndula causando a mastite, que pode se apresentar na forma cl??nica (com presen??a de sinais cl??nicos), ou subcl??nica (sem sinais cl??nicos). Nas situa????es de desequil??brio metab??lico, ou em casos de mastite, a produ????o de leite pode ser prejudicada. Diante disso, h?? uma busca constante por tecnologias que possam minimizar estes transtornos e auxiliar os sistema de produ????o. Nosso objetivo foi verificar o efeito da associa????o de <b>butafosfan</b> e cianocobalamina sobre o metabolismo glic??mico de vacas leiteiras saud??veis no per??odo p??s-parto, al??m dos seus efeitos sobre a recupera????o da gl??ndula mam??ria em vacas leiteiras ap??s o tratamento de mastite cl??nica. Para tanto, nosso estudo foi estratificado em dois trabalhos com as seguintes hip??teses: 1) a utiliza????o da associa????o de <b>butafosfan</b> e cianocobalamina pode intensificar a resist??ncia ?? insulina perif??rica, disponibilizando maior quantidade de glicose para a produ????o de leite em vacas leiteiras; 2) a suplementa????o da associa????o de <b>butafosfan</b> e cianocobalamina pode auxiliar na recupera????o da gl??ndula mam??ria de vacas leiteiras, ap??s o tratamento da mastite cl??nica. No experimento 1, os animais que receberam sucessivas doses de <b>butafosfan</b> e cianocobalamina tiveram maior perda de peso e aumento (P 0, 05). Os animais tratados com <b>butafosfan</b> e cianocobalamina apresentaram menor (P 0, 05) entre os grupos. Nessas condi????es de estudo, podemos concluir que a associa????o de <b>butafosfan</b> e cianocobalamina apresenta resultados promissores como fonte de nutriente que permite intensificar as rea????es fisiol??gicas, principalmente, as dependentes de fosforila????o. Dairy {{cows are}} expected to perform maximum of their productive capacity, especially during the transition period (three weeks before and up to three weeks after calving). This period is characterized by intense changes in metabolism which cause a negative energy balance. This fact generates a period of typical weight loss, which has been correlated with insulin resistance, once the available glucose is destined for lactose synthesis, {{which in turn is}} responsible, in part, for milk production levels. Moreover, during lactation there are several managements that impairs animals health. If not executed properly, can cause trauma and predisposition for infections, especially of the mammary gland, because this gland is heavily manipulated and has contact with potentially infectious agents. From a entrance doorway, these agents can infect the gland and cause mastitis, which may be clinical (with clinical signs) or subclinical (without clinical signs). In situations of metabolic disorders or in cases of mastitis, the milk production may be affected. Therefore, there is a constant search for technologies that can minimize these disorders and assist the production systems. Our objective was to investigate the effects of combining butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin on the glycemic metabolism in healthy dairy cows in the postpartum period and their effects on the mammary gland recovery in dairy cows after clinical mastitis treatment. Thus, our study was stratified into two assumptions: 1) the use of the association of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin enhances peripheral insulin resistance in dairy cows, providing greater amounts of glucose for milk production, 2) the supplementation with butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin facilitates mammary gland recovery in dairy cows affected by mastitis. In experiment 1, animals receiving repeated doses of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin had greater weight loss and increased (P 0. 05) in any parameters. The animals treated with butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin had lower (P 0. 05) among groups. In concusion, the combination of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin shows promising results as a source of nutrient that allows intensify physiological reactions mainly dependent phosphorylation...|$|E
40|$|The article {{gives the}} results of the {{research}} on the influence of a developed complex liposomal preparation on the dynamics of morphological and biochemical indicators of the blood of rats subjected to modeled oxidative stress caused by intermuscular injection of 50 % carbon tetrachloride at a dose of 0. 25 ml per 100 g of body mass. We found that in conditions of intoxication by carbon tetrachloride, the physiological level of hematological indicators of the researched animals’ body was disrupted. This is indicated by the reduction in the amount of erythrocytes, hemoglobin content, concentration of hemoglobin per erythrocyte, increase in the amount of leucocytes, mass of hemoglobin per erythrocyte and increase of colour indicator. Also, we detected suppression of protein synthesis function of the liver. The levels of total protein and albumin fraction were below the normal physiological level. High indicators were observed in the levels of creatinine, urea and total bilirubin. In order to normalize the functional state of the liver under oxidative stress it is reasonable to use a liposomal preparation which contains <b>butafosfan,</b> interferon, thistle and vitamins. In order to normalize morphological and biochemical indicators of the blood of rats subject to intoxication of carbon tetrachloride it is reasonable to use a liposomal preparation that contains <b>butafosfan,</b> selenium, thistle, methionine and vitamins. Using the liposomal preparation Butaselmevit for rats under oxidative stress the morphological and biochemical indicators in the blood normalized. On the 14 th day the indictors of the number of erythrocytes, the hemoglobin content, the white blood cell count and red blood indexes compared to control came within the physiological indicators, indicating a recovery of hematopoietic function of the bone marrow and normalized indicators of the functional state of the liver...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the results of search of the {{influence}} of developed complex liposomal drug on dynamics of hematological parameters of rat organisms under conditions of simulated oxidative stress caused by the use of carbon tetrachloride. Intramuscular injection of 50 % tetrachloromethane to rats at a dose of 0. 25 ml per 100 g of body weight causes antigenic load on the body and leads to disruption of physiologic level of hematological indices of experimental animal organisms. This indicates the number reduce of red blood cells, hemoglobin content, hemoglobin concentration in erythrocyte, increasing the number of leukocytes, mass of hemoglobin in erythrocyte and increased of color index. To normalize the hematological indices of rat organisms for the development of oxidative stress it is advisable to apply the liposomal drug that incorporates contains <b>butafosfan,</b> interferon, milk thistle and vitamins. When using liposomal drug to rats, under conditions of oxidative stress, the normalization of hematological indices comes in blood, namely on 14 th day within physiological variables were indicators of the number of erythrocytes of hemoglobin content, white blood cell count and indices of red blood cells compared to controls, indicating a recovery of hematopoietic function of marrow...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of investigation of the impact of stress on oxidative intensity of lipid per oxidation. It was proved that intramuscular injection of 50 % solution of tetrachloromethane at a dose of 0. 25 mL per 100 g of rat body causes the activation of free radical lipid oxidation with excessive accumulation of intermediate and final products of lipid peroxidation. Our results indicate that the development of oxidative stress leads to the significant acceleration of the formation and accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides and malondialdehyde (MDA) in plasma of rats. We registered the highest level of lipid hydroperoxides in rat blood plasma under oxidative stress {{on the second day of}} the experiment; it was 0. 843 un/mL, whereas this index was 0. 245 un/mL in the control group. We also revealed that the content of malondialdehyde was the highest in the experimental group on the fifth day of the experiment; it was almost 2 times higher than in control group. We could recommend to apply the liposomal drug "Butaselmevit" which contains <b>butafosfan,</b> selenium, methionine, milk thistle, and vitamins for the inhibition of lipid peroxidation under the development of oxidative stress. It was proved that the parenteral injection of liposomal drug "Butaselmevit" to the rats for the development of oxidative stress leads to a reduction of peroxidation products level in their plasma. We revealed that the level of intermediate and final products of lipid peroxidation in the blood of rats that were used liposomal drug reached normal physiological values on the 14  day of the experiment. Our results suggested that the new liposomal drug "Butaselmevit" has definite antioxidant propertie...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of research into the influence of the complex liposomal preparation Butaintervit on protein synthesis function in the livers of rats under the influence of carbon tetrachloride poisoning. Intramuscular injection of carbon tetrachloride into rats at a dose of 0. 25 ml per 100 gof body weight causes antigenic load on the body and leads to disruption of protein synthesis function in the liver. This is shown by reduction in blood levels of total protein and its fractions. Thus, the level of albumin in the serum of rats under the conditions of oxidative stress was 70 % lower than in clinically healthy animals. However, the level of total protein in the serum was only 10 % lower. This is because, along with the decrease of albumin content in the serum, the levels of globulin protein fraction increased by 8. 8 %. This has led to albumin/globulin disparities in the serum of sick animals. As a result, the value of A/G coefficient was 0. 28 ± 0. 03, compared to 0. 52 ± 0. 02 inclinically healthy rats. For the normalization of functional state of the liver under oxidative stress it is advisable to apply the liposomal preparation Butaintervite, which in its structure contains <b>butafosfan,</b> interferon, thistle and vitamins A, D and E. Under conditions of oxidative stress and under the action of the liposomal preparation in the rats from the second experimental group we have found significant increase in the levels of total protein and albumins and a decrease in serum globulin in the animals on the fifth and tenth days of the experiment. On the fourteenth day of the experiment under the conditions of oxidative stress and under the action of the liposomal preparation in the rats from the second experimental group the normalization of protein synthesis function in the liver was observed. The level of indicators of total protein, albumin, globulin and the coefficient of albumin/globulin compared with the control group of animals were within normal values...|$|E
