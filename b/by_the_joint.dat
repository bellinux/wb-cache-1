5|$|As {{indicated}} in the table below, each basin uses a separate system of terminology, which can make comparisons between different basins difficult. In the Pacific Ocean, hurricanes from the Central North Pacific sometimes cross the 180th meridian into the Northwest Pacific, becoming typhoons (such as Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke in 2006); on rare occasions, the reverse will occur. It {{should also be noted}} that typhoons with 1-minute sustained winds greater than 67 metres per second (m/s), over , are called Super Typhoons <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The passive dynamic walker (PDW) has a remark-able {{characteristic}} that it realizes cyclic locomotion without planning <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> trajectories. However, it cannot control the walking behavior {{because it is}} dominated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fixed body dynamics. Observing the human cyclic locomotion emerged by elastic muscles, we add <b>the</b> compliant hip <b>joint</b> on PDW, and we propose a “phasic dynamics tuner ” that changes <b>the</b> body dynamics <b>by</b> tuning <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> compliance {{in order to control}} the walking behavior. <b>The</b> <b>joint</b> compliance is obtained <b>by</b> driving <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> utilizing antagonistic and agonistic McKibben pneumatic actuators. This paper shows that PDW with <b>the</b> compliant <b>joint</b> and <b>the</b> phasic dynamics tuner enhances the walking performance than present PDW with passive free <b>joints.</b> <b>The</b> phasic dynamics tuner can change <b>the</b> walking velocity <b>by</b> tuning <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> compliance. Experimental results show the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> compliance and <b>the</b> phasic dynamics tuner. I...|$|R

At 03:00UTC on May10, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported the formation of a depression about 535km (330mi) west of Banda Aceh, Indonesia. Within nine hours, the depression further intensified into a deep depression.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 11named storms, there were two additional storms in the season, classified <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). The first developed in July in the Australian basin, and briefly crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean on July14. Soon after it re-entered the Australian basin and dissipated. The other formed just southeast of Diego Garcia on November20. It tracked to the southwest, and the JTWC estimated peak 1minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph). The storm dissipated on November25 northeast of Mauritius. In addition, Cyclone Daryl, which formed in the Australian basin on March6, crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean on March16 as a weakening storm without being renamed. Two days later it re-entered the Australian basin before dissipating.|$|E
5|$|In late July2003, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather {{began to}} persist northwest of Chuuk in the Philippine Sea, and was first noted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) early on July30. As atmospheric conditions remained favorable throughout the day's duration, the system organized, and was upgraded to tropical depression status by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration(PAGASA) at 0600UTC on July31, followed by the JTWC at 0600UTC and Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) six hours later. The PAGASA consequently named the system Juaning for local purposes. Tracking north-northwestward {{under the influence of}} a passing trough, the system intensified further into a tropical storm by 0600UTC on August2, thus receiving the name Morakot.

30|$|The power {{consumption}} of the physical robot is estimated based on the current {{consumption of the}} robot, which comprises <b>the</b> current drawn <b>by</b> <b>the</b> servo motors and also all additional electronic components in <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> modules. Hobby servo motors of the kind used in the robot (Hitec HSR 5990 TG) draw {{a significant amount of}} current (e.g., due to high resistance in the internal gear train) even when there is no load on the motor shaft. For this reason, the measured current does not provide an accurate quantitative estimate of the mechanical work carried out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> on <b>the</b> environment of the robot. In particular, <b>the</b> current drawn <b>by</b> <b>the</b> physical robot constitute a significantly higher {{power consumption}} than the power consumption corresponding to the mechanical work carried out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints.</b> <b>The</b> measured current does, on the other hand, provide a qualitative estimate of the mechanical work since <b>the</b> current drawn <b>by</b> <b>the</b> servo motors will increase when the loads on <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> increase. For this reason, the power consumption of the physical robot (based on current measurements) will be significantly higher than the power consumption of the simulated snake robot, which is calculated based on <b>the</b> simulated <b>joint</b> torques, thereby providing accurate calculations of the simulated mechanical work. For the results presented in Figs. 15 and 16, we are therefore able to obtain only a qualitative (and not quantitative) comparison of the power consumption of the simulated and the physical robot.|$|R
