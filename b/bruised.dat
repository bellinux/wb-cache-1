40|$|Simulating {{the spatial}} and {{temporal}} behavior of <b>bruises</b> may identify methods that allow accurate age determination of <b>bruises</b> to assess child abuse. We developed a numerical 3 D model to simulate the spatial kinetics of hemoglobin and bilirubin during the formation and healing of <b>bruises.</b> Using this model, we studied how skin thickness, <b>bruise</b> diameter and diffusivities affect the formation and healing of circular symmetric <b>bruises</b> and compared a simulated <b>bruise</b> with a natural inhomogeneous <b>bruise.</b> Healing is faster for smaller <b>bruises</b> in thinner and less dense skin. The simulated and natural <b>bruises</b> showed similar {{spatial and temporal}} dynamics. The different spatio-temporal dynamics of hemoglobin and bilirubin allows age determination of model <b>bruises.</b> Combining our model predictions with individual natural <b>bruises</b> may allow optimizing our model parameters.

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} to compare different methods to measure <b>bruise</b> susceptibility of fruit. In order to compare measured values with actual commercial <b>bruising,</b> an appropriate test method to simulate impact damage during handling was developed, employing a revolving tumbler. From the analysis of <b>bruise</b> damage produced by the tumbler on four apple cultivars under different storage treatments, {{it was found that}} a large percentage of <b>bruises</b> were less than 1. 5 cm in area, and the number of <b>bruises</b> above 1. 5 cm did not change between treatments. It was concluded that laboratory measurements involving high impact energy levels may be insensitive as indicators of <b>bruising</b> levels on fruit during commercial operations. The impact loads produced by this method was very similar to those incurred by a practical grader, as indicated by Instrumented Sphere measurements. The tumbler test permitted examination of actual grader damage relationships with standard tests. Three standard impact tests (vertical drop test, double and single pendulum test) were conducted on four cultivar apples: Splendour, Granny Smith, Pacific Rose, and Braeburn. Four different shapes of impact surface were used for each impact test. It was found that <b>bruise</b> susceptibility varied with different impact tests. Regression analysis was made on the data obtained from standard impact tests and tumbler test to find the correlation between the <b>bruise</b> susceptibility and the <b>bruise</b> area/apple. <b>Bruise</b> susceptibility obtained from the vertical drop test using the hockey ball was closely related to the <b>bruise</b> area per apple produced by the tumbler test (R = 0. 72). The <b>bruise</b> factor obtained from the single pendulum test using the flat indenter also showed a correlation with the <b>bruise</b> area per apple produced by the tumbler test (R = 0. 78). However, the <b>bruise</b> susceptibility produced by the double pendulum test and single pendulum test was not well correlated with the <b>bruise</b> area/apple and <b>bruise</b> number/apple produced by tumbler test. The <b>bruise</b> susceptibility produced by using the pyramid indenters from three standard impact tests was not well correlated with the <b>bruise</b> area per apple and the number of <b>bruises</b> per apple produced by the tumbler test. <b>Bruise</b> susceptibility, <b>bruise</b> area, and the shape of the <b>bruise</b> depended upon the shape of the indenter used for the experiment and the method used to conduct the impact tests. Splendour, Granny Smith and Pacific Rose all had similar <b>bruise</b> susceptibilities, but Braeburn was significant less susceptible to <b>bruising.</b> Generally, <b>bruise</b> susceptibility increased with storage time in all cultivars. Apples stored in a low humidity environment (65 % RH) generally had lower <b>bruise</b> susceptibilities after 2 months storage for the flat and hockey ball indenters but not for pyramid indenters on Splendour and Braeburn apples, when compared with 90 % RH storage. <b>Bruise</b> susceptibilities at 0. 5 ° C were higher than at room temperature. Fruit firmness also decreased with storage time. <b>Bruise</b> shape depended upon the indenter surface shape. The flatter indenters produced <b>bruises</b> which were less deep than the hockey ball and pyramids. The <b>bruise</b> shape was elliptical for the flat plate, a circle for the hockey ball, and a rhombic for the pyramid indenters. There was no cracking below the <b>bruise</b> region for any apples when the flat plate indenter was used in the three standard impact tests. However cracks were found below the <b>bruise</b> region in Splendour, Pacific Rose, and Braeburn apple (but not for Granny Smith apples) when any pyramid indenter was used. The pyramid indenters produced a more linear relationship between a 2 / 3 power impact energy and <b>bruise</b> area (without skin removal) than either a spherical or a flat indenter. <b>Bruise</b> visibility depended on the impact surface shape and energy levels. Some <b>bruise</b> produced from standard impact tests, when the flat indenter used, were not visible unless the apple skin was removed. Braeburn required a greater impact energy to produce an initial <b>bruise</b> than other cultivars. Once <b>bruising</b> began the visibility of <b>bruising</b> increased with an increase in energy levels...|$|R

40|$|Apple <b>bruising</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{problems}} causing loss of apple quality during harvesting and post-harvesting process. The degree of <b>bruising</b> may be described by <b>bruise</b> surface or volume, but manual measurement of these variables is tedious and often inaccurate. Image analysis techniques could be more accurate and reliable. This study was therefore designed as part of a project to develop a semi-automatic system to determine apple <b>bruise</b> size, by establishing an effective method of image analysis for measuring apple <b>bruises</b> in the laboratory. Systems for image analysis of apple <b>bruises</b> were set up using the VIPS (Vision Image Processing System) computer language, a program developed at Massey University. <b>Bruises</b> on fresh and stored "Granny-Smith" apples were made using a falling pendulum, and steel and hockey balls dropped vertically in a series of experiments. Parameters such as <b>bruise</b> width and depth in the <b>bruise</b> cross-section were measured by traditional manual methods and compared with semi-automatic image analysis values. The surface <b>bruise</b> area was also measured by both methods. <b>Bruise</b> volume assessments were made both by estimation from single cross-sections and by taking several cross-sections through the <b>bruise</b> and measuring their thickness. In order to test repeatability of the measurement technique, apple <b>bruises</b> were measured by independent assessors and their results were compared with image analysis data. <b>Bruise</b> width and depth measurements from a radial cross section were the same for the manual method and image analysis. <b>Bruise</b> volumes calculated from these two methods by assuming a geometric shape also gave similar results, regardless of the way in which the <b>bruise</b> was made. However, the standard deviation of <b>bruise</b> volume among the replicates technique from the image analysis was half that for the manual measurement method. Direct measurement of the <b>bruise</b> surface area (after skin removal) by image analysis was five times less variable than by manual measurement. The manual method, however, consistently overestimated <b>bruise</b> area by 10 % compared with the image analysis. An improved method to estimate <b>bruise</b> volume using image analysis is proposed, which does not require a geometric shape of the apple <b>bruise</b> to be assumed. This involves taking a series of sections parallel to the skin. This method was more amenable to image analysis techniques and appears to be more accurate than the traditional manual radial cross-section method for <b>bruise</b> volume assessment...|$|R
40|$|AIM—To {{obtain a}} {{prevalence}} rate {{and determine the}} distribution of accidental <b>bruising</b> in babies.  METHODS— 177 babies aged 6 - 12 months were examined naked to look for <b>bruises.</b> They were seen in health visitor hearing test clinics and child health surveillance clinics. The site, size, shape, and colour of <b>bruises</b> were recorded on a skin map, and the parent's explanation noted. Any other injury was recorded. Data collection included the baby's age, mobility and weight, demographic details, and health visitor concerns.  RESULTS—Twenty two babies had <b>bruises,</b> giving a prevalence rate of 12 %. There was a total of 32 <b>bruises,</b> 15 babies had one <b>bruise.</b> All <b>bruises</b> {{were found on the}} front of the body and were located over bony prominences. Twenty five of the <b>bruises</b> were on the face and head, and seven were on the shin. The babies with <b>bruises</b> on the shin were mobile. There was a highly significant increase in <b>bruises</b> with increase in mobility.  CONCLUSIONS—The study has produced a prevalence and distribution of <b>bruising</b> in babies and sets a baseline from which to work when assessing <b>bruises.</b> It also tested out the methodology, which could be used in further research, particularly of younger babies. Clinicians need to assess a baby's level of development when considering whether a <b>bruise</b> is accidental. ...|$|R

40|$|In Chile, cow {{carcasses}} {{present the}} highest <b>bruise</b> prevalence {{compared with other}} cattle categories; however, {{the causes of the}} <b>bruises</b> are frequently unknown.

After slaughter, number of <b>bruises,</b> location on the carcass and characteristics of the <b>bruises</b> were assessed. Seventy-eight <b>bruises</b> were observed on 37 carcasses. Fifty-two <b>bruises</b> were linked back to their causal event. Results showed that 46 % of these <b>bruises</b> were a result of interactions between animal and facility, and most of them were inflicted in the stunning box, 27 % of the <b>bruises</b> originated from animal–animal interactions and were mostly inflicted during lairage, another 27 % was a result of human–animal interactions and were mostly inflicted during loading and unloading of animals. The percentages of potential <b>bruising</b> events resulting in a <b>bruise</b> were 43 %, 9 % and less than 1 % for animal–facility, human–animal and animal–animal interactions, respectively. Most <b>bruises</b> on the back site were inflicted when the animal was in the stunning box (91. 2 %), whereas <b>bruises</b> on the pin site were mostly (75 %) inflicted during loading at the farm. One may conclude that in relative short journeys (= 4 h) directly from farm to the slaughterhouse and long lairage times (> 12 h), most <b>bruises</b> are the result of circumstances at the slaughterhouse. A substantial amount of these <b>bruises</b> could be avoided by proper animal handling and adequate stunning facilities...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The aims of {{this study}} were (A) to {{investigate}} whether the number of years of forensic experience affected the accuracy with which forensic experts (FEs) were able to age <b>bruises</b> and (B) to identify the properties and colours of a <b>bruise</b> that were utilized by FEs in their assessment of <b>bruise</b> age. The study then investigated the possibility of using a more objective technique. It was decided to use readily available digital photography and software to objectively assess changes in <b>bruise</b> colouration and to investigate if this can be used to age <b>bruises.</b> Methods: Twenty-three FEs were shown 25 photographs of <b>bruises</b> of varying but known ages and asked to estimate the ages. In part two of the study, <b>bruises</b> were inflicted on volunteers using a vacuum pump and photographs taken of the <b>bruise</b> daily from infliction to resolution. The images were analysed using Adobe Photoshopw.

Results: This study both enhanced and supported a previous conclusion that visual assessment of photographs is an unreliable method for ageing <b>bruises.</b> Additionally, it found that the degree of forensic experience had no effect on accuracy. It also identified that colour (particularly yellow, red and purple) and intensity of colour were the most commonly used properties of a <b>bruise</b> in the assessment of its age.

40|$|Background/Aim. Bone <b>bruise</b> is {{a common}} finding in acutely injured knee {{examined}} by magnetic resonance (MR). The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the association of bone <b>bruise</b> frequency with postinjury lesions of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and menisci. Bone <b>bruise</b> involves posttraumatic bone marrow change with hemorrhages, edema and microtrabecular fractures without disruption of adjacent cortices or articular cartilage. MR imaging is a method of choice for detecting bone <b>bruises</b> which can not be seen on conventional radiographic techniques. Methods. A representative review of 120 MR examinations for the acute knee trauma was conducted. All the patients were examined within one month of trauma. All MR examinations were performed by using a 0. 3 T MR unit. Results. Posttraumatic bone <b>bruise</b> was seen in 39 (32. 5 %) patients out of 120. Three patients had fracture of the cortex, so-called “occult” fracture (not seen on plain radiography). We analyzed only bone <b>bruises</b> without these fractures of the cortex. Bone <b>bruise</b> was associated with the lesion of ACL in 27 (69 %) patients. In 28 (72 %) patients bone <b>bruise</b> was in combination with the lesion of menisci. Only two patients with bone <b>bruise</b> had neither ACL nor menisci lesions. There were 78 patients without bone <b>bruise</b> but 33 (43 %) of them had lesions of ACL and 49 (63 %) had lesions of menisci. Conclusion. Bone <b>bruise</b> is best seen in STIR (Short TI Inversion Recovery) images and is very often found in acute knee trauma. Very often it is associated with posttraumatic lesions of ACL and menisci, so attention must be paid to this when bone <b>bruise</b> is seen. The difference in frequency of internal structures of the knee lesions in patients with bone <b>bruise</b> is highly statistically significant as compared to patients with no bone <b>bruise...</b>|$|R
