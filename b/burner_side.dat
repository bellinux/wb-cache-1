50|$|The flame-grilling {{machine at}} Burger King, Carl's Jr./Hardee's, and other fast food {{restaurants}} {{is called a}} 'broiler'. It works by moving meat patties along a chain conveyor belt between top and bottom <b>burners,</b> grilling both <b>sides</b> of the meat patty at the same time. This concept was invented in 1898, when the Bridge and Beach Co. of St. Louis, Missouri, started manufacturing a vertical cast iron stove. These stoves were designed to allow the meat to be flame-broiled (flame-grilled) on both sides at the same time. Custom hinged steel wire gridirons were built {{for use in the}} vertical broilers. The hinged gridirons were slid {{in and out of the}} stoves holding the meat while it cooked evenly on both sides, like modern day oven racks. These stoves took up a small amount of counter space. They were used in lunch spots to feed factory workers.|$|R
40|$|For a {{reheating}} furnace, {{an analysis}} of thermal efficiency depends on precise investigations of the combustion and flow characteristics inside a furnace. Especially, the flow field of the hot gas has significant influence on heating slabs. The slabs are heated up to the temperature over 1500. K, and then they are transported to the rolling mill. The heating efficiency is affected by many factors, such as fuel type, locations of both slabs and burners, thermal properties of slabs, geometry of slab supporting systems, and so on. In the paper, some {{efforts were made to}} simulate the thermo-fluid mechanical phenomenon inside the furnace. The slab heating characteristics in the reheating furnace were investigated by using the finite-volume method (FVM). The unsteady calculation was performed to obtain the temperature distribution by considering the movement of the slabs in the reheating furnace. To treat radiation emitted by the walls and the gas, numerical simulations were completed by employing ANSYS FLUENT. The configurations of skid posts and beams were also considered to evaluate the effect of the burner position. Results indicate that the case with 6 <b>side</b> <b>burners</b> has a higher heating efficiency both in the heating and soaking sections...|$|R
40|$|Pollutant {{emissions}} restrictions {{have driven}} gas turbine manufacturers to employ {{new technologies and}} to operate these systems in extreme operating conditions. These operating conditions produce in some cases combustion instabilities which can have dramatic effects for the turbine. Extended experimental and numerical studies are then required to analyze the possible behavior of the end design. Unfortunately tests on the real set-up are not possible and simplified cases are used. Although gas turbines can contain up to 30 burners blowing into the same annular chamber, tests in laboratories are often performed on one single burner. This simplification obviously suppresses two mechanisms: burner/burner interaction {{and the possibility of}} acoustic azimuthal modes of the full annular chamber. The objective of this thesis is to use Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to investigate whether these mechanisms are important or not. An additional issue considered is the effect of the pilot fuel injection on flame stability. First, the influence of a pilot flame on the flame stabilization of a laboratory scale burner is studied. Then, using a numerical method developed during this thesis, the impact of an azimuthal mode on a turbine is analyzed using single burner LES. A LES of a triple burner configuration is presented and the impact of the <b>side</b> <b>burners</b> on the central burner analyzed. To finish, the feasibility of full chamber LES is demonstrated...|$|R
30|$|The 16 CFR 1633 {{regulation}} {{defines the}} resistance of mattresses to open flame ignition sources. Prior {{to the introduction of}} 16 CFR 1633 in 2007, the Cal TB 603 (Table 1) was adopted in the state of California and regulated by the Bureau of Electronic and Appliance Repair, Home Furnishings and Thermal Insulation (BHFTI). The fire behavior aspects that are generally examined for an open flame ignition test include the heat release rate (HRR), the time and level of the peak heat release rate (PHRR), the total heat released (THR), the rate of flame spread, and the mass loss a specified time period (Table 1). Mattresses or bedding assemblies are placed on top of a large load cell during the flammability test to measure sample weight as a function of time. The test method described in 16 CFR 1633 uses dual T-shaped propane burners with a heat flux of 65 [*]kW/m 2 and 45 [*]kW/m 2 for top and <b>side</b> <b>burners</b> respectively. The top surface of the mattress is exposed to the burner for 70 seconds, and the side is exposed for 50 seconds. The ignition source was designed and developed by NIST (Ohlemiller et al. [2000]; Ohlemiller [2003]) to replicate the impact of burning bedclothes on mattresses. The test criteria are that the THR shall not exceed 15 [*]MJ for the first 10 [*]min of the test, and that the PHRR shall not exceed 200 [*]kW {{at any time in the}} 30 minute test. Heat release rate is measured by oxygen consumption calorimetry, either in an open hood environment or inside a room.|$|R
40|$|One of the IM tests {{described}} in STANAG 4439 is the Fast Cook-off (FCO) test. The Liquid Fuel or External Fire, Munition Test Procedures is {{described in}} STANAG 4240 : “The objective of the selected fuel fire test is {{the determination of the}} reaction and time to reaction of the munition(s) when subjected to a liquid fuel fire environment”. However, {{there is a lot of}} discussion about this typical test. The drawback of the fuel fire test is the pollution of the environment during burning, as a result of the soot and many other substances in the fuel. Therefor a group of international experts is evaluating the use of propane as an alternate fuel for the Fast Heating Test Procedure identified in STANAG 4240 during a series of Fuel Fire Expert meetings (FFE). In the Netherlands the number of polluting large fuel fire test per year is limited but also the performance of the Dutch small fuel fire test leads to pollution and gives an undesirable situation. This is the reason that, in cooperation with the Knowledge Center of Weapons & Munitions of the Dutch MoD, also TNO has developed and tested a clean FCO test setup, based on propane. In the last IMEMTS conference the set-up was described and the results of several tests series, including a calibrating test series in co-operations with the US laboratories NSWC and NAWC, was presented. Since then, the set-up has been improved with respect to safety and several tests series have been performed to increase the hearth of the fire and improve the temperature distribution over the hearth. Also the heating of none cylindrical items such as munition boxes has been improved. The gas flow of the set-up is now remote controlled for safety reasons during live munition testing. The number of burners has been increased, up to 24 burners can now be used. Four relative expensive piezo-burners are used for ignition while the other have replace by cheaper burners without piezo-igniters. Also, the set-up of the burners has been changed; two lines of <b>burners</b> per <b>side</b> have been made, one pointing on the bottom of the tested item and one somewhere around the middle. This increases the hearth of the fire and the improves temperature distribution around the item. Now up to 10 cm below and above the test item, the temperatures are well above the 800 °C. One of the main advantages of this set-up is that burning is so clean that the fire is totally transparent and all items can be filmed during testing. With the new set-up and with the small fuel fire test a series of tests with live munitions has been performed. The results of the pre-test with the mock-ups, the results and comparison of the two tests series with live munition as well as the lessons learned from these tests series will be presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the design, the main {{characteristics}} and the automation systems of innovative autonomous ground mobile units (GMU) for physical weed control (PWC) in maize are described. The machine {{will be created}} within {{the activities of the}} European Project RHEA (Robot fleets for Highly Effective Agriculture and forestry management), that aims to produce different prototypes of autonomous terrestrial and aerial robot able to perform several activities related to the general crop protection in different agricultural scenarios. The first autonomous ground unit machine was designed in order to perform a mechanical and thermal treatment removing weeds from the inter-row crop space and applying in-row selective and precision flaming by means of two crossed LPG rod burners. By means of some modifications of the tools {{it will be possible to}} realize also an autonomous unit for the precision broadcast flaming application. In this case the design involves a replacement of the mechanical tools working in the inter-row space with 50 cm wide burners able to perform flaming at different intensities according to weed cover detected by the perception system of the robot. The working width of both the PWC machines will be of 4. 5 m, thus covering five entire maize inter-row spaces of 0. 75 m each and 2 half inter-row space of 0. 375 m each. The correct position of the tools (mechanical and thermal) will be guaranteed by an automatic precision guidance system connected and supervised to an image based row detection system. Each working elements will be provided by two crossed 0. 25 m wide rod <b>burners,</b> hitting one <b>side</b> of each crop row. The flame should hit the weeds growing in the “inrow” space (a 0. 25 m wide strip of soil with the maize plant in the middle). Regarding the control of the weed emerged in the “inter-row” space each working unit of the will be provided with rigid tools (one central foot-goose and two side “L” shaped sweeps). The mechanical treatment will be performed, independently from the weed presence, as hoeing is a very important agronomical practice. On the contrary, broadcast flaming in the inter-row space will be performed after weed detection, using three different LPG pressures and doses according to weed cover (no weed cover-no treatment, weed cover between 0 and 25...|$|R
40|$|Boilers of KVGM and PTVM {{series are}} {{characterized}} by high values of NO x  and CO content in the combustion products. Reduction of NO x  and CO content {{can be achieved by}} two ways: by installing the condensing heat recovery unit at the boiler outlet and by improving the heat and mass transfer processes in boiler furnaces. Application of the condensing heat recovery units causes pollution of resulting condensate by low-concentration acids. The authors conducted a study {{in order to determine the}} effectiveness of the previously applied methods of suppressing the emission of nitrogen oxides in the boilers of these types. Equalization of the temperature field and, consequently, enhancement of heat transfer in the furnace by substitution the used burners by the more advanced ones, the design of which facilitates reduction the emission of nitrogen oxides, were applied to all the upgraded facilities. The studies fulfilled demonstrate that a reduction of NO x  emissions in water-heating high power boilers is fairly possible by means of modernization of the latter. The authors have developed the project of the PTVM- 30 boiler modernization, which was implemented at a large boiler plant in the city of Vinnitsa (Ukraine). The project included a number of technical solutions. Six burners were replaced by the two ones that were located in the hearth; also the hearth screen was dismantled. At the same time, reducing the total surface area of the heating caused by the exclusion of hearth screen was compensated by filling the locations of the six embrasures of staff <b>burners</b> on the <b>side</b> screens with straightened furnace tubes. Installing the burners separate from the screen made it possible to eliminate the transfer of vibration to the furnace tubes, and – via them – to the boilers setting. Automation provided “associated regulations”. Draught machines were equipped with frequency regulators. During commissioning of the boiler the studies were carried out that related to the identification of dependency of the emission level on the shape of the temperature field in the furnace, in particular, – on the intensity of twist of gas-air mixture at the exit from the burner. We studied two extreme cases, i. e. the case of the maximum achievable level of burner twist that is equal to 45 ° and the case of no twist. As a result of experiments, it was observed that if a decrease of the twist rate takes place the emission of nitrogen oxides is reduced. The methods of further reduction of emissions of nitrogen oxides have been determined, viz. the device recirculation of flue gases by mixing them in a blast air; conducting the process at low excess of air with controlled chemical underburning when complete oxidation of carbon to CO 2  accomplishes outside the furnace at the initial section of the convection part; hydration of blowing air into the humidification amount of 1. 5 – 2. 0 % of the nominal output of the boiler. </p...|$|R
