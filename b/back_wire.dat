5000|$|A seabed tractor {{belongs to}} the {{remotely}} operated underwater vehicle class, although their operations and the handling of these units are quite different. They can be put into use for submarine cable laying or completion of a bury operation. A typical operation involves the seabed tractor being lowered onto the seabed over the pipeline when the location has been confirmed. The weight of the tractor remains mostly on the gantry, being controlled by heave-compensation gear on the gantry. Only about 40 tonnes of the weight should rest on the seabed. The position reference of the vessel is now transferred to the trim-cube sensors on the seabed tractor support wires, which remain vertical. The position of the vessel is now being controlled by {{the movements of the}} tractor, with the trim¬cube feeding <b>back</b> <b>wire</b> angle data to the DP system. The DP, in turn, is correcting the position of the vessel {{in order to keep the}} tractor wires vertical. The DP system would be configured with the centre of rotation located on the trencher. Reading can thus be adjusted according to the environment or any other constraints.|$|E

40|$|Periodontally Accelerated Osteogenic Orthodontics (PAOO), a {{patented}} technique by the Wilcko brothers {{has become}} very popular in reducing the treatment time in Orthodontics. A 17 -year-old male patient presented to the Department with a Class I skeletal and a Class I dental pattern with bilateral canine impactions. The canine impaction was buccal {{on the right side}} (13) and palatal on the left side (23). The initial treatment plan was to disimpact 13 with a piggy <b>back</b> <b>wire</b> and 23 using the K 9 spring respectively and it did not involve the PAOO Technique. However, six months into treatment, the patient stopped reporting for his regular appointments and reported after a time interval of one and a half years to continue his treatment. At the time of his return, considerable bone loss around the region of 23 was noticed on radiographs. The PAOO technique was therefore, carried out to augment bone around 23 as well as reduce the time for treatment...|$|E

50|$|ElectricalThis is cabling {{installed}} {{from the}} electrical switchboard {{to the light}} fitting or any other device {{that is to be}} controlled by the automation system. For example, if you have four down lights in a room and you wish to control each light individually, then each light will be <b>wired</b> <b>back</b> using electrical cabling back to the electrical switchboard. This means you will have four electrical cables installed from the electrical switchboard to the location where the light fittings will be installed. Each cable will be a three core active, neutral and earth cable.If in that room you also have a free standing lamp plugged into a power point and you also want to control this from your automation system, you will need to have that power point individually <b>wired</b> <b>back</b> to the electrical switchboard.So if you want to individually control every light fitting and every power point or power outlets then each one of these devices must be individually <b>wired</b> <b>back</b> to the electrical switchboard. As you can see this start to become quite a lot of electrical cabling so planning is essential.|$|R
