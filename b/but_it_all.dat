I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> ended up working out.|$|E

500|$|About 30 peoplewhom Walsh {{described}} [...] "...seemed to {{be thrilled}} {{to work on}} the show"worked on the making of the episode over at Screen Novelties. Walsh described the initial stage of production as [...] "a very busy period for all of us ... We came in at about 8:30 in the morning and didn't leave until midnight some days. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> zipped by pretty quickly." [...] He said that they [...] "felt pretty lucky because usually executives involved with productions look at the stop-motion process as annoying, but on this special, they were very jazzed and gung-go about it."

500|$|Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph said, [...] "The {{brilliance}} of Barfi! is that it’s no story and all storytelling. It’s about a {{director at the}} top of his game orchestrating terrific talent into a bravura crescendo. Only someone who has showed death the door can open windows to life like this." [...] Filmfare gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "Barfi! is that rare film that can make you smile and make you cry in the same scene. Its technical brilliance is only outdone by its emotional complexity and depth. Pritam's music adds a nice silent-era charm to this already fantastic story, making it an occasion when words simply aren’t enough." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com has given 3.5/5 stars and wrote, [...] "Barfi! is a well-crafted script with an intriguing back-and-forth narrative <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> goes south towards the end." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{persistence}} of such attitudes {{was fueled by}} resentment {{over the fact that}} Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers. Into the 21st century, the notion that Presley had [...] "stolen" [...] black music still found adherents. Notable among African American entertainers expressly rejecting this view was Jackie Wilson, who argued, [...] "A lot of people have accused Elvis of stealing the black man's music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from Elvis." [...] And throughout his career, Presley plainly acknowledged his debt. Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, [...] "Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that. People have been adding to it, adding instruments to it, experimenting with it, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> boils down to [...]" [...] Nine years earlier, he had said, [...] "Rock 'n' roll has been around for many years. It used to be called rhythm and blues." ...|$|E
500|$|Feige {{announced}} that the film was in active development at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International during the Marvel Studios panel, with an intended release date of August 1, 2014. He stated that the film's titular team would consist of the characters Star-Lord, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, Groot, and Rocket Raccoon. Two pieces of concept art were also displayed, one of Rocket Raccoon, and one featuring the entire team. In August 2012, James Gunn entered talks to direct the film, beating out other contenders, including Peyton Reed and the duo Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden. The Avengers director Joss Whedon, who signed a deal to creatively consult {{on all of the}} films leading up to , was enthusiastic about the selection of Gunn to direct, saying [...] "James [...] is what makes me think it will work...

500|$|Though {{considering}} the game [...] "pretty darn tough," [...] IGN praised the game's variety and length. It also praised {{the sound and}} graphics, though the latter {{was a source of}} criticism: [...] "Incomings got it all... <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> comes at a high price: getting this game to run on our PCs was one big pain in the butt." [...] Despite calling it [...] "an outstanding-looking and great playing game," [...] IGN only gave the game a [...] "decent" [...] review score because of the system problems. Conversely, GameSpot's review noted none of these hardware issues, praising the visuals as [...] "some of the finest... of any action game". The reviewer, however, described the game design as [...] "strong yet slightly flawed... definitely pulls you in, but leaves a little to be desired as far as keeping you there," [...] complaining that [...] "what [...] have presented gets tiresome quickly." [...] The publication summarised the game as [...] "a fine game and a definite must-have for arcade fans... What it lacks is a realization that computer games have moved beyond this simplistic style of gameplay".|$|E
500|$|James Panero, {{reviewer}} for The New York Times, called Street Gang a [...] "behind {{the lens}} story" [...] and the [...] "first comprehensive account" [...] of Sesame Street. [...] Panero found Davis' history tireless, but objected to Davis' emphasis on unimportant details. [...] As a result, {{and due to}} Davis' inclusion of every anecdote and biography of everyone involved with its creation and history, Panero considers the book an oral history rather than a tightly organized narrative. [...] Other reviewers note that Street Gang is too much like its subject, episodic and unfocused. [...] Diana Wagman of The L.A. Times states that Davis choice of what to focus on is odd; for example, {{there is a great}} deal of focus in the book on things like the licensing and merchandising agreement of the Muppets, but very little attention on Mississippi's 1970 ban of the show. [...] Wagman states, [...] "Yes, we get a little past-tense womanizing, a lot of drinking and a psychotic breakdown later in the book, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> seems sad, not salacious, and not germane to the basic story". [...] Nick Gillespie of The Washington Post agrees. [...] He calls Jim Henson, who is mentioned often in the book, [...] "an almost completely enigmatic character".|$|E
500|$|Presley and Linda Thompson {{split in}} November 1976, {{and he took}} {{up with a new}} girlfriend, Ginger Alden. He {{proposed}} to Alden and gave her an engagement ring two months later, though several of his friends later claimed that he had no serious intention of marrying again. Journalist Tony Scherman writes that by early 1977, [...] "Presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self. Hugely overweight, his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested, he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts." [...] In Alexandria, Louisiana, the singer was on stage for less than an hour and [...] "was impossible to understand". Presley failed to appear in Baton Rouge; he was unable to get out of his hotel bed, {{and the rest of the}} tour was cancelled. Despite the accelerating deterioration of his health, he stuck to most touring commitments. In Rapid City, South Dakota, [...] "he was so nervous on stage that he could hardly talk", according to Presley historian Samuel Roy, and unable to [...] "perform any significant movement." [...] Guralnick relates that fans [...] "were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> seemed to go right past Presley, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his spiritualism books." [...] A cousin, Billy Smith, recalled how Presley would sit in his room and chat for hours, sometimes recounting favorite Monty Python sketches and his own past escapades, but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions that reminded Smith of Howard Hughes. [...] "Way Down", Presley's last single issued during his lifetime, came out on June 6. On the next tour, CBS filmed two concerts for a TV Special, Elvis in Concert, to be aired in October. On the first of these, captured in Omaha on June 19, Presley's voice, Guralnick writes, [...] "is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project." [...] He did better on the second night, two days later in Rapid City: [...] "He looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too", though his appearance was still a [...] "face framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks." [...] His final concert was held in Indianapolis, Indiana at Market Square Arena, on June 26.|$|E

2500|$|Netanyahu's father, Benzion, was a {{professor}} of Jewish history at Cornell University, editor of the Encyclopaedia Hebraica, and a senior aide to Ze'ev Jabotinsky, who remained active in research and writing into his nineties.
