5|$|During Brawls development, Sakurai briefly {{considered}} adding Miis as playable characters. However, due {{to concerns}} about the Miis' lighter tone not meshing with that of Brawl or potential associations with bullying, he ultimately decided against it. Miis would later <b>be</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> series as playable characters in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.|$|E
5|$|There is {{an option}} on the ship to include surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAM). But it is unclear as to which SAM will <b>be</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Kamorta-class corvette. Options include Barak 1 and the Barak 8. The corvette can hold one helicopter, which currently is an Westland Sea King Mk.42B helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Brooke's {{appointment}} {{coincided with}} more trained men and better equipment becoming available. Under Brooke, new strategies and tactics were devised. More concentration {{was placed on}} defending the coastal crust, while inland a hedgehog defence strategy of defended localities and anti-tank islands was established, each having all-round defence. Many of these anti-tank islands were established along the already constructed stop lines, where existing defences could <b>be</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> new strategy and, especially, at towns and villages {{where there was a}} Home Guard to provide personnel.|$|E

5|$|Experts {{estimate}} {{that with the}} accession of Armenia, the internationally unrecognised Nagorno-Karabakh Republic would not <b>be</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Eurasian Union. Armenia is a permanent political, military and economic ally of Russia, whereas Azerbaijan holds close ties with the west. The Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed concern in 2013 that no reliable customs border between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh could be drawn. However, Nazarbayev expressed that he holds all the existing disagreements preventing Armenia's integration into Eurasian Economic Union are surmountable. The Chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee in the Armenian Parliament, Artak Zakarian, announced on 14 May 2014 that Armenia will build no customs border including the region of Nagorno-Karabakh.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to improving the}} economy, the lower social classes also had to <b>be</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> new body politic, although they often got few rewards from independence. The political debate seeking {{answers to these questions}} was marked by a clash—at times on the battlefield—between liberalism and conservatism. Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought to create a more dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on the Western Front, the demoralised and {{depleted}} Indian Corps fought {{its final}} European battle at Loos. With {{the exception of}} two cavalry divisions, the Indian Corps in Europe redeployed to the Middle East theatre, sailing from Marseilles on 10 December 1915 and arriving in Basra on 8 January 1916 to <b>be</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force. Smith returned to active duty as a sergeant, serving in Mesopotamia and Palestine until the cessation of hostilities with the Ottoman Empire and Germany on 30 October and 11 November respectively. He had been wounded five times.|$|E

5|$|Summertime {{and holiday}} queues at the Ivanja Reka {{mainline}} toll plaza can be considerable, a problem exacerbated during the usual weekend-to-weekend tourist stays at Croatia's coastal resorts. In such conditions, motorway users {{are advised to}} use the Rugvica and Ivanić Grad exits ahead of the Ivanja Reka interchange to avoid the queues. As of October 2010, the westbound transit traffic approaching the Ivanja Reka interchange must exit the tolled motorway network, since the existing Zagreb bypass is not tolled, and then re-enter another tolled motorway. There are plans for the outer Zagreb bypass to <b>be</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tolled motorway network as the ultimate solution for congestion at the Ivanja Reka toll plaza. That will require reconstruction of the Ivanić Grad interchange east of the Ivanja Reka toll plaza.|$|E
5|$|Summertime {{and holiday}} queues at Lučko {{mainline}} toll plaza can be considerable, a problem exacerbated during the usual weekend-to-weekend tourist stays at Croatia's coastal resorts. In 2009, {{in an effort}} to address the problem, the Lučko mainline toll plaza was expanded to 15lanes, and a single additional 10-lane toll plaza was built for fast cashless toll collection in Demerje. The Demerje toll plaza is available via a motorway fork accessible to the A1 northbound traffic only. Vehicles using the Demerje toll plaza default to the original motorway route immediately past the Lučko mainline toll plaza, between the plaza and the Lučko interchange. The faster cashless system has raised the nominal capacity of the road from 2,325 to 11,150 vehicles per hour. As of September 2010 northbound traffic leaving the A1 must exit the tolled motorway network, since the existing Zagreb bypass is not tolled, and then re-enter another tolled motorway. There are plans for the outer Zagreb bypass to <b>be</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tolled motorway network, as the ultimate solution for congestion at the Lučko toll plaza. That will require construction of a Horvati interchange south of the Lučko toll plaza.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} the Bird-of-Prey on Vulcan were {{combinations}} of live-action footage—actors on a set in the Paramount parking lot that was covered with clay and used backdrops—and matte paintings for the ship itself and harsh background terrain. The scene of the ship's departure from Vulcan for Earth was more difficult to accomplish; the camera pans behind live-action characters to follow the ship as it leaves the atmosphere, and other items like flaming pillars and a flaring sun had to <b>be</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shot. Rather than try to match and combine camera pans of each element, each component was shot with a static camera and the pan {{was added to the}} resulting composite by a motion control camera. The sun (a light bulb focused by a convex lens) was shot in different passes to create realistic light effects on the Bird-of-Prey without having the light bleed around other elements in the shot.|$|E

5|$|Casimir III of Poland urged Louis to {{intervene}} in his war with the Lithuanians who had occupied Brest, Volodymyr-Volynskyi, and other important towns in Halych and Lodomeria in the previous years. The two monarchs agreed that Halych and Lodomeria would <b>be</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Hungary after Casimir's death. Casimir also authorized Louis to redeem the two realms for 100,000 florins if Casimir fathered a son. Louis led his army to Cracow in June 1351. Because Casimir fell ill, Louis became the sole commander of the united Polish and Hungarian army. He invaded the lands of the Lithuanian prince, Kęstutis, in July. Kęstutis seemingly accepted Louis's suzerainty on 15 August and agreed to be baptised, along with his brothers, in Buda. However, Kęstutis did nothing to fulfill his promises after Polish and Hungarian troops were withdrawn. In an attempt to capture Kęstutis, Louis returned, {{but he could not}} defeat the Lithuanians, who even killed one of his allies, Boleslaus III of Płock, in battle. Louis returned to Buda before 13 September. A papal legate visited Louis to persuade him to wage war against Stefan Dušan, Emperor of the Serbs, who had forced his Roman Catholic subjects to be re-baptised and join the Serbian Orthodox Church.|$|E

25|$|During summer 1972, Nixon {{nominated}} General Creighton Abrams for {{the post}} of Army Chief of Staff and upon assuming the post the general and others began to address the reformation of the Army {{in the wake of}} Vietnam. As soon as Abrams was sworn in he began to investigate the possibility of merging Chemical Corps into other Army branches. An ad hoc committee, designed to study possibilities, recommended that the Chemical Corps' smoke and flame mission <b>be</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Engineer Corps and the chemical operations <b>be</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Ordnance Corps. The groups recommendations were accepted in December 1972 and the United States Army Chemical Corps was officially disbanded, but not formally disestablished, by the Army on 11 January 1973.|$|E
