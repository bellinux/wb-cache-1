Although espousing Gladstonian Liberalism and opposing the affiliation of The Miners' Federation of Great Britain to the Labour Party, Watts Morgan joined the more radical and Marxist Plebs' League and sat on the board of governors for the Central Labour College.|$|E
5|$|According to Freitas, {{direct contact}} with civilizations {{significantly}} more advanced than humanity {{would have to take}} place within the Solar System, as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space. Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.|$|E
5|$|After {{serving as}} the most {{influential}} policymaking body of the dynasty {{for more than a}} century, the Deliberative Council was displaced and then made obsolete <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> ethnically mixed Grand Council, which the Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1722–1735) created in the late 1720s to circumvent the influence of the deliberative princes and ministers. The Deliberative Council was formally abolished in 1792.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Egyptian was a {{synthetic}} language, {{but it became}} more analytic later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles, which replaced the older inflectional suffixes. There was a change from the older verb–subject–object word order to subject–verb–object. The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> phonetic Coptic alphabet. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the Egyptian Orthodox Church, and traces of it are found in modern Egyptian Arabic.|$|E

John played badly while carrying a leg injury, and the very next match he was dropped, replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> experienced Watkins.|$|E
5|$|Hasdrubal led the Iberian and Gaulish cavalry on {{the left}} (south near the Aufidus River) of the Carthaginian army.

Hasdrubal was given about 6,500 cavalry, and Hanno had 3,500 Numidians on the right.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 an Austrian chemist Auer von Welsbach {{developed}} the Oslamp with a filament made of osmium, which he introduced commercially in 1902.

5|$|In {{other parts}} of Canterbury, the city walls became used for promenades <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> fashionable citizens. The Dane John Gardens were built between 1790 and 1803 by Simmons in the {{south-east}} corner of the walls, remodelling the old castle motte, and incorporating the Roman bank and the medieval wall-walk into the design. The ownership of the land was disputed, and the park was taken into {{the control of the}} city shortly after its construction.|$|E
5|$|John and {{the rebel}} barons {{did not trust}} each other, and neither side seriously {{attempted}} to implement the peace accord. The 25 barons selected for the new council were all rebels, chosen <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> extremist barons, and many among the rebels found excuses to keep their forces mobilised. Disputes began to emerge between those rebels who had expected the charter to return lands that had been confiscated and the royalist faction.|$|E

5|$|On December 9, 1943, {{the central}} {{committee}} of the separatist movement held a secret meeting in Palermo.

Vizzini shared common views with baron Lucio Tasca – one of the more important leaders of the movement – and despite protests <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> progressive wing, Vizzini remained at the meeting representing the province of Caltanissetta.|$|E

The Ghent Altarpiece, completed in 1432, had different configurations for weekdays, Sundays and church holidays.|$|E

A simple example {{is provided by}} the effect of replacing the hydrogen atoms in acetic acid <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> electronegative chlorine atom. The electron-withdrawing effect of the substituent makes ionisation easier, so successive pKa values decrease in the series 4.7, 2.8, 1.4, and 0.7 when 0, 1, 2, or 3 chlorine atoms are present. The Hammett equation, provides a general expression for the effect of substituents.|$|E
