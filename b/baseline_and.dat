25|$|The {{handwriting}} {{found in}} New Testament manuscripts varies. One way of classifying handwriting is by formality: book-hand vs. cursive. More formal, literary Greek works were often {{written in a}} distinctive style of even, capital letters called book-hand. Less formal writing consisted of cursive letters which could be written quickly. Another way of dividing handwriting is between uncial script (or majuscule) and minuscule. The uncial letters were a consistent height between the <b>baseline</b> <b>and</b> the cap height, while the minuscule letters had ascenders and descenders that moved past the <b>baseline</b> <b>and</b> cap height. Generally speaking, the majuscules are earlier than the minuscules, with a dividing line roughly in the 11th century.|$|E

Using a single-subject <b>baseline</b> <b>and</b> intervention design, Anderson, Nelson, Richardson, Webb, and Young explored the value of dialogue journals in developing a more supportive student-teacher relationship with emotionally and behaviorally challenged middle school students.|$|E

25|$|Myocarditis is a {{sometimes}} fatal {{side effect of}} clozapine, which usually develops within {{the first month of}} commencement. First manifestations of illness are fever which may be accompanied by symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection. Typically C-reactive protein (CRP) increases with the onset of fever and rises in the cardiac enzyme, troponin, occur up to 5 days later. Monitoring guidelines advise checking CRP and troponin at <b>baseline</b> <b>and</b> weekly for the first 4 weeks after clozapine initiation and observing the patient for signs and symptoms of illness. Signs of heart failure are less common and may develop with the rise in troponin. A recent case-control study found that the risk of clozapine-induced myocarditis is increased with increasing rate of clozapine dose titration, increasing age and concomitant sodium valproate.|$|E
25|$|The {{brain is}} never {{completely}} at rest. It never stops functioning and firing neuronal signals, {{as well as}} using oxygen {{as long as the}} person in question is alive. In fact, in Stark and Squire’s, 2001 study When zero is not zero: The problem of ambiguous baseline conditions in fMRI, activity in the medial temporal lobe (as well as in other brain regions) was substantially higher during rest than during several alternative baseline conditions. The effect of this elevated activity during rest was to reduce, eliminate, or even reverse the sign of the activity during task conditions relevant to memory functions. These results demonstrate that periods of rest are associated with significant cognitive activity and are therefore not an optimal baseline for cognition tasks. In order to discern <b>baseline</b> <b>and</b> activation conditions it is necessary to interpret a lot of information. This includes situations as simple as breathing. Periodic blocks may result in identical data of other variance in the data if the person breathes at a regular rate of 1 breath/5sec, and the blocks occur every 10s, thus impairing the data.|$|E

500|$|The game {{began with}} a tipoff between Kansas' seven foot tall Wilt Chamberlain and North Carolina's Tommy Kearns, who was not even six feet tall.

[...] The Jayhawks were unable to score on their opening {{possession}} and set up in their defense as the Tar Heels came down the court with the ball. Kansas' initial defense was a boxandone, which consisted of four players in a box around a basket while one player, Maurice King, played defense on North Carolina's Lennie Rosenbluth. Kearns received a pass along the <b>baseline</b> <b>and</b> was fouled in the act of shooting. Kearns missed the shot, but made both free throws to give Carolina the early 20 lead. Kansas missed a jump shot, and North Carolina's Joe Quigg converted a 12-foot baseline shot. Kansas scored their first points off of two free throws.|$|E
