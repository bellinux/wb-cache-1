In order to accommodate the intended uses of acetamiprid, Greece proposed to raise the existing MRLs of acetamiprid from 0. 01 * mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in purslane, from 0. 01 * mg/kg in peas (with pods) and 0. 06 mg/kg in beans (with pods) to 0. 5 mg/kg, from 0. 01 * mg/kg to 0. 05 mg/kg in <b>beans</b> (<b>without</b> <b>pods)</b> and from 0. 05 mg/kg to 0. 1 mg/kg in pulses (dry beans and peas). Greece drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 0. 15 mg/kg on beans (with pods), 0. 4 mg/kg on peas (with pods), 0. 07 mg/kg on <b>beans</b> (<b>without</b> <b>pods),</b> 0. 15 mg/kg on peas (without pods) and 0. 07 mg/kg on pulses (dry beans and peas); these MRL proposals reflect the intended uses in southern EU only. In addition, a MRL proposal for purslane (3 mg/kg) was derived by extrapolation from trials on lettuce. A deficiency was noted in some trials concerning the storage conditions of the samples prior analysis. Information needs to be provided to confirm that samples were effectively stored under conditions for which integrity of residues is demonstrated. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of acetamiprid in the commodities under consideration at the validated LOQ of 0. 01 mg/kg. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed uses will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values...|$|E
40|$|Cocoa plant {{generally}} {{is classified as}} cross pollinated plant and self-incompatible plant, then there is indication the presence of pollen influence on cocoa bean quality. This study was aimed {{to determine the effect}} of pollen sources (xenia) on the colour and size characters of fresh cocoa beans (Theobroma cacao L.). This study was done on two stages. The first stage, a treatment of hand pollination of cocoa clones of DR 1, DR 2, DRC 16, KW 264 and ICCRI 03 was applied in this study. There were five treatments of hand pollination: DR 2 x DR 1, DRC 16 x DR 1, DRC 16 X KW 264, DR 1 x DR 2 and ICCRI 03 x DRC 16. Each treatment was repeated four times. Colour parameters of fresh cocoa beans were observed. The second stage consisted of nine hand pollination combinations: TSH 858 x Sulawesi 1, TSH 858 x ICCRI 03, TSH 858 x KW 264, TSH 858 x KW 570, TSH 858 x Sca 6, Sulawesi 1 x TSH 858, Sulawesi 1 x Sca 6, Sulawesi 1 x KW 570 and KW 516 x Sca 6. Each treatment was repeated three times. Size parameters of fresh cocoa pod and beans were observed. The result showed that hybridization using pollen source from bulk cocoa and DR 1 contributed dark colour to fineflavored cocoa. This colour contribution was showed by the increase in the dark fresh percentage of cocoa beans. On the other hand, hybridization using pollen source from fine-flavored cocoa contributed white and pale colour to bulk cocoa. This light colour contribution was showed by the decrease in the percentage of the dark fresh beans. Xenia effect occured on pod weight, pod length, pod girth, bean weight with pulp per <b>pod</b> and <b>bean</b> weight <b>without</b> pulp per <b>pod</b> which was shown by the hybridization with TSH 858 as female parent and weight <b>bean</b> <b>without</b> pulp per <b>pod</b> shown by the hybridization with THS 858 and Sulawesi 1 as female parent...|$|R

Field experiments were conducted on an acidic sandy loam alfisol to investigate the effects of wood ash on the growth indices and chlorophyll content of maize and lima beans intercrop during the late and early seasons of 2014 and 2015 at Akure in the rainforest zone of southwestern Nigeria. The treatments were 100 % sole maize with ash, 100 % sole maize without ash, 75 % maize + 25 % lima beans with ash, 75 % + 25 % lima <b>beans</b> <b>without</b> ash, 50 % maize + 50 % lima beans with ash, 50 % maize + 50 % lima <b>beans</b> <b>without</b> ash, 25 % maize + 75 % lima beans with ash and 25 % maize + 75 % lima <b>beans</b> <b>without</b> ash. Wood ash was applied at 2. 4 kg/plot.

In addition to providing essential nutrients, it is used as an alternative to meat or other protein products for the population with a low-income. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of storage on the nutrient and antinutritional factors that the beans undergo during their process of cooking. Beans of the Carioca variety IAPAR 81 were assessed at 0, 45, 90, 135 and 180 days of storage and three processes of cooking: baked <b>beans</b> <b>without</b> soaking water (FCSAM), baked beans with soaking water (FCCAM) and baked <b>beans</b> <b>without</b> soaking (FCSM) and raw bean (control).

Dehulled mung beans {{can also be used}} in a similar fashion as whole beans for the purpose of making sweet soups. Mung beans in some regional cuisines of India are stripped of their outer coats to make mung dal. In Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, steamed whole beans are seasoned with spices and fresh grated coconut in a preparation called sundal சுண்டல். In south and north Indian states, mung beans are also eaten as pancakes. They are soaked in water for six to 12 hours (the higher the temperature, the lesser soaking time). Then they are ground into fine paste along with ginger and salt. Then pancakes are made on a very hot griddle. These are usually eaten for breakfast. This provides high quality protein that is rare in most Indian regional cuisines. Pongal or kichdi is another recipe that is made with rice and mung <b>beans</b> <b>without</b> skin. In Kerala, it is commonly used to make the parippu preparation in the Travancore region (unlike Cochin and Malabar, where toor dal, tuvara parippu,துவரப்பருப்பு is used).

The trial was conducted at Debre Zeit and Wondo Genet in 2006. Matured seeds of the species with protective seed coats were sown on standard soil mixture (SSM) that comprised 3 % top soil, 2 % cow dung and 1 % sand and their germination was compared with seeds with protective seed pods that were sown on composted farm yard manure (FYM). Two independent experiments were conducted in completely randomized design with four replications, each replication containing one hundred pure viable seeds. Mean comparisons of germination percentages revealed highly significant differences between the treatments (seeds with protective seed coats sown on farm yard manure) and control groups (seeds with protective seed coats sown on standard soil mixture) at P< 0. 05. Thus, the most viable means of propagating Pistacia chinensis under the nursery conditions of Debre Zeit was sowing seeds with pods on farm yard manure.
