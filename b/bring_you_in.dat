2500|$|A Baraita {{taught that}} Rabbi Simai deduced from the {{similarity}} of the phrases [...] "And I {{will take you to}} me for a people" [...] and [...] "And I will <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> to the land" [...] in [...] that the Israelites' Exodus from Egypt occurred under circumstances similar to their entry into the Land of Israel. Rabbi Simai thus deduced that just as only two out of 600,000 (Caleb and Joshua) entered the Promised Land, so only two out of every 600,000 Israelites in Egypt participated in the Exodus, and the rest died in Egypt. Rava taught that it will also be so when the Messiah comes that {{only a small portion of}} Jews will find redemption, for [...] says, [...] "And she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the days when she came up out of the land of Egypt," [...] implying that circumstances upon the coming of the Messiah will be similar to those upon the Israelites' entry into the Land of Israel.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ay, Mistress Dennet," [...] said Tibble, [...] "thou mayst trust him, {{spite of}} his garb, and 'tis the sole hope. He could only thus <b>bring</b> <b>thee</b> <b>in.</b> Go thou on, and the lad and I will fall to our prayers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I needn't <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>in,</b> because I have {{something}} to ask Hilda. No doubt, it's unnecessary, but you won't mind my warning you not {{to be influenced by}} anything that woman said." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> {{some wine}} and water now," [...] Diedrich said. [...] "They are getting supper, and I {{will send you}} a bowl of soup, {{as soon as it}} is ready." ...|$|E

And to myself I say, 'Holder of the Axe, content {{yourself with}} the axe and what it may <b>bring</b> to <b>you</b> <b>in</b> fair fight and glory'; and {{to both of us}} I say, 'Let the Dead sleep unawakened until we go to join them, which surely will be soon enough.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, Miss Kate," [...] said Uncle Braddock, as {{he started}} off on {{his way through the}} woods; [...] "that may be a werry pious way to go a-huntin' but it won't <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> much meat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Women have queer tastes, you know. We {{like all}} sorts of men. I think I must ask Mr. Wrayson to <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> to tea one afternoon. Would you like to come?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Hopkins always {{complained that}} Dane Cop {{was not worth}} the rent, but it will <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> a good revenue now,” said the girl. “Still, doesn’t that seem a little hard upon {{the man who has}} lost it?” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Hilary. [...] "But I think I might been {{a little}} civiller in saying what I did. The rumor's been a great {{annoyance}} to me; and I like to share my annoyances with other people. I suppose your business often <b>brings</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> contact with men of that friendly disposition? Heigh?" [...] Hilary rolled the cigar {{he was about to}} light between his lips.|$|R

6000|$|... "I hope," [...] he said, [...] "you don't {{mind the}} smell," [...] {{which was a}} mingled one of oil-colors and tobacco-smoke. [...] "The woman's putting my office to rights, and it's all {{in a cloud of}} dust. So I have to <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A capital little story, just {{young and}} sentimental {{enough to make}} it taking, and not overdone. Please let me have it, with a few verbal corrections, ready for the press when I come {{home at the end of}} September. It will <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> about £15." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{just about}} used up; and I'm {{going to give}} you a cup of hot coffee. That'll <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> round <b>in</b> a jiffy. It's time for supper. Hey, Sally?" ...|$|R
