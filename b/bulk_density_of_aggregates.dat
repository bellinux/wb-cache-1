40|$|WOS: 000358626000003 International audienceEffective density {{measurements}} are used extensively to convert submicron particle sizes {{based on a}} particle's mobility diameter into mass. Measurements <b>of</b> the effective <b>density</b> also provide information concerning the particle morphology. For example, the effective <b>density</b> curves <b>of</b> fractal <b>aggregates</b> reveal a scaling factor that seems to correlate with the fractal dimension of the particles. The present paper proposes a simple semi-empirical model that permits the quantitative interpretation of these measurements to determine parameters such as the fractal dimension, the primary particle size, and the <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> an <b>aggregate</b> particle. The proposed model {{is based on the}} assumption that the hydrodynamic drag force <b>of</b> an <b>aggregate</b> is proportional to the drag force applied to isolated primary spheres and to the number of primary spheres in the aggregate at power a. The model was applied to soot particles produced by either a spark discharge (PALAS GFG 1000) or by combustion (miniCAST 5206) -both mechanisms enable the generation <b>of</b> <b>aggregates</b> or agglomerates with very different primary sphere diameters. The proposed model showed a good fit for all <b>of</b> the effective <b>density</b> measurements obtained in this study; the a parameter was driven by the aggregate fractal dimension and by the Knudsen number that was determined based on the primary particle diameter. Finally, for a known primary particle diameter, the fractal dimension and the <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> were determined successfully with the proposed model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we discuss the origin and evolution of comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in relation to that of comets in general and in the framework of current solar system formation models. Methods. We use data from the OSIRIS scientific cameras as basic constraints. In particular, we discuss the overall bi-lobate shape and the presence of key geological features, such as layers and fractures. We also treat the problem of collisional evolution of comet nuclei by a particle-in-a-box calculation for an estimate of the probability of survival for 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during the early epochs of the solar system. Results. We argue that the two lobes of the 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko nucleus are derived from two distinct objects that have formed a contact binary via a gentle merger. The lobes are separate bodies, though sufficiently similar to have formed in the same environment. An estimate of the collisional rate in the primordial, trans-planetary disk shows that most comets of similar size to 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko are likely collisional fragments, although survival of primordial planetesimals cannot be excluded. Conclusions. A collisional origin of the contact binary is suggested, and the low <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the <b>aggregate</b> and abundance <b>of</b> volatile species show that a very gentle merger must have occurred. We thus consider two main scenarios: the primordial accretion of planetesimals, and the re-accretion of fragments after an energetic impact onto a larger parent body.

The impacts of intensively-managed short-rotation forestry on soil aggregate structure and Carbon (C) dynamics are largely undocumented in tropical ecosystems. Long-term sustainability {{of these systems}} is probably in part linked to maintenance of soil organic matter and good soil structure and aggregation, especially in areas with low-fertility soils. This study investigated soil aggregate dynamics on a clay soil and a sandy soil, each with a Eucalyptus plantation and an adjacent primary forest. Silvicultural management did not reduce total C stocks, and did not change soil <b>bulk</b> <b>density.</b> <b>Aggregates</b> <b>of</b> the managed soils did not decrease in mass as hypothesized, which indicates that soil cultivation in 6 year cycles did not cause large decreases in soil aggregation in either soil texture.

40|$|Soil {{aggregates}} are structural {{units of}} soil, which create complex pore systems controlling gas and water storage and fluxes in soil. Aggregates can be destroyed during swelling and shrinking or by external forces like mechanical compaction and yet, {{the knowledge of}} how physical impact alters aggregate structure remains limited. The aim {{of the study was}} to quantify the impact of compaction on macroaggregates, mainly on the pore size distribution and water flow. In this study, aggregates (2 - 5 mm) were collected by dry sieving in grassland of the Fuchsenbigl-Marchfeld Critical Zone Observatory (Austria). The structural alterations <b>of</b> these soil <b>aggregates</b> under controlled compaction were investigated with a non-invasive 3 D X-ray microtomography (XMT). The detailed changes in pore size distribution between aggregates (interpores, diameter > 90 μm) and within the aggregates (intrapores, diameter ≤ 90 μm) in pre- and post-compacted soils were revealed at two soil moisture (9. 3 % and 18. 3 % w/w) and two <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> increments (0. 28 and 0. 71 gcm- 3 from the initial values). The soil permeability was simulated using lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) based on 3 D images. Soil compaction significantly reduced total pores volume and the proportion of interpores volume and surface area, while total pore surface area and the proportion of intrapores volume and surface area increased. The increases in soil moisture tended to reduce the effects of compaction on interpores and intrapores, while the high compaction increment drastically changed the pore size distribution. The aggregate compaction decreased water penetration potential due to the increase of small intra-aggregate pores and cavities as demonstrated by LBM. Notably, the LBM results showed a significant linear correlation between the water flow rate and <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> soil <b>aggregates</b> and predicted that the water flow could be reduced by up to 97 - 99 % at <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> ≥ 1. 6 gcm- 3 with soil water content of 18. 3 % w/w. Thus, a combination of imaging and modelling provided new insights on the compaction effects on aggregates, underpinning the importance of protecting soil structure from mechanical compaction to minimise environmental impacts of soil compaction and maintain water infiltration and percolation in arable soils...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{removal of}} thick layers of soil under native {{scrubland}} (Cerrado) {{on the right}} bank of the Paraná River in Selvíria (State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil) for construction of the Ilha Solteira Hydroelectric Power Plant caused environmental damage, affecting the revegetation process of the stripped soil. Over the years, various kinds of land use and management systems have been tried, and {{the aim of this}} study was to assess the effects of these attempts to restore the structural quality of the soil. The experiment was conducted considering five treatments and thirty replications. The following treatments were applied: stripped soil without anthropic intervention and total absence of plant cover; stripped soil treated with sewage sludge and planted to eucalyptus and grass a year ago; stripped soil developing natural secondary vegetation (capoeira) since 1969; pastureland since 1978, replacing the native vegetation; and soil under native vegetation (Cerrado). In the 0. 00 - 0. 20 m layer, the soil was chemically characterized for each experimental treatment. A 30 -point sampling grid was used to assess soil porosity and <b>bulk</b> <b>density,</b> and to assess aggregate stability in terms of mean weight diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD). Aggregate stability was also determined using simulated rainfall. The results show that using sewage sludge incorporated with a rotary hoe improved the chemical fertility of the soil and produced more uniform soil pore size distribution. Leaving the land to develop secondary vegetation or turning it over to pastureland produced an intermediate level of structural soil quality, and these two treatments produced similar results. Stripped soil without anthropic intervention was of the lowest quality, with the lowest values for cation exchange capacity (CEC) and macroporosity, as well as the highest values <b>of</b> soil <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> and percentage <b>of</b> <b>aggregates</b> with diameter size < 0. 50 mm, corroborated by its lower organic matter content. However, the percentage <b>of</b> larger <b>aggregates</b> was higher in the native vegetation treatment, which boosted MWD and GMD values. Therefore, assessment of some land use and management systems show that even decades after their implementation to mitigate the degenerative effects resulting from the installation of the Hydroelectric Plant, more efficient approaches are still required to recover the structural quality of the soil...|$|R
