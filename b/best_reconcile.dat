6000|$|Few poems {{have been}} more {{variously}} designated than Comus. Milton himself describes it simply as [...] "A Mask"; by others it has been criticised and estimated as a lyrical drama, a drama in the epic style, a lyric poem {{in the form of}} a play, a phantasy, an allegory, a philosophical poem, a suite of speeches or majestic soliloquies, and even a didactic poem. Such variety in the description of the poem is explained partly by its complex charm and many-sided interest, and partly by the desire to describe it from that point of view which should <b>best</b> <b>reconcile</b> its literary form with what we know of the genius and powers of its author. Those who, like Dr. Johnson, have blamed it as a drama, have admired it [...] "as a series of lines," [...] or as a lyric; one writer, who has found that its characters are nothing, its sentiments tedious, its story uninteresting, has nevertheless [...] "doubted whether there will ever be any similar poem which gives so true a conception of the capacity and the dignity of the mind by which it was produced" [...] (Bagehot's Literary Studies). Some who have praised it as an allegory see in it a satire on the evils both of the Church and of the State, while others regard it as alluding to the vices of the Court alone. Some have found its lyrical parts the best, while others, charmed with its [...] "divine philosophy," [...] have commended those deep conceits which place it alongside of the Faerie Queen, as shadowing forth an episode in the education of a noble soul and as a poet's lesson against intemperance and impurity. But no one can refuse to admit that, more than any other of Milton's shorter poems, it gives us an insight into the peculiar genius and character of its author: it was, in the opinion of Hallam, [...] "sufficient to convince any one of taste and feeling that a great poet had arisen in England, and one partly formed in a different school from his contemporaries." [...] It is true that in the early poems we do not find the whole of Milton, for he had yet to pass through many years of trouble and controversy; but Comus, in a special degree, reveals or foreshadows much of the Milton of Paradise Lost. Whether we regard its place in Milton's life, in the series of his works, or in English literature as a whole, the poem is full of significance: it is worth while, therefore, to consider how its form was determined by the external circumstances and previous training of the poet; by his favourite studies in poetry, philosophy, history, and music; and by his noble theory of life in general, and of a poet's life in particular.|$|E

40|$|The {{enactment}} of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) was well-received by all as it repealed Medicare’s Sustainable Growth Rate and, in its place, mandates {{the implementation of a}} new system for health care delivery and payment. Under MACRA, health care providers are expected to work together and coordinate their efforts with the goal of improving patient outcomes and controlling costs. For the first time ever, federal reimbursements will be tied to quality of care and improved cost efficiencies. However, as a new law, MACRA’s potential for success needs to be measured in terms of its “fit” within the existing legal framework. Specifically, MACRA’s fee-for-value approach needs to be assessed against the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act (Stark). As a strict liability law that encourages health care providers to continue working in silos, Stark has had a chilling effect on the health care industry as multi-million dollar penalties have been assessed for a single prohibited referral made by a physician for certain federally reimbursable health care services. Ironically, the type of conduct Stark prohibits is the very conduct that MACRA needs health care providers to engage in to achieve its goals. This misalignment between the two laws poses a significant impediment to MACRA’s successful implementation. This Article discusses the inherent misalignment between MACRA and Stark, provides an overview of the original intent behind both laws, and shows which provision of Stark is in direct contravention of MACRA. Specifically, it advocates that the provision of Stark that regulates physician compensation is an impediment to health care reform and unnecessary in light of the modern-day, more robust Anti-Kickback Statute.

40|$|The {{research}} {{attempts to}} explain the character of Malaysia’s political economy. By adopting a historical institutional analysis it explains that British colonial administration persistently made rational choices within a short-term horizon that encouraged the growth of two autonomous groups – Malays and Chinese - whose political, economic and social organisation, {{at the point of}} Malaya’s independence in 1957, had made it inevitable for them to embark on some form of consociational arrangement. British policies engendered two processes; first, a less-than-full incorporation of Chinese as new actors in Malaya’s political economy and second, a less-than-full retrenchment of Malay political dominance by preserving Malay de jure power. In sum, British decision to preserve Malay de jure power {{while at the same time}} incorporate Chinese economic and political presence created two communities with mutually exclusive institutions that increasingly competed for access to political and economic resources. The self-reinforcing nature of these exclusive institutions and the flux that came with the demands for Malaya’s independence made it necessary for these two communities to attempt various institutional options that could <b>best</b> <b>reconcile</b> exclusive institutions and negotiate competing political and economic demands. Three institutional options were tried: consociationalism, integration and partition. The research will explain that among the three, the path-dependent nature of Malaya’s political economy had necessitated a particular institutional logic, the consociational logic. Integration failed because attempts to establish common institutions and do away completely with longstanding mutually exclusive ones proved over-ambitious. Partition also did not materialise as it proved politically and financially costly. In sum, the research highlights Malaysia’s consociationalism as a product of small incremental policy steps which proved to be no less transformational in the long run that gives Malaysia’s political economy a quite different character than it had had at the start of British official rule in 1874.

40|$|The {{number of}} multiracial {{individuals}} in America, {{many of whom}} define their racial identity in different ways, has grown dramatically {{in recent years and}} continues to increase. From this demographic shift a movement seeking unique racial status for multiracial individuals has emerged. The multiracial movement is distinguishable from other race-based movements in that it is primarily driven by identity rather than the quest for political, social, or economic equality. It is not clear how equal protection doctrine, which is concerned primarily with state-created racial classifications, will or should accommodate multiracialism. Nor is it clear how to <b>best</b> <b>reconcile</b> the recognition of individual identity with the continuing need to address group-based racial discrimination and subordination. In this Essay, I explore the potential impact of multiracialism — and multiracial identity in particular — on the future of racial classifications under equal protection doctrine. As a framework for its analysis, the Essay invokes two theories used to interpret the meaning of equal protection: antisubordination and anticlassification. Viewed solely through the lens of multiracial identity, the common normative understanding of these two approaches contorts. While antisubordination is often perceived as more beneficial for groups battling entrenched racial hierarchy, it may facilitate unique harms for multiracial individuals seeking to carve out a racial identity distinct from traditionally defined racial categories. And although anticlassification is often viewed by progressives as detrimental to the pursuit of true racial equality, it may lend more support to policies of racial self-identification and the recognition of a unique multiracial identity. A looming danger, therefore, is that anticlassification advocates wishing to dismantle frameworks rooted in traditional notions of race may exploit multiracialism to “undo” race and to undermine the use of racial classifications altogether. In response to that possibility, this Essay argues that although law and identity inevitably inform and impact one another, they also serve distinct purposes that should not be improperly conflated in the context of multiracialism. The construction of identity is ultimately a very personal endeavor, and although legal recognition may be one aspect of identity, in the area of race, the law has a more powerful function to play in preventing racial subordination. Where possible, the law should accommodate multiracial individuals who wish to define their own racial identity, but as long as it remains more aspirational than realistic, the individual’s perception of race should not be used or manipulated to undermine the use of racial classifications to counter societal race discrimination...|$|E
40|$|The {{total area}} and {{annual rate of}} native {{vegetation}} clearing is greatest in the Cerrado region followed by the Brazilian states of Para, Mato Grosso, Maranhao and Rondonia. Amazonian forest clearing proceeds most quickly where abundant natural resources (wood or land) are accessible by roads and close to markets. These regions are concentrated along the eastern and southern flanks of Amazonia, particularly in eastern Para, Cuiaba and Rondonia. There are still large discrepancies in estimates of annual deforestation; Landsat (Thematic Mapper-based) mapping of deforestation in the closed-canopy forests of Amazonia has not include non-Brazilian countries and is incomplete for the cerrado biome. Amazonian deforestation was last mapped 1994. Current estimates of Amazonian forest clearing do not include most of the forests that are affected by logging each year, which is an area (about 7, 000 km 2 yr- 1) {{more than half the}} size of the area of annual deforestation. Logging changes forest structure and increases forest flammability. The intensity of logging ranges from 1 -to 100 -species harvest, and averages 20 m 3 of wood harvested per hectare. Logging may increase dramatically in the coming years. Fire affects large, but difficult to measure, areas of pastureland, logged forests, secondary forests and primary forests. Forest ground fires are particularly difficult to map fom satellite data. Fire is more frequent where forest clearing is taking place, and where seasonal drought is most severe. The destiny of Amazonian forest land cleared for crops and cattle pasture is complex, and highly variables regionally. Areal estimates are needed for managed pasture, degraded pasture, cropland and secondadry forests, for these ecosystems are functionally distinct. Most forest clearing is for pasture establishment, followed by shifting cultivation. Cattle pasture is the logical land-use for both small-scale and large-scale rural Amazonians because cattle are easily sold or traded, and they maintain their value during inflation. Cattle patures help secure land claims and increase land value. In the Cerrado, there has been a shift from extensive cattle grazing of natural savannas to pasture planted with African forage grasses; mechanized soy bean production is the second most extensive land-use. Pastures are the most important land-cover for the LBA (Large-Scale Biosphere - Atmosphere experiment in Amazonia) science campaign. Brazilian Amazonia experiences reduced rainfall during ENSO events. ENSO-related drought is most severe in eastern Amazonia. A basin-wide reduction in rainfall would have its greatest affect on vegetation near the border between savanna and closed-canopy forest in Rondonia, Mato Grosso, Para and Tocantins. The LBA campaign should be conducted in variety of rural landscapes to capture the multiplicity of human effects on native ecosystems, as well as the range of cliamatic and edaphic conditions under which these ecosystems have evolved. It should address the current (ENSO) and predicted variations in climate, and should be designed to recommend those land-uses that <b>best</b> <b>reconcile</b> the maintenance of ecosystem processes with socially equitable economic growth. 199...|$|E

40|$|Psychotherapy, {{said one}} of its {{earliest}} clients, Anna O, is a “talking cure. ” It banishes or lessens mental illness and suffering not with medicine or surgery, but with words. This aspect of psychotherapy raises an interesting set of First Amendment questions. Is verbal communication between a therapist and her client protected by the First Amendment {{even though it is}} part of a healing process, or does government have the same authority to restrict this speech-based healing method as it does to restrict the use of pharmaceuticals or medical equipment? Must it show that therapists’ statements about human psychology are false or harmful to the client? Or may it constitutionally bar even truthful therapist-client communications that raise little risk of harm to the client’s physical or mental health, on the grounds that such verbal treatments promote values or behaviors at odds with those of the profession or of the larger society? These questions are challenging for First Amendment law largely because talk therapy is the kind of activity that straddles an important boundary line in First Amendment law and theory. As the Supreme Court noted in Lawrence v. Texas, the Constitution assumes that there will be certain “spaces” where “the State” is not a “dominant presence” and where sovereignty belongs to each individual, not those who exercise collective political power. Among such spaces is the First Amendment-secured realm of “thought, belief, [and] expression. ” 539 U. S. 558, 562 (2003). This constitutional line drawn by the Court in Lawrence mirrors that described by John Locke in A Letter Concerning Toleration: Locke argued that while state power extends to “civil interests” such as protection of “life, liberty, health” and other “outward” concerns, it does not extend to the “care of the soul,” which remains under the control of the individual himself. The challenge presented by psychotherapy, I argue in this article, is that it falls partly within and partly outside this constitutional shielded sphere of mental and expressive autonomy. On the one hand, if there is any activity that belongs in the realm of constitutionally protected “thought, belief, [and] expression” it the self-exploration that individuals engage in as they try to understand their inner lives – whether it occurs in a private meditation or diary entry, or in a psychotherapist’s office. When we use talk therapy, in part, to shape (or reshape) our conception of the good, or the perspective we should take on particular life events, the state should not be permitted to forcibly substitute its values for ours. On the other hand, while government is not supposed to interfere with our choices about what to say or think, or about what values to hold, it is charged with protecting our health and safety, and, in psychotherapy, such health and safety interests are very often at stake – for example, when individuals rely on therapists to make accurate diagnoses of possible mental illnesses (or rule them out), and suggest the proper treatment such conditions. The central question about talk therapy’s First Amendment status then is what kind of First Amendment regime can <b>best</b> <b>reconcile</b> these two conflicting demands – to keep government interference out of the way we understand and shape our mental life through conversation, while letting it into medical practices with significant stakes for our mental health. How, in other words, can First Amendment law simultaneously allow the state to regulate the aspects of psychotherapy that are its business, while keeping it out of those aspects that are in the sphere of individual autonomy? This is also a question that is key to the debate about the First Amendment status of other “occupational speech” that occurs when we seek verbal guidance from other experts...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{problem of}} {{estimating}} {{the parameters of}} dynamic models of complex biological systems from time series data is becoming increasingly important. Methods and results Particular consideration is given to metabolic systems that are formulated as Generalized Mass Action (GMA) models. The estimation problem is posed as a global optimization task, for which novel techniques {{can be applied to}} determine the best set of parameter values given the measured responses of the biological system. The challenge is that this task is nonconvex. Nonetheless, deterministic optimization techniques can be used to find a global solution that <b>best</b> <b>reconciles</b> the model parameters and measurements. Specifically, the paper employs branch-and-bound principles to identify the best set of model parameters from observed time course data and illustrates this method with an existing model of the fermentation pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This is a relatively simple yet representative system with five dependent states and a total of 19 unknown parameters of which the values are to be determined. Conclusion The efficacy of the branch-and-reduce algorithm is illustrated by the S. cerevisiae example. The method described in this paper is likely to be widely applicable in the dynamic modeling of metabolic networks. </p...|$|R
