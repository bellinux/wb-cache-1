5|$|Adi Da wrote {{many books}} about his spiritual {{philosophy}} and related matters, founding a publishing house to print them.

5|$|At this time, the {{dreadnought}} design had {{not been}} fully validated, despite {{the success of the}} British namesake; for example, there were still concerns that the Minas Geraes class' superfiring turret arrangement—which {{had not been}} utilized on the original Dreadnought, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> being installed on the American —would cause blast to hurt the crew in the lower turret. Any immediate concerns, however, were mitigated during the firing tests when no ill effects were observed, though the Times (London) reported that there were still concerns registered during São Paulos gun trials in June 1910.|$|E

5|$|During the Middle Ages {{the town}} largely {{depended}} on the abbey <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> a centre for the wool trade until the 18th century.

5|$|Heresy {{trials of}} {{prominent}} New School leaders further deepened the division within the denomination. Both the Presbytery and Synod of Philadelphia found Albert Barnes, pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, guilty of heresy. Old School Presbyterians, however, were outraged when the New School dominated General Assembly of 1831 dismissed the charges. Lyman Beecher, famous revivalist, moral reformer {{and president of}} the newly established Lane Theological Seminary, was charged with heresy in 1835 <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> acquitted.|$|E

England played poorly against Sri Lanka, with Trescothick finding it hard to build a large innings. He attempted {{to take control of}} the match with 70 at Colombo, as England tried to get something from the series, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> criticised for his poor catching.|$|E

5|$|Toads {{have a more}} {{sinister}} reputation. It was believed in European folklore that they were associated with witches as their familiar spirits and had magical powers.

5|$|After a rough {{position}} of the burst had been determined, Enrico Costa of the BeppoSAX team contacted astronomer Dale Frail at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array. Frail began making observations at a wavelength of 20centimeters at 01:30UTC, less than four hours after the discovery. While preparing for his observations Frail contacted astronomer Stanislav Djorgovski, who was working with the Hale telescope. Djorgovski immediately compared his images of the region with older images from the Digitized Sky Survey, but he found no new sources of light within the error box. Mark Metzger, a colleague of Djorgovski at the Caltech observatory, conducted a more extensive analysis of the data, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> unable to identify any new light sources.|$|E
5|$|British {{knowledge}} of thermonuclear weapons {{was based on}} work done at the Los Alamos Laboratory during the war. Two British scientists, Bretscher and Fuchs, had attended the conference on the Super (as it was then called) there in April 1946, and Chadwick had written a secret report on it in May 1946. The Classic Super design was unsuccessful. Fuchs and John von Neumann had produced an ingenious alternative design, for which they filed a patent in May 1946. This was tested in the American Operation Greenhouse George test in May 1951, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> found to be unworkable. There was also some intelligence about Joe 4 derived from its debris, which was provided to Britain under the 1948 Modus Vivendi. Penney established three megaton bomb projects at Aldermaston. Orange Herald, under Bryan Taylor, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo an interim thermonuclear design similar to Soviet Layer Cake used in Joe 4 and the American Alarm Clock; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design. Orange Herald {{would be the first}} British weapon to incorporate an external neutron initiator.|$|E
5|$|De Montfort's {{coalition}} {{began to}} quickly fragment, Henry regained his {{freedom of movement}} and renewed chaos spread across England. Henry appealed to Louis of France for arbitration in the dispute, as had been {{laid out in the}} Treaty of Kingston; de Montfort was initially hostile to this idea, but, as war became more likely again, he decided to agree to French arbitration as well. Henry went to Paris in person, accompanied by de Montfort's representatives. Initially de Montfort's legal arguments held sway, but in January 1264, Louis announced the Mise of Amiens, condemning the rebels, upholding the King's rights and annulling the Provisions of Oxford. Louis had strong views of his own on the rights of kings over those of barons, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> influenced by his wife, Margaret, who was Eleanor's sister, and by the Pope. Leaving Eleanor in Paris to assemble mercenary reinforcements, Henry returned to England in February 1264, where violence was brewing in response to the unpopular French decision.|$|E
