40|$|The <b>Barbatimão</b> is a tree which bark {{is rich in}} tannin. It is used {{on popular}} {{medicine}} as a wound healing agent, {{in the treatment of}} gastric lesions, as anti-leishmanial agent and as anti-inflammatory. Red blood cells (RBC) are labeled with technetium- 99 m (Tc- 99 m) and are utilized in many procedures in nuclear medicine. Some authors have reported that drugs (natural and synthetic) can alter the labeling of RBC with Tc- 99 m. This study evaluates the effect of <b>barbatimão</b> infusion on the labeling of red blood cells (RBC) and plasma (P) proteins with Tc- 99 m. Heparinized blood from Wistar rats was incubated with NaCl 0. 9 % as control and different concentrations of <b>barbatimão</b> infusion.

Coville, Leguminosae, {{also known}} in Brazil as <b>barbatimão,</b> {{is rich in}} tannins and many flavan- 3 -ols and proanthocyanidins such as prodelphinidins and prorobinetinidins. Previous studies have {{demonstrated}} several pharmacological properties of tannins from <b>barbatimão,</b> including anti-candidal activity. Methods The antifungal activity of proanthocyanidin polymeric tannins from Stryphnodendron adstringens (subfraction F 2. 4) was evaluated against three strains of Cryptococcus neoformans with different capsule expressions, using the broth microdilution technique, light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The effect of subfraction F 2. 4 on C. neoformans and melanoma mammalian cells pigmentation was also evaluated. Results Although susceptibility assays revealed MIC values quite similar (between 2. 5 and 5. 0 μg/ml), analyses of MFC values revealing that the acapsular mutant Cap 67 was more susceptible to be killed by the subfraction F 2. 4 (MFC = 20 μg/ml) than the two tested capsular strains (T 1 - 444 and ATCC 28957) (MFC > 160 μg/ml). Optical and electron microscopy experiments revealed relevant alterations in cell shape and size in all strains treated with 1 and 2. 5 μg/ml of subfraction F 2. 4. Capsule size of the capsular strains decreased drastically after subfraction F 2. 4 treatment. In addition, ultrastructural alterations such as cell wall disruption, cytoplasm extraction, mitochondria swelling, {{increase in the number}} of cytoplasmic vacuoles and formation of membranous structures in the cytoplasm were also observed in treated yeasts. Incubation with subfraction F 2. 4 also decreased C. neoformans pigmentation, however, did not interfere in melanization of B 16 F 10 mammalian cells. Conclusion Our data indicate that tannins extracted from S. adstringens interfered with growth, capsule size and pigmentation, all important virulence factors of C. neoformans, and may be considered as a putative candidate for the development of new antifungal agents. </p...|$|E

Active extracts from plants have emerged as natural potential candidates for its treatment. Abarema cochliacarpos (Gomes) Barneby & Grimes, Fabaceae (<b>Barbatimão),</b> is a native medicinal plant in to Brazil. Previously we have demonstrated in an acute colitis model a marked protective effect of a butanolic extract, {{so we decided to}} assess its anti-inflammatory effect in a chronic ulcerative colitis model induced by trinitrobenzensulfonic acid (TNBS). Abarema cochliacarpos (150 mg/day, v. o.) was administered for fourteen consecutive days. This treatment decreased significantly macroscopic damage as compared with TNBS. Histological analysis showed that the extract improved the microscopic structure. Myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) was significantly decreased. Study of cytokines showed that TNF-&# 945; was diminished and IL- 10 level was increased after Abarema cochliacarpos treatment. In order to elucidate inflammatory mechanisms, expression of cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were studied showing a significant downregulation. In addition, there was reduction in the JNK and p- 38 activation. Finally, I&# 954;B degradation was blocked by Abarema cochliacarpos treatment being consistent with an up-regulation of the NF-kappaB-binding activity. These results reinforce the anti-inflammatory effects described previously suggesting that Abarema cochliacarpos could provide a source for the search for new anti-inflammatory compounds useful in ulcerative colitis treatment...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the antioxidant effects of <b>barbatimão</b> (BAR) or pacari (PAC) on chicken meat oxidative stability and quality, seven dietary treatments containing in three different BAR and PAC concentrations (200, 400 and 600 ppm) plus a negative control (CONT) were fed to 350 broilers from 1 to 41 days of age. Ten birds per treatment were slaughtered to collect breast and thigh meat to evaluate pH, color (L*, a*, b*), cooking weight loss (CWL), and shear force (SF) 24 hours postmortem, and TBARS levels in precooked meatballs stored chilled for 8 days. The dietary supplementation with BAR and PAC extracts did not affect pH and color, but reduced (p< 0. 05) SF in breast meat compared with CONT suggesting improved tenderness. PAC 200 increased (p< 0. 05) L* and protected (p< 0. 05) yellow pigments (b* values) of thigh meat from degradation compared with the CONT diet. At {{the end of the}} chilled storage period, BAR 600 and PAC 600 significantly reduced (p< 0. 06) MDA concentrations in breast meatballs compared to the CONT. The dietary supplementation of BAR and PAC improved (p< 0. 03) oxidative stability of thigh meatballs, except for BAR 200. In conclusion, the dietary addition of BAR and PAC extracts may improve meat quality and prevent lipid oxidation in white and dark precooked and chilled chicken meatballs...|$|E
40|$|Stryphnodendron species, popularly named “barbatimão,” are {{traditionally}} used in Brazil as anti-inflammatory agents. This study aimed {{to investigate the}} effect of <b>barbatimão</b> and 11 other species on the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated THP- 1 cells, {{as well as their}} anti-arthritis activity. The extracts of Stryphnodendron adstringens, Stryphnodendron obovatum, Campomanesia lineatifolia, and Terminalia glabrescens promoted a concentration-dependent inhibition of TNF-α. Mice injected with LPS in the knee joint were treated per os with fractions from the selected extracts. Both the organic (SAO) and the aqueous (SAA) fractions of S. adstringens promoted a dose-dependent reduction of leukocyte migration and neutrophil accumulation into the joint, but none of them reduced CXCL 1 concentration in the periarticular tissue. In contrast, treatment with C. lineatifolia and T. glabrescens fractions did not ameliorate the inflammatory parameters. Analyses of SAO by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) led to the identification of gallic acid along with 11 prodelphinidins, characterized as monomers and dimers of the B-type. Our findings contribute to some extent to corroborating the traditional use of S. adstringens as an anti-inflammatory agent. This activity is probably related to a decrease of leukocyte migration into the inflammatory site. Polyphenols like gallic acid and prodelphinidins, identified in the active fraction, may contribute to the observed activity...|$|E

40|$|Natural {{rubber latex}} from Hevea brasiliensis has {{interesting}} characteristics {{related to this}} work such as: {{it is easy to}} manipulate, low cost, can stimulate the natural angiogenesis, is a biocompatible material and presents high mechanical resistance. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a novel sustained delivery system for Stryphnodendron sp. based on Natural Rubber Latex (NRL) membranes and to study the Stryphnodendron sp. delivery system behavior. Stryphnodendron sp., commonly known as <b>barbatimao</b> is extensively used in folk medicine for the treatment of diarrhoea, gynaecological problems and for healing wounds. The stem bark of this species is mentioned in the Brazilian Pharmacopeia with a content of at least 20 % of tannins. Previous studies showed significant cicatrizant properties, anti-inflammatory activity and gastric anti-ulcerogenic effects for the stem bark crude extract. One possible way to accelerate the tissue repair process, it was incorporated the Stryphnodendron sp. extract in NRL membranes. Stryphnodendron sp extract was incorporated into the NRL, by mixing it in solution for in vitro protein delivery experiments. Results show that the NRL membrane can release Stryphnodendron sp. for up to 49. 89 % of its Stryphnodendron sp. content for up 400 h. The kinetics of the extract release could be fitted with double exponential function, with two characteristic times of 0. 78 and 133. 22 h. In this study, we demonstrated that the induced angiogenesis provided by NRL membranes combined with a controlled release of extract is relevant for biomedical applications...|$|E
40|$|Bark {{extracts}} of Stryphnodendron adstringens (Mart) Coville a Leguminosae species, {{well known}} in Brazil as <b>barbatimao,</b> are popularly used as healing agent. The objective of this work {{was to determine the}} genetic diversity of S. adstringens populations and to correlate genetic distances to the production of tannins. S. adstringens accessions from populations found in Cerrado regions in the states of Goias, Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo were analyzed using the AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) technique. A total of 236 polymorphic bands were scored and higher proportion of genetic diversity was found inter populations (70. 9 %), rather than intra populations (29. 1 %). F-ST value was found to be significantly greater than zero (0. 2906), demonstrating the complex genetic structure of S. adstringens populations. Accessions collected in Cristalina, GO, showed higher percentage of polymorphic loci (87. 3 %) and the highest genetic diversity. The lowest genetic variability was detected among accessions from the population growing in Caldas Novas, GO. The genetic distance among populations was estimated using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA), which grouped populations into 3 clusters. Moreover, chemotypes with tannin concentration above 40 % showed higher genetic similarity. AFLP analysis proved to be an efficient gene mapping technique to determine the genetic diversity among remaining populations of S. adstringens. Obtained results may be employed to implement further strategies for the conservation of this medicinal plant. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Stryphnodendron adstringens (Mart.) Coville (<b>barbatimão)</b> is a tree {{belonging}} to the Fabaceae family, and it is commonly found in the southeastern Brazilian cerrado. The stem bark of this tree is traditionally used as an anti-inflammatory and antiseptic agent to treat leucorrhea and diarrhea, {{as well as to}} promote wound healing (owing to the presence of proanthocyanidins). Proanthocyanidins were obtained from the ethanolic extract of S. adstringens stem bark and assessed by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography with an ultraviolet/diode array detector. The identified compounds included gallic acid, catechin, gallocatechin (GC), epigallocatechin, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). The selected markers, GC and EGCG, were simultaneously used for chromatographic validation (linearity range: 30 - 330 ng, equivalent to 3 - 33 µg/mL; r> 0. 998). The method showed precision (intra-day relative standard deviation [RSD]: 1. 72 % for GC; 1. 16 % for EGCG; inter-day RSD: 1. 74 %- 2. 60 % for both markers), accuracy, robustness, and selectivity. The limits of detection and quantitation were 0. 29 µg/ml and 0. 89 µg/ml for GC, and 0. 88 µg/mL and 2. 67 µg/mL for EGCG, respectively.

O objetivo deste trabalho foi verificar o efeito do substituto de pólen na redução da mortalidade da cria ensacada brasileira durante o florescimento do Stryphnodendron adstringens. Foram utilizados dois tratamentos: as colmeias do tratamento 1 receberam semanalmente substituto de pólen (mistura de farinha de soja, fubá e farinha de trigo em proporções iguais). As colmeias do tratamento 2 não receberam o substituto de pólen, tendo como único alimento o pólen que encontravam na natureza. As colmeias alimentadas apresentaram diferença significativa de 93, 5 % de viabilidade de sobrevivência de cria em relação às não alimentadas, que apresentaram 80, 4 % de sobrevivência.

This study verified the effect of pollen substitute on the reduction of Apis mellifera L. mortality, caused by Brazilian sac brood during Stryphnodendron adstringens flowering. Two treatments were used: in treatment one, colonies received pollen substitute weekly (a blend of a soy flour, maize flour and wheat flour of equal proportions). The hives of treatment 2 didn´t receive the replacement of pollen substitute, receiving only the pollen found in nature. The hives which were fed with the pollen substitute had significant difference of 93. 5 % of brood survival viability when compared to non-fed which had 80. 4 % of survival.
