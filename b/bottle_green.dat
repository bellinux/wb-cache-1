5|$|Cumberland's {{neighbour}} club Western Suburbs {{had used}} {{black and white}} as their colours, which {{had been taken from}} Ashfield rugby club, a second grade rugby union team which supplied many of Western Suburbs players. Unlike other clubs, Western Suburbs did not take their colours from their district rugby union team, due to Ashfield's influence at the club. Cumberland thought of using the <b>bottle</b> <b>green</b> of the Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club, as many of their team members were from there. However, the club believed that some would be unable to distinguish Western Suburbs and Cumberland if this approach was taken.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of a <b>bottled</b> <b>green</b> tea beverage on dentin demineralization with a demineralization gel system in vitro. Samples were cut from bovine root dentin. Each sample was immersed in 8 % methylcellulose gel onto which a layer of green tea beverage was placed. For comparison, sugar-free coffee beverage, deionized water, and 0. 8 -ppm F solutions were used. After two weeks, the treatment solutions were replaced with demineralization solution. The mineral profiles and mineral loss values of the lesions were obtained by transversal microradiography (TMR) after one-week demineralization. The green tea, coffee, and fluoride solution treatments induced a significantly thicker surface layer when compared with the deionized water treatment. In particular, the mineral volume % of the demineralized dentin specimens treated with green tea was approximately seven times higher than that of the de-ionized water treatment. The green tea treatment showed significantly lower mineral loss than the other three treatments. TMR measurements clearly showed that the sugar-free <b>bottled</b> <b>green</b> tea beverage inhibited dentin lesion progression, presumably due to the effect of sub-ppm fluoride levels...|$|R

2500|$|Portrait of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge is {{the first}} {{official}} portrait of the Duchess. Emsley, originally of South Africa and a 2007 recipient of the BP Portrait Award, had previously painted portraits of Nelson Mandela and Naipaul. In a video interview for The Daily Telegraph, Emsley suggested that beginning he was thrilled to receive the commission. [...] "Slowly" [...] he says he realized {{the importance of the}} project was, not just for himself, but for many others, making him slightly nervous. He was keen to capture Catherine's [...] "charm, serenity and intelligence" [...] and [...] "sparkling green eyes". The Duchess sat for him twice—for a day's session in May at the artist's studio in Bradford-upon-Avon, and a brief session in June at Kensington Palace, where he did quick drawings and took more photographs—and he used photographs to assist him. He describes her during the process as [...] "quite amenable". According to Emsley, Catherine had asked for herself to be painted naturally, as opposed to her official self." [...] It shows Catherine wearing a <b>bottle</b> <b>green</b> pussy bow blouse, looking straight out from the picture, smirking, rather than grinning. The artist noted that, if too defined, smiling portraiture occasionally may [...] "look like caricatures". Emsley darkened the eyes slightly to match her tunic; the background is also shaded in a similar hue of dark green. Emsley was also keen {{to draw attention to the}} rich texture of her hair. Talking to the BBC after criticism of his work, he noted that he didn't want to overwhelm her face. Emsley said, [...] "I don't have lots of things in the background. I do like large faces, I find them strong and contemporary. I'm interested in the landscape of the face, the way in which light and shadow fall across the forms. That's really my subject matter. To have anything else in there is really just an interference." [...] As Catherine's image [...] "is so pervasive", he told the media he needed to go past the image on his mind.|$|E

6000|$|Kipps endured splendour at the Royal Grand Hotel {{for three}} nights and days, {{and then he}} retreated in disorder. The Royal Grand {{defeated}} and overcame and routed Kipps, not of intention, but by sheer royal grandeur, grandeur combined with an organisation for his comfort carried to excess. On his return he came upon a difficulty; {{he had lost his}} circular piece of cardboard with the number of his room, and he drifted about the hall and passages in a state of perplexity for some time, until he thought all the porters and officials in gold lace caps must be watching him and jesting to one another about him. Finally, in a quiet corner, down below the hairdresser's shop, he found a kindly looking personage in <b>bottle</b> <b>green,</b> to whom he broached his difficulty. [...] "I say," [...] he said, with a pleasant smile, [...] "I can't find my room nohow." [...] The personage in <b>bottle</b> <b>green,</b> instead of laughing in a nasty way, as he might well have done, became extremely helpful, showed Kipps what to do, got his key, and conducted him by lift and passage to his chamber. Kipps tipped him half a crown.|$|E

60|$|M. Binet reared {{his great}} head and turned upon her {{eyes that were}} blood-injected. He scowled, blew out his thick lips and made harsh noises in his throat. Yet he took stock of her, so graceful and comely and looking so {{completely}} the lady of fashion in her long fur-trimmed travelling coat of <b>bottle</b> <b>green,</b> her muff and her broad hat adorned by a sparkling Rhinestone buckle above her adorably coiffed brown hair.

60|$|So at {{the next}} {{opportunity}} he gave the man an unexpected shilling, and having once put his hand in his pocket, {{there was no reason}} why he should not go on. He bought a newspaper at the book-stall and tipped the boy the rest of the shilling, and then went up by the lift and tipped the man a sixpence, leaving his newspaper inadvertently in the lift. He met his chambermaid in the passage and gave her half a crown. He resolved to demonstrate his position to the entire establishment in this way. He didn't like the place; he disapproved of it politically, socially, morally, but he resolved no taint of meanness should disfigure his sojourn in its luxurious halls. He went down by the lift (tipping again), and, being accosted by a waiter with his gibus, tipped the finder half a crown. He had a vague sense that he was making a flank movement upon the hotel and buying over its staff. They would regard him as a character. They would get to like him. He found his stock of small silver diminishing, and replenished it at a desk in the hall. He tipped a man in <b>bottle</b> <b>green</b> who looked like the man who had shown him his room the day before, and then he saw a visitor eyeing him, and doubted whether he was in this instance doing right. Finally he went out and took chance 'buses to their destinations, and wandered a little in remote, wonderful suburbs and returned. He lunched at a chop house in Islington, and found himself back in the Royal Grand, now unmistakably footsore and London weary, about three. He was drawn towards the drawing-room by a neat placard about afternoon tea.|$|E
