40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{grilling}} and roasting using {{a microwave oven}} on fatty acid profile of chicken and mutton meat was investigated. The lipid content (gravimetric method) and fatty acids composition (gas chromatography) were analyzed in three different treatments and applied on these meats in four replicates and two <b>batches.</b> <b>Cooking</b> losses, internal temperature reached by meat and, consequently, total lipids, increased directly with the cooking time and temperature used. Cooked chicken meat had a lower proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and saturated fatty acids (SFA) than cooked mutton meat. PUFA/SFA ratio decreased in chicken meat and increased in mutton meat by heating. Chicken meat presents more favorable fatty acids profile than in mutton meat. This study implies the great choice for consumer to choose the healthier meat {{in a better way}} of cooking. It is recommended that other researchers should study on the nutritional value of chicken and mutton with other different cooking methods to obtain a better comparison data.

40|$|Abstract. This article {{studied the}} pulp {{contrast}} of reed three-stage counter-current cooking and single-stage cooking, meanwhile analyzed {{the regulation of}} the yield, the hardness of pulps and {{the properties of the}} waste liquor from each cooking stage of reed three-stage counter-current <b>batch</b> <b>cooking</b> with ethanol-water process. The SEM and IR-FT were employed to gain more understanding on the change of lignin on fiber surface and the structural change of lignin separated from waste liquor of each stage. The results show that single-stage cooking need to keep 190 ℃ for 4. 0 hours to get the best results, while the three-stage counter-current cooking need 1. 5 hours more, but the highest temperature fallen by 20 ℃ and the screened pulp yield increased by 3. 9 %, also the Kappa number decreased by 11. In the process of reed three-stage counter-current <b>batch</b> <b>cooking</b> with ethanol-water, the degradation and removal of lignin and glycan occurs mainly in the first stage. After the first stage cooking, most fibroblasts did not reach the fiber separation point and the screened pulp yield is only 38. 7 %. After the second and third stage cooking, the fiber separation became better,the screened pulp yield increased to 49. 72 % and the Kappa number decreased to 25. 6.

30|$|Ultraviolet {{resonance}} Raman spectroscopy (UVRRS) {{was used}} to study the formation of aromatic and/or lignin-carbohydrate (LC) structures at the reducing end groups of O-alkyl-substituted cellulose under conditions simulating the initial phase of kraft pulping. The derivatives studied were methyl cellulose (MC) with degree of substitution (DS) of 1.64 – 1.95, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with DS ∼ 0.6, and a lignin model compound, creosol. The total alkali concentrations in the treatments were 0.1 M and 0.5 M and the sulfidities were 1 %, 10 %, and 30 %. HS− ions and creosol are both strong nucleophiles and they compete for the hot-alkali-generated unsaturated electrophilic reaction sites in the reducing end groups of the polysaccharides. The results indicated that conditions {{similar to those in}} the initial phase of conventional kraft cooking (high OH− and low HS− ion concentrations) increased the aromatic nature of the end groups and conditions similar to those in the initial phase of super <b>batch</b> <b>cooking</b> (low OH− and high HS− ion concentrations) partly inhibited the formation of aromatic and LC end groups.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to evaluate how Eucalyptus globulus and Eucalyptus nitens wood raw materials perform in modified cooking: SuperBatch™ (SB), CompactCooking™ (CC) and Lo-Solids™ (LS). Modified cooking methods {{have been developed to}} improve kraft cooking yield, chemical and energy consumption, bleachability and paper's technical properties. The SB cooking technology needed a 20 – 30 units higher H-Factor than CC and LS to reach the same degree of delignification for both raw materials. The highest screened cooking yields were obtained from conventional <b>batch</b> <b>cooking</b> with E. globulus (approximately + 1 %), and the lowest from <b>batch</b> <b>cooking</b> with E. nitens (approximately - 0. 5 %). For both species, the CC technology tended to produce unbleached pulps with a higher intrinsic viscosity (20 – 50 ml/g). The LS technology produced fibers with the highest fiber wall thickness and fiber saturation point (FSP) values. Modified cooking methods did not affect the water retention value (WRV); however, the different raw materials responded differently. E. nitens pulps presented 0. 15 g/g higher WRVs for both bleached and unbleached pulps than E. globulus pulps. In terms of fiber surface composition, no differences could be attributed to modified cooking methods. The total charge of fibers after LS cooking was slightly higher (~ 10 – 20 mmol/kg) compared to that of fibers after the other cooking methods. From the results, it can be concluded that the modified cooking methods (SB, CC and LS) with a slightly different cooking chemistry do not contribute significantly to yield and other cooking parameters. The differences seen in mill environment within the modified cooking technologies {{can be attributed to the}} equipment design, wood column movement and alkali distribution within the column and control systems. The decision on selection of the technology to produce pulp from E. globulus and E. nitens has to be made based on other than cooking chemistry, rather operation parameters that improve mill process control and runnability of the pulp mill. These parameters are e. g. control and stability of chip feed, liquor to wood ratio and chip column movement. In addition, one can conclude that the main differences in the paper technical properties and fiber characteristics come from differences in fiber cell wall structures between the wood species and mechanical effects of the applied modified cooking technology. The results show that the industrial process conditions such as temperature, alkali charge, free and bound liquor gradients have more important impact than cooking chemistry itself on the pulping and pulp quality...|$|E

40|$|Eucalyptus globulus wood {{originating}} from plantations in Uruguay {{was subjected to}} continuous <b>batch</b> kraft <b>cooking</b> (CBC), applying mill-like conditions. Pulp samples were taken {{at different stages of}} CBC cooking being representative for all three cooking phases. The residual lignin was successfully isolated in a reasonable yield by a new method, the dissolved wood lignin (DWL) protocol, which is based on the total dissolution of ball milled wood and pulp samples in dimethylsulfoxide and N-methylimidazole (DMSO/NMI) followed by precipitation in dioxane/ water to separate lignin and carbohydrate fractions. For comparative reasons, the lignin was also isolated by a conventional mild acidolysis (AL) method. Extensive structural lignin characterization using 1 D and 2 D NMR revealed that the DWL protocol allows the isolation of less altered lignin than the AL method. During bulk and residual delignification, the S/G ratio of lignin remaining in the fibers continuously decreased, while the content of -O- 4 units and phenolic OH groups remained almost unaffected, suggesting that the CBC process permits enhanced delignification efficiency and good bleachability...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{research}} has highlighted an ambiguity in understanding cooking related terminology {{and a number}} of barriers and facilitators to home meal preparation. However, meals prepared in the home still include convenience products (typically high in sugars, fats and sodium) which can have negative effects on health. Therefore, this study aimed to qualitatively explore: (1) how individuals define cooking from 'scratch', and (2) their barriers and facilitators to cooking with basic ingredients. METHODS: 27 semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants (aged 18 - 58 years) living on the island of Ireland, eliciting definitions of 'cooking from scratch' and exploring the reasons participants cook in a particular way. The interviews were professionally transcribed verbatim and Nvivo 10 was used for an inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Our results highlighted that although cooking from 'scratch' lacks a single definition, participants viewed it as optimal cooking. Barriers to cooking with raw ingredients included: 1) time pressures; (2) desire to save money; (3) desire for effortless meals; (4) family food preferences; and (5) effect of kitchen disasters. Facilitators included: 1) desire to eat for health and well-being; (2) creative inspiration; (3) ability to plan and prepare meals ahead of time; and (4) greater self-efficacy in one's cooking ability. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings contribute to understanding how individuals define cooking from 'scratch', and barriers and facilitators to cooking with raw ingredients. Interventions should focus on practical sessions to increase cooking self-efficacy; highlight the importance of planning ahead and teach methods such as <b>batch</b> <b>cooking</b> and freezing to facilitate cooking from scratch...|$|E
40|$|Summary. By <b>batch</b> <b>cooking</b> {{of grain}} {{accumulated}} considerable experimental and production material. However, {{the theory of}} this process has not been developed to the desired extent. It is shown that the mathematical modeling {{of the process of}} cooking the grain batch {{can be used as a}} basis for non-stationary diffusion equation and its numerical solution based on the grid method. It is shown that in addition to non-stationary diffusion process by using the grid method can take into account the temperature processes and the theory of swelling of the starch granules. The values of the activation energy of diffusion bound moisture in grains and the pre-exponential value were determined. To describe the swelling of the starch granules used solutions sufficiently numerous studies, and the selected model based on chemical reaction kinetics of the second order. Elaboration of the model of cooking done on experimental data for wheat grits, and concluded the need to address the gap of the starch granules during swelling and separation of layers of material adjacent to the liquid phase during the entire process until the complete cooking of cereal grits.

40|$|Background: Food {{security}} is of large concern to low-income individuals. Soup kitchens {{aim to serve}} this population, but often operate under limited resources. Although each soup kitchen differs, literature shows that despite providing adequate protein and calories, they are often inadequate in fiber and micronutrients, which are obtained predominantly from fresh fruits and vegetables. These nutritional deficiencies place individuals at risk for anemia, poor wound healing, skin issues, osteoporosis, depression, and birth defects. In Kalamazoo, less {{is known about the}} nutritional quality of soup kitchen meals and the potential nutritional deficiencies in the population they serve. Study Purpose: This study aims to analyze the nutritional content of meals offered at Ministry with Community (MwC), a non-profit soup kitchen and resource center for homeless and low-income individuals in Kalamazoo. Methodology: Five meals were observed, weighed, and analyzed during a week in the summer of 2016. A nutritional assessment was completed using nutrition labels and the Nutritionix database, which pulls information from the USDA National Nutrient Database. Since MwC offered two meals per day, the observed lunches were compared to half the Recommended Dietary Allowances for a 2, 000 calorie diet and 2015 - 2020 USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Results: In addition to food cooked in-house from scratch, each of the lunch meals was supplemented by food donations from the local food pantry, grocery stores, fast food chains, catered events, or religious organizations with a certified kitchen. Each meal evaluated met 90 % or greater of the daily caloric intake recommended for lunch. Cholesterol, vitamin A and vitamin C met daily intake requirements, but fiber, calcium, and iron were low. On days meals were supplemented by outside sources, saturated fats exceeded daily intake. Protein content was variable, but averaged 150 % of the recommended daily value for lunch. Fats consistently exceeded daily intake. Sodium also exceeded daily intake, but exact values were difficult to quantify due to large <b>batch</b> <b>cooking</b> and individual addition. Micronutrients were not measured. Conclusion: Adequate caloric intake alone does not ensure a full nutrient profile. While kitchen staff and client nutrition education are of modest benefit, limited resources and seasonal donations are the true drivers of nutrient content. Further research in this population is warranted to understand the long term health impacts for clients, especially for those with different nutritional needs such as children or pregnant women...|$|E

30|$|The {{pulp and}} paper {{companies}} in Brazil produce mainly short fibers extracted from softwood (eucalyptus) when compared to long fibers (pinus). The predominant process is the chemical pulping, using the kraft process (ca. 80 %). For the short fibers production, usually the wood is charged to the digester {{in the form of}} chips together with fresh cooking liquor (white liquor) from the chemical recovery line. The liquor is an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide. The principal digester systems are discontinuous (batch system) or continuous.

40|$|Latest {{developments}} in chemical pulping have been mainly driven by advances in pulping chemistry, disregarding the phenomena {{that take place}} at the front-end of cooking. In spite of the existence of several concepts and theories, some aspects still remain unclear and {{more research is needed to}} achieve a complete understanding of the process of liquid penetration into wood chips. The objectives of the present thesis were to provide more knowledge on the process of liquid penetration into softwood chips and the factors affecting it, to develop a model of penetration process and to evaluate the efficiency of chip presteaming. It was found that the nature of the liquid and its properties play an important role in determining the efficiency of penetration. By optimizing the process conditions and applying certain "penetration aid" techniques, such as presteaming, it is possible to significantly improve the efficiency of penetration and to achieve a higher final penetration degree. Based on experimental data, a mathematical model was developed for the process of water penetration into softwood chips under isothermal conditions. The model was found to predict accurately the course and final level of penetration of water and fresh cooking liquor (white liquor) into the chips under defined conditions. However, the suggested model cannot be used as a general model for predicting the penetration of spent cooking liquor (black liquor). Chip presteaming was examined from the viewpoint of the chip heating and air escape processes. A three-dimensional model was proposed to estimate the efficiency of heating the single chip by saturated steam. It was shown that the time required to heat the single chip with steam was very short, only a few minutes. However, the process of air removal proceeds considerable slower than chip heating process. Achieving a high degree of air removal may require quite long steaming times, up to an hour, especially with heartwood chips. Complete removal of air, however, may be difficult to achieve, even by applying optimal steaming conditions and long steaming times. The knowledge acquired about the efficiency of penetration and presteaming processes was applied to examine contemporary cooking technology. Presteaming of the chips and application of a higher-pressure profile at the front-end of kraft displacement <b>batch</b> <b>cooking</b> resulted in reductions in the amount of rejects and the kappa number of the bulk pulp as well as improved uniformity of delignification. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{model was}} developed to design a processed infant food product for Thailand. Linear programming {{was used as a}} basis for the model. The model can select not only the raw materials but also the process, taking into consideration the nutritional requirements of infants and the product acceptability. Furthermore, any changes in the raw materials, process and product quality can be easily studied with the model. The model was developed in three consecutive steps. Firstly, the Thai infant's nutritional requirements, and the compositions and costs of suitable indigenous Thai raw materials were included in the linear programming model. Secondly, the effect of heat processing on the destruction of the required nutrients was considered for different processes and the nutritional constraints in the model were modified to allow for the losses during processing. A mixture of raw materials was chosen by the model for each process and the most suitable combination of process and raw materials was selected. Finally, eating qualities were included in the model which enabled the model to select the raw materials not only subject to the modified nutritional constraints but also to the required eating quality. To include the losses of nutrients during heat processing, data on the destruction of nutrients by heat processing were collected from the literature to predict the reaction rate constants at different temperatures. First order reaction kinetics were assumed. The Arrhenius relationship between the reaction rate constant and the reciprocal of the absolute temperature was found to be generally true for the destruction of all vitamins and essential amino acids. The losses of vitamins and amino acids during a process were thus calculated from the Arrhenius relationship using the time and temperature history of the process. By including these losses of nutrients into the nutritional constraints in the model, their effects on the nutritional composition and cost of the formulation were compared for different processes and a choice was made of the most suitable process. Several cooking and dehydration processes which could be used for infant food processing in Thailand were compared and <b>batch</b> <b>cooking</b> followed by drum drying was found to be best. Consumer evaluation of the drum dried product suggested a need for improvement in the taste and colour of the product. Constraints restricting the selection of sugar and of raw materials with strong colours were included in the model, and a more acceptable product was obtained. This model can be used not only to formulate an acceptable mixture of raw materials for any process but also to compare different processes for the production of an acceptable and cheap infant food...|$|E
