40|$|Fifty-five {{specimens}} of <b>bluefish,</b> <b>Pomatomus</b> <b>saltator</b> (Linnaeus, 1766), collected at Cabo Frio (23 ºS, 42 ºW), State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between March 1995 and November 1995, were necropsied to study their infracommunities of metazoan parasites. Sixteen species of metazoan parasites were collected. All fish were parasitized {{by one or}} more metazoan. The digeneans were the majority of the parasite specimens collected, with 44. 2 %, followed by the helminth larval stages (cestodes, acanthocephalans, and nematodes) with 40. 6 %. The Simpson index for all parasite species was 0. 097, indicating lack of dominance by any species in the parasite community. Microcotyle pomatomi Goto, 1899 showed the higher frequency of dominance and mean relative dominance. The parasite species of P. saltator showed the typical overdispersed pattern of distribution. The majority of parasite species showed positive correlation between the host's total body length and prevalence or parasite abundance. Two species, Brachyphallus parvus (Manter, 1947) and Phocanema sp. have differences in their prevalences and abundances in relation to sex of the hosts. The mean diversity in the infracommunities of P. saltator was H'= 1. 243 ± 0. 521, with correlation with the host's total length and without difference between male and female fish. The components of the parasite community of P. saltator showed overall positive association. All pairs confonned by ectoparasites and adult endoparasites species showed signiticant positive association or covariation between their abundances. Five pairs of endoparasites larval species showed positive association or covariation, and two pairs, showed negative association and covariation. The parasite community of P. saltator was dominated by species with high prevalence values, that composed a high number of associations, thus, is considered closer to the interactive type...|$|E

Notable differences in growth rate were observed among systems, with consistently higher rates in the Chesapeake compared to the Coastal Bays. Juvenile growth was also amongst the highest reported in the literature. Likewise, relative cohort contribution varied between systems suggesting that late spawning groups may not consistently utilize the upper Chesapeake, and a spawning group intervening between the spring and summer cohorts may occasionally appear in the coastal region.

50|$|The king {{mackerel}} is a medium-sized fish, typically encountered from 5 to 14 kg, but {{is known to}} exceed 40 kg. The entire body is covered with very small, hardly visible, loosely attached scales. The first (spiny) dorsal fin is entirely colorless and is normally folded back into a body groove, as are the pelvic fins.

Coloration is olive on the back, fading to silver with a rosy iridescence on the sides, fading to white on the belly.

40|$|The {{secretion}} {{of carbon}} dioxide accompanying the secretion of oxygen into the swim-bladder of the bluefish is examined in order to distinguish among several theories which have been proposed to describe {{the operation of the}} rete mirabile, a vascular countercurrent exchange organ. Carbon dioxide may comprise 27 per cent of the gas secreted, corresponding to a partial pressure of 275 mm Hg. This is greater than the partial pressure that would be generated by acidifying arterial blood (about 55 mm Hg). The rate of secretion is very much greater than the probable rate of metabolic formation {{of carbon dioxide}} in the gas-secreting complex. It is approximately equivalent to the probable rate of glycolytic generation of lactic acid in the gas gland. It is concluded that carbon dioxide brought into the swim-bladder is liberated from blood by the addition of lactic acid. The rete mirabile must act to multiply the primary partial pressure of carbon dioxide produced by acidification of the blood. The function of the rete mirabile as a countercurrent multiplier has been proposed by Kuhn, W., Ramel, A., Kuhn, H. J., and Marti, E., Experientia, 1963, 19, 497. Our findings provide strong support for their theory. The unique structure of the gas-secreting complex of the swim-bladder of the <b>bluefish,</b> <b>Pomatomus</b> saltatrix L., is described...|$|R
40|$|SARC 39 was {{designed}} to review assessments for black sea bass (Centropristis striata), sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus), and <b>bluefish</b> (<b>Pomatomus</b> saltatrix). The assessment reports for these three species were provided by email from the SAW Chair (Dr. Terry Smith) before the SARC meeting. The meeting was carried out from the 7 th to the 10 th of June, 2004 at the Northeast Fisheries Science Center, Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The assessment for black sea bass {{was presented to the}} panel on Monday, June 7 th, followed by sea scallop on Tuesday, June 8 th, and bluefish on Wednesday, June 9 th. Discussions proceeded section by section after the presentations. In summary, discussions from the Panel and the meeting participants focused mainly on the appropriateness of the fishery/survey data and the associated uncertainties, the tagging experiment and its modeling, and the stock assessment models and their assumptions and conclusions. Recommendations were given by the Panel on the GLM/GAM approach for a comprehensive analysis for combining all possible data into a standardized index, a more appropriate model for the tagging data, and other issues for model improvement and developing sensible fishery management parameters. There also were discussions concerning the terms of reference from the present assessments and the previous assessments...|$|R
40|$|An {{inventory}} of significant ecological events in West African coastal marine ecosystems {{over the last}} decades has been conducted by combining three approaches: a document review, a survey of fishermen and an analysis of fishery statistics. This method allowed to identify an initial {{series of events that}} took place over the period 1970 to 2014, mainly in Senegal. This series refers to groups or species of fishery interest, of which fluctuations in abundance, either sporadically or in the longer term, have {{had an impact on the}} fisheries that exploit them. These species include Baltic carolinensis, Tassergal (<b>Pomatomus</b> <b>saltator),</b> octopus (Octopus vulgaris), Thai murex (Stramonita haemastoma), West African strombe (Strombus latus) and belt (Trichiurus lepturus). This paper describes and analyzes the events identified during this inventory, in terms of what is known and/or what is perceived. It highlights differences in perception between actors (scientists vs professionals in the fishing sector) and sources of information. These differences invite us to think about strategies to improve our ability to perceive and record the ecological changes occurring in marine ecosystems and to document them in real time. Such reflection is necessary in West Africa as elsewhere, since this knowledge is an essential prerequisite for a better understanding of the functioning of the ecosystems in question and to meet the needs of their management, exploitation and conservation...|$|R
