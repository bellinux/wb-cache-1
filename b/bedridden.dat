5|$|In 1980, the Duchess {{lost the}} power of speech. Toward the end, she was <b>bedridden</b> and did not receive any visitors, apart from her doctor and nurses.|$|E
5|$|Booth was {{the only}} one of the assassins to succeed. Powell was able to stab Seward, who was <b>bedridden</b> as a result of an earlier {{carriage}} accident. Seward was badly wounded but he survived. Atzerodt lost his nerve and spent the evening drinking alcohol; he never made an attempt to kill Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Evers {{suffered}} a stroke in August 1942, which paralyzed {{the right side of}} his body. He remained <b>bedridden</b> or confined to a wheelchair for most of the next five years. Evers died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1947 at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany, and is buried in Saint Mary's Cemetery in Troy.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Tesla {{returned}} to Smiljan. Shortly after he arrived, he contracted cholera, was <b>bedridden</b> {{for nine months}} and was near death multiple times. Tesla's father, {{in a moment of}} despair, (who had originally wanted him to enter the priesthood) promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Clouzot was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis and was sent first to Haute-Savoie and then to Switzerland, where he was <b>bedridden</b> for nearly five years in all. Clouzot's time in the sanatorium would be very influential on his career. While <b>bedridden,</b> Clouzot read constantly and learned the mechanics of storytelling to help improve his scripts. Clouzot also studied the fragile nature {{of the other people}} in the sanatorium. Clouzot had little money during this period, and was provided with financial and moral support by his family and friends. By the time Clouzot left the sanatorium and returned to Paris, World War II had broken out. French cinema had changed because many of the producers he had known had fled France to escape Nazism.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette spoke {{publicly}} {{for the last}} time in the Chamber of Deputies on 3 January 1834. The next month, he collapsed at a funeral from pneumonia. Although he recovered, the following May was wet and, after being caught in a thunderstorm, he became <b>bedridden.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1927, {{the year}} of her 90th {{birthday}}, Cosima's health was failing. The birthday was marked in Bayreuth by the naming of a street in her honour, although she was unaware; the family thought that knowledge of the celebrations would overexcite her. In her last years she was virtually <b>bedridden,</b> became blind, and was only lucid at intervals. She died, aged 92, on 1 April 1930; after a funeral service at Wahnfried her body was taken to Coburg and cremated.|$|E
5|$|Defense {{accounts}} contradicted {{the testimony}} of Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who all said that a man had fired a nickel-plated pistol first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun. (Morgan remained <b>bedridden</b> throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing.|$|E
5|$|Hensley was {{the father}} of eight {{children}} with his first wife, Amanda. They separated in 1922. One of their children claimed that the separation occurred after an incident in which Hensley became drunk and fought a neighbor. Amanda left the area and found work in a Chattanooga hosiery mill but soon became ill and <b>bedridden.</b> Hensley's sister and brother-in-law traveled to Chattanooga to care for her.|$|E
5|$|In 1864, Ewing {{suffered}} {{an attack of}} rheumatism, and received treatment several times thereafter, often being confined to his chair. He was likely prostrated with illness as Commander of Louisville during Burbridge's madness in Kentucky. He was made a brevet major general on March 13, 1865. After leaving the Army, he experienced painful attacks {{for the rest of}} his life, often <b>bedridden</b> for periods of up to forty days.|$|E
5|$|Lilith tells Rachel {{that she}} was murdered by a serial killer. When Rachel confronts him, she finds he is <b>bedridden</b> due to an {{unrelated}} injury caused by Malus months earlier. She kills him, but {{he is able to}} shoot her before he dies. Rachel dies next to his bed, hoping she will finally stay dead. She awakens in the morgue, where Zoe is watching over her.|$|E
5|$|Pharmacological {{treatment}} {{can help to}} manage psychiatric or behavioral problems. Medication {{is also used to}} control post-traumatic epilepsy; however the preventive use of anti-epileptics is not recommended. In those cases where the person is <b>bedridden</b> due to a reduction of consciousness, has to remain in a wheelchair because of mobility problems, or has any other problem heavily impacting self-caring capacities, caregiving and nursing are critical.|$|E
5|$|She lived a long life, and in {{her later}} years often wrote on census forms that she was born later than she {{actually}} was. Shortly before she died in 1884, she suffered a stroke that left her deaf and <b>bedridden.</b> After her death, she was buried along with the ashes of Edward Williams next to Thomas Jefferson Hogg in Kensal Green Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his time}} in the General Assembly, Breckinridge had battled with typhoid fever. In an 1828 letter to his wife, who was visiting {{relatives}} in Virginia, he recounted that he had been <b>bedridden</b> and near death for two months. Finally, in February 1829, the illness subsided. Only then could he be told about the death of his daughter, Louisiana, which had occurred a month earlier. The illness, combined with the news of the death of his daughter, caused Breckinridge to turn to religion.|$|E
5|$|When Barron {{arrived in}} the Mediterranean, his {{seniority}} of rank over Preble entitled him to assume the duties of commodore. However, soon after replacing Preble, Barron went ashore at Syracuse in poor health and became <b>bedridden.</b> Under command of Captain George Cox, President began routine blockade duties of Tripoli {{during the winter months}} of 1804–05. In late April 1805, Constitution captured three ships off Tripoli. President escorted them to port at Malta before rejoining Constitution.|$|E
5|$|With {{the case}} solved, House {{hands in the}} reviews to Cuddy, who discovers they are all the same. House also gives Cuddy a {{performance}} review. As punishment for not doing his team's reviews properly and for breaking the rules she set between him and Amber, Cuddy has {{the two of them}} cleaning up <b>bedridden</b> patients together while outside in the corridor, Wilson smiles to himself, amused at the scene.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Mexico on 20 March, {{the fleet}} {{underwent}} {{three weeks of}} target practice. Rear Admiral Evans was relieved of command during this time, as he was completely <b>bedridden</b> and in constant pain, so on 30 March, Connecticut set sail north at full speed. She was met two days later by the schooner , which took the admiral to a hospital. Connecticut traveled back south to rejoin the fleet, and Rear Admiral Charles M. Thomas took Evans's place on Connecticut as {{the commander of the}} fleet, which continued its journey north, bound for California.|$|E
5|$|Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is a {{kind and}} loving boy living in poverty with his parents (Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter) and four <b>bedridden</b> grandparents. They all rely on his father for income, {{employed}} at a toothpaste factory, responsible for putting the caps on the tubes. However, Mr. Bucket eventually loses his job because the factory replaced him with a machine that puts the caps on the tubes. Down the street is Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) chocolate factory, which reopened after industrial espionage forced him into seclusion and sacking his employees. Charlie's Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) worked for Wonka before the termination.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} stages, {{the patient is}} {{completely}} dependent upon caregivers. Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech. Despite the loss of verbal language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional signals. Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme apathy and exhaustion are much more common symptoms. People with Alzheimer's disease will ultimately {{not be able to}} perform even the simplest tasks independently; muscle mass and mobility deteriorates {{to the point where they}} are <b>bedridden</b> and unable to feed themselves. The cause of death is usually an external factor, such as infection of pressure ulcers or pneumonia, not the disease itself.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, in 1798, a M.Tessier of Versailles {{hospital}} contacted Percy {{to notify}} {{him that a}} patient of theirs wished to see him. It was Tarrare, now <b>bedridden</b> and weak. Tarrare told Percy that he had swallowed a golden fork two years earlier, which he believed was lodged inside him and causing his current weakness. He hoped that Percy could {{find some way to}} remove it. Percy, however, recognised him as suffering from advanced tuberculosis. A month later, Tarrare began to suffer from continuous exudative diarrhoea, dying shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{was also}} {{unable to stop}} those who came to hear him speak from desecrating the Sabbath, and his Yiddish sermons had {{no impact on the}} younger generation. In addition, he had to contend with a number of obstacles: he had no {{administrative}} experience or training, local Orthodox rabbis (particularly Joshua Seigel) and Jews outside his congregation did not accept his authority, and non-Orthodox Jews and groups criticized him. These problems were exacerbated by a stroke suffered in 1895, which partially incapacitated him, followed by a relapse in 1900 which left him <b>bedridden.</b>|$|E
5|$|On the airship, Kain appears {{and demands}} Cecil {{retrieve}} the final crystal {{in exchange for}} Rosa's life, which the party obtains with assistance from a <b>bedridden</b> Edward. Kain then leads the party to the Tower of Zot, where Rosa is imprisoned. At the tower's summit, Golbez takes the crystal and attempts to flee. Tellah casts Meteor to stop Golbez, sacrificing his own life in the process. However, the spell only weakens Golbez, ending his mind control of Kain. Kain helps Cecil rescue Rosa, who teleports the party out of the collapsing tower to Baron.|$|E
5|$|Rita breaks her hip {{while she}} and Brian are having sex. Peter warns Brian that their {{relationship}} will not last much longer {{now that he}} must run errands for her. Brian goes out to pick up medicine for <b>bedridden</b> Rita, but is distracted {{by the sight of}} a group of young women entering a bar. One of them offers to have sex with Brian in the bathroom, after which he returns with her medicine. Realizing that he still loves Rita, he admits his infidelity. However, Rita decides he is far too young for her and breaks off their engagement. A regretful Brian understands that it is for the best and leaves her.|$|E
5|$|Zinta {{was born}} in a family from Rohru in Shimla district, Himachal Pradesh. Her father, Durganand Zinta, was an officer in the Indian Army. He died in a car {{accident}} when she was 13years old; the accident also involved her mother, Nilprabha, who was severely injured and consequently remained <b>bedridden</b> for two years. Zinta called the tragic accident and her father's death a significant turning point in her life, which forced her to mature rapidly. She has two brothers; Deepankar and Manish, a year older and a year younger respectively. Deepankar is a commissioned officer in the Indian Army, while Manish lives in California.|$|E
5|$|After {{a memorable}} 90th birthday, {{where she was}} {{surrounded}} by her now vast family, Zita's strong health began to fail. She developed inoperable cataracts in both eyes. Her last big family gathering took place at Zizers, in 1987, when her children and grandchildren joined in celebrating Empress Zita's 95th birthday. While visiting her daughter, in summer 1988, she developed pneumonia {{and spent most of}} the autumn and winter <b>bedridden.</b> Finally, she called Otto, in early March 1989, and told him she was dying. He {{and the rest of the}} family travelled to her bedside and took turns keeping her company until she died in the early hours of 14 March 1989. She was 96 years old, and was the last surviving child of Robert, Duke of Parma from both his marriages.|$|E
5|$|Clouzot was {{an early}} fan of the cinema and, {{desiring}} {{a career as a}} writer, moved to Paris. He was later hired by producer Adolphe Osso to work in Berlin, writing French-language versions of German films. After being fired from German studios due to his friendship with Jewish producers, Clouzot returned to France, where he spent years <b>bedridden</b> after contracting tuberculosis. Upon recovering, Clouzot found work in Nazi occupied France as a screenwriter for the German-owned company Continental Films. At Continental, Clouzot wrote and directed films that were very popular in France. His second film Le Corbeau drew controversy over its harsh look at provincial France and Clouzot was fired from Continental before its release. As a result of his association with Continental, Clouzot was barred by the French government from filmmaking until 1947.|$|E
5|$|In Serbia, the {{government}} was again favourable towards the Bulgarian revolutionaries' aspirations and allowed them to establish in Belgrade the Second Bulgarian Legion, an organisation similar to its predecessor and its goals. Levski was a prominent member of the Legion, but between February and April 1868 he suffered from a gastric condition that required surgery. <b>Bedridden,</b> he could {{not participate in the}} Legion's training. After the Legion was again disbanded under political pressure, Levski attempted to reunite with his compatriots, but was arrested in Zaječar and briefly imprisoned. Upon his release he went to Romania, where Hadzhi Dimitar and Stefan Karadzha were mobilising revolutionary detachments. For various reasons, including his stomach problems and strategic differences, Levski did not participate. In the winter of 1868, he became acquainted with poet and revolutionary Hristo Botev and lived with him in an abandoned windmill near Bucharest.|$|E
5|$|In early May 1895, Abu Bakar {{travelled}} to London {{together with}} his son and successor, Tunku Ibrahim (later Sultan Ibrahim) with the hope to mustering support and recognition of his rule. He was by then already very ill and was already suffering from an inflammation of the kidneys for sometime and diagnosed with Bright's disease (a type of kidney disease). At the onstart of the voyage in early May, he became very weak, {{and had to be}} carried aboard a ship in a wheelchair. He reached London on 10 May, and checked into Bailey's Hotel but was <b>bedridden</b> throughout his remaining days. He was not allowed to receive many visitors, though the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, Prince Arthur paid two visits. Queen Victoria sent her personal physician, Douglas Powell to attend to his medical needs upon receiving news of his illness.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of his contribution to the battles at Saratoga, General Arnold had his seniority restored (he had lost it after being passed over for promotion earlier in 1777). His leg wound left Arnold <b>bedridden</b> for five months. Later, while still unfit for field service but serving as military governor of Philadelphia, Arnold entered into treasonous correspondence with the British. He received command of the fort at West Point and plotted to hand {{it over to the}} British, only to flee into the British lines when the capture of his contact John Andre led to the exposure of the plot. Arnold went on to serve under William Phillips, the commander of Burgoyne's right wing, in a 1781 expedition into Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Madeline Sylvia Royals {{was born}} on 8 January 1910 in Blackpool, Lancashire. Little is known of her early life, which coincided with Britain's {{involvement}} in the First World War, although she appears {{to have had a}} strained relationship with her parents. Her father, Willie Royals, was an insurance agent, while her mother, Marion Neruda Shaw, was a tailor's daughter from Oldham. Willie and Marion had married on 28 June 1909, followed by Madeline's birth seven months later. In early life, Madeline was afflicted with polio, resulting in a lifelong withered leg and limp. <b>Bedridden</b> for the course of the illness, she read literature to entertain herself, enjoying the works of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, H.Rider Haggard and E.T.A. Hoffman. She also read the Bible in her youth, becoming particularly enamored with the texts of the Old Testament, and was convinced that they contained secret messages, a theme that became a central tenet of her later Luciferian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Walt's wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) observes {{his car in}} her {{driveway}} and, not wishing her son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte) to see it, drives it a {{few blocks}} away to conceal it. Concerned about Walt's apparent disappearance, she calls their lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), but he has become paranoid from Walt's falling out with Gus and is too busy checking his office for listening devices. Skyler hires a locksmith to break into Walt's condo for her, claiming it belongs to her. When he hesitates to do so without identification, Skyler claims her purse was stolen and fakes a panic attack until he finally agrees. She finds little of interest inside the condo. Elsewhere, Skyler's sister Marie (Betsy Brandt) struggles to maintain her composure while caring for her belligerent husband Hank (Dean Norris), who is still <b>bedridden</b> after the attempt on his life.|$|E
5|$|Motor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in {{the early}} stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, {{individuals}} are expected to lose independent ambulation after an average of eight years and be <b>bedridden</b> after ten years. However, it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays. Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms, while at the same time it is a new source of disability, because of the undesired effects of levodopa after years of use. In people taking levodopa, the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years. However, it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual. Age is the best predictor of disease progression. The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.|$|E
5|$|On 19 May 2014, {{the news}} {{reported}} that McCartney had been <b>bedridden</b> on doctor's orders {{due to an}} unspecified virus, which forced him to cancel a sold-out concert tour of Japan that was scheduled to begin later in the week. The tour would have included {{a stop at the}} famed Budokan Hall. McCartney also had to push his June US dates to October, as part of his doctor's order to take it easy to make a full recovery. However, he resumed the tour with a high-energy three hour appearance in Albany, New York, on 5 July 2014. On 14 August 2014, McCartney performed the final concert at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, California before its demolition. It was the same venue that the Beatles played their final concert in 1966.|$|E
5|$|When {{his brother}} and {{sister-in-law}} were forced to move for business reasons, he bought his own house at 328 Mickle Street (now 330 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard). First {{taken care of by}} tenants, he was completely <b>bedridden</b> for {{most of his time in}} Mickle Street. During this time, he began socializing with Mary Oakes Davis—the widow of a sea captain. She was a neighbor, boarding with a family in Bridge Avenue just a few blocks from Mickle Street. She moved in with Whitman on February 24, 1885, to serve as his housekeeper in exchange for free rent. She brought with her a cat, a dog, two turtledoves, a canary, and other assorted animals. During this time, Whitman produced further editions of Leaves of Grass in 1876, 1881, and 1889.|$|E
5|$|By 1960, Carson {{had more}} than enough {{research}} material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her <b>bedridden</b> for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of Silent Spring. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a mastectomy. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was in fact malignant and the cancer had metastasized. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of The Sea Around Us, and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann. Most of the research and writing {{was done by the}} fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on biological controls and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.|$|E
5|$|Carlo Maggi, a Catholic {{acquaintance}} of Momolo's {{who was also}} a retired judge, sent a report of Lepori's refutation to Scazzocchio, who asked Antonelli to pass it on to the Pope. A cover letter attached to Maggi's statement described it as proof that Morisi's story was false. Scazzocchio also forwarded an affidavit from the Mortara family doctor, Pasquale Saragoni, who acknowledged that Edgardo had fallen sick when he was about a year old, but stated that he had never been in danger of dying, and that in any case Morisi had been herself <b>bedridden</b> at the time she was supposed to have baptised the boy. A further report sent from Bologna in October 1858, comprising the statements of eight women and one man, all Catholics, corroborated the doctor's claims about the sicknesses of Edgardo and Morisi respectively, and alleged that the former maid was given to theft and sexual impropriety. Four women, including the servant Anna Facchini and the woman who had employed Morisi after she left the Mortaras, Elena Pignatti, claimed that Morisi had regularly flirted with Austrian officers and invited them into her employers' homes for sex.|$|E
