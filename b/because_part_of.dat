5|$|The highway's {{northern}} section {{begins at}} a cloverstack interchange with Interstate 44 in Bethany. The {{first part of}} the northern section is a freeway, called the Lake Hefner Parkway <b>because</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> it runs along the east shore of Lake Hefner. The freeway, {{a major part of the}} Oklahoma City freeway system, serves the northwestern part of Oklahoma City. The freeway ends at 164th Street, and Highway 74 continues northward on Portland Avenue.|$|E
5|$|In {{his spare}} time, Wright {{developed}} a fruit farm {{on the property}} with over a thousand fruit trees and bushes that he ordered from Jens Jensen in 1912. It is unknown exactly how many were planted, <b>because</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the order was destroyed during a railroad strike. Wright requested two hundred and eighty-five apple trees planted, including one hundred McIntosh, fifty Wealthy, fifty Golden Russet, and fifty Fameuse. Among the bushes were three hundred gooseberry, two hundred blackberry, and two hundred raspberry. The property also grew pears, asparagus, rhubarb, and plums. The fruit and vegetable plants were placed along the contour of the estate, {{which may have been}} done to mimic the farms he saw while in Italy. Wright also dammed a creek on the property to create an artificial lake, which was stocked with fish and aquatic fowl. This water garden, probably inspired by the ones he saw in Japan, created a natural gateway to the property.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why Burt made such an unusual will, but {{newspaper}} records suggest family feuds were likely {{at the core of}} his decision. The will was challenged by his children after he died. A legal hole was found in 1920 <b>because</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the estate was composed of iron leases in Minnesota, and Minnesota had a law against trusts of such long standing. This portion of the estate, amounting to $5 million, was distributed to Burt's children and grandchildren (a son, three daughters and four granddaughters). In 1961, an additional $720,000 was taken from the trust in settlement of a suit filed by nine heirs and the estates of three other descendants.|$|E

5|$|Also {{contained}} in Hemming's {{work is a}} description of the lawsuit between the diocese of Worcester and Evesham Abbey, which took place between 1078 and 1085. Although only Hemming relates the course of the proceedings, the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, or Evesham Chronicle, also gives background information on the dispute. The litigation involved lands that the abbey held in Hampton and Bengeworth in Worcestershire, but that the diocese maintained were actually part of one of the bishopric's manors. Ownership became disputed under the abbacy of Æthelwig, when the abbot managed to acquire the allegiance of a number of the new owners of lands previously held from the diocese. After Æthelwig's death, most of these lands passed to Odo of Bayeux, but Evesham managed to retain Hampton and Bengeworth, which became the basis of the dispute. The lawsuit was complicated <b>because</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the land had been granted by an earlier bishop, Beorhtheah, to a kinsman, Azur. After the Conquest, Azur's lands were given to Urse d'Abetot, the Sheriff of Worcester. Following Æthelwig's death, Wulfstan was able to secure a settlement with Æthelwig's successor Walter. The settlement, which was concluded in 1086, granted the lands to the abbey, but the diocese was the overlord of the lands, for which the abbey owed military service.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the B-series trains were {{delivered}} for trial runs on 7 March 2001. In May, NSB stated {{that they would never}} be able to operate the trains with the speeds they had previously stated they could, and that at least for the next year, the tilting trains would operate at the same speeds as conventional trains. On 17 September 2001, the trains were put into service on the Bergen Line between Oslo and Bergen. During the following winter, the trains had problems running through snowdrift unless they were running at a sufficiently high speed. <b>Because</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Bergen Line had frost heave, trains were forced to drive extra slowly, causing trains to get stuck. NSB stated that tests had shown that Class 73 was better able to do this than El 16, which had previously been the main locomotive on the line, although Class 73 did not do as well as the modern El 18. In January 2002, NSB started rebuilding the A-series trains with a larger baggage compartment. This was largely because of insufficient space for passengers to take skis with them.|$|E

25|$|The Umayyads delayed {{their attack}} to so {{late in the}} year {{probably}} <b>because</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the army needed to live off the land as they advanced.

25|$|On January 21, 2011, a $900,000 {{check was}} posted with Travis County that {{permitted}} grading to begin.

25|$|An {{invitation}} for tenders was issued in 1947. Ateliers de Constructions Electriques de Charleroi offered to build a European adoption of the PCC streetcar, although the necessary licenses for Scandinavia were held by Svenska Järnvägsverkstäderna. The trams met all of Oslo Sporveier's demands, except their high power usage. However, the downside was the high price and that foreign production would require currency exchange licenses, which could be complicated <b>because</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the price was for royalties.|$|E

25|$|Historically, Silesia was bounded to {{the west}} by the Kwisa and Bóbr Rivers, while the {{territory}} west of the Kwisa was in Upper Lusatia (earlier Milsko). However, <b>because</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Upper Lusatia {{was included in the}} Province of Silesia in 1815, in Germany Görlitz, Niederschlesischer Oberlausitzkreis and neighbouring areas are considered parts of historical Silesia. Those districts, along with Poland's Lower Silesian Voivodeship and parts of Lubusz Voivodeship, make up the geographic region of Lower Silesia.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Chinese arms {{supplies}} may be underestimated, both <b>because</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> these weapons come to Africa via indirect ways, or through uncounted exchanges of arms for raw materials, or because Chinese sales numbers are biased downwards. In Liberia, from 2001 to 2003, against a UN weapon embargo, Chinese weapons were purchased by Van Kouwenhoven, from the Netherlands, to supply Charles Taylor's army {{in exchange for}} lumber. In Zimbabwe, Mugabe bought $240m of weapons, while Sudan received civil helicopters and planes which were later militarized on site.|$|E
25|$|By 1620, Mataram's main target shifted {{towards the}} city of Surabaya itself. From 1620 to 1625, Mataram forces {{periodically}} besieged Surabaya. The siege was difficult <b>because</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Surabaya (including the ducal palace) was located between branches of the River Brantas, {{and it was in}} many parts surrounded by swampland, which formed a natural fortification and health risk for besiegers. In addition, the city was walled and fortified with cannons. Surabaya's position as a port city made it necessary for Mataram to blockade Surabaya by sea and by land. Logistical limitations and annual rainy seasons prevented Mataram from maintaining a continuous siege. Instead, Mataram followed a pattern of attacking during the dry season, destroying crops and pillaging harvests from the areas surrounding Surabaya.|$|E

25|$|The Sants–La Sagrera tunnel {{links the}} Sants station in Barcelona through the Eixample {{with the future}} La Sagrera station. The tunnel passes under the streets of Provença and Mallorca, using a short part of the Diagonal to link between these streets. In the Carrer de Mallorca, the tunnel passes {{directly}} in front of Gaudí's masterpiece, the basilica of the Sagrada Família, and in the Carrer de Provença, another Gaudí work, the Casa Milà. In a long campaign against this route, the Board of the Sagrada Família and other parties argued that the tunnel would damage the church, whose construction is still in progress. In this discussion about different routes, the one now built is also called the Provença tunnel <b>because</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> its route passes under this street.|$|E
25|$|Hannibal either took Geronium by assault {{after his}} terms had been refused by the townsfolk, or he simply took {{possession}} of the town because the inhabitants had fled after burning the town buildings, <b>because</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the town wall had collapsed, making it vulnerable. The Carthaginians turned the town into a large granary for storing their grain and housing their animal herds, then set up a camp outside the town to billet the army, and finally surrounded {{the town and the}} camp with a trench and palisade. While the sick and wounded recovered in the camp, thousands of foragers fanned out throughout the plain to harvest crops while others pastured their cattle and horses on the mountainside. Two thirds of the army was employed in these operations while the rest guarded the camp.|$|E

[...] intersperses his basslines with countermelodies and answers to what Duke plays." [...] According to drummer Terri Lyne Carrington, [...] "Backward Country Boy Blues" [...] was probably given its title <b>because</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the usual blues construction is reversed – the V chord precedes the IV chord.|$|E

500|$|Industrial {{development}} had to {{take place}} relatively soon after the new town was established <b>because</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Corporation's remit was to move people and jobs out of an overcrowded and war-damaged London. Industrial jobs were needed as well as houses and shops to create a balanced community where people could settle. The Development Corporation wanted the new town to support a large and mixed industrial base, with factories and other buildings based in a single zone rather than spread throughout the town. A [...] site in the northeastern part of the development area was chosen. Its advantages included flat land with no existing development; proximity to the London–Brighton railway line, the A23 and the planned M23; space for railway sidings (which were eventually built on a much smaller scale than envisaged); and an adjacent [...] site reserved for future expansion, {{on the other side}} of the railway line (again, not used for this purpose in the end). Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) opened the first part of the industrial area on 25 January 1950; its main road was named Manor Royal, and this name eventually came to refer to the whole estate.|$|E
500|$|Into {{the reign}} of King George III (1760–1820), the silver penny {{continued}} to be used mostly as a Maundy piece. Pennies {{similar to those of}} previous reigns, but bearing George III's head and the inscription GEORGIVS III DEI GRATIA, were struck in 1763, 1766, 1770, 1772, 1776, 1779, 1780, 1781, 1784 and 1786. A new bust of the King was introduced to the penny in 1792, and was struck dated that year, 1795, and 1800. The third, laureated bust of the king with an unchanged obverse inscription was on the silver penny in 1817, 1818 and 1820. George III's first reverse, used until 1780, showed the crowned [...] "I" [...] in high relief, with the inscription MAG BRI FR ET HIB REX. [...] A modification was made in 1781, with the relief of the central [...] "I" [...] on the reverse lowered, likely <b>because</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the outline of the I had been visible on the King's head {{on the other side of}} the coin. This second reverse, used until 1786, was similar but in lower relief, the [...] "I" [...] being much flatter; the third reverse, used in 1792 only, was completely redesigned with a much smaller [...] "I" [...] under a smaller crown with the inscription running around the crown, with the same legend as before. The fourth reverse, used in 1795 and 1800 was similar to the first but with a redesigned crown. The fifth reverse, used from 1817, showed the crowned [...] "I" [...] with the inscription BRITANNIARUM REX FID DEF and the date. From 1817, the diameter of the coin was reduced from 12 to 11 millimetres, although the weight remained the same at [...]5 grams.|$|E
