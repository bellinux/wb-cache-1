5000|$|Every year, {{hundreds}} of beachgoers are accidentally stung by round stingrays {{along the coast}} of southern California. The sting is not fatal, though it is quite painful. The so-called [...] "Ray Bay" [...] at the northern end of Seal Beach, used as a nursery ground by round stingrays, is the most notorious location for these incidents.

During the 1990s, an average of 226 bathers were stung per year on Seal Beach, with the number of incidents rising during warmer El Niño years. Recently, local authorities and scientists have <b>begun</b> <b>tagging</b> the stingrays and clipping their spines in an effort {{to reduce the number of}} injuries. However, there is little evidence that this program has been successful, likely due to the large population of the rays, their itinerant nature around the region, and their annual spine replacement.|$|R
