40|$|The <b>BioGenerator</b> is a {{promising}} energy storage solution {{that can be}} integrated with renewable power sources (i. e. wind and solar) to compensate the intermittent shortage of the renewable power sources and deliver a comprehensive power package. A trickling-bed bioreactor {{was considered to be}} used in the <b>BioGenerator</b> as an alternative to the initially studied ”air-lift” type bioreactor. Trickling-bed bioreactor is well known for its low power consumption for oxygen transfer. Dynamic study was conducted on lab scale trickling-bed bioreactor to investigate the effect of the ferrous iron feed interruption on the iron biooxidation rate. The study showed that the iron biooxidation rate was temporary reduced by around 6 % when the stoppage period was between 16 and 72 hours. Also, a detailed cost analysis study was conducted to for 1 MW <b>BioGenerator</b> showing that its cost is very competitive option of energy storage, and can be used as an economical alternative to rechargeable batteries usually used with renewable power generation sources. The annualized capital cost of the <b>BioGenerator</b> is $ 209, 000 /year, the capital cost per kW is $ 3, 000 /kW, and the cost of electricity due to the <b>BioGenerator</b> is 6. 2 cents per kWh...|$|E
40|$|For {{the time}} being {{transfer}} from the fossil fuel powered electricity generation technologies to renewable sources is facing {{a great deal of}} challenges, because of their intermittent nature. Efficient ways of electricity storage are essential to make it happen, and our electro-biotechnology - the <b>BioGenerator</b> - may be a potential solution, due to its uniqueness consisting in employing iron oxidizing microorganisms. This work presents a scale-up of the <b>BioGenerator</b> from 1 W to 300 W capacity in a stepwise manner. It involved the design, study and scale-up of the airlift bioreactor from 1. 4 to 600 L, and electrochemical cells with different catholyte flow patterns from 4 x 4 cm (1. 6 W) to a stack of 20 x 20 cm cells (271 W). An impact of different operating regimes and the catholyte characteristics on the electrochemical cell performance was studied. Based on the experimental results collected over the course of this Ph. D. research project, the largest and most advanced system to date - 10 kW <b>BioGenerator</b> - was designed and currently is under construction. Oxygen mass transfer and microbial dynamics in the large-scale bioreactors (400 and 600 L) were studied and extraordinary resilience of L. ferriphilum dominated culture was observed. It was found that it takes ~ 5. 5. days for the bacteria to recover and resume their iron oxidizing ability even after 5 months of starvation. An array of commercially available proton exchange membranes was tested in terms of their suitability for the use in the <b>BioGenerator,</b> and Selemion HSF was found to be the best amongst them. The straight forward techniques for the synthesis of Nafion- and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) -based membranes were proposed. The proton conductivity, water transport and ferric ion diffusion through the synthesized membranes were measured. Testing in the Fe 3 +/H 2 electrochemical cell revealed that the most promising, in terms of both performance and economics, amongst them is a phosphorylated PVA membrane. A mathematical model describing the operation of the <b>BioGenerator</b> system was developed and successfully tested during validation experiments. The data predicted was in a fairly good agreement with the experimental...|$|E
40|$|The <b>BioGenerator</b> as a {{fundamentally}} {{new type of}} H 2 -to-electricity conversion system offers a quite sustainable and cost effective solution to the challenges {{associated with the use}} of fuel cells in renewable power grids. The development of an anode electrode for the <b>BioGenerator</b> was subject of this work. The unique features of the <b>BioGenerator</b> require unique electrodes, and more specifically anode. The combination of biological cathodic liquid and the hydrogen gas fuel require specific hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of the anode. Several different methods for anode formation were studied. The spreading technique was found to be most appropriate for the conditions in the BioGnerator. It was employed to fabricate three-layer hydrophobic PTFE-bound anode electrodes. The reproducibility, durability and performance stability of the mentioned electrodes were studied using i-V curves, ex-situ cyclic voltammetry, and through-plane gas permeability. In addition, the effect of hydrophobic polymer content (PTFE) in the backing substrates, including woven-fiber carbon cloth and nonwoven-fiber carbon papers, on the gas permeability, hydrophobicity, and long-term durability of anode electrodes was studied. Results showed that woven-fiber carbon cloth impregnated with 80 - 100 wt. % PTFE gives an enhanced durability towards flooding in the course of continuous operation at 100 mA cm- 2. Moreover, causes of failure in the performance of the anode electrodes were assessed and results showed that the mass transfer is the main source of limitation in the long-term operation...|$|E
40|$|Cardialen {{develops}} low-energy implantable cardioverter {{devices to}} treat cardiac arrhythmias. Its primary {{focus is on}} atrial fibrillation (AF); its secondary focus on ventricular fibrillation (VF). AF affects over 3 {{million people in the}} US and over 20 million worldwide. It doubles the risk of all cause mortality, significantly increases the risk of stroke and contributes to high healthcare costs. Cardialen will develop, test and commercialize its novel pain-free implantable atrial cardioverters independently, opening a new market segment in AF management. In the more established ICD market, it plans to commercialize its technology in industry partnerships. Current AF therapies are described as having “limited long term success and significant risks. ” With 50 % refractory to long term drug therapy and with catheter ablation unable {{to meet the needs of}} growing patient numbers, pain-free internal cardioversion therapy will give physicians a new option. Since AF patients typically remain conscious in episodes, pain-free therapy is essential. Cardialen holds an exclusive global joint license from Washington University and Case Western Reserve University to pain-free cardioversion technology developed by Igor Efimov, phd. The company is currently engaged in pre-clinical trials at Washington University School of Medicine. Cardialen has closed on second round financing through the St. Louis Arch Angels, <b>biogenerator</b> and others to complete current studies and take it to Series A first-in-man studies.

40|$|Rotting plants {{give off}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{which can help}} to control pests of stored grain. Putting decomposing {{vegetable}} matter with stored grain provides a cheap pest control system. Maintaining high concentrations of CO 2 in grain stores is a well known technique for protecting grain in large silos, as CO 2 is lethal to most insects. However, the system requires huge amounts of CO 2 to be pumped into the stores, {{so it is not}} a very practical method for small storage containers. Now Israeli scientists working with researchers in Costa Rica, have developed a simple system for generating CO 2 and transferring it to small containers. Small bins, which hold about 200 kg of grain, have a 10 litre container placed on top and the two are connected with a length of hose pipe. The smaller container becomes the <b>biogenerator</b> and holds waste vegetable matter which gradually decomposes and produces CO 2. CO 2 is heavier than air and sinks through the pipe into the lower storage container full of grain. In trials in Costa Rica, chopped sugarcane and bananas decomposed to produce CO 2 which protected stored maize grains. In Israel, chopped maize and sorghum stems were used to generate CO to protect wheat. Within seven days very high mortality of pests such as the red flour beetle and the maize weevil, was achieved.
