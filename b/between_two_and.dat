This has sometimes led to accusations of sharing confidential information or re-packaging a competitor's tactics as best practices.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1876, several {{bills were}} {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives {{in an effort to}} resume the free coinage of silver. One such bill introduced into the House by Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri was passed in the fall of 1876. Republican senator William B. Allison of Iowa added important amendments to the bill in the Senate. The House bill allowed Free Silver; one of Allison's amendments struck that provision. This same amendment allowed for the issuance of silver certificates {{for the first time in}} United States history. The bill was vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes. The president's veto was overridden on February 28, 1878. What came to be known as the Bland–Allison Act required that the Treasury purchase <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> four million dollars' worth of silver per month, to be coined into silver dollars at the former gold/silver value ratio of 16:1, meaning that one ounce of gold would be valued the same as sixteen ounces of silver.|$|E
5|$|Clutches contain <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> six eggs, {{typically}} {{three or}} four. Variation in clutch size {{depends on the}} amount of food available for young birds. Presumably owing to the greater availability of food, clutches are larger during the peak of the breeding season, and in more southern latitudes of the Cape sparrow's range. Both birds of a pair incubate the eggs during the day, switching every ten or fifteen minutes. At night, only the female incubates the eggs, while the male roosts outside or in the nest. In pairs breeding outside of colonies, birds leave the nest to make room for their mates upon hearing their mates approaching. Among colonial pairs, the incubating bird waits until its partner arrives in the nest, to prevent other birds from entering the nest. Incubation seems to begin before the clutch is complete, and lasts 12–24days.|$|E

5|$|Cyathus olla has -shaped spores with {{dimensions}} of 10–146–8µm. In 1927, George Willard Martin examined the microscopic features of {{various members of}} the Nidulariaceae family, including Cyathus olla. He noted that in this species, the basidia—spore-bearing cells—are club-shaped or cylindrical and have long stems, and they sometimes have a clamp connection at the basal end of the structure. Basidia typically hold <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> four sessile spores that are directly attached to the basidium, rather than via a sterigma. Revealed only after the spore is separated, a temporary apiculus marks the point of attachment. The spores are generally separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize; this basidial breakdown typically occurs simultaneously with a gelatinization of cells lining the inside wall of the peridiole. After separating from the basidia the outer wall of the spores may thicken, although they generally do not increase in size.|$|E
5|$|Dominant bulls follow {{groups of}} cows during the rut, from August into early winter. A bull will defend his harem of 20 cows or more from {{competing}} bulls and predators. Only mature bulls have large harems and breeding success peaks at {{about eight years}} of age. Bulls <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> four years and over 11 years of age rarely have harems, and {{spend most of the}} rut on the periphery of larger harems. Young and old bulls that do acquire a harem hold it later in the breeding season than do bulls in their prime. A bull with a harem rarely feeds and he may lose up to 20 percent of his body weight. Bulls that enter the rut in poor condition are less likely to make it through to the peak conception period or have the strength to survive the rigors of the oncoming winter.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} A.subrubescens are usually solitary, but {{sometimes}} several (typically <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> eight) are stuck {{together by the}} stem bases or {{on the sides of}} their caps. A strictly terrestrial species, it is not found fruiting on wood. It prefers to grow in pine woods, but has occasionally been associated with silver fir in Europe; fruit bodies associated with the latter tree species tend to be less robust than those found growing with pine. It is suspected that A.subrubescens may be mycorrhizal with two- and three-needle pines (i.e., those species that have their needles attached in bundles of two or three), although its ecological preferences are not known with certainty. Ginns, relating a personal communication with David Arora, wrote that Arora encountered several clumps of fruit bodies in an area in California containing mostly knobcone pine (a three-needle pine), manzanita, huckleberry and a few mandrones.|$|E
