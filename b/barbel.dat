5|$|The Japanese {{angelshark}} {{is fairly}} narrow-bodied and has greatly enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins. The skin folds {{along the sides}} of the head lack distinct lobes. The eyes are oval and widely spaced; closely behind are crescent-shaped spiracles with large, boxy projections inside their anterior rims. Each nostril is large and preceded by a small flap of skin bearing two barbels; the outer <b>barbel</b> is thin, while the inner <b>barbel</b> has a spoon-like tip and a smooth to slightly fringed flange at the base. The wide mouth is terminally placed and has furrows at the corners. There are 10 tooth rows on either side of both jaws, separated by a gap in the middle; the teeth are small, narrow, and pointed. There are five pairs of gill slits located {{on the sides of the}} head.|$|E
5|$|The burbot, a {{predatory fish}} native to streams and lakes of North America and Eurasia, is also {{commonly}} mistaken for bowfin. Burbots {{can be distinguished}} by their flat head and chin <b>barbel,</b> long anal fin, and pelvic fins situated beneath the pectoral fins.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it has a}} Sandbach postcode, coarse {{fishing is}} {{available}} in the southeast of Bradwall Civil Parish at Field Farm Fisheries with five pools stocked with <b>barbel,</b> bream, carp, chub, crucian, rudd, roach and tench. The equestrian governing body, British Eventing, holds horse trials in eventing at Manor Farm each year. Plum Tree Farm Riding Centre is the local riding school. Chellebeech Livery Yard is at Springbank Farm.|$|E
50|$|The body is naked (without scales) and elongated. The {{three pairs}} of <b>barbels</b> are the chin (mental) <b>barbels,</b> maxillary <b>barbels,</b> and nasal <b>barbels.</b> No adipose fin is present. The opercle lacks spines.|$|R
50|$|Hybopsis winchelli is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} fish with terminal maxillary <b>barbels</b> at exist in various degrees of development. Some populations have well developed <b>barbels</b> while others have rudimentary <b>barbels.</b> Other populations have <b>barbels</b> that are nonexistent.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Barbels</b> may {{be located}} {{in a variety of}} {{locations}} on the head of a fish. [...] "Maxillary barbels" [...] refers to <b>barbels</b> {{on either side of the}} mouth. <b>Barbels</b> may also be nasal, extending from the nostrils. Also, <b>barbels</b> are often mandibular or mental, being located on the chin.|$|R
5|$|The {{zebra shark}} has a {{cylindrical}} {{body with a}} large, slightly flattened head and a short, blunt snout. The eyes are small and placed {{on the sides of}} the head; the spiracles are located behind them and are as large or larger. The last 3 of the 5 short gill slits are situated over the pectoral fin bases, and the fourth and fifth slits are much closer together than the others. Each nostril has a short <b>barbel</b> and a groove running from it to the mouth. The mouth is nearly straight, with three lobes on the lower lip and furrows at the corners. There are 2833 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2232 tooth rows in the lower jaw; each tooth has a large central cusp flanked by two smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|Vikos-Aoös also {{contains}} a variety of suitable habitats that support dense populations of amphibians and reptiles. Vipera ursinii lives in the subalpine meadows and is considered a threatened taxon. The amphibian alpine newts (Triturus alpestris), living in the alpine lakes of the Tymfi region, mostly in Drakolimni, are associated with local folktales of dragons and dragon battles. Yellow-bellied toads (Bombina variegata) are also common in that same area. Numerous fish, such as brown trout, roach, and <b>barbel</b> {{are to be found}} in the park's rivers. Regarding invertebrate species, due to the structural complexity of the forests and the co-existence of various small biotopes, i.e. streams, ponds, forest openings, rocky sites, dead trees, old pollards, and coppices, a very diverse fauna exists. This occurs especially at the various ecotones, including often very specialized species.|$|E
5|$|The leopard {{catshark}} is {{the smaller}} and slimmer {{of the two}} Poroderma species. The head and snout are short and slightly flattened, with a somewhat pointed snout tip. Each nostril is split into tiny incurrent and excurrent openings by a three-lobed flap of skin in front, of which the central lobe forms a slender <b>barbel</b> that reaches past the mouth. The horizontally oval eyes are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and placed rather high on the head, with a thick ridge running under each. The mouth is wide and arched, with short furrows at the corners extending onto both jaws; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. There are 1830 and 1326 tooth rows {{on either side of}} the upper and lower jaws respectively. The teeth have a narrow central cusp with a pair of small lateral cusplets; those of adult males are slightly more curved than those of females.|$|E
50|$|Aguarunichthys was {{originally}} described {{due to the}} distinctive finger-like projections of the gas bladder. There are three pairs of <b>barbels,</b> one pair of long maxillary <b>barbels</b> and two pairs of shorter chin <b>barbels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Leptodoras {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by its long conical snout and well-developed oral hood {{formed by the}} membranous union of maxillary <b>barbels,</b> paired jaw <b>barbels</b> on the chin, and lip structures. It has fimbriate <b>barbels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Genus Barbus All <b>barbels</b> are of {{the genus}} Barbus but not all Barbus species are <b>barbels.</b>|$|R
5|$|Among {{the nine}} {{underground}} tests, which were carried between 1962 and 1969 and codenamed Anacostia (5.2 kilotons, 1962), Kennebec (<5 kilotons, 1963), Par (38, kilotons, 1964), <b>Barbel</b> (<20 kilotons, 1964), Tweed (<20 kilotons, 1965), Cyclamen (13 kilotons, 1966), Kankakee (20-200 kilotons, 1966), Vulcan (25 kilotons, 1966) and Hutch (20-200 kilotons, 1969), {{the last one}} was most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranium elements. In the dependence on the atomic mass number, the yield showed a saw-tooth behavior with the lower values for odd isotopes, due to their higher fission rates. The major practical problem of the entire proposal was however collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4 of the total amount and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 10−7 of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4 kg rock picked up 7 days after the test. This observation demonstrated the highly nonlinear dependence of the transuranium elements yield {{on the amount of}} retrieved radioactive rock. In order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, shafts were drilled at the site not after but before the test, so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter, through the shafts, to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in the Anacostia and Kennebec tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling; whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.|$|E
25|$|Fishing is {{a popular}} sport on {{many parts of the}} River Teme, with its <b>barbel</b> fishing being {{particularly}} noted.|$|E
25|$|In the Mole Gap between Dorking and Leatherhead {{the river}} {{supports}} populations of chub, dace, <b>barbel,</b> brown trout. Both <b>barbel</b> and brown trout are extremely sensitive to {{water quality and}} pollution. Below Leatherhead the river has historically supported larger predatory fish including chub, perch, pike, and eels, however in recent years chub and eel numbers have begun to decline. North of Esher the old river channel is dominated by floating pennywort, a highly invasive weed, which cuts off all light to the river bed, reducing oxygen levels and resulting in a poor habitat for fish. The Ember flood relief channel has a diverse fish population, including chub, dace, roach, bleak, large pike and <b>barbel.</b> At {{the confluence of the}} Mole and the River Thames at Hampton Court Palace it is possible to catch a wide variety of coarse fish species.|$|E
50|$|Arius {{species have}} {{three pairs of}} <b>barbels,</b> {{including}} the fleshy and cylindrical maxillary <b>barbels</b> and two pairs of mental <b>barbels.</b> The base of the adipose fin is moderately long, about half {{the length of the}} base of the anal fin.|$|R
50|$|The {{dorsal fin}} is located far forward, {{close to the}} head, and is often high and triangular, thus inspiring the common name. The anal fin is {{somewhat}} lengthy, with 26 - 46 rays. Usually, they have two pairs of <b>barbels,</b> maxillary <b>barbels</b> and one pair of chin <b>barbels,</b> though adult Mekong giant catfish have only maxillary <b>barbels.</b> Pangasiids have compressed bodies and single small adipose fins.|$|R
50|$|The {{bodies of}} these fish are {{normally}} naked and elongated. The chin <b>barbels</b> are usually absent, nasal <b>barbels</b> are usually present, {{and there are}} usually two pairs of maxillary <b>barbels.</b> Most of these fish have no adipose fin, and some also lack pelvic fins.|$|R
25|$|The Ain is {{very rich}} in fish, {{including}} trout, in particular Salmo trutta fario; grayling, especially the common grayling Thymallys thymallus; pike, perch, <b>barbel,</b> bream, carp, tench, roach, Eurasian minnow, chub and loach.|$|E
25|$|Recreational {{fishing is}} still popular, {{although}} anglers no longer line the banks {{as they once}} did. There are many fishing clubs that use the river, with catches including <b>barbel,</b> bream, carp, chub, dace, pike, and roach.|$|E
25|$|The lake {{is home to}} 16 {{species of}} fish. These include brown and Ohrid trout, perch, minnow, <b>barbel,</b> grass carp, common carp, crucian carp, tench, roach and others. Ohrid trout was stocked and it {{successfully}} adapted to the environment, making it a popular for fishing.|$|E
50|$|Except for D. macilenta {{which has}} a {{distinctly}} rounded head and snout, the head of Denticetopsis species in profile is acutely triangular overall with a bluntly pointed snout. The eyes are situated {{on the sides of}} the head and are visible from above but not from below. The mouth is inferior, the width from approximately one-half to two-thirds of the length of the head. In most species of Denticetopsis, the medial mental <b>barbels</b> are slightly shorter than the lateral mental <b>barbels,</b> with the latter approximately equal in length to the slender maxillary <b>barbels.</b> However, in C. sauli both pairs of mental <b>barbels</b> are approximately the same length and shorter than the maxillary <b>barbels,</b> and in C. royeroi all three pairs of <b>barbels</b> are approximately the same length.|$|R
50|$|Paraloricaria shows a {{strongly}} flattened body, weak postorbital notches, long and ramified maxillary <b>barbels,</b> and overall, conspicuous fringed <b>barbels.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{fish have}} {{sensitive}} <b>barbels</b> and {{one should have}} the proper substrate for them. To keep their <b>barbels</b> (whiskers) in the best condition one requires the fine gravel that looks like coarse salt. This is available in white and brown, both look good. Beware that fry are difficult to spot on the brown gravel. Gravel with sharp edges will cut their <b>barbels</b> (until they are gone). Their <b>barbels</b> are important for finding food, and should remain healthy.|$|R
25|$|Cods of {{the genus}} Gadus have three rounded dorsal and two anal fins. The pelvic fins are small, with the first ray extended, and are set under the gill cover (i.e. the throat region), {{in front of the}} {{pectoral}} fins. The upper jaw extends over the lower jaw, which has a well-developed chin <b>barbel.</b> The eyes are medium-sized, approximately the same as the length of the chin <b>barbel.</b> Cod have a distinct white lateral line running from the gill slit above the pectoral fin, {{to the base of the}} caudal or tail fin. The back tends to be a greenish to sandy brown, and shows extensive mottling, especially towards the lighter sides and white belly. Dark brown colouration of the back and sides is not uncommon, especially for individuals that have resided in rocky inshore regions.|$|E
25|$|The ichthyofauna {{includes}} 5 fish species: common minnow, Maritsa <b>barbel,</b> brown trout, {{rainbow trout}} and brook trout. The {{limited number of}} species {{is determined by the}} predominant bodies of water— glacial lakes, streams and upper river courses, which are inhabited by few fish species. Most of the fishes are found in the river Rilska.|$|E
25|$|Cod-like fishes are {{a number}} of round benthopelagic species {{belonging}} to the order Gadiformes, such as Atlantic and Pacific cod, morid cod, haddock and pollock, including the highly commercial Alaska pollock. Cod-like fishes are often found in large schools over sandy or muddy bottoms. They have a <b>barbel</b> (fleshy filament) on their lower jaw which they use to detect prey buried in the sand or mud. Some migrate to warm water in winter to spawn.|$|E
25|$|The fish possesses, {{in common}} with almost all Corydoras species, three pairs of barbels—one pair of maxillary <b>barbels</b> and two pairs of rictal <b>barbels.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{fish have}} {{three pairs of}} <b>barbels</b> (they lack nasal <b>barbels).</b> They have strong dorsal and {{pectoral}} fin spines. The adipose fin is small.|$|R
50|$|The {{mouth is}} large, {{and the fish}} also {{possesses}} a pair of short <b>barbels</b> used in hunting. The knifefish, when not hiding away, spends much of its time swimming with its head down and the <b>barbels</b> {{in close proximity to}} the substrate. Combined with its acute eyes, the <b>barbels</b> aid the fish in locating its food.|$|R
25|$|Kannur became {{noted in}} South India for ball badminton, when T.K. Ramakrishnan and Kumaran were playing. A.M. Bharathan created history in weight lifting {{in the early}} fifties. Nelliary Krishnan Nair, the first Malayalee to {{represent}} India (weightlifting) at the first Asian Games held at New Delhi in 1951 is from Kannur.Aryabandhu gymnasium, Thykandy gymnasium, Potheri gymnasium and Cannanore <b>Barbel</b> club where famous training centers in old times for Wrestling, Weightlifting, Body building and boxing.|$|E
25|$|The 1980 World Championships in Athletics was {{the second}} global, {{international}} athletics competition organised by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Hosted from 14 to 16 August 1980 at the De Baandert in Sittard, Netherlands, it featured two events: the women's 400 metres hurdles and the women's 3000 metres run. West Germany's Birgit Friedmann took the first women's world title in the 3000 m, while her East German counterpart <b>Bärbel</b> Broschat became the first women's 400 m hurdles world champion.|$|E
25|$|The fauna {{is adapted}} to {{vegetation}} flooring, but less constant to its limits, due to great mobility; it is rich in species. In forests are present numerous animals of cynegetic interest, including deer, stag, bear, fox, lynx, wild boar, squirrel, and on Someș Valley naturally entered the muskrat. Around artificial lakes live a series of birds (duck, coot, stork), in the Someș Plateau and Transylvanian Plain was colonized the pheasant, and in Turda Gorge area lives the rock eagle. Mountain rivers are populated with trouts, graylings and nases, and in the lower ones with <b>barbel</b> and chub.|$|E
5|$|The pallid sturgeon's snout {{and head}} are {{longer than that}} of the shovelnose sturgeon. In both species, the mouth is located well back from the tip of the snout. Lacking teeth, they use their {{extendable}} mouths to suck up small fish, mollusks, and other food sources from river bottoms. Both species also have four <b>barbels</b> which descend from the snout near the front of the mouth. The <b>barbels</b> are believed to be sensory features to locate food sources. On pallid sturgeon, the two inner <b>barbels</b> are about half as long as the outer ones, while on the shovelnose sturgeon, all four <b>barbels</b> are the same length. The inner <b>barbels</b> of the pallid sturgeon are positioned in front of the outer ones, but those on the shovelnose sturgeon are all located in essentially a straight line. The length and positioning of the <b>barbels</b> {{is one of the best}} ways to distinguish the two species.|$|R
50|$|Physopyxis have an {{extremely}} small size among doradids, not exceeding 3.5 cm SL. Their pectoral fin spine reaches {{the base of}} the anal fin, and the dorsal fin spine is serrated only at the anterior margin of its base. There are three pairs of <b>barbels,</b> one pair of maxillary <b>barbels</b> and two pairs of mental <b>barbels.</b> The dorsal and pectoral fin spines are strongly ossified and well-developed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Barbels</b> {{are often}} fished for food; in some {{locations}} {{they are of}} commercial significance. The roe of <b>barbels</b> is poisonous, however. The large Barbus barbs are also often eaten in their native range.|$|R
