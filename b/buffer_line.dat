50|$|Changes in the {{metabolic}} composition of blood can also affect blood pH. Again, recall from our initial experiment that if strong acid or strong base {{is added to}} the blood sample, pH and bicarbonate concentration will change accordingly, resulting in a titration curve. Hydroxide ions, for example, when added to the solution, will react with free hydrogen ions and increase the pH of the solution. Additionally, hydroxide ions will abstract protons from carbonic acid in solution, causing the bicarbonate concentration to increase. The new position on the diagram following addition of hydroxide ions no longer lies on our original <b>buffer</b> <b>line.</b> However, if the PCO2 is now varied without further addition of strong acid or strong base to the solution, a new <b>buffer</b> <b>line</b> can be determined that lies above and approximately parallel to the original <b>buffer</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

25|$|If it {{is desired}} to save memory, the storage {{can be reduced}} to one array plus 3 <b>line</b> <b>buffers.</b> One <b>line</b> <b>buffer</b> is used to {{calculate}} the successor state for a line, then the second <b>line</b> <b>buffer</b> is used to calculate the successor state for the next <b>line.</b> The first <b>buffer</b> is then written to its line and freed to hold the successor state for the third line. If a toroidal array is used, a third buffer is needed so that the original state of the first line in the array can be saved until the last line is computed.|$|R

50|$|If {{this same}} {{experiment}} is repeated at various partial pressures of carbon dioxide, {{a series of}} points will be obtained. One can draw a line through these points, called the <b>buffer</b> <b>line</b> (Fig. 6).|$|E
50|$|Similarly, in a {{physiologic}} system such as {{a living}} body, removal of protons, for example, by vomiting the acidic contents of the stomach, will result {{in an increase in}} pH and an increase in bicarbonate concentration, bringing the system to a new, higher <b>buffer</b> <b>line.</b> Such a disturbance is called a metabolic alkalosis (Fig. 12). Alternatively, if protons are added to the bloodstream in the form of acidic metabolites, as occurs during diabetic ketoacidosis, then pH will fall, along with bicarbonate concentration. This type of disturbance is called a metabolic acidosis. In the case of metabolic acidosis, the new <b>buffer</b> <b>line</b> lies below the original line.|$|E
50|$|A second key {{concept is}} that {{movement}} along a <b>buffer</b> <b>line</b> must correspond {{to a change}} in PCO2. Thus, like the isopleths, the <b>buffer</b> <b>line</b> as drawn on a typical Davenport Diagram (e.g., Fig 6) is actually the projection of a line existing in three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional plane. As with the isopleths, buffer lines in their actual three-dimensional orientation are confined to the surface representing the values of PCO2, HCO3âˆ’ and pH that satisfy equilibrium for the system. In Fig. 10, the dark red lines are the actual buffer lines in three-dimensional space, while the light red lines are the projections of the buffer lines onto a two-dimensional plane. (We will see later how multiple, parallel buffer lines can be determined for a given system).|$|E

Processor performance is measured in execution time using a dynamic superscalar processor running real-istic benchmarks that include operating system references. The results show that a large dual-ported multi-cycle pipelined SRAM cache with a <b>line</b> <b>buffer</b> maximizes processor performance. A large pipelined cache provides both a low miss rate and a high CPU clock frequency. Dual-porting the cache {{and the use of}} a <b>line</b> <b>buffer</b> provide the bandwidth needed by a dynamic superscalar processor.

50|$|A key {{concept in}} {{understanding}} the Davenport Diagram is to note that as PCO2 is increased, {{the magnitude of the}} resulting change in pH is dependent on the buffering power of the non-bicarbonate buffers present in the solution. If strong non-bicarbonate buffers are present, then they will quickly absorb the vast majority of protons released by the formation of bicarbonate, and pH will change very little for a given rise in bicarbonate concentration. The result will be a <b>buffer</b> <b>line</b> with a very steep slope (Fig. 8). On the other hand, if only weak non-bicarbonate buffers are present (or if no non-bicarbonate buffer is present at all), then a much larger change in pH will be observed for a given change in bicarbonate concentration, and the <b>buffer</b> <b>line</b> will have a slope closer to zero.|$|E

50|$|The <b>buffer</b> <b>line</b> {{can be used}} {{to predict}} the result of varying the PCO2 within a range close to the {{experimentally}} determined points. Additionally, for each experimental point, a titration experiment can be performed in which pH is varied while PCO2 is held constant, and titration curves can be generated for each of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Fig. 7). In the Davenport Diagram, these titration curves are called isopleths, because they are generated at a fixed partial pressure of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5000|$|But {{the goal}} {{foremost}} {{pursued by the}} US was to push the Osage out of areas being settled by European Americans, who began to enter the Louisiana Territory after the US acquired it. The lucrative fur trade stimulated the growth of St. Louis and attracted settlers there. The US and Osage signed their first treaty on November 10, 1808, by which the Osage made a major cession of land in present-day Missouri. Under the Osage Treaty, they ceded 52480000 acre to the federal government. This treaty created a <b>buffer</b> <b>line</b> between the Osage and new European-American settlers in the Missouri Territory. It also established the requirement that the U.S. President had to approve all future land sales and cessions by the Osage.|$|E

40|$|In deep {{sub-micron}} technologies, as {{the wires}} are placed ever closer and signal {{rise and fall}} times go into the sub-nano second region, increased crosstalk has implications on the data throughput and on signal integrity. Depending on the data correlation on the coupled lines, the delay can either decrease or increase. Here we show that in uniform coupled lines, the response for several important switching configurations has a dominant pole characteristic. This allows easy prediction for the average, worst-case and best-case delay of <b>buffered</b> <b>lines.</b> We show that the repeater numbering and sizing can be optimised to deal with crosstalk under different constraints to best match the application.

5000|$|To {{simplify the}} design of {{peripheral}} devices, these relied on the processor. The card reader had no memory buffers, but instead gave the CPU a level-zero (highest priority) interrupt after each individual column of the card had been read. If the CPU did not respond and store the twelve bits of data before another such interrupt indicated that the next column had been read, data would be lost. Similarly, the 1132 printer relied on software on the 1130. When a letter such as [...] came into position, the CPU had to analyze a <b>buffered</b> <b>line</b> of text and assemble an array of bits that would indicate to the 1132 which print positions should be printed with [...] If the CPU could not respond before the [...] rotated out of position, print speed would be severely degraded.|$|R

During {{this time there was}} a considerable reduction in the P^Q. difference between arterial blood and inspired gas caused by an {{increase in}} ventilations. Prolonged CO 2 exposure (24 h) showed that there was some compensation for the acidosis in that plasma bicarbonate concentrations increased substantially. At the same time, however, the PCQ of arterial blood always rose so that the net result was usually only a small increase in pH. Upon return to air, the blood was backtitrated along a <b>buffer</b> <b>line</b> elevated above and parallel to that seen during the initial response to hypercapnia. The fall in arterial blood Pco, during the early stages of recovery often led to pH values higher than those seen in the untreated animal.

40|$|Changes in {{vascular}} pressures, blood respiratory {{properties and}} blood gas transport induced by swimming were investigated in the leopard shark Triakis semifasciata (Girard). In resting sharks, the mean ventral and dorsal aortic pressures (systolic/diastolic) were 6. 8 / 5. 6 kPa and 4. 5 / 3. 9 kPa, respectively, {{and only the}} former were increased significantly during swimming. Swimming also caused a significant decline in venous PQ, (1. 6 to 0. 9 kPa), O 2 content (0. 9 to O^mmoir 1) and percentage O 2 saturation {SOl, 39 to 18 %) but the arterial variables were not affected. A significant decline in venous pH {{and an increase in}} venous ^cc ^ also occurred during swimming but lactate concentration did not increase during or after swimming. An in vivo dissociation curve compiled from blood Po 2 and So 2 data for sharks in the resting, swimming and post-swimming recovery phases shows a mean Px of 2. 04 kPa, as determined by Hill transform-ation. The pH-bicarbonate plot for this fish shows a weak blood buffer capacity of 9. 3 mmoll~ 1 pHunit~ 1 and during swimming the average blood pH and bicarbon-ate concentration follow the <b>buffer</b> <b>line</b> which was not compensated in recovery. Neither oxygenated nor deoxygenated blood pH values were affected by CO 2 equilibration, suggesting the absence of a Haldane effect.

40|$|Abstractâ€”Energy {{efficiency}} plays {{a crucial}} role in the design of embedded processors especially for portable devices with its limited energy source in the form of batteries. Since memory access (either cache or main memory) consumes a significant portion of the energy of a processor, the design of fast low-energy caches has become a very important aspect of modern processor design. In this paper, we present a novel cache architecture for reduced energy instruction caches. Our proposed cache architecture consists of the L 1 cache, multiple <b>line</b> <b>buffers,</b> and a prediction mechanism to predict which <b>line</b> <b>buffer,</b> or L 1 cache to access next. We used simulation to evaluate our proposed architecture and compare it with the HotSpot cache, Filter cache, Predictive <b>line</b> <b>buffer</b> cache and Way-Halting cache.

40|$|Bergen city in Norway is {{presently}} undergoing an enormous population growth. In this respect, Bergen municipality wanted to identify {{all the possibilities}} for densification in the current situation. Therefore, the following issues were evaluated: street network and public transport accessibility, building density, degree of functional diversity, restrictions on (private) properties and current land use plans. Our approach is to analyse the central areas in Bergen in the current situation to discover how the urban transformation {{takes place in a}} natural way. Firstly, we studied the relationship between street network accessibility (with the Space Syntax method), degrees of FSI and GSI on building density (with the Spacematrix method) and degrees of function mix (with the MXI method). Secondly, we wanted to reveal the legal issues that arise from the strong Norwegian property rights. Thirdly, we added the accessibility of public transport lines through the angular step depth in the Space Syntax analysis. We combined all these issues by using GIS. Unlike in earlier research (Ye and van Nes, 2013 and 2014), the <b>buffer</b> <b>line</b> function in GIS was used to correlate building density, function mix and degree of spatial integration. It turns out that the degree of street network integration affects the location of commercial activities and the degree of building density and function mix. When the street network accessibility increases on a local and global level, property owners start to submit plans that exploit their properties to the utmost. The same occurs around public transport stops with frequently running light rail trams. As follows from the theory of the natural urban transformation process, densification can thus be steered by improving the street network accessibility on multiple scale levels, combined with high public transport accessibility.
