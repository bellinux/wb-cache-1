5|$|Long War has {{received}} praise from both video game journalists {{and from the}} developers at Firaxis. It has been downloaded over 840,000 times, by over 500,000 different users. Firaxis took the popularity of Long War to add <b>built-in</b> <b>support</b> for modding into the sequel XCOM 2, and used Long War Studios to provide initial add-ons for the game at release. On 19 January 2017, Long War Studios, now known as Pavonis Interactive, released Long War 2 for XCOM 2.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DSi {{connects to}} the Internet via either its {{built-in}} 802.11b/g Wi-Fi or a Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector; both methods grant access to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. The DSi supports WEP, WPA (AES/TKIP), and WPA2 (AES/TKIP) wireless encryption; only software with <b>built-in</b> <b>support</b> can use the latter two encryption types, as they were {{not supported by the}} DS and DS Lite. Up to six wireless Internet connection profiles can be saved; using the traditional setup method, the first three profiles support WEP encryption, while the remaining three are selectable under a more advanced option, which supports WPA encryption. Under this advanced option, users may access the Wi-Fi Protected Setup method and configure proxy settings. The DSi can automatically detect Nintendo Zone service areas thus preventing the need to manually setup Wi-Fi connections. The service offers demos of upcoming and currently available games, access to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and DSi Shop, and may have location-specific content.|$|E
5|$|While Microsoft largely {{failed to}} {{participate}} in the rise of the Internet in the early 1990s, some of the key technologies in which the company had invested to enter the Internet market started to pay off by the mid-90s. One of the most prominent of these was ActiveX, an application programming interface built on the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM); this enabled Microsoft and others to embed controls in many programming languages, including the company's own scripting languages, such as JScript and VBScript. ActiveX included frameworks for documents and server solutions. The company also released the Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, which had <b>built-in</b> <b>support</b> for internet applications. Later in 1997, Microsoft Office 97 as well as Internet Explorer 4.0 were released, marking the beginning of the takeover of the browser market from rival Netscape, and by agreement with Apple Computer, Internet Explorer was bundled with the Apple Macintosh operating system as well as with Windows. Windows CE 2.0, the handheld version of Windows, was released this year, including a host of bug fixes and new features designed to make it more appealing to corporate customers. In October, the Justice Department filed a motion in the federal district court in which they stated that Microsoft had violated an agreement signed in 1994, and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.|$|E

As of the 2011-2012 school year, standard classes have been re branded College Preparatory B, or CPB classes.|$|R

25|$|Similarly to C# and in {{contrast}} to most other OO languages, Swift offers <b>built-in</b> <b>support</b> for objects using either pass-by-reference or pass-by-value semantics, the former using the class declaration and the latter using struct. Structs in Swift have almost all the same features as classes: methods, implementing protocols, and using the extension mechanisms. For this reason, Apple terms all data generically as instances, versus objects or values. Structs do not support inheritance, however.|$|E
25|$|Although Ogg hadn't reached {{anywhere}} near the ubiquity of the MPEG standards (e.g., MP3/MP4), , it was commonly used to encode free content (such as free music, multimedia on Wikimedia Foundation projects and Creative Commons files) and had started to be supported by a significant minority of digital audio players. Also supporting the Ogg format were many popular video game engines, including Doom 3, Unreal Tournament 2004, , Jets n Guns, , , Stepmania, , Lineage 2, Vendetta Online, Battlefield 2, and the Grand Theft Auto engines, {{as well as the}} audio files of the Java-based game, Minecraft. The more popular Vorbis codec had <b>built-in</b> <b>support</b> on many software players, and extensions were available for nearly all the rest.|$|E
25|$|While the single-tasking DOS had {{provisions}} for multi-sector reads and track blocking/deblocking, {{the operating system}} and the traditional PC hard disk architecture (only one outstanding input/output request {{at a time and}} no DMA transfers) originally did not contain mechanisms which could alleviate fragmentation by asynchronously prefetching next data while the application was processing the previous chunks. Such features became available later. Later DOS versions also provided <b>built-in</b> <b>support</b> for look-ahead sector buffering and came with dynamically loadable disk caching programs working on physical or logical sector level, often utilizing EMS or XMS memory and sometimes providing adaptive caching strategies or even run in protected mode through DPMS or Cloaking to increase performance by gaining direct access to the cached data in linear memory rather than through conventional DOS APIs.|$|E

500|$|Python has {{extensive}} <b>built-in</b> <b>support</b> for arbitrary precision arithmetic. Integers are transparently {{switched from}} the machine-supported maximum fixed-precision (usually 32 or 64 bits), {{belonging to the}} python type int, to arbitrary precision, belonging to the python type long, where needed. The latter have an [...] "L" [...] suffix in their textual representation. (In Python 3, {{the distinction between the}} int and long types was eliminated; this behavior is now entirely contained by the int class.) The Decimal type/class in module decimal (since version 2.4) provides decimal floating point numbers to arbitrary precision and several rounding modes. The Fraction type in module fractions (since version 2.6) provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.|$|E

5000|$|The File Explorer in Windows XP {{does not}} support ZIP64, but the Explorer in Windows Vista does. Likewise, some {{extension}} libraries support ZIP64, such as DotNetZip, QuaZIP and IO::Compress::Zip in Perl. Python's <b>built-in</b> zipfile <b>supports</b> it since 2.5 and defaults to it since 3.4. [...] OpenJDK's <b>built-in</b> java.util.zip <b>supports</b> ZIP64 from version Java 7.

2500|$|Many {{computer}} languages have <b>built-in</b> <b>support</b> for exceptions and exception handling. This includes ActionScript, Ada, BlitzMax, C++, C#, COBOL, D, ECMAScript, Eiffel, Java, ML, Object Pascal (e.g. Delphi, Free Pascal, and the like), PowerBuilder, Objective-C, OCaml, PHP (as of version 5), PL/1, PL/SQL, Prolog, Python, REALbasic, Ruby, Scala, Seed7, Tcl, Visual Prolog {{and most}} [...]NET languages. Exception handling is commonly not resumable in those languages, and when an exception is thrown, the program searches {{back through the}} stack of function calls until an exception handler is found.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{the term}} [...] "van" [...] refers to {{vehicles}} that, like European minibuses, are even larger than large MPVs and are rarely seen being driven for domestic purposes — except for [...] "conversion vans". These possess extremely large interior space {{and are often}} more intended for hauling cargo than people. Most vans use body-on-frame construction and are thus suitable for extensive modification and coachwork, known as conversion. Conversion vans are often quite luxurious, boasting comfortable seats, soft rides, <b>built-in</b> <b>support</b> for electronics such as television sets, and other amenities. The more elaborate conversion vans straddle the line between cars and recreational vehicles.|$|E
