50|$|Boxing Day is {{a holiday}} celebrated {{the day after}} Christmas Day. It {{originated}} in the United Kingdom, and is celebrated {{in a number of}} countries that previously formed part of the British Empire. Boxing Day is on 26 December, although the attached <b>bank</b> <b>holiday</b> or <b>public</b> <b>holiday</b> may take place either on that day or two days later.|$|R
50|$|Although {{there is}} no {{statutory}} right for workers to take paid leave on <b>bank</b> <b>holidays,</b> where paid leave is given (either because the business is closed or for other reasons), the <b>bank</b> <b>holiday</b> can count towards the minimum statutory holiday entitlement. Likewise, if people are required {{to work on a}} <b>bank</b> <b>holiday,</b> {{there is no}} statutory right to an enhanced pay rate nor to a day off , although many employers do give either or both. Any rights in this respect depend on the person's contract of employment. The statutory minimum holidays are currently 5.6 weeks a year (including any <b>bank</b> <b>holidays</b> or <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> that are taken).|$|R
50|$|These Regulations {{govern the}} time {{that people in the}} UK may work. The Regulations apply to all workers (not just employees) and {{stipulate}} minimum rest breaks, daily rest, weekly rest and the maximum average working week. First, it sets a default rule that workers may work no more than 48 hours per week (although one may opt out of it). Secondly, it grants a mandatory right to paid annual leave of at least a minimum of 28 days (including <b>bank</b> <b>holidays</b> and <b>public</b> <b>holidays).</b> Thirdly, it creates the right to a minimum period of rest of 20 minutes in any shift lasting over 6 hours.|$|R
50|$|Today {{the railway}} {{operates}} {{to a set}} timetable annually with trains running every Sunday between May and September, with the first train at 11:00 am and the final departure at 4:30 pm. Additional evening services operate between 7:00 pm and 9:00 pm on Wednesdays in July and August, and on Tuesdays in August only. One of the resident steam locomotives is in service wherever possible {{for each of the}} advertised operating days. When the line first re-opened services were also provided on <b>bank</b> <b>holidays</b> and <b>public</b> <b>holidays,</b> but this practice has been discontinued in more recent years. As part of the involvement with the Year of Railways in 1993 and subsequent anniversaries, the line has operated daily for periods of up to one week, the last being as part of Steam 125 in 1998 when visiting locomotives were in attendance. The railway's current standard timetable can be found at its website including details of special services.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> {{facilitate}} the co-ordination of leisure time {{but do not}} constrain the annual amount of leisure. <b>Public</b> <b>holidays</b> therefore have benefits both in the utility of leisure on holidays and (by enabling people to maintain social contacts more easily) in increasing the utility of leisure on normal weekdays and weekends. The paper uses the variation in <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> across German LÃ¤nder based on more than 37. 000 individual diary data of the actual German Time Use Survey of 2001 - 02 to illustrate the positive association between more <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> and social life on normal weekdays and weekends.

30|$|We {{discuss the}} impact of <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> {{modeling}} approaches used for electricity load forecasting. Therefore, we elaborate on the challenging properties of <b>public</b> <b>holidays,</b> especially of those which can be classified as fixed-date <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> or weekday <b>public</b> <b>holidays.</b>|$|R
3000|$|Furthermore, we {{have the}} hybrid {{approaches}} (HyAd 6 wh, HyAd 6 wH, [...]..., HyRp 7 wH) which consider the fixed-date <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> as Saturday or Sunday and the weekday <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> as holiday dummy. Overall they show a good forecasting performance. We observe that the forecasting accuracy for the fixed-date <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> is of the same magnitude as the corresponding holiday as weekday methods (hSat and hSun). So {{the improvement of the}} forecasting accuracy is mainly from the weekday <b>public</b> <b>holiday.</b> For weekday <b>public</b> <b>holidays,</b> the hybrid model show excellent performance with a similar error level as the best replacing holiday dummy methods.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} in detail special characteristics of <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> {{and how they}} influence regular weekly consumption pattern. We also discuss the impact of specific ways to account for <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> effects in different energy forecasting models and refer to the corresponding literature. Furthermore, we provide a large forecasting study for German electricity on 64 methodologies to deal with <b>public</b> <b>holidays,</b> {{as there is no}} such study in literature. Smaller studies of this kind can be found in [1, 5], but these studies are limited in size and show a lack of statistical validity. Additionally we address the question of the impact of univariate and multivariate modeling frameworks in the context of <b>holiday</b> <b>public</b> <b>holidays,</b> see [6]. The forecasting study gives substantial insight on the question how to deal with <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> in load forecasting which are also summarized in the final conclusion section.|$|R
5|$|May25 is a {{national}} day in Argentina, known as First Patriotic Government, with {{the character of a}} <b>public</b> <b>holiday.</b> The <b>public</b> <b>holiday</b> is set by law 21.329 and is always celebrated on May25, regardless of the day of the week. The Argentina Centennial and the Argentina Bicentennial were celebrated in 1910 and 2010.|$|R
30|$|A clear plus of this {{modeling}} {{approach is}} that captures automatically the different effects of fixed-date <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> and weekday <b>public</b> <b>holidays.</b> Another important feature is that all <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> get the same effect, similarly as selected weekday effects.|$|R

50|$|<b>Bank</b> and <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> in Scotland are {{determined}} under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971 and the St Andrew's Day <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> (Scotland) Act 2007. Unlike {{the rest of}} United Kingdom, most <b>bank</b> <b>holidays</b> are not recognised as statutory <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> in Scotland, as most <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> {{are determined}} by local authorities across Scotland. Some of these may be taken in lieu of statutory holidays, while others may be additional holidays, although many companies, including Royal Mail, do not follow all the holidays listed below; and many swap between English and local holidays. Many large shops and supermarkets continue to operate normally during <b>public</b> <b>holidays,</b> especially {{since there are no}} restrictions such as Sunday trading rules in Scotland.|$|R

5000|$|The {{two terms}} [...] "bank holidays" [...] and [...] "public holidays" [...] {{are often used}} interchangeably, {{although}} strictly and legally there is a difference. A government website describes the difference as follows: <b>Bank</b> <b>holidays</b> are <b>holidays</b> when <b>banks</b> and many other businesses are closed for the day. <b>Public</b> <b>holidays</b> are holidays which have been observed through custom and practice.|$|R
500|$|Officially, Japan has 16 national, government-recognized <b>holidays.</b> <b>Public</b> <b>holidays</b> in Japan are {{regulated}} under the <b>Public</b> <b>Holiday</b> Law (å½æ°ã®ç¥æ¥ã«é¢ããæ³å¾ Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru HÅritsu) of 1948. Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved {{a number of}} national holidays to Monday {{in order to obtain}} a long weekend. In 2006, the country decided to add ShÅwa Day, a new national holiday, in place of Greenery Day on April 29, and to move Greenery Day to May 4. These changes took effect in 2007. In 2014, the House of Councillors decided to add [...] to the Japanese calendar on August 11, after lobbying by the Japanese Alpine Club. It is intended to coincide with the Bon Festival vacation time, giving Japanese people an opportunity to appreciate Japan's mountains.|$|R
50|$|If a {{standard}} <b>public</b> <b>holiday</b> falls on a weekend, a substitute <b>public</b> <b>holiday</b> will sometimes be observed {{on the first}} non-weekend day (usually Monday) after the weekend, whether {{by virtue of the}} <b>public</b> <b>holiday</b> legislation or by ad hoc proclamation. If a worker is required to work on a <b>public</b> <b>holiday</b> or substituted <b>public</b> <b>holiday,</b> they will usually be entitled to be paid at a holiday penalty rate.|$|R
50|$|As is {{the case}} with all {{religious}} Jewish <b>holidays,</b> most <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> in Israel generally begin and end at sundown, and follow the Hebrew calendar. Because of this, most holidays in Israel fall on a different Gregorian calendar date each year, which syncs every 19 years with the Hebrew calendar.|$|R
50|$|A <b>public</b> <b>holiday,</b> {{national}} holiday or legal holiday is a holiday generally established by law {{and is usually}} a non-working day during the year.|$|R
50|$|Mother's Day {{is not an}} {{official}} <b>holiday</b> (see <b>Public</b> <b>holidays</b> in Brazil), but it is widely observed and typically involves spending time with and giving gifts to one's mother. Because of this, it {{is considered one of}} the celebrations most related to consumerism in the country, second only to Christmas Day as the most commercially lucrative holiday.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the National <b>Holidays,</b> there <b>Public</b> <b>Holidays</b> that are not celebrated nationwide, but only by a specific professional group or a local community. For example, many municipalities have a [...] "Patron Saint", also called [...] "Name Day", or a [...] "Liberation Day", and at this day is customary for schools to have a day off.|$|R
30|$|We {{have seen}} the {{additional}} <b>public</b> <b>holiday</b> approach where <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> are added and the replacing one where <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> are added but the corresponding weekday dummies is replaced by 0. The replacing method was mainly introduced by the problem that additional approach double counts fixed-date <b>public</b> <b>holiday</b> on weekends (esp. Sunday). However, this is only an issue for fixed-date <b>public</b> <b>holidays</b> but not for weekday holidays. So {{there is also the}} option of considering the replacing approach for the weekday <b>public</b> <b>holidays,</b> but keeping the (simple) additional holiday approach.|$|R
