5|$|Although Shankar {{initially}} {{claimed that}} Enthiran would <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> all audiences, including those lacking computer literacy, {{the film is}} influenced by and makes references to many scientific principles relating to the fields of engineering, computer science and robotics, including terabytes and Asimov's laws of robotics. Visual references are made to the science books A Briefer History of Time (2005) and Freakonomics (2005). In his book Visual Perception and Cultural Memory: Typecast and Typecast(e)ing in Malayalam Cinema, Sujith Kumar Parayil notes the similarities between Kalabhavan Mani's role in the film to the one Mani played in the Malayalam film Sallapam (1996).|$|E
5|$|Any dive {{which is}} started while the tissues retain {{residual}} inert gas {{in excess of}} the surface equilibrium condition is considered a repetitive dive. This means that the decompression required for the dive is influenced by the divers decompression history. Allowance must <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> inert gas preloading of the tissues which will result in them containing more dissolved gas than would have been the case if the diver had fully equilibrated before the dive. The diver will need to decompress longer to eliminate this increased gas loading.|$|E
5|$|Betances died at 10:00a.m., local time, in Neuilly-sur-Seine on Friday, September 16, 1898. His {{remains were}} cremated soon after and entombed at the Père Lachaise Cemetery of Paris on Monday, September 19. He had {{requested}} that no formal ceremony <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> his funeral. His common law-wife Simplicia survived him for over 20 years. A {{look at his}} will implies that, besides a life insurance policy payout and two parcels {{of land in the}} Dominican Republic, Betances died almost in poverty.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} development, {{multiple}} {{members of}} staff voiced dissatisfaction with the final product. Ito and Suzuki felt that the portrayals of the Law and Chaos Heroes were imbalanced, with the Chaos Hero being too emotional and the Law Hero being unsympathetic. They also saw the demon fusion system as too difficult for players to master. Okada, while commenting on what improvements would <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the next game, stated that {{there were too many}} useless items in the game. Niino felt that the game's pacing and flow needed to be addressed, as after naming the characters, the player immediately is prompted to divide their status points.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{can form}} very long chains of {{interconnecting}} carbon–carbon bonds, a property {{that is called}} catenation. Carbon-carbon bonds are strong and stable. Through catenation, carbon forms a countless number of compounds. A tally of unique compounds shows that more contain carbon that those that do not. A similar claim can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> hydrogen because most organic compounds also contain hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Condor bones {{have been}} found in Native American graves, as have condor feather headdresses. Cave {{paintings}} of condors have also been discovered. Some tribes ritually killed condors to make ceremonial clothing out of their feathers. Shamans then danced while wearing these to reach the upper and lower spiritual worlds. Whenever a shaman died, his clothes were said to be cursed, so new clothing had to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> his successor. Some scientists, such as Noel Snyder, believe that this process of making ceremonial clothing contributed to the condor's decline.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the project}} had neither a budget nor a script. On the former issue, Universal head Lew Wasserman thought the film could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> $12 million; the filmmakers wanted $20 million. It would be {{impossible}} to settle on a specific amount without a screenplay to review, and after Mitch Glazer declined to help him, Aykroyd wrote one on his own.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard four difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert) for each song and instrument, a new Beginner level has been added in World Tour. This difficulty is aimed for younger and unskilled players; notes are generally simple straight lines in time with bass drum beats, and allowing any or no fret button to be held while the note is strummed (for lead and bass guitar), any drum to be hit (for drums), or any sound to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> (<b>for</b> vocals).|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} season with the Hawks, Abdur-Rahim {{achieved}} another personal milestone on December 28, 2002, when his jump shot against the Washington Wizards made him the sixth-youngest player in NBA history to reach 10,000-points. Although Glenn Robinson, Jason Terry and Abdur-Rahim combined to average 57.9 ppg and become the highest-scoring trio in the league for the 2002–03 season, the Hawks {{failed to make the}} playoffs again. With an average of 19.9 ppg and 8.4 rpg, Abdur-Rahim played in {{all but one of the}} Hawks' games. By the end of the season, Hawks General Manager Billy Knight decided major changes had to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the franchise to move forward, and Abdur-Rahim was traded the next season.|$|E

5|$|Military squads can be {{assigned}} to a barracks to train in and a uniform (armor and a weapon) can be chosen. Squads can be directly commanded to attack enemies. Crossbows can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> ranged attacks and a range with targets can be constructed for training. Walls can be carved into fortifications and be used by ranged-units during attacks. Training areas {{can be made to}} train war animals like dogs. Players can use traps and engineering in addition to training an army. Traps can be made by constructing mechanisms and using metal or wood to construct large weapons like spikes, ax blades or cages. More complex lever-operated and pressure plate-triggering trap components are available.|$|E
5|$|Minneapolis's Oak Street Cinema, a volunteer-run {{repertory}} cinema, ran films {{seven days}} per week until cutbacks in programming had to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> financial reasons. A collective of the Oak Street volunteers formed Take-Up Productions, which was established to promote showing films not typically screened in larger movie houses. The organization began with outdoor screenings, starting with Watermelon Man, which was projected against a white brick wall behind a coffee shop, {{and then began to}} rent out theaters throughout the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area, including the Riverview, Heights, and Parkway. Some screenings, such as that of Lawrence of Arabia and a series of Alfred Hitchcock films, drew hundreds of viewers.|$|E
5|$|Myst was {{originally}} conceptualized by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller. The Millers had created fictional worlds and stories as young children, {{influenced by the}} works of authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert A. Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov. They formed a video game company together called Cyan, Inc.; their first game, called The Manhole, won the Software Publishers Association award in 1988 for best use of the digital medium. Cyan produced other games, aimed at children; the Millers eventually decided their next project would <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> adults.|$|E

5|$|The Loboc Church is {{currently}} in the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Sites under the Baroque Churches of the Philippines (Extension).
