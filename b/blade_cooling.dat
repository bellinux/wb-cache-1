50|$|At a {{constant}} pressure ratio, thermal efficiency increases as the maximum temperature increases. But, high temperatures {{can damage the}} turbine, as the blades are under large centrifugal stresses and materials are weaker at high temperature. So, turbine <b>blade</b> <b>cooling</b> is essential.|$|E
50|$|Allowable turbine entry {{temperatures}} {{have increased}} steadily over time {{both with the}} introduction of superior alloys and coatings, and with the introduction and progressive effectiveness of <b>blade</b> <b>cooling</b> designs. On early engines, the turbine temperature limit had to be monitored, and avoided, by the pilot, typically during starting and at maximum thrust settings. Automatic temperature limiting was introduced to reduce pilot workload and reduce the liklehood of turbine damage due to overtemperature.|$|E
50|$|Compared to an {{axial flow}} turbine, a radial turbine can employ a {{relatively}} higher pressure ratio (≈4) per stage with lower flow rates. Thus these machines {{fall in the}} lower specific speed and power ranges. For high temperature applications rotor <b>blade</b> <b>cooling</b> in radial stages is {{not as easy as}} in axial turbine stages. Variable angle nozzle blades can give higher stage efficiencies in a radial turbine stage even at off-design point operation. In the family of hydro-turbines, Francis turbine is a very well-known IFR turbine which generates much larger power with a relatively large impeller.|$|E

50|$|The engine had {{variable}} {{inlet guide}} vanes, as used on many other engines, necessary for accelerating from idle to high thrust. However, on the Gyron Junior, {{positioning of the}} vanes was not reliable and could cause surging which, in turn, could prevent accelerating to higher thrust levels. A possibly unique feature on this engine was valve-controlled cooling air to the turbine blades. The engine had to supply air for the aircraft's boundary layer control system and the resulting thrust loss was unacceptable. To regain the thrust the turbine temperature limit was raised by using turbine <b>blade</b> <b>cooling,</b> selected only with blowing on.|$|E

50|$|Cooling is {{required}} to remove excessive heat — over heating can cause engine failure, usually from wear (due to heat-induced failure of lubrication), cracking or warping. Two most common forms of engine cooling are air-cooled and water-cooled. Most modern automotive engines are both water and air-cooled, as the water/liquid-coolant is carried to air-cooled fins and/or fans, whereas larger engines may be singularly water-cooled as they are stationary and have a constant supply of water through water-mains or fresh-water, while most power tool engines and other small engines are air-cooled. Some engines (air or water-cooled) also have an oil cooler. In some engines, especially for turbine engine <b>blade</b> <b>cooling</b> and liquid rocket engine cooling, fuel {{is used as a}} coolant, as it is simultaneously preheated before injecting it into a combustion chamber.|$|E

40|$|The turbine <b>blade</b> <b>cooling</b> {{has been}} {{considered}} to be a unique solution to increase the efficiency of the gas turbine engine. There are many difference methods for turbine <b>blade</b> <b>cooling</b> which have received serious attention and research effort. Most of them use basically the same method that passes the amount of cooling air through the turbine blade. These methods can disturb the hot gas since the cooling air is injected into the main stream gas, which may reduce the turbine engine 2 ̆ 7 s efficiency. A new turbine cooling method is studied in this thesis. This method employs the cooling air that passes through the root and neck, and along with it uses the composite materials or heat pipes for the airfoil and root. The heat will be conducted from the airfoil to the root and will be carried away by the cooling air. The analytical investigations for the heat transfer in the turbine blade with various thermal conductivity and mass flow rates are made and closed-form solutions for the temperature distributions and heat transfer rates are obtained. The software FLUENT/UNS is used to investigate the effects of thermal and flow conditions on the turbine <b>blade</b> <b>cooling.</b> The comparison between the analytical results and the numerical results from FLUENT/UNS is made and recommendations for the future study are purposed in this thesis...|$|E
50|$|Wet or dry cutting. Though {{diamond saw}} blades for {{concrete}} are usually laser welded, they are normally designed for wet cutting because the concrete {{to be cut}} is often very hard or abrasive. If the blades are used without adequate water, the diamond segment itself may break or the steel core below the segment may wear and break, and then the segment may fly out and may hurt the operator or people nearby. If you have to perform dry cutting for some reason (e.g. there is no water source near your work area), you can choose sharper diamond blades, and the dry cutting should be intermittent and shallow (you can do several passes of shallow cuttings to gain a deep cut) to keep the diamond <b>blade</b> <b>cool.</b>|$|R

As soon as specifications were drawn up for certain items, the design group would place orders for them. Some facilities had to be fabricated for the purpose.

In order maximize the overall performance and efficiency of all modern turbines, which theoretically operate according to Brayton cycle, they are operated at a very high temperature. These temperatures are so high that, which may fall in the region of turbine blade material melting point temperatures. Due to such high temperatures there is a possibility that the turbine blades may get damaged due to produced thermal stresses and presents a possible threat to the turbine system as well as the operators. Hence to ensure safe and reliable working of the turbines an effective and reliable cooling system is necessary. Currently available methods for cooling of the turbine <b>blades</b> include film <b>cooling</b> with impingement cooling for the leading edge, rib turbulated cooling using serpentine passages for the middle portion of the blade and pin fin cooling for the trailing edge of the turbine <b>blades.</b> The <b>cooling</b> mechanism for turbine <b>blades</b> must include <b>cooling</b> for all possible regions which are exposed to hot gas flow.

Modern, high-pressure turbine blades are made from Ni-based superalloys in single-crystal form via the investment casting process. One important post-cast surface defect, known as 'surface scale', has been investigated on the alloy CMSX- 10 N. This is an area of distinct discolouration of the aerofoil seen after casting. Auger electron and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis were carried out on both scaled and un-scaled areas. In the scaled region, a thin layer (~ 800 nm) of Ni oxide is evident.
