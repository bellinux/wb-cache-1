40|$|We herein {{report the}} {{pulmonary}} histopathological findings of an autopsy case of postpandemic season A/H 1 N 1 pdm 09 infection-associated {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome (ARDS). The lung histology predominantly exhibited findings indicative of the exudative phase of diffuse alveolar damage, with similar inflammation severity observed in all sections. Furthermore, the lung sections only showed a few A/H 1 N 1 pdm 09 antigen-positive cells along with a low viral RNA copy number.

40|$|Background: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is {{an acute}} {{deterioration}} of established liver disease. Blocking the TNF (tumor necrosis factor) /TNFR (tumor necrosis factor receptor) 1 pathway may reduce hepatocyte apoptosis/necrosis, and subsequently decrease mortality during development of ACLF.

However, {{it is still}} unclear if sTNFR:IgG-Fc can inhibit hepatocyte damage during development of ACLF. Methodology: Chronic liver disease (liver fibrosis/cirrhosis) was induced in Wistar rats by repeatedly challenging with human serum albumin (HSA), and confirmed by histopathology.
