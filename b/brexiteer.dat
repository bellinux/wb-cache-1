50|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 11 June, Theresa May finalised the composition of her cabinet. The senior positions of Chancellor, Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary, {{as well as the}} Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, had already been confirmed on 9 June with all four incumbents staying in office. The reshuffle saw prominent <b>Brexiteer</b> MPs, such as Boris Johnson and David Davis, retain their roles, but also resulted in the promotion of Damian Green and David Gauke, politicians who had supported the remain side during the EU referendum. Junior ministerial roles were allocated the following day, with a full list of new ministerial and government appointments confirmed on 12 June.|$|E
50|$|Harris has {{appeared}} in numerous stage productions, including A Streetcar Named Desire at London’s Pack and Carriage and Measure For Measure at Oxford’s North Wall, which received favourable reviews. In November 2016, she appeared {{in the role of}} Beth Armstrong for the BBC Radio 4 play Michael and Boris: The Two <b>Brexiteers.</b>|$|R
40|$|On September 22, Theresa May's {{speech in}} Florence ostensibly {{outlined}} {{a way forward}} on Brexit. Is the £ 20 bn on offer too much, too little or too late? Are promises {{to protect the rights}} of EU citizens in the UK real or merely rhetorical? What will happen next - renewed dialogue with Brussels or a bust-up with Boris and other <b>Brexiteers?</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Was British {{business}} {{destined to}} leave the EU? While corporate UK was strongly opposed to Brexit, their strategies tell a slightly different story, write Michael Mayer, Julia Hautz, Christian Stadler and Richard Whittington. Always good {{to start with a}} confession: we are what <b>Brexiteers</b> call Remoaners. As Michael Bloomberg says, "it is really hard to understand why a country that was doing [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Ominous {{clouds are}} {{gathering}} and the terrain underfoot increasingly resembles a quagmire on the <b>Brexiteers</b> ‘sunlit uplands’. It is therefore unsurprising that the chatter about revoking the Art. 50 notification {{to withdraw from}} the EU – itself waxing and waning since the referendum vote – has become louder in recent days; spurred on by a freedom of information request seeking the government’s legal advice on the question...|$|R
40|$|As the Brexit {{negotiations}} labour on, {{the complexity}} of what lies ahead is finally, painfully, becoming clear to the UK government. Some <b>Brexiteers,</b> including Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, now seem to accept the idea that, although the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, {{some sort of a}} transitional phase will be necessar...|$|R
40|$|More {{than ten}} weeks ago now, the UK voted {{to leave the}} European Union. Holger Schmieding {{explains}} why the initial shock has subsided fast. First, instead of taking charge, the leading <b>Brexiteers</b> lost the ensuing power struggle within the Conservative party as the mildly pro-EU Theresa May prevailed within just three weeks. Second, May’s calm and slow approach to Brexit issues has fostered the impression that she will seek realistic co-operation rather than ideological confrontation with the EU 27...|$|R
5000|$|In November 2016, BBC Radio 4 {{broadcast}} Michael & Boris: The Two <b>Brexiteers.</b> [...] The drama reconstructed how Boris Johnson and Michael Gove {{fell out}} after their Brexit victory. It revealed {{for the first}} time why Boris Johnson failed to persuade Andrea Leadsom to join his campaign for the leadership of the Conservative Party. The cast included Alistair McGowan as Boris Johnson, Luke Kempner as Michael Gove, Liza Sadovy as Sarah Vine, and Philip Franks as Ben Wallace MP.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} of a series of pieces for LSE Brexit setting out the scale of the {{challenge}} ahead as Britain considers how to trade post-Brexit, Michael Johnson explains what Britain’s membership of the World Trade Organisation means for tariffs and market access for services, and why – despite criticism from some hardline <b>Brexiteers</b> – Liam Fox has said that the UK intends to stick as far as possible to the rates which it currently applies under the EU’s WTO tariff schedules...|$|R
40|$|Throughout the West, patriotism {{is on the}} rise, writes Victoria Bateman. During the EU referendum, {{the issue}} of {{sovereignty}} was high up the agenda. An outpouring of patriotism came {{along for the ride}} – a patriotism that Theresa May has since found herself defending on behalf of <b>Brexiteers.</b> But just how much of a threat is patriotism to the economy? Is it truly dangerous, or does it have a hidden economic value? She argues that it can indeed be useful, provided a country is sufficiently outward-looking and the rules of trade are observed...|$|R
40|$|The United Kingdom {{intends to}} leave the single market, yet still wants to retain broad access to it {{by means of a}} {{comprehensive}} free trade agreement. But the question remains as to whether the European Union is prepared to play ball. <b>Brexiteers</b> claim that German companies in particular, worried about their exports to the UK, will push for a gentle compromise in the favour of the UK, so that trade can continue with as little disruption as possible. Yet a survey by the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW K 6 ln) has cast doubt on this view...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} {{political}} movements {{that appear to}} be immune to any factual evidence that contradicts their claims – from the <b>Brexiteers</b> to the 'alt‐right', neo‐fascist groups supporting Donald Trump – has reinvigorated claims that social media spaces constitute so‐called 'filter bubbles' or 'echo chambers'. But while such claims may appear intuitively true to politicians and journalists – who have themselves been accused of living in filter bubbles (Bradshaw 2016) –, the evidence that ordinary users experience their everyday social media environments as echo chambers is far more limited. For instance, a 2016 Pew Center study has shown that only 23...|$|R
5000|$|Sean O'Grady of The Independent {{felt the}} series based on Wakefield's books [...] "are better adapted {{than most other}} {{exercises}} of this nature. Bottersnikes are superbly rendered lizardly creatures that are the bogeymen of the show, a bit like Momentum in the Labour Party; Gumbles are apparently normal, but hopelessly optimistic, like <b>Brexiteers.</b> The stories are short and sweet and the attention to detail is remarkable." [...] The show received a Pulcinella Award for 'Best Kids TV Series' at the international animation festival, Cartoons on the Bay, in Venice and was nominated for 'Most Outstanding Children’s program' at the 2016 Logie Awards.|$|R

Despite this, {{he does not believe}} that Conservative <b>Brexiteers</b> such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson are truly opposed to membership of the European Union, and did not vote to leave in the Brexit referendum {{as a result of this}} disillusionment. He has also claimed that [...] "I think referenda are fundamentally unconstitutional, and I don't think we should have them" [...] and was not [...] "particularly pleased" [...] with the outcome of the EU referendum. He has also described Brexit as a [...] "constitutional crisis" [...] due to the pro-EU makeup of Parliament, and has stated that he believes it would take 10 years for Britain to fully leave the European Union.|$|R
40|$|On June 23, 2016, on a turnout of 72. 2 % {{of those}} {{eligible}} to vote, a small majority (51. 9 % vs 48. 1 %) in UK’s EU referendum voted {{to leave the}} EU. UK people will now no longer be citizens of the EU but tourists and visitors to it. However it was an accidental exit. The referendum was called by UK Prime Minister David Cameron to appease his own party’s rebellious backbench MPs. But Brexit was not the intended outcome. Cameron only triggered the referendum because he thought the Government would win it. Neither the Remain nor Leave camps seriously thought that the UK would vote anything other than Remain. Neither camp had any plans for anything else. For the Government there was no Plan B and for <b>Brexiteers</b> there was no Plan A...|$|R

5000|$|May's {{handling}} of the campaign was widely criticised, particularly the role of her two chiefs of staff, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill. On 11 June 2017, former Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, described May as a [...] "dead woman walking". A survey on the website Conservative Home found that almost two thirds of Conservative party members want Theresa May to resign.A YouGov poll of 1,720 adults for the Sunday Times had 48% saying Theresa May should resign, with 38% against. A Survation poll of 1,036 adults online for the Mail on Sunday had 49% of people wanting her resignation, with 38% against. Former Cabinet minister Anna Soubry called for May to [...] "consider her position" [...] after the election result. Former Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan said that May could not lead the Conservative Party into the next general election {{and called for a}} leadership election in the summer or in 2018 before the Brexit deal is finalised. <b>Brexiteers</b> pledged loyalty to May but many reportedly threatened an immediate leadership challenge should May plan to dilute her initial plans for Brexit. After the Grenfell Tower fire, May's leadership faced more criticism after her initial refusal to meet victims and her {{handling of}} the crisis.|$|R
