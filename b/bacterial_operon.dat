30|$|Operons are multigene {{transcriptional}} units which occur {{primarily in}} prokaryotes {{but also in}} some eukaryotes (Blumenthal 2004; Jacob et al. 2005). A typical <b>bacterial</b> <b>operon</b> was defined as several structural genes arranged in tandem that are transcribed in a single polycistronic mRNA {{under the control of}} the same promoter (Jacob et al. 2005). However, naturally occurring genetic regulatory elements hardly meet the requirements for biotechnological applications. Progress in the development of artificial hybrid operons promises to greatly broaden the use of E. coli as a model for the production of heterologous proteins (Yadav et al. 2014).|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that 6 S RNA, a global {{regulatory}} noncoding RNA that modulates gene expression in response to the cellular stresses in Escherichia coli, is generated by processing from primary ssrS (6 S RNA) transcripts derived from two different promoters. The 5 ′ processing of 6 S RNA from primary transcripts has been well studied; however, it remains unclear how the 3 ′-end of this RNA is generated although previous studies have suggested that exoribonucleolytic trimming is necessary for 3 ′ processing. Here, we describe several Rho-dependent termination sites located ∼ 90 bases downstream of the mature 3 ′-end of 6 S RNA. Our data suggest that the 3 ′-end of 6 S RNA is generated via exoribonucleolytic trimming, rather than endoribonucleolytic cleavage, following the transcription termination events. The termination sites identified in this study are within the open reading frame of the downstream ygfA (putative 5 -formyl-tetrahydrofolate cyclo-ligase) gene, a part of the highly conserved <b>bacterial</b> <b>operon</b> ssrS-ygfA, which is up-regulated during the biofilm formation. Our findings reveal that ygfA expression, which also aids the formation of multidrug-tolerant persister cells, could be regulated by Rho-dependent termination activity in the cell...|$|E
40|$|As {{interest}} in the therapeutic and biotechnological potentials of bacteriophages has grown, so has value in understanding their basic biology. However, detailed knowledge of infection cycles has been limited to {{a small number of}} model bacteriophages, mostly infecting Escherichia coli. We present here the first analysis coupling data obtained from global next-generation approaches, RNA-Sequencing and metabolomics, to characterize interactions between the virulent bacteriophage PAK_P 3 and its host Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We detected a dramatic global depletion of bacterial transcripts coupled with their replacement by viral RNAs over the course of infection, eventually leading to drastic changes in pyrimidine metabolism. This process relies on host machinery hijacking as suggested by the strong up-regulation of one <b>bacterial</b> <b>operon</b> involved in RNA processing. Moreover, we found that RNA-based regulation plays a central role in PAK_P 3 lifecycle as antisense transcripts are produced mainly during the early stage of infection and viral small non coding RNAs are massively expressed at the end of infection. This work highlights the prominent role of RNA metabolism in the infection strategy of a bacteriophage belonging to a new characterized sub-family of viruses with promising therapeutic potential. status: publishe...|$|E

50|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>operons</b> are {{polycistronic}} transcripts {{that are}} able to produce multiple proteins from one mRNA transcript. In this case, when lactose is required as a sugar source for the bacterium, the three genes of the lac operon can be expressed and their subsequent proteins translated: lacZ, lacY, and lacA. The gene product of lacZ is β-galactosidase which cleaves lactose, a disaccharide, into glucose and galactose. lacY encodes Beta-galactoside permease, a protein which becomes embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane to enable transport of lactose into the cell. Finally, lacA encodes β-galactoside transacetylase.|$|R
50|$|Attenuation (in genetics) is a {{proposed}} mechanism {{of control in}} some <b>bacterial</b> <b>operons</b> which results in premature termination of transcription {{and is based on}} the fact that, in bacteria, transcription and translation proceed simultaneously. Attenuation involves a provisional stop signal (attenuator), located in the DNA segment that corresponds to the leader sequence of mRNA. During attenuation, the ribosome becomes stalled (delayed) in the attenuator region in the mRNA leader. Depending on the metabolic conditions, the attenuator either stops transcription at that point or allows read-through to the structural gene part of the mRNA and synthesis of the appropriate protein.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a system called the Operon Assembly Protocol (OAP), which {{takes advantage of the}} homologous recombination DNA repair pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to assemble full-length operons from a series of overlapping PCR products into a specially engineered yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vector. This flexible, streamlined system can be used to assemble several operon clones simultaneously, and each clone can be expressed in the same E. coli tester strain to facilitate direct functional comparisons. We demonstrated the utility of the OAP by assembling and expressing a series of E. coli O 1 A O-antigen gene cluster clones containing various gene deletions or replacements. We then used these constructs to assess the substrate preferences of several Wzx flippases, which are responsible for translocation of oligosaccharide repeat units (O units) across the inner membrane during O-antigen biosynthesis. We were able to identify several O unit structural features that appear to be important determinants of Wzx substrate preference. The OAP system should be broadly applicable for the genetic manipulation of any <b>bacterial</b> <b>operon</b> and can be modified for use in other host species. It could also have potential uses in fields such as glycoengineering...|$|E
40|$|Tubulins {{are still}} {{considered}} as typical proteins of Eukaryotes. However, more recently {{they have been}} found in the unusual bacteria Prosthecobacter (btubAB). In this study, the genomic organization of the btub-genes and their genomic environment were characterized by using the newly developed Two-Step Gene Walking method. In all investigated Prosthecobacters, btubAB are organized in a typical <b>bacterial</b> <b>operon.</b> Strikingly, all btub-operons comprise a third gene with similarities to kinesin light chain sequences. The genomic environments of the characterized btub-operons are always different. This supports the hypothesis that this group of genes represents an independent functional unit, which was acquired by Prosthecobacter via horizontal gene transfer. The newly developed Two-Step Gene Walking method is based on randomly primed polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It presents a simple workflow, which comprises only two major steps—a Walking-PCR with a single specific outward pointing primer (step 1) and the direct sequencing of its product using a nested specific primer (step 2). Two-Step Gene Walking proved to be highly efficient and was successfully used to characterize over 20 kb of sequence not only in pure culture but even in complex non-pure culture samples...|$|E
40|$|The {{anaerobic}} protozoan Giardia lamblia is {{a common}} intestinal parasite in humans, but is poorly defined at molecular and phylogenetic levels. We report here a structural characterization of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and rRNA genes of G. lamblia. Gel electrophoresis under native or non-denaturing conditions identified two high molecular weight rRNA species corresponding to the 16 - 18 S and 23 - 28 S rRNAs. Surprisingly, both species (1300 and 2300 nucleotides long, respectively) were considerably shorter than their counterparts from other protozoa (typically 1800 and 3400 nucleotides), and from bacteria as well (typically 1540 and 2900 nucleotides long). Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis identified a major low molecular RNA of 127 nucleotides and several minor species, but no molecules with the typical lengths of 5. 8 S (160 nucleotides) and 5 S (120 nucleotides) rRNA. The G. lamblia 1300, 2300, and 127 nucleotide RNAs are encoded within a 5. 6 kilobase pair tandemly repeated DNA, as shown by Southern blot analysis and DNA cloning. Thus, the rRNA operon of this eukaryotic organism can be no longer than a typical <b>bacterial</b> <b>operon.</b> Sequence analysis identified the 127 nucleotide RNA as homologous to 5. 8 S RNA, but comparisons to archaebacterial rRNA suggest that Giardia derived from an early branch in eukaryotic evolution...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThiamin and {{riboflavin}} are precursors {{of essential}} coenzymes—thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) /flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), respectively. In Bacillus spp, genes responsible for thiamin and riboflavin biosynthesis are organized in tightly controllable operons. Here, we {{demonstrate that the}} feedback regulation of riboflavin and thiamin genes relies on a novel transcription attenuation mechanism. A unique feature of this mechanism is the formation of specific complexes between a conserved leader region of the cognate RNA and FMN or TPP. In each case, the complex allows the termination hairpin to form and interrupt transcription prematurely. Thus, sensing small molecules by nascent RNA controls transcription elongation of riboflavin and thiamin operons and possibly other <b>bacterial</b> <b>operons</b> as well...|$|R

40|$|Multigene {{expression}} {{is required for}} metabolic engineering, i. e. coregulated expression of all genes in a metabolic pathway {{for the production of}} a desired secondary metabolite. To that end, several transgenic approaches have been attempted with limited success. Better success has been achieved by transforming plastids with operons. IL- 60 is a platform of constructs driven from the geminivirus Tomato yellow leaf curl virus. We demonstrate that IL- 60 enables nontransgenic expression of an entire <b>bacterial</b> <b>operon</b> in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants without the need for plastid (or any other) transformation. Delivery to the plant is simple, and the rate of expressing plants is close to 100 %, eliminating the need for selectable markers. Using this platform, we show the expression of an entire metabolic pathway in plants and delivery of the end product secondary metabolite (pyrrolnitrin). Expression of this unique secondary metabolite resulted in the appearance of a unique plant phenotype disease resistance. Pyrrolnitrin production was already evident 2 d after application of the operon to plants and persisted throughout the plant's life span. Expression of entire metabolic pathways in plants is potentially beneficial for plant improvement, disease resistance, and biotechnological advances, such as commercial production of desired metabolites...|$|E
40|$|The high {{affinity}} binding {{interaction of}} biotin to avidin or streptavidin {{has been used}} widely in biochemistry and molecular biology, often in sensitive protein detection or protein capture applications. However, in vitro chemical techniques for protein biotinylation are not always successful, with some common problems being a lack of reaction specificity, inactivation of amino acid residues critical for protein function {{and low levels of}} biotin incorporation. This report describes an improved expression system for the highly specific and quantitative in vivo biotinylation of fusion proteins. A short ‘biotinylation peptide’, described previously by Schatz, is linked to the N-terminus of Escherichia coli thioredoxin (TrxA) to form a new protein, called BIOTRX. The ‘biotinylation peptide ’ serves as an in vivo substrate mimic for E. coli biotin holoenzyme synthetase (BirA), an enzyme which usually performs highly selective biotinylation of E. coli biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP). A plasmid expression vector carrying the BIOTRX and birA genes arranged as a <b>bacterial</b> <b>operon</b> can be used to obtain high level production of soluble BIOTRX and BirA proteins and, under appropriate culture conditions, BIOTRX protein produced by this system is completely biotinylated. Fusions of BIOTRX to other proteins or peptides, whether these poly-peptides are linked to the C-terminus or inserted into the BIOTRX active site loop, are also quantitatively biotinylated. Both types of BIOTRX fusion can be captured efficiently on avidin/streptavidin media for purification purposes or to facilitate interaction assays. We illustrate the utility of the system by measurements of antibody and soluble receptor protein binding to BIOTRX fusions immobilized on streptavidin-conjugated BIAcore chips...|$|E
40|$|Heavy metals {{from natural}} and {{man-made}} sources {{can be a}} great threat to human and animal life. As small inorganic ions they are challenging to detect, usually requiring expensive and complicated machinery. Several heavy metals can accumulate in the human body, leading to long term toxic effects on the nervous system. Many bacteria have developed strategies to survive in heavy metal rich environments. One of these strategies is a <b>bacterial</b> <b>operon</b> containing genes for detoxification mechanisms controlled by a promoter and a regulatory protein. In this work some of these promoter-protein pairs, Pars-ArsR, PcopA-CueR, PmerTPAD-MerR and PzntA-ZntR from Escherichia coli have been employed in the design and construction of a set of biosensors aimed at the detection of heavy metals in drinking water. Biosensors usually employ biological recognition elements, transducing the signal from these to produce an output that can be integrated into electronic circuitry. The sensors presented in this work focus on reducing complexity and on providing a controlled sensor reaction. The arsenic biosensor ‘AsGard’ is based on the Pars-ArsR pair and functions by making the dissociation of an ArsR-mCherry fusion protein from its binding site in the Pars promoter visible. In the cell, ArsR dissociates from Pars upon binding of trivalent arsenic ions. Immobilising the relevant part of the Pars sequence on a solid plastic support allows for the mobilisation of previously bound ArsR-mCherry proteins in the presence of arsenic to become the sensor output. The AsGard sensor detects arsenic within minutes in a concentration range overlapping with the arsenic thresholds for drinking water as set by the World Health Organisation. Additional prototype sensors are presented bringing a reporter gene {{under the control of the}} aforementioned promoters. These sensors have been tested in vivo and in vitro in a cell free transcription translation system and partially detect metal concentrations close to relevant ranges. The Pars based sensor is tuneable in vitro by modifying the ratio of the supplied regulatory protein ArsR and is able to detect arsenic well within the relevant range. Spinach 2, a fluorescent RNA aptamer, may make future designs independent from translation, drastically reducing complexity of cell free biosensors based on cis-trans transcriptional regulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{induction}} of λ prophage provokes the constitutive {{expression of}} the adjacent gal operon in E. coli.

N-mediated transcription not only fails to terminate at the prophage-bacterial junction and at the ends of <b>bacterial</b> <b>operons,</b> but ignores termination signals caused by polar insertions or ochre mutations within gal. Suppression of polarity by N-function is a cis-effect; only transcription initiated at the phage promoter is influenced.

These analyses include determining the location of the gene coding for the delta subunit of the F 1 portion of the complex. We call this gene uncH.

40|$|Operons {{are found}} across {{multiple}} kingdoms and phyla, from prokaryotes to chordates. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the genome contains > 1000 operons that compose ∼ 15 % of the protein-coding genes. However, {{determination of the}} force(s) promoting the origin and maintenance of operons in C. elegans has proved elusive. Compared to <b>bacterial</b> <b>operons,</b> genes within a C. elegans operon often show poor coexpression and only sometimes encode proteins with related functions. Using analysis of microarray and large-scale in situ hybridization data, we demonstrate that almost all operon-encoded genes are expressed in germline tissue. However, genes expressed during spermatogenesis are excluded from operons. Operons group together along chromosomes in local clusters that also contain monocistronic germline-expressed genes. Additionally, germline expression of genes in operons is largely independent of the molecular function of the encoded proteins. These analyses demonstrate that mechanisms governing germline gene expression influence operon origination and/or maintenance. Thus, gene expression in a specific tissue can have profound effects {{on the evolution of}} genome organization...|$|R

40|$|Conditional cooperativity is {{a common}} {{mechanism}} involved in transcriptional regulation of prokaryotic type II toxin-antitoxin operons and is intricately related to bacterial persistence. It allows the toxin component of a toxin-antitoxin module {{to act as a}} co-repressor at low doses of toxin as compared to antitoxin. When toxin level exceeds a certain threshold, however, the toxin becomes a de-repressor. Most antitoxins contain an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) that typically is involved in toxin neutralization and repressor complex formation. To address how the antitoxin IDR is involved in transcription regulation, we studied the phd-doc operon from bacteriophage P 1. We provide evidence that the IDR of Phd provides an entropic barrier precluding full operon repression in the absence of Doc. Binding of Doc results in a cooperativity switch and consequent strong operon repression, enabling context-specific modulation of the regulatory process. Variations of this theme are likely to be a common mechanism in the autoregulation of <b>bacterial</b> <b>operons</b> that involve intrinsically disordered regions.

40|$|Experiments {{reported}} {{over the}} past several years, including genome-wide microarray approaches, have demonstrated that many eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) associate with multiple messenger RNAs (mRNAs) both in vitro and in vivo. This multitargeted binding property of RBPs has led to a model of regulated gene expression in eukaryotes that we termed the post-transcriptional operon. This concept was established by an analogy between polycistronic mRNAs that are generated from <b>bacterial</b> <b>operons,</b> and the co-ordinated regulation of multiple monocistronic mRNAs by RBPs. Post-transcriptional operons represent a powerful mechanism to organize and express genetic information as functionally related combinations of monocistronic mRNAs. In fact, much of the diversification of individual proteomes may be determined by the combinatorial properties of post-transcriptional operons. This review examines data supporting the role of post-transcriptional operons and regulons in organizing genetic information and co-ordinating expression of functionally related transcripts from their origins at transcription to their subsequent splicing, export and translation. The proteome is determined ultimately at the post-transcriptional leve...|$|R

When we expressed a hybrid F 1 Fo (F 1 from thermophilic Bacillus PS 3 and Na+-translocating Fo from Propionigenium modestum) in Escherchia coli cells, {{we found that}} uncI derived from P. modestum was indispensable to produce active enzyme; without uncI, c-subunits in F 1 Fo existed as monomers but not as functional c 11 -ring. When uncI was expressed from another plasmid at the same time, active F 1 Fo with c 11 -ring was produced. A plasmid containing only uncI and c-subunit gene produced c 11 -ring, but a plasmid containing only c-subunit gene did not. Direct interaction of UncI protein with c-subunits was suggested from copurification of His-tagged UncI protein and c-subunits, both {{in the state of}} c 11 -ring and c-monomers. Na+ induced dissociation of His-tagged UncI protein from c 11 -ring but not from c-monomers.

40|$|Transcription {{is known}} to be coupled to {{translation}} in many or all <b>bacterial</b> <b>operons</b> which code for proteins. In these operons, nonsense codons which prevent normal translation often result in premature termination of transcription (polarity). However, efficient transcription of ribosomal ribonucleic acid operons (rrn operons) occurs, although rrn transcripts are not translated. It therefore seemed possible that insertion sequences and transposable elements which are polar in protein-coding operons might not be polar in rrn operons. Previously, it has been shown (E. A. Morgan, Cell 21 : 257 - 265, 1980) that Tn 10 is incompletely polar in the rrnX operon. Here we show that the transposon Tn 9 and the insertion sequence IS 1 also incompletely polar in rrnX. In normal cells expression of sequences distal to the insertions can be detected by genetic methods. In ultraviolet-irradiated cells expression of distal sequences is about 80 % of that observed in uninterrupted rrnX operons. These observations provide evidence that ribonucleic acid polymerase molecules beginning at rrnX promoters can read through Tn 9 and IS 1 and that, at least in ultraviolet-irradiated cells, read-through is very efficient...|$|R

Previous genetic analysis indicated that this locus is defined by two complementation groups, MALp and MALg. MALp reportedly is a regulatory gene required for inducible synthesis of the two enzymatic functions needed for fermentation: maltose permease and maltase. We have investigated the physical and genetic structure of the MAL 6 locus, which has been isolated on a recombinant DNA plasmid. One subclone of the region, pDF- 1, was found to encode a single transcribed region and to contain the MALp gene. A second subclone, p 1, was shown to contain the MALg function but surprisingly had not one but two maltose-inducible transcripts. Subclones having only one of these transcribed regions lacked MALg activity. The three transcribed regions have been named MAL 61 and MAL 62, which correspond to MALg, and MAL 63, which corresponds to MALp.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} whereby {{the formation of}} gene clusters in bacteria is mediated by transfer of DNA within and among taxa. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>operons</b> are typically composed of genes whose products contribute to a single function. If this function is subject to weak selection or to long periods with no selection, the contributing genes may accumulate mutations and be lost by genetic drift. From a cell's perspective, once several genes are lost, the function can be restored only if all missing genes were acquired simultaneously by lateral transfer. The probability of transfer of multiple genes increases when genes are physically proximate. From a gene's perspective, horizontal transfer provides a way to escape evolutionary loss by allowing colonization of organisms lacking the encoded functions. Since organisms bearing clustered genes {{are more likely to}} act as successful donors, clustered genes would spread among bacterial genomes. The physical proximity of genes may be considered a selfish property of the operon since it affects the probability of successful horizontal transfer but may provide no physiological benefit to the host. This process predicts a mosaic structure of modern genomes in which ancestral chromosomal material is interspersed with novel, horizontally transferred operons providing peripheral metabolic functions...|$|R

The sck- 1, sck- 2, and sck- 3 mutations modify transcription termination. The growth of lambda, but not of the N-independent lambda variant, lambda nin- 5, is hindered by these mutations, which act either alone or in concert with the bacterial nusA 1 mutation.

CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) {{promises to be a}} robust, easily engineered and scalable platform for regulated gene silencing. However, in M. tuberculosis, the existing Streptococcus pyogenes Cas 9 -based CRISPRi system is of limited utility because of relatively poor knockdown efficiency and proteotoxicity. To address these limitations, we screened eleven diverse Cas 9 orthologues and identified four that are broadly functional for targeted gene knockdown in mycobacteria. The most efficacious of these proteins, the CRISPR 1 Cas 9 from Streptococcus thermophilus (dCas 9 Sth 1), typically achieves 20 - to 100 -fold knockdown of endogenous gene expression with minimal proteotoxicity. In contrast to other CRISPRi systems, dCas 9 Sth 1 -mediated gene knockdown is robust when targeted far from the transcriptional start site, thereby allowing high-resolution dissection of gene function in the context of <b>bacterial</b> <b>operons.</b> We demonstrate the utility of this system by addressing persistent controversies regarding drug synergies in the mycobacterial folate biosynthesis pathway.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to use the vascular system to validate a technique based on the <b>bacterial</b> lac <b>operon</b> system, in which transgene expression can be repressed and de-repressed by an innocuous lactose analogue, IPTG. We have modified an endothelium specific promoter (TIE 2) with synthetic LacO sequences and made transgenic mouse lines with this modified promoter driving expression of mutant forms of connexin 40 and an independently translated reporter, EGFP. We show that tissue specificity of this modified promoter is retained in the vasculature of transgenic mice in spite of the presence of LacO sequences, and that transgene expression is uniform throughout the endothelium of a range of adult systemic and cerebral arteries and arterioles. Moreover, transgene expression can be consistently down-regulated by crossing the transgenic mice with mice expressing an inhibitor protein LacI(R), and in one transgenic line, transgene expression could be de-repressed rapidly by the innocuous inducer, IPTG. We conclude that the modified <b>bacterial</b> lac <b>operon</b> system can be used successfully to validate transgenic phenotypes through a simple breeding schedule with mice homozygous for the LacI(R) protein...|$|R
40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the {{mitochondrial}} genome structure and gene content of a putatively ancestral group of eukaryotes, the cryptophytes, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial DNA of Rhodomonas salina. The 48 [*] 063 bp circular-mapping molecule codes for 2 rRNAs, 27 tRNAs and 40 proteins including 23 components of oxidative phosphorylation, 15 ribosomal proteins and two subunits of tat translocase. One potential protein (ORF 161) is without assigned function. Only two introns occur in the genome; both are present within cox 1 belong to group II and contain RT open reading frames. Primitive genome features include bacteria-like rRNAs and tRNAs, ribosomal protein genes organized in large clusters resembling <b>bacterial</b> <b>operons</b> {{and the presence of}} the otherwise rare genes such as rps 1 and tatA. The highly compact gene organization contrasts with the presence of a 4. 7 kb long, repeat-containing intergenic region. Repeat motifs ∼ 40 – 700 bp long occur up to 31 times, forming a complex repeat structure. Tandem repeats are the major arrangement but the region also includes a large, ∼ 3 kb, inverted repeat and several potentially stable ∼ 40 – 80 bp long hairpin structures. We provide evidence that the large repeat region is involved in replication and transcription initiation, predict a promoter motif that occurs in three locations and discuss two likely scenarios of how this highly structured repeat region might have evolved...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} simple and highly {{accurate}} computational method for operon prediction, based on intergenic distances and functional relationships between the protein products of contiguous genes, as defined by STRING database (Jensen,L. J., Kuhn,M., Stark,M., Chaffron,S., Creevey,C., Muller,J., Doerks,T., Julien,P., Roth,A., Simonovic,M. et al. (2009) STRING 8 –a global view on proteins and their functional interactions in 630 organisms. Nucleic Acids Res., 37, D 412 –D 416). These two parameters were used to train a neural network on a subset of experimentally characterized Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis operons. Our predictive model was successfully tested {{on the set of}} experimentally defined operons in E. coli and B. subtilis, with accuracies of 94. 6 and 93. 3 %, respectively. As far as we know, these are the highest accuracies ever obtained for predicting <b>bacterial</b> <b>operons.</b> Furthermore, in order to evaluate the predictable accuracy of our model when using an organism's data set for the training procedure, and a different organism's data set for testing, we repeated the E. coli operon prediction analysis using a neural network trained with B. subtilis data, and a B. subtilis analysis using a neural network trained with E. coli data. Even for these cases, the accuracies reached with our method were outstandingly high, 91. 5 and 93 %, respectively. These results show the potential use of our method for accurately predicting the operons of any other organism. Our operon predictions for fully-sequenced genomes are available at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Background: Genome {{projects}} {{have provided a}} vast amount of sequence information. Sequence refereed research deposited research comparison between species helps to establish functional catalogues within organisms and to study how they are maintained and modified across phylogenetic groups during evolution. Microarray studies allow us to determine groups of genes with similar temporal regulation and perhaps also common regulatory upstream regions for binding of transcription factors. The integration of sequence and expression data is expected to refine our current annotations and provide some insight into the evolution of gene regulation across organisms. Results: We have investigated how well the protein subcellular localization and functional categories established from clustering of orthologous genes agree with gene-expression data in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. An increase in the resolution of biologically meaningful classes is observed upon the combination of experiments under different conditions. The functional categories deduced by sequence comparison approaches are, in general, preserved at the level of expression and can sometimes interact into larger co-regulated networks, such as the protein translation process. Differences and similarities in the expression between cytoplasmic-mitochondrial and interspecies translation machineries complement evolutionary information from sequence similarity. Conclusions: Combination of several microarray experiments is a powerful tool for the identification of upstream regulatory motifs of yeast genes involved in protein synthesis. Comparison of these yeast co-regulated genes against the archaeal and <b>bacterial</b> <b>operons</b> indicates that the components of the protein translation process are conserved across organisms at the expression level with minor specific adaptations. ...|$|R
50|$|Processive antitermination {{was first}} {{discovered}} in a bacteriophage, but examples have since been found in <b>bacterial</b> <b>operons.</b> The E. coli rrn operons are regulated by an antitermination mechanism that is dependent on sites that {{are closely related to}} lambda boxA and located promoter proximal to the 16S and 23S structural genes in each operon. The sequences of the rrn BOXA sites are more similar to the bacteriophage consensus than is that of lambda, and they bind NusB-S10 more efficiently. Although stem-loop structures analogous to BOXB are found promoter proximal to the BOXA sites, they are not essential for antitermination. An rrn BOXA sequence confers full antitermination activity against Rho-dependent but not against intrinsic terminators. BOXA also increases the rate of transcription elongation by RNAP. Point mutations in BOXA induce premature transcription termination. rrn antitermination requires NusB in vivo, as shown by a NusB depletion experiment. NusA stimulates the elongation rate of rrn RNA chains carrying BOXA. A role for NusA is further suggested by the observation that the nusA10 (Cs) mutation inhibits both antitermination and the rate of transcription elongation in an rrn operon. The role of other Nus factors in rrn regulation in vivo is not clear. In vitro, an antitermination complex that includes NusA, NusB, S10, and NusG forms at the BOXA sequence of rrnG, but these components are not sufficient for antitermination by themselves. An additional factor or factors that can be supplied by a cellular extract are required, but their identities are unknown.|$|R
40|$|Glutarate, a side-product in the {{metabolism}} of tryptophan and lysine, is metabolized by {{conversion to}} glutaryl-CoA by a transferase using succinyl-CoA as a coenzyme donor. The enzyme catalyzing this conversion {{has not been}} formally identified. However, a benign form of glutaric aciduria (glutaric aciduria type III) is due to mutations in C 7 orf 10, a putative member of the coenzyme A transferase class III family. In the present work, we show that recombinant human C 7 orf 10 catalyzes the succinyl-CoA-dependent conversion of glutarate to glutaryl-CoA. C 7 orf 10 could use many dicarboxylic acids as CoA acceptors, the best ones being glutarate, succinate, adipate, and 3 -hydroxymethylglutarate. Confocal microscopy analysis of CHO cells transfected with a C 7 orf 10 -GFP fusion protein indicated that C 7 orf 10 is a mitochondrial protein, {{in agreement with the}} presence of a predicted mitochondrial propeptide at its N-terminus. The effect of a missense mutation (p. Arg 336 Trp) found in the homozygous state in several patients with glutaric aciduria type III and present in the general population at a low frequency was also investigated. The p. Arg 336 Trp mutation led to the production of insoluble and inactive C 7 orf 10 both in Escherichia coli and in HEK 293 T cells. These findings indicate that C 7 orf 10 is implicated in the metabolism of glutarate, but possibly also of longer dicarboxylic acids. Homologues of this enzyme are found in numerous <b>bacterial</b> <b>operons</b> comprising also a putative glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase, indicating that an enzyme with similar specificity exists in prokaryotes...|$|R
