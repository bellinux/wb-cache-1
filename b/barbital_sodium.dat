40|$|A {{study of}} the in vitro effects such {{chemicals}} as adenine, aureomycin, benzyl adenine, niacin and sodium barbital have on morphogenetic patterns in the water mold Allomyces macrogynus, has been conducted. Cultures of A. macrogynus have been grown on one-fourth strength Emerson 2 ̆ 7 s YpSs agar supplemented with each chemical. A nonsupplemented one-fourth strength YpSs agar served as the control. All cultures were grown under normal laboratory temperature and light conditions for a three-week period. Microscopic observations were made {{at the end of}} 7, 15 and 21 days {{to determine the extent of}} morphogenetic variations induced by the chemicals. At concentrations of 38 /ml adenine and 38 /ml benzyl adenine a higher percentage of male gametangia formed on gametothalli. Concentrations of 0. 1 mg/ml benzyl adenine were found to induce a higher percentage of Z. S. to R.

Concentrations of 38 /ml of benzyl adenine and 91 /ml of <b>barbital</b> <b>sodium</b> were found to induce a higher percentage of R. S. on gametothalli. Concentrations of 91 /ml of <b>barbital</b> <b>sodium</b> and 48 /ml of aureomycin were found to induce 2 ̆ 2 hyphal 2 ̆ 2 protuberations from Z.

40|$|Vimentin {{expression}} was studied immunohistochemically in renal cortical tubules of untreated male rats of various ages, rats exposed to toxins (<b>barbital</b> <b>sodium,</b> folic acid) and carcinogens (streptozotocin, N-bis(2 -hydroxypropyl) nitrosamine, <b>barbital</b> <b>sodium,</b> and in humans of various ages {{with or without}} renal epithelial tumors. Fetal, neonatal, and young adult rats did not express vimentin in renal cortical tubules. Regenerative renal tubular lesions from rats with aging nephropathy and from rats with toxic nephropathy both expressed vimentin. Mitogenic lesions induced by folic acid at 24 hours, however, were not immunoreactive for vimentin. Carcinogen-induced preneoplastic renal cortical tubular lesions in rats were most often focally immunoreactive whereas strong vimentin {{expression was}} found in almost all induced renal tumors. In kidneys of three children (younger than 2 years of age), vimentin was not found in renal cortical tubular cells except in rare individual cells in one case. Vimentin was abundant in basophilic regenerative tubules in kidneys of aged individuals, however. Most (7 / 10) human renal carcinomas and latent preneoplastic or neoplastic renal tubular lesions found incidentally at autopsy (2 / 4) showed vimentin expression. The authors suggest that the switching to vimentin expression in phenotypically normal renal cortical tubular cells in rats and humans, which do not usually express the intermediate filament protein vimentin, should be considered vimentin metaplasia. Vimentin expression is dissociated from increased cell proliferation in hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions, however.

Materials and Methods:The experimental animals (30 mice-weighing 25 - 30 g) were divided into 3 groups (10 /group), the first group served as a control group (i. e. injection with saline), while the other two groups were treated daily with the therapeutic dose of 60 mg/kg. b. wt <b>sodium</b> <b>barbital</b> (i. p.) for 7 days (short-term group) and 21 days (long-term group) as repeated daily doses. Blood sera and kidney samples were collected for physiological, histological and histochemical studies. Results:The results obtained showed a significant increase in urea, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid and creatinine levels in all treated groups. On the other hand serum total protein and albumin levels showed a significant decrease in both treated groups, while the globulin showed a significant decrease only in the long term group. The applied dose of <b>sodium</b> <b>barbital</b> caused histophathological alterations in the renal tissue mainly in the cortex such as damage and shrinkage of the Malpighian corpuscles, cloudy swelling and necrosis of the cells of the proximal convoluted tubules. Also, distal convoluted tubules exhibited degenerated features.

40|$|Four {{hexavalent}} and two trivalent chromium compounds {{were tested}} for toxicity and mutagenicity {{by means of}} the Salmonella typhimurium/mammalian-microsome test.

The distinctive sensitivity of the four Salmonella strains tested (TA 1535, TA 1537, TA 98, and TA 100) suggested that hexavalent chromium directly interacts with bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid by causing both frameshift mutations and basepair substitutions. The latter mutations, which are prevalent, are amplified by an error-prone recombinational repair of the damaged deoxyribonucleic acid. On the average, 1 μmol of hexavalent chromium yielded approximately 500 revertants of the TA 100 strain, irrespective of the compound tested (sodium dichromate, calcium chromate, potassium chromate, or chromic acid).

The turkeys were divided into five treatment groups and the rate of decline in tissue dieldrin was determined periodically during a 68 -day period. Compared to a normal feeding program, the use of a ration high in fiber (33 % ground alfalfa) or a ration high in energy and protein did not accelerate dieldrin depletion from body fat.

The demonstration of a coagulation abnormality in blood of a rabbit deficient in the sixth component of complement (C 6) and its correction with purified C 6 has provided direct evidence for the involvement of complement in normal hemostasis (8).

40|$|Since {{alterations}} in cell-plasma ratios are {{of paramount importance}} {{in the assessment of}} periplieral resistance, a study of pressure-flow relations was made in which blood having wide hematocrit values was perfused through a dog's hind limb in which collateral circulation has been excluded. When vessels were moderately dilated by denervation, the relative apparent viscosity was not affected by the perfusion pressure. When, however, the vessels were maximally dilated after a pre-ceding period of anoxia, the relative apparent viscosity was found to become greater as perfusion pressure was progressively reduced. The in vivo relative apparent viscosity did not significantly exceed that of plasma until the erythrocyte concentration reached 30 per cent. A VERY marked difference has beenobserved between the apparent vis-cosity of blood measured in living tissues and the values obtained in capillary viscometers. The most comprehensive study of the relationships between the erythrocyte concentration of the blood and its apparent viscosity in living tissues was reported in 1933 by Whittaker and Winton. 1 However, several cardinal features of this work were subjected to criticism by Green and his collaborators. 2 Two of the principal objections were that the blood vessels in the isolated perfused extrem-ities were maximally dilated, and that no pre-cautions were instituted to prevent outflow of blood from nonligated collateral channels. Since it is of paramount importance to be able to gage the change in peripheral resistance incident to any alteration in hematocrit ratio under a wide variety of physiologic and patho-logic conditions, this problem was reinvesti-gated using improved experimental technics.

The occurrence of quiescence requires the presence of at least 2 mM Ca 21 in the seawater, and the percentage of sperm quiescent at any one time increases substantially when the sperm are illuminated with blue light. With intense illumination, close to 100 % of the sperm become quiescent, and this percentage decreases gradually to ^- 0. 3 % over a 104 -fold decrease in light intensity. An increased concentration of K+ in the seawater also increases the percentage of quiescence, with a majority of the sperm being quiescent in seawater containing 80 mM KCI. The induction of quiescence by light or by increased KCl is completely inhibited by 10 1 uM chlorpromazine, and- 90 % inhibited by 1 mM procaine or <b>sodium</b> <b>barbital.</b> Sperm treated with the divalent-cation ionophore A 23187 swim quite normally, although for a relatively short period, in artificial seawater lacking divalent cations, but are abruptly arrested upon addition of 0. 04 - 0. 2 mM free Ca 2 +.

Among the factors that may produce this reflux, there is one that has not been experimentally investigated in the living animal, as far as we know, although its theoretical significance has been mentioned by Sexton (6) and by Gruber (5). This factor is an edema of the ureterovesical valve. In the following pages, we shall submit evidence that an acute, experimental, non-inflammatory, non-obstructive edema of the ureteral valve region in the living animal causes a temporary reflux of vesical contents into the ureters and kidneys. It will further be shown that this experimental reflux may occur when the driving force is merely the hydrostatic pressure of the urine in the bladder of a recumbent animal (2 to 3 ram. of tIg in dog).

40|$|Drugs {{of abuse}} {{are thought to}} have the common action of {{increasing}} dopaminergie transmission in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) pathway, specifically in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, sedative-hypnotics, including the barbiturates, are anomalous in that they appear to stimulate DA release from the NAc at doses that are generally lower than their reinforcing doses. The fact that barbiturates {{have a long history of}} abuse in humans and are potent reinforcers in laboratory animals, but are behaviourally reinforcing only at doses that decrease DA release from the NAc, raises questions about the neuropharmacological mechanism of reinforcement in these drugs. Indeed, of the numerous studies that have examined the reinforcing properties of barbiturates, none have examined the pharmacological basis of their reinforcing effects. The conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm is a widely used behavioural test that assesses the reinforcing capacity of stimuli by the ability of conditioned stimuli to evoke an approach response. Using this paradigm, systemic administration of pentobarbital (15 mg/kg) induced a significant place preference. Furthermore, pretreatment with GABAA, DA, and opioid receptor antagonists blocked the pentobarbital-induced place preference. <b>Sodium</b> <b>barbital,</b> a longer-acting barbiturate also induced a significant CPP when systemically administered (8 and 24 mg/kg). Moreover, the reinforcing effect of this place preference is centrally mediated, assessed by the significant CPP obtained with intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of barbital (240 and 480 mug). A number of different brain sites are involved in the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse. Microinjections of barbital into the periaqueductal gray (25 mug) or posterior ventral tegmental area (VTA; 15 mug), but not into other areas, such as the amygdala and anterior VTA, produced a place preference. Furthermore, opioid (naloxone methiodide) and GABAA receptor (SR 95531) antagonists administered into these areas blocked the ICV barbital place preference. Given these findings, barbiturate reinforcement appears to be mediated by the same neural substrates and neurochemical systems as other drugs of abuse, such as opiates and ethanol. The implications of these results and the use of barbital in the place preference paradigm to investigate the neuropharmacological mechanisms of barbiturate reinforcement are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which hypoxia or social isolation interact with drug action were investigated {{by the use of}} several parameters including drug-induced narcosis, convulsions, change in body temperature and various biochemical parameters. Acute Hypoxia Hypobaric hypoxia (364 mm Hg, 10 % O 2) enhanced. the depressant effects of barbital, pentobarbital and chloral hydrate in mice and rats. Mice were far more sensitive than rats, barbital narcosis being affected to the greatest extent. Reduced oxygen (10 %) at normal pressure also potentiated pentobarbital narcosis. Hypothermia during hypoxia was greater in mice than in rats. Mice exposed to hypoxia at 30 °C instead of 22 °C ambient temperature did not exhibit hypothermia. Hypoxia at 22 °C enhanced and prolonged the hypothermia induced by barbiturates and chloral hydrate. At 30 °C hypoxia showed considerably less potentiation of barbital narcosis and hypothermia than at 22 °C. These parameters were moderately reduced with chloral hydrate and unaffected with respect to pentobarbital. Convulsions produced by intraperitoneal semicarbasize, m-fluorotyrosine or methionine sulphomimine were significantly reduced in mice exposed to hypoxia. Seizures due to intracerebral semicarbazide were also antagonized by hypoxia. Hypoxic mice showed lower body concentration of pentobarbital on awakening and reduced rate of pentobarbital disappearance from the body than animals breathing room atmosphere. Administration of sodium nitrate to mice markedly potentiated barbiturate narcosis. The hypothermia and methemoglobinemia produced by nitrite showed a temporal relationship to the potentiation of hexobarbital narcosis. Both reduction in body temperature and enhancement of <b>barbital</b> narcosis after <b>sodium</b> nitrite were prevented at 30 °C ambient temperature, but potentiation of hexobarbital narcosis was unaffected. Disappearance of hexobarbital from the whole-body of nitrite-treated mice was slower and barbiturate concentration at awakening was lower in these animals as compared to control mice. Sodium nitrite did not inhibit hexobarbital metabolism in vitro or affect hexobarbital narcosis when injected intracerebrally. Methylene blue effectively reduced nitrite-induced methemoglobinemia, but markedly potentiated barbiturate narcosis in the absence of nitrite. Seizures produced by intracerebral semicarbazide were antagonized by sodium nitrite injection. Brain and plasma levels of intraperitoneal barbital C 14 were reduced after exposure to hypobaric hypoxia or injection of sodium nitrite when the labelled compound was given with a depressant dose (300 mg/kg) of unlabeled barbital. Excretion of barbital C 14, as measured by brain and plasma levels 6 h after intraperitoneal injection, was lower in mice subjected to barbiturate narcosis during hypobaric hypoxia. Exposure to hypoxia or injection of sodium nitrite did not affect penetration of intravenously administered barbital C 14 into brain. These data suggest that hypoxia due to low ambient oxygen or injection of sodium nitrite decreases absorption, metabolism and excretion of barbiturates and lowers the threshold of brain neurons to drug-induced depression. Social Isolation Narcosis due to hexobarbital, pentobarbital, chloral hydrate or barbital was markedly reduced in male mice after 5 weeks of social deprivation. Socially deprived female mice also showed a decreased response to hexobarbital narcosis. However, only isolated males developed aggressiveness. The metabolism of hexobarbital both in vivo and in vitro was enhanced in isolated animals. Mice deprived of social interactions gained righting reflect at a higher body level of hexobarbital as compared to the underpriced animals. Development of aggressiveness in isolated male mice did not correlate temporally with the reduced response to hexobarbital. Gonadectomy, but not adrenalectomy effectively prevented reduction of barbiturate potency and development of aggressiveness in socially deprived male mice. Latency to avoidance of paw shock was significantly lower in socially deprived male mice. In addition, the decrement in avoidance produced by chlorpromazine in grouped mice was less pronounced in the deprived animals. These data show that chronic deprivation of social stimuli in mice increased the drug metabolizing activity of hepatic microsomes and raised arousal levels such that CNS susceptibility to drugs and physical stimuli was altered. In addition, the anabolic steroids appear to be involved in this response. These observations further suggest that alterations in barbituated sensitivity and development of aggressiveness after social deprivation may have a different biological basis...|$|R
40|$|Effects of the {{probiotic}} Enterococcus faecium SF 68 (NCIMB 10415) in pigs: Influences of {{the small}} intestine The benefit of probiotics on the hosts intestinal mucosa is well established, however not much is known about their influence on the morphology of the intestinal epithelium. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the influence of a probiotic diet on the morphology of the intestinal mucosa in the pig. A total of 40 piglets age 14, 28 (age of weaning), 35 and 56 days were examined. Each age-group consisted of five animals derived from sows (Duroc x Deutsche Landrasse) which were provided with an Enterococcus faecium (NCIMB 10415, Cyclactin®, Roche) supplemented diet. Likewise, five control piglets of each age group were derived from sows fed a normal, unsupplemented diet. Sows of the probiotic group were fed the E. faecium supplemented diet beginning at day 25 of gestation. Tissue samples were collected immediately following sacrifice of animals by euthanasia with <b>sodium</b> <b>barbital</b> at 8. 30 h a. m. Samples for light- and electronmicroscopic, histochemical, immunhistochemical and morphometric determinations were taken from duodenum, proximal and distal jejunum, ileum, caecum, colon ascendens and colon descendens. The collected samples were fixed in Bouins fluid and 2 % Paraformeldehyde + 2. 5 % Glutaraldehyde in 0. 1 M Cacodylate buffer (pH 7. 5) for light- and electron microscopic studies, respectively. Morphometric analysis was carried out with a computerized image analysis program Lucia 32 -G Corona 4. 11  (Nokia) for villus length, crypt depth, ratio of villus length to crypt depth and calculation of enlargement factor for the villus and crypt surface. Mucosal substances present in Goblet cells or surface coat were stained with the periodate acid Schiff (PAS) / Alcian Blue method. Evaluation of cell turnover rate was carried out with the help of the monoclonal antibody MIB- 1 against the nucleus associated protein Ki 67. Activities of programmed cell death were detected using the TUNEL-, Apostain- and Caspase 3 methods. Scanning electron microscopic studies of the mucosal surface showed considerable variations particularly in duodenum and proximal jejunum within the control and probiotic group. In addition to the most common tongue-and fingershaped villi, crestlike villi were also observed particularly in the duodenum and ileum. These differences however cannot be ascribed to feeding or age. With regard to villus lengths, for both control and probiotic- fed piglets it was found that at age of 35 days (seven days after weaning) the villi were much shorter than in the older or younger animals. This age- dependent phenomenon was also observed in the decreasing villus: crypt ratios and the enlargement factor of the surface of the intestinal mucosa, or the decrease of the number of goblet cells in the villi of duodenum and ileum and the crypts of duodenum and cecum. The Crypts of Lieberkühn were generally deeper in the colon than in the small intestines, depths increased in all intestinal segments with increasing age. The ratio of villus length and crypt depth showed the highest values in the jejunum. The enlargement factor for the intestinal surface due to crypt formation in the jejunum and ileum differed significantly compared to the colon segments (p < 0, 05). An age-dependent increase of the enlargement factor here was not as apparent as in the crypt depth. In both the proximal and distal jejunum as well as in the colon ascendens the enlargement factor increased up to day 35, but decreasing again by day 56 to a lower level. In the area of the intestinal villi of the duodenum the number of goblet cells per mm in 14 day- old, E. faecium fed piglets were significantly (p The qualitative evaluation of the goblet cells indicated that these cells showed positive reactions with Alcian-blue throughout the intestinal tract. In contrast, the intestinal mucous coat showed positive reactions with Alcian-blue in the small intestines and PAS-positive mainly in the colon ascendens. Regarding cell turnover rates, the number of mitotically active cells was highest in the crypts of the jejunum. These data clearly differed from those of the duodenum and the colon segments in all age groups. The methods for detection of programmed cell death (apoptosis) did not produce reliable results. The results generally showed that apart from the differences found during the quantitative evaluation of the goblet cells between controls and probiotic fed piglets, no clear group- specific effect was observed for the majority of the various parameters in the intestinal tract. Supplementation of sows and piglets with the probiotic E. faecium strain used in this study did not appear to influence the morphology of either the small or large intestine. </p...|$|R
