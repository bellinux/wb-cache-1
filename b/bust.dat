5|$|The French book, Le Buste de Nefertiti– une Imposture de l'Egyptologie? (The <b>Bust</b> of Nefertiti– a Fraud in Egyptology?) by Swiss art {{historian}} Henri Stierlin {{and the book}} Missing Link in Archaeology by Berlin author and historian Erdogan Ercivan both claimed that the Nefertiti <b>bust</b> was a modern fake. Stierlin claims that Borchardt may have created the <b>bust</b> to test ancient pigments and that when the <b>bust</b> was admired by Prince Johann Georg of Saxony, Borchardt pretended it was genuine to avoid offending the prince. Stierlin argues that the missing left eye of the <b>bust</b> {{would have been a}} sign of disrespect in ancient Egypt, that no scientific records of the <b>bust</b> appear until 11 years after its supposed discovery, and while the paint pigments are ancient, the inner limestone core has never been dated. Ercivan suggests Borchardt's wife was the model for the <b>bust,</b> and both authors argue that it was not revealed to the public until 1924 because it was a fake. Another theory suggested that the existing Nefertiti <b>bust</b> was crafted in the 1930s on Hitler's orders, and that the original was lost in World War II.|$|E
5|$|The same {{building}} {{was also the}} site of the discovery in 1918 of a bronze <b>bust</b> of outstanding quality depicting Cato the Younger. One of the most notable artefacts discovered at Volubilis, it is now on display in the Archaeological Museum in Rabat. It was still on its original pedestal when it was found by archaeologists. The <b>bust</b> has been dated to the time of Nero or Vespasian and may be a copy of a <b>bust</b> created in Cato's lifetime or shortly thereafter. Its inscription identifies its subject as the orator. Another outstanding <b>bust,</b> depicting a Hellenistic prince, was discovered in a bakery across the street. It seems to have been made {{at the same time as}} the Cato <b>bust</b> and may well have come from the House of Venus, where an empty pedestal in another room suggests that the Cato had a companion piece. The <b>bust,</b> which is also on display in Rabat, is usually identified as Juba II but other possibilities include Hiero II of Syracuse, Cleomenes III of Sparta, Juba I or Hannibal.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effectiveness of}} using three-dimensional, visual, digital representations of human heads and faces (i. e., virtual <b>busts)</b> for person identification. In a series of 11 studies, participants learned a number of human faces from analog photographs. We then crafted virtual <b>busts</b> from those analog photographs, and compared recognition of photographs of the virtual <b>busts</b> to the original analog photographs. We demonstrated that the accuracy of person identification using photographs of virtual <b>busts</b> is high in an absolute sense, but {{not as high as}} using the original analog photographs. We present a paradigm for comparing the similarity, both structural (objectively similar in shape) and subjective (subjectively in the eyes of a viewer) of virtual <b>busts</b> to analog photographs, with the goal of beginning the discussion of a uniform standard for assessing the fidelity of digital models of human faces.

40|$|Assertive Outreach (AO) {{services}} {{have been a}} key part of mental health services in the UK since 1999 with the primary aim of improving engagement with services and treatments and reducing the need for care.

Case <b>busts</b> are one process introduced to AO teams in the West Midlands in response to concerns about risk. They are a multi-disciplinary team meeting that proposes to facilitate communication and to inform care. This study sets out to explore the experience and understanding of case <b>busts</b> for AO workers in two teams in the West Midlands from a range of professional perspectives. Data were analysed using template analysis. Four overarching themes emerged from the data: case busts: information sharing is a valuable function of the case bust; case <b>busts</b> are not a fully shared process; case <b>busts</b> are a process in need of structure and leadership; case <b>busts</b> only have a clear consistent impact on defensive risk management practice. It is recommended that formulation method in case <b>busts</b> is reviewed and that psychologists consider how to provide leadership in case <b>busts</b> within AO teams. ...|$|R
