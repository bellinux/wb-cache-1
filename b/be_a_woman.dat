However, the goddesses dissuaded {{him and told him}} that life as a woman was a curse and full of sorrow. Ilā bathed in a sacred pool and returned as Ela, bearded and deep-voiced.|$|E

Although the requirement for public servants was dropped in the Broadcasting and Television Act of 1956, the need for seven commissioners was retained - this allowed for each state and territory to be represented.|$|E
25|$|These changes {{arrived with}} season {{eighteen}} {{in the autumn}} of 1980, when the audience for Doctor Who had fallen dramatically to around five million viewers, due chiefly to competition from the ITV network's American import Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. There was a further blow when Tom Baker decided that after seven seasons in the part he would leave the role. His departure was heavily publicised in the press, with Baker attracting much comment for his tongue-in-cheek suggestion that his successor could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> which the publicity-aware Nathan-Turner was not quick to deny.|$|E

She has rows with other female residents, including Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), Angie Watts (Anita Dobson), Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton), Mary Smith (Linda Davidson) and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), whom she suspects are trying to seduce her husband, although in truth, all that ever occurs is flirtation.|$|E

25|$|Tribes {{often have}} {{initiation}}s. The initiation {{done in the}} Bapedi tribe of South Africa is normally regarded as a stage where a boy is to be taught manhood and a girl to be taught womanhood. In many African tribes, initiation involves circumcision/genital mutilation of males and sometimes circumcision/genital mutilation of females as well. Initiation is considered necessary for the individual {{to be regarded as}} a full member of the tribe. Otherwise, the individual may not be allowed to participate in ceremonies or even in social rituals such as marriage. A man {{will not be allowed to}} marry or have any special relationship with a woman who did not go to an initiation, because she is not considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b>|$|E
25|$|Musicologists {{have put}} forth {{examples}} of that 4th-century BC technology, looking at engraved images that have survived. The earliest image showing a lute-like instrument came from Mesopotamia prior to 3000 BC. A cylinder seal from c. 3100 BC or earlier (now {{in the possession}} of the British Museum) shows what is thought to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> playing a stick lute. From the surviving images, theororists have categorized the Mesopotamian lutes, showing that they developed into a long variety and a short. The line of long lutes may have developed into the tamburs and pandura. The line of short lutes was further developed to the east of Mesopotamia, in Bactria, Gandhara, and Northwest India, and shown in sculpture from the 2nd century BC through the 4th or 5th centuries AD.|$|E
25|$|Inheritance was by descent, {{but could}} be further {{restricted}} by entailment, which would restrict inheritance to male heirs only. In {{the case of the}} Bennet family, Mr. Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr. Bennet's death and his proposal to Elizabeth would have ensured her future security. Nevertheless, she refuses his offer. Inheritance laws benefited males because most women did not have independent legal rights until {{the second half of the}} 19th century. As a consequence, women's financial security at that time depended on men. For the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and her future children. The irony of the novel's opening line, therefore, is that generally within this society it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who would be looking for a wealthy husband in order to have prosperous life.|$|E
