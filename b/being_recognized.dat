5|$|Rivalry between Brooks and Clayton predated the 1868 election. Clayton saw Brooks as {{his strongest}} {{competitor}} for preference and distinction {{and did not}} want him to become too entrenched with the party leadership. Brooks felt that his ability and service to the party were not <b>being</b> <b>recognized</b> or appreciated, and he grew bitter and resentful of the other Republicans, including Clayton.|$|E

5|$|The purported {{survival}} of Anastasia {{has been the}} subject of both cinema and made-for-television films. The earliest, made in 1928, was called Clothes Make the Woman.

5|$|Braille worked tirelessly on his ideas, and {{his system}} was largely {{completed}} by 1824, {{when he was}} fifteen years old. From Barbier's night writing, he innovated by simplifying its form and maximizing its efficiency. He made uniform columns for each letter, and he reduced the twelve raised dots to six. He published his system in 1829, and by the second edition in 1837 he had discarded the dashes {{because they were too}} difficult to read. Crucially, Braille's smaller cells were capable of <b>being</b> <b>recognized</b> as letters with a single touch of a finger.|$|E
50|$|His most {{significant}} contribution {{is the concept}} of the consciousness of kind, which is a state of mind whereby one conscious <b>being</b> <b>recognizes</b> another as <b>being</b> of like mind. All human motives organize themselves around consciousness of kind as a determining principle. Association leads to conflict which leads to consciousness of kind through communication, imitation, toleration, co-operation, and alliance. Eventually the group achieves a self-consciousness of its own (as opposed to individual self-consciousness) from which traditions and social values can arise.|$|R

5|$|Isaac Desha left Kentucky {{and assumed}} an alias. He went to New Orleans. From there, he {{traveled}} {{with a man}} named Thomas Early to San Antonio, Texas. When Early went missing during their travels, Desha fell under suspicion. A former Kentuckian living in Texas recognized Desha. Arrested soon after Early's body was found, Desha confessed to the murder after <b>being</b> <b>recognized</b> by a second man from Kentucky. A day before his trial was to start, Desha died of a fever. A legend soon arose that he had faked his death and fled to Hawaii, where he married a native woman and fathered several children. Later historians have debunked that myth.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the condition represents a state of heightened sensitivity to antigenic stimuli, with cross-reactivity of the resulting cell-mediated immune response with cells of the epithelium. Some hypothesize that aphthous stomatitis is caused by expression of HLA class II antigens along with the normally found HLA class I antigens in epithelial cells, which results in them <b>being</b> <b>recognized</b> by the immune system as foreign cells rather than self. Various antigenic triggers have been implicated as a trigger, including L forms of streptococci, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus tao is {{a fossil}} bat in the genus Miniopterus from the Pleistocene of Zhoukoudian in China.

Miniopterus tao is larger than living M. schreibersii and has more closely spaced lower premolars and more robust talonids (back groups of cusps) on the lower molars. The back part of the mandible is relatively low and on it, the coronoid and condyloid processes are about equally high. The average length of the mandible is 12.0mm.|$|E

50|$|All {{human beings}} have a similar {{resistance}} to most biological agents and exposures with some exCEptions (e.g. UV-rays short time duty or allergies) but the human gene sequences are remarkably homogeneous, {{so that there is}} a quite good standardisation and all human <b>beings</b> <b>recognize</b> their similars as such and automatically know which short time duties they can withstand.

5|$|The Marshall Islands and Tuvalu gained National Olympic Committee {{status in}} 2006 and 2007 respectively, and 2008 {{was the first}} games {{in which they were}} {{eligible}} to participate. The states of Serbia and Montenegro, which participated at the 2004 Games jointly as Serbia and Montenegro, competed separately for the first time. The Montenegrin Olympic Committee was accepted as a new National Olympic Committee in 2007. Neighboring Kosovo, however, did not participate. After the declaration of independence in Kosovo, the IOC specified requirements that Kosovo needs to meet before <b>being</b> <b>recognized</b> by the IOC; most notably, it has to be recognized as independent by the United Nations. China and the United States had the largest teams, with 639 athletes for China and 596 for the United States.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. had intervened {{repeatedly}} in Mexico under Wilson, and had withdrawn diplomatic recognition, setting conditions for reinstatement. The Mexican government under President Álvaro Obregón wanted recognition before negotiations, but Wilson and his final Secretary of State, Bainbridge Colby, refused. Both Hughes and Fall opposed recognition; Hughes instead sent a draft treaty to the Mexicans in May 1921, which included pledges to reimburse Americans for losses in Mexico since the 1910 revolution there. Obregón {{was unwilling to}} sign a treaty before <b>being</b> <b>recognized,</b> and worked to improve the relationship between American business and Mexico, reaching agreement with creditors, and mounting a public relations campaign in the United States. This had its effect, and by mid-1922, Fall was less influential than he had been, lessening the resistance to recognition. The two presidents appointed commissioners to reach a deal, and the U.S. recognized the Obregón government on August 31, 1923, just under a month after Harding's death, substantially on the terms proffered by Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Macrinus {{realised}} {{that his}} life was in danger but struggled to decide upon {{a course of action}} and remained at Antioch. He sent a force of cavalry commanded by Ulpinus Julianus to regain control of the rebels, but they failed and Ulpinus died in the attempt. This failure further strengthened Elagabalus' army. Soon after, a force under Elagabalus' tutor Gannys marched on Antioch and engaged Macrinus' army on 8 June 218 near the village of Immae, located approximately 24 miles from Antioch. At some point during the ensuing Battle of Antioch, Macrinus deserted the field and returned to Antioch. Macrinus was then forced to flee from Antioch as fighting erupted in the city as well. Elegabalus himself subsequently entered Antioch as the new ruler of the Roman Empire. Macrinus fled for Rome; he traveled as far as Chalcedon before <b>being</b> <b>recognized</b> and captured. His son and co-emperor Diadumenianus, sent to the care of Artbanus V of Parthia, was himself captured in transit at Zeugma and killed in June of 218. Diadumenianus' reign lasted a total of 14 months, and he was about 10 years old when he died. Macrinus, upon learning of his son's death, tried to escape captivity, but he injured himself in the unsuccessful attempt and was afterward executed in Cappadocia; his head was sent to Elegabalus. Much like Macrinus, Diadumenianus' head was also cut off and sent to Elegabalus as a trophy.|$|E
5|$|My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy {{opens with}} a {{dedication}} to Daws Butler, a list of acknowledgements and a foreword from Cartwright's The Simpsons co-star Dan Castellaneta. The first chapter of the book details Cartwright's life and career prior to 1987. In the second chapter, Cartwright recalls the day she went to audition for a role {{in a series of}} animated shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show. The shorts were about a dysfunctional family and Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa Simpson, the eldest daughter. Upon arriving at the audition, she found the role of her brother Bart to be much more interesting. Matt Groening, creator of the shorts, allowed her to audition for Bart, and gave her the job on the spot after hearing her reading. From there, the book contains her experiences as the voice of Bart. After three seasons of shorts, a half-hour spinoff called The Simpsons debuted in 1989. In the following chapters, she recalls the early days of The Simpsons, commenting on the recording process and her co-stars and revealing how she got the roles of some of the other characters she voices, including Nelson Muntz and Ralph Wiggum. In the 15th chapter, she discusses her experiences of voicing a famous character, but rarely <b>being</b> <b>recognized.</b>|$|E
