First, the quantitative and qualitative {{analysis of}} ferrous <b>burden</b> <b>materials</b> used in blast furnace process was made.

40|$|Increasing {{material}} use {{efficiency is}} important to mitigate future supply risks and minimize environmental impacts associated with {{the production of the}} materials. The policy mix presented in this paper aims to contribute to reducing the use of virgin metals in the EU by 80 % by 2050 without significant shifting of <b>burdens</b> to other <b>material</b> <b>resources,</b> environmental impacts, or parts of the world. We used a heuristic framework and a systems perspective for designing the policy mix that combines primary instruments designed to increase material efficiency, recycling and substitution of materials (a materials tax, the extended producer responsibility, technical regulations, and environmental taxes) and supportive instruments aimed to reduce barriers to implementing the primary instruments and to contribute towards the policy objectives (e. g., research and development support, and advanced recycling centers). Furthermore, instruments were designed so as to increase political feasibility: e. g., taxes were gradually increased as part of a green fiscal reform, and border-tax adjustments were introduced to reduce impacts on competitiveness. However, even in such a policy mix design ongoing ex-ante assessments indicate that the policy mix will be politically difficult to implement—and also fall short of achieving the 80 % reduction target. Nonetheless, we suggest combining primary and supportive instruments into coherent and dynamic policy mixes as a promising step towards system reconfigurations for sustainability...|$|R

University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice. Faculty of Health and Social Studies. Head of {{bachelor}} work Ing. Aleš Kudlák, Ph. D. This {{thesis is}} focused on the issue of municipalities and their requiring <b>material</b> <b>resources</b> in the state property in solving crisis situations. The aim is to assess the municipality possibilities of using the <b>material</b> <b>resources</b> in the state property in crisis situations. In accordance with the assignment this work focuses on the principles of using <b>material</b> <b>resources,</b> comprising movable and immovable assets in state ownership, local government units, physical and legal persons, which can be used during solving the crisis situations. In the theoretical part the legislation of the Czech Republic concerning the use of <b>material</b> <b>resources</b> is described. The following chapter is devoted to information systems, which are used in requesting <b>material</b> <b>resources</b> in the state property. The second part of this thesis is based on a questionnaire sent out to mayors of municipalities in the South Bohemia region. The questionnaire contained thirteen questions. The questions were focused on the possibility of optimization of allocating <b>material</b> <b>resources</b> to civil protection during the solution of the crisis situations. The research question was: What is the awareness regarding the use of <b>material</b> <b>resources</b> owned by the state in solving the crisis situations in the selected municipalities? The questionnaire was sent to all municipalities in the South Bohemia region. Only 9 % of questionnaires were returned. Each question was processed and evaluated separately using a chart. From the results {{it is easy to see}} that the representatives of the municipalities have a clear idea of the <b>material</b> <b>resources</b> available to them. According to our assumption, mayors in larger municipalities or towns are better informed about this issue, probably due to the availability of experts in crisis management...|$|R

Consistent with this idea, a large cross-cultural survey (Study 1) found that both chronic (low income) and situational (inflation) lack of <b>material</b> <b>resources</b> were associated with harsher moral judgments. The effect of inflation was stronger for low-income individuals, whom inflation renders relatively more vulnerable. A follow-up experiment (Study 2) caused participants to perceive they lacked <b>material</b> <b>resources</b> by employing different anchors on the scale they used to report their income. The manipulation led to harsher judgments of harmful, but not of non-harmful, transgressions and this effect was explained by a sense of vulnerability. Alternative explanations were excluded.
