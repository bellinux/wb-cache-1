5|$|STAC {{stated that}} an SST would have {{economic}} performance similar to existing subsonic types. Although they would <b>burn</b> <b>more</b> fuel in cruise, {{they would be}} able to fly more sorties in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, as it did at the time.|$|E
5|$|The exact mass-luminosity {{relationship}} {{depends on}} how efficiently energy can be transported from the core to the surface. A higher opacity has an insulating effect that retains more energy at the core, so the star {{does not need to}} produce as much energy to remain in hydrostatic equilibrium. By contrast, a lower opacity means energy escapes more rapidly and the star must <b>burn</b> <b>more</b> fuel to remain in equilibrium. Note, however, that a sufficiently high opacity can result in energy transport via convection, which changes the conditions needed to remain in equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was part}} of a cavalry force commanded by General Averell that pursued Confederate Generals McCausland and Bradley Johnson after the rebels burned the Pennsylvania community of Chambersburg. After multiple skirmishes and Confederate threats to <b>burn</b> <b>more</b> towns, McCausland's two brigades of cavalry were caught in Moorefield, West Virginia. In a surprise attack at dawn on August 6, 1864, Averell captured over 400 Confederates. This ruined General Early's cavalry, and it was never again the dominant force it once was. In this battle, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry was held in reserve while five other regiments attacked two rebel camps. Colonel Powell directed portions of the attack.|$|E

5|$|About thirty-five {{natural forest}} fires are ignited {{each year by}} lightning, while another six to ten are started by people— in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive {{exhibits}} and an observation deck open to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames. Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September— the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity {{in the late afternoon}} and evening. Few fires <b>burn</b> <b>more</b> than , {{and the vast majority of}} fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5ha) before they burn themselves out. Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed.|$|E

Oxygenates also help gasoline <b>burn</b> <b>more</b> completely, reducing tailpipe emissions from pre-1984 motor vehicles; dilute or displace gasoline components such as aromatics (e.g., benzene) and sulfur; and optimize oxidation during combustion. Before the introduction of other oxygenates and octane enhancers, most refiners had chosen MTBE primarily for its blending characteristics and low cost.|$|E
500|$|In general, {{externally}} generated hot gas {{technologies are}} similar to internal combustion technologies in that they also process oil shale lumps in vertical shaft kilns. Significantly, though, the heat in these technologies is delivered by gases heated outside the retort vessel, and therefore the retort vapors are not diluted with combustion exhaust. The Petrosix and Paraho Indirect employ this technology. In addition to not accepting fine particles as feed, these technologies do not utilize the potential heat of combusting the char on the spent shale and thus must <b>burn</b> <b>more</b> valuable fuels. [...] However, {{due to the lack}} of combustion of the spent shale, the oil shale does not exceed [...] and significant carbonate mineral decomposition and subsequent CO2 generation can be avoided for some oil shales. [...] Also, these technologies tend to be the more stable and easier to control than internal combustion or hot solid recycle technologies.|$|E
500|$|The early {{motion picture}} {{industry}} primarily used nitrocellulose film stock, commonly called nitrate film. This film is flammable, and produces its own oxygen supply as it burns. Nitrate fires burn rapidly, and cannot typically be extinguished, capable of burning even underwater. Additionally, nitrocellulose {{is subject to}} thermal decomposition and hydrolysis, breaking down over time {{in the presence of}} high temperatures and moisture. This decaying film stock releases nitrogen oxides that themselves contribute to the decay and make the damaged film <b>burn</b> <b>more</b> easily. Under the right conditions, nitrate film can even spontaneously combust. In part because of substantial variability in the manufacturing of early film, there is considerable uncertainty about the circumstances necessary for self-ignition. Sustained temperatures of [...] or higher, large quantities of nitrate film, increased humidity, poor ventilation, and aged or decaying film have all been considered risk factors. Most such fires in film archives have taken place in heat waves during summer months, in closed facilities with limited ventilation, exacerbating several of these variables. Especially in confined areas, such fires can result in explosions.|$|E

500|$|Since {{the vessel}} {{was no longer}} {{seaworthy}} and could not move under its own power, even if freed from the beach, {{the focus of the}} operation changed. Oil from the ship's fuel tanks continued to pose an environmental hazard, a situation exacerbated by both the ship's structural failure and continuing pounding from the surf. In order to mitigate the situation, the Unified Command decided to set the fuel tanks on fire in order to burn off the oil. The first attempt was made on February 10. Napalm and other incendiary devices were used to ignite the fuel, but only one of the diesel tanks was burned effectively. A second attempt was made on February 11 when US Navy explosive experts placed 39 shaped charges to breach the top of the fuel tanks from within the cargo holds. 2,280liters of napalm and nearly 180kg of plastic explosives were also used to ignite the fuel on board. The ship burned for approximately 33hours. Additional smaller-scale attempts were made to <b>burn</b> <b>more</b> oil over the next two days, with limited success. The total amount of oil that was burned is estimated to be between [...] The structural stress caused by the fire, combined with continued severe weather, caused the vessel to break into two sections around midnight on February 11.|$|E
500|$|It {{has never}} been firmly {{established}} how the fire on Orient broke out, but one common account is that jars of oil and paint had been left on the poop deck, instead of being properly stowed after painting of the ship's hull had been completed shortly before the battle. Burning wadding {{from one of the}} British ships is believed to have floated onto the poop deck and ignited the paint. The fire rapidly spread through the admiral's cabin and into a ready magazine that stored carcass ammunition, which was designed to <b>burn</b> <b>more</b> fiercely in water than in air. Alternatively, Fleet Captain Honoré Ganteaume later reported the cause as an explosion on the quarterdeck, preceded by a series of minor fires on the main deck among the ship's boats. Whatever its origin, the fire spread rapidly through the ship's rigging, unchecked by the fire pumps aboard, which had been smashed by British shot. A second blaze then began at the bow, trapping hundreds of sailors in the ship's waist. Subsequent archaeological investigation found debris scattered over [...] of seabed and evidence that the ship was wracked by two huge explosions one after the other. Hundreds of men dove into the sea to escape the flames, but fewer than 100 survived the blast. British boats picked up approximately 70 survivors, including the wounded staff officer Léonard-Bernard Motard. A few others, including Ganteaume, managed to reach the shore on rafts. The remainder of the crew, numbering more than 1,000 men, were killed, including Captain Casabianca and his son, Giocante.|$|E
500|$|In 1837 Bird {{took part}} in an {{investigation}} of the dangers posed by the arsenic content of cheap candles. [...] These were stearin candles with white arsenic added, which made them <b>burn</b> <b>more</b> brightly than ordinary candles. [...] The combination of cheapness and brightness made them popular. [...] The investigation was conducted by the Westminster Medical Society, a student society of Westminster Hospital, and was led by John Snow, later to become famous for his public health investigations. [...] Snow had previously investigated arsenic poisoning when he and several fellow students were taken badly ill after he introduced a new process for preserving cadavers at the suggestion of lecturer Hunter Lane. [...] The new process involved injecting arsenic into the blood vessels of the corpse. [...] Snow found that the arsenic became airborne as a result of chemical reactions with the decomposing corpse, and this was how it was ingested. [...] Bird's part in the candle investigation was to analyse the arsenic content of the candles, which he found to have recently been greatly increased by the manufacturers. [...] Bird also confirmed by experiment that the arsenic became airborne when the candles were burnt. [...] The investigators exposed various species of animal and bird to the candles in controlled conditions. [...] The animals all survived, but the birds died. [...] Bird investigated the bird deaths and analysed the bodies, finding small amounts of arsenic. [...] No arsenic was found on the feathers, however, indicating that poisoning was not caused by breathing airborne arsenic, since arsenic in the air would be expected to adhere to the feathers. [...] However, Bird found that large amounts of arsenic were in the birds' drinking water, indicating that this was the route taken by the poison.|$|E

500|$|Rhythm {{games have}} been used for health purposes. For example, {{research}} has found that dancing games dramatically increase energy expenditure over that of traditional video games, and that they <b>burn</b> <b>more</b> calories than walking on a treadmill. Scientists have further suggested that, due to the large amount of time children spend playing video games and watching television, games that involve physical activity could be used to combat obesity. Studies have found that playing Dance Dance Revolution can provide an aerobic workout, in terms of a sufficiently intense heart rate, but not the minimum levels of VO2 max. Based on successful preliminary studies, West Virginia, which {{has one of the highest}} rates of obesity and its attendant diseases in the US, introduced Dance Dance Revolution into its schools' physical education classes. According to The New York Times, more than [...] "several hundred schools in at least 10 states" [...] have used Dance Dance Revolution (along with In the Groove) in their curricula. Plans have been made to increase the number into the thousands in an effort to mitigate the country's obesity epidemic. Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Governor of California, was a noted proponent of the game's use in schools. In Japan, celebrities reported losing weight after playing Dance Dance Revolution, which drove sales of the game's home console version. Bemani's testers also found themselves losing weight while working on the game. There is further anecdotal evidence that these games aid weight loss, though the University of Michigan Health System has cautioned that dance games and other exergames should only be a starting point towards traditional sports, which are more effective. Dance games have also been used in rehabilitation and fall-prevention programs for elderly patients, using customised, slower versions of existing games and mats. Researchers have further experimented with prototypes of games allowing wider and more realistic stepping than the tapping actions found in commercial dance games.|$|E
