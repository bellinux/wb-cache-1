The effects of the positions of the UV lamps, light intensity, and ventilation rates on the microorganism removal efficiency were examined by this study. The UV light intensity in the air flow domain was obtained with the modified P- 1 model. Numerical results showed that the airflow could be very complicated in the room. Two different arrangements of the UV lamps were consid-ered and the microorganism removal efficiency with the UV devices set on the wall was shown to be higher than that set {{in the corner of the}} room. The microorganism removal efficiency was shown to increase with an increase in the light intensity. Ventilation could enhance the microorganism removal efficiency, but would reduce the disinfection efficiency...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of Khon Kaen WSP {{revealed that the}} WSP was more appropriate to the Thai regional cities' situation in both sewage treatment objective and socio-economic context. The WSP was capable of treating raw sewage meeting Thailand's effluent standard in BOD, pH, total coliform and faecal coliform counts, except TSS. Sunlight, temperature, pH, phosphate, nitrate, retention time, pond geometry, pond location towards the wind direction and removal of algal mats appeared to be major factors influencing the <b>biological</b> <b>pollutant</b> degradation activities inside the ponds. Offensive odour, as a main public complaint about the plant, resulted from the abundance of floating algal mats. Some conventional WSP design equations {{were found to be}} less effective in effluent quality prediction compared with the actual pond performance. The result of the analysis of some of the contemporarily designed BOD loading equations applied to this plant showed that such equations were less appropriate to the Khon Kaen city environment. The actual BOD loading-removal linear equation investigated from this existing plant could be the best method for future WSP development in this region. The plant, with low costs of construction, operation and maintenance, was found to be cost-effective and suited to Khon Kaen city conditions. The plant required more operators and the present workers need additional training and experiences. Supplying the operators with equipment for removing algal mats appeared to reduce offensive odours and increased pond performance. Due to TSS level in the final discharge being over the country's standard, initiating any measure for decreasing TSS would be necessary for this plant...|$|E
40|$|Toxic heavy metals, such as Pb(2 +), {{have become}} {{important}} {{targets for the}} development of efficient receptors that are capable of recognizing their presence as environmental and biological pollutants, and an important part of that receptor-metal characterization process is the provision of spectral evidence that identifies the presence of a metal ion. From results reported here on a combined experimental and theoretical study it is shown that, when complexed with aromatic ligands, Pb(2 +) is capable of yielding structured UV spectra, which: (i) exhibit discrete electronic transitions that include significant contributions from the metal ion; (ii) are very sensitive to the electronic properties of coordinating ligands; and (iii) are sensitive to subtle changes in coordination geometry. Two aromatic sandwich complexes, [Pb(benzene) 2](2 +) and [Pb(toluene) 2](2 +) have been prepared in the gas phase and their UV action spectra recorded from ions held and cooled in an ion trap. Whilst [Pb(benzene) 2](2 +) exhibits a spectrum with very little detail, that recorded for [Pb(toluene) 2](2 +) reveals a rich structure in the wavelength range 220 - 280 nm. Theory in the form of density functional theory (DFT) shows that both types of complex take the form of hemidirected structures, and that [Pb(toluene) 2](2 +) can adopt three distinct conformers depending upon the relative positions of the two methyl groups. Further calculations, using adiabatic time-dependent DFT to assign electronic transitions, provide evidence of individual [Pb(toluene) 2](2 +) conformers having been resolved in the experimental spectrum. Of particular significance {{for the development of}} methods for identifying Pb(2 +) as an environmental or <b>biological</b> <b>pollutant,</b> is the observation that there are distinct ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions in the UV that are sensitive to both the geometry and the electronic characteristics of molecules that accommodate the metal ion...|$|E

However, recommendations regarding water treatment for oocyst inactivation have not been established. As part of this doctoral thesis, the efficacies of two commonly used chemicals, sodium hypochlorite and ozone, {{as well as physical}} methods of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and radiofrequency (RF) power were evaluated for their ability to inactivate T. gondii oocysts in water. With chemical treatments, oocysts were exposed to either 100 mg/L of chlorine for 30 min, 2 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr, 16 hr, and 24 hr or 6 mg/L of ozone for 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 min. Oocysts were exposed to pulsed and continuous UV exposure doses ranging from 20 to 1000 ml/cm 2 and to various RF energy levels to induce 50, 55, 60, 70 and 80 °C temperatures. Post-treatment, oocyst viability was determined by mouse bioassay with serology, immunohistochemistry, and in vitro parasite isolation as the test methods to confirm T. gondii infection in mice. Initially, mouse bioassay experiments were conducted to compare the analytical sensitivity of these 3 detection methods prior to completing the chemical inactivation experiments. Toxoplasma gondii infection was confirmed by at least 1 of the 3 detection methods in mice inoculated with all doses (105 - 10 °) of oocysts. Results of the chemical exposure experiments indicated that neither sodium hypochlorite nor ozone effectively inactivated T. gondii oocysts, even when used at high concentrations. Both pulsed and continuous UV irradiation results indicated that some T. gondii oocysts were inactivated when exposed to UV radiation, but not with 100 % efficiency over the entire range of UV doses evaluated. Oocysts were inactivated with RF-induced thermal levels of > 60 °C in an initial experiment, but not in subsequent experiments conducted under similar conditions. These results indicated that UV treatment may be useful to sanitize drinking water and sewage effluent but the impact of factors such as water heating time, cooling time, and the volume of water treated must be considered when evaluating any method for oocyst inactivation...|$|E

30|$|The <b>biological</b> <b>pollutants</b> in the {{groundwater}} samples {{in the study}} area were discussed through the measurements of nitrate compounds and phosphate content (Table  8). The excess usage of inorganic fertilizers containing nitrogen is the main source of nitrate soluble in water, which results in a high availability for plants. About 30 % of these salts are absorbed by plants and the rest go into solution with drainage water. Consequently, nitrate ion can easily reach {{the groundwater}} through the soil from nitrogen fertilizers because adsorption to the soil is very low (Menció et al. 2016). The results of the biological analyses indicated that the concentrations of nitrate ions in some groundwater samples are greater than the acceptable limit.

Experimental cultivation shows the growth of target bacteria inside the alginate hydrogel microfiber during exposure to invading bacteria. The membrane thickness of the microfiber greatly affects the bacterial growth due to changes in membrane permeability.

Actually, populations in developed countries spend more than 80 % of their time in confined indoor environments. Indoor air pollutants emanate from various sources, chemical or biological. Most of the studies deal with the removal of chemical sources but biological treatment of indoor air remains an emerging research theme. Indeed, the removal of biological agents is a complex issue. None of the traditional technologies for indoor air decontamination, such as activated charcoal filters, HEPA filters with or without UV radiation, ozonation, air ionization, are completely effective. Moreover, these technologies still need further investigation. The aim is not only to trap the microorganisms present in the indoor air, but also to alter them irreversibly. In this context, the combination, within air treatment plants, of both the photocatalytic and the filtering process is a promising technology that would combine the benefits of both processes to efficiently trap and alter chemical and microbiological pollutants through total mineralisation. Our researches deals with the effects of UV-A and UV-C radiation on the coating of aerosolised cells of fungal spores before and after their germination but also on an experimental bioaerosol of bacteria in presence of photocatalytic and non-photocatalytic air filters commonly used in Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. E. coli and Aspergillus Niger are used as model of bacteria and fungi because E. coli is commonly used to evaluate indoor air cleaning technologies and A. Niger is known for its resistance to any environmental stress conditions, and especially the spores which contain a black fungal spore pigment, protecting them from UV radiation exposure. In presence of E. coli or A. Niger the photocatalytic filters without charcoal demonstrated better disinfection efficiency with full damages of the cells, probably resulting from an optimal contact between TiO 2 coating and the microorganisms. In contrast, the use of filters with activated charcoal, even with UV-C, resulted in the apparition of an inactivation threshold that could be attributed to the penetration of cells within the activated charcoal layer and the absence of contact with the photocatalyst. However, UV-C photocatalysis was able to inactivate faster and, at the same time, mineralise <b>biological</b> <b>pollutants</b> than UV-A. In the case of A. Niger, the effects of UV radiation were also assessed on spore germination for both types of filters. The inactivation of spores in illuminated photocatalytic filters resulted in an irreversible inhibition of the fungal germination under UV-A or UV-C radiation. In contrast, fungal spores were able to germinate in non-photocatalytic filters despite previous exposure to both types of UV radiation. After spore germination disinfection efficiency is lower than experiments whereby spores had just been applied onto the filters, due to the absence of contact between the <b>biological</b> <b>pollutants</b> and the photocatalyst coating. Our results demonstrated the interest to use photocatalytic filters ensuring optimal contact between pollutants and TiO 2 coating to lead to a total inactivation of fungal spores in filters of HVAC systems...|$|R
