40|$|ANIMMA Conference, Lisbon, PORTUGAL, 2015 International audienceThe nuclear {{radiation}} energy deposition rate (unit usually employed: W. g(- 1)) {{is a key}} parameter for the thermal design of experiments on materials and nuclear fuel carried out in experimental channels of <b>irradiation</b> <b>reactors,</b> such as the French reactor in Saclay called OSIRIS or the Polish reactor named MARIA. In particular the quantification of nuclear heating allows the prediction of heat and thermal conditions induced in irradiated devices and/or structural materials. Various sensors are used to quantify this parameter, in particular radiometric calorimeters, also known as in-pile calorimeters. Two main kinds of in-pile calorimeter exist possessing two geometries and two measurement principles: the single-cell calorimeter and the differential calorimeter. The present work focuses on specific examples of these calorimeter types, from the step of their out-of-pile calibration (transient and steady experiments respectively) to the comparison between numerical and experimental results obtained from two irradiation campaigns (French and Polish reactors). The main aim {{of this paper is}} to propose a steady numerical approach to estimate the single-cell calorimeter response under irradiation conditions...|$|R

40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} {{process for}} the detoxification of carbon tetrachloride- (CCl{sub 4 }{sup {minus}}) contaminated soil was investigated in the laboratory by using a batch <b>irradiation</b> <b>reactor</b> equipped with a 600 -W ultrasonic power supply operated at a frequency of 20 kHz. Key parameters studied included soil characteristics, irradiation time, CCl{sub 4 } concentration, steady-state operating temperature, applied ultrasonic-wave energy, and the ratio of soil to water in the system. The results of the experiments showed that (1) residual CCl{sub 4 } concentrations could be decreased with longer irradiation periods and (2) detoxification efficiency was proportional to steady-state operating temperature and applied ultrasonic-wave energy. The characteristics of the contaminated soil {{were found to be}} an important factor in the design of an ultrasonic detoxification system. A soil-phase CCl{sub 4 } concentration below 1 ppm (initial concentration of 56 ppm) was achieved through this process, indicating that the application of ultrasonic irradiation is feasible and effective in the detoxification of soil contaminated by organic compounds. On the basis of the experimental results, a schematic of a full-scale ultrasonic soil-detoxification system was developed. Improvements to this novel process are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The neutron {{temperature}} is a characteristic parameter in <b>irradiation</b> channels of <b>reactor.</b> For nuclides which have resonances in the thermal neutron energy range, their Westcott g-factors {{are different from}} unity. The values of g-factors and cross-sections of (n, c) reaction of these nuclides are temperature dependence. The standard energy for tabulation of thermal neutron cross-section (r 0) is that of room temperature (293. 59 K or 20. 43 C), cor-responding to a neutron energy 0. 0253 eV or to a neutron velocity of 2200 m/s. However, in the <b>irradiation</b> channels of <b>reactor,</b> the temperature is not exact at 20. 43 C. Thus, the temperature at the irradiation position must be known to convert r 0 to r(T).

40|$|A {{scalable}} {{method for}} {{the synthesis of}} polyethylene terephthalamide microcapsules grafted with polyacrylic acid to enable pH responsiveness has been developed. Microcapsules were produced by interfacial polymerisation of an oil-in-water emulsion in a 2 L batch reactor and subsequently circulated through an external loop reactor for UV irradiative surface grafting. Ungrafted microcapsule samples yielded 1. 0 - 1. 2 g desiccated capsules per experiment. Initial production trials were subject to severe agglomeration, observed during dialysis of the microcapsules with 30 % (v/v) ethanol solution. Lowering of the terephthaloyl dichloride monomer concentration, to 0. 2 mol L⁻¹ in the chloroform / cyclohexane (3 : 1) organic solution, alleviated this unwanted agglomeration. Laser diffraction particle size analysis revealed microcapsules were produced with a 51 µm average diameter. A purpose built external loop <b>irradiation</b> <b>reactor</b> was used to facilitate graft polymerisation of acrylic acid on the microcapsules, using 254 nm UV light at 19 mW cm⁻². Characterisation of the external loop flow regime showed a mild deviation from ideal plug flow, with a vessel dispersion number of 0. 014 and a Reynolds number of 1310. Confirmation of monomer polymerisation was ascertained by back titration and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. No distinction between homopolymer and grafted polyacrylic acid could be made by these characterisation methods. A Taguchi analysis on variables influencing grafting revealed high temperature to contribute most significantly to graft yield, followed by a long irradiation period. The development of a packed column pulse response method for testing pH response showed a high repeatability. However, release profile testing of a microcapsule slurry with an observed graft yield of 1. 13 mmol g⁻¹ did not provide a definitive pH-based release of mPEG 5000 or PEGylated TAMRA dye. Determination of acrylic acid polymerisation kinetics following UV irradiation of the microcapsules is required for future optimisation of a functional graft yield...|$|R
