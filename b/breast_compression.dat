40|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} to simulate large <b>breast</b> <b>compressions</b> such as those occurring during x-ray mammography. However, the evaluation of these methods against real data is rare. The {{aim of this study}} is to learn more about the deformation behavior of breasts and to assess a simulation method. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of 11 breasts before and after applying a relatively large in vivo compression in the medial direction were acquired. Nonrigid registration was employed to study the deformation behavior. Optimal material properties for finite element modeling were determined and their prediction performance was assessed. The realism of simulated compressions was evaluated by comparing the breast shapes on simulated and real mammograms. Following image registration, 19 <b>breast</b> <b>compressions</b> from 8 women were studied. An anisotropic deformation behavior, with a reduced elongation in the anterior-posterior direction and an increased stretch in the inferior-superior direction was observed. Using finite element simulations, the performance of isotropic and transverse isotropic material models to predict the displacement of internal landmarks was compared. Isotropic materials reduced the mean displacement error of the landmarks from 23. 3 to 4. 7 mm, on average, after optimizing material properties with respect to breast surface alignment and image similarity. Statistically significantly smaller errors were achieved with transverse isotropic materials (4. 1 mm, P= 0. 0045). Homogeneous material models performed substantially worse (transverse isotropic: 5. 5 mm; isotropic: 6. 7 mm). Of the parameters varied, the amount of anisotropy had the greatest influence on the results. Optimal material properties varied less when grouped by patient rather than by compression magnitude (mean: 0. 72 vs. 1. 44). Employing these optimal materials for simulating mammograms from ten MR breast images of a different cohort resulted in more realistic breast shapes than when using established material models. Breasts in the prone position exhibited an anisotropic compression behavior. Transverse isotropic materials with an increased stiffness in the anterior-posterior direction improved the prediction of these deformations and produced more realistic mammogram simulations from MR images...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{accuracy}} of two methods of determining the contact area between the compression paddle and the breast in mammography. An accurate method to determine the contact area is essential to accurately calculate the average compression pressure applied by the paddle. Methods: For a set of 300 <b>breast</b> <b>compressions,</b> we measured the contact areas between breast and paddle, both capacitively using a transparent foil with indium-tin-oxide (ITO) coating attached to the paddle, and retrospectively from the obtained mammograms using image processing software (Volpara Enterprise, algorithm version 1. 5. 2). A gold standard was obtained from video images of the compressed <b>breast.</b> During each <b>compression,</b> the <b>breast</b> was illuminated from the sides {{in order to create}} a dark shadow on the video image where the breast was in contact with the compression paddle. We manually segmented the shadows captured at the time of x-ray exposure and measured their areas. Results: We found a strong correlation between the manual segmentations and the capacitive measurements [r = 0. 989, 95 % CI (0. 987, 0. 992) ] and between the manual segmentations and the image processing software [r = 0. 978, 95 % CI (0. 972, 0. 982) ]. Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias of - 0. 0038 dm(2) for the capacitive measurement (SD 0. 0658, 95 % limits of agreement [- 0. 1329, 0. 1252]) and - 0. 0035 dm(2) for the image processing software [SD 0. 0962, 95 % limits of agreement (- 0. 1921, 0. 1850) ]. Conclusions: The size of the contact area between the paddle and the breast can be determined accurately and precisely, both in real-time using the capacitive method, and retrospectively using image processing software.

30|$|According to Whelehan et al. [44], clients avoid re-attending for {{screening}} mammography due to breast pain {{experienced in the}} previous exams. During a mammography exam, pain can arise from the application of compression force, being also a challenge in the radiographer practice, as the radiographer rather than the client influences the application of compression force in mammography. The application of compression force and the resultant pain can affect client experience, radiation dose and image quality (noise, sharpness, movement artefacts), {{and needs to be}} addressed in radiographer education and training.

Methods and Materials: The standard projections were simulated [craniocaudal/(CC) and mediolateral-oblique/(MLO) ] with the two breast compressions in 90 volunteers women aged between 19 and 86. The women were organised in groups according to the breast density. The intensity of discomfort was evaluated using the scale that have represented several faces (0 - 10) proposed by Wong Baker {{in the end of}} each simulation. It was also applied an interview using focus group to debate the score that were attributed during pain evaluation and to identify the criteria that were considered to do the classification. Results: The women aged between 19 - 29 y (with higher breast density) classified the pain during no gradual compression as 4 and the gradual compression as 2 for both projections. The MLO projection was considered the most uncomfortable. During the focus group interview applied to this group was highlighted that compression did not promoted pain but discomfort. They considered that the high expectations of pain did not correspond to the discomfort that they felt. Similar results were identified for the older women (30 - 50 y; > 50 y).

40|$|Rationale: Mammography {{practitioners}} {{control the}} amount of compression force applied to the breast. There are no quantifiable recommendations for optimal compression force levels for practitioners to follow. Clients report variations in pain and discomfort when compression force is applied. Until now practitioner compression force variability has not been investigated; even though this might lead to variations in client pain and discomfort. The primary purpose of this thesis was to investigate whether practitioner compression force variability exists. Method: Three research papers investigated practitioner compression force variability: one used a cross sectional design; two used longitudinal designs, one was single centre {{and the other was}} multicentre. Three further research papers investigated important issues which might confound practitioner variability results: the first investigated compression paddle bend and distortion; the second investigated how <b>breast</b> thickness and <b>compression</b> force vary; the third evaluated practitioner ability to grade breast density, visually. The final research paper was a ‘within client’ investigation to determine how image quality varied with <b>breast</b> thickness and <b>compression</b> force.

40|$|Background: In mammography, <b>breast</b> <b>compression</b> {{is applied}} to reduce the {{thickness}} of the breast. While it is widely accepted that firm <b>breast</b> <b>compression</b> is needed to ensure acceptable image quality, guidelines remain vague about how much compression should be applied during mammogram acquisition. A quantitative parameter indicating the desirable amount of compression is not available. Consequently, {{little is known about the}} relationship between the amount of <b>breast</b> <b>compression</b> and breast cancer detectability. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of <b>breast</b> <b>compression</b> pressure in mammography on breast cancer screening outcomes. Methods: We used digital image analysis methods to determine breast volume, percent dense volume, and pressure from 132, 776 examinations of 57, 179 women participating in the Dutch population-based biennial breast cancer screening program. Pressure was estimated by dividing the compression force by the area of the contact surface between breast and compression paddle. The data was subdivided into quintiles of pressure and the number of screen-detected cancers, interval cancers, false positives, and true negatives were determined for each group. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for correlation between examinations of the same woman and for the effect of breast density and volume when estimating sensitivity, specificity, and other performance measures. Sensitivity was computed using interval cancers occurring between two screening rounds and using interval cancers within 12 months after screening. Pair-wise testing for significant differences was performed. Results: Percent dense volume increased with increasing pressure, while breast volume decreased. Sensitivity in quintiles with increasing pressure was 82. 0 %, 77. 1 %, 79. 8 %, 71. 1 %, and 70. 8 %. Sensitivity based on interval cancers within 12 months was significantly lower in the highest pressure quintile compared to the third (84. 3 % vs 93. 9 %, p[*]=[*] 0. 034). Specificity was lower in the lowest pressure quintile (98. 0 %) compared to the second, third, and fourth group (98. 5 %, p[*]<[*] 0. 005). Specificity of the fifth quintile was 98. 4 %.

Since bottle-feeding infants have lower oxygen saturation, vacuum levels, and different suck-swallow-breathe (SSwB) coordination to breastfeeding infants, we hypothesised that when infants fed from a teat that required a vacuum threshold of − 29 [*]mmHg for milk removal, that oxygen saturation, heart rate, and suck-swallow-breathe (SSwB) patterns would be similar to those of breastfeeding. Study Design. Infants (= 16) were monitored during one breastfeed and one feed from the experimental teat. Simultaneous recordings were made of oxygen saturation, heart rate, vacuum, tongue movement, respiration, and swallowing. Results. There were no differences in oxygen saturation and heart rate between the breast and the teat. Infants displayed fewer sucks and breaths per swallow during nutritive sucking (NS) compared to non-nutritive sucking (NNS). The number of sucks per breath was similar for NS and NNS although respiratory rates were slower during NS. These patterns did not differ between the breast and the teat. Conclusion.
