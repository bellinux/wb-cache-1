5|$|LTP can {{be induced}} either by strong tetanic {{stimulation}} {{of a single}} pathway to a synapse, or cooperatively via the weaker stimulation of many. When one pathway into a synapse is stimulated weakly, it produces insufficient postsynaptic depolarization to induce LTP. In contrast, when weak stimuli are applied to many pathways that converge on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane, the individual postsynaptic depolarizations generated may collectively depolarize the postsynaptic cell enough to induce LTP cooperatively. Synaptic tagging, discussed later, may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> mechanism underlying associativity and cooperativity. Bruce McNaughton argues that any difference between associativity and cooperativity is strictly semantic.|$|E

5|$|The 1984 series {{began with}} Andy Lloyd being {{hit on the}} head, {{resulting}} in his being hospitalised. This would prove to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> theme throughout the series, as the English batsmen struggled {{to cope with the}} West Indies bouncers. Whenever England threatened, a West Indian player would step up and take control of the match, as when Gordon Greenidge scored 214 after an England declaration to win the second Test. The series was decided at Leeds, where the West Indies gained an unassailable 3–0 lead. The final Test at The Oval saw the West Indies record the only whitewash by a visiting nation in a five Test series. This was the fifth whitewash in Test cricket and the first to be inflicted on England in England.|$|E
5|$|The {{female worker}} ants {{do not have}} wings and {{reproductive}} females lose their wings after their mating flights in order to begin their colonies. Therefore, unlike their wasp ancestors, most ants travel by walking. Some species are capable of leaping. For example, Jerdon's jumping ant (Harpegnathos saltator) is able to jump by synchronising the action of its mid and hind pairs of legs. There are several species of gliding ant including Cephalotes atratus; this may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> trait among most arboreal ants. Ants with this ability are {{able to control the}} direction of their descent while falling.|$|E
5|$|The undifferenced {{arms of the}} Kingdom were {{eventually}} granted to Essex County Council in 1932. Seaxes were also used in the insignia {{of many of the}} boroughs and urban districts in the county, while the Saxon crown came to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> heraldic charge in English civic arms. On the creation of the Greater London Council in 1965 a Saxon crown was introduced in its coat of arms. Seaxes appear in the arms of several London borough councils and of Spelthorne Borough Council, whose area was in Middlesex.|$|E

5|$|There {{were also}} {{issues with the}} {{promotion}} of the film: promotional material in the form of teaser posters created by Bob Peak, based on the Licence Revoked title and commissioned by Albert Broccoli, had been produced, but MGM decided against using them after American test screenings showed 'Licence Revoked' to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> American phrase for the withdrawal of a driving licence. The delayed, corrected advertising by Steven Chorney, in the traditional style, limited the film's pre-release screenings. MGM also discarded a campaign created by advertising executive Don Smolen – who had worked in the publicity campaign for eight Bond films before – emphasising the rougher content of the movie.|$|E
5|$|These repressive {{measures}} included taking prominent Serbs hostage against Serb attacks. To {{avoid being}} {{taken as a}} hostage, Stojanović paid 100,000 dinars to the Ustaše in Prijedor. Resistance began to emerge in occupied Yugoslavia; royalists and Serbian nationalists {{under the leadership of}} then-Colonel Draža Mihailović founded the Ravna Gora Movement, whose members were called Chetniks. The KPJ, led by Josip Broz Tito, prepared to rise to arms at a favourable moment. In the view of the KPJ, the fight against the Axis and its domestic collaborators would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> fight of all Yugoslav peoples.|$|E
5|$|In his foreword, Kwee {{wrote that}} Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang was {{intended}} to lead readers to consider how fate is often {{at odds with the}} wants of those involved. Critical readings have, however, been diverse. The sinologist Myra Sidharta notes that the book is replete with mysticism common at the time, as does another sinologist, John Kwee. The latter cites four examples: a dream of Marsiti's, later shown to be prophetic, in which she is forcibly separated from Aij Tjeng despite his previous promise that they would never part; a discussion of reuniting with loved ones after death; Marsiti's spirit attending her daughter's wedding; and a scene {{towards the end of the}} novel in which Marsiti's spirit guides Roosminah's daughter to pick flowers for Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio. Nio Joe Lan, in his history of Chinese Malay literature, notes that Kwee was the only Chinese writer of romances to also write on Eastern (particularly Chinese) philosophy. He finds mysticism to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> theme in Kwee's works, noting it as particularly well-developed in the later novel Soemangetnja Boenga Tjempaka (The Joy of the Cempaka Flowers).|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, around the {{coronation}} of Edward VII, a discussion started {{on the need for}} a heraldic symbol that was representative of the Indian empire. William Coldstream, a British member of the Indian Civil Service, campaigned the government to change the heraldic symbol from a star, which he considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> choice, to something more appropriate. His proposal was not well received by the government; Lord Curzon rejected it for practical reasons including the multiplication of flags. Around this time, nationalist opinion within the dominion was leading to a representation through religious tradition. The symbols that were in vogue included the Ganesha, advocated by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Kali, advocated by Aurobindo Ghosh and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. Another symbol was the cow, or Gau Mata (cow mother). However, all these symbols were Hindu-centric and did not suggest unity with India's Muslim population.|$|E
5|$|One type of {{sympatric}} speciation involves crossbreeding of two related species {{to produce a}} new hybrid species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during meiosis the homologous chromosomes from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair. However, it {{is more common in}} plants because plants often double their number of chromosomes, to form polyploids. This allows the chromosomes from each parental species to form matching pairs during meiosis, since each parent's chromosomes are represented by a pair already. An example of such a speciation event is when the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa crossbred to give the new species Arabidopsis suecica. This happened about 20,000 years ago, and the speciation process has been repeated in the laboratory, which allows the study of the genetic mechanisms involved in this process. Indeed, chromosome doubling within a species may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> cause of reproductive isolation, as half the doubled chromosomes will be unmatched when breeding with undoubled organisms.|$|E
5|$|When Joan {{comes to}} speak with Charles, the Dauphin pretends to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> member of the court while someone else pretends to be him. Joan is able {{to see through the}} ruse and {{immediately}} proclaims that she is sent to restore the French crown to him at Rheims. Charles has her examined by priests and scholars to determine that she is free of black magic. While questioned, Joan describes how God came to her with visions and describes her faith in a similar manner to deism. This causes the examiners to believe that she is a heretic until a blue flame appears along with a sound, which is enough to silence any doubts about her faith. The flame reveals a suit of armour for her, but one individual interrupts her immediate donning of the armour to claim that France is cursed and that she would be a victim. The individual, as it turns out, is Conrade, who blames himself that Joan left her peaceful life to help a French court that was corrupt. He also warns her that he experienced a vision of her burning at the stake.|$|E

25|$|The Conciliation and Arbitration Act {{provided}} at s 38(f) that the Arbitration Court could declare an award to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> rule of any industry. The other constitutional argument {{was that the}} Australian parliament had no power to provide for common rule awards. There were two impediments to this argument (1) the award had not at that time been declared to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> rule award and (2) The boot manufacturers who applied to the High Court were all {{parties to the dispute}} and thus would be bound by the Award regardless. As Higgins had noted, the High Court will not answer a constitutional question unless it is necessary. The State of Victoria had intervened in the case to protect the public of that State from the operation of what it said was an invalid federal law. The argument was that the common rule provisions were invalid and could not be severed from the balance of the Act, such that the entire Act was invalid.|$|E
