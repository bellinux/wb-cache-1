40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutant}} (POP) bioaccumulation {{models have been}} generally formulated to predict two main processes, bioconcentration and biomagnification. A third bioaccumulation process that can mediate chemical potential in an organism is <b>bioamplification.</b> <b>Bioamplification</b> occurs when an organism loses body weight and chemical partitioning capacity faster than it can eliminate contaminants. <b>Bioamplification</b> causes an increase in chemical fugacity in the animal 2 ̆ 7 s tissues and results in the redistribution of contaminants from inert storage sites to more toxicologically sensitive tissues. Further, <b>bioamplification</b> generally occurs when an organism experiences major bioenergetic bottlenecks or nutritional stress, frequently associated with critical periods in the animal 2 ̆ 7 s life history. The goal of this dissertation was to characterize <b>bioamplification</b> as a general bioaccumulation process that is additive to bioconcentration and biomagnification mechanisms of chemical exposure. Empirical studies validating <b>bioamplification</b> in three different animal models each undergoing a recognizable bioenergetic bottleneck during their life history were completed. Specifically, <b>bioamplification</b> was validated in emergent aquatic insects, fish embryos during egg development and larval fish. <b>Bioamplification</b> factors in the above studies ranged from 1. 9 - 2. 1 in emergent male mayflies, 1. 8 - 5. 4 in incubating yellow perch embryos and 1. 5 - 5. 3 in larval Chinook salmon (dependent on food resource availability). To complement these studies, a literature review was completed to demonstrate the wide applicability of this concept to different animal species. Examples of <b>bioamplification</b> were presented in invertebrates, fishes, birds and mammals corresponding to bioenergetic bottlenecks related to migration, reproduction, early life stages, metamorphosis, over wintering weight losses and disease. <b>Bioamplification</b> factors summarized in the literature ranged from 1. 1 - 14 and were similar in magnitude to biomagnification factors typically reported for aquatic and terrestrial organisms. While most of the descriptions of <b>bioamplification</b> in the literature have treated it as a bioaccumulation curiosity, {{the results of this}} dissertation demonstrate that <b>bioamplification</b> is a general bioaccumulation process that contributes to enhanced chemical fugacities of POPs across the animal kingdom. Further, the results of this dissertation showed that <b>bioamplification</b> is producing maximum POP fugacities at critical periods over the animal 2 ̆ 7 s life history and as such the consequences of <b>bioamplification</b> may be very important to wildlife hazard and risk assessments...|$|E
40|$|Fall {{spawning}} {{pacific salmon}} provision {{large amounts of}} yolk to their eggs to allow survival of larvae during under the ice winter conditions. This yolk provisioning leads to maternal offloading of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to eggs and larvae. Previous {{research has shown that}} Chinook salmon larvae exhibit limited capacity to eliminate POPs during the cold water period resulting in <b>bioamplification</b> of POP residues. This study compared POPs <b>bioamplification</b> in Chinook salmon larvae under a high food provisioning treatment and a non-fed treatment to test whether or not food availability attenuates POPs <b>bioamplification</b> via growth dilution. Results demonstrate that larvae in the food provisioning treatment did not gain weight until after day 129. Between hatching and day 129, fed and non-fed treatments exhibited similar decreases in whole body lipid content, negligible POPs elimination and POPs <b>bioamplification</b> factors approaching 1. 6. By day 184 of the study, POPs <b>bioamplification</b> factors in the non-fed treatment were as high as 5. 3 across chemicals but ranged from non-detectable to approaching 1 in the fed group. This study demonstrates that POPs <b>bioamplification</b> occurs in Chinook salmon larvae even under ideal rearing conditions but peaks after day 129, following which growth dilution can attenuate <b>bioamplification</b> relative to starved individuals.

40|$|Ephemeral {{emergent}} insects, such as mayflies (Hexagenia spp.), {{are commonly}} used as biomonitors of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and provide a vector for aquatic-terrestrial contaminant transfer. Mayflies bioaccumulate sediment-associated contaminants by bioconcentration and biomagnification during the aquatic stage and concentrate POP residues postemergence due to <b>bioamplification,</b> which {{occurs as a result}} of weight and lipid loss without contaminant loss. The present study quantified polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) <b>bioamplification</b> in male and female emergent mayflies at three sites. Male mayflies used 36 to 68 % of their lipids during emergence, with the exception of caged males that were prevented from flight. Females did not lose lipid content between pre-emergent nymph and emerged life stages. Mass balance indicated no PCB elimination between life stages. The mean PCB <b>bioamplification</b> factor, expressed as the ratio of lipid-equivalent PCB concentrations across life stages, was 2. 05 ± 0. 38 for male imagos/nymphs and 1. 91 ± 0. 18 for male imago/subimago life stages. For females, <b>bioamplification</b> factors were close to unity. Wildlife consumers of imago stages of emergent mayflies can potentially increase their total daily intake of PCBs by 36 % depending on the sex-ratio composition of their diet relative to animals that feed predominantly on nymph or subimago stages during mass emergence events. © 2011 SETAC...|$|E
40|$|The {{maternal}} provisioning of yolk to eggs transfers significant {{quantities of}} {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs). As yolk utilization progresses via metabolic activity, {{there is a potential}} to realize further increases in POP concentrations if yolk lipids are depleted at a faster rate than POPs, a condition referred to as <b>bioamplification.</b> This study investigated the <b>bioamplification</b> of POPs in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) eggs and larvae. Chinook eggs were sampled from the Credit River, ON, Canada, and brought to an aquaculture facility where they were fertilized, incubated, and maintained posthatch until maternally derived lipid reserves became depleted (approximately 168 days). The loss of chemicals having an octanol water partition coefficient (log K-OW) greater than 5. 8 was slow to negligible from days 0 - 135. However, during the increase in water temperatures in early spring, K-OW-dependent elimination of POPs was observed. <b>Bioamplification</b> was maximized for the highest log K-OW POPs, with an approximate 5 -fold increase in lipid equivalents concentrations in 168 day old larvae as compared to newly fertilized eggs. This study demonstrates that later yolk-sac Chinook larvae (before exogenous feeding) are exposed to higher lipid equivalents POP concentrations than predicted by maternal deposition, which could lead to underestimates in the toxicity of critical life stages...|$|E

Particular {{attention was paid to}} possible temporal and spatial variations in Hg levels. The results of two sampling campaigns corresponding to the rainy season (April-May/ 2000) and rising water season (January/ 2001) are presented. <b>Bioamplification</b> of Hg through the trophic chains of the three lakes was observed. During the rainy season, Hg concentrations in 31 % of predator fish were above the critical value of 500 ng/g, compared to only 28 % in the rising water period. Linear or curvilinear positive correlations between Hg concentrations of muscular tissue and the total length of fish were rarely observed. Various species of commercial importance did not show any variation in Hg concentrations with increasing length of fish. Linear-negative and non-linear positive or negative correlations with Hg throughout the development of fish were also observed. Our data suggest that Hg concentrations may vary seasonally. On the other hand, no spatial variation in Hg concentrations was observed for most of the studied species over the two seasons. These findings suggest {{that it is important to}} consider the different patterns of Hg accumulation as well as the spatial-temporal variations of Hg levels in fish, when implementing measures to inform the populations at risk of Hg exposure...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} <b>bioamplification</b> of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in yellow perch (Perca flavescens) eggs resulting from nutrient utilization by developing embryos during incubation. Newly fertilized eggs containing trace levels of PCBs via maternal deposition {{were collected from}} an aquaculture pond in which adult broodstock had been reared over their natural lives. The eggs were incubated using a flow through system that received the same pond water at in-situ temperatures from which they were spawned. Replicate samples of eggs were collected at six time points throughout incubation, ranging from day 0 (newly fertilized eggs) to post-hatch larvae (2 -d old). Congener specific PCB fugacities in pooled egg samples showed increases over the incubation period. Just prior to hatching, incubated eggs averaged 2. 7 -fold higher PCB fugacities compared to fresh eggs. The increase in PCB fugacity with egg incubation time was independent of chemical KOW. After hatching, PCB residues were lost from the larvae, attenuating the maximum chemical fugacity achieved in late-incubated eggs. However, the rate of PCB elimination in the early larvae stages was KOW dependent such that a significant larvae/egg fugacity ratio was still evident for intermediate and highly hydrophobic compounds 2 d post-hatching. This study provides the first evidence of in-ovo PCB <b>bioamplification</b> in eggs of an aquatic species and suggests that incubating fish embryos are exposed to higher chemical fugacities in-ovo than would be predicted by maternal deposition alone. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The phenomenon of bioaccumulation and <b>bioamplification</b> (especially of mercury) was investigated by comparing farmed fish with wild specimens of the same species.

40|$|Marine top predators {{are highly}} {{informative}} {{in understanding the}} quality and health of ocean habitats. Through <b>bioamplification,</b> they face a very large risk of exposure to toxic, persistent, and fat-soluble molecules such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), dichlorodimethyltrichloroethane (DDT), and methylmercury, which are preferentially stored in the adipose tissue. The life history of pinnipeds often includes extended periods of fasting on land. This is particularly true for phocid seals such as northern elephant seal (NES) (Mirounga angustirostris). This species indeed exhibits {{one of the most}} extreme terrestrial fasting durations (up to 3 mo) corresponding to breeding, lactation, and molting for females, postweaning development for pups, and maintaining a territory or competing for dominance rank on the breeding rookery for males (Le Boeuf et al. 1972). During such periods, individuals mobilize primarily lipids from their large adipose tissue stores (Costa et al. 1986, Noren et al. 2003). This mobilization of blubber lipids presents a risk through the release of environmental pollutants into the circulation.

40|$|Cadmium(II) is a toxic {{hazardous}} cation, {{whose presence}} in the environment causes great concern because of its bioaccumulation in organisms and <b>bioamplification</b> along food chain.

In this work, the ion exchange of Cd 2 + ions from aqueous solution using microporous titanosilicates (ETS- 4 and ETS- 10) has been modelled using adapted Maxwell-Stefan equations for the ions transport inside the sorbent particles. The fundamentals of the Maxwell-Stefan equations along with correlations for the convective mass transfer coefficients have been used with advantage {{to reduce the number of}} model parameters. In the whole, the model was able to represent successfully the kinetic behaviour of 11 independent and very distinct curves of both studied systems (Cd 2 +/Na+/ETS- 4 and Cd 2 +/Na+/ETS- 10).

40|$|Mercury (Hg) is {{a natural}} and {{widespread}} trace metal occurring in the environment but, at high concentrations in environment, it is considered as a priority hazardous substance because it damages {{the central nervous system}} in severely exposed humans. The case of Hg is quite particular because its <b>bioamplification</b> is different for its different chemical forms. Monoethylmercury (methylmercury) is more easily biomagnified and bioconcentrated than inorganic Hg. The consumption of Hgcontaminated fish is the most common exposure pathway of methylmercury for humans. In aquatic systems, Hg methylation occurs mainly in sediments. Mercury methylation depends on many parameters such as concentrations of sulphide, iron, mercury, organic matter, and, in natural environments, seems {{to be the result of}} sulphate- and iron-reducing bacteria activities (SRB and IRB, respectively). The studies performed to explain methylation investigating only one strain and/or bacteria group revealed that some microorganismgroups were able to methylate Hg as a detoxification process. In general, the studies were based on the cultures, isolation and identification of the strains. Other studies added obligate compounds for one selected metabolic pathway and then the Hg transformation was measured. Finally, added obligate compounds were measured for one selected metabolic pathway (i. e molybdate to inhibit sulphate-reduction) and the bacteria involved in methylation were determined...|$|E

While {{the effects of}} metal(loid) s on vegetation and macrofauna have been widely studied, their impact on microarthropods (millimetre scale) and their bioaccumulation capacity have been less investigated. However, microarthropods provide important ecosystem services, contributing in particular to soil organic matter dynamics. This study focussed {{on the impact of}} metal(loid) pollution on the structure and distribution of microarthropod communities and their potential to bioaccumulate lead (Pb). Soil samples were collected from a contaminated historical site with a strong horizontal and vertical gradient of Pb concentrations. Microarthropods were extracted using the Berlese method. The field experiments showed that microarthropods were present even in extremely polluted soils (30, 000 mg Pb kg− 1). However, while microarthropod abundance increased with increasing soil C/N content (R 2 = 0. 79), richness decreased with increasing pollution. A shift in the community structure from an oribatid-to a springtail-dominated community was observed in less polluted soils (R 2 = 0. 68). In addition, Pb <b>bioamplification</b> occurred in microarthropods, with higher Pb concentrations in predators than in detritivorous microarthropods. Finally, the importance of feeding and reproductive ecological traits as potentially relevant descriptors of springtail community structures was highlighted.

40|$|Heavy metals {{cannot be}} {{degraded}} by microorganism. When being {{released into the}} environment, heavy metals could be accumulated by organisms and underwent a process of <b>bioamplification</b> throughout the food chain and further affect human health. Therefore, {{it is an important}} and emerging remediation issue on how to effectively remove heavy metal pollutants from the environment. However, current studies on the heavy metals polluted farmland remediation have being limited on using physical/chemical methods to remove metals as much as possible. The effects of such treatment on damaging the existing microorganism community have never been concerned. It is not surprising {{that a lot of these}} treated farmlands will never be normally used again. As long as there is a healthy microorganism community, diversity on species and function, treated or untreated farmlands can be used properly. Therefore, the aim of this proposal is to explore the remediation potential and effect of various treatment approaches by measuring the fluctuation of microorganism community and the diversity of functional genes. Both the evolution signature of microorganism (diversity on bacterial diversity) and the bacterial metabolism status (diversity on functional genes) will be measured. By exploring the microorganism communities on the different stages of remediation process, we will be able to quantify the real effects of heavy metal contaminants on farmland. Furthermore, an optimal metal-contaminated farmland remediation strategy could be established with the help of biological views. 重金屬污染物無法被微生物分解，可能藉由生物吸收再經由食物鏈之生物放大作用而對人體健康產生危害。因此，探討如何有效去除環境中重金屬污染物為一項重要且急迫的環境污染整治工作。目前國內在受重金屬污染農地之整治處理上，多僅考慮以物化方法盡可能去除重金屬，而未曾考慮在此類處理過程中對土壤微生物族群所造成的破壞，造成農地地力的嚴重破壞而無法回復正常農業使用的例子時有所聞。惟有保持健康的微生物族群(種類及功能) ，才能在後續農地使用上發揮其正常的作用，因此，本研究提議土壤微生物族群變動及功能性基因多樣性來探討受不同程度重金屬污染農地的復育潛勢及整治影響。分別採用針對微生物基因上演化特徵(常用之微生物多樣性分析技術）以及針對微生物代謝能力表現（新穎之代謝功能性基因多樣性分析技術）的兩類分析方法，針對不同整治階段中土壤微生物的結構及功能性基因異動情形進行分析調查，不僅可以鑑定出劣化農地重金屬污染後微生物族群受影響情形，更可以進一步以微生物觀點協助建立出最佳的整治受重金屬污染農地之復育策略...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of sediments, concerning to pesticides, constitutes {{an important step}} for {{the understanding of the}} principal sources of contamination of the surface water. Hence, {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate for the first time the occurrence, distribution and risk of pesticides in sediments of the Alqueva reservoir, the largest reservoir in the Europe. For this purpose, the occurrence of 22 pesticides and some of their degradation products was determined in surficial sediments of the Alqueva reservoir. To assess the potential risk on ecosystem, the measured concentrations of pesticides were compared with regulatory and toxicological benchmarks. Of the 22 pesticides analysed, only 8 were detected. Diuron was the pesticide detected in greater concentration, followed by terbuthylazine and chlortoluron. The sediments most polluted by pesticides were from Lucefécit, constituted totally by fine particles (< 0. 063 mm) and with high values of organic matter, and are located nearby large agricultural fields. The risk assessment allowed us to conclude that the sediments from the Alqueva reservoir presented low risk, concerning to pesticides, for the various communities that integrate the aquatic ecosystems. However, some of the compounds detected present a high potential for bioaccumulation that may lead to their <b>bioamplification</b> in the trophic chain, reaching concentrations higher than their acceptable daily intake, putting, in this way the populations at risk...|$|E
40|$|Park, {{have been}} {{reported}} to have higher concentrations of toxaphene than other lake trout populations of the Rocky Mountains. Our original hypothesis was that unusually high biomagnification via a long food chain was responsible for elevated levels of toxaphene and other persistent organochlorines in the lake trout. This hypothesis was refuted by the analyses of stable carbon (d 13 C) and nitrogen (d 15 N) isotope ratios in lake biota. Stable nitrogen isotope analyses dem-onstrated that the food chain length in Bow Lake was short. The sources of carbon (pelagic or benthic), as indicated by stable carbon isotope values, were highly correlated with organochlorine concentrations in the food web. Lake trout with more pelagic carbon signatures had higher organochlorine concentrations than littoral-feeding mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni) and lake trout. The pelagic copepod Hesperodiaptomus arcticus had higher organochlorine concentrations (wet weight basis) than any other organism, including the fish. This was attributed to the high lipid con-tent of copepods and possibly their ingestion of suspended solids, including glacial silt or direct absorption from solu-tion in glacial inflows.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between trace metal levels, trophic position and health status {{has been investigated}} in North Sea marine mammals. Stable isotope ratio ( 15 N and  13 C, mass spectrometry) and trace metal analyses (Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Se, Hg, I. C. P Spectrometry and flameless atomic absorption) have been performed in tissues of 52 harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena, 27 harbour seals Phoca vitulina, 9 white-beaked dolphins Lagenorhynchus albirostris, 6 grey seals Halichoerus grypus, 1 hooded seal Cystophora cristata, 2 white-sided dolphin Lagenorhynchus acutus, 7 sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus and 4 fin whales Balaenoptera physalus, found stranded on the Northern French, Belgian and Southern Dutch coasts. The lowest  15 N value has been measured in fin whales, and the highest in white-beaked dolphins, grey and common seals, suggesting a higher trophic position. Sperm whales, white-sided dolphins and hooded seal have strongly negative  13 C values and high renal cadmium levels (258, 88 and 62 µg Cd. g- 1 dw, respectively) indicating that they might feed, at least in part, on oceanic cephalopods. High Hg liver concentrations can be encountered in older animals and reflect a cumulative storage of detoxified HgSe over the whole life span rather than a <b>bioamplification</b> process. Zn, Cu and Hg concentrations were higher in harbour porpoises from the Southern North Sea compared to other areas. Some individuals were severely emaciated as shown by their muscle atrophy and reduced blubber thickness. Hepatic Zn and Se concentrations were significantly higher in emaciated juvenile porpoises than in normal animals suggesting a severe disturbance of the metal homeostasis. To conclude, within the North Sea, trace metal levels in marine mammals display strong intra- and interspecies variations due to geographic origin, age, diet, trophic position but also by nutritional status of the individuals, raising {{the question of the}} suitability of marine mammals as valuable bioindicators of trace metal pollution.

40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} are an increasing threat to shrimp farming industries worldwide and {{account for nearly}} $ 3 billion of annual economic loss. The need to devise novel approaches against these infectious agents is pressing, as traditional methods are insufficient to ward off infections. The main {{aim of this study}} was to apply paratransgenesis to control infectious agents mediating shrimp diseases. As proof-of-concept we showed that Artemia, a food source in shrimp aquaculture, internalized bacteria expressing recombinant proteins. Stable expression and retention of these marker molecules up to 10 hours after feeding with the transgenic bacteria were evident within the gut of Artemia, coincident with the time period of highest density of internalized microorganisms. Uptake of recombinant proteins by Artemia occurred during active feeding, with their rapid depletion during a non-feeding washout phase. <b>Bioamplification</b> of recombinant proteins through increasing trophic levels via the paratransgenic approach was then tested. For this trials were conducted aimed at delivery of recombinant proteins to larval stages of the commercial white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, via direct feeding of transgenic bacteria or via feeding transgenic bacteria-engorged Artemia. In both trials, shrimp extracts showed recombinant protein accumulation during the active feeding phase and decrease during the washout period. From these studies we concluded that transgenic expression of proteins in bacteria can be detected through their paratransgenic expression in Artemia and shrimp, suggesting that this commonly employed feed organism could be applied to target infectious agents in shrimp mariculture. For this purpose we identified cecropin and melittin as effective antimicrobial peptides against vibrio species, and their combination was particularly potent without toxicity toward probiotic bacteria or algal feed organisms. Furthermore, unlike mellitin alone antibiotic resistance did not develop in Vibrio strains exposed to the cecropin/melittin mixture. Finally, the melittin gene was transduced into B. subtilis, and expression of significant levels of melittin was detected, although this was insufficient to cause detectable anti-vibrio activity. Optimization of B. subtilis expression for higher antimicrobial peptide production or employment of algal strains for anti-infectious molecule expression are key future directions for developing a paratransgenic approach as an environmentally sustainable disease mitigation strategy in marine aquaculture.
