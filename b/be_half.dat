If the Austrians succeeded in uniting Hotze's army from the east with Nauendorf's directly north of Zurich, and Archduke Charles' which lay to the north and west, the French would <b>be</b> <b>half</b> encircled at Zurich and dangerously exposed.|$|E
5|$|The Cisalpine Republic, a North Italian {{republic}} {{set up by}} Napoleon in 1797 {{with its}} capital at Milan first adopted a modified form of the metric system based in the braccio cisalpino (Cisalpine cubit) which was defined to <b>be</b> <b>half</b> a metre. In 1802 the Cisalpine Republic was renamed the Italian Republic, with Napoleon as its head of state. The following year the Cisalpine system of measure {{was replaced by the}} metric system.|$|E

5|$|McKinley's good {{standing}} with labor became useful that year as he campaigned for the Republican nomination for Ohio's 17th congressional district. Delegates {{to the county}} conventions thought he could attract blue-collar voters, and in August 1876, McKinley was nominated. By that time, Hayes had been nominated for president, and McKinley campaigned for him while running his own congressional campaign. Both were successful. McKinley, campaigning mostly on his support for a protective tariff, defeated the Democratic nominee, Levi L. Lamborn, by 3,300 votes, while Hayes won a hotly disputed election to reach the presidency. McKinley's victory came at a personal cost: his income as a congressman would <b>be</b> <b>half</b> of what he earned as a lawyer.|$|E
5|$|Overclaiming of aerial {{victories}} was not uncommon, {{and both}} sides claimed more aircraft shot down than was the case. For the 18 August action, British propaganda claimed 144 German aircraft destroyed, which was over twice the actual figure. In response, the Germans claimed they had only lost 36, a figure which has since been proven to <b>be</b> <b>half</b> the actual figure (69 to 71). The German propaganda elements claimed to have destroyed 147 British aircraft, which was over twice the actual figure. Again, the British admitted to losing only 23, when the actual figure was around 68. Other sources between them insist the RAF's losses were 27–34 fighters destroyed, and 29 aircraft destroyed on the ground, including only eight fighters.|$|E
5|$|The Follo Line {{will allow}} the {{capacity}} in the South Corridor from Oslo to increase from about twelve to forty trains per hour. Local and freight trains will use the Østfold Line, while regional and express trains will use the Follo Line. Travel time will be reduced from 22 to 11 minutes. With a new line, there will be 11,000 more public transport trips through the corridor; this includes a 67% increase during rush-hour and 43% {{the rest of the}} day. This allows a reduction of 5,800 car trips per day and reduces carbon dioxide emissions of 5,474 tonnes. Rush hour capacity would be eight trains per hour to Kolbotn, with four continuing to Ski along the old line. The new line would be served by four trains to Moss, two to Mysen and two to Halden. There would <b>be</b> <b>half</b> the frequency during off-peak hours.|$|E

5|$|Conventional {{defensive}} weapons {{included the}} anti-aircraft artillery piece. The three main types were the 4.5-inch, 3.7-inch and 3-inch guns. The first two were modern, and effective over 8000 metres (26,000 feet). The last was a First World War weapon effective only to 4,250 metres (14,000 feet). Usually batteries were sited in fours, with a range-finder and predictor which measured the speeds and heights of enemy aircraft while {{taking into account}} the time shell took to reach their intended targets, thus calculating when to detonate the fuse in the shell. As with most artillery weapons firing at aircraft, the higher the shell travelled the less effective it became. A shell fired to 1,500 metres (5,000 feet) would only <b>be</b> <b>half</b> as effective at 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) and a quarter as accurate at 4,500 metres (15,000 feet). The German bombers usually tried to fly around heavy concentrations of anti-aircraft guns, and if forced to fly through them, chose to fly at heights of around 4,500 metres (15,000 feet).|$|E

25|$|The {{phosphor}} {{drops off}} in efficiency during use. By around 25,000 operating hours, it will typically <b>be</b> <b>half</b> {{the brightness of}} a new lamp (although some manufacturers claim much longer half-lives for their lamps). Lamps that do not suffer failures of the emission mix or integral ballast electronics will eventually develop this failure mode. They still work, but have become dim and inefficient. The process is slow, and often becomes obvious only when a new lamp is operating next to an old one.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Airbus {{estimated}} {{that there was a}} market for 120–150 airframes annually; the company intends to initially ramp up the manufacturing rate to roughly 50 aircraft per year. In July 2016, it was announced that the aeromechanical configuration of the rotorcraft had been frozen. Manufacturing of the first production H160 is scheduled for 2017; the first delivery may take place in late 2018 or early 2019. A new production scheme, drawing inspiration from the automotive industry, is to be implemented in the H160's construction; it is a stated aim for the final assembly lead time of the new rotorcraft to <b>be</b> <b>half</b> of that of the preceding Dauphin.|$|E

25|$|Van der Weyden {{worked from}} life models, and his {{observations}} were acute, yet he often idealised certain elements of his models' facial features, {{and they are}} typically statuesque, especially in his triptychs. All of his forms are rendered with rich, warm colourisation and a sympathetic expression, while he {{is known for his}} expressive pathos and naturalism. His portraits tend to <b>be</b> <b>half</b> length and half profile, and he is as sympathetic here as in his religious triptychs. Van der Weyden used an unusually broad range of colours and varied tones; in his finest work the same tone is not repeated in any other area of the canvas; even the whites are varied.|$|E
25|$|The estuary is shallow {{because of}} this {{constant}} deposition. Isostatic recoil is, however, causing the area to sink {{at the rate of}} 3mm annually and global warming is making the sea level rise. The combined effects of these processes mean that the sea in the estuary may <b>be</b> <b>half</b> a metre higher by the year 2050. A large area around the estuary consists of land which lies below the present high-water mark. Flood defences offer only a short-term and local answer and may actually increase the long-term risks. Managed realignment of the coast by setting back the coastal defences will provide new intertidal habitats and harness natural equalising processes and is the preferred long term solution.|$|E
25|$|The paid firemen had no days off, {{were not}} allowed to leave their post except for one meal, and were seldom allowed to leave the firehouse unless on fire {{business}} or a family emergency. An ordinance in 1859 made it illegal to give firemen alcoholic beverages. Their clothes were irregular; uniforms were not worn until 1874, with a regulation uniform established in 1928. Firemen had to buy their own uniforms until 1943, when a $60 clothing allowance was established. An attempt to remove politics from the fire department was not very successful; it was necessary to mandate that the department staff <b>be</b> <b>half</b> Republican and half Democrat, and the role of fire chief was based on political affiliation and family contacts.|$|E

25|$|Starting in late 1932 Kristiansand Municipality {{asked that}} the airport be {{moved out of the}} city center. They {{proposed}} Kongsgårdsbukta in Topdalsfjorden, a site which would from 1934 host the civilian Kristiansand Airport, Kongsgårdbukta. The Naval Air Service agreed, but of different reasons. At high tide and onshore wind the water level could <b>be</b> <b>half</b> a meter above the floor level in the first hangar. The military proposed moving the station to Bragdøya. Meanwhile, Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik was being planned and opened in 1939. By then the Naval Air Service proposed that a new station would be built at Andøya and planning of this started. However, the Ministry of Defense instead wanted the air station situated at Kjevik. Nothing came of either plan until the German occupation in 1940. Luftwaffe opted to build a water aerodrome at Kjevik and closed the naval air station.|$|E
25|$|Composition is {{calculated}} from three primary sources: albedo, surface spectrum, and density. The last {{can only be}} determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have. So far, every asteroid with moons {{has turned out to}} be a rubble pile, a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may <b>be</b> <b>half</b> empty space by volume. The investigated asteroids are as large as 280km in diameter, and include 121 Hermione (268×186×183km), and 87 Sylvia (384×262×232km). Only half a dozen asteroids are larger than 87 Sylvia, though none of them have moons; however, some smaller asteroids are thought to be more massive, suggesting they may not have been disrupted, and indeed 511 Davida, the same size as Sylvia to within measurement error, is estimated to be two and a half times as massive, though this is highly uncertain. The fact that such large asteroids as Sylvia can be rubble piles, presumably due to disruptive impacts, has important consequences for the formation of the Solar System: Computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging, but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge. This means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quickly.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, the Bulls lost Grant, Cartwright and Scott Williams to free agency, and John Paxson to retirement, but {{picked up}} {{shooting}} guard Ron Harper, the seeming heir apparent to Jordan in assistant coach Tex Winter's triple-post offense, and small-forward Jud Buechler. The Bulls started Armstrong and Harper in the backcourt, Pippen and Kukoc at the forward spots, and Perdue at center. They also had sharpshooter Steve Kerr, whom they acquired via free agency before the 1993–94 season, Myers, and centers Luc Longley (acquired via trade in 1994 from the Minnesota Timberwolves) and Bill Wennington. However, they were struggling during the season, on March 18, 1995, they received {{the news that}} Michael Jordan {{was coming out of}} retirement. He scored 55 points against the Knicks in only his fifth game back, and led the Bulls to the fifth seed in the playoffs, where they defeated the Charlotte Hornets. However, Jordan and the Bulls were unable to overcome the eventual Eastern Conference champion Orlando Magic, which included Horace Grant, Anfernee Hardaway, and Shaquille O'Neal. When Jordan returned to the Bulls, he initially wore No. 45 (which was his number while playing for the Birmingham Barons, a minor-league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox). He chose the No. 45 because his older brother Larry wore that number in high school. Michael wanted to <b>be</b> <b>half</b> as good as his brother so he chose 23 which is half of 45 (22.5) rounded up. However, Jordan switched back to the familiar 23 before game 2 of the Orlando Magic series.|$|E
