During the first minute of the match, Leeds fans turned their <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> the match in protest of, what was viewed as, a lack of justice.|$|E

5|$|Auburn, like Virginia Tech, {{had gone}} 8–5 during the 2003 college {{football}} season, {{and entered the}} 2004 season with high expectations. The Tigers were using a new offensive scheme—the West Coast offense—and boasted two highly rated running <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> offense. In its {{first game of the}} 2004 season, the 18th-ranked Auburn football team overwhelmed the University of Louisiana-Monroe, 31–0. It was Auburn's first shutout since 2002. One week later, the Tigers backed up their good start with an emphatic 43–14 victory over Southeastern Conference foe Mississippi State University. In the third week of the season, Auburn faced its first challenge of the young season, against the fourth-ranked Louisiana State Tigers. In a hard-fought defensive struggle, Auburn won, 10–9, when a missed extra point was replayed after a penalty.|$|E

25|$|In February 1991, the WLAF {{held its}} inaugural draft, {{and unlike the}} NFL Draft, the WLAF version was carried out with {{individual}} positions being drafted {{over a period of}} several days. Offensive linemen were drafted on February 14; running backs, punters and placekickers on February 16; quarterbacks, wide receivers and tight ends on February 18; defensive linemen on February 20; linebackers on February 22; and defensive <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> February 24. The most notable player drafted by the Fire was when they selected Brent Pease with the first overall selection in the quarterbacks draft. Training camp started shortly thereafter, and in mid-March the Fire lost to San Antonio in a controlled scrimmage at San Marcos, Texas.|$|E
25|$|On the Giants next possession, {{they scored}} on a 12-play, 57-yard drive in which they burned the 49ers with a fake field goal, {{starting}} out in normal kicking formation before switching into a shotgun formation with holder Jeff Rutledge as the quarterback. San Francisco's field goal blocking unit was caught without enough defensive <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> the field and Rutledge ended up throwing the ball to a wide open Bavaro for a 23-yard gain on the 49ers 5-yard line. A penalty pushed them back 10 yards, but New York still scored on third down with Simms' 15-yard pass to receiver Bobby Johnson. The situation only got worse for San Francisco from there, as Montana was knocked {{out of the game}} due to a hit by nose tackle Jim Burt, while linebacker Lawrence Taylor intercepted his pass and returned it 34 yards for a touchdown, giving the Giants a 28-3 halftime lead.|$|E
25|$|Pietersen {{scored a}} 96-ball 108 not {{out in the}} tied second ODI at Bloemfontein, after which the crowd turned their <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> him as he {{returned}} to the pavilion. This score set his ODI average at an incredible record 234.00. He made 75 at Cape Town, then at East London Pietersen made an unbeaten 100 from only 69 balls, the fastest century by an England player in a one-day match, although England still lost by eight runs. In the final game at Centurion Park, Pietersen came to the wicket at 32/3 and scored 116, but again could not prevent a defeat. Pietersen ended the series, which England lost 4–1, with 454 runs in five innings, and the Player of the Series award. By the end of the series, the South African crowds had generally replaced hostility with respect for Pietersen, his final century being awarded a standing ovation.|$|E

25|$|In early Christianity, the {{practice}} of praying towards the east {{did not result in}} uniformity in the orientation of the buildings in which Christians worshipped and did not mean that the priest necessarily faced away from the congregation, the meaning today commonly attached to the phrase ad orientem. The earliest churches in Rome had a façade to the east and an apse with the altar to the west; the priest celebrating Mass stood behind the altar, facing east and so towards the people. According to Louis Bouyer, not only the priest but also the congregation faced east at prayer, a view strongly criticized {{on the grounds of the}} unlikelihood that, in churches where the altar was to the west, they would turn their <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> the altar (and the priest) at the celebration of the Eucharist. The view prevails therefore that the priest, facing east, would celebrate ad populum in some churches, in others not, in accordance with the churches' architecture.|$|E
25|$|Smbat's successes shortly {{came to a}} halt when Afshin {{decided that}} he could not countenance a {{powerful}} Armenia so close to his domains. He retook Dvin and managed to take Smbat's wife as a hostage until she was released in exchange for Smbat's son and nephew. The wars against Armenia continued even after Afshin's death in 901, when his brother Yusuf Ibn Abi'l-Saj became ostikan of Arminiya. While Yusuf's reign was not immediately hostile, Smbat committed a series of blunders which led to several of his allies to turn their <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> him: having sought to placate his eastern ally, Smbat of Syunik, by ceding to him Nakhichevan city, Smbat inadvertently drove Gagik Artsruni of Vaspurakan into Yusuf's arms since the city was a part of Gagik's domains. Yusuf took advantage of this feud by awarding Gagik a crown in 908, thus making him King Gagik I of Vaspurakan and creating an Armenian state opposed to the one led by Smbat.|$|E
25|$|Again playing {{without their}} entire {{starting}} backfield, the Buccaneers outgained Green Bay in several major offensive statistics, including a 321–173 yardage advantage, but were outscored by the Packers. A knee injury to Lee Roy Selmon meant {{that all three}} of their players selected with first-round draft picks were out with injuries. George Ragsdale, Johnny Davis, Jim Obradovich, Neil O'Donoghue, and Danny Reece were also injured during the game, which left the Buccaneers with only three running <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> the roster. The Buccaneers finished the game with only 37 healthy players, eight under the NFL roster limit. The 173 yards allowed {{was one of several}} team records set during the game, and the season total to date of 228 points equaled the team's total scoring of the first two seasons combined. Ragsdale's 14-yard touchdown run was their longest touchdown run of the year. Ragsdale, having been knocked cold, was unable to hear the crowd's applause. The Packers scored on a 10-yard David Whitehurst pass to James Lofton, a 27-yard Chester Marcol field goal, and a 1-yard Barty Smith run. The win broke the Packers’ four-game losing streak.|$|E
