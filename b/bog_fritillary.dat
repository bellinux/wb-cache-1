50|$|This {{pattern of}} mating affects the migratory {{behavior}} of Proclossiana eunomia. This physical moving of individual {{of a species}} {{is dependent on the}} density of the population. At high male densities females are harassed by willing males, resulting in female-biased emigration where females leave the imminent area. At low male densities, females are not bothered and are safe to stay in their local environment. In addition, at low female densities males might begin to emigrate out of the area in search for new unmated females whereas at high female density males already enjoy a wide selection of females without a need to migrate. The polygynous mating system of the <b>bog</b> <b>fritillary</b> whereby males freely pursue females induces a change in migratory behavior.|$|E

40|$|Entomologists {{traditionally}} use the Jolly-Seber {{analytical method}} (JSAM) to estimate demographic parameters from capture-mark-recapture data, although more powerful approaches like the constrained linear models (CLM) {{have been developed}} and are commonly and successfully applied to vertebrates. Demographic parameters (i. e., survival, capture, and recruitment rates, population size, and sex ratio) of a patchy population of the <b>Bog</b> <b>Fritillary</b> butterfly, Proclossiana eunomia (Esp.) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae), were estimated. using CLM {{on the basis of}} daily captures of imagoes during 11 yearly generations (1992 - 2002). Comparing these results with JSAM results obtained on the same data lead us to stress that CLM are far more powerful tools which allow for optimal exploitation of capture-mark-recapture data. This method allows the identification of the variation patterns of demographic parameters and to link them to life-history traits; furthermore it gives more precise estimates of these crucial input parameters for the modelling of population trends and population viability analysis...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies on}} metapopulation {{dynamics}} {{have emphasized the}} need for improved methods for quantifying individual movements between local populations and habitat patches. In this paper, we report on a 6 -yr study in which a network of 12 habitat patches occupied by the <b>bog</b> <b>fritillary,</b> Proclossiana eunomia, was surveyed, with special focus on quantifying movements between the habitat patches. We applied the Virtual Migration model which {{has been designed to}} estimate survival and migration parameters in a metapopulation of several connected local populations, The model was parameterized using mark-release-recapture data collected during 6 yr. Generally, the estimated parameter values indicated a high level of movements, with roughly half of butterfly-days spent outside the natal patch. Mortality within patches was higher in males than in females. Females tended to be more mobile and spent more time outside their natal patch than males. Further analysis of the MRR data shows that in this protandrous species males tend to move very little between habitat patches before substantial numbers of females have emerged...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} habitat loss and fragmentation on population functioning. We compared demography (daily and total population sizes) and dispersal (dispersal rate and dispersal kernels) of the <b>bog</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly in two 6 -km(2) landscapes differing in their degree of fragmentation. In 2000, we conducted a Capture-Mark-Recapture experiment in a highly fragmented system in the marginal part of the species distribution (Belgium) and in a more continuous system in {{the central part of}} its distribution (Finland). A total of 293 and 947 butterflies were marked with 286 and 190 recapture events recorded in the fragmented and the continuous system respectively. Our results suggest that habitat loss and fragmentation affect dispersal more than demography. Although density was lower in the continuous system, it remains in the yearly range of variation observed on 10 generations in the fragmented system. However, in the fragmented system, the dispersal rate dropped drastically (39 vs. 64 %) and females moved longer distances. Patch area had a significant effect on migration in the fragmented system only. From our results, we propose the definition of a new parameter, the minimal patch area (MPA) needed to establish a local population in highly fragmented landscapes...|$|E
40|$|Populations of the <b>bog</b> <b>fritillary</b> {{butterfly}} Proclossiana eunomia (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) {{occur in}} patchy habitat {{in central and}} western Europe. P. eunomia is a vulnerable species in the Belgian Ardennes {{and the number of}} occupied sites has significantly decreased in this region since the 1960 s. RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) markers were used to study the consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation on the genetic population structure of this species. Gene diversity was lower in populations with smaller population sizes. Genetic subdivision was high (Fst= 0. 0887) considering the small spatial scale of this study (150 km 2). The most geographically isolated population was also the most genetically differentiated one. The genetic population structure and genetic differentiation detected in this study were explained by (1) differences in altitude of the sampled locations and, (2) lower dispersal propensity and dispersal rate in fragmented landscapes versus continuous landscapes. Results from the RAPD analyses were compared with a previous allozyme based study on the same populations. The {{results of this study suggest}} that increased fragmentation has lead to a greater genetic differentiation between remaining P. eunomia populations...|$|E
40|$|Modelling {{dispersal}} is {{a fundamental}} step {{in the design of}} population viability analyses. Here, we address the question of the generalisation of population viability analysis models across landscapes by comparing dispersal between two metapopulations of the <b>bog</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly (Proclossiana eunomia) living in similar highly fragmented landscapes (< 1 % of suitable habitat in 9 km(2)). Differences in dispersal patterns were investigated using the virtual migration (VM) model, which was parameterised with capture-mark-recapture data collected during several years in both landscapes. The VM model allows the estimation of 6 parameters describing dispersal and mortality as well as the simulation of dispersal in the landscapes. The model revealed large differences in the VM parameter estimates between the two landscapes and consequently, simulations indicated differential rates of emigration and dispersal mortality. Furthermore, results from crossed-simulations i. e. simulations performed in one of the landscape but using parameter estimates from the other landscape emphasize that dispersal parameters are very specific to each metapopulation and to their landscape. Hence, we urge conservation biologists to be cautious with such parameter generalisations, even for the same species in comparable landscapes...|$|E
40|$|Comparison of {{dispersal}} {{rates of}} the <b>bog</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly between continuous and fragmented landscapes indicates that between patch dispersal is significantly lower in the fragmented landscape, while population densities are of the same order of magnitude. Analyses {{of the dynamics of}} the suitable habitat for the butterfly in the fragmented landscape reveal a severe, non linear increase in spatial isolation of patches over a time period of 30 years (i. e. 30 butterfly generations), but simulations of the butterfly metapopulation dynamics using a structured population model show that the lower dispersal rates in the fragmented landscape are far above the critical threshold leading to metapopulation extinction. These results indicate that changes in individual behaviour leading to the decrease of dispersal rates in the fragmented landscape were rapidly selected for when patch spatial isolation increased. The evidence of such an adaptive answer to habitat fragmentation suggests that dispersal mortality is a key factor for metapopulation persistence in fragmented landscapes. We emphasise that landscape spatial configuration and patch isolation have {{to be taken into account}} in the debate about large-scale conservation strategies. (C) 2003 Academie des sciences.

40|$|Habitat {{preservation}} and restoration are cornerstones of species ´ conservation {{and the main}} challenge for nature managers. To preserve species, lots of preventive measures or restoration projects are in progress in Europe. But, to improve {{the effectiveness of this}} undertaking, it would be highly desirable to: (1) identify precisely species ´ habitat requirements, (2) develop means to maintain or restore habitats, (3) assess effects of diverse habitat management methods on population dynamics and (4) find way(s) to evaluate and minimize their potential negative impacts. Here we focus on two relict butterfly species, the violet copper, Lycaena helle, and the <b>bog</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly, Proclossiana eunomia. Both species inhabit alluvial humid grasslands and peatbogs in the Belgian Ardenne, and share the same hostplant, the bistort, Polygonum bistorta. Results: Field studies and experiments carried out at several sites showed that: (1) The two species have slightly different habitat requirements. L. helle thrive in the neighbourhood of forest edges and P. eunomia reproduce preferentially at places with big grass tussocks and a high density of hostplants. This can be better understood and described with reference to the resources used by the species in the ecological space and time (Dennis, Shreeve & Van Dyck 2003).

40|$|Metapopulation models {{predicting}} {{the persistence of}} species {{on the verge of}} extinction in fragmented landscapes have to include local population dynamics. In this paper, we report on a 9 -yr study in which a patchy population of the <b>bog</b> <b>fritillary</b> was monitored each year, with special focus on quantifying demographic parameters. We parameterised various constrained linear models (CLM) with capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data collected in the field each year and we tested the effects of several variables on demographic parameters. Selecting the best CLM, we estimated the mean and the variance of (1) individual parameters (survival and catchability) and (2) population features (population size, sex-ratio and recruitment). Survival was not related to the age of the individual but decreased continuously during the flight period, which means that lifetime expectancy is conversely related to the delay between the moment of the emergence of a given individual as compared to the emergence of the first adult in the population. Survival was lower in males than in females, as a consequence of male mate-locating behaviour. Daily population size fits a parabolic distribution in both sexes, males appearing, reaching their abundance peak and dying before females. Yearly variation in the sex-ratio is the consequence of the between-sex difference in the recruitment curve. Total adult population size shows large variations between years. Analysis of the relation between growth rate and abundance indicates density dependence, probably related to parasitism of the larval stages. Density at the equilibrium is about 200 adults/ha...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Dispersal between habitat patches is a {{key process}} in the {{functioning}} of (meta) populations. As distance between suitable habitats increases, the ongoing process of habitat fragmentation is expected to generate strong selection pressures on movement behaviour. This leads to an increase or decrease of dispersal according to its cost relative to landscape structure. To limit the cost of dispersal in an increasingly hostile matrix, we predict that organisms would adopt special dispersal behaviour between habitats, which are different from movements associated with resource searching in suitable habitats. Results Here we quantified the movement behaviour of the <b>bog</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly (Proclossiana eunomia) by (1) assessing perceptual range, the distance to which the habitat can be perceived, and (2) tracking and parameterizing movement behaviour within and outside habitat (parameters were move length and turning angles distributions). Results are three-fold. (1) Perceptual range was Conclusion The perceptual range being lower than the distance between habitat patches in the study area, P. eunomia likely perceives these habitat networks as fragmented, and must locate suitable habitats while dispersing across the landscape matrix. Such a constraint means that dispersal entails costs, and that selection pressure should favour behaviours that limit these costs. Indeed, our finding that dispersal movements in the matrix are straighter than resource searching movements within habitat supports the prediction of simulation studies that adopting straight movements for dispersal reduces its costs in fragmented landscapes. Our results support the mounting evidence that dispersal in fragmented landscapes evolved towards the use of specific movement behaviour, different from explorative searching movements within habitat. </p...|$|E
40|$|Management of {{semi-natural}} open ecosystems {{has become}} a necessity for biodiversity conservation in Europe. However, management methods are most often experience-based, rather than science-based. Here, we explore the impact of extensive (light) grazing, which is often the only practical management solution to stop ecological succession towards forest. A metapopulation of the <b>bog</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly (Proclossiana eunomia), a wet meadow specialist, was monitored for 15 generations: 11 before and four after the introduction of cattle grazing in some habitat patches. We relate the observed changes in P. eunomia abundance and recruitment {{to the effect of}} grazing on vegetation descriptors linked to habitat quality for the butterfly. Cattle strongly decreased the abundance of the butterfly host plant, destroyed grass tussocks used by caterpillars for sun basking, and altered vegetation composition and physiognomy. Consequently, grazed habitat patches are less suitable for P. eunomia: recruitment rate and butterfly use decreased by 2 / 3, whereas emigration rate increased drastically; this is likely to alter the viability of the metapopulation. We therefore propose modifications to its current implementation to limit its negative side-effects. More generally, it is of prime importance that conservation biologists and site managers collaborate in ensuring that sound ecological evaluations {{become an integral part of}} the design and application of management plans. This implies the monitoring of crucial indicators of the system state and variability before the beginning of the management, and the maintenance of unmanaged areas as biological preserves in case of negative impact and as controls for statistical tests of impact.

40|$|Habitat {{quality and}} the impact of natural enemies might profoundly affect metapopulation {{dynamics}} and viability. However, their relative impact has usually been considered independently. Here we address the question of how caterpillar habitat quality and parasitism prevalence interact to shape habitat selection in the <b>bog</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly Boloria eunomia, parasitized at the caterpillar stage by a specialist wasp, Cotesia euno- miae. We first classified habitat quality by relating caterpillar density to descriptors of different microhabitat types. Second, we investigated parasitism prevalence in those dif- ferent microhabitats. Our results show that caterpillars and parasitoids mapped onto the same microhabitats, mainly zones with high abundance of the host plant. Accordingly, we suggest that both egg-laying females and parasitoids use the same cues for habitat selec- tion. As a consequence, there should be a fitness cost for B. eunomia females to lay their eggs in places where parasitism prevalence is high. We indeed detected that B. eunomia females frequently laid eggs in habitat types that presented suboptimal microhabitat conditions for caterpillars. This suggests that the lower parasitism prevalence in these suboptimal habitat types counterbalances lower caterpillar survival, leading to an overall similar survival in optimal and suboptimal habitat types. Spreading eggs in different habitat types is thus expected to be a safe strategy to mitigate the adverse possible effects of environmental stochasticity and parasitism prevalence on offspring survival unequal among microhabitat types. From a conservation viewpoint, the preservation of habitat heterogeneity, including optimal but also suboptimal habitat areas, is crucial to ensure persistence of both the host and its parasitoid...|$|E
40|$|Many species {{living in}} man-shaped landscapes are {{restricted}} to small natural habitat patches and form metapopulations; predicting their future is a central issue in applied ecology. We examined {{the viability of the}} <b>bog</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly Proclossiana eunomia Esper, a specialist glacial relict species, in a highly fragmented landscape (B 1 % of suitable habitat in 10 km 2), by way of population viability analysis. We used comprehensive data from a long-term study in which a patchy population was monitored during ten consecutive years to parameterise a spatially structured metapopulation model using commercially available platform RAMAS/GIS 3. 0. Population growth rate was density-dependent and modulated by various climatic variables acting on different developmental stages of the butterfly. Density dependence was probably related to larval parasitism by a specific parasitoid. Population size was negatively affected by an increase in the mean temperature. Dispersal was modelled as the observed proportion of movements between patches, taking into account the probability of emigration out of a given patch. Our model provided results close to the picture of the system drawn from the field data and was considered as useful in making predictions about the metapopulation. Demographic parameters proved to have a far higher impact on metapopulation persistence than dispersal or correlation of local dynamics. Scenarios simulating both global warming and management of habitat patches by rustic herbivore grazing indicated a decrease in the viability of the metapopulation. Our results prompted the regional nature conservation agency to modify the planned management regime. We urge conservation biologists to use structured population models including local population dynamics for viability analysis targeted to such threatened metapopulations in highly fragmented landscapes...|$|E

40|$|Habitat {{preservation}} and restoration are crucial for species conservation and to tackle its main challenges. In many cases, this implies management actions, especially for seminatural ecosystems. We address here {{the question of}} management actions suitable for maintaining viable populations of two relict butterfly species inhabiting wet meadows and peat bogs in the Belgian Ardenne: the <b>bog</b> <b>fritillary</b> Proclossiana eunomia and the violet copper Lycaena helle. Habitat loss due to natural vegetation succession towards forest can be prevented either by mowing (traditional way of management) or by extensive grazing (with cattle or horses). Results from field studies and experiments conducted on several sites in the Belgian Ardenne led to two conclusions. Mowing can strongly affect the populations of both species, the impact being particularly pronounced on larval stages due to the removal of grass tussocks and the export of hay containing host plant on which caterpillars feed. Grazing also has {{a negative effect on}} both species, with adult density being lower on grazed biotopes compared to abandoned ones. However, the negative impact is more limited for grazing than for mowing. As both management methods have more or less pronounced negative impacts on populations of these two butterfly species, they should be applied with caution. We suggest that mowing should be applied in long-term rotation, with the preservation of sufficient refuge areas every year, and that grazing should be applied in late summer, every other year, with a low stocking rate (< 0. 2 LU/ha/year). More particularly, to ensure their effectiveness in maintaining a favorable state, both the biotope and the associated populations using it as their habitat, managementactions must be designed according to the species habitat requirements, and adapted to carefully monitor their implementatio...|$|E
