5|$|Minnesota {{has four}} {{ecological}} provinces: Prairie Parkland, {{in the southwestern}} and western parts of the state; the Eastern <b>Broadleaf</b> Forest (Big Woods) in the southeast, extending in a narrowing strip to the state's northwestern part, where it transitions into Tallgrass Aspen Parkland; and the northern Laurentian Mixed Forest, a transitional forest between the northern boreal forest and the <b>broadleaf</b> forests to the south. These northern forests are a vast wilderness of pine and spruce trees mixed with patchy stands of birch and poplar.|$|E
5|$|Two {{wetlands}} can {{be found}} in the sub-watershed of John Summerson Branch Trout Run. One is a mixed graminoid swamp and the other is a <b>broadleaf</b> conifer swamp.|$|E
5|$|Boletus auripes is mycorrhizal, {{and fruits}} singly, scattered, or in {{groups on the}} ground under <b>broadleaf</b> trees, {{especially}} oak and beech, {{but it has also}} been recorded associating with mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia). Boletus auripes typically forms fruit bodies between June and November.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{researchers}} {{studying the}} presence or absence of a dorsal stripe suggested that it has independently evolved several times in Timema species and is an adaptation for crypsis on needle-like leaves. All of the eight Timema species with a dorsal stripe have at least one host plant with needle-like foliage. Of the thirteen unstriped species, seven feed only on <b>broadleaf</b> plants. Four (T. ritensis, T. podura, T. genevieve, and T. coffmani) rest during the day on the host plant's trunk rather than its leaves and have bodies that are brown, gray, or tan. Only two species (T. nakipa and T. boharti) have green unstriped morphs that feed on needle-like foliage; both are generalist feeders that also feed on <b>broadleaf</b> hosts.|$|E
5|$|Japan {{has nine}} forest {{ecoregions}} which reflect {{the climate and}} geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist <b>broadleaf</b> forests in the Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to temperate <b>broadleaf</b> and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands. Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife, including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the large Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander. A large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as thirty-seven Ramsar wetland sites. Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.|$|E
5|$|Because of its mild climate, many species, {{including}} sub-tropical {{species such}} as palm trees, are grown in Ireland. Phytogeographically, Ireland belongs to the Atlantic European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. The island itself can be subdivided into two ecoregions: the Celtic <b>broadleaf</b> forests and North Atlantic moist mixed forests.|$|E
5|$|In {{suitable}} environments, {{such as the}} Daintree Rainforest in Queensland, or {{the mixed}} podocarp and <b>broadleaf</b> forest of Ulva Island, New Zealand, forest is the more-or-less stable climatic climax community {{at the end of}} a plant succession, where open areas such as grassland are colonised by taller plants, which in turn give way to trees that eventually form a forest canopy.|$|E
5|$|Where {{rainfall}} {{is relatively}} evenly {{spread across the}} seasons in temperate regions, temperate <b>broadleaf</b> and mixed forest typified by species like oak, beech, birch and maple is found. Temperate forest {{is also found in}} the southern hemisphere, as for example in the Eastern Australia temperate forest, characterised by Eucalyptus forest and open acacia woodland.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{the tree}} grows thicker and taller as {{successive}} rings develop around its trunk and new buds grow on the branches. The tree {{becomes part of}} an old growth forest with a shaded and damp understory of <b>broadleaf</b> trees, shrubs, and ferns. In the canopy, a mat of dead needles and lichen accumulate on the wide upper branches. Exposed to light, air, and rain, the needles decompose and the mat becomes colonized by insects, fungus, and new plants.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of European American {{settlers}} and explorers, the Allegheny Plateau region of West Virginia, lying {{to the west of the}} Allegheny and Cumberland mountain ranges of the Appalachian Mountains, was overlaid with old-growth forests consisting predominantly of deciduous mixed oaks and chestnut trees. The cove forests of the Appalachian Mountains were undisturbed for approximately 300 million years, and the ample moisture and deep soils of cove topography allowed for the proliferation of temperate <b>broadleaf</b> and mixed forest species.|$|E
5|$|Reptile {{habitats}} in Michigan {{are generally}} split into four regions: {{the northern and}} southern Lower Peninsula and the eastern and western Upper Peninsula, with differentiations based on climate, soils, underlying bedrock and glacially-derived landforms. Region one, the southern Lower Peninsula, is generally characterized by a warmer, less variable climate. Loam and clay soils dominate the region, with a lesser amount of sand. Deciduous hardwoods are the dominant tree species, with some natural prairies and savannas. There is a greater diversity of plant life in this region, and it includes plant and animal species that are not found in any of the other regions. Region two, the northern Lower Peninsula, has a climate that is cooler and more variable, with greater precipitation due to its proximity to the Great Lakes, more extensive uplands and more northern latitude. Sandy soils and glacial deposits are the dominant soil type, while forests of conifer or mixed conifer and hardwood predominate. Swamps and bogs are found more often in region two than region one. Region three, the eastern Upper Peninsula, has a climate profile similar to region two. Sand and clay dominate the soil of this region, which tends to be low in nutrients and poorly drained. There are extensive wetlands, dominated by coniferous forests, while upland areas provide mixed conifer and <b>broadleaf</b> hardwood tracts. Region four, the western Upper Peninsula, provides extensive bedrock structures. The temperature is less moderate than in the other three regions, and can see frigid winters and hot summers. Mixed conifer and <b>broadleaf</b> forests again dominate.|$|E
5|$|Several {{different}} {{habitat types}} {{are found in}} Ireland, including farmland, open woodland, temperate <b>broadleaf</b> and mixed forests, conifer plantations, peat bogs {{and a variety of}} coastal habitats. However, agriculture drives current land use patterns in Ireland, limiting natural habitat preserves, particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs. With no large apex predators in Ireland other than humans and dogs, such populations of animals as semi-wild deer that cannot be controlled by smaller predators, such as the fox, are controlled by annual culling.|$|E
5|$|The Western Ghats {{are home}} to four {{tropical}} and subtropical moist <b>broadleaf</b> forest ecoregions – the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests, North Western Ghats montane rain forests, South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests, and South Western Ghats montane rain forests. The northern portion of the range is generally drier than the southern portion, and at lower elevations makes up the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests ecoregion, with mostly deciduous forests made up predominantly of teak. Above 1,000 meters elevation are the cooler and wetter North Western Ghats montane rain forests, whose evergreen forests are characterised by trees of family Lauraceae.|$|E
5|$|The most {{widespread}} {{species is}} the brown bear, which occurs from Western Europe eastwards through Asia {{to the western}} areas of North America. The American black bear is restricted to North America, and the polar bear is restricted to the Arctic Sea. All the remaining species of bear are Asian. They occur {{in a range of}} habitats which include tropical lowland rainforest, both coniferous and <b>broadleaf</b> forests, prairies, steppes, montane grassland, alpine scree slopes, Arctic tundra {{and in the case of}} the polar bear, ice floes. Bears may dig their dens in hillsides or use caves, hollow logs and dense vegetation for shelter.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} wildflower {{species in the}} uplands and rock outcroppings of the Turkey Hill Oxbow. These include white baneberry, northern maidenhair fern, spikenard, blue cohosh, foamflower, false Solomon's seal, purple trillium, and wild columbine. Animals inhabiting the areas surrounding the pools include pickerel frogs, green frogs, wood ducks, and snapping turtles. Plants in this location include <b>broadleaf</b> arrowhead, northern blueflag, manna grasses, water starwort, and several varieties of sedges. Japanese knotweed has been seen near Interstate 80 on the northern edges of the Turkey Hill Oxbow.|$|E
5|$|Biomes {{are larger}} units of {{organization}} that categorize {{regions of the}} Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation. There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include tropical rainforest, temperate <b>broadleaf</b> and mixed forest, temperate deciduous forest, taiga, tundra, hot desert, and polar desert. Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic microbiomes. To a microbe, {{the human body is}} a habitat and a landscape. Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in molecular genetics, which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome plays {{a significant role in the}} ecological biogeochemistry of the planet's oceans.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand's {{geographic}} isolation for 80 million years and island biogeography has influenced {{evolution of the}} country's species of animals, fungi and plants. Physical isolation has not caused biological isolation, and this {{has resulted in a}} dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of very distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species. About 82% of New Zealand's indigenous vascular plants are endemic, covering 1,944 species across 65 genera and includes a single endemic family. The number of fungi recorded from New Zealand, including lichen-forming species, is not known, nor is the proportion of those fungi which are endemic, but one estimate suggests there are about 2,300 species of lichen-forming fungi in New Zealand and 40% of these are endemic. The two main types of forest are those dominated by <b>broadleaf</b> trees with emergent podocarps, or by southern beech in cooler climates. The remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands, the majority of which are tussock.|$|E
5|$|Strandzha Nature Park {{falls within}} two {{terrestrial}} ecoregions of the Palearctic temperate <b>broadleaf</b> and mixed forest— the Balkan mixed forests and the Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests. Forests cover 80% of the park's area, with old-growth forest forming 30% of them. These woods {{are the last}} remaining temperate forests with evergreen laurel undergrowth in Europe. The park has {{the highest number of}} vertebrate species of all protected areas in Bulgaria, including 66 species of mammals, 269 species of birds, 24 species of reptiles, 10 species of amphibia and 41 species of freshwater fish, as well as 70 species of marine fish in the waters of the Black Sea. The invertebrate fauna is poorly researched and includes 84 Bulgarian endemic species, of which 4 are local, and 34 relict species.|$|E
5|$|The {{discipline}} of plant ecology was pioneered {{in the late}} 19th century by botanists such as Eugenius Warming, who produced the hypothesis that plants form communities, and his mentor and successor Christen C. Raunkiær whose system for describing plant life forms is still in use today. The concept that the composition of plant communities such as temperate <b>broadleaf</b> forest changes by a process of ecological succession was developed by Henry Chandler Cowles, Arthur Tansley and Frederic Clements. Clements is credited {{with the idea of}} climax vegetation as the most complex vegetation that an environment can support and Tansley introduced the concept of ecosystems to biology. Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse de Candolle, Nikolai Vavilov (1887–1943) produced accounts of the biogeography, centres of origin, and evolutionary history of economic plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{geography}} of Ratanakiri Province is diverse, encompassing rolling hills, mountains, plateaus, lowland watersheds, and crater lakes. Two major rivers, Tonle San and Tonle Srepok, flow {{from east to}} west across the province. The province is known for its lush forests; as of 1997, 70–80% of the province was forested, either with old-growth forest or with secondary forest regrown after shifting cultivation. In the far north of the province are mountains of the Annamite Range; the area is characterized by dense <b>broadleaf</b> evergreen forests, relatively poor soil, and abundant wildlife. In the highlands between Tonle San and Tonle Srepok, the home of the vast majority of Ratanakiri's population, a hilly basalt plateau provides fertile red soils. Secondary forests dominate this region. South of the Srepok River is a flat area of tropical deciduous forests.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{described}} as new to science in 1774 by Jacob Christian Schaeffer. Its distribution encompasses Asia, North Africa, Europe, and Central America. Its presence in North America has not been clarified, due to confusion with the similar species Russula parvovirescens and R.crustosa. R.virescens fruits singly or scattered {{on the ground in}} both deciduous and mixed forests, forming mycorrhizal associations with <b>broadleaf</b> trees such as oak, European beech, and aspen. In Asia, it associates with several species of tropical lowland rainforest trees of the family Dipterocarpaceae. R.virescens has a ribonuclease enzyme with a biochemistry unique among edible mushrooms. It also has biologically active polysaccharides, and a laccase enzyme that can break down several dyes used in the laboratory and in the textile industry.|$|E
5|$|The trail follows forest tracks, {{mountain}} paths, boreens {{and quiet}} country roads. Mountains, upland lakes and steep-sided glacial valleys {{make up the}} terrain of the initial northern sections of the Way before giving way to gentler rolling foothills in the latter southern sections. Much of the route follows the contact point between the igneous granite of {{the western side of}} Wicklow and the metamorphic schists and slates of the eastern side. The principal habitat of the upland sections is a mixture of <b>broadleaf</b> and coniferous woodland, heath and blanket bog while in the lowland sections the hedgerows marking the boundaries between fields support a variety of wildlife. The Way also passes the Monastic City at Glendalough, founded in the 6th century by Saint Kevin.|$|E
5|$|The type {{species of}} the genus Ramaria, R.botrytis was first {{described}} scientifically in 1797 by mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. A widely distributed species, it is found in North America, North Africa, central and eastern Europe, Australia, and Asia. The fungus is mycorrhizal with <b>broadleaf</b> trees, and fruits {{on the ground in}} wooded areas. There are several species of coral fungi that are superficially similar in appearance to R.botrytis, and although comparison of habitat or characteristics like color or branching morphology is often sufficient for identification, sometimes microscopy is required to definitively distinguish between them. Fruit bodies of Ramaria botrytis are edible, and young specimens have a mild, fruity taste. Some authors warn of laxative effects in susceptible individuals. The fungus contains several chemical compounds with in vitro biological activity, and fruit bodies have antimicrobial activity against several species and strains of drug-resistant bacteria that cause disease in humans.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} other red-pored, bluing boletes {{that could be}} {{confused}} with S.amygdalinus. The poisonous European species Rubroboletus satanas and its North American counterpart R.eastwoodiae have lighter colored caps and a reticulate pattern on the stipe. B.subvelutipes is a highly variable species from eastern North America that includes red in its range of cap colors, and has a fuzzy coating of hairs near the base of its stipe; it may represent a group of species. Another similar species is B.luridiformis, found in North America and Northern Europe under both <b>broadleaf</b> trees and conifers. Unlike S.amygdalinus, however, B.luridiformis has a dark brown to nearly blackish-brown cap, and a yellow stipe with a dense covering of red pruina (dots).|$|E
5|$|Animals {{typically}} use {{the color}} green as camouflage, blending {{in with the}} chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment. Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also {{be affected by the}} surrounding environment. For example, <b>broadleaf</b> forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light. Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins (lychochromes) and hemanovadin. Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include biliverdin, the green pigment in bile, and ceruloplasmin, a protein that carries copper ions in chelation.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the U.S. Department of the Army {{contracted}} the botanist and bioethicist Arthur Galston, {{who discovered the}} defoliants later used in Agent Orange, and his employer University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana to {{study the effects of}} 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T on cereal grains (including rice) and <b>broadleaf</b> crops. Galston, then {{a graduate student at the}} University of Illinois, in his research and 1943 Ph.D. dissertation focused on finding a chemical means to make soybeans flower and fruit earlier. He discovered both that 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) would speed up the flowering of soybeans and that in higher concentrations it would defoliate the soybeans. From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply. In early 1945, the U.S. Army ran tests of various 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T mixtures at the Bushnell Army Airfield in Florida. As a result, the U.S. began a full-scale production of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and would have used it against Japan in 1946 during Operation Downfall if the war had continued.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese macaque {{lives in}} a variety of habitats. It inhabits {{subtropical}} forests {{in the southern part of}} its range and subarctic forests in mountainous areas in the northern part of its range. It can be found in both warm and cool forests, such as the deciduous forests of central and northern Japan and the <b>broadleaf</b> evergreen forests in the southwest of the islands. Warm temperate evergreen and <b>broadleaf</b> forests and the cool temperate deciduous <b>broadleaf</b> forests are the most important habitats for macaques.|$|E
25|$|The {{dramatic}} changes in elevation along this transect result {{in a variety of}} biomes, from tropical savannas along the Indian border, to subtropical <b>broadleaf</b> and coniferous forests in the hills, to temperate <b>broadleaf</b> and coniferous forests on the slopes of the Himalaya, to montane grasslands and shrublands, and finally rock and ice at the highest elevations.|$|E
25|$|The {{vigorous}} {{growth of}} oats tends to choke out most weeds. A few tall <b>broadleaf</b> weeds, such as ragweed, goosegrass, wild mustard, and buttonweed (velvetleaf), occasionally create a problem, as they complicate harvest and reduce yields. These {{can be controlled}} with a modest application of a <b>broadleaf</b> herbicide, such as 2,4-D, while the weeds are still small.|$|E
25|$|The islets of the Kogatapu have 40% of the {{remaining}} native <b>broadleaf</b> forest on Funafuti atoll.|$|E
25|$|The Monkey River {{has several}} {{important}} ecosystems including: (a) montane <b>broadleaf</b> primary forest; (b) upland coastal plain <b>broadleaf</b> secondary forest; (c) upper river freshwater riverine habitat; (d) lower reach estuarine and mangrove habitats; and (e) Caribbean Sea coral reef and turtle-grass marine habitat. This shallow marine environment {{is home to}} the endangered manatee. Each of these five discrete ecosystems contains important habitat for either terrestrial or aquatic species of southern Belize.|$|E
25|$|The {{woodlands}} of Boho {{consist of}} a mixture of plantation woodlands and semi-natural <b>broadleaf</b> woodlands (mainly ash and hazel).|$|E
25|$|Pinus strobus {{is found}} in the nearctic {{temperate}} <b>broadleaf</b> and mixed forests biome of eastern North America. It prefers well-drained or sandy soils and humid climates, but can also grow in boggy areas and rocky highlands. In mixed forests, this dominant tree towers over many others, including some of the large <b>broadleaf</b> hardwoods. It provides food and shelter for numerous forest birds, such as the red crossbill, and small mammals such as squirrels.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{vegetation}} of the Ithaca area, seen in areas unbuilt and unfarmed, is northern temperate <b>broadleaf</b> forest, dominated by deciduous trees.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the Treaty of Waitangi being {{negotiated}} and signed in January and February 1840, Calton Hill was probably by then a mosaic of tussock grassland and bracken shrubland with pockets of podocarp and <b>broadleaf</b> forest in steep gullies. Botanical records indicate the Calton Hill area that once was covered in dense podocarp, <b>broadleaf</b> forest had been displaced by human-lit fires. In the years prior to this it is unlikely the area would have been used by the small number of Europeans who inhabited the country.|$|E
25|$|Because of Jammu and Kashmir's {{wide range}} of elevations, its {{biogeography}} is diverse. Northwestern thorn scrub forests and Himalayan subtropical pine forests {{are found in the}} low elevations of the far southwest. These give way to a broad band of western Himalayan <b>broadleaf</b> forests running from northwest-southeast across the Kashmir Valley. Rising into the mountains, the <b>broadleaf</b> forests grade into western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests. Above the tree line are found northwestern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows. Much of the northeast of the state is covered by the Karakoram-West Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe. Around the highest elevations, there is no vegetation, simply rock and ice.|$|E
