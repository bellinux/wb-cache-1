30|$|Originally, the {{requirements}} of the LIDAR <b>boresight</b> <b>direction</b> as a navigation tool allowed relative alignment between the Near-Infrared Spectrometer (NIRS 3) and LIDAR to be < 1 °, and for the shift from the −Z axis to be < 0.5 °. Therefore, the tolerance of the shift of the telescope with respect to the spacecraft associated with the launch was not defined quantitatively. In addition, the <b>boresight</b> <b>direction</b> before launch was determined based on the measured differences between the LIDAR boresight and an alignment cube on the LIDAR, and between the alignment cubes on the LIDAR and spacecraft. Therefore, the determined prelaunch <b>boresight</b> <b>direction</b> was treated as a reference value, based on the accuracy requirements stated above. It is concluded that a more precise <b>boresight</b> <b>direction</b> with respect to the spacecraft as a scientific instrument was identified in this experiment.|$|E

30|$|In general, the {{complexity}} of the MUSIC and MVDR algorithms are of the order N 3, for Eigen-decomposition and inversion of input correlation matrix, respectively [24 – 26]. Therefore, adding two elements to the array causes that the computational load rise to order (N + 2) 3. The size of the ULA aperture affects the resolution threshold, especially at <b>boresight</b> <b>directions.</b> Hence if two elements at both ends of PA be lessened, computational cost remains the same, while the PA still performs well at endfire directions. Simulation results show that in this situation the resolution threshold may be a little decreased. Therefore, the increase in computational cost prevents the changes of resolution threshold in <b>boresight</b> <b>directions.</b>|$|R

This device was controlled by a microprocessor to minimize the offsets of the phase centers in the cassegrain RF system and also compensated for <b>boresight</b> <b>directions.</b> The use of the radiation program to predict the gain losses from displacements computed by a structural computing program using an analytical model of the 34 meter reflector structure is discussed.

30|$|The {{conventional}} ULA is {{the most}} common array geometry for smart antenna systems and array signal processing. Beside great advantages, the ULA does not perform uniform for all angles in the spatial spectrum and cannot detect or resolve close sources located at endfires, accurately. In this article, new ULA-based array geometry is proposed and presented which can remove this drawback by keeping the simplicity in implementation and analysis. Spectral and numerical evaluation is done on the resolution of both ULA and PA geometries via two well-known AOA estimation algorithms, MUSIC as well as MVDR. Simulation results show that the proposed array resolves narrowband signal sources located at close angles to the array endfire accurately, while having a good resolution in other directions. In addition, to improve the performance of the conventional ULA, the PA presents better accuracy and resolution than the L-shape array in <b>boresight</b> <b>directions.</b> The PA also presents near accuracy to the V-shape array with equal element numbers while having less complexity, computational cost and array aperture size.|$|R

The accuracy and resolution threshold of two well-known AOA estimation algorithms, MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) and Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR), are compared to evaluate the performance of the simple ULA, PA, L-shape and V-shape arrays. Simulation results show higher resolution of both algorithms in new proposed array with respect to the conventional ULA. The PA also performs better than the L-shape array in <b>boresight</b> <b>directions.</b> It also presents near results to the V-shape array with lower complexity and computational cost. This arrangement only adds two elements to the linear array in the vertical direction. Therefore, complexity and size of the proposed array does not increase too much.|$|R

30|$|The {{scanning}} {{operations of}} the spacecraft were carried out until Dec. 18; it was 1  day {{before the end of}} the experiment when we successfully confirmed the <b>boresight</b> <b>direction</b> of the LIDAR telescope. On the final day of the experiment, December 19, fixed pointing of the spacecraft toward the Earth, the small-angle pointing shift of the ground telescope, and the change in the gain of the LIDAR were successfully achieved. As a result, we confirmed that the laser pulses from the ground were detected with the LIDAR. We have not found any evidence that the ground-based station detected return pulses from the LIDAR; consequently, we could not obtain two-way ranges.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – To {{lower costs}} and reduce latency, {{a network of}} {{adaptive}} array ground stations, distributed across the United States, is considered for the downlink of a polar-orbiting low earth orbiting (LEO) satellite. Assuming the X-band 105 Mbps transmitter of NASA's Earth Observing 1 (EO- 1) satellite with a simple line-of-sight propagation model, the average daily download capacity in bits for a network of adaptive array ground stations is {{compared to that of}} a single 11 m dish in Poker Flats, Alaska. Each adaptive array ground station is assumed to have multiple steerable antennas, either mechanically steered dishes or phased arrays that are mechanically steered in azimuth and electronically steered in elevation. Phased array technologies that are being developed for this application are the space-fed lens (SFL) and the reflectarray. Optimization of the different <b>boresight</b> <b>directions</b> of the phased arrays within a ground station is shown to significantly increase capacity; for example, this optimization quadruples the capacity for a ground station with eight SFLs. Several networks comprising only two to three ground stations are shown to meet or exceed the capacity of the big dish. Cutting the data rate by half, which saves modem costs and increases the coverage area of each ground station, is shown to increase the average daily capacity of the network for some configurations...|$|R

Many exospheric species have been detected by remote sensing, including H and He by Mariner 10, Na, K, and Ca by ground-based observations, and H, Na, Ca, Mg, and Ca+ by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft. Other exospheric species, including Fe, AI, Si, 0, S, Mn, CI, Ti, OH, and their ions, {{are expected to be}} present on the basis of MESSENGER surface measurements and models of Mercury's surface chemistry. Here we report on searches for these species made with the Ultraviolet and Visible Spectrometer (UVVS) channel of the Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer (MASCS). No obvious signatures of the listed species have yet been observed in Mercury's exosphere by the UVVS as of this writing. It is possible that detections are elusive because the optimum regions of the exosphere have not been sampled. The Sun-avoidance constraints on MESSENGER place tight limits on instrument <b>boresight</b> <b>directions,</b> and some regions are probed infrequently. If there are strong spatial gradients in the distribution of weakly emitting species, a high-resolution sampling of specific regions may be required to detect them. Summing spectra over time will also aid in the ability to detect weaker emission. Observations to date nonetheless permit strong upper limits to be placed on the abundances of many undetected species, in some cases as functions of time and space. As those limits are lowered with time, the absence of detections can provide insight into surface composition and the potential source mechanisms of exospheric material...|$|R

40|$|Asymmetries in {{plasma density}} {{irregularity}} generation between the leading and trailing {{edges of the}} large-scale plasma density structures in the high-latitude ionosphere are investigated. A model is developed that evaluates the gradient-drift instability (GDI) growth rate differences across the gradient reversal that is applicable at all propagation directions and for the broad range of altitudes spanning the entire lower ionosphere. In particular, the model describes asymmetries that would be observed by an oblique scanning radar near density structures in the polar cap such as elongated polar patches. The dependencies on the relative orientations between the directions of the gradient reversal, plasma convection, and wave propagation are examined at different altitudinal regions. At all altitudes, the largest asymmetries are expected for observations along the gradient reversals, e. g., when an elongated structure is oriented along the radar <b>boresight.</b> The convection <b>direction</b> that results in the strongest asymmetries exhibits a strong dependence on the altitude, with the optimal convection being parallel to the gradient reversal in the E region, perpendicular to it in the F region, and at some angle between these extremes in the transitional region. Implications for observations of polar patches by oblique scanning radars within the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network are discussed. It is demonstrated that the wave propagation direction relative to the prevalent convection and gradient directions plays a critical role in controlling both the irregularity growth rate and its asymmetries near gradient reversals...|$|R

30|$|All {{users and}} BSs are {{equipped}} with directional antennas with sectorized gain pattern as in [22]. The directivity gain at the BS is taken as a constant Mr for all angles in the main lobe, and another constant mr for the side lobes. Hence, given the beamwidth of the main lobe as θr, the gain function of the BS at angle ψr off the <b>boresight</b> <b>direction</b> can be represented by G_M_r,m_r,θ _r(ψ _r). In the same way, the gain function of the user at an angle ψt off the <b>boresight</b> <b>direction</b> can be denoted by G_M_t,m_t,θ _t(ψ _t), where Mt, mt, and θt are the user parameters. Here, we consider that based on the estimated channel, the reference BS and the typical user can adjust their beam steering angles to achieve the maximum array gains. As a result, the total directivity gain of the desired signal is MrMt. Furthermore, for the lth interference link, {{we assume that the}} angle of departure at the interfering user ψ _t^l and the angle of arrival at the reference BS ψ _r^l are independently and uniformly distributed in (0, 2 π], which results in a gain of G_l=G_M_t,m_t,θ _t (ψ _t^l)G_M_r,m_r,θ _r (ψ _r^l). Hence, the directivity gain in the interference link Gl is a discrete random variable whose probability distribution is given as ak with probability bk (k∈ 1, 2, 3, 4), where a 1 =MrMt, b_ 1 =θ _rθ _t/ 4 π ^ 2, a 2 =Mrmt, b_ 2 =θ _r/ 2 π (1 -θ _t/ 2 π), a 3 =mrMt, b_ 3 = (1 -θ _r/ 2 π)θ _t/ 2 π, a 4 =mrmt, and b_ 4 = (1 -θ _r/ 2 π) (1 -θ _t/ 2 π) [11].|$|E
