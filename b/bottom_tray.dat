Furthermore, drying within small-scale village-based enterprises contributes to rural development. However, most equipment suitable to such operations yields a product of non-uniform quality and shows low levels of energy efficiency. The aim {{of this research was}} to improve the batch uniformity and the energy efficiency of a cabinet dryer suitable for smallholder farmers. Experiments were carried out with the cooperation of a dryer manufacturer and a group of users. On each trial 144. 5 kg of peeled and deseeded litchis were placed at the dryer’s 17 trays, that were stacked atop each other. Moisture content (wet basis) was reduced from 87 to 23 % in about 15. 5 h. It was found that a low-cost modification to the dryer chamber’s air inlet was able to improve heat distribution and increase the uniformity of the fruit’s moisture content.

40|$|The world {{population}} {{is expected to}} reach 10. 5 billion by 2050 and it is estimated that food supplies would need to increase by 60 % to meet the food demand. In densely populated tropical regions of Africa, Asia and the Americas, spoilage due to inadequate drying of crops and aflatoxin contamination results in high postharvest losses (PHL). A preliminary study of maize postharvest practices of smallholder farmers in Kenya and Senegal was conducted in order to determine smallholder post-harvest practices, and the causes and remedies for postharvest losses in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Samples of shelled maize being dried had an average moisture content of 18 % in Kakamega and 25 – 26 % in Velingara. Aflatoxin in maize was found above the action level (20 ppb) in 14 % of the samples in Velingara, while 20 % of samples in Kakamega showed 1 - 6 ppb of aflatoxin. 72 % of surveyed farmers in Kakamega and 26 % in Velingara mentioned rain as the biggest challenge during drying of maize. Other major problems faced by the farmers during crop drying were birds and livestock eating grain, spillage, contamination from dust and rodents. ^ Analyses from the surveys provided insight on technical approaches for drying that would be most likely to be adopted in both the communities. This work further involved the design, development and testing of solar dryer prototypes. FLUENT analysis of the first dryer prototype as well as lack of uniform drying of maize indicated need for improvement in airflow inside the dryer. Addition of six exhaust fans on the floor and two inlet fans in the back, along with two fans in the front, showed better and consistent airflow. The second dryer prototypes were fabricated accordingly and tested with field drying experiments of maize in different geographical locations - West Lafayette, Kenya and Senegal. The field test was a comparative analysis of maize drying using the multipurpose solar dryer with open-air sun drying on the drying trays and a tarp, respectively. The <b>bottom</b> <b>trays</b> inside the dryer and open-air trays dried maize at significantly faster rates compared to upper dryer trays and tarp in almost every experiment. The thermal efficiency of the solar dryer on first days of drying in the three locations ranged from 23 – 65 %, 31 – 50 % and 33 – 65 %, respectively, depending on the loads and initial moisture content of grain. An average rise of 5 – 7 °C (maximum up to 11 °C) above the ambient temperature was observed during the experiments. ...|$|R

500|$|The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is {{cultivated}} {{by similar}} methods but in larger volumes {{and in many}} more regions of the world. This oyster originated in Japan {{where it has been}} cultivated for many centuries. It is an estuarine species and prefers salinities of 20 to 25 parts per thousand. Breeding programmes have produced improved stock that is available from hatcheries. A single female oyster can produce 50–80 million eggs in a batch so the selection of broodstock is of great importance. The larvae are grown on in tanks of static or moving water. They are fed high quality microalgae and diatoms and grow fast. At metamorphosis the juveniles may be allowed to settle on PVC sheets or pipes, or crushed shell. In some cases, they continue their development in [...] "upwelling culture" [...] in large tanks of moving water rather than being allowed to settle on the bottom. They then may be transferred to transitional, nursery beds before being moved to their final rearing quarters. Culture there takes place on the <b>bottom,</b> in plastic <b>trays,</b> in mesh bags, on rafts or on long lines, either in shallow water or in the intertidal zone.

The technique was developed based on, and has been successfully applied to samples in southern Taiwan. The technique was revised by expanding the distribution of samples from 216 sites/ 10 farmers in the south to 342 sites/ 17 farmers on the whole island. TMR of an adequate slimness was produced from baled hay using a multi-purpose TMR truck. The product was examined using a ψ 3. 81 cm screen on the top followed by the upper screen (ψl. 90 cm) and the <b>bottom</b> <b>tray</b> of the standard Penn State particle separator. The probability of the product with a particle size between 10 - 15 cm was higher than 90 %. The screw drill operated at a speed fluctuating less than 10 % and at a load varying less than 5 %. These operation parameters indicate that the machine was operating at a stable condition. The TMR product has a content of effective fiber between 10 - 20 % and the coefficients of variance of the homogeneity and the content of salt were less than 10 %. This is considered as good. The result is identical to the use of a Penn State fourlayer push-pull separator or a Penn State threelayer manual separator. There is no significant difference between silage and forage TMRs when the three-layer handle is applied, especially the middle screen (0. 8 ≦ψ≦l. 9 cm). The result shows that the technique, which was developed based on dairy farmers in southern Taiwan, can be applied to all dairy farmers on the island. In practical applications, the technique can be applied on line for material selection and machine tuning to produce a TMR with an adequate effective-fiber content and homogeneity for optimal cow feeding. 本研究將原本僅適用於南部地區的既有完全混合日糧(TMR) 有效纖維量與均勻度檢測技術進行適域化與全區化，採樣區擴及中北部與東部，由 10 樣本戶 216 採樣點增至 17 樣本戶 342 採樣點。驗證採兼用型TMR機細切圓形乾草包，用於調製適當細切長度的TMR。採用兼用型TMR機進行原車細切調製，成品檢測採用ψ 3. 81 cm頂段篩結合Penn State三段篩的上段篩(ψ 1. 90 cm) 與底段箱。細切長度維持在 10 - 15 cm的機率達 90 %以上；細切圓形乾草包作業時，螺旋鑽運轉數度維持於± 10 %的變動率內；細切的重量負載變動維持於± 5 %，表現出穩定的機械運轉；所調製的TMR有效纖維量在 10 - 20 %間；均勻度的變異，與食鹽成分的變異係數(CV) 對照，均在 10 %內，屬優質的範圍。當以Penn State四層式推拉篩動或三層式手搖篩動方式處理時，並無顯著的差異。對於新鮮與烘乾的TMR，採用三層式手搖篩動，也無顯著的差異，尤以中段篩(0. 8 ≦ψ≦ 1. 9 cm) 更為明確。測試結果顯示所建立的南區檢測技術可以應用於台灣全區的酪農：適宜的檢測技術是以新鮮TMR，利用三層式手搖篩動，依指標值判定TMR的有效纖維量與均勻度，結果反饋於原料及機械操控的調整改善，以達理想的餵飼需求...|$|E

5000|$|The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is {{cultivated}} {{by similar}} methods but in larger volumes {{and in many}} more regions of the world. This oyster originated in Japan {{where it has been}} cultivated for many centuries. It is an estuarine species and prefers salinities of 20 to 25 parts per thousand. Breeding programmes have produced improved stock that is available from hatcheries. A single female oyster can produce 50-80 million eggs in a batch so the selection of broodstock is of great importance. The larvae are grown on in tanks of static or moving water. They are fed high quality microalgae and diatoms and grow fast. At metamorphosis the juveniles may be allowed to settle on PVC sheets or pipes, or crushed shell. In some cases, they continue their development in [...] "upwelling culture" [...] in large tanks of moving water rather than being allowed to settle on the bottom. They then may be transferred to transitional, nursery beds before being moved to their final rearing quarters. Culture there takes place on the <b>bottom,</b> in plastic <b>trays,</b> in mesh bags, on rafts or on long lines, either in shallow water or in the intertidal zone. The oysters are ready for harvesting in 18 to 30 months depending on the size required.|$|R

Their influence on paper machine wet end operations was investigated. The improved defoamer dosing procedure was examined at UMP-Kymmene Tervasaari PM 8. Air content and its controlling methods at the paper machine were studied in the literature survey. Also the influence of dissolved gases and entrained air in the papermaking furnish were introduced. Feeding methods – a TrumpJet chemical mixer and traditional feeding devices – were reviewed. The defoamer’s functioning methods were studied. The influence {{of the use of}} defoamers was estimated based on the main selected wet end operations. In the experimental part, defoamer mixing with a traditional feeding method and two improved mixing stages were compared based on the air content profiles in PM 8 ’s approach system. The reference dosage procedure was PM 8 ’s old dosing system. The first dosage procedure in the comparison involved two TrumpJet chemical mixers installed on the <b>bottom</b> wire <b>trays.</b> The second element of comparison involved the improvement brought by a third TrumpJet chemical mixer installed on the top wire tray. This second comparison of the efficient defoamer feeding concept was made at a higher production speed of PM 8. The air content control situation was also studied at the higher production speed. In addition the connection between the defoamer and air content was observed and a mill-scale system was studied. The economical benefits of the new dosing procedure were also reviewed. Air content profiles of short circulation were measured in the reference situation and the two comparison points of the study. These air content measurements proved the main gas load is introduced to PM 8 's paper furnish from the white water tray. Thick stock air content was not essential when the air volume flow was considered. The improved defoamer dosing procedure made lower dosage amounts possible. Compared with the traditional feeding system, the new defoamer feeding concept made only few direct improvements to the wet end operations and the produced paper itself. The lower defoamer need was noticed to have a positive influence on hydrophobic sizing and paper defects. The surfaces of the white water tanks and the operation of pumps were assessed based on the density variations of the suspension.

30|$|The {{original}} RIL {{population was}} derived from a cross of IR 29 with “Pokkali B” made at IRRI in 1992 (IR 66946). Subsequently, seeds of the Pokkali parent used in the cross were deposited in the IRRI Genebank in 2003 (IRGC 108921). The original population consisted of 276 F 8 RILs (Gregorio 1997), and a subset of 140 lines was selected for the current study. The population was evaluated for seedling stage salinity tolerance using a hydroponic system under controlled conditions of 29 / 21 °C day/night temperature, natural sunlight and 70 % RH in the IRRI phytotron in April 2006 (Experiment 1) and November 2006 (Experiment 2). Pre-germinated seeds were sown in holes on styrofoam floats with a net <b>bottom</b> suspended on <b>trays</b> filled with Yoshida nutrient solution (Yoshida et al. 1976). Three replications were used for each experiment, with nine individual plants per line evaluated for each replication. For Experiment 1, salt stress was imposed 14  days after germination by adding NaCl to an EC of 12  dS m− 1 in Yoshida nutrient solution until final scoring. For Experiment 2, 5 -day-old seedlings were salinized to EC 6  dS m− 1 for 5  days, then EC 12  dS m− 1 for 5  days, followed by EC of 18  dS m− 1 until the final scoring. IR 29 (sensitive) and FL 478 (highly tolerant) were used as checks. The pH of the nutrient solution was adjusted daily to 5.0, and the culture solutions were replaced weekly. Entries were scored based on visual symptoms using IRRI’s SES for rice, with ratings from 1 (highly tolerant) to 9 (highly sensitive; IRRI 1996). In addition, Na+ and K+ concentrations in leaves and roots, seedling height and chlorophyll content in leaves were assessed.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the trial}} in October and November 1981 of Taub and Kunz, Taub told the court—as {{reported}} by The Baltimore Sun—that the monkeys had been given [...] "gentle" [...] treatment, and had {{what he called a}} [...] "remarkable record of health." [...] He acknowledged that they had not been seen by a veterinarian in the previous two years, because he was an expert himself in the treatment of deafferented monkeys. Responding to the images of the monkeys with open sores and decaying bandages, he said that using salves, ointments, and bandages is more dangerous than leaving the conditions untreated; monkeys feel no pain from the deafferented limbs and learn to ignore them, he said, whereas drawing attention to the wounds with salves or bandages would cause the animals to bite or claw at them. Bandages might be necessary where the wounds had grown out of control, or where there was massive infection, and it was sometimes better to let the bandages deteriorate, he said. Taub also testified that some of the photographs Pacheco took had been staged for dramatic effect. Norman Doidge wrote in 2007 that, according to Taub, the monkeys in the photographs had been placed in positions that were not part of the laboratory procedure, a claim Pacheco denied. As for the dirt, Taub said [...] "monkey rooms are dirty places," [...] and that it was normal in laboratories for fecal matter to lie on the floor and food to drop through the cage <b>bottoms</b> into waste <b>trays.</b> He said employees had used brooms and mops on the floor, and had emptied the waste trays nearly every day. He said the monkeys had been given fresh fruit twice a week, and that he disagreed with the veterinarians who testified for the prosecution that the female monkey, Sarah, was underweight.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The forest {{residuals}} play {{an important}} role in runoff rate, soil erosion, and soil infiltration capacity of protecting mineral (surface) soils from the direct impact of raindrops. By intercepting rainfall, the forest residuals serve as a temporary reservoir and allows more time for infiltration into the mineral soil beneath (Kosugi et al., 2001). Hydraulic properties of forest residuals were unknown to some extent and could not be measured with similar methods used for mineral soil. In recent years, several studies on the forest floor have been published (Kosugi et al., 2001; Schaap et al., 1997). The objective of this study was the comparison of accuracy of van Genuchten and Brooks & Corey models for simulating water flow in forest floor using the HydroGeoSphere Code of broad-leaved, needle-leaved and mixed-stand floor. First, saturated hydraulic conductivity, porosity, and water retention curve parameters (van Genuchten equation) which were unknown parameters in the forest floor were estimated by inverse method. Second, estimated hydraulic properties were compared statistically. Materials and methods: Forest floor samples were collected from broad-leaved (beech and others), needle-leaved (coniferous) and mixed-stand (coniferous and broad-leaved) trees in Guilan province, Iran. In the laboratory, a plastic wire-netting, composed of 0. 3 mm diameter was attached to the bottom of each core sample to support forest floor. Then the samples were piled up to make long columns of 18. 1 cm in inner diameter and about 40. 88 cm in height. Artificial rainfall experiments were conducted on top of the columns and free drainage from the bottom of columns was measured in the laboratory. Applied rainfall intensities were randomly changed in the range of 0 - 0. 01 cm/sec. Drainage at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>tray</b> was collected and measured using an electronic balance. First, a constant intense rain was applied to reach to steady state condition as a constant discharge rate from the bottom was established in order to accurately define the initial condition required for the numerical simulation of unsaturated water flow. After reaching to state steady experiment, transient condition was carried out. In transient condition, the random rainfall experiment was conducted and the transient discharge rate from the bottom was continuously monitored. In this study, we developed an inverse method for estimating parameters based on the Levenberg-Marquardt (Marquardt 1963) minimization algorithm in the C++ programming language along with HydroGeoSphere (Therrien et al., 2008) as a forward model. The model was used to address two specific issues. First, it was used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity, porosity, and soil water retention curve parameters (van Genuchten and Brooks & Cory equations) which were unknown parameters in the unsaturated porous media. Second the water flow in the forest floor was simulated using van Genuchten and Brooks & Cory equations along with HydroGeoSphere code. Results and discussion: The results of calibration periods showed that the estimated free drainage using the optimized parameters exhibits a good fitting with the observed free drainage for all treatments. The good agreement between simulated and observed free drainage in the validation period for all the forest floor samples illustrated that the estimated hydraulic properties efficiently characterized the unsaturated water flow in forest floor. So one could conclude that Richards' equation along with Brooks & Cory and van Genuchten's retention functions can successfully describe the unsaturated water flow in the forest floors. Estimated hydraulic properties succeeded to reproduce the observed free drainage in the transient condition, indicating van Genuchten functions along with Richards' equation can be used to simulate water flow in the entire forest floors. The results of the study showed that the forest floor samples have large saturated hydraulic conductivity values like light soils. The results showed that inverse method was not sensitive to residual water content. Also the results showed that HydroGeoSphere code along with van Genuchten's retention function with 0. 2753 mimics free drainage better than Brooks & Corey's retention function with 0. 3400 but there is no significant difference (...|$|R
