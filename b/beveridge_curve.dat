40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{empirical}} analysis of unemployment {{patterns in the}} OECD countries from the 1960 s to the 1990 s, looking at the <b>Beveridge</b> <b>Curves,</b> real wages as well as unemployment directly. Our results indicate the following. First, the <b>Beveridge</b> <b>Curves</b> of all the countries except Norway and Sweden shifted to the right from the 1960 s to the early/mid 1980 s. At this point, the countries divide into two distinct groups. Those whose <b>Beveridge</b> <b>Curves</b> continued to shift out and those where they started to shift back. Second, we find evidence that these movements in the <b>Beveridge</b> <b>Curves</b> may be partly explained by changes in labour market institutions, particularly those which are important for search and matching efficiency. Third, labour market institutions impact on real labour costs in a fashion which is broadly consistent with their impact on unemployment. Finally, broad movements in unemployment across the OECD {{can be explained by}} shifts in labour market institutions although this explanation relies on high levels of endogenous persistence as reflected in a lagged dependent variable coefficient of around 0. 85...|$|R

This paper uses data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) labour force surveys and vacancies surveys to study the relationship between job vacancies and unemployment over the period 1983 - 2005.

50|$|The {{frictions}} in {{the labor}} market are sometimes illustrated graphically with a <b>Beveridge</b> <b>curve,</b> a downward-sloping, convex curve that shows a fixed relationship between the unemployment rate on one axis and the vacancy rate on the other. Changes in the supply of or demand for labor cause movements along this curve. An increase in labor market frictions will shift the curve outwards, and vice versa. A longer term form of frictional unemployment is structural unemployment which is very similar.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Beveridge</b> <b>curve,</b> or UV-curve, is a {{graphical}} {{representation of the}} relationship between unemployment and the job vacancy rate (the number of unfilled jobs expressed as a proportion of the labor force). It typically has vacancies on the vertical axis and unemployment on the horizontal. The curve is named after William Beveridge and it is hyperbolic shaped and slopes downwards as a higher rate of unemployment normally occurs with a lower rate of vacancies. If it moves outwards over time, then a given level of vacancies would be associated with higher and higher levels of unemployment, which would imply decreasing efficiency in the labour market. Inefficient labour markets are due to mismatches between available jobs and the unemployed and an immobile labour force.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Beveridge</b> <b>curve,</b> or UV-curve, was {{developed}} in 1958 by Christopher Dow and Leslie Arthur Dicks-Mireaux. They were interested in measuring excess demand in the goods market for the guidance of Keynesian fiscal policies and took British data on vacancies and unemployment in the labour market as a proxy, since excess demand is unobservable. By 1958 they had twelve years time series data available since the British Government had started collecting data on unfilled vacancies from notification at labour exchanges in 1946. Dow and Dicks-Mireaux presented the unemployment and vacancy data in an unemployment-vacancy (UV) space, and derived an idealized UV-curve as a rectangular hyperbola after they had connected successive observations. The UV-curve, or Beveridge-curve, enabled economists to employ an analytical method—which later became known as UV-analysis—for the decomposition of unemployment into different types of unemployment: into deficient-demand (or cyclical) unemployment and structural unemployment. In {{the first half of}} the 1970s this method was refined by economists of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) in London, so that a classification arose that corresponded to the ‘traditional’ classification: a division of unemployment into frictional, structural, and deficient demand unemployment. Both the Beveridge-curve and the Phillips-curve bear implicit macroeconomic notions of equilibrium in markets, though these notions are inconsistent and conflicting. Most likely because the Beveridge-curve enabled economists to analyze many of the problems Beveridge addressed, such as, mismatch between unemployment and vacancies, both at aggregate level and industry levels, trend versus cyclical changes and measurement problems of vacancies, the curve was named in the 1980s after William Beveridge. Beveridge, however, never drew the curve and the exact origin of the name remains obscure.|$|E

30|$|In this section, we further analyze which {{factors have}} contributed to the changes in the <b>Beveridge</b> <b>curves</b> for the {{relevant}} sectors of the economy. As mentioned in the Introduction, structural changes can be a result of either decreasing matching efficiency or increasing separation rates. In this section, we establish which of these factors may {{have contributed to}} the sectoral changes. We follow the methodology of Elsby et al. (2013) (also used by Arpaia et al. (2014)) to analyze the development of matching efficiency and separation rates for those sectors of the economy for which the <b>Beveridge</b> <b>curves</b> have shifted. In the first step, we apply the procedure introduced by Shimer (2012) to find the outflow rates of unemployment for each sector. The job-finding rate is calculated based on the AMS data regarding the duration of unemployment by category: (a) less than 3 months; (b) between 3 and 6 months; (c) between 6 and 12 months; and (d) more than 12 months. Secondly, we evaluate the separation rates, based on the steady-state condition derived from Eq. (1) and assuming a Cobb–Douglas matching function.|$|R

40|$|In {{his recent}} study Blanchard (1989) investigates {{the nature and}} origin of {{persistent}} unemployment by a joint examination of {{the movements of the}} Phillips and <b>Beveridge</b> <b>curves.</b> According to Blanchard, the persistence of unemployment can be associated either with the reallocation or the bargaining factors, depending upon the degree of correlation between the shifts in the Phillips and Beveridge curves: If both curves shift simultaneously this provides support for the reallocation explanation of the rise in the non-accelerating rate of unemployment; if the shifts are not correlated, this implies that the bargaining factors explain the persistence of high unemployment. The aim of the present study is to investigate the usefulness of the testing methodology proposed and employed in Blanchard's study. This is done by examining the robustnesses of the results derived from such an analysis with respect to various specifications of the Phillips and <b>Beveridge</b> <b>curves</b> and different time periods. The analysis is carried out by using aggregate data on the Finnish economy from the period 1960 - 1987. The main result of the study is that no precise conclusions can be obtained by employing the proposed research strategy. ...|$|R

30|$|One {{additional}} {{inspection of}} the series comes from the relationship between vacancies and unemployment—the so-called Beveridge curve—useful to identify structural changes in labor markets. The theory behind <b>Beveridge</b> <b>curves</b> predicts a negative-sloping relationship. During economic downturns vacancies tend to decrease and unemployment to rise. The opposite happens during economic booms. Moreover, the theory also suggests that the relationship could shift due to structural changes. Estimating the slope and the intercept of the relationship and their changes over time helps interpreting the driving forces of the labor market.|$|R
