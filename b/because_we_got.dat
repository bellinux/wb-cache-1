The name [...] "taser" [...] was originally [...] "TSER", for [...] "Tom Swift Electric Rifle". The invention was named for the central device in the story Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle (1911); according to inventor Jack Cover, [...] "an 'A' was added <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> tired of answering the phone 'TSER.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Moore {{considered}} {{the writing of}} Blood to be harder compared to previous OSI albums. Previously, Matheos would send Moore guitar parts to work with, allowing Moore to [...] "work with editing them, pitching them, and fucking about them different ways, and then programming drums and keyboards." [...] When working on Blood, Matheos also provided programming, keyboard and drum parts. [...] "If he sent me stuff that already had drums and keyboard parts, and it wasn't a complete idea, I {{had to figure out}} a way to elaborate on it without having that same equipment that he has there," [...] Moore said. Overall, he {{considered the}} writing process to be [...] "smoother <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> on a roll and we're more fluid together".|$|E
500|$|Following the race, which {{experienced}} a record 16cautions and 74 lead changes, among 22 different drivers, Edwards commented, [...] "A new winner, up-and-coming guy that's tied {{to so much}} history. This {{is as good as}} it gets. If people aren't watching, that's their problem, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> some great stuff going on here." [...] In the post-race press conference, the third-place finisher, Gilliland, said, [...] "It's a credit to NASCAR and their new rules, trying to get the (cars) closer, to let teams like us have a chance to be competitive. A lot of the rules (are) making these races more competitive." [...] Jeff Gordon also commented about Bayne, [...] "I think it's very cool. Trevor's a good kid, and I love the Wood Brothers. I'm really happy for him. And I think it's great for the sport. To have a young talent like that– he's got that spark, you know?" ...|$|E

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{of the basic}} instrumental tracks for Wrapped in Red took place in Kurstin's Echo Studio in Los Angeles while orchestral sessions were recorded at EastWest Studios in Hollywood and featured vocals recorded in The Barn studio in Nashville. In recording tracks for the album, Clarkson and Kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh, contemporary sound to classic-sounding music. Kurstin recalled: [...] "It {{was a lot of}} fun for us <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to go back to our roots. When Kelly started singing, it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything." [...] He further added: [...] "We really experimented. It was so much fun and liberating. And it pays off." [...] Kurstin, who studied with jazz musician Jaki Byard at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as James Gadson, Kevin Dukes, Roy McCurdy, and Bill Withers to perform on the record to resonate a Memphis soul sound. He also collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra.|$|E
500|$|Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode a 4.6 out of 5 stars, {{and went on}} to {{describe}} the episode as [...] "A funny, touching, entertaining Glee episode that didn't feature a single line from Sue Sylvester? I never thought I'd see the day. But that's exactly what transpired on 'Silly Love Songs', as the show stopped feeling like a Public Service Announcement for a week and actually focused on well-paced, well-written relationship developments among its core characters." [...] Joel Keller of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, and wrote, Silly Love Songs' strikes an interesting contrast to Sunday night's post-Super Bowl episode in that tonight was more about the kids and where they are in their stories than about big production numbers and Sue's cartoon evilness. It was also the funniest episode of the season, in no small part <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> some insight into the lives of two New Directions members we rarely get to hang out with for any length of time: Santana and Lauren." [...] James Poniewozik of Time Magazine praised the storyline and the musical performances of the episode. However, Soraya Roberts of the Daily News gave the episode a negative review: [...] "This show sometimes sounds like it was written by a PIT, prime idiot TV writer. It's almost as bad as Tina breaking down into tears for no reason while singing 'My Funny Valentine' to Mike and Blaine attempting to channel Frank Sinatra while singing Paul McCartney's 'Silly Love Songs' in the middle of Breadsticks." [...] Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post praised the storyline, calling it cohesive.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, aged 17, Tyler {{spent time}} in Greenwich Village, New York, the {{highlight}} of which was seeing a Rolling Stones concert. Tyler states that his friends and he [...] "hung around for a while, buzzing like crazy just <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to touch them."

5000|$|Mangione has {{described}} the process of composing the instrumental's music, saying that his [...] "vision was {{to think about the}} athletes and their efforts to do their best now. They're giving it all they've <b>got.</b> And <b>we</b> almost <b>got</b> to be like the athletes <b>because</b> <b>we</b> also <b>got</b> to perform the song at the ceremonies for a worldwide audience." ...|$|R

2500|$|Charlie Bachman, in {{his first}} game as Michigan State's head coach, used a passing game to attempt a comeback. [...] The Spartans {{completed}} five of 18 passes for 74 yards. [...] The Wolverines completed one of four passes. [...] After the game, Bachman told reporters: [...] "I am pleased with the outcome of the game, despite the loss, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> rid of that inferiority complex with Michigan. [...] My two sophomore backs [...] [...] [...] played as if they never heard of Michigan. [...] To them, Michigan was just another football team." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{crowd of}} over 500,000 people turned {{out on the}} streets of Manchester to greet the players, who paraded through the city in an open-top bus. As European champions, United were invited to play in the Intercontinental Cup. The club also entered the inaugural Club World Championship, which was held in Brazil. This brought about a {{potential}} fixture congestion so United accepted the FA's recommendation of withdrawing from the FA Cup, the first holders to do so. In later years, Ferguson elaborated on the club's decision: [...] "We did it to help England’s World Cup bid. That was the political situation. I regretted it <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> nothing but stick and terrible criticism for not being in the FA Cup when really, it wasn’t our fault." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of Romário's best {{performances}} was {{scoring a}} hat-trick in the memorable 5–0 win over Real Madrid in the El Clásico at the Camp Nou, with the spectacular opening goal seeing him drag the ball around the defender without it leaving his foot before finishing with a trademark toe-poke {{into the corner}} of the net. His highlight for Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League came in the two games against Manchester United where he nutmegged Peter Schmeichel to score at Old Trafford, and scored again in the 4–0 win at the Camp Nou in front of 114,000 fans. Reflecting on the game at the Camp Nou, Manchester United captain Steve Bruce, who played in defence that night, states: “Of all the great things that happened during my career, the thing that sticks out the most is that night <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> our backsides kicked big-style. Stoichkov and Romário are still etched in my memory, especially Romário, who was arguably the best player I ever faced." ...|$|E

[...] The back of his leg is decorated with the coordinates of his hometown's Plaza de España.|$|R
2500|$|Basically, they [...] {{wanted us}} to re-sign and do a new {{contract}} before our old one was done and we didn't want to do that. We wanted to fulfil our original contract {{and then go on}} from there because {{there were a number of}} labels that were interested in working with us. [...] We were playing hardball back and forth with the label and that's why that record ... it was a difficult period for us. We were all pretty pissed off and angry and that shows in the music. Our budget got slashed for that record just because of the fact that we had not re-signed. I think it came down to [...] "Well, re-sign now or this is your budget because that's what is says in your contract." [...] You can't argue with that. We didn't re-sign. We didn't buckle under and I think it paid off in the end <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> what we wanted [...] We got everything that we wanted in our new record deal ... everything that we've worked ten fucking years for and deserve, we got. We learned how to play the game and we played it very well.|$|E
2500|$|The tour notably {{promoted}} Justin Timberlake and Usher when Jackson selected both as {{its opening}} acts during their early careers, exposing {{them to a}} wider audience. Both artists credit Jackson as a major showmanship influence from both [...] "an entertainment and evolution perspective." [...] While Timberlake was part of 'N Sync, Jackson personally selected them to open for the tour, helping to introduce the relatively unknown group to the public. Timberlake said [...] "I had her poster on my wall so I'm psyched", later describing the experience as [...] "fulfilling." [...] Jackson performed with the group on several dates, including joining them for a live a cappella rendition of Stevie Wonder's [...] "Overjoyed." [...] A biography stated it was a [...] "highlight" [...] moment for Timberlake which [...] "gave Justin {{a chance to show}} his family and friends how far he had come." [...] The tour was the largest audience the group performed for at the time; JC Chasez commenting [...] "That was great <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to see how a real professional tours. And not only that she is really sweet. We really enjoyed it." [...] Chris Kirkpatrick added, [...] "She is very good at entertaining. We learned a lot — that if people want to hear just the music, they can buy the CD. But it's the whole live aspect of changing the songs every night or the whole theatrical performance that she puts on. She's definitely one of our mentors when it comes to touring and the stage show. Her show told a story, and that's what people like to see." [...] Timberlake was previously inspired to become a performer after attending Jackson's Rhythm Nation Tour, saying [...] "She didn't just stand there and sing her song", fascinated by her [...] "energy and exuberance". A friend commented [...] "He was always into Janet." [...] Author Sean Smith stated, [...] "Much has been made of Michael Jackson's influence on Justin's music, but he is only {{one of a number of}} influential artists who have shaped the musical style of Mr. JT, and he is not even the most influential member of the Jackson clan. That accolade firmly belongs to Janet Jackson", who was [...] "one of the most successful artists of the last twenty years." [...] Following the tour, Timberlake and Jackson became [...] "good friends", ultimately leading to Timberlake performing alongside Jackson during a segment of Jackson's controversial Super Bowl Halftime Show performance. Usher described opening for Jackson as [...] "the biggest event" [...] of his career and an [...] "honor", saying [...] "She's a definite entertainer, works hard and sweats every night. I learned a lot about how to make an artist look like a star." [...] Nick Lachey and group 98 Degrees opened for several dates and experienced increased commercial success following the tour. Upon the release of Never Gone, AJ McLean of the Backstreet Boys described his hair as resembling [...] "Janet Jackson on the Velvet Rope Tour." ...|$|E

60|$|We do {{not have}} any of that {{nonsense}} in England <b>because</b> <b>we</b> have never attempted to have any of that philosophy in England. And, above all, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> have the enormous advantage of feeling it natural to be national, because there is nothing else to be. England in these days is not well governed; England is not well educated; England suffers from wealth and poverty that are not well distributed. But England is English; esto perpetua. England is English as France is French or Ireland Irish; the great mass of men taking certain national traditions for granted. Now this gives us a totally different and a very much easier task. <b>We</b> have not <b>got</b> an inquisition, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> have not <b>got</b> a creed; but it is arguable that we do not need a creed, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> a character. In any of the old nations the national unity is preserved by the national type. <b>Because</b> <b>we</b> have a type we do not need to have a test.|$|R
6000|$|I try to {{give the}} thing a quiet, matter-of-fact air. [...] "You see," [...] I say, in the tone one adopts for really lucid explanations, [...] "we come from another world. Consequently, {{whatever}} thumb-mark registration or numbering you have in this planet doesn't apply to us, and we don't know our numbers <b>because</b> <b>we</b> haven't <b>got</b> any. <b>We</b> are really, you know, explorers, strangers----" ...|$|R

Anyhow we may as well keep our eyes open till we know the place is clear." ...|$|R
60|$|WE had {{powerful}} good luck; <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> {{a chance}} in a stern-wheeler from away North which was bound {{for one of them}} bayous or one-horse rivers away down Louisiana way, and so we could go {{all the way down the}} Upper Mississippi and all the way down the Lower Mississippi to that farm in Arkansaw without having to change steamboats at St. Louis; not so very much short of a thousand miles at one pull.|$|E
60|$|If {{this is true}} for men, it is {{much more}} true for women. Teach a woman to act from an idea, and you destroy her womanhood for ever. Make a woman self-conscious, and her soul is barren as a sandbag. Why were we driven out of Paradise? Why did we fall into this gnawing disease of unappeasable dissatisfaction? Not because we sinned. Ah, no. All the animals in Paradise enjoyed the sensual passion of coition. Not because we sinned. But <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> our sex into our head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Allenwood {{has been}} a success," [...] said Broadwood; [...] "one can't deny it--but I think we owe a good deal to our having settled {{in a new and}} undeveloped country. The {{experiment}} turned out well <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the land cheap and wheat was dear. Now I foresee a sharp fall in prices, {{and it seems to me}} that we may have to revise our methods to suit the times. In future, we may find it difficult to live upon our farms unless we work them properly. I'm afraid we can't stand still while Canada moves on--and I'm not sure that it's a great misfortune." ...|$|E

60|$|Would it be {{difficult}} to find such lecturers as you speak of?--Not in time; perhaps at present it would be, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> so much in the habit of thinking that science consists in language, and in fine words, and not in ascertaining the nature of the thing. The workman cannot be deceived by fine words; he always wants to know something about the thing, and its properties. Many of our lecturers would, I have no doubt, be puzzled if they were asked to explain the habits of a common bird.|$|R
500|$|Satisfied was {{released}} through Slanted Records on August 26, 2008, and debuted {{at its peak}} positions of number 116 on the Billboard 200 and number three on the Billboard Top Christian Albums charts. [...] First week sales nearly doubled those of DecembeRadio. [...] The album cover {{was the product of}} a spontaneous suggestion from the band's manager on the day of a photoshoot. [...] Another photo had been slated for the album cover, but the band found a swamp and acted on their manager's idea. [...] "We went down there, took off our shoes, rolled up our jeans a little bit and walked right into the water—and stood there for 45 minutes while <b>we</b> <b>got</b> our picture taken. It's a good thing <b>we</b> did it <b>because</b> when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the pictures back, those were by far our favorite!" [...] said Bunn.|$|R

5000|$|Arcade Fire {{is among}} the bands most {{commonly}} cited to have benefited from a Pitchfork review. In a 2005 Chicago Tribune article, a Merge Records employee states, [...] "After the Pitchfork review, Funeral went out of print {{for about a week}} <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> so many orders for the record." ...|$|E
5000|$|Media {{attention}} has proven embarrassing to school officials, and the embarrassment {{has resulted in}} changes to state laws {{as well as to}} local school policies.

On the contrary I knew quite well that--acting from the best of motives--you advised Luke to fly from justice, since in your opinion his condemnation is a foregone conclusion. Father hadn't the chance of passing your advice on to Luke, <b>because</b> when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to Fairfax Mansions, Edie {{told us that he}} was packing up his things, meaning to catch the night boat to Calais." ...|$|R
5000|$|We had the Rolling Stones mobile {{recording}} unit sitting {{outside in the}} snow, but to get there we had to run cable through two doors in the corridor into a room, through a bathroom and into another room, from which it went across a bed and out the veranda window, then ran along the balcony for about 100 feet and came back in through another bedroom window. It then went through that rooms bathroom and into another corridor, then {{all the way down}} a marble staircase to the foyer reception area of the hotel, out the front door, across the courtyard and up the steps {{into the back of the}} mobile unit. I think that setup led to capturing some spontaneity, <b>because</b> once <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to the truck for a playback, even if we didnt think it was a perfect take, wed go, Yeah, thats good enough. <b>Because</b> <b>we</b> just couldnt stand going back again.

2500|$|One element Gerson Saines {{was sure}} about from the {{beginning}} was {{that she wanted to}} work with HBO, in part because of her longstanding relationship with the network through her work as an agent. [...] "But I also knew that by going that route, more people will see it," [...] she said. [...] "When you're trying to make a movie like this, it's very rare that it reaches a wide audience." [...] HBO was equally intrigued by the story, and Gerson Saines credits past and present HBO executives with keeping the project alive until it could be properly realized.
