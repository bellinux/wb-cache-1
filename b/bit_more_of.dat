5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} {{an early version}} of it that was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead turned it into a pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she wanted it to be just like Shear's version, with a <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an acoustic sound. However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E

500|$|... "A Little Bit" [...] {{was written}} by Kara DioGuardi, Steve Morales and David Siegal, and was {{produced}} by Morales and Ric Wake. The song became DioGuardi's first writing credit for an artist from her native country. Simpson's vocals were recorded by Dan Hetzel at Sony Music Studios, New York City, and the track was mixed by Hetzel along with Richie Jones at Cove City Sound Studios, Glen Cove, New York. Keyboard programming was done by Eric Kupper. According to Simpson, [...] "the message behind the song is for guys {{to listen to the}} girl". [...] "A guy needs to give a little <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> himself, a little <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> his time. It's about the love going so much further, the guy would actually be selfless," [...] she expanded on the song's theme. In the United States, [...] "A Little Bit" [...] was released as the second single from Irresistible. The song saw an airplay-only release there, while in Australia, a physical single was issued on October29,2001. [...] "A Little Bit" [...] was used to promote Bally Total Fitness and thus, a limited CD single pressing was made available to people who joined the club. The song was also utilized for the company's promotional advertisement campaign.|$|E

Being on DVD format, the incentive over the VHS version is one of picture quality. However, due to the rarity of some Tiswas material (many episodes surviving only on off-air recordings) there is some understandably rough-looking footage here and there.

500|$|... "You" [...] {{is a song}} by English {{musician}} George Harrison, {{released as}} the opening track of his 1975 album Extra Texture (Read All About It). It was also the album's lead single, becoming a top 20 hit in America and reaching number 9 in Canada. A 45-second instrumental portion of the song, titled [...] "A <b>Bit</b> <b>More</b> <b>of</b> You", appears on Extra Texture also, opening side two of the original LP format. Harrison wrote [...] "You" [...] in 1970 as a song for Ronnie Spector, formerly of the Ronettes, and wife of Harrison's All Things Must Pass co-producer Phil Spector. The composition reflects Harrison's admiration for 1960s American soul/R, particularly Motown.|$|E
500|$|The {{series has}} {{received}} mixed critical reception; About.com's Nancy Basile gave the series {{four out of}} five stars, opining that the series is [...] "what Adult Swim should be ... experimental, but in a cheap, simple, not-trying-to-be-cool way." [...] She found the crude animation [...] "refreshing" [...] but joked that the series [...] "can kill" [...] viewers not used to the slow pace. Writing for AOL TV, Adam Finley regarded the show as [...] "the most simplistically drawn of all the Adult Swim shows, and yet the most complex in terms of story." [...] He contrasted it with other Williams Street productions, finding it to [...] "instead unrave slowly, revealing a little <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> what's underneath the surface while also piling on more and more questions."

500|$|The song {{served as}} both the opener for Extra Texture as well as, {{in the form of}} a 45-second {{instrumental}} portion titled [...] "A <b>Bit</b> <b>More</b> <b>of</b> You", the first track on side two of the original LP. Harrison biographer Dale Allison dismisses this reprise with the words [...] "It's filler", while Leng suggests its purpose was to [...] "fashion a soul mood" [...] for the song that follows, the pop-soul ballad [...] "Can't Stop Thinking About You". The full version of [...] "You" [...] appears on the 1976 compilation The Best of George Harrison as one of only six selections from Harrison's solo career up to the end of 1975.

500|$|Very {{little of}} the design from Freelance Police was carried over into Save the World; LucasArts still held onto the assets created for use in Freelance Police, and Telltale was wary of using similar design patterns. While Ferguson and Purcell had both been {{involved}} with the canceled LucasArts project, Grossman had not. The team decided to just start from fresh, and pursue a different treatment of the game's subject. Purcell himself wanted to ensure that the game conveyed the [...] "gritty" [...] feel of the original comics—something he felt was lacking from the LucasArts renditions of the franchise. Grossman stated that [...] "we wanted to get a little <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> that dirt on the streets, and the paper cups and people being mean and nasty". This [...] "gritty" [...] feeling also influenced artistic design. For instance, on Purcell's suggestion, the sky was changed from blue to yellow in the street outside Sam and Max's office, instantly making the environment feel [...] "filthy and disgusting".|$|E
500|$|Although Goldfaden, {{by his own}} account, was {{familiar}} at this time with [...] "practically all of Russian literature", and also had plenty of exposure to Polish theater, and had even seen an African American tragedian, Ira Aldridge, performing Shakespeare, the performance at Grădina Pomul Verde was only a <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a play than Grodner had participated in three years earlier. The songs were strung together {{with a bit of}} character and plot and a good bit of improvisation. The performance by Goldfaden, Grodner, Sokher Goldstein, and possibly as many as three other men went over well. The first performance was either Di bobe mitn einikl (Grandmother and Granddaughter) or Dos bintl holts (The Bundle of sticks); sources disagree. (Some reports suggest that Goldfaden himself was a poor singer, or even a non-singer and poor actor; according to Bercovici, these reports stem from Goldfaden's own self-disparaging remarks or from his countenance as an old man in New York, but contemporary reports show him to have been a decent, though not earth-shattering, actor and singer.) ...|$|E

I knew that was a catalyst to really turn up the team, to get a little <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> out <b>of</b> everyone. Denny goes down with his knee injury. He comes back, obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high to get a little <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> out <b>of</b> your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{competition}} between Kieswetter and Buttler for England's one-day wicket-keeping role also caused conflict at Somerset for the 2013 season: both players wanted to fulfil the {{role for the}} county. Kieswetter began the season as the wicket-keeper in the County Championship, but broke his thumb during the third match of the season, which {{kept him out of}} action for six weeks. Kieswetter had a particularly strong Twenty20 season, finishing as the leading run-scorer in the 2013 Friends Life t20 with , including five half-centuries. His teammate, Peter Trego, praised Kieswetter's ability to build big innings in Twenty20 cricket, and Kieswetter himself said that he [...] "tried to be a <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a responsible player, rather than just power blazing." [...] He scored a late-season century against Warwickshire in the County Championship, but in a season in which Somerset struggled against relegation, he scored a relatively modest 606 first-class runs at an average of 31.89. At the end of the season, Buttler, whose contract with Somerset had expired, announced that he was joining Lancashire, leaving Kieswetter as the clear first-choice wicket-keeper at Somerset.|$|E
500|$|The first-round {{series against}} the Magic was touted as the matchup {{between two of the}} league's best young big men in Bosh and Dwight Howard. Howard {{dominated}} throughout the series, while Bosh had a serires-best effort in Game 4 with 39 points and 15 rebounds. General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, [...] "Whether it's protecting [...] inside the paint, getting a little <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's clear we have to get better", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul. Bosh said after the loss, [...] "They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense better than we did and {{when it came to the}} small things, they did a better job... I can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win. That's pretty obvious. They beat us pretty good." [...] Unlike the previous campaign, Bosh was not named to any of the All-NBA teams.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to these compositions, Harrison revisited two unused recordings: the Motown-styled [...] "You", and [...] "His Name Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)", which open and close the album, respectively. Co-produced with Phil Spector in London, [...] "You" [...] was among the basic tracks taped in February 1971 for a planned Apple solo album by Spector's wife, Ronnie, formerly Veronica Bennett of the Ronettes. A reprise of the completed song, {{in the form of}} a brief instrumental titled [...] "A <b>Bit</b> <b>More</b> <b>of</b> You", also appears on Extra Texture, opening side two in the LP format. [...] "His Name Is Legs" [...] was recorded at Harrison's Friar Park studio, FPSHOT, shortly before the 1974 tour, with Billy Preston, Tom Scott, Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark. In a private joke that few listeners were able to appreciate, the song features a hard-to-decipher monologue performed by [...] "Legs" [...] Larry Smith, formerly a member of Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band. The inclusion of these two older tracks provided some upbeat material on an album predominantly filled with ballads.|$|E

[...] He continued, [...] "I love dipping into ... some of that material of Howard Hughes, which I'm sure he's kind of been likened to", and described his biggest challenge in playing the character as [...] "keeping it very realistic, but at the same time, tongue-in-cheek as well", and not making Stark [...] "too broad". On Carter and Stark's relationship moving into the second season, Atwell said, [...] "there’s a new comfort level between Stark and Peggy ... they’re on a <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an even level. She respects him hugely, but is also not afraid to comment on his lifestyle choices and how disgustingly misogynistic she finds him ... he does use women as a form of escapism for him and his Dionysian ways, but when it comes to Peggy, he doesn’t see her as big boobs and red lips. He sees her as someone he can actually have a proper conversation with. Which probably scares the hell out of him".|$|E

The game automatically collected statistics such as upload and matchmaking speeds, as well as game preferences; sorting out what Jarrard called [...] "the more subjective anecdotal feedback" [...] from emails, notes, and forums proved more difficult. The Reach beta generated over 360,000 forum posts on Bungie's community forums.
