50|$|Featuring special badging, {{with the}} {{exception}} of Calais, which featured unique limited edition parts, the rest of these special editions were base Commodores sold with extra equipment (e.g. full <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumper</b> bars, standard alloy wheels—from Berlina for the 50th Anniversary—but without the luxury interior features such as climate control and full trip computer).|$|E
50|$|Aesthetically, the X300 {{received}} several updates {{in the design}} refresh led by Geoff Lawson in 1991. The mostly flat bonnet of the XJ40 was replaced with a fluted, curvaceous design that accentuated the four separate round headlamps. Rear wings were reshaped to accommodate the new wrap-around rear light clusters. Also, the separate black-rubber bumper bar of the XJ40 is gone and replaced with a fully integrated <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumper.</b>|$|E
50|$|The XR4x4 was now {{based on}} the five-door {{hatchback}} bodystyle and featured different front and rear <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumper</b> styling, along with wider side rubbing strips. The RS Cosworth, from January 1988, was now {{based on the}} newly introduced saloon bodystyle and featured another style of front bumper {{as well as the}} black grille which was only found on UK versions of the saloon bodystyle. The RS Cosworth received more power and four-wheel drive from January 1990. In addition, a roller cam engine was added in 1987 to prevent excessive wear to the cam.|$|E

5000|$|TS: <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers,</b> new alloy wheels, seven-seater with third-row {{standard}} (RWD: AWD: [...] ).|$|R
50|$|Concurrent {{with the}} {{introduction}} of <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers</b> Ka² and Ka³ were replaced by Ka Collection and the LuxuryKa (later Ka Luxury).|$|R
50|$|In February 1999, the Vectra was updated, {{receiving}} a mildly modified body (that {{can be identified}} by the single piece headlight units and <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers)</b> together with somewhat improved handling and better equipment.|$|R
50|$|Other {{standard}} {{features on}} the Sportline include 18-inch weight-rated alloy wheels, <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers,</b> door mirrors and handles. It features suspension which is lowered by 30 mm over standard variants, and has chrome side bars and grille, a roof spoiler, {{as well as a}} special Volkswagen badge.|$|R
50|$|The D-Turbo and XS {{variants}} were fitted {{as standard}} with front fog lights, <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers</b> with deeper spoilers, sports seats and different steering wheel, and a wider, chromed exhaust tailpipe; 14-inch alloy wheels were an optional extra. The models fitted somewhere between the XR and XT variants in terms of standard equipment.|$|R
50|$|For {{the first}} three years of production, all models had black plastic bumpers to {{minimise}} parking damage to paintwork in city conditions. These bumpers contained a stabiliser to prevent UV degradation which made them unsuitable for painting because the paint would not adhere properly. However, it became clear that many owners wanted <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers,</b> so they were introduced in 1999 using different bumper mouldings (without the stabiliser).|$|R
50|$|The Lăstun was a {{low-cost}} Romanian car for urban transport built between 1988 and 1991, featuring a two-cylinder air-cooled engine of 499 cc, producing , fuel consumption of , a maximum speed 106 km/h and fiberglass bodywork {{similar to the}} Lancia Y10. A stretched bodywork prototype 500 Lăstun was exhibited at the 1989 Bucharest trade fair. Another prototype from the early 1990s featured hubcaps, <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers,</b> and head restraints.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, {{a special}} edition was {{produced}} for the first time, known as Dacia Dedicaţie. This luxury version of the saloon and estate had alloy wheels, <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers,</b> power steering, electric windows, and a far better level of finish. The models were all painted two-tone silver, and sold at a significantly higher price. From 2002, the cars became known as Berlina and Break, with the 1310 lettering being relegated to an insignificant position underneath the side light.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the course}} of its model history, trim levels {{included}} base Fox, GL, GTS, GLS, GL Sport, Polo, and a Wolfsburg Edition. Options included air conditioning, five-speed (vs. four) manual transmission and metallic paint. No automatic transmission was offered. The GL trim featured revised cloth trim, rear license plate backing, ceiling-mounted map light, glove compartment light, trunk light, tachometer (excepting wagon models), <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers,</b> hubcaps, passenger side exterior rear view mirror, 175/70-13 tires, locking gas cap and three-point rear seat belts.|$|R
50|$|The Austin Maestro {{emerged as}} the five-door {{hatchback}} variant. When the designs diverged, the Montego became project LM11 (the Maestro being LM10), and remained based on a lengthened version of the LC10s Volkswagen Golf style front MacPherson strut / rear twist beam chassis. The Montego received different front and rear styling following the replacement of designer David Bache with Roy Axe. It also featured <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers</b> (as did the Maestro), and front wipers which hid themselves under the bonnet when parked.|$|R
5000|$|The {{body of the}} Cabriolet did {{not change}} through the entire {{production}} run except for a larger fuel tank. The space saver wheel was fitted from the outset in 1978, when pre production models were built, unlike the saloon which adopted this in 1984. In an attempt by Volkswagen to keep the car's styling current, all Cabriolets from 1988 on were fitted with a [...] "Clipper" [...] kit out of the factory, featuring smooth <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers,</b> wheelarch extensions, and side skirts.|$|R
5000|$|The revised Series II (EB II) model, {{appearing}} in showrooms in April 1992, saw the six-cylinder engine upsized by 35 cubic centimetres (from 3949 cc to 3984 cc). This brought the nominal total swept capacity to 4.0 litres. The automatic transmission was updated to the M91LE specification, and the electronics were also improved, {{and there were}} tweaks to the styling. The base model now had <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers,</b> and the previously matte black plastic exterior door handles were now given a glossy finish. The update reportedly cost [...]|$|R
50|$|The range {{consists}} of two trim levels; LT and LTZ. Standard equipment for all Colorado 7s includes cruise control, <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers,</b> side steps, front fog lights, aluminium roof rails, rear parking sensors (in addition to the rear camera), Bluetooth phone connectivity, USB input, roof mounted climate control vents for second and third rows and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with multifunction controls. The LTZ adds 18-inch wheels, projector headlights, exterior chrome highlights, leather seats, a premium sounds system, a six-way adjustable driver’s seat, higher grade interior trim elements and LED tail-lights.|$|R
5000|$|Like many BL cars before it, early Montegos {{suffered}} from build quality and reliability problems which badly damaged the car's reputation amongst the public. In some ways, {{the technology was}} ahead of its time, notably the solid-state instrumentation and engine management systems, but the [...] "talking" [...] dashboard fitted to high-end models (and initially used to promote the Montego as an advanced high-tech offering) was prone to irritating faults and came {{to be regarded as}} something of an embarrassment by BL and the British press. This feature was discontinued after a short period. There were also problems with the early sets of <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers</b> which tended to crack in cold weather at the slightest impact.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1984, the {{front-wheel-drive}} four-door sedan [...] "Carina FF" [...] (T150 chassis) {{was introduced}} {{in addition to the}} rear-wheel-drive sedan range. Coupé, Surf (Wagon), and vans were sold continuously. Minor changes also took place, including <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers</b> for higher grade models. In August 1985, the trim levels were changed to shift the Sports models (1600GT, 1600GT-R, 1800GT-T, 1800GT-TR) into the front-wheel-drive range. Rear-wheel-drive coupé sales were terminated. The sedan lineup was now reduced to 1500 standard, DX, SG, and 1800 SG trim levels. Surf and van sales continued as heretofore. Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive Carinas continued to be produced alongside the new T150 series until May 1988 in Surf, Van, and sedan models. The Carina Van ended production in April 1987.|$|R
2500|$|Reportedly costing A$1million, the radically {{different}} Series II model of April 1992 primarily benefitted from a higher capacity 6-cylinder engine (up 35cubic centimetres or from 3949cc to 3984cc), bringing its nominal total swept capacity to 4.0-litres. The transmission and electronics were also improved and, externally, styling changes abounded including the base model now having <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers</b> and its matte black plastic exterior door handles in a glossy finish. Other {{aspects of this}} upgrade consisted of improvements in safety, electronics and overall refinement. For example: the car now featured an advanced [...] "Smartlock" [...] security locking system standard across all models; anti-lock brakes became optional; a lap sash centre rear seatbelt became standard (from 1993); foam-filled A-pillars helped deliver better crash protection and Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH) reductions.|$|R
50|$|Available in both Coupé and Cabriolet forms, styling {{refreshed}} with restyled and <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers,</b> {{similar to}} the 328 with more integrated indicators and driving lamps, and new alloy wheels with a more rounded face. The 3.2 also boasted a major interior update, with a more ergonomic layout and a more rounded instrument binnacle. Later cars, from 1987 onwards, also sported ABS brakes. Fuel injection remained the primarily mechanical Bosch K-Jetronic (CIS) with an O2 sensor in the exhaust providing feedback to a simple computer for mixture trimming via a pulse modulated frequency valve that regulated control fuel pressure. The ignition system was Marelli Microplex, with electronic advance control and one distributor per bank of the V8. The 1988 Mondial 3.2 would be the final model year that retained the relatively low maintenance costs of the 308/328 drivetrain, allowing major service items like timing belt and clutch replacement performed with the engine/transmission package still in the car.|$|R
50|$|The Futura {{shared the}} overall styling of the GLi {{and had the}} same engine and {{transmission}} options. While the Futura benefited from exterior differences such as <b>body-coloured</b> mirrors, <b>bumpers</b> and different wheel covers. The Futura was feature-rich, having front power windows, cruise control, ABS, rear headrests, interior map pockets standard, map lights, six-speaker audio system (six-stacker optional), a digital clock, variable intermittent wipers, fold-out rear-seat armrest and interior grab handles.|$|R
25|$|Powertrains were {{verbatim}} of the Camry, {{with the}} 3S-FC for the entry-level SL, and higher-end SLX and SLE models graced with the 3S-FE engine. An SLX option pack, {{known as the}} Executive was also available. The SL opened up the Apollo range with remote exterior mirrors, intermittent windscreen wipers, heated rear screen demister, remote trunk release for sedans and fuel filler door, a two-speaker radio cassette player and tinted side and rear glass. SLX variants were distinguished by their full wheel covers, {{as opposed to the}} SL model's steel wheels with centre caps. The Executive variant was not a stand-alone model, but an option pack for the SLX, adding power steering and automatic transmission. SLE equipment included the four-wheel disc brakes, variable intermittent windscreen wipers, a four-speaker stereo, <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers,</b> dual odometers, automatic headlamp cut-off system, velour seat upholstery, centre back-seat armrest, power antenna, central locking with illuminated driver's door lock and front map lamps. As per the Camry, in May 1991, the EFI version of the engine was made standard.|$|R
50|$|The {{car that}} would become the Delta during its {{development}} went by the project codename Y 5, was conceived as an upmarket front-wheel drive small family car positioned below the larger Beta; an offering around four meters in length had been absent from Lancia's lineup since {{the demise of the}} Fulvia Berlina in 1973.Design was by Giorgetto Giugiaro's Italdesign. Its platform put together MacPherson suspension developed for the Beta with four-cylinder, SOHC engines derived from the Fiat Ritmo. The Fiat engines were revised by Lancia engineers with a Weber twin-choke carburettor, a new inlet manifold, exhaust system and ignition. To achieve its market positioning the Delta offered features uncommon in the segment, as fully independent suspension, rack and pinion steering, available air conditioning, optional split-folding rear seat, height-adjustable steering wheel, and defogger. Its three-piece <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers</b> made from polyester resin sheet moulding compound were claimed by Lancia to be a first in the industry. The heating and ventilation were developed with help from Saab, experts in the field.|$|R

As per the Camry, in May 1991, the EFI version of the engine was made standard.|$|R
50|$|The Maestro {{incorporated}} many {{novel and}} pioneering features for its class. It had a bonded laminated windscreen, homofocal headlamps, <b>body-coloured</b> plastic <b>bumpers,</b> an electronic engine management system, adjustable front seat belt upper anchorage positions, an asymmetrically split rear seat, and a 12,000 mi service interval. The MG and Vanden Plas versions had solid-state instrumentation with digital speedometer and vacuum fluorescent analogue displays for tachometer, fuel and temperature gauges, trip {{computer and a}} voice synthesis warning and information system.|$|R
5000|$|For 2002, Audi {{increased}} {{power in}} the 1.8 Turbo engines to [...] and [...] - the 190 PS variant designated by a red T on the boot lid. Available with four wheel drive and in the 2.5 TDI intermediate version to [...] A 2.0 engine with Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) was also available. A year later, Audi reintroduced the S4, now powered by a [...] 4.2 L V8 engine, {{as well as an}} A4 Cabriolet convertible variant (Typ 8H), finally replacing the 80-based Audi Cabriolet which had been discontinued in 2000. It included an electro-hydraulic operated roof, which lowered in under 30 seconds and incorporated some styling changes, such as <b>body-coloured</b> lower <b>bumper</b> and sill panels, which later found their way to the saloon version.|$|R
50|$|In Australia, the RAV4 came in base Edge and {{upmarket}} Cruiser {{models in}} both three- and five-door configurations. The main differentiation {{between the two}} models was in appearance. Edge models came with unpainted grey bumpers and side cladding, mirrors, and door handles, and featured steel rims. Cruiser models gained <b>body-coloured</b> (painted) <b>bumpers</b> and moldings, mirrors, and door handles, alloy wheels, and ABS brakes. All models came equipped with a brand-new 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine featuring VVT (variable valve timing), resulting in improved power and torque, as well as fuel consumption. Permanent all-wheel-drive was a feature. Options were ABS brakes (on the Edge), and air conditioning (on all models). The second generation RAV4 enjoyed success in Australia, where it became the best-selling SUV {{in the country in}} 2001, overtaking its rival, the Honda CR-V, for the first time.|$|R
5000|$|In Japan, the Sprinter Carib {{was based}} on the 5-door 1.6 L (1,587 cc) station wagon. This version came {{standard}} with electric windows, air bags for both driver and front passenger and automatic transmission; several engine options were available. Externally it could be distinguished from the Corolla by its black, rather than <b>body-coloured</b> upper <b>bumper</b> and side mouldings and door handles. In front, new headlights and air intake mouldings and radiator intake openings were used, often with a [...] "Carib" [...] nameplate. The Carib was also fitted with a spoiler, with an integrated brake light, above the rear window on the back hatch, and some were fitted with roof rails. A [...] "Carib" [...] decal was used on the right, rear window in place of [...] "Corolla". Some versions of the Carib were four-wheel drive. Hiroshi Okamoto designed the front exterior design.|$|R
5000|$|The 1994 {{facelift}} {{was known}} {{within the industry}} as CN2. A reprojected front end was distinguished by a horizontal metal line in the grille. There were new headlamps, a new radiator grille, and front and rear bumpers. Inside, {{there was a new}} dashboard for the base models, while the top-of-the-range cars had luxuries such as <b>body-coloured</b> <b>bumpers,</b> rear head restraints, a radio-cassette, hubcaps, and the ever-present CN1 dashboard, this time in black plastic. This model was not to stay in production for very long; in 1995 the CN3 type was introduced. Practically the only differences were those of trim level and the radiator grille.From late 1994 little attention was paid to the improvement of the 1310 range, as Dacia launched a new model, the Dacia Nova. This was a compact saloon/sedan or hatchback with a three-box design. The design was rather outdated, because development work had started in 1983. The Nova is a 100% Romanian design, started after the end of any French involvement in Dacia. The model was unpopular, due to reliability and rustproofing issues. However, after improvements in 1996, the Nova became more often seen on Romanian roads. In 1998 a seven-seater prototype was produced using the panels and windows from the standard Nova saloon.In 1998, the anniversary year of three decades of production since the first Dacia rolled off the assembly line, vehicle number 2,000,000 emerged from the plant; this year saw the last restyling of the 1310. It was known as CN4 and involved a comprehensive restyling of the front end, new door handles, and a lightly restyled rear view mirror. The estate version was fitted with larger tail lights. Even though the model was over thirty years old, it sold exceptionally well due to a starting price of about 4,200 Euros and high availability of parts. [...] "Goodies" [...] such as a fuel-injection also helped keep the model relatively modern.|$|R
