25|$|Head {{restraint}} — {{refers to}} a device designed to limit the rearward displacement of an adult occupant’s head {{in relation to the}} torso {{in order to reduce the}} risk of injury to the cervical vertebrae in the event of a rear impact. The most effective head restraint must allow a <b>backset</b> motion of less than 60mm to prevent the hyperextension of the neck during impact.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to resolve}} process-facies links at both bed and {{environmental}} scales for the channel lobe transition zone (CLTZ). Data comes from existing experimental and modern CLTZ studies and from new outcrop studies. The experiments {{show that the}} CLTZ architecture of supercritical turbidity currents is complex and different from their counterparts where flows are subcritical throughout. Supercritical CLTZ’s are characterised by erosive channels formed by supercritical turbidity currents, by offset stacked lobes deposited from subcritical turbidity currents and by hydraulic jump related mouth bar deposits and upslope onlapping backfill deposits at the down slope end of the transition zone. Erosive channels and backfill features can be resolved by high resolution seismic data, yet evidence for supercritical flow must come from facies analysis of core data. Outcrop examples of the CLTZ from the Tabernas submarine fan (SE Spain) and the Llorenç del Munt deep-water delta slope (N. Spain) are used to establish such links between seismic scale architecture and facies recognised in cores. The outcrops described here were mapped as transition zone, and show 100 m sized, spoon-shaped scours filled with sediment containing sandy to gravelly <b>backsets</b> up to 4 m in height. Their facies and architecture is indicative of deposition by hydraulic jumps, can be recognized from cores, and is a good proxy for further predicting CLTZ architecture constructed by supercritical turbidity currents...|$|R

A spectrum of sedimentary structures is recognised, all of which occur {{over a wide range}} of scale: 1. cross-bedding with humpback, sigmoidal and ultimately low-angle cross-sectional foreset geometries (interpreted as recording the transition from dune to upper plane bed bedform stability field), 2. planar/flat lamination with parting lineation, characteristic of the upper plane bed phase, 3. flat and low-angle lamination with minor convex-upward elements, characteristic of the transition from upper plane bed to antidune stability fields, 4. convex-upward bedforms, down- and up-palaeocurrent-dipping, low-angle cross-bedding and symmetrical drapes, interpreted as the product of antidunes, and 5. <b>backsets</b> terminating updip against an upstream- dipping erosion surface, interpreted as recording chute and pool conditions.

40|$|On 21 April 2007, a Mw 6 · 2 {{earthquake}} struck Aysén fjord (Chilean Patagonia) {{and caused}} onshore and offshore mass movements which triggered tsunamis and density flows in the fjord. To {{better understand the}} facies successions in, and the intercalation of, the density-flow deposits, a study {{was made of the}} 2007 deposits in 22 short sediment cores taken in the inner Aysén fjord. By combining grain-size analysis with X-ray computed tomography scanning, it was possible to demonstrate that the encountered facies correspond to classical divisions of debrites and turbidites. The single-event deposits consist of a succession of several sub-deposits deposited under different flow directions and can be interpreted as stacked turbidites. Orientations of: (i) folds; (ii) imbricated mud clasts; (iii) <b>backsets</b> and foresets of climbing ripples; and (iv) asymmetrical convolute lamination were used to determine relative flow directions at the location of the cores. By assigning the basal flow of the stacked debrites and turbidites to the closest principal mass flow, the absolute flow directions of the sub-deposits were determined which, in combination with multibeam basin-floor morphology, allowed reconstruction of the 2007 density-flow successions in Aysén fjord. Furthermore, alternating flow directions provide evidence for a seiche induced by the density flows. It was concluded that X-ray computed tomography scans provide crucial information for reconstructing palaeoflows and can be a useful tool in marine and lacustrine sedimentology and palaeoseismology. The multidirectionality of sub-deposits in turbidites is, next to differences in mineralogy, a new criterion to identify stacked turbidites. These multidirectional, stacked turbidites are an indication of simultaneous triggering of density flows and can therefore, in most cases, be attributed to earthquakes, ruling out other triggers, such as floods, storms or other sediment failures...|$|R

This approach is potentially problematic given the underlying assumption that purely mechanical factors cause whiplash injuries — an unproven theory.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{horizontal}} {{distance between}} {{the back of the}} head and the frontal of the head restraint (<b>backset)</b> and rearward head movement relative to the torso (cervical retraction) were studied in different occupant postures and positions in a modern car. METHODS: A stratified randomized population of 154 test subjects was studied in a Volvo V 70 year model 2003 car, in driver, front passenger, and rear passenger position. In each position, the subjects adopted (i) a self-selected posture, (ii) a sagging posture, and (iii) an erect posture. Cervical retraction, <b>backset,</b> and vertical distance from the top of the head restraint to the occipital protuberance in {{the back of the head}} of the test subject were measured. These data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and linear regression analysis with a significance level set to p < 0. 05. RESULTS: In the self-selected posture, the average <b>backset</b> was 61 mm for drivers, 29 mm for front passengers, and 103 mm for rear passengers (p < 0. 001). Women had lower mean <b>backset</b> (40 mm) than men (81 mm), particularly in the self-selected driving position. <b>Backset</b> was larger and cervical retraction capacity lower in the sagging posture than in the self-selected posture for occupants in all three occupant positions. Rear passengers had the largest <b>backset</b> values. <b>Backset</b> values decreased with increased age. The average cervical retraction capacity in self-selected posture was 35 mm for drivers, 30 mm for front passengers, and 33 mm for rear passengers (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Future design of rear-end impact protection may take these study results into account when trying to reduce <b>backset</b> before impact.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the works {{consisted}} {{in the study of}} the diet therapy efficiency along with the use of the modern adapted formula based on the goat's milk "Nanny" in feeding of the infants, who are bottle fed and who suffer from atopic dermatitis.

The main group was made up of 32 children, who received the formula based on the goat's milk within the hypoallergic diet. The control group was made up of 26 children, who received a formula based on the soy protein isolates. Introduction of the formula based on the goat's milk into the food ration of the infants with atopic dermatitis provided the high clinical efficiency in 78 % of cases. It manifested itself in achievement of the disease remission by the 10 – 20 th day from the moment the therapy started, reduction of scorad index by 3, 5 times, reduction of the atopic dermatitis recrudescence period by 2 times, protraction of the remission by 3 times, reduction of the <b>backsets</b> by 2, 5 times against concentration reduction of IgE and allergen specific IgE to the cow milk proteins and casein in blood serum as far as it concerns the adequate growth and development of a child. Thus, the replacement of the products based on the cow milk for the wholesome children formula based on the goat's milk in the food ration of the patients, suffering from atopic dermatitis, allowed for both optimizing the diet therapy of the infants, ensuring their adequate physical growth and contributing to the control over the symptoms of disease.

40|$|Along {{the eastern}} Salento coast (Southern Italy), Cretaceous to Quaternary carbonates crop {{out on a}} 100 m high {{escarpment}} that connects a wide and relatively flat area to the Otranto Strait (Ionian Sea). Along the escarpment, faulted and tilted Cretaceous and Eocene limestones record deposition in shallow-marine and marginal carbonate environments. Younger carbonates disconformably overlie this substratum and they formed when the region was partially submerged. Accordingly, Priabonian to Messinian carbonates which crop out along the escarpment were interpreted as slope deposits linked to reef systems developed on {{the margin of the}} top area, while lower Pleistocene carbonates cropping out {{at the base of the}} same escarpment were considered coastal in origin and formed during the uplift of the region. Stratigraphic and sedimentologic studies carried out on these lower Pleistocene carbonates demonstrate that also these deposits should be considered as slope deposits. The studied carbonates are foramol-type ones and discontinuously crop out along the lower part of the escarpment. They show a variable thickness (from a few meters up to several tens) and often exhibit a fan morphology; they correspond to small isolated bodies (up to a few km 2 wide) developed in some indentations of the escarpment, and are composed of coarse skeletal grains mainly deposited via slumpings or grain flows. Successions are characterized by long clinobeds cut by slump scars downward passing to gullies; <b>backsets,</b> slumps and chaotic deposits fill these erosional features. Clinobeds are alternatively made up of molechfor and rodhalgal facies which respectively record resedimentation by grain flows of shallow marine carbonates developed on top of the region and along-slope carbonate production. Depositional systems correspond to small shallow-marine aprons whose discontinuous distribution along the escarpment (inside indentations) should be considered an original feature. The idea that these deposits record the Sicilian sea-level along the escarpment should be abandoned as they are not coastal deposits. The studied deposits should be correlated to the Calcarenite di Gravina Formation which in other areas of the Apulian Foreland (which the Salento region belongs to) are considered as the deposits linked to the subsidence induced by the estward migration of the south- Apennines orogenic system. The Quaternary uplift of the Salento region should be begun after the deposition of the studied slope deposits, as indicated also by a series of middle-upper Pleistocene marine terraces which start at heights higher than those ones of the studied deposits...|$|R

The following methods were used. Data were collected from 154 randomly selected Swedish individuals (78 males and 76 females). The volunteers and the BioRID II were examined in a Volvo V 70 car, year model 2003, in three positions: driver (hands on steering wheel), front passenger (hands in lap) and rear passenger. The study results were as follows: the BioRID II was found to correspond approximately to a 35 th- 45 th percentile male in stature (- 2 cm), a 35 th percentile male in weight (- 7 kg), a 96 th percentile female in stature (+ 11 cm) and a 69 th percentile female in weight (+ 8 kg).

However, the poor biofidelity of Hybrid III dummy and the evaluation method based on the neck rearward rotational angle of the dummy during rear impact are urgent issues. To solve these issues, a dynamic evaluation of OC-T 1 displacement, corrected for the seat back rearward inclination (hereinafter called “dynamic backset”), using BioRID II which has superior biofidelity, was studied to establish a test method with higher effectiveness, repeatability and reproducibility. From dynamic <b>Backset</b> evaluations by dynamic tests and simulations using IIWPG crash pulse on various types of seats and analysis of real world minor neck injuries involving such seats in Japan, the following new facts were found. (1) Dynamic <b>backset</b> can evaluate the effectiveness of various types of seats with whiplash mitigation features, such as reactive, passive, and WHIPS, more accurately than neck rearward rotation of Hybrid III.

40|$|Background: The latest {{generation}} of rear-end whiplash protection systems, {{as found in}} the WHIPS Volvo and SAHR Saab, have reduced injury rates by almost 50 % {{in comparison with the}} previous generation of seat/head restraint systems. Occupant behaviour, such as seated posture and seat adjustment settings, may affect the injury risk. Method: Five studies were conducted. Studie I was an injury outcome study based on insurance data. Studies II-IV investigated seat adjustment, occupant <b>backset,</b> and cervical retraction for drivers and occupants in different postures and positions in the car, during stationary and driving conditions. Study V compared the occupant data from studies II and III with a vehicle testing tool, the BioRID dummy, using the protocols of the ISO, RCAR, and the RCAR-IIWPG. Results: Female drivers and passengers had a threefold increased risk for medically-impairing neck injury in rear-end impacts, compared to males. Driver position had a double risk compared with front passenger seat position. Female drivers adjusted the driver seat differently to male drivers; they sat higher and closer to the steering wheel and with more upright back support. The volunteers also adjusted their seat differently to the ISO, RCAR, and RCAR-IIWPG protocol settings; both sexes sat further away from the steering wheel, and seat back angle was more upright then in the protocols. In stationary cars, <b>backset</b> was highest in the rear seat position and lowest in the front passenger seat position. Males had a larger <b>backset</b> than females. Cervical retraction decreased and <b>backset</b> increased for both sexes when posture changed from self-selected posture to a slouched posture. The BioRID II dummy was found to represent 96 th percentile female in stature, and a 69 th percentile female in weight in the volunteer group. Conclusions: Risks in car rear-end impacts differ by sex and seated position. This thesis indicates the need for a 50 th percentile female BioRID dummy and re-evaluation of the ISO, RCAR, and RCAR-IIWPG protocols, and further development of new safety systems to protect occupants in rear-end impacts...|$|E
40|$|Executive Summary 1. 1 Background In June 2007, the UK Government {{designated}} Islamic Studies a strategically important {{subject and}} asked HEFCE {{to develop a}} programme to support this field. As a consequence, JISC issued a call {{for a review of}} user requirements for digitised resources for researchers and teachers within higher education working in the field of Islamic Studies in December 2007. The project (acronym DigiIslam) to determine these user requirements was undertaken by a team at the University of Exeter and ran from March to May 2008. For the purposes of the Project, Islamic Studies was fairly broadly defined and included Islamic History, Islamic Art and Architecture, Islamic Music, Islamic Law, Islamic Philosophy, Islamic Science and Medicine, Islamic Finance and Economics, Islamic Sociology and Anthropology and Modern Islamic Thought and Politics. The Project focussed geographically on the Middle East, but included researchers working in other areas of Islamic culture such as South Asia where possible. 1. 2 Aims and Objectives • To landscape existing digitised resources for Islamic Studies. • To identify gaps in the provision of digitised resources in Islamic Studies. • To establish criteria to prioritise the potential materials and/or collections for digitisation. 1. 3 Methodology and Implementation • An online questionnaire was set up on the Project website and 145 academics, researchers, librarians and archivists in 35 institutions were contacted by email. 53 people completed the questionnaire, a response rate of 36. 5 %. • A Focus Group was set up drawn from academics, librarians and scholars from the UK Islamic Community and met on April 30 th at JISC Headquarters in London. • Telephone interviews were set up with several academics who were unable to attend the Focus Group. • Reading lists were sought from UK institutions which teach substantive courses on Islam, Islamic Studies and related subjects. In addition three libraries were asked to DigiIslam 6 / 66 provide lists of the most heavily used books in Islamic Studies. These lists were then analysed to determine which textbooks were the most popular across a wide range of institutions, and whether they were already available in digitised format and at what cost. • All UK theses completed during the past ten years were analysed in order to show trends in current research and to determine which areas were attracting the largest number of students. • Gateways and portals to Islamic Studies were examined by using existing resources and an annotated inventory of the most significant was compiled. The web was also scrutinised in order to ascertain the number of gateways offering access to digitised primary texts in Islamic languages, and any to discover whether technical limitations existed which might hinder their use. Information was also collated on digitised catalogues of Islamic manuscripts and on current Islamic digitisation projects. 1. 4 Output and Results 1. 4. 1 Use of Resources Nearly all the respondents already used online resources in Islamic Studies (90. 6 %), with the main purpose of this use being research (92. 1 %), although use of these resources for teaching was also high (73. 7 %). The most heavily used resources for research were current online journals and journal <b>backsets</b> (e. g. JSTOR) = 94. 7 % of respondents (of which 68. 4 % used this resource frequently), followed by online reference works in English = 88. 9 % (of which 52. 8 % use the resource frequently), primary texts in translation = 75. 6 % (of which 27 % frequently), and primary texts in Islamic languages = 72. 2 % (of which 25 % frequently). Resources for teaching followed a similar pattern. 1. 4. 2 Access to Resources Regarding access to various kinds of resource, four out of five respondents had access to current journals online and journals <b>backsets,</b> while seven out of ten were able to use major online reference works, and these three categories were by far the most highly rated. (70 % of all respondents rated them as of high importance for their teaching and research, compared to 23. 1 % for e-books and 32. 5 % for any kind of resource in an Islamic language). Cost was give as the principal reason for institutions not acquiring any particular resource. DigiIslam 7 / 66 1. 4. 3 Resources Current Unavailable Online Looking at resources currently unavailable online, English-language research monographs were given the highest priority for digitisation (53. 8 %), mainly because many academics either were unable to borrow books to use in their office or at home, or because their libraries did not hold the required book. Other significant areas were bio-bibliographical reference works (43. 6 %), translations into English of primary texts (41. 0 %), Islamic manuscript catalogues (35. 9 %), primary texts in Islamic languages (38. 5 %), current editions and <b>backsets</b> of periodicals in English (30. 8 % and 28. 2 % respectively), and <b>backsets</b> of periodicals in European languages (30. 8 %). When asked to assign a priority to making individual resources digitally available for teaching (book, periodical title, reference work, etc.), some respondents considered open (i. e. free) access to resources such as the Encyclopaedia of Islam, the Encyclopedia of the Qur'an and Esposito's Oxford Dictionary Dictionary of Islam as top priority, although the majority chose individual textbooks or major works of research. 1. 4. 4 Weight Attached to Different Areas of Islamic Studies Regarding the relative importance of different areas of Islamic Studies, the traditional staples of Islamic Studies dominated the survey, namely Islamic history (50 %), Qur'anic studies (47. 4 %), Islamic law (42. 1 %) and Hadith studies (34. 2 %), but the relevance of Islam in the modern world is highlighted by contemporary Islamic thought (44. 7 %) in third position, and the importance attached to Islamic/Islamist politics (23. 7 %) and Islamic sociology and anthropology (28. 9 %). Given the relatively small numbers of specialists in these fields, it is significant that Islamic art and architecture, Islamic science and medicine (both 18. 4 %) and Islamic finance and economics (15. 8 %) were rated more highly that Sufism (13. 2 %) and Shi`ism (10. 5 %). 1. 4. 5 Use of Websites, Gateways and Portals The use of websites was very high - 94. 7 % of respondents used websites produced by Islamic organisations in English frequently or occasionally, for example, but no single gateway or portal stood out as particularly significant. There was general agreement that archiving websites in Islamic studies is important (81. 6 % considered this very or fairly important). 1. 4. 6 Reading List and High-Use Book Survey The High-Use Book Survey showed little correlation between the most heavily used books in Islamic Studies in the libraries of Exeter, Leeds and SOAS. One high-use title is shared between Exeter and SOAS, and one high-use title between SOAS and Leeds, and only three titles are shared between the 63 DigiIslam 8 / 66 most heavily used books in the three libraries and the 29 most common titles in the reading list survey. Well over 50 % of the books in both the Reading List Survey and the High-Use Book Survey are currently not available in digital form. The results of these surveys show the grave difficulties in deciding which books to make available for free distribution, and it is not recommended that JISC support an Islamic E-Books Observatory project. 1. 4. 7 Survey of UK and Ireland PhD Theses The number of PhD theses awarded in the area of Islamic Studies from 1906 to 2006 is around 2000 theses, of which almost half (860) were awarded between 1997 and 2006. During this ten year period, 97 higher education institutions in the UK and Ireland awarded theses in Islamic Studies, although almost half of these (374) were undertaken in just ten universities. Just over 50 % of the theses awarded by the top ten universities (374) fall into six main subjects namely, Islamic Sociology/Anthropology including Gender Studies (50), Islamic Law (44), Islamic History (37), Islamic Politics (28), Islamic Finance (20) and Study and Documentation of Muslim Communities in the UK (20). 1. 5 Outcomes • Landscape about how academics, researchers and librarians working in Islamic Studies in UK higher education establishments use existing online resources for teaching and research. • In-depth information about what are perceived to be the gaps in online provision in Islamic Studies and recommendations as to how to fill these gaps. • The creation of a list of the most popular textbooks used by a representative cross-section of UK universities, with indications of which books are already available in digital format. • A survey of recent UK doctoral dissertations in Islamic Studies to ascertain trends in current research, so that any digital projects can be targeted to have maximum relevance. • An inventory of existing portals for Islamic Studies, libraries of online primary texts, digital Islamic manuscript catalogues and Islamic digitisation projects to be used as the basis for a national gateway to Islamic resources. • Recommendations on potential projects regarding digital Islamic Studies assets DigiIslam 9 / 66 1. 6 Summary of Recommendations Recommendation 1 : The creation of a National Gateway to Islamic Resources, including a gateway to primary texts, a full digitised set of UK Islamic manuscript catalogues, electronic versions of doctoral dissertations undertaken on Islamic Studies in the past the years, and an open-access repository for e-prints in Islamic studies. Recommendation 2 : A feasibility study should also be conducted into the creation a corpus of interactive online education materials, which could also be hosted by the national gateway Recommendation 3 : Continuation of the subsidies for major online works of reference in Islamic Studies. Consideration should also be given to increasing the subsidies to make the works|$|R
40|$|Although head {{restraints}} became mandatory {{in several countries}} during the 1960 s and 1970 s, the number of neck injuries is still rising, which indicates that current {{head restraints}} are not giving sufficient protection. Despite numerous epidemiological and parameter studies, there are no methods to estimate in advance the potential neck injury risk reduction {{as a result of}} a better positioned head restraint. The purpose of this study is to assess the influence of the head restraints on the long-term AIS I neck injury risk for real-life crash conditions. Madymo simulations of rear-end crashes were performed. The BioRID II seated in three car models was exposed to 20 recorded crash pulses with the potential to cause neck injuries. For each crash pulse, 132 head restraint positions were analysed in terms of NICmax value and long-term AIS I neck injury risk. It was found that the optimal head restraint position for almost all crashes was that with zero <b>backset</b> and the top of the head restraint at the same level as the top of the head. In general, the NICmax and the injury risk were primarily influenced by the <b>backset</b> and only to a small extent by the head-to-head-restraint height; the neck injury risk was reduced by 0. 1 for every 2. 5 cm decrease of the <b>backset.</b> The results of this study show that it is possible during the development phase to estimate the potential protection for redesigned or active head restraints...|$|E
40|$|Pre-pretensioners {{are active}} and {{reversible}} devices that apply light tension to the seatbelt (less than 300 N) which pulls road vehicle occupants rearwards {{and reduce the}} <b>backset</b> (head-to-head restraint horizontal distance). This action {{has been found to}} have the potential {{to reduce the number of}} whiplash injuries in rear impacts. However, pre-pretensioners induced a new load case on current Anthropomorphic Test Devices (ATDs) for which they have not been validated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biofidelity of two 50 th percentile male ATDs (BioRID-II and THOR-NT), under pre-pretensioner loading in a stationary environment. A literature review resulted in three testing positions that either occur frequently (<b>backset</b> exceeding recommendations) or have high injury potential (leaning far forward at the driver and front passenger seats). Experiments comprised six volunteer subjects, the BioRID-II and the THOR-NT. Corridors for the head-neck complex kinematics, and interaction of the subjects with the seatbelt, were generated based on data from the volunteer tests and ATD responses were compared to the corridors in terms of amplitude, peak occurrence and shape. For slight out-of-position cases (<b>backset</b> ~ 80 mm), the THOR-NT was found to be close to relaxed volunteers and the BioRID-II to tense volunteers; both were suitable for pre-pretensioner testing. Although the BioRID-II results were closer to the corridors than the THOR-NT results in the far forward leaning positions, neither showed sufficiently large rearward motions and head rotations to fit the corridors. Furthermore, head rotations were problematic for both ATDs in the three test positions. Therefore, construction changes to both the pelvis and occipital joints are suggested in order to improve the biofidelity of BioRID-II and THOR-NT in far forward leaning positions...|$|E

40|$|Some cross-beds incoarse-grained {{sandstone}} and pebble conglomerate of the Coso Formation (lower Pleistocene) {{are inclined}} against he direction of flow of depositing currents. Textural gradation, min-eralogical changes, and structural considerations {{show that the}} depositing currents flowed westward. About one half the cross-beds are inclined to the east, {{and the others are}} inclined to the west. The diametrically opposed irections do not fit the pattern expected of meandering streams. The eastward-inclined cross-beds are called <b>backset</b> beds. <b>Backset</b> beds are the planar (inclined) type and make an angle of 25 ° or less with the normal bedding planes. Cross-laminations are long tapered wedges with the wide part of the wedge at the base. Ma-terial within the wedge is coarse near the bottom and grades to finer material at the top. Normal foreset laminations are either the inclined or festoon (trough) type, and material within each lamina-tion is well sorted and not graded. The baekset beds are believed to have formed during the antidune phase of sediment transport described by G. K. Gilbert. The factors contributing to the antidane phase of sediment transport are high load, high velocity, high resistance, and shallow depth of water. Inasmuch as the deposits were probably deposited in a manner analogous to the heavily overloaded streams of the Basin and Range province today, all these factors could well have been present...|$|E

A {{detailed analysis of the}} section outcropping between Cuillas del Valle and Olleros de Paredes Rubias, has revealed fades which can be attributed to transitional continental-marine enviroments. These are horizontally bedded sandstones with oscillation ripples (lagoon and shoreface), and cross-stratified sandstones with <b>backset</b> laminae (tidal). Other cross-stratified sandstones (fluvial channels), laminated lutites (alluvial coastal plain), bivalve sandstones (tidal ?) and lutites with leaves (marsh), make up contemporaneously-related subenvironments. Storm wave action prevailed during the filling of a narrow erosional depression, and tidal action accompanied the later establishment of valleywide sedimentary condition...|$|E
40|$|Females have {{a greater}} {{prevalence}} of neck injuries than males in motor vehicle rear impacts, and have more flexible necks and osteoligamentous cervical spinal columns. In addition, gender-specific static or dynamic computational models do not exist. However, varying sized physical models (dummies) {{have been designed to}} account for gender/size differences for crashworthiness studies. The effect of gender bias on three-dimensional cervical vertebral geometry was investigated using computed tomography images of 109 normal adult healthy volunteers. Groups were separately size-matched for stature, sitting height, and head circumference. Analysis of variance techniques were used to identify gender effects. Vertebral level was also investigated. Support areas at each level were evaluated for gender bias using simple and multiple regression analyses that included variables such as body mass, stature, sitting height, and head and neck circumferences. Briefly, significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) smaller vertebral geometry in females may account for the increased kinematics of the cervical column. These results underscore the need to differentiate mathematical models based on gender to predict accurate biomechanical responses under physiologic and traumatic loadings. Responses of the 5 th percentile female and 50 th and 95 th percentile male dummies were investigated in rear impact acceleration loading using sled tests. The effects of head restraint height and <b>backset</b> on each dummy response were analyzed using overall kinematics and parameters such as head and T 1 accelerations, forces and moments at the head-neck junction, head-neck rotations, and various neck injury criteria. Briefly, peak accelerations and forces and moments did not follow the expected trend, that is, increasing dummy size increases the metric. The 50 th percentile male dummy responded with expected increases in injury criteria for all backsets and head restraint heights. A similar trend was not true for the 5 th percentile female and 95 th percentile male dummies. Peak head rotations were higher with the greatest <b>backset</b> for both head restraint heights. Peak head rotations increased with increasing <b>backset</b> and head restraint height, and this phenomenon was true for all dummies. This simple metric may be an efficacious parameter for use in rear impact crashworthiness. The effect of gender bias in cervical vertebral geometry and non uniform responses among the three sizes of dummies emphasize the need to include gender and size variables in computational and physical models for rear impact injury assessments...|$|E
40|$|The upper Miocene units {{cropping}} {{out along}} the southern coast of the Island of Menorca (Balearic Islands, Spain), are mainly represented by two carbonate depositional systems: an early Tortonian distally steepened ramp (Lower Bar Unit) and an upper Tortonian – lower Messinian reef-rimmed platform prograding complex (Reef Complex). Within the distally steepened ramp, Pomar et al. (2002) distinguished four facies belts: fan-delta conglomerates passing upwards to bioturbated packstones (inner ramp), cross-bedded grainstones (middle- ramp), clinostratified rhodolithic rudstone (ramp slope) and fine-grained wackestonepackstone with planktonic foraminifera (outer ramp). The backset-bedded units analysed in this work are placed at the transition between toe-of-slope and outer ramp sediments, below the wave-base-level. They infill the axial depression of large slide/slump scars. These scars truncate the gently, 10 °- 12 ° basinward dipping, slope-to-outer ramp clinoforms. <b>Backset</b> beds are cross-bedded forms that dip against the direction of flow of the depositing currents, therefore they present foresets migrating upcurrent (Gary et al., 1972). These sedimentary structures are well known and largely described on the foreset and toeset of Gilbert-type fan delta (Postma, 1984; Massari, 1984, 1996; Nemec, 1990). In carbonate depositional systems these type of bedforms are rarely found and only little described. The backset-bedded units, here analysed, are channel-like, wedge-shaped, 10 - 12 m thick, pinching out landward and extend laterally for tens of meters. Each unit is formed by several amalgamated set of <b>backset</b> beds, 40 cm to 2 m thick. These units are mainly conglomerates composed by bioclastic coarse-grained grainstone to rudstone. Large components are rhodoliths, bivalves, skeletal and ooid-rich pebbles to boulders, gastropods and corals. Matrix is of a bioclastic coarse-grained sand to fine gravel, made of fragments of bivalves, gastropods, rhodoliths, bryozoans, algae, echinoids, loose ooids and planktonic and benthic foraminifera. Ooids are locally very abundant both in matrix and as main components of pebbles. Pebbles are mainly flattened, elongated, of average size 6 - 8 cm (a-axis) and sometimes have mollusc borings on their surface: large (20 - 30 cm) rounded and spherical boulders are locally present. Intergranular and intergranular porosity is very high, cementation low and dolomitization patchy. Foreset laminae dip upslope with varying angles ranging from almost horizontal to 30 °; higher angles are mostly found in the basinward part of the unit. Lamination is underline by the orientation along laminae of coarser components especially of bivalves, pebbles and rhodoliths. Grain-size distribution has a particular trend that shows a progressive decrease in size landwards and upwards. Sorting may noticeably vary being high or absent in different bodies. The lower boundary of the backset-bedded units is represented by scour surfaces which, on a parallel-to-flow section are almost concordant with the stratification below, while on a perpendicular-to-flow section are concave-up shaped, presenting the very steep walls. The study of different outcrops along the coast evidenced some important variation in components: moving northward composition changed from almost completely rhodolithic-dominated to rhodolith-bivalve-ooid-pebble-dominated to bivalve-ooid-pebble-dominated with first findings of corals. Upslope bedform migration has been explained as forming when a supercritical flow encounters a local obstruction or a local break on the slope, and a hydraulic jump may occur within the flow, upcurrent from the obstruction. Sediment will be therefore deposited at the obstruction forming an up-flow-dipping slipface that will tend to accrete and migrate in the upflow direction (Nemec, 1990 and reference therein). The <b>backset</b> deposits of Menorca are found in deep-water settings but they are composed of shallow-water sediment. The formation of these <b>backset</b> beds is interpreted {{to be related to}} high energy storm-events able to remove sediment from shallow water and to transport it into deeper position. The sediment-rich outgoing flows channalized and accelerated along slide-scar axis, eroding and rapidly infilling up-slope the scours. In this portion of the ramp preservation potential is higher thanks to sediment deposition which buries and preserves these structures. The repetitive occurrence of <b>backset</b> bedded units within the outer-ramp sediments and the progressive variation in composition suggest that those processes where probably active at the transition between the ramp and the reef systems. Therefore the formation of these sedimentary structures is interpreted to be strictly link to concurrence of peculiar morphological features, hydrodynamic energy and grain-size availability. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) numerical simulation have been performed as an integrated part of this work to improve the understanding of the development of hydraulic jumps within concentrated density flows. The simulated parameters do not refer to the example of Menorca but to turbidity currents for which finer-grain size (sand-size) have been used in a smaller-scale topography compared to the one studied in outcrop. The work presented proposes some new stating points for further simulations to constrain more precisely the main parameters controlling and determining the occurrence of a hydraulic jump and the consequent deposition of sediment with <b>backset</b> bedding...|$|E
40|$|Ozonation of {{uncooked}} corn mash {{from the}} POET BPX process was investigated {{as a potential}} disinfection method for reducing bacterial contamination prior to ethanol fermentation. Corn mash (200 g) was prepared from POET ground corn and POET corn slurry and was ozonated in 250 mL polypropylene bottles. Lactic and acetic acid levels were monitored daily during the fermentation of ozonated, aerated, and nontreated corn mash samples to evaluate bacterial activity. Glycerol and ethanol contents of fermentation samples were checked daily to assess yeast activity. No yeast supplementation, no addition of other antimicrobial agents (such as antibiotics), and spiking with a common lactic acid bacterium found in corn ethanol plants,Lactobacillus plantarum, amplified the treatment effects. The laboratory-scale ozone dosages ranged from 26 – 188 mg/L, with very low estimated costs of $ 0. 0008 – 0. 006 /gal ($ 0. 21 – 1. 6 /m 3) of ethanol. Ozonation was found to decrease the initial pH of ground corn mash samples, which could reduce the sulfuric acid required to adjust the pH prior to ethanol fermentation. Lactic and acetic acid levels tended to be lower for samples subjected to increasing ozone dosages, indicating less bacterial activity. The lower ozone dosages in the range applied achieved higher ethanol yields. Preliminary experiments on ozonating POET corn slurry at low ozone dosages were not as effective as using POET ground corn, possibly because corn slurry samples contained recycled antimicrobials from the <b>backset.</b> The data suggest additional dissolved and suspended organic materials from the <b>backset</b> consumed the ozone or shielded the bacteria...|$|E

40|$|Large-scale step-like {{features}} {{within the}} South Taiwan Shoal and West Penghu submarine canyons on the northeastern continental {{slope of the}} South China Sea are investigated by integrating high-resolution multibeam bathymetric data and multichannel seismic profiles. These step-like features, ranging from 1. 2 to 10. 0 km in wavelength and 5. 4 – 80. 9 m in wave height, are mostly interpreted as cyclic steps formed by turbidity currents flowing through the canyons, based on their characteristic step-like morphology, in-train alignment, large wavelengths and aspect ratios (ratio of wavelength to wave height), and typical upstream-sloping <b>backset</b> bedding, among others. A train of 19 continuous steps delineated along the thalweg of the South Taiwan Shoal canyon measures up to 100 km and may be the longest ever reported. Nine short trains of scours identified on a terrace of the South Taiwan Shoal canyon are oriented parallel to the distributaries draining over the terrace and roughly perpendicular to the main canyon thalweg, indicating a complicated flow pattern within the canyon valley. Two trains of scours separated by an intracanyon high in the steeper middle reach of the West Penghu canyon are interpreted as transitional bed forms between antidunes and cyclic steps, which develop downstream into a train of five net-depositional cyclic steps with typical <b>backset</b> bedding in the gentler-sloping lower reach of the canyon. Average slope gradients for the canyon reaches with cyclic steps range from 0. 26 ° to 1. 24 °. Along each thalweg step train, a slope break is identified to separate the net-erosional cyclic steps in the steeper upstream segment from the net-depositional ones in the gentler downstream segment. Rough estimations indicate that the paleoflows are 100 to 300 m thick with maximum velocities of up to 10 m s– 1. The estimated flow depths match well with those inferred from geomorphologic analysis. Estimated paleodischarges of ? 7 – 23 × 105 m 3 s– 1 are equivalent to ten times the discharge of the modern Amazon River...|$|E

40|$|Eskers {{have been}} used to infer the {{dynamics}} and palaeo-hydrology of large ice sheets yet there are few suitable contemporary analogues for esker sedimentation during Quaternary glaciations. Consequently, models of esker sedimentation have been derived from morpho-sedimentary analyses of Quaternary eskers, but these lack rigorous constraints on their depositional timescales. We identify the controls on the large-scale sedimentary architecture of a large (> 700 m long, 10 °) inclined reflections, interpreted as <b>backset</b> accretion associated with large-scale bedform development; (4) down-flow dipping high-angle (> 15 °) inclined reflections, interpreted as foreset accretion associated with macroform progradation; (5) quasi-hyperbolic reflections, interpreted as zones of boulder clustering; and (6) zones of enhanced noise and EM signal attenuation, bounded on the upper surface by a continuous reflection sub-parallel to the ground surface, interpreted as buried ice associated with the conduit/channel base. These data suggest that deposition took place within a non-uniform englacial conduit, which has resulted in major up-flow to down-flow variations in sedimentary architecture. The complexities observed are a direct consequence of variations in sediment supply and the within-event evolution of conduit geometry.
