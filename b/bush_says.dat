500|$|The {{broadcast}} {{included a}} new tongue-in-cheek opening. The scene {{begins in the}} Simpsons' living room where the family is watching Bush's speech. When <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> [...] "to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons", Bart replies, [...] "Hey, we're just like the Waltons.

2500|$|The {{comment was}} brought up again in an {{interview}} with Amy Goodman for Democracy Now! in 2006. In January 2006, Belafonte led a delegation of activists including actor Danny Glover and activist/professor Cornel West to meet with President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez. In 2005, Chávez, an outspoken Bush critic, initiated a program to provide cheaper heating oil for poor people in several areas of the United States. Belafonte supported this initiative. He was quoted as saying, during the meeting with Chávez, [...] "No matter what the greatest tyrant in the world, the greatest terrorist in the world, George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>says,</b> we're here to tell you: Not hundreds, not thousands, but millions of the American people support your revolution." [...] Belafonte and Glover met again with Chávez in 2006. The comment ignited a great deal of controversy. Hillary Clinton refused to acknowledge Belafonte's presence at an awards ceremony that featured both of them. AARP, which had just named him one of its 10 Impact Award honorees 2006, released this statement following the remarks: [...] "AARP does not condone the manner and tone which he has chosen and finds his comments completely unacceptable." [...] During a Martin Luther King Jr. Day speech at Duke University in 2006, Belafonte compared the American government to the hijackers of the September 11 attacks, saying: [...] "What is the difference between that terrorist and other terrorists?" [...] In response to criticism about his remarks Belafonte asked, [...] "What do you call Bush when the war he put us in to date has killed almost as many Americans as died on 9/11 and the number of Americans wounded in war is almost triple? [...] By most definitions Bush can be considered a terrorist." [...] When he was asked about his expectation of criticism for his remarks on the war in Iraq, Belafonte responded: [...] "Bring it on. Dissent is central to any democracy." ...|$|E

25|$|On 31 December the US pledge was {{increased}} tenfold to US$350 million, with President <b>Bush</b> <b>saying</b> that that amount would probably increase further. President Bush also signed a decree ordering flags to be flown at half-mast {{during the first}} week of the new year.|$|R
2500|$|Cornwell {{has spoken}} {{negatively}} {{of the presidency}} of George W. <b>Bush,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "I was supportive of young George W. Bush because I liked his family. I {{thought he was going}} to be another Big George. Boy, was I ever wrong. It's not a democracy so much as a theocracy, and those are not the principles this country was founded on." ...|$|R
5000|$|On May 21, 2006, while {{promoting}} {{the release of}} the album Taking the Long Way, Maines recanted her 2003 apology to President <b>Bush,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "I don't feel that way anymore. I don't feel he is owed any respect whatsoever. ... If people are going to ask me to apologize based on who I am ... I don't {{know what to do about}} that. I can't change who I am." ...|$|R

5000|$|The advertisement, {{released}} in August 2015, attacked Bush, {{who was then}} the front-runner in the primary campaign, by playing a tape of Bush defending illegal entry into the U.S. by undocumented migrants as [...] "an act of love." [...] In the ad, mugshots of illegal immigrants who committed violent crimes in the U.S. alternate with footage of <b>Bush</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Yeah, they broke the law, but it's not a felony.... It's an act of love." ...|$|R
50|$|Kingi {{was riding}} her bicycle near Pinnaroo Park when Beck lured her into some nearby <b>bushes,</b> <b>saying</b> {{she was looking}} for her poodle and {{requested}} the girl's help.

Her body was dumped in a nearby creek bed and located six days later.|$|R
5000|$|He {{became a}} {{somewhat}} controversial {{figure in the}} conservative movement {{at the beginning of}} 2003, when he vocally opposed the impending US war with Iraq. On October 27, 2004, he publicly denounced George W. <b>Bush,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Mr. <b>Bush</b> has become an imperialist—one whose decisions as commander-in-chief have made the world a more dangerous place." [...] Eventually Wanniski endorsed the 2004 Democratic candidate, John Kerry although he clearly preferred the Republican platform on issues related to taxation.|$|R
5000|$|October 14, 2002: President <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> of Saddam [...] "This is a {{man that}} we know has had {{connections}} with al Qaeda. This {{is a man}} who, in my judgment, would like to use al Qaeda as a forward army." ...|$|E
5000|$|Aznar {{returns the}} {{conversation}} to the resolution. Aznar wants the resolution to mention that Hussein has lost his chance. Bush replies that he cares little {{about the content of}} the message, and Aznar responds that the Spanish will send the Americans some text for the resolution. <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> {{they do not have a}} set text--only the requirement that Saddam be disarmed. Aznar says that his text will be written to draw more international support, and Bush consents. Aznar then discusses his upcoming meeting with President of France Jacques Chirac on February 26, shortly after the resolution is announced. <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> that Chirac thinks of himself as [...] "Mr Arab," [...] and that the two have a rivalry over the Arab world.|$|E
5000|$|The AllMusic {{review by}} John <b>Bush</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "McRae brings back the spirit (and {{some of the}} phrasing) of Sarah Vaughan while still {{sounding}} very much like herself.

5000|$|The {{additional}} view by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), {{was critical}} of the <b>Bush</b> administration, <b>saying</b> it [...] "did not fairly represent the intelligence." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{transcript}} {{begins with}} <b>Bush</b> <b>saying</b> {{he wants to}} pursue a second resolution quickly, {{two or three days}} after the meeting. Aznar prefers three days later so the General Affairs and External Relations Council can meet beforehand. Bush envisions a resolution similar to one passed during the Kosovo conflict, and [...] "he wants it written so that it does not contain obligatory elements, that does not mention the use of force, and that states that Saddam Hussein has been unable to fulfill his obligations." ...|$|R
5000|$|The EBN {{modus operandi}} {{was to take}} cable {{television}} broadcasts and remix them with a funky beat, often having the lyrics [...] "sung" [...] not by a singer but by half-second sound clips from TV, spliced together. For example, the lyric [...] "electronic behavior control system" [...] would be created with a clip of Ross Perot saying [...] "electronic", followed by a clip of George H. W. <b>Bush</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "behavior", then Ted Koppel saying [...] "control", and finally a clip of Bill Clinton saying [...] "system". This technique has been named video scratching.|$|R
50|$|I {{think that}} when President <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> all options are on the table, the destabilization of Iran's ethnic provinces is one of them. Don't forget, Mr Mahmudali Chehregani, one of the pan-Turkist leaders {{agitating}} for a separatist Azeri agenda, was in Washington last year by invitation of the Defense Department.|$|E
5000|$|He dismisses as rhetoric {{claims by}} U.S. President George W. Bush that the attacks {{occurred}} because Islamic extremists [...] "hate freedom", saying: [...] "If <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> we hate freedom, let him {{tell us why}} we didn't attack Sweden, for example. It is known that freedom-haters don't have defiant spirits {{like those of the}} 19—may God have mercy on them".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> {{that he is}} [...] "an unwavering supporter" [...] of Israel and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [...] In a speech, Bush {{said his}} brother, former President George W. Bush, was his main adviser on policy with the Middle East. Bush later {{clarified}} that {{he was referring to}} policy on Israel, rather than on the Middle East as a whole.|$|E
5000|$|Inhofe, who in August 2008 had a 61% {{approval}} rating, emphasized {{his conservative}} record {{and tried to}} label Rice as a “committed liberal.” In the debates, Rice tried to connect Inhofe to George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>saying</b> “An era allowed this to happen. George Bush came into office eight {{years ago with a}} Republican majority and … an agenda of radical deregulation.” Rice also believed in global warming, something Inhofe is famous for being against. In the election, Inhofe had over $5 million in the bank. Rice had $3.8 million.|$|R

5000|$|In {{his review}} for Allmusic, Nathan <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> [...] "Throughout the set, Slim {{is happy to}} lend the {{spotlight}} to his sidemen, working the 88s behind Eddie Chamblee's tenor solo on 'I Am the Blues' and Billy Butler's guitar on 'Ballin' the Jack.' Even in these situations however, the pianist is dazzling and his commentary always worth paying attention to." ...|$|E
50|$|Aznar asks {{if there}} is a chance that Hussein will go into exile. Bush {{responds}} that it is a possibility, and another that Hussein may even be assassinated. <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> Hussein expects to be able to not be prosecuted in exile but that it is expected that more of Hussein's hidden crimes will be discovered, and he would then be judged in international court in The Hague.|$|E
5000|$|Bush {{has often}} been invited to speak to audiences overseas. <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> he has {{courtesy}} visits with world leaders but {{has no plans to}} wade into foreign policy. [...] "Oftentimes because of my father's goodwill, and because of the president being who he is, people might extend an invitation, and it's enjoyable for me," [...] Bush said. [...] "Some of these folks are family friends." ...|$|E
50|$|Gephardt's {{views on}} {{economic}} policy also {{changed over the}} years. He voted for Ronald Reagan's tax cuts in 1981; in the 2000s, however, he became a staunch opponent of similar tax cuts by President George W. <b>Bush,</b> <b>saying</b> that the enormous surplus created during the administration of Bill Clinton should have been spent on health care instead. Gephardt is widely viewed as an economic populist. He supports universal health coverage, fair trade, and progressive taxation. Although he once chaired the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, Gephardt {{in his later years}} in Congress distanced himself from the organization, finding his pro-labor views at odds with the DLC's pro-business positions.|$|R
500|$|Franken {{initially}} {{supported the}} Iraq War but opposed the 2007 troop surge. In {{an interview with}} MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, Franken said that he [...] "believed Colin Powell", whose presentation at the United Nations convinced him {{that the war was}} necessary. However, since then he had come to believe that [...] "we were misled into the war" [...] and urged the Democratic-controlled Congress to refuse to pass appropriations bills to fund the war if they did not include timetables for leaving Iraq. In an interview with Josh Marshall, Franken said of the Democrats, [...] "I think we've gotta make President George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>say,</b> 'OK, I'm cutting off funding because I won't agree to a timetable.'" ...|$|R
