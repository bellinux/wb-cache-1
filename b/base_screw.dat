40|$|During the {{construction}} {{stage of a}} building with high clearances, large spans and thick slabs, the isolated tower scaffolds which have higher load-carrying capacity are often considered {{to serve as the}} falsework and meet the load demand of the building. Because isolated tower scaffolds served as temporary supports are immediately removed after finishing {{the construction}} stage, the importance is often neglected. Up to now, the information on the structural design of isolated tower scaffolds has been rather scarce, and the assembly of isolated tower scaffolds on construction sites still relies mainly on the experienced workers. This phenomenon results in a high risk of collapse in actual application of isolated tower scaffolds on construction sites. This study explores the critical loads and the failure models of isolated tower scaffolds in various setups by testing actual installations of isolated tower scaffolds based on construction sites. The research results show that the <b>base</b> <b>screw</b> jack has a limited effect on the overall load-carrying capacity of isolated tower scaffolds. When isolated tower scaffolds are set up on ground with different elevations or on ground under an inclined top slab with varying elevations, the load-carrying capacity is not affected evidently if the elevation is less than half meter. On construction sites, when assembled in multiple layers, th...|$|E

The techniques used for local excision include conventional transanal excision, posterior access, therapeutic colonoscopy and transanal endoscopic approaches. The aim {{of the present study was}} to present a new surgical proctoscope for the endoscopic transanal excision of rectal lesions. A cylindrical proctoscope with a diameter of 4 cm was devised and built. The end inserted into the anus has a bevelled aspect and rounded borders, allowing correct exposure of the anal lesion. The rectoscope is fixed to the anal border with surgical thread through perforations in the external end. A <b>base</b> <b>screw</b> holds a fibre-light which illuminates the operative field. Part of the equipment is a guide which is positioned inside the rectoscope on insertion into the anus. In operations utilizing this proctoscope, 17 adenomas, 25 adenocarcinomas, 1 carcinoid and 1 endometrioma were excised. The diameter of the lesions varied from 1 to 6 cm. The range of procedures that are possible with this new proctoscope are similar to those achieved with conventional techniques which, however, require more expensive equipment. Hence, the present study demonstrates that this newly devised low-cost proctoscope is an efficient tool for the transanal endoscopic excision of rectal lesions...|$|E

40|$|Mechanical fault {{diagnosis}} of high-voltage circuit breakers (HVCBs) based on vibration signal analysis {{is one of}} the most significant issues in improving the reliability and reducing the outage cost for power systems. The limitation of training samples and types of machine faults in HVCBs causes the existing mechanical fault diagnostic methods to recognize new types of machine faults easily without training samples as either a normal condition or a wrong fault type. A new mechanical {{fault diagnosis}} method for HVCBs based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and multi-layer classifier (MLC) is proposed to improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis. First, HVCB vibration signals during operation are measured using an acceleration sensor. Second, a VMD algorithm is used to decompose the vibration signals into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The IMF matrix is divided into submatrices to compute the local singular values (LSV). The maximum singular values of each submatrix are selected as the feature vectors for fault diagnosis. Finally, a MLC composed of two one-class support vector machines (OCSVMs) and a support vector machine (SVM) is constructed to identify the fault type. Two layers of independent OCSVM are adopted to distinguish normal or fault conditions with known or unknown fault types, respectively. On this basis, SVM recognizes the specific fault type. Real diagnostic experiments are conducted with a real SF 6 HVCB with normal and fault states. Three different faults (i. e., jam fault of the iron core, looseness of the <b>base</b> <b>screw,</b> and poor lubrication of the connecting lever) are simulated in a field experiment on a real HVCB to test the feasibility of the proposed method. Results show that the classification accuracy of the new method is superior to other traditional methods...|$|E
