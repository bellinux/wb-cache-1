25|$|The {{crash site}} was within {{international}} waters, but the National Transportation Safety Board carried out an investigation, {{which was published}} on July 1, 1970. The report stated the probable cause as improper crew resource management and stated that the aircraft was fully capable of carrying out the approach and landing. The aircraft was conducting an instrument approach, but was following an unauthorized <b>back</b> <b>course</b> approach.|$|E
2500|$|Slightly after 17:20, {{an airline}} {{dispatcher}} {{confirmed that the}} weather was suitable at LAX for the landing. The aircraft made contact with Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center at 17:32 and were told to hold at Bakersfield. This holding was confirmed at 17:47. At 18:39, the aircraft was cleared to descend via Fillmore and to keep an altitude of 1,500 meters (5,000ft) via the newly designated Westlake Intersection, which was not yet on the charts. The crew was to conduct a <b>back</b> <b>course</b> ILS at LAX, although they lacked authorization and plates to conduct this. The weather at 19:00 consisted of scattered clouds at 300 meters (900 feet), ceiling-measured 500 meters (1,500 feet) overcast, visibility of [...] and light rain and fog.|$|E
50|$|These {{approaches}} {{include a}} localizer approach, localizer/DME approach, localizer <b>back</b> <b>course</b> approach, and a localizer-type directional aid (LDA). In cases where an ILS is installed, a <b>back</b> <b>course</b> {{may be available}} {{in conjunction with the}} localizer. Reverse sensing occurs on the <b>back</b> <b>course</b> using standard VOR equipment. With a horizontal situation indicator (HSI) system, reverse sensing is eliminated if it is set appropriately to the front course.|$|E

50|$|Modern {{localizer}} antennas {{are highly}} directional. However, usage of older, less directional antennas allows a runway {{to have a}} non-precision approach called a localizer <b>back</b> <b>course.</b> This lets aircraft land using the signal transmitted {{from the back of}} the localizer array. Highly directional antennas do not provide a sufficient signal to support a <b>back</b> <b>course.</b> In the United States, <b>back</b> <b>course</b> approaches are typically associated with Category I systems at smaller airports that do not have an ILS on both ends of the primary runway. Pilots flying a <b>back</b> <b>course</b> should disregard any glide slope indication.|$|E

50|$|The current race {{route is}} an out and <b>back</b> <b>course</b> and has runners {{running up and}} down an {{overpass}} bridge twice, making the course more difficult than necessary. Although there have been minor modifications in the course over the years, it continues the tradition of offering a route that connects the two former cities of Fort William and Port Arthur. The course is not a fast course and has never been certified.|$|E

5000|$|The {{horizontal}} situation indicator (commonly {{called the}} HSI) is an aircraft flight instrument normally mounted below the artificial horizon {{in place of a}} conventional heading indicator. It combines a heading indicator with a VHF omnidirectional range-instrument landing system (VOR-ILS) display. This reduces pilot workload by lessening the number of elements in the pilot's instrument scan to the six basic flight instruments. Among other advantages, the HSI offers freedom from the confusion of reverse sensing on an instrument landing system localizer <b>back</b> <b>course</b> approach. As long as the needle is set to the localizer front course, the instrument will indicate whether to fly left or right, in either direction of travel.|$|E
50|$|The Kingdom run annual {{road race}} {{that takes place}} in Irasburg Vermont each summer. The race both begins and {{finishes}} in the Irasburg town commons. The race consists of a down and <b>back</b> <b>course</b> which varies between paved and dirt roads. Runners have the option of participating in a 5 km, 10 km or 20 km distance. Water stations are placed at the 5 km, 10 km and 20 km turn arounds, as well as the 5 mile mark. Participants have the ability to either walk or run, and the record times are recorded for each distance. When results are analyzed at the end, the participants are grouped by sex. The record holders for each group are seen below.|$|E

50|$|A multi-configuration road {{course is}} planned. The 3.2 km (2 mile) FIM/FIA track will {{incorporate}} the oval through tunnels {{in and out}} under the back straight of the oval. This design will be unique in providing a “stadium section” for the road course that will utilize the permanent seating of the oval. The elevations of the site will allow the spectators in the oval grandstand to see the oval section {{as well as the}} back section of the road course. A second configuration will separate from the oval, and use only the back section of the road course to allow the oval and back road course to be used independently. A 2nd paddock area will be built along the longest straight to accommodate the <b>back</b> <b>course.</b> The road course paddock area will also be the location of light industrial buildings for race teams and motorsport related shops.|$|E
50|$|There weren't {{a lot of}} {{favorites}} in the event. The race {{started at}} an Olympic stadium and after 3 1/2 laps of the track they started on the out and <b>back</b> <b>course</b> through Atlanta. There was {{a large group of}} about 60 in front. It wasn't until mile 15 that things started to get stirred up. The South Africans made a wall at the front and proceeded to increase the pace. They were joined by Lee Bong- Ju. The race continued as such until mile 17. Josia Thugwane made a move and was joined by Lee Bong-Ju. Meanwhile, Erick Wainaina joined the two in front. The three switched leads several times until Thugwane made a move outside Olympic stadium. He took through the tunnel while Lee Bong-Ju passed the Kenyan. It was the closest finish in olympic history but Thugwane maintained his lead in the last mile to take the gold medallion in 2:12:36. Lee Bong-Ju took silver and Wainaina bronze.|$|E
5000|$|Western Air Lines Flight 470 {{departed}} Stapleton International Airport at 07:03 {{on a short}} {{domestic flight}} to Casper/Natrona County International Airport with 93 passengers and 6 crew. The aircraft climbed to its cruising altitude of FL220. At 07:36, following a descent to 12,000 feet, the flight crew contacted Casper approach control and advised that the flight was about 12 {{miles south of the}} Evansville Intersection. At that time, the controller cleared the flight to use the localizer <b>back</b> <b>course</b> approach for runway 25, to circle to runway 3, or to land straight in. The weather reported to the crew indicated poor visibility with light snow falling and wind 040deg at 9 knots. One minute later, the approach controller advised that [...] "runway 7/25 has been plowed. There's about a 1/4-inch of powder snow on it. Braking action reported, Convair 580, as poor. Runway 3/21 is being plowed at this time." [...] At 07:51, Flight 470 reported at the Henning Intersection and was cleared to contact the Casper Tower. The tower controller cleared the flight to land on runway 25 and gave the wind as 030deg at 8 knots. The flight was also advised by the controller that a disabled snow blower was [...] "just west of the intersection runway 21, left side runway 25, on the edge ...." [...] At 07:41:42, the first officer called out [...] "thousand to go to the field." [...] At 07:42:09, the first officer called [...] "approaching minimums," [...] and 12 seconds later, he called [...] "just about at minimums." [...] The aircraft then flew level for a few moments at the minimum descent altitude (MDA). At 07:42:25, the first officer called the runway in sight directly below the aircraft. At that time airspeed was 150 knots and the flaps were at 25deg. The first office then set the flaps at 30deg as the captain initiated the final descent. The aircraft crossed the threshold at reference speed +15 knots. The aircraft touched down 2375 feet from the departure end of the runway, about 6,306 feet from the approach end of the runway. The aircraft went off the departure end of the runway {{to the right of the}} centerline. After striking several metal stanchions in the first row of terminal bar lights, which were located 200 feet off the end of the runway, the aircraft struck a shallow irrigation ditch 280 feet off the runway end. The aircraft veered farther to the right and stopped about 800 feet beyond the departure end of the runway. There was no fire and the aircraft was damaged but only four passengers were injured. All 99 passengers and crew on board flight 470 got off the aircraft and survived.|$|E
