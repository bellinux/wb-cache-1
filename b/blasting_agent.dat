50|$|The {{best known}} <b>blasting</b> <b>agent</b> is ANFO explosive, a mixture {{containing}} primarily ammonium nitrate {{with a small}} quantity (typically around 6%) of fuel oil, most commonly diesel fuel. Other fuels and additives are used as well.|$|E

50|$|On November 3, 1984, {{two members}} of the M19CO, Susan Rosenberg and Timothy Blunk, were arrested at a mini-warehouse they had rented in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Police {{recovered}} more than 100 blasting caps, nearly 200 sticks of dynamite, more than 100 cartridges of gel explosive, and 24 bags of <b>blasting</b> <b>agent</b> from the warehouse.|$|E
5000|$|On {{an episode}} of MythBusters, {{experiments}} were done to see if dynamite {{can be used to}} clean out hardened concrete from inside of a mixer truck, with limited practical results. For the finale, an excessive amount of explosive (800 lbs of commercial <b>blasting</b> <b>agent)</b> was used, and was detonated from a long distance away.

40|$|Micro milling is an {{economically}} interesting process for manufacturin ~ of rwzc injection moulds for small and medium batches. In contrast to other mal-processes, like the LIGA-technique, it allows real 3 -dimensional piece s";ruc"lu;es. However, moulds obtained by micro milling of hardened steels often show burrs {{that have to}} be removed. Additionally, the typical surface textures due to the milling process can obstruct demoulding. Micro peening with abrasive <b>blasting</b> <b>agents</b> allows deburring and removing of the surface textures due to the milling process. Edge rounding can be almost avoided using appropriate peening parameters and the use of appropriate <b>blasting</b> <b>agents.</b> Micro peening with non-abrasive <b>blasting</b> <b>agents</b> such as glass or ceramic beads allows a removal of surface textures by plastic deformation. Surface roughness can be significantly reduced by levelling of profile peaks. In the work presented here the influence of the micro peening process on micro milled structures was studied for different <b>blasting</b> <b>agents</b> in difierent single-step and double-step processes. This included the investigation of deburring effect, edge rounding and the influence on the surface topography.

5000|$|One {{argument}} raised was {{the example}} of ammonium-nitrate fertilizer and Diesel oil, which can very often be found together in a farmer's possession (fertilizer for the crops, fuel for the tractor.) Both are lawful, and while they can easily be assembled into the <b>blasting</b> <b>agent</b> known as ANFO, possession of both has never been held to imply (without other evidence) that a farmer was [...] "making" [...] explosives.|$|E
5000|$|Methylammonium nitrate saw a {{resurgence}} when E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont), seeking {{to lower the}} cost of its TNT-based Tovex water-gel explosives, incorporated a mixture of methylammonium nitrate with ammonium nitrate which served as a basis for DuPont's water-gels manufactured under the names [...] "Tovex Extra" [...] and [...] "Pourvex Extra". Methylammonium nitrate, also known as PR-M (which stands for [...] "Potomac River—Mono-methylamine nitrate") soon was seen as the possible path toward creating a low-cost <b>blasting</b> <b>agent</b> (water gel explosives) that might replace the explosives based on nitroglycerin (dynamites).|$|E
50|$|While {{it looks}} like nylon cord, the core is a {{compressed}} powdered explosive, usually PETN (pentrite), and it is initiated {{by the use of}} a blasting cap. Detonation cord will initiate most commercial high explosives (dynamite, gelignite, sensitised gels, etc.) but will not initiate less sensitive blasting agents like ANFO on its own. 25 to 50 grain/foot (5.3 to 10.6 g/m) detonation cord has approximately the same initiating power as a #8 blasting cap in every 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) along its entire length. A small charge of PETN, TNT, or other explosive booster is required to bridge between the cord and a charge of insensitive <b>blasting</b> <b>agent</b> like ANFO or most water gels.|$|E
5000|$|A water-gel {{explosive}} is a fuel sensitized {{explosive mixture}} consisting of an aqueous ammonium nitrate solution {{that acts as}} the oxidizer. [...] Water gels that are cap-insensitive are referred to under United States safety regulations as <b>blasting</b> <b>agents.</b> Water gel explosives have a jelly-like consistency and come in sausage-like packing stapled shut on both sides.|$|R
50|$|Tertiary explosives, {{also called}} <b>blasting</b> <b>agents,</b> are so {{insensitive}} to shock that they cannot be reliably detonated by practical quantities of primary explosive, and instead require an intermediate explosive booster of secondary explosive. These {{are often used}} for safety and the typically lower costs of material and handling. The largest consumers are large-scale mining and construction operations.|$|R
50|$|Tovex (also {{known as}} Trenchrite, Seismogel, and Seismopac) is a water-gel {{explosive}} composed of ammonium nitrate and methylammonium nitrate that has several advantages over traditional dynamite, including lower toxicity and safer manufacture, transport, and storage. It has thus almost entirely replaced dynamite.There are numerous versions ranging from shearing charges to aluminized common <b>blasting</b> <b>agents.</b> Tovex {{is used by}} 80% of international oil companies for seismic exploration.|$|R
50|$|A few {{materials}} such as nitrogen triiodide cannot be touched at all without detonating, and so are of purely academic interest. Some other compounds with a high sensitivity to shock, such as nitroglycerin and acetone peroxide, may detonate from a firm jolt and so cannot be legally transported in pure form. Acetone peroxide is often used by amateurs and terrorists {{as a means to}} detonate other explosives as well as acting as the main <b>blasting</b> <b>agent,</b> often resulting in injuries or death to those who underestimate its sensitivity. A number of methods are known to desensitize nitroglycerine {{so that it can be}} transported for medical uses, and it is also incorporated into other less sensitive explosives, such as dynamites and gelignites.|$|E
5000|$|The {{truck was}} loaded with two tons of {{dynamite}} and four-and-a-half tons of the <b>blasting</b> <b>agent</b> nitro carbo nitrate. Rutherford had parked the truck after arranging his delivery for the following morning, despite warnings given to the Pacific Powder Company two days earlier not to leave such trucks unattended or park them in [...] "congested areas". A police officer named Donald De Sues and the Chief of Police were on site and managed to evacuate citizens from {{the area of the}} truck before the explosion. Donald De Sues and the Chief of Police were recognized as heroes that day and were both killed in the blast. A total of fourteen people died in the blast and fire, and 125 were injured. Damage was estimated at 10 to 12 million dollars; the powder company was eventually made to pay $1.2 million in civil damages, but was acquitted of criminal wrongdoing.|$|E
5000|$|His 50+ year {{career in}} {{theoretical}} and practical explosives spans some remarkable achievements. As an expert in explosives, Melvin was an investigator of the 1947 fertilizer explosion in Texas City, Texas. The Texas City Disaster is considered the worst industrial accident in United States history. In December 1956 he created a new <b>blasting</b> <b>agent</b> using a mixture of ammonium nitrate, aluminum powder, and fuel oil: a most unusual mixture. This explosive, {{the first of the}} so-called [...] "slurry explosives," [...] was remarkably safe. He did consulting work for the Iron Ore Company of Canada, where the aluminized ammonium nitrate slurry explosive (with water) he developed was successfully used. His work on slurry explosives {{paved the way for the}} development of the BLU-82, nicknamed the [...] "Daisy Cutter" [...] (because of its use in Vietnam to clear helicopter landing zones), one of the largest and most powerful conventional bombs in the U.S. military inventory, using aluminized slurry.|$|E
5000|$|Still less {{sensitive}} {{materials such as}} <b>blasting</b> <b>agents</b> like ANFO, or shell fillings like Composition B, are so insensitive that the impulse from the detonator must be amplified by an explosive booster charge to secure reliable detonation. Some polymer bonded explosives [...] - [...] especially those based on TATB [...] - [...] are designed for use in insensitive munitions, which are unlikely to detonate even if struck by another explosive weapon.|$|R
50|$|In some applications, {{material}} removal is achieved without abrasion. This is particularly {{common in the}} removal of fine burrs arising from machined aluminum such as automatic transmission components, and small flashings from castings. In these situations, the metal is loosely attached to the parent metal and hence can be readily displaced by {{the momentum of the}} <b>blast</b> <b>agent.</b> No abrasive erosion takes place as the remaining metal does not exhibit a smooth or rounded edge.|$|R

50|$|Over the 1980s {{the black}} power {{movement}} continued {{but after a}} decline in popularity and membership in organizations. The Black Liberation Army {{was active in the}} US until at least 1981 when a Brinks truck robbery, conducted with support from former Weather Underground members Kathy Boudin and David Gilbert, left a guard and two police officers dead. Boudin and Gilbert, along with several BLA members, were subsequently arrested. The May 19th Communist Organization engaged in a bombing campaign in the 1980s. On January 28, 1983, M19co bombed the federal building on Staten Island. On April 25, 1983, M19co committed a bombing at the National War College at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. November 7,saw the 1983 US Senate Bombing by M19co. On August 18, 1983, M19co bombed Washington Navy Yard Computer Center. Later, on April 5, 1984, M19co bombed the Israeli Aircraft Industries Building. April 20, 1984 saw a M19co bombing at the Washington Navy Yard Officers Club. On November 3, 1984, two members of the M19CO, Susan Rosenberg and Timothy Blunk, were arrested at a mini-warehouse they had rented in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Police recovered more than 100 blasting caps, nearly 200 sticks of dynamite, more than 100 cartridges of gel explosive, and 24 bags of <b>blasting</b> <b>agent</b> from the warehouse. On September 26, 1984, M19co bombed the South African consulate in the United States.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, {{effect of}} change of {{explosive}} type on fragmentation is investigated. Two blast tests in which ANFO {{is used in}} the first and BARANFO 50 {{is used in the}} second one as the main <b>blasting</b> <b>agent</b> were conducted at Lafarge Yibita � Lalahan Quarry. Both blasts were carried out at the same bench of the quarry having the same structural geology and same surface blast design parameters. The only varying parameter is the <b>blasting</b> <b>agent.</b> Both tests were monitored by continuous velocity of detonation recorder. Digital images were acquired from the muckpile after each blast test by using the same image sampling technique. Images were analyzed by using SPLIT software and size distributions of muckpiles obtained from both blasts were determined. SPLIT is a digital image processing software developed to compute size distribution of rock fragments from digital images. As a result of this research, it was shown that finer fragmentation is obtained by utilizing BARANFO 50 as the main <b>blasting</b> <b>agent</b> at a constant blasthole pattern. It is also shown {{that it is possible to}} expand the blasthole pattern as an alternative if the previous coarser fragmentation is preferred. Moreover, comparison of explosives should not be performed based solely on the purchase price. Since fragmentation affects all post-blast mining operations (loading, hauling, crushing, grinding, etc.), explosive performance should also be assessed by fragmentation evaluation using softwares which are proven to be accurate similar to SPLIT. 1...|$|E
40|$|For {{many years}} {{there have been}} small scale tests {{available}} for evaluating the toxic fumes production by cap-sensitive explosives (DOT Class 1. 1), but these {{could not be used}} with blasting agents due to the large charge sizes and heavy confinement required for proper detonation. Considering the extensive use of <b>blasting</b> <b>agent</b> in construction and mining, {{there is a need to}} determine the quantities of toxic fumes generated by blasting agents. At the International Society of Explosive Engineers Twenty Third Annual Conference on Explosives and Blasting Technique in 1997, the authors reported on a facility for detonating large (4. 54 kg), confined <b>blasting</b> <b>agent</b> charges in a controlled volume that had been constructed at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Pittsburgh Research Lab 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Experimental Mine. Since 1997, this facility has been used to collect data on toxic fumes produced by the detonation of various ammonium nitrate/fuel oil (ANFO) mixtures and several cap-sensitive explosives. ANFO composition ranging from 1 to 10 percent (pct) fuel oil have been studied. As expected from previous studies, with an increase in fuel oil content the carbon monoxide production increases, while nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide production decrease. The detonation velocity varies from 3, 000 to 4, 000 m/sec for the 1 to 10 pct range of fuel oil content, suggesting that ANFO mixes with improper fuel oil content may appear to detonate properly, while their fume production differs significantly from optimum. The study also considers such factors as degree of confinement, water contamination, and aluminum content on <b>blasting</b> <b>agent</b> fume production. Results indicate that water contamination of the ANFO has little effect on carbon monoxide production, but causes significant increase in nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide production. Decreasing confinement from Schedule 80 steel pipe to 0. 4 -mm thick sheet metal also has little effect on carbon monoxide production, but significantly increases nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide production. Adding 5 and 10 pct aluminum to the ANFO had no clear effect on carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, or nitrogen dioxide production...|$|E
30|$|The WV ranks {{second in}} the nation for {{explosives}} consumption (Apodaca 2010). Almost 350, 000 tonnes were used in WV surface coal mining in 2009. Considering an average price of <b>blasting</b> <b>agents</b> (bulk emulsions, slurry and ANFO) of $ 1.14 per kg, the surface coal mines in WV spent almost $ 400 million for explosives alone. This does not include additional blasting accessories such as detonators, boosters, detonating cords, lead lines, additional costs for labor, explosives truck-delivery, and shot services. The addition of the drilling, digging and loading costs for the blasted material amounts to a significant overall cost to mine operators.|$|R

Calculated waveforms, at ranges out to approximately 1 km, agree moderately well in the time domain with free-field data, and are in qualitative agreement with free-surface records. Comparison of computed waveforms for equally energetic chemical and nuclear sources reveals relatively minor differences beyond the immediate near-source region, with the chemical source having an {approximately} 25 % greater seismic moment but otherwise indistinguishable (close-in) seismic source properties. 41 refs., 67 figs., 7 tabs...|$|E
