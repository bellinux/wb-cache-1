5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{story to}} feature a <b>beheading</b> game is the 8th-century Middle Irish tale Bricriu's Feast. This story parallels Gawain in that, like the Green Knight, Cú Chulainn's antagonist feints three blows with the axe before letting his target depart without injury. A <b>beheading</b> exchange also {{appears in the}} late 12th-century Life of Caradoc, a Middle French narrative embedded in the anonymous First Continuation of Chrétien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail. A notable difference in this story is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. Lancelot is given a <b>beheading</b> challenge in the early 13th-century Perlesvaus, in which a knight begs him to chop off his head or else put his own in jeopardy. Lancelot reluctantly cuts it off, agreeing {{to come to the}} same place in a year to put his head in the same danger. When Lancelot arrives, the people of the town celebrate and announce that they have finally found a true knight, because many others had failed this test of chivalry.|$|E
5|$|Although the Act of Parliament {{defining}} {{high treason}} {{remains on the}} United Kingdom's statute books, during {{a long period of}} 19th-century legal reform the sentence of hanging, drawing, and quartering was changed to drawing, hanging until dead, and posthumous <b>beheading</b> and quartering, before being abolished in England in 1870. The death penalty for treason was abolished in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{individual}} murderers {{were perceived}} to have been so heinous that standard punishments like <b>beheading</b> or to be broken on the wheel were not regarded as sufficiently commensurate with their crimes, and extended rituals of execution that might include impalement were devised. The case of Pavel Vašanský (Paul Wasansky in German transcript) may serve as an example here.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{favored a}} strong central bank and high tariffs to protect American {{business}} and agriculture. He disfavored imprisonment of convicts except for murder, preferring efforts to reform criminals through labor; he also opposed courts-martial for military deserters. He supported capital punishment but opposed hanging, preferring execution by firing squad or <b>beheading.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to the U.S. Department of State and the DEA, Antonio Ezequiel was 6ft (1.83 m) tall, {{and weighed}} {{approximately}} 215lbs (97.5 kilos). He had an alternative {{date of birth}} on 5 May 1962. He had black-colored hair and brown eyes, and his aliases were Marcos Ledezma, El Licenciado (The Certified or The Lawyer), and Tony Tormenta (Tony the Storm), which he earned for his explosive personality and for <b>beheading</b> and torturing his rivals.|$|E
5|$|After the 1793 <b>beheading</b> of Louis XVI {{sparked a}} war between Britain and France (see the French Revolutionary Wars), Nova Scotia Governor John Wentworth rented Kavanagh's Island to house 600 French prisoners that had been {{captured}} on St. Pierre and Miquelon. The commander of the Halifax garrison, Brigadier General James Ogilvie, objected to the plan, and instead housed the prisoners at Cornwallis Barracks in Halifax. Several prisoners were able {{to escape from the}} makeshift prison, and the rest were sent to Guernsey in June 1794.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{record of}} punishment by decapitation in Halifax is the <b>beheading</b> of John of Dalton in 1286, but official records were not maintained until the parish registers began in 1538. Between then and 1650, {{when the last}} executions took place, 56 {{men and women are}} recorded as having been decapitated. The total number of executions identified since 1286 is just short of 100.|$|E
5|$|The {{execution}} of an Anglo-Saxon king on {{the orders of}} another ruler was very rare, although public hanging and <b>beheading</b> did occur at this time, as has been discovered at the Sutton Hoo site. Æthelberht's death {{at the hands of}} the Mercians made the possibility of any peaceful union between the Anglian peoples (including Mercia) less likely than before. It led to Mercia's domination of East Anglia, whose kings ruled over the kingdom for over three decades after Æthelberht's death.|$|E
5|$|The {{repeated}} <b>beheading</b> of Yagan's {{statue in}} 1997 prompted Aboriginal writer Archie Weller {{to write a}} short story entitled Confessions of a Headhunter. Weller later worked with film director Sally Riley to adapt the story into a script, and in 2000 a 35-minute movie, also named Confessions of a Headhunter, was released. Directed by Sally Riley, the movie won Best Short Fiction Film at the 2000 AFI Awards. The following year the script won the Script Award in the 2001 Western Australian Premier's Book Awards.|$|E

5|$|Various {{cases for}} rape, {{physical}} abuse and murder were prosecuted in court. Women, although usually having fewer rights by custom, {{were allowed to}} level civil and criminal charges against men. While suspects were jailed, convicted criminals were never imprisoned. Instead, punishments were commonly monetary fines, periods of forced hard labor for convicts, and the penalty of death by <b>beheading.</b> Early Han punishments of torturous mutilation were borrowed from Qin law. A series of reforms abolished mutilation punishments with progressively less-severe beatings by the bastinado.|$|E
5|$|Adrienne {{visits the}} nearly 110-year-old Malcolm Wyrmshadow (Douglas Seale), {{who had been}} Carno's {{apprentice}} as a young boy. Malcolm reveals that Carno met his demise after his last wife, Marie (Traci Clauson), discovered he was a murderer. Marie conspired with her lover, Gaston (Jeff Rector), to kill Carno by sabotaging the equipment for his most infamous and dangerous escapology trick, in which Carno dons a burning hood and escapes from bonds on a throne underneath a swinging axe. The sabotage leaves Carno horribly burned and disfigured, but he survives and viciously attacks Marie and Gaston. After killing Marie by <b>beheading</b> her, Carno is killed by Gaston, who then succumbs to his own wounds.|$|E
5|$|Al-Maʿarri is {{controversial}} even today {{as he was}} sceptical of Islam, the dominant religion of the Arab World. In 2013, almost a thousand years after his death, the al-Nusra Front, a branch of al-Qaeda, beheaded a statue of Al-Maʿarri {{during the civil war}} in Syria. The statue had been crafted by the sculptor Fathi Muhammad. The motive behind the <b>beheading</b> is disputed; theories range from {{the fact that he was}} a heretic to the fact that he is believed by some to be related to the Assad family.|$|E

5|$|Bran and Meera Reed {{are fleeing}} the wights, who {{continue}} to follow them from the cave. Bran, still in his visions, witnesses several events: Jaime Lannister killing King Aerys Targaryen, a dragon flying over the Red Keep, his fall from Winterfell which left him paralyzed, the Night King transforming Craster's last son into a White Walker, the Massacre at Hardhome, Ned Stark's <b>beheading,</b> {{the murder of his}} mother Catelyn and brother Robb in the Red Wedding, and wildfire exploding beneath King's Landing. As the wights close in, a black-clad rider appears and destroys some of the wights while pulling Meera and Bran onto his horse, allowing them to escape.|$|E
5|$|However, the Taiwanese Aboriginal {{peoples who}} were {{previously}} {{allied with the}} Dutch against the Chinese during the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652 turned against the Dutch during the later Siege of Fort Zeelandia and defected to Koxinga's Chinese forces. The Aboriginals (Formosans) of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty; the Sincan Aboriginals then proceeded {{to work for the}} Chinese and behead Dutch people in executions while the frontier aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on 17 May 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under the Dutch rule by hunting down Dutch people and <b>beheading</b> them and trashing their Christian school textbooks.|$|E
5|$|In the 2009 Friday the 13th reboot, young Jason (Caleb Guss) {{witnesses}} his mother's (Nana Visitor) <b>beheading</b> as a {{child and}} follows in her footsteps, killing anyone who comes to Crystal Lake. The adult Jason (Derek Mears) kidnaps Whitney Miller (Amanda Righetti), a girl who looks like his mother, and holds her prisoner in his underground tunnels. Months later, Whitney's brother Clay (Jared Padalecki) comes to Crystal Lake and rescues her. Eventually, Whitney uses Jason's devotion to his mother against him, stabbing him with his own machete while he is distracted when she appears.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, two {{separate}} embassies had been dispatched to Tyre {{to appeal to}} Ummidius Caius Quadratus, who as legate of Syria had some authority over the lower-ranking procurator of Iudaea. One, from the Samaritans, protested the Jewish attacks on Samaritan villages. The Jewish counter-embassy held the Samaritans responsible for the violence and accused Cumanus of siding with them. Agreeing to investigate, Quadratus proceeded in 52 to Iudaea, where he had all of Cumanus' Jewish prisoners crucified and ordered the <b>beheading</b> of several other Jews and Samaritans who {{had been involved in}} the fighting.|$|E
5|$|Some hymns narrate that Chinnamasta likes {{blood and}} thus is offered blood sacrifices at some shrines. The Shaktisamgama Tantra says that only brave souls (viras) should follow Vamamarga worship to the goddess. The Shakta Pramoda warns that {{improper}} worship brings severe consequences, with Chhinnamasta <b>beheading</b> the person and drinking his blood. Further, it explains the worship rituals {{to be followed by}} householders and those to be followed by renouncers. The Todala Tantra mentions that, as part of Chhinnamasta's worship, Shiva or his fierce form, Bhairava, be worshipped as Kabandha ("headless trunk") as the goddess's consort.|$|E
5|$|The goddess {{carries her}} own severed head– {{sometimes}} {{on a platter}} or in a skull-bowl– in her left hand. Though no legend mentions a specific weapon for the <b>beheading,</b> she holds a scimitar, a knife or a scissor-like object in her right hand. Though generally depicted with two arms, manifestations of the goddess with four arms also exist. While her own severed head and the sword appear in two of her hands, the implements in the remaining arms vary: a scissor-like object, a skull-bowl collecting the dripping blood from her head or blood stream from her neck, or a severed head, sometimes identified {{as that of the}} god Brahma.|$|E
