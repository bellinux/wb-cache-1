5|$|The {{concept for}} Eternal Punishment {{emerged during the}} writing for Persona 2: Innocent Sin. Halfway through writing the latter's script, Tadashi Satomi felt that the draft gave him the {{impression}} of needing an alternate point of view {{to that of the}} main hero. This concept formed the basis for Eternal Punishments plot. To foreshadow this, the team showed the main characters from Eternal Punishment through minor roles in Innocent Sin. Eternal Punishment began full development after the release of Innocent Sin. Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment both used the same game engine and structure. Kouji Okada, Innocent Sins producer, returned in the same role. When developing Eternal Punishment, the development team took what they learned from Innocent Sin and used it to improve the gameplay and the Rumor system. One of the <b>biggest</b> <b>concerns</b> when making Eternal Punishment was how much the development staff wanted to include, which went well beyond their original plans.|$|E

In an interview with Norwegian broadcaster NRK shortly after the 2008 incident, Konietzko responded to these claims by saying the recent shootings were a by-product of the copycat mentality and the Finnish shooters' desire to emulate the lifestyles and actions of the Columbine shooters. [...] "One of my <b>biggest</b> <b>concerns</b> immediately following this incident [...] was that there would be copycats repeating such things in the future, as there often are when people commit heinous crimes and acts of violence.

500|$|Cliff Martinez {{composed}} the film's soundtrack, which {{was his first}} score for Soderbergh since Solaris in 2002. Given that the pacing of the music was one of Soderbergh's <b>biggest</b> <b>concerns,</b> Martinez needed to maintain a brisk pace throughout the soundtrack, while also conveying fear and hope within the music. [...] "I tried to create the sound of anxiety. And at key, strategic moments I tried to use the music to conjure up the sense of tragedy and loss." [...] Martinez incorporated orchestral elements, and fused them with the predominantly electronic sounds of the score. He noted that the [...] "sound palette for Contagion came by way of combining three very different approaches Steven went through as he was cutting the film." [...] Martinez received a rough cut for the film in October 2010, which contained music that was imbued with elements of The French Connection (1971) and Marathon Man (1976). He [...] "loved" [...] those two soundtracks, and composed a few pieces in their style. A few months later, he acquired a new cut, which included music influenced by German electronic group Tangerine Dream. Toward the end, Soderbergh changed again and used contemporary soundtrack music that was [...] "more energetic and more rhythmic". Ultimately, Martinez used aspects of all three approaches: [...] "I reasoned that combining them would not only be effective but would give the score a style all its own." ...|$|E
2500|$|Butler {{discusses}} how {{gender is}} performed without one being conscious of it, but {{says that it}} does not mean this performativity is [...] "automatic or mechanical". She argues that we have desires that do not originate from our personhood, but rather, from social norms. The writer also debates our notions of [...] "human" [...] and [...] "less-than-human" [...] and how these culturally imposed ideas can keep one from having a [...] "viable life" [...] as the <b>biggest</b> <b>concerns</b> are usually about whether a person will be accepted if his or her desires differ from normality. She states that one may feel the need of being recognized in order to live, but that at the same time, the conditions to be recognized make life [...] "unlivable". The writer proposes an interrogation of such conditions so that people who resist them may have more possibilities of living.|$|E
2500|$|Ultimately serving {{more than}} four decades in the public service of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Easton began as an Attorney General for the island towns of Portsmouth and Newport, soon {{fulfilling}} the same role for the entire colony.

[...] In 1674 {{he was elected to the}} office of deputy governor, serving for two years, with a part of his tenure being during King Philip's War, about which he published a written treatise. [...] Following the overthrow of the Edmund Andros governorship under the Dominion of New England, Easton was elected as governor of the colony for five consecutive years. [...] While in office his <b>biggest</b> <b>concerns</b> were funding the ongoing war that England was fighting with France, and dealing with the disruptive French privateers. [...] Other issues during his tenure included a smallpox epidemic in Newport, charter issues having to do with Rhode Island's militia serving in other colonies, and the ongoing border line disputes with the neighboring colonies.|$|E

2500|$|Where this {{practice}} becomes problematic is when monarchs are [...] "mass-reared". Stories in the Huffington Post in 2015 and Discover magazine in 2016 have summarized the controversy around this issue. The frequent media reports of monarch declines has empowered many homeowners {{to attempt to}} rear as many monarchs as possible {{in their homes and}} then release them to the wild in an effort to [...] "boost the monarch population". Some individuals have taken {{this practice}} to the extreme, with massive operations that rear thousands of monarchs at once, like one in Linn County, Iowa. However, the practice of rearing [...] "large" [...] numbers of monarchs in captivity for release into the wild is not condoned by monarch scientists, because of the risks of genetic issues and disease spread. One of the <b>biggest</b> <b>concerns</b> of mass-rearing is the potential for spreading the monarch parasite, Ophryocystis elektroscirrha, into the wild. This parasite can rapidly build up in captive monarchs, especially if they are housed together. The spores of the parasite also can quickly contaminate all housing equipment, so that all subsequent monarchs reared in the same containers then become infected. One researcher stated that rearing more than 100 monarchs constitutes [...] "mass-rearing" [...] and should not be done.|$|E
