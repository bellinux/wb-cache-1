25|$|The {{physical}} form {{and construction of}} practical capacitors vary widely and many capacitor types are in common use. Most capacitors contain at least two electrical conductors often {{in the form of}} metallic plates or surfaces separated by a dielectric medium. A conductor may be a foil, thin film, sintered <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> metal, or an electrolyte. The nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. Materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, paper, mica, and oxide layers. Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices. Unlike a resistor, an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy.|$|E
25|$|The {{southwest}} area of {{the hill}} fort is apparently built over and around preceding Bronze Age burial mounds or tumuli. Part of the inner ditch is occupied by a large circular barrow, which was excavated, but was found empty. A few feet further to the west are two other barrows, over which the great inner rampart passes; these on opening, proved to be sepulchral: in the largest was found a cist containing burned human bones at the depth of two feet; and in the smallest, two skeletons were found, lying from south to north, {{the head of the}} smallest reclining on the breast of the other. On the breast of the largest skeleton there was a small ring or <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> stone, which was probably worn as an amulet.|$|E

25|$|The Russian abacus, the schoty (счёты), {{usually has}} a single slanted deck, with ten beads on each wire (except one wire, usually {{positioned}} near the user, with four beads for quarter-ruble fractions). Older models have another 4-bead wire for quarter-kopeks, which were minted until 1916. The Russian abacus is often used vertically, with wires {{from left to right}} {{in the manner of a}} book. The wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center, to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides. It is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right. During manipulation, beads are moved to the left. For easy viewing, the middle 2 beads on each wire (the 5th and 6th bead) usually are of a different color from the other eight beads. Likewise, the left <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> the thousands wire (and the million wire, if present) may have a different color.|$|E
500|$|... 1B-6 lies to {{the east}} of the Acropolis Plaza and {{contained}} an ancestral shrine, reflecting a long established tradition first seen at Tikal. Located under the building was a tomb lined with slabs of schist, which contained an elite burial. The remains probably belonged to a male, the teeth were inlaid with jade, and a <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> the same material had been placed in the mouth. Associated ceramic offerings date this tomb to the Early Classic.|$|E
2500|$|Marching {{bands in}} general and {{especially}} marching drum lines emphasize uniformity. To achieve absolute uniformity, {{every member of the}} drumline must play with proper stick heights. [...] A stick height is an approximate measurement of how high the <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> the stick comes off the drum head on any given note. [...] Regularly used heights range from 3" [...] to 12", with 1" [...] and 15" [...] being used mostly for visual effect. [...] Snares and tenors can use this chart to establish guidelines for stick heights, but techniques and specifications may vary between lines and can be changed depending on what the music calls for.|$|E

2500|$|PP can be melted using a speed welding technique. With speed welding, {{the plastic}} welder, {{similar to a}} {{soldering}} iron in appearance and wattage, is fitted with a feed tube for the plastic weld rod. The speed tip heats the rod and the substrate, {{while at the same}} time it presses the molten weld rod into position. A <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> softened plastic is laid into the joint, and the parts and weld rod fuse. With polypropylene, the melted welding rod must be [...] "mixed" [...] with the semi-melted base material being fabricated or repaired. [...] A speed tip [...] "gun" [...] is essentially a soldering iron with a broad, flat tip that can be used to melt the weld joint and filler material to create a bond.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 August, Frankel won the Juddmonte International Stakes at York. This {{race was}} over 10 furlongs {{and was the}} first time that he raced over more than a mile. Consequently, there was much {{anticipation}} as to whether he would stay the extra distance. Starting at odds of 1/10 against eight rivals, he barely came off the bridle to win easily by seven lengths from Farhh, who was a nose ahead of four-time Group 1 winner St Nicholas Abbey in third. Most striking, was the dominance Frankel's very high cruising speed gave him, particularly now upped in distance to 10 furlongs. Indeed, TV footage of the aftermath in the Winners' Enclosure, shows Cecil in genuine awe of his equine protégé, running his hands down the horse's back to demonstrate there was hardly a <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> sweat to be found. This was his eighth consecutive European Group 1 victory, breaking the previous record of seven in a row set by Rock of Gibraltar. After the race trainer Sir Henry Cecil said [...] "It's fantastic. It's great for Yorkshire and they deserved to see him." [...] He was attending the racecourse after missing Frankel's previous win due to ill health and said the win made him feel [...] "twenty years better.".|$|E
