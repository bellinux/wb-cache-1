40|$|Abstract—Bioimpedance {{measurement}} {{technology has}} been widely applied in many biomedical applications such as skin characterization, disease detection, biosensor, etc. The impedance of tissue may be changed due to the varied frequencies. Therefore, the bioimpedance measurement {{needs to be made}} over a wide frequency range. In this paper, a multi-frequency current sourece is proposed and designed. It includes (1) a microcontroller, (2) a programmable waveform generator, and (3) a voltage controlled current source (VCCS). The microcontroller is the kernel of the whole system that is used to program the waveform generator to produce the sinusoidal voltage signal over the frequency range of 100 Hz to 100 kHz. Then, this signal is converted to current using the VCCS based enhanced Howland current pump. From the results, the total harmonic distortions of the output current are only 0. 25 % and 0. 40 % for the load resistance of 1 kΩ at operational frequency at 1 kHz and 100 kHz, respectively. The phase difference of the output current is within the range of 0 to 19. 6 ° over the studied frequency range.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a new {{approach}} to sensing soft tissue damage in the diabetic foot is presented and multiple sensor modalities including linear and rotational accelerometers, temperature, humidity and galvanic skin response (GSR), pressure/-force, blood oxygen heart rate and fore foot flexure will be investigated with the aim of using multi modal sensing to improve understanding the diabetic foot. Bioimpedance is proposed and investigated as a novel measurement modality that directly observes the response of the tissue under test as a means of estimating tissue condition. The new sensing system and data collection with critical assessment is presented complimenting the existing metric of assessment. Diabetes is currently one of the greatest health risks facing the developed world where typically 6 % of the population is diabetic and an estimated 1 in 3 people are currently in a pre-diabetic state. The condition adversely affects the body’s glycaemic control mechanisms leading to macro vascular stiffening alongside the possible onset of peripheral neuropathy thus increasing the risk of secondary pathologies such as retinopathy, kidney failure and diabetic foot disorder. For those living with diabetes the loss of a foot due to diabetic foot disorder {{is one of the most}} debilitating and feared side effects of diabetes. The national health service (NHS) in the United Kingdom (UK) currently amputates circa 100 lower legs a week due to diabetic complications of which about 85 % are avoidable. As amputation leads to increased morbidity and mortality (68 % at five years post 1 st amputation) as well as a marked reduction in quality of life, this concern is well founded. Many metrics have been investigated as indicators of diabetic foot disorder, though none have shown sensitivity and specificity that would enable their use as a reliable diagnostic or predictor of ulceration.

Although {{many studies have}} examined genetic and environmental components of bone mineral density and calcaneal QUS measures, few of them were addressed to phalangeal QUS phenotypes, and none to graphic trace parameters. This study aims to evaluate the relative contribution of genetics in the expression of phalangeal QUS traits in the adult healthy population of a Sardinian genetic isolate. Our sample includes 6056 men and women aged 30 – 103 years, from 43 extended pedigrees recruited in 10 villages of Ogliastra region in occasion of a large epidemiologic survey. Amplitude-dependent speed of sound (AD-SoS), fast wave amplitude (FWA), signal dynamic (SDy), bone transmission time (BTT) and ultrasound bone profile index (UBPI) {{were obtained from the}} non-dominant hand using the IGEA DBM Sonic Bone Profiler ™. These phenotypes were first regressed on age, anthropometric and <b>bioimpedance</b> <b>measures,</b> serum calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase, alcohol and caffeine consumption, smoking status, exercise and also months since menopause and estrogens use in women. Adjusted QUS parameters were then analyzed by univariate and bivariate variance component models to obtain heritability estimates and genetic and environmental correlations. QUS parameters were correlated to age, anthropometric and <b>bioimpedance</b> <b>measures,</b> serum phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and to reproductive history and menopause in women. All phenotypes demonstrated substantial heritabilities ranging from 0. 29 ± 0. 03 for SDy to 0. 55 ± 0. 03 for FWA. Proportion of variance due to all covariates ranged from 36 % for SDy to 59 % for BTT. Many significant genetic and environmental correlations were found between the different QUS measures. In this study, genetic factors appear to play a relevant role in determining hand QUS measures even when taking into account various important environmental factors. Furthermore, the modest genetic correlations may imply the existence of partially unique sets of genes affecting different QUS traits, thus suggesting that QUS parameters measure different properties of bone tissue...|$|R

Scales intended for bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) have also been proposed to estimate the heart rate by amplifying the pulsatile impedance component superimposed on the basal impedance. However, electronic weighing scales cannot easily obtain the BCG from people that have a single leg neither are bioimpedance measurements between both feet recommended for people wearing a pacemaker or other electronic implants, neither for pregnant women. We propose a method to detect the heart rate (HR) from <b>bioimpedance</b> <b>measured</b> in a single foot while standing on an bathroom weighting scale intended for BIA. The electrodes built in the weighing scale are used to apply a 50 kHz voltage between the outer electrode pair and to measure the drop in voltage across the inner electrode pair.

40|$|Background: The {{non-invasive}} {{assessment of}} volume status in left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) is challenging. The main thesis {{objective was to}} establish the feasibility and potential clinical utility of repeated measures assessment of non-invasive biomarkers in defining changes in volume status within individual volunteers. Methods: Differential volume manipulation protocols were achieved in a three-staged plan of investigation, firstly, in patients with decompensated heart failure receiving intravenous furosemide, secondly, in normal volunteers receiving acute loads of oral water or intravenous saline, and thirdly, in stable LVSD patients on chronic furosemide dosing undergoing staged diuretic withdrawal and resumption. Repeated measures of biomarkers relevant to volume status including blood and urine biomarkers, echocardiographic and bioimepdance measures were performed to assess their sensitivity to the induced volume changes. Results Summary: I demonstrated the smallest variance for <b>bioimpedance</b> <b>measures,</b> and the largest variance for urine biomarkers. In the patients with decompensated heart failure, none of the biomarkers studied showed potential clinical utility at tracking acute volume response to intravenous furosemide. In the normal volunteers, {{a significant change in}} estimated blood volume was observed following intravenous saline, but not with acute oral water ingestion. Only whole-body and trunk <b>bioimpedance</b> <b>measures,</b> and to a lesser extent, mitral valve early peak velocity with and without the Valsalva manoeuvre, appeared sensitive enough to map these changes in volume status. In the stable LVSD patients, statistically significant increases in B-type natriuretic peptide, urinary creatinine, urinary kidney injury molecule 1, and in bioimpedance-estimated body water composition were observed with diuretic withdrawal, with levels of these markers reducing following diuretic resumption. However, the amplitude of the changes observed was either lower than the respective within-subject variance or too small to be potentially useful as a marker of volume change. This would thus limit the clinical utility of these biomarkers in the routine monitoring of volume status in LVSD. Conclusion: The repeated measures of biomarkers studied in response to different volume manipulations were interpreted {{in the context of their}} within-subject normal variance. None of the biomarkers studied appeared to have the ideal characteristics clinically for the monitoring of subclinical changes in volume status in stable LVSD or in response to acute diuresis in decompensated heart failure.

30|$|A recent {{clinical}} study, {{which prompted}} our systematic analysis of EIT findings obtained during BAL procedures, evaluated bioimpedance in patients undergoing bronchoscopic and blind BALs [14]. In that study, transient increases in electrical bioimpedance {{were identified in}} the EIT waveforms and attributed to the instillation of lavage fluid. Regions of high positive rel. ΔZ change, identified in the functional EIT images of the studied patients during the BAL procedures, were considered to represent the lung regions with fluid accumulation during the instillation. Our findings are clearly contradictory to these clinical observations, with instillation of lavage fluid consistently producing a decrease in rel. ΔZ. Our results are in harmony with theoretical considerations in relation to electrical resistivity of body tissues and sodium chloride solutions. The electrical resistivity of lung tissue in vivo is generally given at about 750 to 2100 [*]Ω cm (depending on the frequency of excitation currents, temperature, species and degree of lung inflation) [26, 27] whereas warm 0.9 % saline at body temperature has a resistivity of 51 [*]Ω cm [26].

40|$|IntroductionDetermination of {{adipose tissue}} proportion, {{as well as}} its spatial distribution, is a major part of {{metabolic}} syndrome assessment. Various methods, commonly used in mouse models, are either indirect measurement, invasive (destructive) or imaging techniques. Indirect measurement techniques, such as deuterium dilution (considered as gold standard) or bioimpedance are based on the measurement of body composition. They give access to the measure of total body fat, without distinction between visceral and subcutaneous fat volumes. Sacrifice and ex-vivo tissue weight allow both total fat measurement and partition between subcutaneous and visceral fat pad. It is a direct method that does not allow for longitudinal studies. Non-invasive micro-imaging modalities (magnetic resonance imaging and μCT) add, over others, the advantage of spatial localization of fat, in vivo. AimOf our study was to compare results of measurements of total body fat done by μCT and bioimpedance in mice. MethodsμCT was done using a dedicated in vivo imaging instrument (eXplore Vision 120, GE, USA) on 30 anesthetized mice. Each acquisition lasted approximately 12 min. Just after μCT, measurement of body composition was performed by bioimpedance (ImpediVET, ImpediMed, USA). ResultsThe average value of total body fat by μCT is 5 % higher than that obtained by bioimpedance. The standard deviation calculated from μCT measurements is lower than that obtained with bioimpedance (4. 8 % vs 6. 8 % respectively). The linear correlation of μCT and <b>bioimpedance</b> <b>measure</b> of total adipose tissue is moderate (r 2 = 0. 55). ConclusionIt is the first time, to our knowledge, that a comparison of total fat volume measurement between μCT and bioimpedance is performed in mice.

40|$|The {{association}} of sustained cerebral edema with poor neurological outcome following hypoxia-ischaemia in the neonate suggests that measurement of cerebral edema may allow early prediction of outcome in these infants. Direct measurements of cerebral impedance {{have been widely}} used in animal studies to monitor cerebral edema, but such invasive measurements are not possible in the human neonate. This study investigated the ability of noninvasive cerebral impedance measurements to detect cerebral edema following hypoxia-ischaemia. One-day-old piglets were anaesthetized, intubated and ventilated. Hypoxia was induced by reducing the inspired oxygen concentration to 4 - 6 % O- 2. Noninvasive cerebral <b>bioimpedance</b> was <b>measured</b> using gel electrodes attached to the scalp. Cerebral <b>bioimpedance</b> was also <b>measured</b> directly by insertion of two silver-silver chloride electrodes subdurally. Noninvasive and invasive measurements were made before, during and after hypoxia. Whole body impedance was measured to assess overall fluid movements. Intracranial pressure was measured continuously via a catheter inserted subdurally, as an index of cerebral edema. There was good agreement between noninvasive and invasive measurements of cerebral impedance although externally obtained responses were attenuated. Noninvasive measurements were also well correlated with intracranial pressure. Whole body impedance changes did not account for increases in noninvasively measured cerebral impedance. Results suggest that noninvasive cerebral impedance measurements do reflect intracranial events, and are able to detect cerebral edema following hypoxia-ischaemia in the neonate.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and C-statistics were calculated to describe the characteristics of a bioimpedance based algorithm as a predictor of HF decompensation 3 or 7 -days in advance of the clinical event. Results: Participants (mean age 69 ± 12 years, 43 % female, 88 % white, 11 % cognitively impaired, 12 % depressed) had a mean ejection fraction of 50 ± 18 %. HF-related rehospitalization occurred in 10 % (n= 4) and 10 % (n= 4) reported diuretic up-titration during the 45 -day follow-up. An algorithm analyzing bioimpedance up to 3 or 7 days prior to an event was related to HF readmission (C statistics for 3 and 7 days = 0. 83, 0. 94, respectively) and the combined outcome of HF hospitalization or diuretic up-titration (C statistics for 3 and 7 days = 0. 76, 0. 80, respectively). Conclusions: Early readmission after hospitalization for ADHF was common and predicted up to 7 days in advance by an algorithm analyzing transthoracic bioimpedance. Despite their advanced age and high burden of comorbid diseases, study participants with ADHF were able to make daily bioimpedance measurements using a FAV and transmit them using a smartphone. Transthoracic bioimpedance monitoring may offer possibilities for reducing HF readmissions by enabling identification and treatment of outpatients with early HF decompensation...|$|R
30|$|Therefore, the {{objectives}} of the present study conducted in patients undergoing conventional cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were twofold: 1) to compare continuous endotracheal <b>bioimpedance</b> cardiac index <b>measured</b> with ECOM with continuous calibrated pulse contour analysis measured with the PiCCO 2 system; and 2) to assess the diagnostic accuracy of changes in cardiac index during PLR given by ECOM in predicting fluid responsiveness. We tested the hypothesis that the ECOM device would be a convenient and reliable tool for both cardiac index measurement and prediction in fluid responsiveness in that setting.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The authors {{hypothesized}} that <b>bioimpedance</b> cardiography <b>measured</b> by the Endotracheal Cardiac Output Monitor (ECOM; ConMed, Utica, NY) is a convenient and reliable method for both cardiac index (CI) assessment and prediction in fluid responsiveness. DESIGN: A prospective observational study. SETTING: A teaching university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five adult patients. INTERVENTIONS: Admission to {{the intensive care}} unit after conventional cardiac surgery and investigation before and after a fluid challenge. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Simultaneous comparative CI data points were collected from transpulmonary thermodilution (TD) and ECOM. Correlations were determined by linear regression. Bland-Altman analysis was used to compare the bias, precision, and limits of agreement. The percentage error was calculated. Pulse-pressure variations (PPVs) and stroke-volume variations (SVVs) before fluid challenge were collected to assess their discrimination in predicting fluid responsiveness. A weak but statistically significant relationship was found between CI(TD) and CI(ECOM) (r = 0. 31, p = 0. 03). Bias, precision, and limits of agreement between CI(TD) and CI(ECOM) were 0. 08 L/min/m(2) (95...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of a magnetic field on a living human organism was monitored using a bio-impedance evaluation of vasodilatation effects. A quantitative evaluation of the {{influence of}} a magnetic field on a human being was implemented by means of a quantitative evaluation of changes in the bio-impedance of the tissue. The pulse of the magnetic field was controlled by a pseudo-random impulse signal using a power switch that controlled the current of the applicator coil. The peak magnetic field flux density was approximately 60 mT. The <b>bioimpedance</b> was <b>measured</b> by a four-electrode method by means of a radiofrequency narrow band vector bioimpedance meter. Experiments were performed on the magnetic exposure of the forearm of an exposed human subject. During exposure to a magnetic field, the bioimpedance change signal level increases above the normal level, and reaches the maximum level after about 10 minutes. The maximum value is approximately 50 % higher than the normal level...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Aminoglycoside {{antibiotics}} have {{a narrow}} {{margin of safety}} between therapeutic and toxic levels. The current study used multiple frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis to develop prediction equations for gentamicin distribution space in neonates. Methods: Gentamicin pharmacokinetic parameters and <b>bioimpedance</b> were <b>measured</b> in 14 infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. Stepwise regression {{analysis was used to}} develop predictive models, using impedance quotients (F- 2 /R), weight and gestational age as variables, whose predictive performance was then tested in a second group of ten infants. Results: The prediction model with the smallest bias and highest concordance correlation was that which included F- 2 /R- 0 and weight. This bias of 50 mi or 6. 7 % was less than half of that found using a model including weight alone. Conclusion: A bioelectrical impedance-based prediction equation for prediction of gentamicin distribution space in neonates was produced. Although this prediction equation represents only a small improvement over that using weight alone, this is of clinical significance due to the narrow margin between therapeutic and toxic levels for gentamicin. A clinical trial to confirm the value of this methodology is now warranted...|$|R
40|$|Localized <b>bioimpedance</b> (BIA) was <b>measured</b> with {{a single}} {{frequency}} phase-sensitive analyzer at 50 kHz in three post-traumatic types of injuries on four professional soccer players: (1) myositis ossificans, (2) intramuscular seroma and (3) trochanteric (hip) bursitis. Normal reference value (no injury) {{was obtained from the}} contra lateral not injured limb at a mirror-like location of the injury. The relative variations resistance (R) and reactance (Xc) at the time of injury was confronted with the not injured values. Relative variations between acute measurements and post medication ones on intramuscular seroma and bursitis have been computed. In intramuscular seroma and trochanteric bursitis we have obtained a percent of change between injury data and after medical intervention. On myositis ossificans, localized BIA showed a 7 - 8...|$|R
