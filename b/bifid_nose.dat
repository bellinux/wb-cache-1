50|$|Nasal {{deformity}} correction: The {{correction of}} the broad nasal base is simultaneously done with the orbital hypertelorism repair. This is for good alignment of the eyes with the nose for the best aesthetic result. A <b>bifid</b> <b>nose</b> tip will only be treated {{at the age of}} 18, when the patient's skeleton has fully matured.|$|E
50|$|Females {{are more}} {{commonly}} and usually more severely affected than males. Males can however have (some of) the same symptoms as females, {{but this is}} not frequently seen. Most males have mild symptoms such as hypertelorism and a broad nasal base with <b>bifid</b> <b>nose,</b> but can also be a carrier of the mutation yet stay clinically unaffected.|$|E
40|$|Fronto-nasal {{dysplasia}} or {{the median}} cleft face syndrome {{is characterized by}} marked hypertelorism {{in conjunction with a}} broad nasal tip which is frequently bifid. It is usually sporadic but familial cases have been reported. <b>Bifid</b> <b>nose</b> without hypertelorism has also been reported. <b>Bifid</b> <b>nose</b> can also be a feature of many other syndromes.

40|$|Epignathus teratomas {{are rare}} tumors that {{originate}} {{in the region of}} the palate or pharynx and are known as Rathke pouch. They may be associated with other malformations such as a cleft palate and <b>bifid</b> tongue or <b>nose.</b> the prenatal diagnosis can be established by two-dimensional ultrasonography showing a heterogeneous mass protruding through the mouth of the fetus. the three-dimensional ultrasonography in rendering mode permits better understanding of this anomaly by the parents, facilitating the counseling. the importance of prenatal diagnosis {{lies in the fact that}} this tumor may obstruct the airways, thus leading to death at birth due to respiratory insufficiency. We report a case of prenatal diagnosis of epignathus teratoma in the 30 th week of pregnancy by two-dimensional ultrasonography. We focus on the importance of three-dimensional ultrasonography in rendering mode for demonstrating the spatial relationships of the tumor with the oral cavity and provide correlations between the ultrasound images and the anatomopathological findings.

40|$|Background: Encephaloceles {{are rare}} {{congenital}} lesions containing neural tissue and meninges which are anterior or posterior. They can {{be associated with}} other central nervous system anomalies or very rarely tumors. Case presentation: Here we report a nine month old girl with basal encephalocele, <b>bifid</b> <b>nose</b> and hypertelorism. Anterior encephalocele was associated with a tumoral lesion that was resected and diagnosed to be mature teratoma. Her hypertelorism remained stable during follow up. Conclusion: Basal encephaloceles associated with teratomas are very rarely observed. Early surgery of these lesions has been performed to stop the progression of craniofacial deformity and improve the prognosis. The suggested mechanisms of this rare association are the enrolment of neural crest cells causing both encephalocele with teratoma and interposition of tumor cells in the future skull leading to encephalocele formation...|$|E
40|$|An autosomal-recessive {{syndrome}} of <b>bifid</b> <b>nose</b> and anorectal and renal anomalies (BNAR) {{was previously}} {{reported in a}} consanguineous Egyptian sibship. Here, we report the results of linkage analysis, on this family and on two other families with a similar phenotype, which identified a shared region of homozygosity on chromosome 9 p 22. 2 -p 23. Candidate-gene analysis revealed homozygous frameshift and missense mutations in FREM 1, which encodes an extracellular matrix component of basement membranes. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrated gene expression of Frem 1 in the midline of E 11. 5 mouse embryos, {{in agreement with the}} observed cleft nose phenotype of our patients. FREM 1 is part of a ternary complex that includes FRAS 1 and FREM 2, and mutations of the latter two genes have been reported to cause Fraser syndrome in mice and humans. The phenotypic variability previously reported for different Frem 1 mouse mutants suggests that the apparently distinct phenotype of BNAR in humans may represent a previously unrecognized variant of Fraser syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Ensuring {{uniformity}} in the nomenclature {{standardization of}} facial creases {{is important to}} enable the scholarly community to follow and debate the advancements in research. This review highlights the prevailing disparity in the nomenclature that refers to the same facial crease by researchers and laypeople, and suggests uniform names for the facial creases based on available literature. The previous and current trends in facial crease classification are also discussed. The nomenclature of the facial creases considered for this review include the following: the nasolabial fold, corner of the mouth lines, upper and lower lip creases around the mouth region, the mandibular folds, the <b>bifid</b> <b>nose,</b> the transverse nasal line, the vertical glabellar line, chin crease, the mental crease, four type of creases around the eyes, forehead creases, and periauricular creases. A figure illustrating the above facial creases is included as reference. It is hoped that the proposed standardization of nomenclature would ensure a more scientific referencing of facial creases enabling more effective scientific interaction among the scholarly {{community as well as}} the laypeople interested in the research and application of facial creases...|$|E

40|$|Background Manitoba-oculo-tricho-anal (MOTA) {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} condition defined by eyelid colobomas, cryptophthalmos and anophthalmia/ microphthalmia, an aberrant hairline, a bifid or broad nasal tip, and gastrointestinal anomalies such as omphalocele and anal stenosis. Autosomal recessive inheritance had been assumed because of consanguinity in the Oji-Cre population of Manitoba and reports of affected siblings, but no locus or cytogenetic aberration had previously been described. Methods and results This study shows that MOTA {{syndrome is}} caused by mutations in FREM 1, a gene previously mutated in <b>bifid</b> <b>nose,</b> renal agenesis, and anorectal malformations (BNAR) syndrome. MOTA syndrome and BNAR syndrome can therefore be considered {{as part of a}} phenotypic spectrum that is similar to, but distinct from and less severe than, Fraser syndrome. Re-examination of Frem 1 bat/bat mutant mice found new evidence that Frem 1 is involved in anal and craniofacial development, with anal prolapse, eyelid colobomas, telecanthus, a shortened snout and reduced philtral height present in the mutant mice, similar to the human phenotype in MOTA syndrome. Conclusions The milder phenotypes associated with FREM 1 deficiency in humans (MOTA syndrome and BNAR syndrome) compared to that resulting from FRAS 1 and FREM 2 loss of function (Fraser syndrome) are also consistent with the less severe phenotypes resulting from Frem 1 loss of function in mice. Together, Fraser, BNAR and MOTA syndromes constitute a clinically overlapping group of FRASeFREM complex diseases...|$|E
40|$|The no. 0 - 14 cleft {{involves}} the midline {{of the face}} and cranium. It may include both a true and a false median cleft lip, with or without associated hypotelorism or hypertelorism. The no. 0 cleft {{is the most common}} of the craniofacial clefts. The objective {{of this study was to}} review the functional outcome and aesthetic results of the different techniques applied for each case. We have conducted a retrospective analysis of our series consisting of 32 cases of Tessier no. 0 cleft, in the period between 1997 and 2007. The patients were divided into 2 groups: those with the true median cleft and those with the false median cleft. The clinical findings, lip malformation, alveolar cleft, nasal appearance, septal involvement, associated deformities, and surgical procedures, were all reviewed. Holoprosencephaly was present in 9 cases, with a false median cleft upper lip and an absence of the premaxilla, septum, and columella (only 1 patient underwent lip and columella reconstruction at 2 years of age). Nine patients had an incomplete median cleft lip. Seven of these cases had associated median alveolar cleft, and 1 had an intranasal tumor, associated with lipoma of corpus callosum, characteristic of the Pai syndrome. Six cases of a <b>bifid</b> <b>nose</b> were seen, 2 of which were associated with an alveolar median cleft and hypertelorism. An isolated median alveolar cleft was present in 7 cases, 2 of them associated with a no. 30 cleft. This article presents a large series of Tessier no. 0 cleft, describing the differences between the false and the true median cleft. The surgical procedures may vary in relation to the type of involvement...|$|E
40|$|Midline facial defects with hypertelorism (MFDH) is {{the name}} {{suggested}} for a rare and heterogeneous group of craniofacial disorders mainly character-ized by ocular hypertelorism and <b>bifid</b> <b>nose.</b> Sever-al denominations {{have been used for}} this condition, such as median cleft face syndrome 1, frontonasal syndrome 2, frontonasal dysostosis 3; and malforma-tive frontonasal sequence 4. Frontonasal dysplasia 5 {{is the name}} most commonly accepted; however, after a critical review of this clinical condition based upon dysmorphology concepts the same authors proposed the denomination frontonasal malformation 6. The existence of different denominations can be easily attributed to the clinical complexity of this condi-tion, which has been described from different points of view, according to the professional experience of each author. Considering all these particularities, the descriptive name herein proposed (MFDH) could be a real possibility of an integrative denomination for different health professionals. In the future, it could facilitate the descriptions concerning this heteroge-neous group.

Group A included patients personally examined by the authors, while Group B included those previously evaluated by other geneticists. Among the 14 patients from Group A, there were 7 with distinct pictures of multiple congenital anomalies. In Group B, 5 of the 17 patients also exhibited a distinct pattern of defects. Among isolated MFDH, there was association with anomalies of the skull and facial bones (13 / 14), otorhinologic (11 / 16), central nervous system (9 / 16), and ocular (6 / 7), and audiologic (3 / 16); 1 / 3 of the cases had a relevant gestational intercurrences. Isolated FNM may have involvement of environmental components in some cases; the possibility of a syndromic picture should be extensive inves-tigated.
