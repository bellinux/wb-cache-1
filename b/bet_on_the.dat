5|$|In early 1898, The Montreal Gazette {{reported}} that NL president Nicholas Young signed Chamberlain as an umpire {{for the coming}} season. Chamberlain did not ultimately work for the NL because he was unhappy with the salary that he was offered.

He challenged Jack Baty, a black fighter, to a boxing match and posted a $500 <b>bet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fight. There is no record of Chamberlain boxing against Baty or anyone else, and little is known about his life after the major leagues.|$|E

Meanwhile, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) has agreed to be a surrogate mother for her brother Frank (Giovanni Ribisi) and his older wife Alice (Debra Jo Rupp), but is concerned that they are paying $16,000 for the IVF procedure which only has a 25% chance of success, and is helpless to influence the results.|$|E
5|$|Returning from Melee are trophies, statuettes {{of video}} game {{characters}} and objects that give brief histories or descriptions of their subjects, such as Mario and Link, or other characters and items {{that appear in}} their respective series. A minigame, the Coin Launcher, replaces the lottery machine from Melee as the primary method of obtaining trophies. The Coin Launcher is a machine that uses coins as projectiles to shoot trophies and counter incoming dangers such as missiles. Coins {{can also be used}} to <b>bet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> victor of online battles via Spectator mode. Trophies unavailable in Coin Launcher mode are obtained by using an item called the Trophy Stand on weakened enemy characters and bosses within The Subspace Emissary. Trophies obtained in this manner may contain information on the backstory of the Subspace Emissary.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Attorney General Jack Conway {{was asked}} to issue advisory opinions on two gambling-related issues. Republican state senator Damon Thayer asked for an opinion as to whether Instant Racing – allowing individuals to <b>bet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outcome of previously run horse races – would be allowable under the state constitution. Democratic Representative Jody Richards also asked for an advisory opinion as to whether a constitutional amendment was required to allow video lottery terminals at the state's racetracks or whether they {{could be construed as}} legal under the amendment that allowed a state lottery. Critics charged that Conway had a conflict of interest in the matter because his father {{was a member of the}} Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, but Conway denied that a conflict existed, and the state Executive Branch Ethics Board refused to take a position unless an official request for an investigation were made. Conway subsequently opined in June 2009 that video lottery terminals would be legal if governed by the Kentucky Lottery Corporation and in January 2010 that instant racing would be allowable under the state's parimutuel betting statutes with a few regulatory changes.|$|E

5000|$|In {{gambling}} and economics, the favourite-longshot bias is an observed phenomenon where on average, bettors tend to overvalue [...] "long shots" [...] and undervalue favourites. That is, in a horse race where one horse is given odds of 2-to-1, and another 100-to-1, the true odds might for example be 1.5-to-1 and 300-to-1 respectively. <b>Betting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> [...] "long shot" [...] {{is therefore a}} much worse proposition than <b>betting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> favourite. In the long run, losing 5% by <b>betting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> favourite, but losing 40% on longshots is not uncommon. Various theories exist to explain why people willingly <b>bet</b> <b>on</b> such losing propositions, such as risk-loving behavior, risk-averse behavior or simply inaccurate estimation as presented by Sobel and Raines.|$|R

50|$|There are two {{versions}} to this system, single-dozen bets and double-dozen bets. In the single-dozen-bet version, the player uses a progressively incrementing stake list {{starting from the}} casino table minimum, to the table maximum. The aim here {{is to use a}} single-dozen bet to win before the stake list ends. Many techniques are employed, such as <b>betting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same dozen to appear after two consecutive appearances, <b>betting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dozen that has appeared most in the last 15, 9, or 5 spins, and <b>betting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dozen that, after a long absence of 7 or more spins, appears for the first time. The double-dozen bet version uses two dozen bets and half the stake list size of the single-dozen-bet version.|$|R

25|$|The {{industry}} of greyhound racing was particularly attractive to predominantly male working-class audiences, {{for whom the}} urban locations of the tracks and the evening times of the meetings were accessible, and to patrons and owners from various social backgrounds.
