5|$|There {{was little}} {{fighting}} for the next month of the campaign, <b>but</b> <b>Washington</b> moved his army to White Plains in October after hearing that the British were attempting to trap him on Manhattan. After being defeated at the Battle of White Plains and later at Fort Washington, Washington and his army retreated across New Jersey, pursued by the British, into Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Game 1 {{was held}} in Washington, where Capitals owner Ted Leonsis took steps to prevent Penguins' fans from {{purchasing}} tickets, such as not selling tickets to customers whose 724 or 412 area code indicated they were from Western Pennsylvania. Crosby scored to give the Penguins a first period lead, <b>but</b> <b>Washington</b> scored two goals before {{the conclusion of the}} period. Mark Eaton tied the game in the second period, but Washington's Semyon Varlamov held the Penguins scoreless {{for the remainder of the}} game as the Capitals took a 1–0 lead in the series. The game had 40%more viewers than playoff games the previous season. In Game 2, Ovechkin and Crosby scored three goals each, though Dave Steckel's second period goal was the difference as Washington won 4–3.|$|E
5|$|In 1792, {{with their}} {{relationship}} completely ruptured, Jefferson unsuccessfully {{tried to convince}} Washington to remove Hamilton, <b>but</b> <b>Washington</b> largely supported Hamilton's ideas, believing that they had led to social and economic stability. Dissonance over Hamilton's proposals also irrevocably broke the relationship between Washington and Madison, who had served as the president's foremost congressional ally {{during the first year}} of his presidency. Opponents of Hamilton and the administration won several seats in the 1792 Congressional elections, and Hamilton was unable to win Congressional approval of his ambitious economic proposals afterward.|$|E

5|$|Other {{problems}} {{affected the}} quantity and quality of his forces. Many of his men's enlistments were due to expire before Christmas, and many soldiers were inclined to leave the army when their commission ended. Several deserted before their enlistments were up. The pending loss of forces, the series of lost battles, the loss of New York, the flight of the Army along with many New Yorkers and the Second Continental Congress to Philadelphia, left many in doubt about the prospects of winning the war. <b>But</b> <b>Washington</b> persisted. He successfully procured supplies and dispatched men to recruit new members of the militia, which was successful in part due to British and Hessian mistreatment of New Jersey and Pennsylvania residents.|$|E
5|$|Washington had {{established}} his preeminence {{among the new}} nation's Founding Fathers through his service as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War and {{as president of the}} 1787 Constitutional Convention. Once the Constitution was approved, it was widely expected that Washington would become the first President of the United States, despite his own desire to retire from public life. In his first inaugural address expressed both his reluctance to accept the presidency and his inexperience with the duties of civil administration, <b>but</b> <b>Washington</b> proved an able leader.|$|E
5|$|His {{basketball}} {{performance in}} high school was unimpressive. He came off the bench to average four points per game (ppg). His stepmother informed him that when he graduated high school he would be {{thrown out of the}} house. Chris had been able to leave home on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, <b>but</b> <b>Washington</b> himself had nowhere to go. He trained for three hours a day {{toward the end of his}} senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at Maryland University to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1987, in Chicago's {{municipal}} elections, Vrdolyak, rather than seeking re-election as alderman, was the Solidarity Party's candidate challenging Washington for mayor. Washington won re-election, and Washington allies won twenty-five City Council seats. Burke led opposition in the City Council, <b>but</b> <b>Washington</b> supporter Alderman Timothy C. Evans replaced Burke as Chairman of the Committee on Finance. Ousted from the spacious Finance Committee staff offices, Burke never used the relatively modest office allocated to him in City Hall and instead worked out of his private law office two blocks away. In the days {{following the death of}} Mayor Washington in office, Burke supported the Council's selection of Alderman Eugene Sawyer over Evans to serve as mayor. Sawyer prevailed, but Burke was the alderman who least often voted in support of the legislative agenda of Mayor Sawyer, Chicago's second black mayor. After Richard M. Daley was elected mayor in {{the spring of}} 1989, Daley nominated Burke as Finance chairman, a position he has held ever since.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, British ships {{continued}} to arrive. On August 1, 45 ships arrived with generals Henry Clinton and Charles Cornwallis, along with 3,000 troops. By August 12, 3,000 more British troops and another 8,000 Hessians had arrived. At this point, the British fleet numbered over 400 ships, including 73 war ships, and 32,000 troops were camped on Staten Island. Faced with this large force, Washington was unsure {{as to where}} the British would attack. Both Greene and Reed thought that the British would attack Long Island, <b>but</b> <b>Washington</b> felt that a British attack on Long Island might be a diversion for the main attack on Manhattan. He broke his army in half, stationing half of it on Manhattan, {{and the other half}} on Long Island; the army on Long Island was commanded by Greene. On August 20, Greene became ill and was forced to move to a house in Manhattan where he rested to recover. John Sullivan was placed in command until Greene was well enough to resume command.|$|E
5|$|On {{their first}} {{play of the}} second quarter, Navy scored a {{touchdown}} on a pass play from Ira McKee to Carl Cullen. McKee kicked the extra point for Navy, giving them a 7–0 lead. In an attempt to trick Washington, Navy tried an onside kick on the next play, <b>but</b> <b>Washington</b> recovered the ball. After two short running plays, Washington quarterback Fred Abel completed a 23-yard pass to running back Kinsley Dubois, bringing Washington inside the 25-yard line. On the next play, running back George Wilson ran the ball 23 yards for a touchdown. Washington's kicker converted the extra point {{to tie the game}} at 7–7. After several drives from each team that did not result in further scoring, Navy completed a 57-yard pass down to the Washington eight-yard line. Two plays later, Ira McKee ran the ball in from two yards out for a touchdown, then afterward converted the extra point. The first half ended with Navy leading by 147, having completed all 11passes they attempted.|$|E

25|$|<b>But</b> <b>Washington</b> Airport {{was only}} {{marginally}} safer than Hoover Field. Arlington Beach, a local amusement park with a Ferris wheel and high rollercoasters, was located {{to the northeast}} (on the downstream side of Highway Bridge), and a landfill existed on the eastern side. The trash in the landfill was also on fire. The smoke sometimes obscured the landing field, and the stench was notorious through the city of Washington.

25|$|Pirates {{operating}} from Aceh threatened commerce in the Strait of Malacca; the sultan {{was unable to}} control them.

The Dutch colonial government declared war on Aceh on 26 March 1873. Aceh sought American help <b>but</b> <b>Washington</b> rejected the request.|$|E

25|$|The Cowboys scored first after a 75-yard drive {{led to a}} 27-yard {{field goal}} by kicker Rafael Septién. <b>But</b> <b>Washington</b> then scored on a 9-play, 84-yard {{possession}} to take the lead. Riggins rushed for 32 yards on the drive, while Theismann capped {{it off with a}} 19-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Charlie Brown. In the second quarter, a pair of completions by Theismann and 24 more yards from Riggins moved the Redskins into scoring range, only to have kicker Mark Moseley miss a 27-yard field goal.|$|E
25|$|The July 1790 Residence Act named Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the {{temporary}} national capital for a 10-year period while the Federal City was under construction. The City of Philadelphia rented Robert Morris's city house at 190 High Street (now 524–30 Market Street) for Washington's presidential residence. The first president occupied the Market Street mansion from November 1790 to March 1797, and altered it {{in ways that}} may have influenced {{the design of the}} White House. As part of a futile effort to have Philadelphia named the permanent national capital, Pennsylvania built a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away, <b>but</b> <b>Washington</b> declined to occupy it.|$|E
25|$|Line KR {{officers}} did {{not want}} to immediately arrest all the KGB personnel identified by Ames and Hanssen because they {{did not want}} to draw the attention of the CIA and FBI (which it did).

25|$|Instead, President Johnson {{sought a}} way out of the {{commitment}} that he had originally escalated. Politically, this was a little late in coming, <b>but</b> <b>Washington</b> had finally woken to the dire predicament it found itself embroiled in. Johnson attempted to get Hanoi to reopen serious peace negotiations and the carrot in this attempt was the cessation of all U.S. operations against North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel. Hanoi had only sought an end to the air campaign against the north (Operation Rolling Thunder), but Johnson went one further by calling a halt to all northern operations, both overt and covert. This order effectively ended MACSOG's agent team, propaganda, and aerial operations.|$|E
25|$|Washington Airport {{was built}} because a newly formed airline needed a {{terminal}} in Washington, D.C. The new Washington Airport opened without fanfare in late 1927 {{as a field}} for sight-seeing planes. Its owners included Robert E. Funkhouser (an investor in various airlines), Herbert Fahy (a well-known Lockheed Aircraft Company test pilot), and other investors. The airport added acreage and improved its facilities, and in February 1928 Funkhouser, Fahy and the others formed Seaboard Airways. Seaboard's base of operations was Washington Airport. <b>But</b> <b>Washington</b> Airport was only marginally safer than Hoover Field. The owners {{could not afford to}} pave the runway, and the burning trash dumps near Hoover Field and at Washington Airport's own eastern border often obscured the new field's runways.|$|E
25|$|His near miracle comeback, {{combined}} with Simms' injury, {{earned him the}} starting position for his final game at Texas, the 2001 Holiday Bowl and he didn't disappoint. In perhaps his finest game, he led Texas from behind three times throwing for a school record 473 yards and four touchdowns. In a fourth quarter aerial assault, Texas scored 23 points in a little over 10 minutes to take the lead, <b>but</b> <b>Washington</b> {{would come back to}} take the lead once more. With 1:49 left in the game, Applewhite engineered a 7 play, 80 yard touchdown drive with passes of 25 and 37 yards to win the game. He was named the Holiday Bowl MVP as a result. He finished with a record as a starter of 22-8.|$|E
