25|$|Since 2000, Rob Reger has <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{a feature}} film {{adaptation}} of Emily. In 2005, {{it was reported that}} Fox Animation would make a live action/animated feature film, with Chris Meledandri and John Cohen producing it. In 2008, it was reported that Mike Richardson, of Dark Horse Entertainment, had come on board as a producer. The same year it was unofficially reported that the film had moved to Universal Studios' owned Illumination Entertainment, along with the studio's founders, Meledandri and Cohen. In September 2010, it was reported that Universal Studios had acquired the rights to the comic, and that the actress Chloë Grace Moretz had been cast in the role of Emily. In August 2011, it was announced that Melisa Wallack, who wrote the script for Mirror Mirror, had been hired to write the adaptation. Two months later it was confirmed that the film was indeed in the works at Illumination Entertainment. Kealan O’Rourke will rewrite the film's script. In December 2016, it was reported that Universal had abandoned the project, and that Dark Horse Entertainment and Amazon Studios were in negotiations to make an animated film.|$|E

[...] "We had some great stuff go on with the first record, but I think the biggest thing {{over the past two years}} has <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure Satisfied is not a sophomore slump" [...] said lead guitarist Brian Bunn. [...] While the self-titled album was written and recorded with little thought to how the songs would translate in concert, the experience of opening for Third Day helped DecembeRadio learn what works best live. [...] Thus it was the band's goal to [...] "make sure every single song on the [...] album worked well in a live concert setting", according to Bunn.|$|E

2500|$|The next week, in episodes {{broadcast}} from 9 to 13 July 2012, Jack and Max both witness Kat dancing sexily with Ray, {{and they are}} judgemental of her, which Inside Soap said could be because {{one of them is}} jealous, and Jack keeps [...] "making eyes" [...] at Kat, which could be more revealing than Kat's own actions. They later said that Kat would probably not dance with Ray like that if she was trying to keep an affair with him secret, especially in front of Kim, and said she could have <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> either Max or Jack jealous. All About Soap also thought Jack might be jealous, and when he asks Ray if any [...] "hot women" [...] are going to his party, Jack looks at Kat, which they thought could be because Jack hopes Kat will be there. The [...] "sexy dance" [...] between Ray and Kat was interpreted to be either evidence or a red herring, but Inside Soap noted that Kat seems keen to be around Ray. The fact she dances so close to Ray in front of Kim could mean Ray is not her secret lover, but she enjoys danger so may be willing to make a show of herself despite the risk. Kat also tells Kim she is [...] "lucky to have found her prince", which All About Soap thought might mean Kat is jealous, and made him their favourite suspect of the fortnight.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Rolling Stone gave Bittersweet World {{three out}} of five stars in its review, saying that Simpson had [...] "skillfully shift her crunchy, guitar-driven pop to eighties-influenced electro-rock {{with the help of}} Timbaland and the Neptunes' Chad Hugo." [...] People gave the album a very positive review, with three and a half out of four stars; it described Bittersweet World as [...] "shockingly good" [...] and as [...] "sweet revenge on all [...] critics", and it noted the album's [...] "dance-pop direction". Entertainment Weekly compared Simpson's [...] "latest incarnation" [...] to Gwen Stefani, but it gave the album a positive review and a [...] "B" [...] rating, saying that the album was filled with [...] "polished hooks and pretty melodies" [...] and had a [...] "giddy neon energy". Billboard said that on Bittersweet World, Simpson [...] "just wants to have a good time", and, in an ambivalent appraisal, said that the album [...] "is a party worth attending, but not much is missed if your invite got lost in the mail." [...] According to The New York Times, the album features [...] "songs with crisp beats, teen-seeking choruses and cheerfully obvious lyrics", and is both [...] "calculated" [...] and [...] "catchy". The Houston Chronicle gave the album a positive review and {{three out of}} four stars, emphasizing its '80s influence and saying that, [...] "at its best, Bittersweet World plays like the solo record Gwen Stefani has <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> for years.". The Dallas Morning News gave the album a B rating, describing it as [...] "seductively inauthentic" [...] but also saying that Simpson was [...] "more listenable than ever". Digital Spy called the album [...] "Easily the best album made by a Simpson sister".|$|E

2500|$|As well as {{resulting}} trusts, {{where the}} courts have presumed that the transferor would have intended the property return, there are resulting trusts which arise by automatic operation of the law. A key example is where property is transferred to a trustee, but too much is handed over. The surplus will be held by the recipient on a resulting trust. For example, in the Privy Council case of Air Jamaica Ltd v Charlton an airline's pension plan was overfunded, so that all employees could be paid the benefits that they were due under their employment contracts, but a surplus remained. The company argued that it should receive the money, because it had attempted to amend the scheme's terms, and the Jamaican government argued that it should receive the money, as bona vacantia because the scheme's original terms had stated money was not {{to return to the}} company, and the employees had all received their entitlements. However, the Privy Council advised both were wrong and the money should return to those who had made contributions to the fund: half the company and half the employees, on resulting trust. This was in response, according to Lord Millett, [...] "to the absence of any intention on his part to pass a beneficial interest to the recipient." [...] In a similar pattern, it was held in Vandervell v Inland Revenue Commissioners that an option to repurchase shares in a company was held on resulting trust for Mr Vandervell when he declared the option to be held by his family trustees, but did not say who he meant the option to be held on trust for. Mr Vandervell had <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a gift of £250,000 to the Royal College of Surgeons without paying any transfer tax, and thought that he could do it if he transferred the College some shares in his company, let the company pay out enough dividends, and then bought the shares back. However, the Income Tax Act 1952 section 415(2), applied a tax to a settlor of a trust for any income made out of trusts, if the settlor retained any interest whatsoever. Because Mr Vandervell did not say who the option was meant to be for, the House of Lords concluded the option was held on trust for him, and therefore he was taxed. It has also been said, that trusts which arise when one person gives property to another for a reason, but then the reason fails, as in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd are resulting in nature. However, Lord Millett in his judgment in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley' ',(dissenting on the knowing receipt point, leading on the Quistclose point) recategorised the trust which arises as an immediate express trust {{for the benefit of the}} transferor, albeit with a mandate upon the recipient to apply the assets for a purpose stated in the contract.|$|E
