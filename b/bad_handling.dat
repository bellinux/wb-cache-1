25|$|Platinum coins are {{a popular}} investment, {{and each year}} {{the number of such}} coins sold by Sberbank of Russia {{increases}} by 30–50%. Most experts agree that such investments should have a long-term character, as the rise of the platinum price is relatively slow– about 80% over the last 5 years, except for a rapid rise followed by decline in 2008. Also, whereas most banks can sell platinum coins, only a few buy them, as this requires evaluation by an experienced professional. For example, only 5% of offices of Sberbank (the major bank of Russia) in the capital city of Moscow redeem precious metal coins. The selling price is also much affected by visible scratches, spots, patina, and other defects introduced by <b>bad</b> <b>handling.</b> For this reason, most bullion coins are sealed in transparent plastic right after removal from the press. They are then stored in a dry room with relative humidity below 80% and at temperatures between 15 and 40°C. If a coin is removed from its plastic seal, it is recommended not to store it in PVC albums, as PVC molecules gradually break down, releasing organochlorine compounds which produce patina on the coins. These compounds may also form acids by reacting with moisture. Unlike silver, platinum does not corrode. However, as is true for all unprotected coins, platinum coins are prone to contamination which can be caused even by washing with (chlorine-containing) tap water.|$|E

50|$|A {{total of}} 55 PV-1s {{were used by}} the RAAF in the South West Pacific Area, serving {{primarily}} in New Guinea. A large order of new machines from the RAF in 1939 meant Lockheed could readily supply to the RAAF. Only the RAAF used them in front line combat, bombing the north coast of New Guinea. Initially, air crews and ground staff disliked the Ventura, preferring the North American B-25 Mitchell. But in many cases, the PV-1 had developed a grudging respect from its operators. More RAAF machines were lost on the ground than in the air, both from attack and the <b>bad</b> <b>handling</b> characteristics at landing speeds. They were replaced by other more capable machines, including B-24s, and DAP Beauforts and Beaufighters.|$|E
5000|$|The Soret band arises {{primarily}} due to {{an electron}} dipole movement that allows π-π* transitions; most common in porphyrin compounds. Most analytical studies of porphyrincontaining moiety can be done using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and exciting wavelength at the respective Soret band wavelength. For example, the [...] "Soret peak" [...] is {{used to describe the}} absorption of vividly-pigmented heme-containing moieties, such as various cytochromes. For example, the cytochromes P450, a diverse class of monooxygenase enzymes, exhibit a Soret peak at 450 nm in their reduced form when saturated with carbon monoxide. This is called a CO difference spectrum assay: the absorbance spectrum of the solution is subtracted from the spectrum after saturation with carbon monoxide. If the P450 has been denatured, for example due to <b>bad</b> <b>handling,</b> the peak shifts to 420 nm. It is possible to see both 420 nm and 450 nm peaks on the same spectrum if only a portion of the P450 has been denatured.|$|E

30|$|Some pixels {{respond to}} {{radiation}} {{which is so}} different compared to the rest that it is required to classify them as noninformation-bearing pixels, the bad pixels. The algorithm chosen for <b>bad</b> pixel <b>handling</b> is that of[30] with some minor changes. More sophisticated algorithms have been proposed (see for example[31]), but in this article, a simple <b>bad</b> pixel <b>handling</b> {{is assumed to be}} sufficient. Each pixel in the flat field is compared to the median of its neighbors (15 [*]×[*] 15 px kernel). If the absolute deviation from the median is larger than 2.9 standard deviations, it is classified as a bad pixel. Typically, around 3 % are classified as bad (fixed bad pixel map); this is expected and is caused by the special kind of scintillator used. As a third pre-processing step, each pixel labeled as bad is then substituted in the current radiograph by the median value of its neighbors (5 × 5 px kernel). Often, there are clusters of bad pixels, and of course, any indication at the same size and inside such a cluster would be averaged away. In the fourth and final pre-processing step, the pixels are averaged 2 [*]×[*] 2 into pixel size 0.027 mm (binned) to increase the CNR at the cost of resolution.|$|R
40|$|A new {{algorithm}} called Channel-Coded Optimal Estimation (CCOE) {{is adapted}} to a CELP speech codec. The CCOE-algorithm performs joint source-channel decoding by optimal estimation using bit-reliability informations (soft-bits) and source statistics. The basic algorithm for a simple transmission scenario with a single scalar quantizer has been recently stated by the author. In this paper the basic idea is extended for the use in a CELP speech-codec that was developed for enhanced speech transmission in the GSM mobile radio channel. Simu- lation results based on informal listening tests are given which show that the new algorithm achieves substantial gains over separate error correction with hard decisions prior to source decoding and classical techniques for error detection and <b>bad</b> frame <b>handling</b> as widely {{used in the present}} mobile-radio systems...|$|R

The first 44 security notices issued by Ubuntu can be categorized to show that 41% of vulnerabilities stem from buffer overflows, 11% from integer overflows, and 16% from other <b>bad</b> <b>handling</b> of malformed data. These types of bugs often open the possibility to inject and execute foreign code, or execute existing code out of order, and make up 61% of the sample group, discarding overlap. (This is a crude analysis; a more comprehensive analysis of individual vulnerabilities would be likely to give very different numbers.)Many worms, viruses, and attempts to take over a machine rely on changing the contents of memory so that the malware code is executed; or on executing [...] "data" [...] contents by misdirection. If execution of such malware could be blocked, it could do little or even no damage even after being installed on a computer; many, such as the Sasser worm, could be prevented from being installed at all.|$|E
50|$|The {{first race}} of the 1974 season was the 1974 Argentine Grand Prix. Surtees entered two cars for Brazilian José Carlos Pace and German Jochen Mass but both drivers retired, Pace with {{suspension}} failure and Mass with engine failure. At Brazil The Brazilian finished fourth to please his home crowd and the German was 17th, The South African Grand Prix saw Pace finish 11th and Mass retire with suspension failure. At Spain the Brazilian finished 13th and the German retired with a broken gearbox. Both drivers retired at the Belgian Grand Prix, Pace with a <b>bad</b> <b>handling</b> car and Mass with suspension failure. at Monaco Mass did not start and Pace {{was involved in a}} collision towards Massenet with Jean-Pierre Beltoise (BRM), Denny Hulme (McLaren), Arturo Merzario (Iso-Marlboro), Vittorio Brambilla (March Engineering), Brian Redman (Shadow) and Tim Schenken (Trojan). Both drivers retired at the Swedish Grand Prix, Pace with a <b>bad</b> <b>handling</b> car and Mass with suspension failure. Pace parted company with the team after the race, falling out with team boss and designer, John Surtees. The team only entered Mass for Holland who retired with transmission failure. Mass retired with clutch failure at the French Grand Prix and new teammate José Dolhem disappointed the home crowd by failing to qualify. Dolhem was replaced at the Britain by Englishman Derek Bell but he disappointed the home crowd by failing to qualify and the German finished 14th. The German Grand Prix saw Bell 11th and Mass retire with engine failure to disappointing his home crowd. Mass was replaced by Frenchman Jean-Pierre Jabouille for Austria but he and the Englishman failed to qualify. The team also entered Austrian Dieter Quester who finished ninth. Dolhem and Bell failed to qualify for the Italian Grand Prix. Dolhem was replaced by Austrian Helmuth Koinigg for Canada who finished tenth but Bell failed to qualify. Bell was replaced by Dolhem for the United States Grand Prix who withdrew on lap twenty five after Koinigg crashed on lap ten probably due to a deflating rear tire. On impact with the Armco barrier, the bottom rail gave way but the top one did not, and Koinigg had no chance and was decapitated. Surtees ended the season in 11th with three points but low on money for 1975, the team pared back to a single car for Englishman John Watson.|$|E
