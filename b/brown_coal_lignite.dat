50|$|Potassium humate is the {{potassium}} salt of humic acid. It is manufactured commercially by alkaline extraction of <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> (<b>lignite)</b> Leonardite {{to be used}} mainly as a soil conditioner. The extraction is performed in water {{with the addition of}} potassium hydroxide (KOH), sequestering agents and hydrotropic surfactants. Heat is used to increase the solubility of humic acids and hence more potassium humate can be extracted. The resulting liquid is dried to produce the amorphous crystalline like product which can then be added as a granule to fertiliser. The potassium humate granules by way of chemical extraction lose their hydrophobic properties and are now soluble. Depending on the source material product quality varies. High quality oxidised lignite (brown coal), usually referred to as leonardite, is the best source material for extraction of large quantities of potassium humate. The less oxidised the coal the less potassium humate extracted. Sources low in ash produce the best quality. Less oxidised brown coal contains a higher proportion of the insoluble humin fraction and along with peat which is lower in humic acid content and usually high in ash content requires separation by filtration or centrifugation to remove ash, humin. Peat is also high in non humified organic matter that needs to be reduced to produce a high quality product. The benefit of peat is that it is usually 2-3 times higher in fulvic acid content, which are the low molecular weight fractions of humic acid that are high in oxygen containing functional groups and soluble at a low pH of <1. Fulvic acids have a higher cation exchange capacity and therefore have a higher chemical interaction with fertilisers and are able to form soluble chelates of trace metals.|$|E

40|$|The {{significant}} and consistent use of coal {{as a major}} source for power generation results in the emissions of various hazardous trace elements into the environment. Coupled with the advancement of oxyfuel combustion, a promising CO₂ abatement technology, there is a pressing need to fully understand trace element behaviour. Therefore, this research project aims at contributing towards fundamental understanding regarding the mechanisms governing the behaviour of trace elements under the conditions that are typically encountered in <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> air and oxyfuel combustion. To address literature gaps regarding trace element emissions and partitioning, both laboratory-scale and pilot-scale studies have been conducted. The highlight of these studies is the focused use of <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> (<b>lignites),</b> e. g. Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> (VBC), due to the limited knowledge for these coals which possess distinct properties and burns differently from high-rank coals that have been studied intensively in the literature. In terms of mode of occurrence in the original coal, trace elements in <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> are mostly organically bound rather than being present in discrete minerals typical {{to that of other}} high-rank coals. For these coals, a wide variety of trace elements have been examined, including As, Ba, Be, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, V, and Zn. Of these, As and Cr are highlighted as elements of major environmental concern based on their known adverse health and ecological effects. These two elements are studied in greater detail since their speciation affects their toxicity. To accomplish trace element quantification and characterisation for these purposes, a number of advanced analytical instruments and methods were utilised, including inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The scope of this thesis includes firstly establishing and standardising the trace element quantification analysis method, microwave-assisted digestion performed in conjunction with ICP-OES, for accurate communication of the main body results. The laboratory-scale studies, which utilises a drop-tube furnace, then compare the trace element behaviour derived from a VBC to that from a Chinese lignite. For this, the emission dynamics of their respective trace elements during pyrolysis and char oxidation, different stages of the coal combustion process, were studied in both air and oxyfuel gaseous environments. Further to that, the laboratory-scale studies encompass the additional focus on the emission and speciation of As and Cr. For the study on As, three coals of different type and origin were tested for its As valency using the synchrotron-based XANES during coal combustion in air and oxyfuel combustion mode. On the other hand, the novel study on Cr mechanisms for speciation involved monitoring the evolution of Cr species from reacting reagent-grade compounds using in-situ high-temperature XRD. Finally, as means to validate the laboratory-scale results on a larger-scale, the Chinese lignite was then subjected to air combustion in a pilot-scale 30 MWth pulverised coal-fired boiler. Here, a side objective of this work was to investigate the effects of using a silica additive on the emissions and partitioning of trace elements in <b>brown</b> <b>coal.</b> The use of fuel additives is commonly adopted by various facilities as they have been proven to inhibit ash slagging and fouling issues, however, their effects on trace element emissions have not been fully documented. Overall, clarifying trace element emissions and partitioning behaviour is of mainstream interest, and this research ultimately provide a clearer picture for the management of trace elements derived from the use of <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> for power generation...|$|R
40|$|The use of low rank coals in coal-to-products {{processes}} is {{of particular}} interest for countries with significant domestic resources, including Australia and Germany. Significant advances have been made in coal-derived syngas generation, and high temperature, entrained flow gasification of high rank coals is currently state of the art. Despite their advantageous properties, low rank coals such as Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> and Rhenish <b>lignites</b> have yet to be thoroughly investigated for coal-to-products processes via high temperature entrained flow gasification. This is the first publicly available investigation on entrained flow gasification of Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coals.</b> In this research, a series of interrelated studies of the fuel-dependent processes which occur during entrained flow gasification of these fuels was performed. To facilitate the high temperature part of the investigation, a fit-for-purpose apparatus was designed, implemented and utilised to assess the suitability, behaviour and potential process issues related to the entrained flow gasification of Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> and Rhenish <b>lignites.</b> Fundamental kinetics analysis was performed by thermogravimetry of Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> chars generated under rapid, entrained flow pyrolysis conditions and indicated that a fuel-specific optimum pyrolysis temperature exists under which the most reactive char for a particular coal is produced. Kinetic data were produced for each coal relating to the rate limiting, heterogeneous char gasification reactions, and the major factors influencing char gasification reactivity with CO₂ and steam were shown to be char morphology and catalytic inorganic constituents, respectively. The release and reaction mechanisms of volatile inorganic species from Victorian and Rhenish coals under CO₂ and steam gasification conditions were investigated by molecular beam mass spectrometry. The mechanisms under different atmospheres were shown to be distinct but related, and separate pyrolysis and gasification phases were observed. The majority of volatilisation occurred during the pyrolysis phase, and was independent of the gasification atmosphere. The NaCl – NaOH and H₂S – COS equilibria showed opposite trends under CO₂ and steam atmospheres. A competitive, cyclic, mechanism involving Na, Ca, S, Si and Al was derived, which results in permanent capture of various species depending on the absence, presence and local partial pressure of the gasification reagent. Low temperature (< 1000 °C) entrained flow gasification of a Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> resulted in an increase in syngas yield and decrease in hydrocarbon contaminants with increasing temperature, indicating that tar-free product gas may be expected at higher temperatures. The low temperature assessment confirmed the need for high temperature trials as the char conversion was low (< 55 %) and the syngas contaminant levels high at the maximum possible conditions of 1000 °C and 6 s residence time. A fuel-flexible, high temperature, entrained flow reactor - The HELENA - was therefore designed and commissioned and a comprehensive matrix of pyrolysis and gasification trials conducted using Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> and Rhenish <b>lignite.</b> Based on the results of this research, the high temperature, entrained flow gasification of these fuels was determined to be technically feasible, and some important operational considerations were highlighted. High reactivity chars were produced at all temperatures up to 1400 °C, tar generation from all coals was negligible at high temperatures, and char conversions of up to 99 % were achieved. Efficient carbon conversion, high throughput and tar-free syngas may therefore be expected under industrial conditions. The maximum char reactivity for the Victorian coal was observed at 1200 °C, confirming that there exists a fuel-dependant optimum gasification temperature and highlighting the potential for use of Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> in moderate temperature, entrained flow apparatus with suitable ash handling systems. The Victorian coal was more reactive than the Rhenish coal under all conditions, possibly due to the low ash melting temperature of the Rhenish coal which can impede gas transfer to reactive carbon sites within the char structure. Slight agglomeration of the Rhenish coal was also observed at low conversion, and significant particle size reduction for both fuels was observed for high conversion experiments. Ammonia was not detected under the conditions tested. However, HCN, H₂S and COS contaminants increased with increasing temperature to ppmv levels at 1400 °C. Through this research, a comprehensive assessment of the high temperature, entrained flow gasification behaviour of Victorian <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> and Rhenish <b>lignite</b> has been performed using proven experimental techniques under conditions of industrial interest. The generated data provide optimums, limits and trends which are applicable and comparable in their own right, and may also be used as direct inputs to process modelling, design and optimisation of large scale applications. Furthermore, the design and implementation of the HELENA serves both current and future requirements for a dedicated, fuel-flexible, high temperature apparatus to facilitate the continuation of research in this field...|$|R
