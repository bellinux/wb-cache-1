5|$|Outer space, also simply called space, {{refers to}} the {{relatively}} empty regions of the universe outside the atmospheres of celestial bodies.

Outer space within the Solar System is called interplanetary space, which passes over into interstellar space at {{what is known as}} the heliopause.|$|E

5|$|The {{distribution}} of archaeological finds {{suggests that the}} western end of the river between Bath and Avonmouth formed a border between the Dobunni and Durotriges during the late Iron Age, prior to the Roman conquest of Britain.
