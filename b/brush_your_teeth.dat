40|$|Introduction: The {{toothbrush}} is an {{oral hygiene}} tool used {{to clean the}} teeth and gums. Toothbrushes have important everyday role because of personal oral hygiene. Proper toothbrush care is important for oral health. Tooth brushing is fundamental to oral hygiene. Brushing helps to remove plaque and food. With simple removing the plaque of the teeth we actively prevent cavities and other periodontal diseases from appearance in the oral environment. It {{is very important to}} know properly how to <b>brush</b> <b>your</b> <b>teeth,</b> to remove the plaque and prevent further deposition of it. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} note the plenty of toothbrushes that everyone uses nowadays.

Most believe that toothpaste is the main factor in the removal of plaque while in all actuality it is the toothbrush. In fact just using your tooth brush to <b>brush</b> <b>your</b> <b>teeth</b> is nine percent more effective at removing plaque than brushing with toothpaste according to clinical trials. Floss is also a main factor in the removal of plaque as it is actually going in between the teeth and making contact with the gums. So for this innovation aloe was utilized for the prevention of plaque buildup on the and in between the teeth. Aloe was added to products that clean in between the teeth such as, floss and picks. Aloe has been used in other oral care techniques but has not been used for the reduction of plaque buildup. The reduction of plaque by aloe is believed to be plausible because it has antibacterial properties. These properties were tested in the lab and the Dentaloe Picks were made and tested to determine if there was a viable market for the innovation...|$|E

In this work experimental activities on microbiology {{were carried out}} by the 16 pupils of a Portuguese grade- 4 classroom (9 - 10 years old) and were focused on two problem-questions related to microbiology and health: (I) Do your teeth have microbes? (II) Why should you <b>brush</b> <b>your</b> <b>teeth</b> after meals? To solve problem-question (I) children’s samples of dental plaque were prepared and observed under the microscope. For question (II) culture medium plates were inoculated with children’s dental plaque either before or after tooth brushing and the colonies counted. Results showed that pupils recognized easily the presence of microorganisms in the mouth and verified the effectiveness of the process of tooth brushing. Pupils understood straightforwardly that microorganisms were potentially responsible for the onset of dental caries. These practical activities on microbiology in primary school showed to be very effective for young children understand easily the causes of dental caries and how they can be prevented. Pupils became aware that the act of brushing their teeth is not only a socially correct behaviour or a simple rule to meet, but also a matter of preventing illness and promoting health.

40|$|Knowledge is {{important}} for us, human beings, {{for a variety of}} reasons, starting with trivial but necessary reasons to live your life (knowing not to cross the street when the traffic light is red, knowing that water quenches thirst, knowing where you left your bicycle last night, knowing how to buy a train ticket, knowing how to <b>brush</b> <b>your</b> <b>teeth,</b> etc. etc.). Western man also has a collective project that is constitutive of its culture: science; and the aim of science is to gather knowledge about the world in its broadest meaning: from the origin of a particular disease to the origin of man, life, planet Earth and the universe, from why the orbits move as they do to why a mass of people behaves differently from individuals, from why the sky is blue to why the sea is salty, from why the climate seems to change to why rainbows appear, etc. etc. The quest to understand what knowledge is, is as old as philosophy itself, and the philosophy of knowledge is called epistemology. The substantive ‘knowledge’ and the verb ‘to know’ are used in a variety of manners: we can know a person, we can know how to ride a bicycle and we can know that snow is white. The last-mentioned use, propositional knowledge (knowing that p, where p is proposition), is the most pervasive use and has been the main focus of philosophers. Already in the Meno, Plato raises a question how someone knowing that p differs from thinking that p is true when p is true.

40|$|Behavior is generatil'e, {{by which}} I {{mean that it}} is probabilistic, {{continuous}} in time, and always novel. At first glance, B. F. Skinner's work would seem {{to make contact with}} generative aspects ofbehavior, since he studied the "emitted " behavior of ''freely moving organisms, " since he analyzed language, mu-sic, literature, and other creative activities, and since he him-selfwas an exceptionally creative individual. Infact, Skinner's 1 V 0 rkfocuses on the effects ofvarious interventions Oil ongoing behavior; it says little about where that behavior comes from in the first place. Generativity theory suggests that simple behav-ioral processes of the sort Skinner studied operate simulta-neously on the probabilities ofa large number ofdifferent be-haviors. Instaflliated in a computer model, the theory has successfully emulated complex, nOl'eJ performances in both hu-man and animal subjects. and it may some day allow for the real-time simulation ofnovel performances in individual human subjects.

40|$|Background: Teeth {{and mouth}} {{diseases}} {{have been founded}} in many communities. It called dental caries. According to Household Health Survey 1997, has mentioned that 63 % of the Indonesia population to suffer active dental caries or has not been handled. In further analysis which analyzed the factors related to caries {{in the community of}} Indonesia. Several factors associated with caries are characteristics of respondents, sweet eating, and tooth brushing habits. Instruments taken from the questionnaires of Riskesdas 2007 : RKD 07. RT (Block I, Block IV), RKD 07. IND (Teeth and mouth: B 25, 26, 27, 28), hygienic behavior: (D 10 a, 10 b), behavior of consumption: (d 35 a), and Measurement and Inspection-Dentogram. Methods: The data analysis performed using Univariate, Bivariate, and Logistic Regression. Before the analysis, it has conducted weigth. Based on research results, indicated that individual characteristics (age, education, housing, social and economic) associated with the occurrence of caries, therefore higher level of education, and level of social economic, hence there were tendency to have fewer caries above average (> 2). Chi-Square test was a significant relationship. Result: Moreover, types of respondents who lived in the city at risk of caries are greater than living in the village. Communities often consume sweet foods tend to occur more caries compared with a eat pattern of fibrous foods. In addition, respondents who have a tendency to <b>brush</b> <b>your</b> <b>teeth</b> caries occurrence are lighter than that does not brush their teeth. For that suggested the need for information about the eat patterns can reduce the occurrence of caries, as well as increased efforts to maintain dental health within the community who had been very low. Research and information about medicinal plants that can be used by the public as an antiseptic teeth and mouth can reduce the occurrence of dental caries. School Efforts for Oral Health (UKGS) and Dental Health Programs in the community need to be increased so that the prevalence of caries can be reduced.

There are those of us whose first instinct at the start of the day is to grab that little device and see what occurred during our non-waking hours. Perhaps we check the email that's flooded into our inbox overnight. Next we check Facebook, Twitter, or a favorite news app to catch up on the latest global occurrence. It seems that for many, this desire to check is increasingly irresistible. Regulatory Focus Theory (Higgins, 1997) and Regulatory Mode Theory (Kruglanski et al, 2000) suggest that the reasons behind this drive to check and stay connected may differ based upon our motivational tendencies. Our motivational orientation [...] promotion or prevention, assessment or locomotion impacts our lives in countless ways. We know that the effects of motivational orientation play out across career paths, management styles, parenting, negotiations, animal behavior, health and wellness, romantic relationships and the list goes on. Regulatory focus and mode have not yet, however, been applied to our relatively new obsession with mobile technology, which is a space that is rapidly evolving and shaping much of our physical, social, and emotional world. This research aims to understand two key questions: 1. What motivates the constant checking behavior that has become an inherent part of our daily life? 2. How does our subjective experience with such behavior impact our general well-being? Using a within subjects, longitudinal design of 740 demographically representative Americans, we extracted two separate, yet complimentary stories that encompass objective smartphone checking behavior (captured through native application passive meter technology) and the subjective smartphone experience (assessed via 18 self-report questions surrounding smartphone engagement). Our results suggest that it is in fact our motivational approach to life that fuels our need to stay connected. However, it means something different depending upon what motivations are involved.

40|$|AIM OF THE STUDY To {{describe}} {{prevalence and}} severity of periodontal diseases among urban and rural 11 - 15 year-olds in Lithuania and to evaluate risk factors, prevention and treatment needs. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY 1. 	To evaluate oral hygiene among 11 - 15 year-old schoolchildren and to describe dependence on gender, age, parients‘ education and living area. 2. 	To evaluate freequence of complaints of the bleeding gingiva among 11 - 15 year-old schoolchildren and to describe dependence on gender, age and living area. 3. 	To evaluate the dependence of freequence of complaints of the bleeding gingiva on oral higiene, living style and parients‘ education. 4. 	To describe prevalence {{and severity of}} periodontal diseases among urban and rural 11 - 15 year-old schoolchildren and to elucidate relation with local risk factors and oral hygiene. 5. 	T o evaluate treatment needs of periodontal diseases among urban and rural 11 - 15 year-old schoolchildren. 6. 	To create methods of prevention of periodontal diseases for the 11 - 15 year-old schoolchildren and present them too schoolchildren and dentists. ORIGINALITY OF INVESTIGATION OUTCOME For {{the first time in}} Lithuania the periodontal tissue condition of the eleven to fifteen years old town and village schoolchildren, the main periodontal disease risk factors, and the need for periodontal disease treatment was studied and evaluated, as well as the dental caries and periodontal disease risk factor relationship was identified. The periodontal disease prognosis algorithm, which was based on risk factor evaluation, was concluded. An inquiry, which was based on international protocol, was performed together with the public health specialists. Oral hygiene habits, complaints of gum bleeding, oral hygiene means of the Lithuanian schoolchildren as well as gum bleeding relationship to general health condition and schoolchildren way of life or other health-related habits were evaluated with the help of this inquiry. The relationship between the complaints of gum bleeding and the health-risk behaviour signs of the adolescents (smoking, alcohol and drug usage) was analysed. PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE OF THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY The data of the study reveal a large periodontal disease prevalence and severity among the eleven to fifteen years old schoolchildren, and substantiate the need for preventive measures implementation into functional health care. This problem is especially relevant now, at the time of health care system reform. The data of the oral hygiene inquiry present a substantial schoolchildren approach to tooth brushing, oral hygiene means, and vividly reveal the lack of oral hygiene education, especially among village schoolchildren. Because of that, with the reference to the data of the study, and with an aim to reduce periodontal disease development possibility, as well as to slow the progression of the existing diseases, {{it is very important to}} organise and introduce preventive programmes not only in a field of dental caries, but and the field of periodontal diseases as well. MATERIAL AND METHODS Periods of the study Period 1 comprises of the eleven to fifteen years old Lithuanian schoolchildren inquiry in order to evaluate oral hygiene means variety and the frequency of its application, as well as the frequency of schoolchildren complaints of gum bleeding. The research was carried out in 2002. Period 2 comprises of a more complex investigation. Kaunas and Kaunas region fifteen years old schoolchildren oral cavity hard and soft tissue condition was investigated, periodontal disease risk factors and periodontal disease treatment needs were studied. Lithuanian schoolchildren inquiry about tooth brushing frequency and additional usage of oral hygiene means was performed. The research was carried out in 2003 and 2004. Period 1 inquired children involved 2. 887 (51. 1 percent) boys and 2, 758 (48. 9 percent) girls. The schoolchildren age groups were of almost equal size: 1. 867 (33. 1 percent) eleven year-olds, 1. 873 (33. 2 percent) thirteen year-olds, 1. 905 (33. 7 percent) fifteen year-olds. Inquired children were divided into two groups according to their place of living: group 1 consisted of 2. 402 (42. 6 percent) of schoolchildren living in towns or regional centres; group 2 consisted of 3. 243 (57. 4 percent) of schoolchildren living in a small town or a village. Group 1 was conditionally called “town residents”, and group 2 was conditionally called “village residents”. During period 2 Kaunas, Kaunas region, Jurbarkas region, and Prienai region fifteen years old schoolchildren were properly examined and inquired. Table 1 shows the distribution of the inquired children according to living place and sex. Table 1. The epidemiological study inquiry children distribution according to living place and sex.

The research protocol for the study complies with the strict ethical standards that the WHO requires of its collaborative research. The surveys of schoolchildren are also being carried out according to the ethical procedures required by each individual participating country or region. Presentation of this paper agrees with the rules of Terms of Reference developed for the HBSC study. In this survey child's oral hygiene habits and complains of gum bleeding were accessed by four questions: 1) How often do you <b>brush</b> <b>your</b> <b>teeth?</b> (twice a day; once a day; at least once a week but not daily; less than once a week; never), 2) How often do you use dental floss? (almost daily; sometimes; never), 3) How often do you rinse your mouth with special rinses? (almost daily; sometimes; never), 4) Does your gum bleed than you brussh teeth? (yes; no). Assessment of oral health status among 11 - 15 year-olds Dental caries was scored by surface on all erupted teeth in accordance with the WHO criteria (WHO, 1978) : 0 – Sound; 1 – Decayed; 2 – Filled with decay; 3 – Filled, no decay; 4 – Missing, as a result of caries; 5 – Missing, any other reason; 6 – sealant, varnish; 7 – bridge abudment or special crown; 8 - Unerupted tooth; 9 – Excluded tooth. according to criteria of WHO. The results were recorded in a form, prepared according to the WHO recommendations. Periodontal status was recorded according to CPITN index (Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs), according to WHO (WHO, 1978). CPI-codes and Treatment Needs are described in table 2. Table 2. CPI-codes and Treatment Needs Code	Description of the Condition (CPI) 	TN	Treatment packages 0 	Healthy 1 	Bleeding on probing 	I	Oral hygiene instructions 2 	Supragingival and/or subgingival calculus. Iatrogenic marginal irritation	II	Oral hygiene instructions, scaling 3 	Pockets up to 4 - 5 mm. 		 4 	Deeper pockets from 6 mm. 	III	Oral hygiene instructions, scaling and root planing, complex treatment Oral hygiene was evaluation by OHI-S index (Green-Vermillion simplified). The OHI-S index consists of 2 components: plaque index (DI) and calculus index (CI) 		OHI-S = DI + CI There were examined vestibular surfaces of 16; 11; 26 and 31 teeth and lingual surfaces of 36 and 46 teeth. In there is no first molar, second molar was examined, if there was no central incisor, contralateral central incisor was examined. 	The criteria of plaque index (DI) : 	 0 – no plaque present. 	 1 – soft plaque covering not more than ⅓ of tooth surface. 	 2 – soft plaque covering more than ⅓, but not more than ⅔ of the tooth surface. 	 3 – soft plaque covering more than ⅔ of the tooth surface. 	The criteria of calculus index (CI) : 	 0 – no calculus present. 	 1 – supragingival calculus covering not more than ⅓ of the tooth surface. 2 – supragingival calculus cover more than ⅓, but less than ⅔ of the tooth surface, and some subgingival calculus. 3 – supragingival calculus cover more than ⅔ of the tooth surface and subgingival calculus present. 	The sum of scores is divided into 6 (the number of examined teeth). Table 3. Evaluation of the oral hygiene according to OHI-S index OHI-S	Oral hygiene 0 	Perfect 0. 1 – 1. 0 	Good 1. 1 – 2. 0 	Satisfactory 2. 1 – 6. 0 	Bad Data analysis Statistical data analysis was performed using the SPSS (Statistical Program for Social Science). The analyzed groups were described using the characterization of general statistics, dispersion and symmetrical association. The verification of the hypotheses of the relations between qualitative variables was performed using χ 2 criterion. The comparison of quantitative values was performed using Student’s t or Fisher’s F criterion. The mean of the descriptive statistical sample and average square deviation were calculated. These criteria were used for the verification of hypotheses on the means of two or more groups. In case of comparison of the mean values of two or more groups, the conclusions of t and F criteria coincide. The analyzed features of the each group should have normal distribution and the same dispersion when these criteria are used. Using the Kolmogorov–Smirnoff test, we estimated the normal distribution of quantitative values. For the comparison of the quantitative data without normal distribution, the tests of the comparison of non-parametric values were applied. The Mann–Whitney („U”) test was performed for the estimation of the difference between two independent groups, while the Cruscall–Wal („H”) test was performed for the estimation of the difference between several different groups. Pearson’s correlation coefficient r and Spearmen’s rank correlation coefficient R were used for the analysis of the correlation relationships between the criteria of the sample. Also, for the reduction of the number of the analyzed criteria and the clarification of general regularities we used factorial analysis. RESULTS AN...|$|E

So Halloween of the 21st century is not the All Hallows' Eve of the Middle Ages, and even gives rise to its own set of urban legends independent of the historical celebration. The cleansing rituals of Orthodox Judaism were originally good public health in a land with little water; now these customs signify identification as an Orthodox Jew. Compare this to <b>brushing</b> <b>your</b> <b>teeth,</b> also transmitted within a group, which remains a practical hygiene and health issue and does not {{rise to the level of}} a group-defining tradition. For tradition is initially remembered behavior. Once it loses its practical purpose, there is no reason for further transmission unless it has been imbued with meaning beyond the initial practicality of the action. This meaning is at the core of folkloristics, the study of folklore.|$|R
50|$|Since its creation, {{the uses}} of {{inoculation}} theory have been expanded {{in the areas of}} health, political, educational and commercial messaging. When McGuire (1966a) created this theory, it was applied to social clichés. This meant it was primarily used toward the attitudes that were rarely, if ever attacked by opposing forces. The early tests of inoculation theory were used on non-controversial issues, (e.g. <b>brushing</b> <b>your</b> <b>teeth</b> is good for you). Barely anybody would believe otherwise, so outside opposing arguments against tooth brushing would never actually change a person’s opinion, but it would strengthen a person’s support for brushing their teeth (Banas & Rains, 2010). Now inoculation theory studies target less popular or common attitudes, like whether a person should buy a Mac or a PC computer or should people support gay marriage. Implementing inoculation theory in studies of contemporary social issues (from mundane to controversial social issues), the variety and resurgence of studies using inoculation theory bolsters the effectiveness and utility of the theory and provides support that {{it can be used to}} strengthen and/or predict attitudes.|$|R
