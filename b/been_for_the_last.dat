25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} the lorica segmentata being worn is around 9 BC (Dangstetten), and the armour was evidently quite common in service until the 2nd century AD, judging {{from the number of}} finds throughout this period (over 100 sites are known, many of them in Britain). However, even during the 2nd century AD, the segmentata never replaced the lorica hamata - thus the hamata mail was still standard issue for both heavy infantry and auxiliaries alike. Roman soldiers, however, bought their own gear. The last recorded use of this armour seems to have <b>been</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> quarter of the 3rd century AD (Leon, Spain).|$|E
25|$|On 4 June, three {{additional}} inbound airline passengers {{were reported to}} be carrying the virus. The earliest of the three is a 23-year-old male student who returned from United States on 1 June via the same Malaysian Airlines flight (MH091) that the first cases of A (H1N1) were detected. On the same day, two German tourists and friends (aged 30 and 32) who were holidaying in Southeast Asia and arrived in Malaysia were confirmed to be infected with the virus; both had flown into the country on 3 June via an Air Asia flight (AK702) after transferring from a Singapore Airlines flight (SQ45) from Germany to Singapore on 1 June. The third reported victim developed symptoms on 3 June and was warded in Tunku Jaafar Hospital, while the two tourists developed symptoms while in Kuala Lumpur on 3 June and were given similar medical treatment. All three victims were reported to be stable. As it has <b>been</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> two cases, passengers sharing both the Malaysian Airlines and Air Asia flights are being traced.

On the next day, a girl from Australia was confirmed to be infected with Influenza A (H1N1) when the airport scanner detected severe fever making her the 7th confirmed case overall in Malaysia.|$|E

500|$|Neutral Milk Hotel {{formed in}} 1989 as an {{offshoot}} of Milk, a high school musical project of singer-songwriter Jeff Mangum, and the band was largely a Mangum solo project in the group's earlier days. The group {{was a part of}} The Elephant 6 Recording Company, a collective of musicians that includes, among others, notable indie rock bands The Apples in Stereo, The Olivia Tremor Control, and Of Montreal. The 1993 single [...] "Everything Is" [...] was the band's first release, and it would later be reissued as an EP with additional tracks. The band's first studio album, On Avery Island, was released on the independent label Merge, and has sold a relatively high 5,000 copies. Afterwards, the band began to tour for the first time, and grew to include horns player Scott Spillane, multi-instrumentalist Julian Koster, and drummer Jeremy Barnes. In 1998 the band released In the Aeroplane over the Sea on Merge, an album which has since {{become one of the most}} popular and acclaimed indie rock albums of the 1990s. Up until 2011's Ferris Wheel on Fire EP, the band had had no new releases since In the Aeroplane over the Sea, though Mangum has said [...] "I don't know what's going to happen, but I certainly want to make music a bigger part of my life in the future than it has <b>been</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> couple of years." ...|$|E

[...] Jose Baez said, [...] "While we're happy for Casey, there are no winners in this case. Caylee has passed on far, far too soon, and what my driving force has <b>been</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> three years has been always {{to make sure that there}} has been justice for Caylee and Casey because Casey did not murder Caylee.

[...] Former Casey Anthony defense attorney Linda Kenney Baden shared Baez's sentiments. She believes the jury reached the right verdict. [...] "We should embrace their verdict," [...] she stated.|$|E
2500|$|Despite Graham's {{announcement}} that the Fillmore West gig was Big Brother's last concert with Joplin, the band—with Joplin still as lead vocalist—toured the United States that fall. Reflecting Joplin's crossover appeal, two October 1968 performances at a roller rink in Alexandria, Virginia, were reviewed by John Segraves {{of the conservative}} Washington Evening Star {{at a time when}} the Washington metropolitan area's hard rock scene was in its infancy. An opera buff at the time, he wrote, [...] "Miss Joplin, in her early 20s, has <b>been</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> year or two the vocalist with Big Brother and the Holding Company, a rock quintet of superior electric expertise. Shortly she will be merely Janis Joplin, a vocalist singing folk rock on her first album as a single. Whatever she does and whatever she sings she'll do it well because her vocal talents are boundless. This is the way she came across in a huge, high-ceilinged roller skating rink without any acoustics but, thankfully a good enough sound system behind her. In a proper room, I would imagine there would be no adjectives to describe her." ...|$|E

According to at least one source (Deborah Scroggins), Siddiqui [...] "avoided the {{question}} of where she had <b>been</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> five years" [...] and her replies under cross examination [...] may have damaged her credibility in jurists' eyes. In answer to prosecutor's questions she stated that [...] the documents in her bag on terror plans and weapons had been given to her, and that she did not know that the boy who was with her in Ghazni was her son. When it was pointed out that the document in her bag were in her own handwriting, she stated [...] "in a vague and halting manner" [...] that she had been forced to copy them out of a magazine so that her children would not be tortured. When questioned about taking a firearms course she stated that [...] "everyone used to take it". The pistol safety instructor then testified that he remembered teaching her how to fire [...] "hundreds of rounds." [...] In his closing arguments the prosecutor told the jury that Siddiqui had [...] "raised her right hand" [...] and [...] "lied to your face".|$|E
