25|$|The dry compass used in China was a dry {{suspension}} compass, {{a wooden}} frame crafted {{in the shape}} of a turtle hung upside down by a board, with the lodestone sealed in by wax, and if rotated, the needle at the tail would always point in the northern cardinal direction. Although the 14th-century European compass-card in <b>box</b> <b>frame</b> and dry pivot needle was adopted in China after its use was taken by Japanese pirates in the 16th century (who had in turn learned of it from Europeans), the Chinese design of the suspended dry compass persisted in use well into the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|In October 1942, Manuel Richard Hornibrook was {{commissioned}} by the US Army to erect four large stores at Eagle Farm, most likely hangars 4,5,6 and 7 of an igloo design. The igloo {{is a form of}} light nailed timber arch construction. These hangars were built fronting the straight six section, as a ready made apron, with hangar 7 built for the Allied Technical Air Intelligence Unit (ATAIU) located separately {{at the end of the}} straight. These hangars were based on the US Army 104ft span timber <b>box</b> <b>frame</b> design and were clad with galvanised iron, but when that material was restricted, terne-coated iron was used, a lead-tin coating usually used for fuel tank manufacture. There were various igloo designs, but the AWC designs were considered to be far more rugged than US designs, and were designed to have a reasonably long life under winds of up to 65 miles per hour, and used standard grade Group C hardwood timber.|$|E

2500|$|A {{major change}} from its {{predecessor}} the C4, the C5 featured a hydroformed <b>box</b> <b>frame,</b> {{a design that}} offered an improved structural platform, especially for a convertible body style.
