He kept his colours apart from each other: his palette consisted of vermilion, white, naples yellow, two different yellow ochres, two red ochres, raw sienna, light red, <b>burnt</b> <b>sienna,</b> crimson lake, Prussian blue, peach black, ivory black, cassel earth and bitumen. Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but {{over a period of}} time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated. As a result of this, details in large areas of the work can hardly be discerned today.|$|E

25|$|Where the {{dialectic}} nature of Paul Cézanne's {{work had been}} influential between 1908 and 1910 during the expressionistic phase of Cubism, the flat, linear structures of Georges Seurat would capture {{the attention of the}} Cubists from 1911. In addition to the flattened depth of field, the colors (subtle blues, raw umber and <b>burnt</b> <b>sienna)</b> employed in La Femme au Cheval bear a resemblance to the colors of Seurat's 1889–90 Le Chahut and his 1887–88 Parade de Cirque.|$|E

5000|$|Marjorie Helen Arnfield, MBE (25 November 1930 - 26 April 2001) was an English {{artist who}} {{specialised}} in both industrial and rural landscapes, painting in oil, acrylic and watercolour. Her landscapes, particularly her paintings of Provence and Spain, {{are characterized by}} vivid colours and an impressionistic style. In an interview in the magazine Artists & Illustrators in 1998, Arnfield described her palette of colours, which included ochres, <b>burnt</b> <b>siennas,</b> cadmium, viridian, reds and blues, as [...] "colours that sing".|$|R
50|$|One of {{the first}} uses was as a pigment. The yellow form {{produced}} yellow ochre for which Cyprus was famous, while the darker forms produced more earthy tones. Roasting the limonite changed it partially to hematite, producing red ochres, <b>burnt</b> umbers and <b>siennas.</b>|$|R
25|$|Before the Industrial Revolution, many {{pigments}} {{were known}} by the location where they were produced. Pigments based on minerals and clays often bore {{the name of the}} city or region where they were mined. Raw Sienna and <b>Burnt</b> <b>Sienna</b> came from Siena, Italy, while Raw Umber and Burnt Umber came from Umbria. These pigments were among the easiest to synthesize, and chemists created modern colors based on the originals that were more consistent than colors mined from the original ore bodies. But the place names remained.|$|E
2500|$|The Practice of Water-Colour Painting {{describes}} his palette as [...] "cendre blue, French blue, oxide of chromium (opaque and transparent), Hooker's green, No. 1, yellow ochre, aureolin, cadmium orange, raw sienna, <b>burnt</b> <b>sienna,</b> purple madder, rose madder, light red, brown madder, Vandyke brown, raw umber, and flake white; and occasionally vermilion, burnt umber, and lampblack." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The School of Mines {{experimented with}} and {{developed}} many clays and glazes. [...] Clays used included Dickinson, Beulah, Hebron, Mandan, Weigel, Red and Grey Ross, McCurdy, Hettinger, and bentonite. [...] Much North Dakota pottery {{was made from}} a mix of Hettinger, Mandan, Red Ross, and Beulah clay. [...] Bentonite clays, which fired to a rich <b>burnt</b> <b>sienna</b> color, were used primarily for pottery with Indian motifs. [...] An advantage of bentonite was {{that it could have}} glazes applied to green ware and be finished in one firing." [...] ( [...] by Bob Barr) ...|$|E
60|$|Shall {{the names}} {{of so many of}} our colors {{continue}} to be derived from those of obscure foreign localities, as Naples yellow, Prussian blue, raw <b>Sienna,</b> <b>burnt</b> Umber, Gamboge?--(surely the Tyrian purple must have faded by this time),--or from comparatively trivial articles of commerce,-- chocolate, lemon, coffee, cinnamon, claret?--(shall we compare our Hickory to a lemon, or a lemon to a Hickory?)--or from ores and oxides which few ever see? Shall we so often, when describing to our neighbors the color of something we have seen, refer them, not to some natural object in our neighborhood, but perchance to a bit of earth fetched {{from the other side of}} the planet, which possibly they may find at the apothecary's, but which probably neither they nor we ever saw? Have we not an earth under our feet,--ay, and a sky over our heads? Or is the last all ultramarine? What do we know of sapphire, amethyst, emerald, ruby, amber, and the like,--most of us who take these names in vain? Leave these precious words to cabinet-keepers, virtuosos, and maids-of-honor,-- to the Nabobs, Begums, and Chobdars of Hindostan, or wherever else. I do not see why, since America and her autumn woods have been discovered, our leaves should not compete with the precious stones in giving names to colors; and, indeed, I believe that in course of time {{the names of}} some of our trees and shrubs, as well as flowers, will get into our popular chromatic nomenclature.|$|R

60|$|Need we {{say that}} Peter's warning word was not thrown away on Hester Sommers, who was seated in her corner {{embroidering}} with gold thread a pair of red morocco slippers. But, forewarned though she was, her presence of mind was put to a tremendous test when, all unexpectedly, George Foster descended the steps and stood before her. Fortunately, while the youth was bestowing a hearty nautical greeting on Mrs Lilly-- for his greeting was always hearty, as well to new acquaintances as to old friends--Hester had time to bend over her work and thus conceal the sudden pallor followed by an equally sudden flush which changed her complexion from a bluish grey to a <b>burnt</b> <b>sienna.</b> When George turned to glance carelessly at her she was totally absorbed in the slipper.|$|E
60|$|It is a {{long time}} since we met; and I fear these letters may never reach you. But in these violent times I {{remember}} with a curious vividness how you brandished a paintbrush about your easel when I was a boy; and how it thrilled me to think that you had so brandished a bayonet against the Teutons--I hope with the same precision and happy results. Round about that period, the very pigments seemed {{to have some sort of}} picturesque connection with your national story. There seemed to be something gorgeous and terrible about Venetian Red; and something quite catastrophic about <b>Burnt</b> <b>Sienna.</b> But somehow or other, when I saw in the street yesterday the colours on your flag, it reminded me of the colours on your palette.|$|E
60|$|Through {{the desert}} flows the river--a thread of blue silk drawn across an {{enormous}} brown drugget; and even this thread is brown {{for half the}} year. Where the water laps the sand and soaks into the banks there grows an avenue of vegetation which seems very beautiful and luxuriant by contrast with what lies beyond. The Nile, through all the three thousand miles of its course vital to everything that lives beside it, is never so precious as here. The traveller clings to the strong river as to an old friend, staunch in the hour of need. All the world blazes, but here is shade. The deserts are hot, but the Nile is cool. The land is parched, but here is abundant water. The picture painted in <b>burnt</b> <b>sienna</b> is relieved by a grateful flash of green.|$|E
6000|$|Honora {{cannot be}} unduly blamed. When {{she reached the}} [...] "little house under the hill" [...] (as Catherine called the chamber beneath the eaves), she beheld {{reflected}} in the mirror an image like a tall, white flower that might indeed have belonged to a princess. Her hair, the colour of <b>burnt</b> <b>sienna,</b> fell evenly to her shoulders; her features even then had regularity and hauteur; her legs, in their black silk stockings, were straight; and the simple white lawn frock made {{the best of a}} slender figure. Those frocks of Honora's were a continual source of wonder and sometimes of envy--to Aunt Mary's friends; who returned from the seaside in the autumn, after a week among the fashions in Boston or New York, to find Honora in the latest models, and better dressed than their own children. Aunt Mary made no secret of the methods by which these seeming miracles were performed, and showed Cousin Eleanor Hanbury the fashion plates in the English periodicals. Cousin Eleanor sighed.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Cann painted {{flowers and}} card-screens elegantly, and [...] "finished" [...] pencil-drawings most elaborately for her pupils. She could copy prints, {{so that at}} a little {{distance}} you would scarcely know that the copy in stumped chalk was not a bad mezzotinto engraving. She even had a little old paint-box, and showed you one or two ivory miniatures out of the drawer. She gave John James what little knowledge of drawing she had, and handed him over her invaluable recipes for mixing water-colours--"for trees in foregrounds, <b>burnt</b> <b>sienna</b> and indigo"--"for very dark foliage, ivory black and gamboge"--"for flesh-colour," [...] etc. etc. John James went through her poor little course, but not so brilliantly as she expected. She was forced to own that several of her pupils' [...] "pieces" [...] were executed much more dexterously than Johnny Ridley's. Honeyman looked at the boy's drawings from time to time, and said, [...] "Hm, ha!--very clever--a great deal of fancy, really." [...] But Honeyman knew no more of the subject than a deaf and dumb man knows of music. He could talk the art cant very glibly, and had a set of Morghens and Madonnas as became a clergyman and a man of taste; but he saw not with eyes such as those wherewith Heaven had endowed the humble little butler's boy, to whom splendours of Nature were revealed to vulgar sights invisible, and beauties manifest in forms, colours, shadows of common objects, {{where most of the}} world saw only what was dull, and gross, and familiar. One reads in the magic story-books of a charm or a flower which the wizard gives, and which enables the bearer to see the fairies. O enchanting boon of Nature, which reveals to the possessor the hidden spirits of beauty round about him! spirits which the strongest and most gifted masters compel into painting or song. To others it is granted but to have fleeting glimpses of that fair Art-world; and tempted by ambition, or barred by faint-heartedness, or driven by necessity, to turn away thence to the vulgar life-track, and the light of common day.|$|E
