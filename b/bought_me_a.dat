500|$|When Tankersley was four, {{her father}} died by suicide, {{believed}} to be partly attributed to his defeat for renomination in 1924. [...] Her mother remarried in 1932 to Albert Gallatin Simms, a congressman from New Mexico, lawyer, and banker. Tankersley spent part of her childhood on her mother's Rock River dairy farm in Byron, Illinois, and later moved to the Southwest {{with her mother and}} stepfather, living at a ranch owned by Simms in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at first, and then moving in 1937 to the Trinchera Ranch, a [...] property in Colorado that her mother had purchased. Tankersley attended a boarding school in Virginia and spent summers in the West. Her love of horses in general and the Arabian horse in particular came from those years: [...] "Right away, my stepfather <b>bought</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> cow pony, and I wore it out... So my mother got me a [...] Arabian that I couldn't wear out." [...] She also showed horses on the East Coast in the 1930s. Her interest in Arabian horses led her to meet several major breeders of the time, including Jimmie Dean of Traveler's Rest, Roger Selby, W.R. Brown and Carl Raswan.|$|E

In December, a psychiatric evaluation arranged by her probation officer recommended Spencer be admitted to a mental hospital for depression, but her father refused to give permission.

First, I'd record a beat on the drums, then, I'd play that tape into another tape recorder while playing keyboard; then I'd take that tape and play bass guitar along with the drums and keyboard.

5000|$|However, Mersha {{is still}} very much a {{forgotten}} hero. His biography remains unwritten and his distinguished service is poorly known by many scholars and students of Ethiopian history. In his book titled Pioneers of Change in Ethiopia: The reformist Intellectuals of the early twentieth century, Professor Bahru Zewde describes the contributions of many historic personalities of that dynamic era. The book does not mention Mersha as a pioneer. However, some of the reformist intellectuals discussed had either administered the offices he helped establish or occupied the positions he held before. Neggadras Gebrehiwot Baykedagn (c.1885-1918), arguably the foremost intellectual of the time, for example, was director of the Dire Dawa customs administration.Fitawrari Tekle Hawariat Tekle-Mariam (1884-1977), who later became governor of Jigjiga; credited for founding Asebe Teferi; and is best known for playing a prominent role in the drafting of the 1931 constitution, was chief of the railway station briefly during Lij Iyasu. He was also among the first Ethiopians to travel abroad for education. As a matter of fact, shortly before the young Tekle Hawaryat departed for Russia, in 1896, Mersha gave him his blessings. We find the following interesting account in his autobiography,:"ጄልዴሳ ላይ ስንደርስ አቶ መርሻ ናሁ ሰናይ ከቤታቸው ወስደው ጋበዙኝ። ያስቀሩኛል ብዬ ፈርቼ በቶሎ ወጣሁና ወደ ሰፈሬ ሮጥኩ። ፀሀይ እንዳይጎዳኝ አስበው አቶ መርሻ ጥላ ገዝተው ሰጡኝ። (ከወንድሜ ከሟቹ ገብረ ጻድቅ ጋር በጣም ይፋቀሩ ነበር።)" [...] (p. 78) English translation: When we arrived at Jaldessa, Ato Mersha invited me for lunch at his residence. Because I was afraid that he might not let me travel overseas, I ran away as soon as I finished. Ato Mersha, however, <b>bought</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> umbrella so I could protect myself from the scorching sun. (He and my deceased brother Gebre Tsadiq were dear friends)." ...|$|R
