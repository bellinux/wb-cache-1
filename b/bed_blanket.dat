60|$|During breakfast {{our spirits}} came up a little, since we found by this guide-book {{that in the}} hotels on the summit the tourist is not left to trust to luck for his sunrise, but is roused betimes {{by a man who}} goes through the halls with a great Alpine horn, blowing blasts that would raise the dead. And there was another consoling thing: the guide-book said that up there on the summit the guests did not wait to dress much, but seized a red <b>bed</b> <b>blanket</b> and sailed out arrayed like an Indian. This was good; this would be romantic; two hundred and fifty people grouped on the windy summit, with their hair flying and their red {{blankets}} flapping, in the solemn presence of the coming sun, would be a striking and memorable spectacle. So it was good luck, not ill luck, that we had missed those other sunrises.|$|E
60|$|The {{steerage}} was {{now as a}} bedlam; {{trunks and}} chests were locked and tied round with ropes; and a general washing and rinsing of faces and hands was beheld. While this was going on, forth came an order from the quarter-deck, for every <b>bed,</b> <b>blanket,</b> bolster, and bundle of straw in the steerage {{to be committed to}} the deep.--A command that was received by the emigrants with dismay, and then with wrath. But they were assured, that this was indispensable to the getting rid of an otherwise long detention of some weeks at the quarantine. They therefore reluctantly complied; and overboard went pallet and pillow. Following them, went old pots and pans, bottles and baskets. So, all around, the sea was strewn with stuffed bed-ticks, that limberly floated on the waves--couches for all mermaids who were not fastidious. Numberless things of this sort, tossed overboard from emigrant ships nearing the harbor of New York, drift in through the Narrows, and are deposited on the shores of Staten Island; along whose eastern beach I have often walked, and speculated upon the broken jugs, torn pillows, and dilapidated baskets at my feet.|$|E

40|$|The thermal {{properties}} of the lithium ceramics pebble beds {{have a significant impact}} on the temperature profile of the Helium Cooled Pebble <b>Bed</b> <b>blanket</b> and the extraction of heat from the pebble beds to the coolant. The literature review showed a lack of experimental data on the interface thermal conductance (h) of lithium metatitanate pebble beds, therefore the objective of this study is to present experimental values of h. The measuring technique is based on the principles of steady state and axial heat flow methods. The lithium metatitanate pebble bed is single size (Ø 1. 7 - 2. 0 mm pebbles) with a packing fraction of 61 %. The values of h were measured at the interface of the pebbles with their container’s wall (made of stainless steel 316). The results showed that h increased from 1800 to 5300 W/m 2. K with the increase of the wall temperature from 24 to 570 qC. The theoretical values of h, calculated by three models, were compared with the experimental values. The theoretical and experimental values of h showed similar behavior with the increase of temperature.

40|$|The aims of {{the study}} were to {{determine}} the sites in a pediatric burns unit that were contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus. Samples from the environment in bedrooms and the common room were taken monthly for 6 months using blood agar for total counts and Baird-Parker agar for S. aureus. The air was sampled using an air-sampling device and settle plates. Hard and soft surfaces including <b>bed,</b> <b>blanket,</b> sofa, chair, taps, bathtub, soft toys, locker and cupboard in the same rooms were sampled using contact plates. Swabs were taken from staff monthly for 3 months. S. aureus isolates were tested for production of enterotoxins A-D and toxic shock syndrome toxin- 1 using a reverse passive latex agglutination test. The results showed that S. aureus was recovered more frequently using settle plates than using the air sampler. All surfaces sampled were contaminated with S. aureus and contamination was greatest in frequently occupied rooms. A variety of toxin producing isolates were found with enterotoxin C isolates, either alone or in combination with TSST- 1 (toxic shock syndrome toxin- 1) dominant. The staff were transiently colonised with S. aureus strains with a different toxin production pattern. The results show that airborne transmission may be a route for infection by S. aureus and is responsible for contaminating the environment. Â© 2007...|$|E

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{is commonly}} used in industrial waste water treatment applications {{and it is a}} combination of many biochemical and physicochemical processes. Modeling and simulation of an anaerobic digestion is very vital to identify the behavior of industrial waste water treatment plant to optimize its operations. In this research, anaerobic digestion model called ADM 1 (Anaerobic digestion model no 1) developed by IWA task group is applied to model and simulate UASB reactors. ADM 1 model comprises with dynamic state variables which represent all biological and physic chemical reactions. This model was built in simulator called Aquasim 2. 1 f (Reichert, 1998). To model UASB reactors, simplified model is proposed based on different research compartments. UASB modeled by simulator taking as three CSTR compartments named sludge <b>bed,</b> <b>blanket</b> and settler. Influent for experimented waste water plant is waste water generated from dairy plant. Experiments were conducted at waste water treatment plant (WWTP) under three volumetric flow rates 10 m 3 /d, 15 m 3 /d and 25 m 3 /d. plant is actually operates at 25 m 3 /d. Three parameters such as cumulative gas volume, pH and COD were measured. At the same volumetric flow rate WWTP was simulated with the new model and parameters such as VFA, gas composition,inhibition and biomass growth rates were obtained. By varying recycle ratio from bed to blanket and settler to blanket, appropriate recycle ratio is replaced to get best fitted model. (bed to blanket- 0. 8 and settler to blanket 0. 6). Optimization was performed under two scenarios. ie by varying volumetric flow rates and input COD level. it was found that above 30 m 3 /d UASB become unstable producing 21 % of CH 4 and 75 % of CO 2. Also it can be found that 7500 mgCOD/l can be treated at the volumetric rate of 30 m 3 /d without any instabilit...|$|E
40|$|The most {{prevalent}} criticism of fission-fusion hybrids {{is simply that}} they are too exotic - that they would exacerbate the challenges of both fission and fusion. This is not really true. Intriguingly, hybrids could actually be more viable than stand-alone fusion reactors while mitigating many challenges of fission. This work develops a conceptual design for a fission-fusion hybrid reactor in steady-state L-mode tokamak configuration with a subcritical natural or depleted uranium pebble <b>bed</b> <b>blanket.</b> A liquid lithiumlead alloy breeds enough tritium to replenish that consumed by the D-T fusion reaction. Subcritical operation could obviate the most challenging fuel cycle aspects of fission. The fission blanket augments the fusion power such that the fusion core itself need not have a high power gain, thus allowing for fully non-inductive (steady-state) low confinement mode (L-mode) operation at relatively small physical dimensions. A neutron transport Monte Carlo code models the natural uranium fission blanket. Maximizing the fission power while breeding sufficient tritium allows for the selection of an optimal set of blanket parameters, which yields a maximum prudent fission power gain of 7. 7. A 0 -D tokamak model suffices to analyze approximate tokamak operating conditions. If {{the definition of a}} "reactor" is a device with a total power gain of 40, then this fission blanket would allow the fusion component of a hybrid reactor with the same dimensions as ITER to operate in steady-state L-mode very comfortably with a fusion power gain of 6. 7 and a thermal fusion power of 2. 1 GW. Taking this further can determine the approximate minimum scale for a steady-state L-mode tokamak hybrid reactor, which is a major radius of 5. 2 in and an aspect ratio of 2. 8. This minimum scale device operates barely within the steady-state L-mode realm with a thermal fusion power of 1. 7 GW. This hybrid, with its very fast neutron spectrum, could be superior to pure fission reactors in terms of breeding fissile fuel and transmuting deleterious fission products. It could operate either as a breeder, producing fuel for pure fission reactors from natural or depleted uranium, or as a deep burner, fissioning heavy metal and transmuting waste with a cycle time of decades. Despite a plethora of potential functions, its primary mission is deemed to be that of a deep burner producing baseload commercial power with a once-through fuel cycle. Although hybrids are often purported a priori to pose an elevated proliferation risk, this reactor breeds plutonium that could actually be more proliferation-resistant than that bred by fast reactors. Furthermore, a novel method (the "variable fixed source method") can maintain constant total hybrid power output as burnup proceeds by varying the neutron source strength. As for engineering feasibility, basic thermal hydraulic analysis demonstrates that pressurized helium could cool the pebble bed fission blanket with a flow rate below 10 m/s. The Brayton cycle thermal efficiency is 41 %. This device is dubbed the Steady-State L-Mode Non-Enriched Uranium Tokamak Hybrid (SLEUTH). The purpose of this work is not any sort of elaborate design, but rather the exploration of an idea coupled with corroborating numerical analysis. At this point in the hybrid debate, viable conceptual designs are persuasive while intricate build-ready designs are superfluous. This work conceives such a conceptual design, demonstrates its viability, and will perhaps, incidentally, spur a profusion of pro-fusion sentiment!by Mark Wilbert Reed. Thesis (S. M.)
