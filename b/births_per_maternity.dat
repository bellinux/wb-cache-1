50|$|The {{fertility}} rate in India {{has been in}} long-term decline, and more than halved from 1960-2009. From 5.7 <b>births</b> <b>per</b> woman in 1966, it declined to 3.3 <b>births</b> <b>per</b> woman by 1997 and 2.7 <b>births</b> <b>per</b> woman in 2009.

40|$|International audienceAIMS OF THE STUDY: To {{describe}} {{the management of}} extremely preterm newborns {{at the threshold of}} viability before 24 weeks of gestation in the delivery room when the decision has been made not to provide intensive care; to assess the role of palliative care (PC); to report the problems encountered. METHOD: A prospective qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews from November 2009 to June 2010 in two level III French maternity hospitals (A and B). In each center, four midwives, two obstetricians, two pediatricians, two anesthetists, and one chief midwife were interviewed. RESULTS: In maternity hospital A, a protocol was in place that proposed PC derived from developmental care (noise limitation, drying, warming) provided by parents or staff. The problems reported were related to former euthanasia practices rather than new procedures. In maternity hospital B, no palliative care protocol had been set up. Euthanasia was practiced and accepted fatalistically because the only currently existing alternative (letting the infant die) was considered inhumane. Few problems were reported. The reluctance to carry out PC is conceptual and organizational (the ratio of <b>births</b> <b>per</b> midwife in <b>maternity</b> hospital B was twice that of maternity hospital A). Lexical analysis showed preferential use of the words "fetus" and "expulsion" versus "child" and "delivery" in maternity hospital B (p< 0. 05) when speaking of the delivery of the extremely preterm infant. Our explanatory hypothesis is that the concept of "fetus ex utero" legitimates euthanasia by assimilating it to feticide. CONCLUSION: At the time of this study, two very different approaches to the death of extremely preterm, non-resuscitated newborns in the delivery room coexisted in France. Palliative care is obviously possible, after group reflection, if a true motivation to change, {{a better understanding of the}} law, and a clear identification of the respective status of the fetus and the newborn exist in the maternity hospital...|$|R
40|$|Remarkable {{success has}} been {{achieved}} during {{the last half of}} the twentieth century in the reduction of fertility in the Asian and Pacific region. According to the 2002 ESCAP Population Data Sheet, the total fertility rate in the region has dropped to 2. 4 <b>births</b> <b>per</b> woman from around 6 in 1950. This regional average, however, masks a considerable difference in the total fertility rate (TFR) observed among subregions. The TFR has plummeted to below the replacement level (2. 1 <b>births</b> <b>per</b> woman) in East and North-East Asia (1. 6 <b>births</b> <b>per</b> woman) and North and Central Asia (1. 5 <b>births</b> <b>per</b> woman). In sharp contrast, South and South-West Asia exhibit a TFR of 3. 3 <b>births</b> <b>per</b> woman. The South-East Asian and the Pacific subregions have fertility rates of 2. 5 and 2. 4 <b>births</b> <b>per</b> woman respectively (ESCAP, 2002). Within subregions, TFRs vary to a large extent by country. Fertility has dropped to below the replacement level in all the populations of East and North-East Asia, except for Mongolia where the TFR is 2. 3 <b>births</b> <b>per</b> woman. Below replacement fertility has been reached in Singapore and Thailand in South-East Asia, while Sri Lanka is the only country in South and South-West Asia exhibiting below replacement fertility...|$|R
