5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the recipient, {{the fate of}} her sons, and the authorship of the letter. Bixby's character has <b>been</b> <b>questioned</b> (including rumored Confederate sympathies), {{at least two of}} her sons survived the war, and the letter was possibly written by Lincoln's assistant private secretary, John Hay.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{has been}} mixed, but generally negative. Contemporary historians, such as Charles B. MacDonald, praised the work– although some did comment on its length. Modern reviewers have identified inconsistencies or {{errors in the}} material, based on later declassified records. Also, some of Brown's personal conclusions have <b>been</b> <b>questioned.</b>|$|E

5|$|P. p. centralis, {{described}} by Erwin Stresemann in 1928 under its current name, breeds in Central Asia. It is smaller and less strongly blue than P. p. himalayanus, but its distinctness {{from the next}} subspecies has <b>been</b> <b>questioned.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scholia – {{commentary}} on the earlier writings of Pseudo-Dionysius. The original edition in Latin of Balthasar Corderius (Antwerp 1634) attributes all of the Scholia to Maximus, but the authorship has <b>been</b> <b>questioned</b> with Hans Urs von Balthasar (1940, 1961) attributing some of the Scholia to John of Scythopolis.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} was significant, because it represented the first ceratopsid known from China, {{and possibly the}} only ceratopsid from Asia. The only other possible Asian ceratopsid is Turanoceratops, but recently, its identification as a ceratopsid has <b>been</b> <b>questioned.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1979, Morris <b>was</b> <b>questioned</b> {{about the}} Yorkshire Ripper case. Joy Division's touring {{schedule}} {{happened to be}} similar to Peter Sutcliffe's movements which led to the police's suspicion. Following gigs in Halifax, Huddersfield, Leeds and Manchester, both Morris and bass player Peter Hook <b>were</b> <b>questioned.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1979, Hook <b>was</b> <b>questioned</b> as {{a suspect}} in the Yorkshire Ripper case. Joy Division's touring {{schedule}} coincided with Peter Sutcliffe's movements which led to the police's suspicion.

5|$|After King Henry's {{death in}} 1135, Basset was not {{employed}} as a royal official, either as a justice or as a sheriff. He appears once as a witness to a charter of King Stephen's in 1136, but the authenticity of this document has <b>been</b> <b>questioned.</b> He had built a castle in Normandy at Montreuil-au-Houlme, but Basset did not have possession of it in 1136, when it was held against Stephen's opponents by William de Montpincon.|$|E
5|$|As stated above, the hydrolytic {{proteins}} Rrp6 and Rrp44 {{are associated}} with the exosome in yeast and in humans, besides Rrp6, two different proteins, Dis3 and Dis3L1 can be associated at the position of the yeast Rrp44 protein. Although originally the S1 domain proteins were thought to have 3'-5' hydrolytic exoribonuclease activity as well, the existence of this activity has recently <b>been</b> <b>questioned</b> and these proteins might have just a role in binding substrates prior to their degradation by the complex.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the Greeks of Laconia and Arcadia, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of a certain Michael, tried to stop the Franks at the olive grove of Kountouras in northeastern Messenia. Modern scholars have traditionally identified this Michael with Michael I Komnenos Doukas, founder of the Despotate of Epirus, but this identification has <b>been</b> <b>questioned</b> more recently by Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, as the fragile nature of his control over Epirus would have made a departure to aid the Moreote Greeks a major and unlikely gamble.|$|E

5|$|Boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and {{tellurium}} are recognised commonly as metalloids. Depending on the author, one or {{more from}} selenium, polonium, or astatine are sometimes added to the list. Boron sometimes is excluded, by itself, or with silicon. Sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid. The inclusion of antimony, polonium, and astatine as metalloids also has <b>been</b> <b>questioned.</b>|$|E
5|$|Current eagle feather law {{stipulates}} that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry {{enrolled in a}} federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain or possess bald or golden eagle feathers for religious or spiritual use. The constitutionality of these laws has <b>been</b> <b>questioned</b> by Native American groups {{on the basis that}} it violates the First Amendment by affecting ability to practice their religion freely.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, its {{identification}} as a Roman road has <b>been</b> <b>questioned</b> by academics, and alternative interpretations suggested for its purpose and date of construction. The monument's co-manager, English Heritage, in 2012 proposed several avenues of research that {{might be used to}} settle some of the questions that have arisen regarding its origins and usage.|$|E

5|$|In {{the outer}} Solar System, comets remain frozen and {{inactive}} and are extremely {{difficult or impossible}} to detect from Earth due to their small size. Statistical detections of inactive comet nuclei in the Kuiper belt have been reported from observations by the Hubble Space Telescope but these detections have <b>been</b> <b>questioned.</b> As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them.|$|E
5|$|Ladislaus {{intervened in}} a {{conflict}} between Wladislaw I Herman, Duke of Poland, and the duke's illegitimate son, Zbigniew, on the latter's behalf. He marched to Poland and captured Wladislaw I Herman's younger son, Boleslav, in 1093. At Ladislaus's demand, Wladislaw I Herman declared Zbigniew his legitimate son. The Illuminated Chronicle also mentions that the Hungarian troops captured Cracow during Ladislaus's campaign, but the credibility of this report has <b>been</b> <b>questioned.</b>|$|E
5|$|Millepora alcicornis {{is not a}} true coral {{in class}} Anthozoa but is in class Hydrozoa, and is {{more closely related to}} {{jellyfish}} than stony corals. Because of the variability in growth habit that this coral exhibits, it {{has been the subject of}} much confusion as to its taxonomy, being described under a number of different names from different localities. In 1898, Hickson decided that the variations in morphology were due to environmental factors and that Millepora alcicornis was the valid name for all these species. This conclusion has since <b>been</b> <b>questioned.</b>|$|E

5|$|One of {{the reasons}} the account's {{authenticity}} has <b>been</b> <b>questioned</b> {{is the fact that it}} claims St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law. Offler doubted that canon law had penetrated to England to any great degree in 1088. The historian Mark Philpott, however, argues that St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law, since he owned a copy of one of the basis of canon law, the False Decretals. The bishop's manuscript of the Decretals still survives.|$|E
5|$|Police {{also found}} that the cell phone of a former Ocean Club {{restaurant}} worker had been used near the resort that night. Originally from Cape Verde, West Africa, Euclides Monteiro died in 2009 in a tractor accident after being fired from the Ocean Club in 2006 for theft. The suspicion was that he had been breaking into apartments to finance a drug habit. His widow said he had <b>been</b> <b>questioned</b> previously about break-ins involving the sexual assault of children, but had been cleared by DNA evidence.|$|E
