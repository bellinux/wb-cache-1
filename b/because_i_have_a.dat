500|$|In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought another music {{publishing}} company, Famous Music LLC, formerly owned by Viacom. This deal {{gave him the}} rights to songs by Eminem and Beck, among others. In March 2007, Jackson gave a brief interview to the Associated Press in Tokyo, where he said: [...] "I've been {{in the entertainment industry}} since I was 6 years old, and as Charles Dickens would say, 'It's been the best of times, the worst of times.' But I would not change my career ... While some have made deliberate attempts to hurt me, I take it in stride <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> loving family, a strong faith and wonderful friends and fans who have, and continue, to support me." [...] That month, Jackson visited a U.S. Army post in Japan, Camp Zama, to greet over 3,000 U.S. troops and their families. The hosts presented Jackson with a Certificate of Appreciation.|$|E
500|$|In September 2005, {{the paper}} decided to begin subscription-based service for daily columns {{in a program}} known as TimesSelect, which {{encompassed}} many previously free columns. Until being discontinued two years later, TimesSelect cost $7.95 per month or $49.95 per year, though it was free for print copy subscribers and university students and faculty. To avoid this charge, bloggers often reposted TimesSelect material, {{and at least one}} site once compiled links of reprinted material. On September 17, 2007, The New York Times announced that it would stop charging for access to parts of its Web site, effective at midnight the following day, reflecting a growing view in the industry that subscription fees cannot outweigh the potential ad revenue from increased traffic on a free site. In addition to opening almost the entire site to all readers, The New York Times news archives from 1987 to the present are available at no charge, as well as those from 1851 to 1922, which are in the public domain. Access to the Premium Crosswords section continues to require either home delivery or a subscription for $6.95 per month or $39.95 per year. Times columnists including Nicholas Kristof and Thomas Friedman had criticized TimesSelect, with Friedman {{going so far as to}} say [...] "I hate it. It pains me enormously because it's cut me off from a lot, a lot of people, especially <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of people reading me overseas, like in India ... I feel totally cut off from my audience." ...|$|E

500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of people and I enjoy that. Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Douglas Yancey [...] "Doug" [...] Funnie (Billy West in the Nickelodeon series; Tom McHugh in the Disney series): Doug is {{depicted}} as an introverted, quiet, insecure, and naive 11(later 12)-year-old boy who {{more often than not}} tries to deal with his fears of failure and of social rejection. He has talents for writing, drawing, making music (he plays a banjo), and caring for animals (he owns a dog named Porkchop). While Doug just wants to fit in with his peers, he possesses quite an imagination and a strong sense of morality that both make him stand out amongs them. Doug narrates every episode, and writes his experiences in his journal. His alter ego, Quailman, was inspired by Jinkins' and Roberts' home movies as children, posing as superheroes. Billy West, the original voice behind Doug, was assigned by executive Vanessa Coffey, to Jinkins' initial reluctance. Despite this, he would come to view it as the best possible voice for the character. West, in recording lines for Doug, noted that [...] "There's a lot of me in there, because I'm going through my own experiences in there, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> conscience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark Dunn, a {{spokesman}} for Dion, accused the Tories of making fun of the Liberal leader's hearing issues. Dion responded to Harper's comments, saying Harper had [...] "no class", saying [...] "I {{did not understand the}} question", and [...] "Maybe it's <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hearing problem, maybe because [...] my second language, but I did not understand the question". Both the Conservatives and the CTV have come under criticism for their handling of the footage, but they have stated they stand by their actions. Duceppe has called Harper's comments a [...] "double standard", saying that many English-speaking politicians have little or no ability to speak French, yet francophones are somehow always expected to be perfect, and that the attack was an attempted [...] "low blow". [...] But Duceppe also took the opportunity to criticise Dion, suggesting he understood the question. [...] "The real question is that I think Dion understood the question. [...] The real problem wasn't the language, it was the substance," [...] Duceppe said, [...] "He had nothing to say". Layton also defended Dion, saying he has [...] "struggled with questions, too".|$|E

2500|$|As an Illinois State Senator, Obama {{supported}} Senate bill 0099 for [...] "age and developmentally appropriate" [...] sex education, {{which would}} have allowed parents to choose to withdraw their children from the classes. The bill was endorsed by the Illinois Parent Teacher Association, the Illinois State Medical Society, the Illinois Public Health Association, and the Illinois Education Association. In a debate in 2004, when questioned by Alan Keyes {{about what kind of}} sex education was [...] "age appropriate" [...] for kindergarteners, Obama said, [...] "I'll give you an example, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> six-year-old daughter and a three-year-old daughter, {{and one of the things}} my wife and I talked to our daughter about is the possibility of somebody touching them inappropriately, and what that might mean. And that was included specifically in the law, so that kindergarteners are able to exercise some possible protection against abuse...." [...] In 2007, in response to a similar attack from Mitt Romney, an Obama spokesperson stated his position that communities should determine the curriculum. The Illinois bill did not call for addressing all sex-related issues in kindergarten classes, and Obama has said that he [...] "does not support teaching explicit sex education to children in kindergarten." ...|$|E
2500|$|Declan Ganley, Libertas leader, {{said the}} {{unexpectedly}} high Yes vote demonstrated [...] "how scared people are" [...] {{of the state}} of the economy. This feeling was echoed by a certain proportion of voters, one of whose attitude was [...] "I'm here <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> vote and, basically, I've been told what to do with it". The Socialist Party's MEP Joe Higgins praised the performance of the No campaign. Sinn Féin's President Gerry Adams asked why the first referendum had been ignored. Sinn Féin Vice-President Mary Lou McDonald criticised the [...] "dishonourable and depressing" [...] Yes campaign. Richard Greene of Cóir promised the war against the Treaty would continue despite the second result, saying Cóir was [...] "extremely disappointed that the voice of the people was not heard the first time around". Václav Klaus, President of the Czech Republic, described the vote as [...] "tarnished since this is a repeated referendum". Nigel Farage, leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, said the process had been no different from [...] "a corrupt election in Zimbabwe or Afghanistan". Bruce Arnold, a columnist with the Irish Independent, said the damage done to the disenfranchised by the [...] "tainted outcome" [...] of the referendums would [...] "not be easily fixed".|$|E
2500|$|... "American Boy" [...] {{was written}} by Estelle, will.i.am, John Legend, Kanye West, Josh Lopez, Caleb Speir and Keith Harris. It was also {{produced}} by will.i.am and recorded over the instrumental of his song [...] "Impatient", from his third studio album Songs About Girls (2007). The credits of Lopez, Speir, and Harris {{were the result of}} this sampling. In a 2008 interview with Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul, Estelle explained how the song came to fruition: [...] "We were just messing about in the studio, joking around. And John (Legend) just said to me 'Why don't you write a song about meeting an American boy?'. So I was like 'Well, that's pretty easy' - <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of male friends out there in New York. And I unwittingly ended up creating a new ladies' anthem!" [...] She also spoke about West's involvement on the song, commenting [...] "Kanye basically just brought his own cheeky self to the track, his own sense of humour. At first he was like 'How can you rap over a dance beat?' - and now he's DONE it!" [...] Instrumentation on the track includes drums, keys, synths, and bass; the former were provided by will.i.am while Caleb Speir provided the latter. will.i.am also co-recorded and co-engineered the song with Padriac Kerin at The Record Plant in Hollywood, Florida as well as Hit Factory Criteria and Circle House Studios in Miami. Serge Tsai mixed the song and recorded West's rap at Platinum Sound Recording Studios in New York City.|$|E

5000|$|Kirshner was {{reported}} to have been incensed by the group's unexpected rebellion, especially when he felt they had [...] "modicum talent" [...] when compared to the superstars of the day like John Lennon and Paul McCartney. In the liner notes for Rhino's 2006 Deluxe Edition CD reissue of More of the Monkees, Kirshner stated, [...] "controlled the group <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> contract. <b>I</b> kicked them out of the studio <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> TV show that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to put songs in, and to me it was <b>a</b> business and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to knock off the songs."
