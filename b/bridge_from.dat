5|$|A 1990 CDOT design {{proposal}} for a new bridge was dropped after heavy opposition. In 2004 the city of Aspen {{and the town of}} Snowmass jointly funded design work for another new bridge. CDOT expedited the planning process for the bridge and work began the next year. Construction of the segmental concrete box-girder replacement was complicated by the need to protect the wetlands below, a problem that was solved by building the <b>bridge</b> <b>from</b> the top down and taking measures to allow the concrete piers to be poured and dried during winter.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on {{the second}} day, the {{defenders}} on the bridge saw a small convoy of trucks approaching at some speed from the south, which at first they misidentified as the British XXX Corps. That they were enemy trucks did not become apparent until {{they were on the}} bridge whereupon the defenders opened fire and destroyed the convoy. Soon afterwards, German infantry and armour approached the <b>bridge</b> <b>from</b> the east. One tank reached the space under the bridge before it was destroyed by one of the 6pounder anti-tank guns. At 09:00, thirty armoured cars, half-tracks and trucks from the 9th SS Panzer Division attempted to rush the <b>bridge</b> <b>from</b> the south. The first five armoured cars, using the wrecks of the dawn convoy as cover and with the element of surprise, managed to cross unscathed. The rest of the force was engaged and twelve of their vehicles destroyed with the survivors returning to the southern bank. All day long, the force at the bridge came under fire from mortars and anti-aircraft guns positioned south of the river and were subject to probing infantry and armour attacks.|$|E
5|$|Back at Mina, {{the pilgrims}} perform {{symbolic}} stoning {{of the devil}} (Ramy al-Jamarat) by throwing seven stones at only {{the largest of the}} three pillars, known as Jamrat al-Aqabah from sunrise to sunset. The remaining two pillars (jamarah) are not stoned on this day. These pillars are said to represent Satan. Pilgrims climb ramps to the multi-levelled Jamaraat <b>Bridge,</b> <b>from</b> which they can throw their pebbles at the jamarat. Because of safety reasons, in 2004 the pillars were replaced by long walls, with catch basins below to collect the pebbles.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, US25 {{was changed}} to traffic along a one-way pairing of streets on the {{southwest}} side of Port Huron. Northbound traffic remained on Military Avenue while southbound traffic was diverted to Electric Avenue. Two US25A routings were created in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The first, near Erie, was numbered in 1937, and renumbered US24A by 1945. The second in Port Huron provided access to the Blue Water <b>Bridge</b> <b>from</b> the mainline of the highway starting in 1940. That last segment of US25 to be paved was completed near Port Hope {{at the end of}} the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Mahoning Creek is a Trout-Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery {{from its}} source to the Pennsylvania Route 54 <b>bridge.</b> <b>From</b> {{that point to}} its mouth, it is a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. However, the tributaries Sechler Run, Mauses Creek, and Kase Run are Coldwater Fisheries and Migratory Fisheries, as are the unnamed tributaries of Mahoning Creek.

5|$|Old Gotham, {{the section}} of Gotham City which will become the Arkham City prison, is not yet walled off and has slums, low buildings, a {{shopping}} mall and docks (where Penguin's ship, the Final Offer, is moored).

Across the <b>bridge</b> <b>from</b> Old Gotham is New Gotham, a modern metropolitan area filled with towering skyscrapers.|$|E

Veeru, unaware that Jai {{was wounded in the}} gunfight, is forced to leave for more ammunition. Meanwhile, Jai, who is {{continuing}} the gunfight singlehandedly, decides to sacrifice himself by using his last bullet to ignite dynamite sticks on a <b>bridge</b> <b>from</b> close range.|$|E
5|$|The Congress Street Bridge was on Connecticut Historical Commission's list of bridges. Local {{businesses}} and residents {{have claimed that}} are experiencing reductions in traffic {{as a result of}} the closure of the bridge and that it has increased emergency response times. In 2002, Bridgeport's official historian, Charles W. Brilvitch, stated that the City of Bridgeport promised P. T. Barnum to keep the bridge open and free, forever. The promise was made when the city purchased the previous <b>bridge</b> <b>from</b> Barnum and annexed East Bridgeport in 1864. However, limited funds became a concern, with the money needing to be directed to more important projects.|$|E
5|$|The Skye Bridge {{opened in}} 1995 under a private finance {{initiative}} {{and the high}} tolls charged (£5.70 each way for summer visitors) met with widespread opposition, spearheaded by the pressure group SKAT (Skye and Kyle Against Tolls).

5|$|The {{railway station}} would be {{developed}} into an 'interchange' with local buses and trains. The upgrade {{would provide a}} new platform, footbridge and new station buildings. Outside the station a new road <b>bridge</b> <b>from</b> Midland Road over the railway line is also planned with a new footbridge to reach the new development. Other plans to include {{the development of the}} High Street, Shelley Road and the north of the town areas are also being considered.|$|E

It is in Travelcard Zone 1 {{and is one of}} 19 stations managed by Network Rail. It has been a Grade II listed building since 1970.|$|E

5|$|A 2008 genetic {{study showed}} {{that some of the}} woolly mammoths that entered North America through the Bering land <b>bridge</b> <b>from</b> Asia {{migrated}} back about 300,000 years ago and had replaced the previous Asian population by about 40,000 years ago, not long before the entire species became extinct. Fossils of woolly mammoths and Columbian mammoths have been found together in a few localities of North America, including the Hot Springs sinkhole of South Dakota where their regions overlapped. It is unknown whether the two species were sympatric and lived there simultaneously, or if the woolly mammoths may have entered these southern areas during times when Columbian mammoth populations were absent there.|$|E
5|$|A narrow quay passes {{under the}} old swivel section of the <b>bridge</b> <b>from</b> Waller's Quay to the marina. A well-worn {{handrail}} offers the pedestrian some protection against a slip into the river. This rail has been known as the Duke's Rail since in 1897 the then Duke of York, later to become George V, paid a state visit to Ireland. The royal party travelled up-river from Portumna on the steamship Countess of Mayo. Disembarking at Waller's Quay, the Duke was received by Lord Rosse, the Lord Lieutenant of King's County. The party had to traverse the narrow quay under the bridge to get to Banagher Railway Station, and undoubtedly made good use of the Duke's Rail. The stretch of the Shannon from Portumna to Banagher was {{known for some time}} after as the Duke of York's Route.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} for approximately 11,000 years, based on Clovis points discovered in the area. The first inhabitants were most likely the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede tribes of Native Americans, descendants of the first humans who traveled across the Bering land <b>bridge</b> <b>from</b> Siberia. They fished for salmon, trout, and lamprey, and hunted for deer and elk. They also often set fires to clear brush from prairies and oak savannas, and to promote the growth of certain crops. The fires were limited by the Native Americans, creating a patchwork of burned and unburned land, thus increasing the biodiversity of the watershed.|$|E
