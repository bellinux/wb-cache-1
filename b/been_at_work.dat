5|$|Vulcanoids, {{being an}} entirely new class of {{celestial}} bodies, would be interesting in their own right, but discovering {{whether or not they}} exist would yield insights into the formation and evolution of the Solar System. If they exist they might contain material left over from the earliest period of planet formation, and help determine the conditions under which the terrestrial planets, particularly Mercury, formed. In particular, if vulcanoids exist or did exist in the past, they would represent an additional population of impactors that have affected no other planet but Mercury, making that planet's surface appear older than it actually is. If vulcanoids are found not to exist, this would place different constraints on planet formation and suggest that other processes have <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in the inner Solar System, such as planetary migration clearing out the area.|$|E

The {{self-employed}} Vanzetti had no such alibis and was charged for the attempted robbery and attempted murder in Bridgewater and the robbery and murder in the Braintree crimes. Sacco and Vanzetti were charged with the crime of murder on May 5, 1920 and indicted four months later on September 14.|$|E

25|$|The day-one patch, which Hello Games had <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> at {{since the}} game went gold in July, altered {{several aspects of}} how the procedurally {{generated}} universe was created, such that existing saves from previous copies would no longer work. This patch also removed an exploit that was observed by pre-release players {{that allowed them to}} complete the game much faster than anticipated. Commentators noted that the patch would substantially change the aspects of the game previously critiqued by aforementioned early players, and believed some of the changes were made specifically to address these concerns.|$|E

25|$|The primary aim {{of modern}} warfare (in {{accordance}} {{with the principles of}} doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever {{since the end of the}} nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, {{this claim}} has been challenged. Any order to assassinate Wilson {{would have had}} to have been relayed to them by Rory O'Connor (then in charge of British IRA operations) and the last {{assassination}} attempt contrived against Wilson had been set to be executed in 1921, not 1922. Coogan has suggested that Reginald Dunne, who had the confidence of both Michael Collins and Rory O'Connor, undertook the shooting as a last-ditch effort to provoke the British Government into retaliating, thereby uniting both sides of the Nationalists. Hart believes the assassins “acted alone in the (grossly mistaken) belief that Wilson was responsible for Catholic deaths in Belfast”. The killers had only decided to attack the previous evening, and even on the day Sullivan had <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> until 1pm; the killers had no getaway plan.|$|E
25|$|O'Brian used {{literary}} {{license in}} making Aubrey a Commodore while still a relatively junior captain, however this puts him equal in rank {{to the man}} who led the squadron in history, Commodore Rowley. In the novel, Aubrey was appointed directly by the Admiralty with the help of Maturin's persuasion, as Maturin had <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> on the intelligence side of the project. There are other differences from the historical event, one being that the French captain of the Vénus Hamelin survived the encounter, surrendering to the British, going on to honor in France. In contrast, Captain Corbett's reputation and death aboard ship match that of Robert Corbet, who was captain of Néréide and then given the Africaine when he brought the captured Caroline in to England. Lord Clonfert is fictional, in place of Nesbit Willoughby, who was captain of HMS Néréide; though Willoughby had a spotty career and took many wounds, he survived the battle and lived unmarried. Lord Clonfert takes the same splinter wound to the eye as Willoughby received. In the battle, Pym was taken prisoner by the French in the Battle of Grand Port in August 1810, released only when a later squadron from Cape Town re-took Île de la Passe in December 1810, freeing Pym and others taken prisoner. For the loss of his ship, Pym faced the usual court martial, and was exonerated of blame for the losses. In the novel, it is Captain Lord Clonfert who is left a prisoner in the action, seriously wounded, under the care of his own and French physicians until the squadron arrives under Admiral Bertie to accept the island's capitulation, but he does not live to face a court martial.|$|E

500|$|The {{historian}} Sam Willis {{argued that}} since Wilkinson {{knew it was}} impossible to make a ship invisible with paint, the [...] "extreme opposite" [...] was the answer, using conspicuous shapes and violent colour contrasts to confuse enemy submarine commanders. Willis pointed out, using the [...] dazzle scheme as an example, that different mechanisms could have <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> The contradictory patterns on the ship's funnels could imply the ship was on a different heading (as Wilkinson had said). The curve on the hull below the front funnel could seem to be a false bow wave, creating a misleading impression of the ship's speed. And the striped patterns at bow and stern could create confusion about which end of the ship was which.|$|E
500|$|During the Interregnum, however, squatters had {{occupied}} Windsor Castle. As a result, the [...] "King's {{house was a}} wreck; the fanatic, the pilferer, and the squatter, having <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>work...</b> Paupers had squatted {{in many of the}} towers and cabinets". Shortly after returning to England, Charles appointed Prince Rupert, one of his few surviving close relatives, to be the Constable of Windsor Castle in 1668. Rupert immediately began to reorder the castle's defences, repairing the Round Tower and reconstructing the real tennis court. Charles attempted to restock Windsor Great Park with deer brought over from Germany, but the herds never recovered their pre-war size. Rupert created apartments for himself in the Round Tower, decorated with an [...] "extraordinary" [...] number of weapons and armour, with his inner chambers [...] "hung with tapisserie, curious and effeminate pictures".|$|E
500|$|First unit filming {{began on}} 10 August 1982 at the Berlin Wall {{crossing}} point Checkpoint Charlie, although the second unit had already <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> {{for a few}} weeks, filming scenes for a mid-air fight sequence. The Monsoon Palace served as the exterior of villain Kamal Khan's palace, while scenes set at the palace of titular character Octopussy were filmed at the Lake Palace and Jag Mandir. Bond's hotel was the Shiv Niwas Palace. In England RAF Northolt, RAF Upper Heyford and RAF Oakley were the main locations. Scenes set at the Karl-Marx-Stadt railways scenes were shot at the Nene Valley Railway, while studio work was undertaken at Pinewood Studios and 007 Stage. Filming finished on 21 January 1983. John Barry returned to score, having passed on For Your Eyes Only for tax reasons. While Barry wrote the title song, [...] "All Time High", Tim Rice wrote the lyrics and the song was performed by Rita Coolidge.|$|E

500|$|As many {{as seven}} gangs of resurrectionists may have <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in 1831. [...] The 1828 Select Committee on Anatomy {{believed}} that there were about 200London resurrectionists, most of them working part-time. [...] The London Borough Gang, which operated from about 1802 to 1825, at its peak consisted of at least six men, led first by a former hospital porter named Ben Crouch, and later by a man called Patrick Murphy. [...] Under the protection of Astley Cooper, Crouch's gang supplied some of London's biggest anatomical schools, but relations were not always amicable. [...] In 1816 the gang cut off supplies to the St Thomas Hospital School, demanding an increase of two guineas per corpse. [...] When the school responded by using freelancers, members of the gang burst into the dissecting rooms, threatened the students and attacked the corpses. [...] The police were called, but worried about adverse publicity, the school paid their attackers' bail and opened negotiations. [...] The gang also attempted to put rivals out of business, sometimes by desecrating a graveyard (thereby rendering it unsafe to rob graves from for weeks thereafter) and other times by reporting freelance resurrectionists to the police, recruiting them once freed from prison. [...] Joshua Naples, who wrote The Diary of a Resurrectionist, a list of his activities from 1811–1812, was one such individual. [...] Among entries detailing the graveyards he plundered, the institutions he delivered to, how much he was paid and his drunkenness, Naples diary mentions his gang's inability to work under a full Moon, being unable to sell a body deemed [...] "putrid", and leaving a body thought to be infected with smallpox.|$|E
