5|$|The Gangavadi region {{consisted}} of the malnad region, the plains (Bayaluseemae) and the semi-malnad with lower elevation and rolling hills. The main crops of the malnad region were paddy, <b>betel</b> leaves, cardamom and pepper and the semi-malnad region with its lower altitude produced rice, millets such as ragi and corn, pulses, oilseeds {{and it was also}} the base for cattle farming. The plains to the east were the flat lands fed by Kaveri, Tungabhadra and Vedavati rivers where cultivations of sugarcane, paddy, coconut, areca nut (adeka totta), <b>betel</b> leaves, plantain and flowers (vara vana) were common. Sources of irrigation were excavated tanks, wells, natural ponds and water bodies in the catchment area of dams (Katta). Inscriptions attesting to irrigation of previously uncultivated lands seem to indicate an expanding agrarian community.|$|E
5|$|In {{the metal}} {{manufacturing}} sector, Diesel Locomotive Works {{is a major}} employer. Bharat Heavy Electricals, a large power equipment manufacturer, also operates a heavy equipment maintenance plant. Other major commodities manufactured and traded in Varanasi include hand-knotted Mirzapur carpets, rugs, dhurries, brassware, copperware, wooden and clay toys, handicrafts, gold jewellery, and musical instruments. Important agricultural products include <b>betel</b> leaves (for paan), langra mangoes and khoa (solidified milk).|$|E
5|$|The {{careers of}} Brahmins usually related to education, the judiciary, astrology, mathematics, poetry and {{philosophy}} or {{the occupation of}} hereditary administrative posts. Also Brahmins increasingly practiced non-Brahminical professions (agriculture, trade in <b>betel</b> nuts and martial posts). Capital punishment, although widespread, was not given to the royal Kshatriya sub-castes or to Brahmins found guilty of heinous crimes (as {{the killing of a}} Brahmin in medieval Hindu India was itself considered a heinous crime). As an alternate punishment to enforce the law a Brahmin's right hand and left foot was severed, leaving that person disabled.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture was the empire's {{main source}} of income through taxes on land and produce. The {{majority}} of the people lived in villages and worked farming the staple crops of rice, pulses, and cotton in the dry areas and sugarcane in areas having sufficient rainfall, with areca and <b>betel</b> being the chief cash crops. The living conditions of the labourers who farmed the land must have been bearable as there are no records of revolts by the landless against wealthy landlords. If peasants were disgruntled the common practice was to migrate in large numbers out of the jurisdiction of the ruler who was mistreating them, thereby depriving him of revenue from their labor.|$|E
5|$|ML Pin {{recalled}} {{in his autobiography}} that although {{his mother was a}} kind and loving figure, his father was rather strict and acted more like a teacher than a father, and that he was often fearful of him. A loyal servant of the crown, MR Pia introduced ML Pin to King Vajiravudh when he was seven years old. Another often-recounted story from his childhood is that of how, before having learned to count, when his mother asked him to gather half a bunch of <b>betel</b> leaves for her, ML Pin set down to picking up one leaf with each hand at a time, separating them equally into two piles.|$|E
5|$|Taxes were levied on {{mining and}} forest products, and {{additional}} income was raised through tolls {{for the use}} of transportation facilities. The state also collected fees from customs, professional licenses, and judicial fines. Records show horses and salt were taxed as well as commodities (gold, textiles, perfumes) and agricultural produce (black pepper, paddy, spices, <b>betel</b> leaves, palm leaves, coconuts and sugar). Land tax assessment was based on frequent surveys evaluating the quality of land and the type of produce. Chalukya records specifically mention black soil and red soil lands in addition to wetland, dry land and wasteland in determining taxation rates.|$|E
5|$|The aborigines signalled their {{surrender}} {{by sending}} {{a few of their}} best weapons to the Dutch, and then by bringing a small tree (often <b>betel</b> nut) planted in earth from their village as a token of the granting of sovereignty to the VOC. Over the next few months as word of the Dutch victory spread, more and more villages came to pay their respects at Fort Zeelandia and assure the VOC of their friendly intentions. However, the new masters of Mattau also inherited their enemies, with both Favorlang and Tirosen expressing hostility towards the VOC in the wake of their victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the empire was largely {{dependent}} on agriculture. Sorghum (jowar), cotton, and pulse legumes grew in semi-arid regions, while sugarcane, rice, and wheat thrived in rainy areas. <b>Betel</b> leaves, areca (for chewing), and coconut were the principal cash crops, and large scale cotton production supplied the weaving centers of the empire's vibrant textile industry. Spices such as turmeric, pepper, cardamom, and ginger grew in the remote Malnad hill region and were transported to the city for trade. The empire's capital city was a thriving business centre that included a burgeoning market in large quantities of precious gems and gold. Prolific temple-building provided employment to thousands of masons, sculptors, and other skilled artisans.|$|E
5|$|The Rashtrakuta {{economy was}} {{sustained}} by its natural and agricultural produce, its manufacturing revenues and moneys gained from its conquests. Cotton {{was the chief}} crop of the regions of southern Gujarat, Khandesh and Berar. Minnagar, Gujarat, Ujjain, Paithan and Tagara were important centres of textile industry. Muslin cloth were manufactured in Paithan and Warangal. The cotton yarn and cloth was exported from Bharoch. White calicos were manufactured in Burhanpur and Berar and exported to Persia, Turkey, Poland, Arabia and Egypt. The Konkan region, ruled by the feudatory Silharas, produced large quantities of <b>betel</b> leaves, coconut and rice while the lush forests of Mysore, ruled by the feudatory Gangas, produced such woods as sandal, timber, teak and ebony. Incense and perfumes were exported from the ports of Thana and Saimur.|$|E
5|$|The Roce (anointing) ceremony, {{conducted}} one or {{two days}} before a wedding, celebrates the last day of virginity of the bride and bridegroom and involves the parents' blessing of the bride and groom, who are anointed with roce, a mixture of coconut milk and coconut oil, while a cross is inscribed on the bride's forehead. The marriage traditions include Soirik (betrothal), exchange of Paan Pod (<b>betel</b> leaves) during the marriage ceremony, which known as Badalchen (changing hands; formal acceptance of the promise made by the bride's father to the bridegroom's father that he will give his daughter in marriage). The bride is adorned with the Sado (wedding sari) and Pirduk (wedding necklace). Other rites include the Onpnni (giving away the bride formally by the father or the guardian of the bride), Porthoponn (re-invitation to the bride's house), and singing of Honvious (hymns). Some non-marriage traditions include Novemjeevon (partaking of the food prepared from new corn) and Novem (blessing of new harvests).|$|E
5|$|The Thanjavur Marathas {{gained control}} during the later part of 18th century until its {{annexation}} by the British East India Company in 1799. It was constituted as a municipality during 1866 {{and was a}} part of the erstwhile Tanjore district. The town was the headquarters and the only town in Mannargudi taluk. The town emerged as one of the chief centres of inland trade in the district during the British rule. Rice, <b>betel</b> leaves, groundnut, oil, metal articles and clothes were the major exports. A Methodist mission was established in the town during the third decade of the 19th century. During 1944, Chinese copper coins were unearthed from Thaliketti village in the region, dated to Sui period (585 CE) to the end of Song period (1275 CE). The coins indicate a possible Buddhist influence in the region. Mannargudi continued to be part of Tanjore district until India's independence in 1947 and Thanjavur district until 1991 and subsequently a part of the newly formed Tiruvarur district.|$|E
5|$|Tipu Sultan is {{credited}} to have founded state trading depots in various locations of his kingdom. In addition, he founded depots in foreign locations such as Karachi, Jeddah and Muscat, where Mysore products were sold. During Tipu's rule French technology {{was used for}} the first time in carpentry and smithy, Chinese technology was used for sugar production, and technology from Bengal helped improve the sericulture industry. State factories were established in Kanakapura and Taramandelpeth for producing cannons and gunpowder respectively. The state held the monopoly in the production of essentials such as sugar, salt, iron, pepper, cardamom, <b>betel</b> nut, tobacco and sandalwood, as well as the extraction of incense oil from sandalwood and the mining of silver, gold and precious stones. Sandalwood was exported to China and the Persian Gulf countries and sericulture was developed in twenty-one centers within the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In Bengal and South India, Shashthi is worshipped on {{the sixth}} day after {{childbirth}} and on Aranya-Shashthi (also called Jamai-Shashthi), the sixth day of the bright fortnight of the Hindu month of Jyeshtha. Her worship can be performed in the house, where she is symbolised as an earthenware pitcher; she may also be worshipped outdoors in a natural, open space consecrated to her, termed a shashthitala. In honour of Shashthi, women tie a stone in a small rag to the branch of a tree in the shasthitala: a mother does this to ask for long life for her child, while a barren woman does so to entreat the goddess to aid her in conceiving. The vrata (ritual) performed {{on the day of}} Jamai-Shashthi is also prescribed to be performed by pregnant women at least once on any Monday, Tuesday, Friday or Saturday in the month of Jyestha. Dough images of Shashthi and her black cat are prepared and worshipped, along with a water pitcher with a banyan tree branch near it. <b>Betel</b> nuts and leaves, fruits, sweets and kheer are offered to her in units of six. In North India, Shashthi is worshipped {{in the form of the}} banyan tree, which is sacred to her.|$|E
5|$|As the North West trade {{developed}} {{it became}} riskier to depend solely upon acquiring sea otter furs through {{trade with the}} indigenous people of the coast. Diversification began {{in the first decade}} of the 19th century if not earlier, and increased over time. Maritime fur trading voyages were no longer solely about taking sea otter furs from the North West Coast to Canton. Other commodities and markets throughout the Pacific were added to the system. Sandalwood, mainly from Hawaii, became an important item of the China trade. Just as the sea otter trade was waning the sandalwood trade boomed, peaking in 1821, then declined. Hawaiian sandalwood was depleted by 1830. Fiji and the Marquesas Islands were the other principal sources of sandalwood. Most had been cut by 1820. Fiji was also a source of bêche-de-mer, a gourmet delicacy in China. American traders began acquiring Fijian bêche-de-mer in 1804 and trepanging boomed there. Bêche-de-mer became Fiji's leading export by 1830. Depletion led to a decline and the end of the trade by 1850. Trepanging was also done from 1812 in Hawaii and from 1814 in the Marquesas. Other side trades included Chilean copper from Valparaíso, scrimshaw (whale teeth), tortoise shells and meat from the Galápagos Islands, sugar from Manila, and, from Java, areca nuts (so-called <b>betel</b> nuts) and coffee beans. Sealing boomed in the Juan Fernández Islands and the Juan Fernández fur seal was rapidly exploited to near-extinction. The northern fur seal rookeries were controlled by Russia, so Americans acquired northern fur seal skins through trade rather than sealing.|$|E
25|$|Population of {{the country}} {{did not have a}} bed or chair to sit, and to eat they do not use a spoon or chopsticks. Men and women enjoy chewing <b>betel</b> nut mixed with, <b>betel</b> leaves, and white chalk made from ground mussels shells. They eat rice for meal, first they took a scoop of water and soak <b>betel</b> in their mouth, then wash their hands and sit down to make a circle; getting a plate of rice soaked in butter (probably coconut milk) and gravy, and eat using hands to lift the rice and put it in their mouth. When {{receiving}} guests, they will offer the guests, not the tea, but with <b>betel</b> nut.|$|E
25|$|<b>Betel</b> nut chewing is {{associated}} with an increased risk of squamous cell cancer of the head and neck.|$|E
25|$|Offerings {{are usually}} {{placed at the}} altar or shrine once in the evening, at sunrise and later at sundown. The basic offerings are a pair of white candles, three joss sticks and burning gum Benjamin (kemenyan). Datuk worshippers prepare special offerings for the Na Tuk on Thursday evenings. A set of <b>betel</b> nut leaves {{complete}} with lime (kapur), sliced <b>betel</b> nut (pinang), Javanese tobacco (tembakau Jawa), and palm cigarette leaves (rokok daun), are offered together with fruits and the basic offerings.|$|E
25|$|The type {{member of}} Arecaceae is the areca palm, {{the fruit of}} which, the areca nut, is chewed with the <b>betel</b> leaf for intoxicating effects (Areca catechu).|$|E
25|$|Inscriptions {{reveal that}} 400 dancers, {{along with their}} gurus and orchestras, were {{maintained}} by the Brihadeesvarar temple, Thanjavur, with munificent grants, including the daily disbursement of oil, turmeric, <b>betel</b> leaves and nuts.|$|E
25|$|Gutka is a {{preparation}} of crushed <b>betel</b> nut, tobacco, and sweet or savory flavorings. It is manufactured in India and exported {{to a few}} other countries. A mild stimulant, it is sold across India in small, individual-sized packets.|$|E
25|$|According to a 6th-centuryAD source, Kalinga {{was famous}} for its elephants, for which it found a market in Ceylon, along with {{precious}} stones, ivory, pepper, <b>betel</b> nuts and fine textiles. In return, Kalinga imported pearl and silver from Ceylon.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{authorities}} in England were stubborn, and due to the pressure they exerted, the monopoly of tobacco and <b>betel</b> nut was stopped on 1 September 1767, followed by the annulment of the salt monopoly on 7 October 1768.|$|E
25|$|The forests {{around the}} temple have coconut, {{plantain}} and <b>betel</b> leaf plants and trees. Hence, {{it is also}} said that during a severe famine, the goddess provided vegetables and food for the people to survive and thus, the goddess was given the name Shakambari.|$|E
25|$|Transient surface {{discoloration}} of {{the tongue}} and other soft tissues in the mouth can occur {{in the absence of}} hairy tongue. Causes include smoking (or <b>betel</b> chewing), some foods and beverages (e.g., coffee, tea or liquorice), and certain medications (e.g., chlorhexidine, iron salts, or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol)).|$|E
25|$|Worshippers usually offer fresh flowers, sireh (<b>betel</b> nuts), rokok daun (local hand-rolled cigarettes), sliced pinang (areca nuts) {{and local}} fruits. An {{important}} part of the praying ritual is also to burn some kemenyan, the gum Benjamin. If their prayers are answered, the worshippers usually return to the shrine to make offerings or hold a kenduri (feast) in thanksgiving.|$|E
25|$|Fishing {{and hunting}} {{supplemented}} the main rice crop. Arrowheads and spears were dipped in poison to kill larger {{animals such as}} elephants. <b>Betel</b> nuts were widely chewed and the lower classes rarely wore clothing more substantial than a loincloth. Every spring, a fertility festival was held which featured huge parties and sexual abandon. Religion consisted of primitive animistic cults.|$|E
25|$|Lunch in India usually {{consists}} of a main dish of rice {{in the south and}} east, or whole wheat rotis in the north and west. It typically includes two or three kinds of vegetables, and sometimes items such as kulcha, naan, or parathas. Along with dessert, paan (<b>betel</b> leaves), which aid digestion, are often eaten after lunch in parts of India.|$|E
25|$|Before {{assuming}} {{power of}} the Tanjore kingdom, Sevvappa had distinguished himself under Krishnadavaraya as an administrator and a builder. Sevappa's wife Murtimamba was the sister-in-law of Achyuta Deva Raya and the sister of the Vijayanagara Queen, Thirumalamba. Some sources suggest that Sevappa acquired the Thanjavur Kingdom as stridhana (dowry) from Achyutadeva Raya. Sevappa was also a ceremonial <b>betel</b> bearer to Achyuta Deva Raya, the brother of Krishnadevaraya.|$|E
25|$|The Anthropological Survey of India {{identified}} that in Gujarat, Rajputs are 'by and large' non-vegetarians, regular drinkers of alcohol, and also smoke and chew <b>betel</b> leaves. These traits are also followed by Rajputs of Maharashtra with mutton, chicken and fish being consumed; and also pork (which historically {{dates back to}} the predilection for Rajput warriors and princes to hone their fighting skills by hunting and eating wild-pig).|$|E
25|$|A corpse {{was placed}} within the coffin with all body {{cavities}} filled with <b>betel</b> sap, along with finery and heirlooms. Plates and saucers {{could be placed}} under the head like a pillow, or over the face and chest, in some areas some corpses could be adorned with masks or mouthpieces made of gold. Deceased infants, newborns, or aborted babies were buried in crocks or jars, even Chinese porcelain.|$|E
25|$|About 75% of {{head and}} neck cancer {{is due to the}} use of alcohol or tobacco. Other risk factors include <b>betel</b> quid, certain types of human papillomavirus, {{radiation}} exposure, certain workplace exposures, and Epstein-Barr virus. Head and neck cancers are most commonly of the squamous cell carcinoma type. The diagnosis is confirmed by tissue biopsy. The degree of spread may be determined by medical imaging and blood tests.|$|E
25|$|The kingdom {{was divided}} into Mandalas (provinces) or Desha. Under a Mandala was Vishayas (districts). A total of nine Vishaya have been identified. Under a Vishaya were Mahagramas (Taluk) and Dashagramas (Hobli). Mahagrama had more villages than Dashagramas. One sixth of land produce was {{collected}} as tax. Taxes were collected as Perjunka (levy on load), Vaddaravula (social security tax for royal family), Bilkoda (salex tax), Kirukula (land tax), Pannaya (<b>betel</b> tax) and other professional taxes on traders etc.|$|E
25|$|In 1764, {{following}} the {{victory at the}} Battle of Buxar, the British began to control all the revenues of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. Robert Clive, who returned as Governor-General in 1765, made the sale of tobacco, <b>betel</b> nut, and salt (apart from other accessories and essential spices and condiments), the monopoly of the senior officers of the British East India Company. Contracts were given to deliver salt to depots, and merchants were required to buy from these depots.|$|E
25|$|Rarely, a persistent, non-healing mouth ulcer {{may be a}} {{cancerous}} lesion. Malignancies in {{the mouth}} are usually carcinomas, but lymphomas, sarcomas and others may also be possible. Either the tumor arises in the mouth, or it may grow to involve the mouth, e.g. from the maxillary sinus, salivary glands, nasal cavity or peri-oral skin. The {{most common type of}} oral cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. The main causes are long-term smoking and alcohol consumption (particularly together) and <b>betel</b> use.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 19th century, colonial Penang thrived from trade in pepper and spices, Indian piece goods, <b>betel</b> nut, tin, opium and rice. The Bengal Presidency {{was aware of}} Penang's {{potential}} {{as an alternative to}} Dutch Moluccas as a source of spice production. Spice cultivation on Penang Island became the chief means of covering administrative costs in Penang. The development of the spice economy drove the movement of Chinese settlers to Penang Island, which was actively encouraged by the British.|$|E
25|$|Lễ Đám Hỏi (betrothal ceremony): Some {{time before}} the wedding, the groom and his family visit the bride and her family with round {{lacquered}} boxes known as betrothal presents. The quantity of boxes must be an odd number. The presents include areca nuts, <b>betel</b> leaves, tea, cake, fruits, wine, other various delicacies and money. The presents are covered with red paper or cloth, and they are carried by unmarried girls or boys. Both families agree to pick a good date for the wedding.|$|E
