25|$|A <b>bee</b> <b>smoker,</b> {{usually called}} simply a smoker, is a device used in {{beekeeping}} to calm honey bees. It {{is designed to}} generate smoke from the smouldering of various fuels, hence the name. The first <b>bee</b> <b>smoker,</b> which incorporated a bellows with a fire pot, was invented in 1870 by the renowned American beekeeper, Moses Quinby.|$|E
2500|$|Honey is {{collected}} from wild bee colonies, or from domesticated beehives. The honey {{is stored in}} honeycombs. [...] Wild bee nests are sometimes located by following a honeyguide bird. [...] The bees may first be pacified by using smoke from a <b>bee</b> <b>smoker.</b> [...] The smoke triggers a feeding instinct (an attempt to save {{the resources of the}} hive from a possible fire), making them less aggressive and the smoke obscures the pheromones the bees use to communicate.|$|E

50|$|Barry later {{returns to}} express his {{gratitude}} to Vanessa, breaking the sacred rule that bees {{are not supposed to}} communicate with humans. Barry and Vanessa develop a close bond, bordering on attraction, and spend time together frequently. Later, while Barry and Vanessa are walking through a grocery store, Barry is terrified to discover that the humans have been stealing and eating the bees' honey for centuries. He decides to journey to Honey Farms, which supplies the grocery store with its honey. Furious at the poor treatment of the bees in the hive, including the use of <b>bee</b> <b>smokers</b> to subdue the colony, Barry decides to sue the human race {{to put an end to}} the exploitation of bees.|$|R
40|$|We {{observed}} a large spike in terpene emissions {{and a reduction}} in concentration of within-needle terpenes while sampling volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from Great Basin bristlecone pine, GBBP (Pinus longeava Bailey) and limber pine (Pinus flexilis James) during the Carpenter 1 Fire (July, 2013) on Mount Charleston northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. We hypothesize that exposure to smoke induced the observed changes in terpene emissions and concentrations. We tested this hypothesis by applying smoke to trees and measuring subsequent changes to VOCs and foliage flammability. Smoke from smoldering conifer needles was applied hourly (5 min per hour) to an apical branch (45 cm) of four GBBP and four limber pines using commercial <b>bee</b> <b>smokers.</b> VOCs were then measured from each branch and from four unsmoked control trees from each of the two species (GBBP and limber). We found that VOCs from the branches exposed to smoke increased approximately 3 fold over the controls during the 42 hour test period. In the laboratory, foliar fuel moisture and flammability of the needles from each treatment was measured (fuel moisture, time to ignition, duration of flaming, temperature at ignition, and maximum temperature). Of the variables measured only fuel moisture showed statistically significant differences. To determine if observed VOC response is unique to conifers we repeated the experiment using tomato plants (Solanum esculentum). Smoke-induced changes in VOCs may have important consequences for tree flammability and increased exposure to smoke may stress trees affecting the tree’s natural defenses...|$|R

50|$|He {{kept his}} {{equipment}} {{in the trunk of}} his car. In addition to cameras and tripods, he had a machete, shovel, child’s white parasol, <b>bee</b> <b>smoker,</b> compass, toilet paper, and galoshes and old shoes for swamp jobs. The machete and shovel were used to cut down or remove anything from weeds to saplings that {{got in the way of}} his camera angle. The parasol, spotted and stained, replaced the usual flashgun reflector when he needed a softer light. The compass helped him figure his lighting when he was caught in strange territory without sunlight. The <b>bee</b> <b>smoker</b> provided wisps of smoke to create mood or hide a distracting element. Toilet paper was wrapped around flash bulbs to get a diffused light.|$|E

Root (1840-1928) revised the book to bring it up to date and added more illustrations.|$|E

40|$|Premise of the study: An {{efficient}} and inexpensive system {{was developed to}} produce smoke solutions from plant material to research the influence of water-soluble compounds from smoke on seed germination. Methods and Results: Smoke solutions (300 mL per batch) were produced by burning small quantities (100 – 200 g) of dried plant material {{from a range of}} species in a <b>bee</b> <b>smoker</b> attached by a heater hose to a side-arm flask. The flask was attached to a vacuum water aspirator, to pull the smoke through the water. The entire apparatus was operated in a laboratory fume hood. Conclusions: Compared with other smoke solution preparation systems, the system described is easy to assemble and operate, inexpensive to build, and effective at producing smoke solutions from desired species in a small indoor space. Quantitative measurements can be made when using this system, allowing for replication of the process...|$|E
30|$|All studies {{involving}} {{animals were}} approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. The same studies and exchange of biological samples were also approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler. The ovine model of cotton smoke-induced ISIALI in awake animals was used in these studies, as we previously reported [5]. In the model, a total of 48 puffs of cotton bark smoke cooled to <[*] 40  °C in 4 sets of 12 breaths was delivered via the tracheostomy tube by a modified <b>bee</b> <b>smoker</b> to induce ISIALI. A total of 46 sheep with ISIALI were utilized in this study, including those that were ventilated by either adaptive pressure ventilation/controlled mandatory ventilation (APVcmv; Group 1, n[*]=[*] 14) or synchronized controlled mandatory ventilation, (SCMV; Group 2, n[*]=[*] 32) using a Hamilton G 5 ventilator (Hamilton Medical, Inc., Reno NV). Interventional agents were nebulized using an Aeroneb® Pro vibrating mesh nebulizer (Aerogen, Mountain View, CA). In addition, another 3 naive (No any interventions i.e., no surgical procedure, no injury, no tracheostomy and ventilation) animals and 2 sham animals ventilated with the APVcmv for 48  h were used as non-ISIALI controls, so that a total of 51 sheep were used in this study. The ventilator parameters included the tidal volume[*]=[*] 12  mL/kg; frequency[*]=[*] 20 breaths/min; Positive end expiratory pressure; peep[*]=[*] 5 cmH 2 O; time of inspiration to total respiratory cycle time; i/e[*]=[*] 1 : 2; heated/humidified inspired gas to 33  °C, with fractional concentration of oxygen; FiO 2 [*]=[*] 1, with all parameters constant to 3  h post injury, then titrated to maintain a PaO 2 [*]≥[*] 100  mmHg with frequency adjusted to maintain the PaCO 2 close to 30 – 40  mmHg.|$|E
