25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1797, Coleridge attempted to complete the poem for a 1797 edition of his poems. However, {{he was unable to}} finish and was discouraged by Lamb's words. He soon replaced the poem with Ode to the Departing Year in the collection. The Destiny of Nations was expanded and those lines were published in the 26 December 1797 Morning Post as The Visions of the Maid of Orleans: A Fragment. Coleridge continued trying to finish the poem in 1798, but he abandoned the poem at the end of 1799 until taking it <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> in mid-1814.

25|$|One {{method of}} {{learning}} to ski for LW3 competitors with cerebral palsy is the American Teaching System. They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and {{how to put it}} on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, and then how to fall down and get <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> The skier then learns how to do a straight run, and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift. This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns.|$|E
25|$|The fleet {{has been}} {{refurbished}} several times, and several liveries have been used, the original livery used at opening was yellow and white. A mid-life refurbishment of the fleet, carried out in-house, {{took place between}} 1995 and 2000, and a red, green or blue livery was adopted. Another full refurbishment of the fleet took place between 2010 and 2015: known as the 'three-quarter-life' refurbishment, the Metrocars were refurbished by Wabtec Rail at its Doncaster facility, with the main goal being to extend their service life until 2025. Each car was stripped down to its frame and built <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> {{with the addition of}} improved disabled access, new door control systems, and renewed interiors, seating and lighting. A new yellow and black livery was also adopted.|$|E
25|$|In {{teaching}} skiers with cerebral palsy, {{instructors are}} encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encouraged as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement.

25|$|One of the para-Alpine skiing {{techniques}} used by this class {{is called the}} three track method, and was developed {{as part of the}} American Training System. One of the first skills learned using this technique is how to walk with the ski so the skier can learn how to flex the ankle, knee and hip. This allows the skier to determine their centre of gravity. The skier is then taught how hop turn in order to understand arm and leg coordination while on skis. This technique is only used while stationary and is not a competition skill. The skier next learns how to fall down and get <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> The next skill learned is climbing gentle terrain, followed by learning to go down a straight run and learning to stop. After this, the skier learns how to get on and off a ski lift. This is followed by learning how to traverse the fall line, which teaches the skier how to maintain the ski edge. Other skills are then taught including the Uphill Christie, beginning turns, parallel turns, short swings and moguls.|$|E

500|$|The Drug in Me Is You {{has been}} {{described}} as post-hardcore and pop punk. The songs also included synths, pop-choruses, and other sounds. Radke commented on the inclusion of different genres in songs, comparing different parts of the same song to the sounds of Norma Jean, Underoath, and Katy Perry. Lyrically, according to Radke, some of the songs on the album had tones of being arrogant, comparing the attitude to that commonly found in rap music. This is because Radke has cited Eminem as one of his major influences, so much so that he even included a beat made by Eminem and Dr. Dre during a breakdown on the track [...] "Sink or Swim". In an interview, Radke's experiences were compared to Eminem's, noting that, [...] " [...] is someone who has been knocked down and knocked down, and he’s gotten <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> Time and time again. And he’s triumphed." [...] While the album itself was written during Radke's time in prison, he does not consider it a [...] "Jailhouse record", though some songs that did not make the album do address a prison theme.|$|E

Some {{temporary}} lakes rose to an elevation of more than , flooding the Willamette Valley to Eugene, Oregon and beyond. Iceberg rafted glacial erratics and erosion features are evidence of these events. Lake-bottom sediments deposited by the floods {{have contributed to the}} agricultural richness of the Willamette and Columbia Valleys. Glacial deposits overlaid with centuries of windblown sedimentsl (loess) have scattered steep, southerly-sloping dunes throughout the Columbia Valley, ideal conditions for orchard and vineyard development at higher latitudes.|$|R

[...] She adds that [...] "with each blow that life delivers [...] bobs <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> almost asking for more trouble, more pain, more suffering." [...] Dot is renowned for being a hypochondriac, her Christian faith and quoting from the Bible. She has been described by Rupert Smith, author of 20 Years in Albert Square, as [...] "God-bothering" [...] and self-righteous. According to Kingsley, [...] "nothing shakes Dot's view that the world is good because the creator made it so. Her faith sustains her through the most appalling ordeals." [...] The character once expressed {{part of the reason for}} her faith on-screen in 2000, commenting to a vicar, [...] "I couldn't manage without my faith, not with the life I've had"; former executive producer of EastEnders, John Yorke, has stated that this is his favourite line of EastEnders' entire existence. Author Antony Slide has noted that Dot's religious beliefs have given her solace, but has given her an excuse to be prejudiced against her neighbours, and to deal with the criminal antics of her wayward son. He described her as a [...] "simpleminded woman whom one loved to hate".|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{performed}} [...] "Oh Father" [...] on her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour with [...] "Live to Tell", {{during the}} second segment of the show. As the performance of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] ended, Madonna, who {{was dressed in a}} clergyman's robe with a crucifix around her neck, and a veil around her head, knelt on a church nave, while incense fumes wafted around her. She started singing [...] "Live to Tell" [...] from a confession bench, with Roman columns and a platform full of votive candles in the background. In the middle of the song, she started singing [...] "Oh Father" [...] while a dancer in a black frock played the role of a priest. The dancer, Carlton Wilborn, recalled that this performance required a lot of rehearsal time, since the dance portrayed Madonna as a woman trying to find her religion. He explained: [...] "One side knew she needed it, another side was resistant, and our dance represented that battle inside." [...] At the end of the performance, Wilborn pushed down Madonna's head before pulling her <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> thus portraying his role as the priest, trying to wake up Madonna to the importance of religion. Two different performances were taped and released on video, the Blond Ambition – Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.|$|E

Cranston stated that, though he enjoyed doing comedy, he decided he ... should really focus on doing something else. But I think any good drama worth its weight always has a sprinkling of comedy in it, because you can ease the tension to an audience when it's necessary, and then build it <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b> Walt White has no clue he's occasionally funny, but as an actor, I recognize when there are comedic moments and opportunities.|$|E
