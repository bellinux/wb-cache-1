25|$|Phenyldichloroarsine, NATO {{abbreviation}} PD, is {{an organic}} arsenical vesicant and vomiting agent developed by Germany and France {{for use as}} a chemical warfare agent during World War I. The agent is known by multiple synonyms and is technically classified as a vesicant, or <b>blister</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E
25|$|After World War I, the United States built a {{stockpile}} of 20,000 tonnes of weaponized lewisite (ClCH=CHAsCl2), a vesicant (<b>blister</b> <b>agent)</b> and lung irritant. The stockpile was neutralized with bleach and {{dumped into the}} Gulf of Mexico in the 1950s. During the Vietnam War, the United States used Agent Blue, a mixture of sodium cacodylate and its acid form, {{as one of the}} rainbow herbicides to deprive North Vietnamese soldiers of foliage cover and rice.|$|E
25|$|Anniston {{is home to}} the Anniston Army Depot {{which is}} used for the {{maintenance}} of most Army tracked vehicles. The depot also housed a major chemical weapons storage facility, the Anniston Chemical Activity, and a program to destroy those weapons, the Anniston Chemical Agent Disposal Facility. In 2003, the Anniston Army Depot began the process of destroying the chemical weapons it had stored at the depot and at Fort McClellan. An incinerator was built to destroy the stockpile of Sarin, VX nerve agent, and mustard <b>blister</b> <b>agent</b> stored at the depot. Destruction of the weapons was completed in 2011. The incinerator and related operations were officially closed in May 2013, and the incinerator was disassembled and removed from the depot at the end of 2013.|$|E

50|$|Nerve agents (specifically, tabun, sarin, and cyclosarin) and <b>blister</b> <b>agents</b> (specifically, sulfur-mustard and lewisite) were {{detected}} at Iraqi sites.|$|R
50|$|Occasionally, {{phosgene}} oxime {{is included}} among the <b>blister</b> <b>agents,</b> {{although it is}} more properly termed a nettle agent (urticant).|$|R
25|$|Gas mask {{development}} {{since has}} mirrored {{the development of}} chemical agents in warfare, filling {{the need to protect}} against ever more deadly threats, biological weapons, and radioactive dust in the nuclear era. However, where agents that cause harm through contact or penetration of the skin occurs, such as <b>blister</b> <b>agent</b> or nerve agent, a gas mask alone is not sufficient protection, and full protective clothing must be worn in addition, to protect from contact with the atmosphere. For reasons of civil defense and personal protection, individuals often buy gas masks believing that they protect against the harmful effects of an attack with nuclear, biological, or chemical (NBC) agents; which is only partially true, as gas masks protect only against respiratory absorption. Whilst most military gas masks are designed to be capable of protection against all NBC agents, they can have filter canisters proof against those agents (heavier) or only against riot control agents and smoke (lighter, and often used for training purposes); likewise there are lightweight masks solely for use in riot control agents and not for NBC situations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{initial phase}} of Operation Red Hat {{involved}} {{the movement of}} chemical munitions from a depot storage site to Tengan Pier, eight miles away, and required 1,332 trailers in 148 convoys. The {{second phase of the}} operation moved the munitions to Johnston Atoll. The Army leased [...] on Johnston Atoll. Phase I of the operation took place in January and moved 150 tons of distilled mustard (HD), a <b>blister</b> <b>agent</b> chemically identical to mustard agent (H), manufactured by either the Levinstein or Thiodiglycol processes, but purified further {{so that it can be}} stored longer before polymerizing. The [...] arrived at Johnston Atoll with a load of HD projectiles on January 13, 1971.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, North Korea {{received}} Soviet and Chinese aid in developing its chemical industry. In 1979, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency believed that North Korea [...] "had only a defensive CW capability." [...] It is unclear when North Korea [...] "acquired the capability for independent CW production"; estimates {{range from the}} 1970s to early 1980s. However, [...] "by the late 1980s, North Korea's CW capabilities had expanded; the South Korean Ministry of National Defense reported in 1987 that the North [...] "possessed up to 250 metric tons of chemical weapons" [...] including mustard (a <b>blister</b> <b>agent)</b> and some nerve agents. In 2009 the International Crisis Group reported that the consensus expert view was that North Korea had a stockpile of about 2,500 to 5,000 metric tons of chemical weapons, including mustard gas, sarin (GB) and other nerve agents. The South Korean Ministry of National Defense had the same estimate in 2010. In 2014, the South Korean Defense Ministry estimated that [...] "the North had stockpiled 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical weapons and had a capacity to produce a variety of biological weapons." [...] In 2015, the U.S. Department of Defense reported to Congress that North Korea's CW program [...] "likely possesses a CW stockpile" [...] and likely had [...] "the capability to produce nerve, blister, blood, and choking agents." [...] The report also found that [...] "North Korea probably could employ CW agents by modifying a variety of conventional munitions, including artillery and ballistic missiles. In addition, North Korean forces are prepared to operate in a contaminated environment; they train regularly in chemical defense operations." [...] The report indicated that North Korea [...] "continues to develop its biological research and development capabilities" [...] and [...] "may consider the use of biological weapons as an option, contrary to its obligations under the Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention." ...|$|E

50|$|Thiodiglycol is a Chemical Weapons Convention {{schedule}} 2 chemical used in {{the production}} of sulfur-based <b>blister</b> <b>agents</b> such as mustard gas. Thiodiglycol is also a product of the hydrolysis of mustard gas. It can be detected in the urine of casualties.|$|R
50|$|The Soviet Union {{and later}} Russian Federation experimented with binary munitions capable of mixing and distributing two agents {{that would work}} {{together}} in worsening the weapon's effects, an example {{of which would be}} the combination of nerve <b>agents</b> with <b>blister</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Blistering</b> <b>agents</b> are {{chemical}} substances used to irritate tissues, leading to inflammation, increased circulation, necrosis, and scarring. They may be applied topically or injected. The {{most commonly used}} external (topical) <b>blistering</b> <b>agents</b> contain iodine, mercuric iodide, or turpentine, which are rubbed or brushed onto the skin overlaying the site of injury, and while they cause scaling of the skin, they tend to produce only low levels of soreness. Stronger blistering solutions may be made using red mercuric iodide. These {{require the use of}} a neck cradle, and the horse risks laminitis and lymphangitis if not walked regularly. Blistering is used for a variety of lameness problems, including splints, curbs, sore shins, tendonitis, suspensory desmitis, and sesamoiditis.|$|R
50|$|Lyngbyatoxin-a is a cyanotoxin {{produced}} by certain cyanobacteria species, most notably Moorea producens (formerly Lyngbya majuscula). It is produced as defense mechanism {{to ward off}} any would-be predators of the bacterium, being a potent <b>blister</b> <b>agent</b> as well as carcinogen. Low concentrations cause a common skin condition known as seaweed dermatitis.|$|E
50|$|A post-war case {{occurred}} on January 9, 2004, when Icelandic munitions experts and Danish military engineers discovered 36 120-mm mortar rounds containing liquid buried in Southern Iraq.
