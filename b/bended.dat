As Winge already noted, the front {{margin of the}} zygomatic plate hardly extends forward before the antorbital bridge, which connects the plate {{to the body of}} the skull. This feature distinguishes J.anoblepas from Wilfredomys and many oryzomyines, but the zygomatic plate of living Juliomys species closely resembles that of J.anoblepas. In addition, the connection between the zygomatic plate and the antorbital bridge is inserted higher on the rostrum in Wilfredomys. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) spread broadly. More than in other Juliomys species, the front part of the zygomatic arches is <b>bended</b> forward and the zygomatic plates are <b>bended</b> outward. Furthermore, the zygomatic notch, the notch between the zygomatic plate and arch, is deep, not shallow as in J.ossitenuis and J.rimofrons.|$|E

The {{results show that the}} cross-sectional deformation and the wall thickness variation during NC <b>bending</b> of TA 18 tubes using a small <b>bending</b> radius (less than 2 times of tube outside diameter) are clearly different from that using a normal <b>bending</b> radius (between 2 and 4 times of tube outside diameter). For <b>bending</b> with a normal <b>bending</b> radius, with or without a mandrel, the distribution of the flattening in the <b>bending</b> area resembles a platform and an asymmetric parabola, respectively. For <b>bending</b> with a small <b>bending</b> radius, with or without a mandrel, the flattening both distributes like a parabola, but the former has a stable peak which deflects toward the initial <b>bending</b> section, and the latter has a more pronounced peak with a <b>bending</b> angle and deflects slightly toward the <b>bending</b> section. The wall thickness variations with a normal <b>bending</b> radius, with and without a mandrel, both resemble a platform when the <b>bending</b> angle exceeds a certain angle. For the <b>bending</b> with a small radius, the distribution of the wall thickness variation without a mandrel follows an approximate parabola which increases in value as the <b>bending</b> angle increases.

After his death, his fellow Dane Herluf Winge described Lund's collections in detail, among many others publishing a monograph about the rodents of the collection in 1887. Winge described numerous new species, many of which received little attention from systematists afterward, and among these is the species he named Calomys anoblepas. The specific name, anoblepas, derives from the Greek [...] (ano) [...] "upwards" [...] and [...] (blepo) [...] "to look" [...] and thus means [...] "looking upward". Although Winge did not explain the name, it most likely refers to the zygomatic plate (a bone plate {{at the side of}} the skull), which is <b>bended</b> outward. Winge understood the genus Calomys in a sense very different from that used today, including in it the species Calomys longicaudatus (currently Oligoryzomys nigripes), Calomys coronatus (currently Euryoryzomys russatus), Calomys rex (currently Sooretamys angouya), Calomys laticeps (currently Cerradomys subflavus), Calomys saltator (currently Hylaeamys laticeps), and Calomys plebejus (currently Delomys, species uncertain).
