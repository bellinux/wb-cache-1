5|$|After the {{establishment}} of Bodø/Glimts in 1916 and Grand Bodø the following year, the clubs played at various locations throughout the town. The primary venue for the clubs' elite teams was Bodø Station. By 1962, plans had surfaced for a central stadium for the prime sports clubs. The interest spurred a large protest meeting organized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> sports clubs in town {{in support of the}} municipality building a new venue. Two locations were considered: at Plassmyra, now the location of the Norwegian Aviation Museum, and at Aspmyra. The latter was chosen and the plans were passed by the municipal council in 1963.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the vast}} {{size of its}} coma, Halley's nucleus is {{relatively}} small: barely 15kilometers long, 8kilometers wide and perhaps 8kilometers thick. Its shape vaguely resembles that of a peanut. Its mass is relatively low (roughly 2.2kg) and its average density is about 0.6g/cm3, indicating that it is made {{of a large number}} of small pieces, held together very loosely, forming a structure known as a rubble pile. Ground-based observations of coma brightness suggested that Halley's rotation period was about 7.4 days. Images taken <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> spacecraft, along with observations of the jets and shell, suggested a period of 52hours. Given the irregular shape of the nucleus, Halley's rotation is likely to be complex. Although only 25% of Halley's surface was imaged in detail during the flyby missions, the images revealed an extremely varied topography, with hills, mountains, ridges, depressions, and at least one crater.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, the British {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to integrate the}} princely states more closely with British India, in 1921 creating the Chamber of Princes as a consultative and advisory body, and in 1936 transferring {{the responsibility for the}} supervision of smaller states from the provinces to the centre and creating direct relations between the Government of India and the larger princely states, superseding political agents. A more ambitious aim was a scheme of federation contained in the Government of India Act 1935, which envisaged the princely states and British India being united under a federal government. This scheme came close to success, but was abandoned in 1939 {{as a result of the}} outbreak of the Second World War. As a result, in the 1940s the relationship between the princely states and the crown remained regulated by the principle of paramountcy and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> treaties between the British crown and the states.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that the historic worldwide population numbered 1,100,000 before commercial sperm whaling {{began in the early}} eighteenth century. By 1880 it had declined by an estimated 29 percent. From that date until 1946, the population appears to have partially recovered as whaling activity decreased, and after World War II, the whale population increases to 33 percent of the pre-whaling population. Between 184,000 and 236,000 sperm whales were killed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> whaling nations in the nineteenth century, while in the twentieth century, at least 770,000 were taken, the majority between 1946 and 1980.|$|E

5|$|MDOT assigns {{the numbers}} for a {{parallel}} system of county-designated highways in the state; the numbers are assigned in a grid system by the department. These highways, while signed from connecting trunklines and shown on the official MDOT map, are maintained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> counties. They were started in 1970 {{as a supplement to}} the main trunkline system and carry a letter-number combination on the national standard pentagon-shaped marker in blue and yellow. The letter component of the name corresponds to a zone of the state; zones A–F are in the Lower Peninsula while G and H are in the Upper Peninsula. The numbers correspond to a numbered grid within each lettered zone. Other county systems are designated and maintained in each of the 83counties, and signage and numbering practices vary. The state's 533incorporated cities and villages also maintain their own street networks, but townships in the state have no jurisdiction over roads.|$|E

Meanwhile, after protracted negotiations between the governments of Australia, Britain, Canada, India, New Zealand and South Africa, agreement had been reached to establish an integrated formation with the aim of increasing the political significance of their contribution, as well as facilitating the solution of the logistic and operational problems faced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> Commonwealth contingents.|$|E

The nuclear warheads in the missiles {{were supposed to}} have been removed before the missiles were taken from their storage bunker. The missiles with the nuclear warheads were not reported missing, and remained mounted to the aircraft at both Minot and Barksdale for 36 hours. During this period, the warheads were not protected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> mandatory security precautions for nuclear weapons.|$|E

The examination of the cartridge relies on the unique tool marks left <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> parts of the weapon including the firing pin and the ejector in semi and fully automatic firearms. These markings can be compared and matched to known exemplars fired from the same weapon using the same parts. The examination of the marks left on the cartridge is done using a comparison microscope. Examiners view the questioned cartridge and the known exemplar simultaneously, looking for similar microscopic marks left during the firing process.|$|E
5|$|Springbok colours is {{the name}} given to green and gold blazers awarded {{to members of the}} South Africa {{national}} rugby union team.

With the arrival of South Africa's new post-apartheid government in 1994, the name 'Springbok' was abandoned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> control boards since they felt that the term had been abused by the previous apartheid governments, and stigmatised by the anti-apartheid movement.

5|$|The Kangchu system {{facilitated}} {{the growth of}} the gambier and pepper plantations and developed Johor's and Singapore's economies in the 19th century. The development of Johor's inland towns were attributed to the efforts <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> Kangchu, who were responsible for drawing the settlement plan for the coolies living within the plantation they were working on, from which new towns were formed. The Chinese immigrant population in Johor and Singapore grew in size during this period; Riau also experienced a similar growth during the 18th century. As a result of mass immigration by the Chinese into Johor, the Chinese quickly outnumbered the Malays in the state, although many Chinese coolies relocated to Singapore or other parts of Malaya as the gambier and pepper industry declined in the 20th century. Several towns and other places in Johor and Singapore, built upon sites of former gambier and pepper plantations, are named after former features of the Kangchu system, and are largely populated by ethnic Chinese.|$|E
