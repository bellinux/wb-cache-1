5|$|The Stoics {{sought to}} <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unruly emotions, which they {{regarded}} as being contrary to nature. The passions or emotions (pathe) are the disturbing element in right judgment. Chrysippus wrote a whole book concerning the therapy of the emotions. The passions are like diseases which depress and crush the soul, thus {{he sought to}} eradicate them (apatheia). Wrong judgements turn into passions when they gather an impetus of their own, just as, when one has started running, {{it is difficult to}} stop. One cannot hope to eradicate the emotions when one is in the heat of love or anger: this can only be done when one is calm. Therefore, one should prepare in advance, and deal with the emotions in the mind as if they were present. By applying reason to emotions such as greed, pride, or lust, one can understand the harm which they cause.|$|E

5|$|Dallas {{was born}} Constance Hopkins Snow on April 28, 1902, in Brooklyn Heights, New York, the {{daughter}} of Henry Sanger Snow and Anna LeConte Brooks. Henry Snow was a lawyer who worked as the treasurer of the New York & New Jersey Telephone Сompany. Brooks was originally from Philadelphia, {{the daughter of}} inventor David Brooks, and had {{served as president of}} the Daughters of the American Revolution. Constance was the youngest of the Snow children, born when her mother was forty-seven years old. She had three older siblings: Marion, Edward, and Anna. After Henry Snow was indicted for grand larceny concerning his former employers in 1908, he fled the city, leaving his family destitute. With some financial assistance from Andrew Carnegie, a friend of David Brooks, the family moved to Europe, where accommodations were cheaper and the family could <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stigma of Henry's crimes. While there, Constance was educated in convent schools in Belgium. When the family returned to the United States, they settled in Philadelphia and Snow attended Germantown Friends School. She later studied nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, and she served in the Cadet Nurse Corps during World War II.|$|E
5|$|The novel's protagonist is Lucius, {{a man who}} {{has been}} magically {{transformed}} into a donkey. In the eleventh and last book of the novel, Lucius, after falling asleep on the beach at Cenchreae in Greece, wakes to see the full moon. He prays to the moon, using the names of several moon goddesses known in the Greco-Roman world, asking her to restore him to human form. Isis appears in a vision before Lucius and declares herself the greatest of all goddesses. She tells him that a festival in her honor, the Navigium Isidis, is taking place nearby, and that the festival procession carries with it garlands of roses that will restore his human form if he eats them. After Lucius becomes human again, the high priest at the festival declares that he has been saved from his misfortunes by the goddess, and that he will now <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inquisitiveness and self-indulgence that drew him into many of his earlier misadventures. Lucius joins the local temple of Isis, becomes her devoted follower, and eventually undergoes initiation.|$|E
25|$|Preimplantation genetic {{diagnosis}} (PGD or PIGD) refers to genetic profiling of embryos prior to implantation (as {{a form of}} embryo profiling), and sometimes even of oocytes prior to fertilization.

The baby's supply of immunologically compatible cord blood was saved for transplantation to his brother. The transplantation was considered successful.

The effects of the war were to reaffirm Persia's ability to interfere successfully in Greek politics and to affirm Sparta's weakened hegemonic position in the Greek political system. Sparta entered its long-term decline after a severe military defeat to Epaminondas of Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra.

25|$|Pre-implantation genetic {{diagnosis}} (PGD or PIGD) {{refers to the}} genetic profiling of embryos prior to implantation (as a form of embryo profiling), and sometimes even of oocytes prior to fertilization.

The establishment of a rival market at Deritend in the neighbouring parish of Aston had led them to acquire the hamlet by 1270, and the family is recorded enforcing the payment of tolls by traders from King's Norton, Bromsgrove, Wednesbury, and Tipton in 1263, 1308 and 1403. In 1250 William de Birmingham gained permission to hold a fair for three days about Ascensiontide.

25|$|In June 1846, Frémont and Carson both {{participated in}} a California {{uprising}} against Mexico called the Bear Flag Revolt. Mexico ordered all Americans to leave California.

He and his men were able to give some protection to the Americans. He ordered Carson to execute an old Mexican man named Jose De La Reyes Berryessa and his two adult nephews. These three were captured when they stepped ashore at San Francisco Bay. They were executed to keep them from taking reports to Mexico about the uprising.|$|E

25|$|Using matrix matched {{calibration}} standards can compensate for ion suppression. Using this technique, {{calibration standards}} are prepared in identical sample matrix {{to that used}} for analysis (e.g. plasma) by spiking a normal sample with known concentrations of analyte. This is not always possible for biological samples, since the analyte of interest is often endogenously present in a clinically significant, albeit normal, quantity. For matrix matched calibration standards {{to be effective in}} compensating for ion suppression, the sample matrix must <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analyte of interest. Additionally, it is important that there is little variation in test sample composition since both the test sample and the prepared calibration sample must be affected in the same way by ion suppression. Again, in complex biological samples from different individuals, or even the same individual at a different time, there may be large fluctuations in the concentrations of ion suppressing species.|$|E

Richard is gravely injured from an enemy's arrow. He is brought to Nicci, a sorceress and former Sister of the Dark, who heals him using Subtractive Magic; this causes unforeseen events to spiral out of control. When Richard awakens, he discovers that his wife, Kahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor, is missing. Furthermore, no one around him seems to remember her. Nicci and Cara both attribute Richard's memory of Kahlan to dreams and delusions brought on by his injury and possibly an unintended effect of the Subtractive Magic used in healing Richard. Despite Richard's attempts to explain {{the events of the last}} several years could not have happened without Kahlan, the paradoxes are explained away as Richard remembering things inaccurately.|$|E
25|$|On 14 September, Philip took {{advantage}} of the rumors and inquiry to begin his move against the Templars, sending out a secret order to his agents in all parts of France to implement a mass arrest of all Templars at dawn on 13 October.

Molay was in Paris on 12 October, where he was a pallbearer at the funeral of Catherine of Courtenay, wife of Count Charles of Valois, and sister-in-law of King Philip. In a dawn raid on Friday, 13 October 1307, Molay and sixty of his Templar brother knights were arrested. Philip then had the Templars charged with heresy and many other trumped-up charges, most of which were identical to the charges which had previously been leveled by Philip's agents against Pope Boniface VIII.|$|E
