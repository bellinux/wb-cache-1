Presently he found a large butcher's knife, with which they cut up the carcasses; and with this he set to work to dig {{a hole in the}} ground, close to the wall of the hut. The <b>bottom</b> <b>log</b> was only sunk a few inches in the soil, and in two hours he had burrowed under it, and made his way out beyond; then he crept back again, scraped the earth into the hole again as tightly as he could, {{crawling}} out backwards. He then placed a piece of turf over the outside hole, and stamped it down flat.|$|E
6000|$|AS {{soon as we}} {{reckoned}} {{everybody was}} asleep that night we went down the lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our pile of fox-fire, and went to work. We cleared everything out of the way, {{about four or five}} foot along the middle of the <b>bottom</b> <b>log.</b> Tom said he was right behind Jim's bed now, and we'd dig in under it, and when we got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there, because Jim's counter-pin hung down most to the ground, and you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole. So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't see we'd done anything hardly. At last I says: ...|$|E

60|$|He rose quickly, but silently, alert, self-contained, and menacing. For this dreamer, this {{bereaved}} man, this scornful philosopher {{of riches}} had disappeared with that midnight trespass upon the sacred treasure. The {{movement of the}} blanket ceased; the soft, swishing sound recommenced. He drew a glittering bowie-knife from his boot-leg, and in three noiseless strides was beside the pile. There he saw what he fully expected to see,--a narrow, horizontal gap between the log walls of the cabin and the adobe floor, slowly widening and deepening by the burrowing of unseen hands from without. The cold outer air which he had felt before was now plainly flowing into the heated cabin through the opening. The swishing sound recommenced, and stopped. Then the four fingers of a hand, palm downwards, were cautiously introduced between the <b>bottom</b> <b>log</b> and the denuded floor. Upon that intruding hand the bowie-knife of Demorest descended like a flash of lightning. There was no outcry. Even in that supreme moment Demorest felt a pang of admiration for the stoicism of the unseen trespasser. But the maimed hand was quickly withdrawn, and as quickly Demorest rushed {{to the door and}} dashed into the outer darkness.|$|E
60|$|But {{by and by}} pap got too handy {{with his}} hick'ry, and I couldn't stand it. I was all over welts. He got to going away so much, too, and locking me in. Once he locked me in and was gone three days. It was dreadful lonesome. I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn't {{ever going to get}} out any more. I was scared. I made up my mind I would fix up some way to leave there. I had tried {{to get out of that}} cabin many a time, but I couldn't find no way. There warn't a window to it big enough for a dog to get through. I couldn't get up the chimbly; it was too narrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or {{anything}} in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time. But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big <b>bottom</b> <b>log</b> out--big enough to let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap's gun in the woods. I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.|$|E

50|$|An east-west running {{floor of}} random width {{tongue and groove}} oak boards occurs on the ground floor. The walls are not plastered, leaving the logs {{directly}} exposed. The cabin has undergone relatively few alterations. It has been moved at least once, perhaps twice. The first time, {{if it could be}} agreed upon (refer to Item 8), in 1840-1841 from Dresden to Altenburg—a distance of approximately one mile, in order to be closer to Pastor Loeber's parsonage; the second time in 1912 when it was transported from there a few hundred yards to where it now stands in the church grove of Trinity Lutheran Church in Altenburg. At that time, a chimney was removed and two oak beams were placed under the cabin to assist in transporting it; these remained to become the <b>bottom</b> <b>logs</b> of the cabin after it was permanently in place on the concrete foundation prepared for it in the church grove. It was also at this time that 2 by 6 in oak timbers were vertically attached to the walls to stabilize the building during the move.|$|R

50|$|Cabin corners {{were often}} set on large stones; if the cabin was large, other stones were used at other {{points along the}} sill (<b>bottom</b> <b>log).</b> Since they were usually cut into the sill, {{thresholds}} were supported with rock as well. These stones are found below the corners of many 18th-century cabins as they are restored. Cabins were set on foundations {{to keep them out}} of damp soil but also to allow for storage or basements to be constructed below the cabin. Cabins with earth floors had no need for foundations.Cabins were constructed using a variety of notches. Notches can vary within ethnic groups as well as between them. Notches often varied on a single building, so their styles were not conclusive.One method common in the Ohio River Valley in southwestern Ohio and southeastern Indiana is the Block House End Method an example of this is found in the David Brown House.|$|E
40|$|High {{levels of}} growth stress are implicated in causing end {{splitting}} of logs, deflection during sawing and deformation of boards as stresses are released during sawing operations. Level of stress {{is a function}} of strain and the elastic modulus of the wood (MOE). Levels of peripheral strain can be measured on standing trees and, if the MOE is known, stresses can be estimated. The validity of using peripheral strain measurements relies on underlying theoretical models that relate strain to expected patterns of stress distribution and levels of board deflection. This study evaluates these theoretical relationships by determining relationships of stress and strain with board deflection, end splitting and a range of wood properties. Peripheral strain levels were extremely variable within the <b>bottom</b> <b>log</b> and little evidence was found for consistent patterns of variation, although measurements generally increased with increasing height above ground. Sampling on two sides of the standing tree at breast height appeared to be a suitable strategy, with the mean for these strain readings having a correlation (r) of 0. 86 with the average strain in the <b>bottom</b> <b>log.</b> Growth strain was not a reliable predictor of board deflection and cannot be recommended as a non-destructive sampling method. Overall there was a poor relationship between growth strain and board deflection. No consistent relationships were found between a range of wood properties and growth strain or board deflection across both sites. Stress levels were calculated for each tree as the product of growth strain and modulus of elasticity and the relationship between calculated stress and mean board deflection determined. No relationship was found at either site with correlations being very close to zero. The underlying theoretical relationships between stress and strain were examined and several questions raised about the validity of such models...|$|E
40|$|Nine Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trials, {{situated}} {{north of}} latitude 6 I 0 N, were studied. The frequency of trees with straight stems {{and one or}} more spike knots was evaluated at a tree age of 27 - 29 years. A model was developed describing geographical variation and was based on 19 provenance trials {{from different parts of}} Sweden. North of latitude 6 I 0 N, an average of 30 per cent of the stems were straight enough to produce a first-class <b>bottom</b> <b>log</b> of sawtimber. In addition, 47 per cent of the trees had no spike knots up to 5 m height. Significant variation between provenances was found in stem straightness and spike knot frequency in most trials. Provenances transferred southwards were straighter and had fewer spike knots than the corresponding local provenance. The frequencies and numbers of straight stems and trees without spike knots were higher at 1. 25 m spacing than at 2. 0 m spacing. The general models for geographical variation indicate that the highest number of straight stems without spike knots may be found between latitudes 58 " and 65 "N and at altitudes below 250 m...|$|E

Lytle's 17th Brigade, was posted on a ridge on which Squire Bottom's house and barn were situated, overlooking a bend in the Chaplin River and a hill and farm owned by R. F. Chatham on the other side. At about 2:30p.m. Major John E. Austin's 14th Battalion of Louisiana Sharpshooters, screening Brig. Gen. Daniel W. Adams's Confederate brigade, engaged the 42nd Indiana as it was collecting water in the ravine of Doctor's Creek. This began a Confederate attack against this area with Brig. Gen. Bushrod R. Johnson's brigade descending from Chatham House Hill at about 2:45p.m., crossing the almost-dry riverbed and attacking the 3rd Ohio Infantry, commanded by Col. John Beatty. The attack was disorganized; last-minute changes of orders from Buckner were not distributed to all of the participating units and friendly fire from Confederate artillery broke their lines while still on Chatham House Hill. When the infantry attack eventually moved up the hill, fighting from stone wall to stone wall, Confederate artillery bombarded the 3rd Ohio and set afire Squire <b>Bottom's</b> <b>log</b> barn.

40|$|Ten {{provenance}} trials {{located between}} latitude 55 o 37 ' and 60 o 32 ' were studied.

Environmental differences also had a major effect on Scots pine quality. The southern. tallest. provenances were less straight than northern ones. On the contrary. within each provenance the tall trees were also straighter and had less spike knots than short trees. Spacing effects showed that the number of trees suitable for first class saw timber were approximately 50 per cent higher in the 1. 25 m spacing than in the 2. 0 m spacing. The joint effect of provenance transfer and spacing on stem straightness. indicated that with the same minimum requirements. a change in spacing from 2. 0 m to 1. 25 m. corresponded to the effect of a southward provenance transfer of 2 o of latitude...|$|E
40|$|Large-eddy {{simulation}} (LES) of {{wind and}} wave forced oceanic turbulent boundary layers is performed using the residual-based variational multiscale method (RBVMS) and near-wall modeling. Wind and surface gravity wave forcing generates Langmuir turbulence characterized by Langmuir circulation (LC) with largest scales consisting of streamwise vortices aligned {{in the direction of}} the wind, acting as a secondary flow structure to the primary wind-driven component of the flow. The LES here is representative of a shallow water continental shelf flow (10 to 30 meters in depth) far from lateral boundaries in which LC engulfs the full depth of the water column and disrupts the <b>bottom</b> <b>log</b> layer. Field measurements indicate that occurrence of full-depth LC is typical during the passage of storms. The RBVMS method with quadratic NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-splines) with near-wall resolution is shown to possess good convergence characteristics for this flow. The use of near-wall modeling facilitates simulations with expanded domains over horizontal directions. Thus, these simulations are able to resolve multiple Langmuir cells permitting analysis of the interaction between the cells. Results in terms of velocity statistics are presented from simulations performed with various domain sizes and distinct near-wall treatments: (1) the classical treatment based on prescription of the wall shear stress assuming a law of the wall and (2) a recent treatment based on weak imposition of the no-slip bottom boundary condition...|$|E

40|$|Several {{properties}} of wood {{are affected by}} moisture content-weight, fuel value, electrical conductivity, strength, and shrinkage. Differences in these properties are commonly observed in wood in service. For example, a green 2 X 4 weighs more than a kiln-dried 2 X 4, dried wood burns more easily and hotter than green wood, etc. Furthermore, {{research has shown that}} moisture content varies within the tree (pith to bark and stem to crown) and seasonally in aspen and paper birch. (Northern conifers do not seem to vary much seasonally.) Knowing these types of variations could be important if you routinely buy and sell wood by weight. In paper birch and trembling aspen, water content is highest in the spring just before bud break; it decreases during the summer until leaf fall, and after that increases until December (see graph). During January there is a small decrease {{but not as much as}} during summer. Most variations in moisture content were observed in the wood nearest the bark. In aspen, moisture content also generally decreases with height. In general, the weight of a load of summer-cut (June-July) birch and aspen can be estimated by assuming that half the weight is water. Wood cut in January or February has more moisture and could be 6 or more percent heavier than the same volume cut in summer. Moisture content will vary from year to year so you should calculate it for individual cases if you wish to be precise. In addition, if you want to compare the weights of winter-cut and summer-cut wood, the samples should include equal proportions of top, middle, and <b>bottom</b> <b>logs</b> because of moisture content variations within the tree...|$|R
