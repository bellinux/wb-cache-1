[...] A knife is used to alter carefully the clothing and armour sculpted onto to the miniature, or to shave off other features. [...] The surface is then smoothed, and what was once armour can be painted as cloth to complete the conversion. Some items such as <b>belts,</b> <b>bandoliers</b> <b>and</b> straps can be shaven off without much difficulty, in order to achieve a different troop type.|$|R

50|$|Throughout the novel, Mailer dwells on many themes which {{reappear}} in {{his later}} essays and novels. One of these themes is the dehumanization of soldiers. The soldiers are continuously referred to as machines within the novel. At one point, Mailer describes this dehumanization stating, “When a man was harnessed into a pack <b>and</b> web <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> carried a rifle <b>and</b> two <b>bandoliers</b> <b>and</b> several grenades, a bayonet and a helmet, {{he felt as if}} he had a tourniquet over both shoulders and across his chest. It was hard to breathe and his limbs kept falling asleep.” Thus, in this instance, the soldier is losing grasp of his bodily functions and simply going through the motions of being a “soldier”.|$|R

50|$|On 14 December 1972, he and Detective Sergeant Myles Hawkshaw {{were members}} of a party {{to carry out a}} search for {{firearms}} at a farm near Dundalk. They encountered four men, three of whom ran off; however, the fourth, armed <b>and</b> wearing <b>bandoliers,</b> aimed at the unarmed Guards. Walsh and Hawkshaw wrestled him to the ground; the gun was found to be fully loaded and ready to fire. A search uncovered three rifles <b>and</b> two <b>bandoliers</b> in a shed.|$|R
50|$|The first type of {{headgear}} was a German-style peaked cap, {{but this}} was soon replaced by the older French-style kepi but now in khaki wool and leather chinstrap, adorned with branch-pipings and an embroidered Greek royal cockade. In periods of mobilization older stocks continued being used for auxiliary units, mainly older caps and items of black leather. Minor variations of the 1908 uniform and equipment were issued to specialist units, e.g. breeches, high-boots <b>and</b> <b>bandoliers</b> to cavalry troopers.|$|R
60|$|This they {{repeated}} in the morning, so as to familiarize them {{with the sound of}} firearms; then they saddled and mounted them, and after riding for half an hour drew up in line, as Captain Brookfield, who had sworn them in on the previous afternoon, was to inspect them at eight o'clock. They had all put on their working clothes, <b>bandoliers</b> <b>and</b> <b>belts,</b> <b>and</b> high boots, and the captain on his arrival, after closely inspecting them, expressed his strongest approval of their appearance.|$|R

60|$|All {{were soon}} hard at work. The Kaffirs stirred up the embers of the fire, {{which they had}} {{replenished}} {{two or three times}} during the night, hung the kettles again over it, and cut up slices of ham ready to fry. By half-past five Chris, after inspecting all the horses closely, declared that nothing more could be done to them. Then they were saddled, the valises, with a day's provisions and a spare blanket, being strapped on. Then all had a wash, and made themselves, as far as possible, tidy. By this time breakfast was ready, and they had just finished their meal when a party of horsemen were seen in the distance. Rifles were slung over their shoulders, <b>and</b> <b>bandoliers</b> <b>and</b> <b>belts</b> full of cartridges strapped on, and they donned their forage-caps after coiling up the picket-ropes and halters and fastening them with their valises to the saddles. Then they mounted and formed up in line just as the general, with two of his staff, rode up. After saying a few words to Chris, the general examined the horses and their riders closely.|$|R
60|$|Then, paying no {{attention}} to the curses and threats of the Boers, the party rode forward and collected the Boer guns, emptied the <b>bandoliers</b> <b>and</b> <b>belts,</b> <b>and</b> then rode back to the cattle and released the four Boers with them, and, pointing to their comrades, told them to rejoin them. Then they collected the cattle, and, driving them before them, rode off. When they had gone five miles away they halted, and the farmers undertaking to keep watch by turns, the lads, throwing themselves down, were in a few minutes fast asleep.|$|R
25|$|In 1967, {{the company}} {{introduced}} a cartoon spokesman, the Frito Bandito, {{which became the}} subject of criticism from Mexican-American groups, who expressed concerns that it portrayed a Mexican stereotype. The Frito Bandito (voiced by Mel Blanc) wore a sombrero <b>and</b> <b>bandoliers,</b> had a handlebar moustache, and brandished pistols. Protests from advocacy groups such as The National Mexican-American Anti-Defamation Committee (NMAADC) prompted some initial concessions, such as the removal of the pistols and a thinning of the accent. The Frito Bandito was replaced in 1970 by The Muncha Bunch, and then again by a new cartoon called W.C. Fritos (based on W. C. Fields).|$|R
60|$|The neck {{between the}} hills {{was lined with}} trenches. The South Lancashire Regiment had halted, pinned to the ground by the Boer fire. Were they {{going to lose the}} day for us when it was already won? The {{question}} was soon answered. In an instant there appeared on the left of the Boer trench a dozen--only a dozen--violent forms rushing forward. A small party had worked their way to the flank, and were at close quarters with cold steel. And then--by contrast to their former courage--the valiant burghers fled in all directions, and others held out their rifles <b>and</b> <b>bandoliers</b> <b>and</b> begged for mercy, which was sometimes generously given, so that by the time the whole attack had charged forward into the trenches there was a nice string of thirty-two prisoners winding down the hill: at which token of certain victory we shouted loudly.|$|R

It is also known that some Pilgrims loaded trade goods on board, including Isaac Allerton, William Mullins, and possibly others; these also most likely were stored in the cargo hold.|$|R
25|$|On {{the morning}} of Monday 24 April, about 1,200 members of the Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army mustered at several {{locations}} in central Dublin. Among them {{were members of the}} all-female Cumann na mBan. Some wore Irish Volunteer and Citizen Army uniforms, while others wore civilian clothes with a yellow Irish Volunteer armband, military hats, <b>and</b> <b>bandoliers.</b> They were armed mostly with rifles (especially 1871 Mausers), but also with shotguns, revolvers, a few Mauser C96 semi-automatic pistols, and grenades. The number of Volunteers who mobilised was much smaller than expected. This was due to MacNeill's countermanding order, {{and the fact that the}} new orders had been sent so soon beforehand. However, several hundred Volunteers joined the Rising after it began.|$|R
60|$|Whilst we {{had been}} making our dispositions the troop of horse--for there {{appeared}} to be but one--had trotted down the cross-road, and had drawn up across the main highway. They numbered, as far as I could judge, about ninety troopers, and it was evident from their three-cornered hats, steel plates, red sleeves, <b>and</b> <b>bandoliers,</b> that they were dragoons of the regular army. The main body halted {{a quarter of a mile}} from us, while three officers rode to the front and held a short consultation, which ended in one of them setting spurs to his horse and cantering down in our direction. A bugler followed a few paces behind him, waving a white kerchief and blowing an occasional blast upon his trumpet.|$|R

The strategy underlines China's push to take a larger role in global affairs, and the desire to coordinate manufacturing capacity with other countries in areas such as steel manufacturing. It was unveiled in September and October 2013 in announcements revealing the SREB and MSR, respectively. It was also promoted by Premier Li Keqiang during the state visit to Asia and Europe. It was the most frequently mentioned concept in the People's Daily in 2016. The initiative in the initial days was also called One <b>Belt</b> <b>and</b> One Road in English, but in mid-2016, the official English name was changed to the <b>Belt</b> <b>and</b> Road Initiative due to misinterpretation of the one in the name.|$|R
5000|$|Multiplayer {{gameplay}} is class based, {{with six}} classes available. The Commando {{is the standard}} grunt class, with an assault rifle; the Sharpshooter specializes in long range with conventional sniper rifles; the Guerrilla excels in close combat and ambush with shotguns; the Rebel uses explosives and fire with flamethrowers and rocket launchers; the Gunner provides heavy firepower with light machine guns and rocket launchers; and the Saboteur uses stealth and silenced weapons [...] Each class can choose an appropriate primary weapon and a side arm, as well as explosives such as frag grenades or Molotov cocktails. Players are able to unlock more powerful weapons within each class by spending up to three [...] "blood diamonds" [...] on a class; the diamonds are earned through the experience points from killing other players and completing objectives.
