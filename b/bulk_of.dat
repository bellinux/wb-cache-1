5|$|Hugh married Margaret, one of {{the daughters}} and heiresses of William de Chesney, the founder of Sibton Abbey. Margaret {{was one of three}} daughters, but she {{inherited}} the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> her father's estates. Although Margaret was the eldest daughter, the reason she received the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the estates was King Henry's desire to reward Hugh, as the king arranged the marriage as well as ensuring that most of her father's lands went to her. Through Margaret, Hugh gained the barony of Blythburgh in Suffolk, which he had control of by 1174. He also acquired lands at Rottingdean in Sussex from Margaret.|$|E

50|$|In the {{reaction}} mechanism proposed by Takai, chromium(II) is oxidized to chromium(III) when replacing both halogen atoms. The geminal carbodianion complex thus formed reacts with the aldehyde in a 1,2-addition {{along one of}} the carbon to chromium bonds {{and in the next}} step both chromium bearing groups engage in an elimination reaction. In newman projection it can be seen how the steric <b>bulks</b> <b>of</b> chromium groups and the steric <b>bulks</b> <b>of</b> the alkyl and halogen groups drive this reaction towards anti elimination.|$|R

40|$|Despite its {{importance}} to mine planning, very few coal mine operators routinely and accurately measure the net <b>bulking</b> <b>of</b> spoil from their mines. With increasing environmental restrictions and space constraints being imposed on mine sites, {{a better understanding}} <b>of</b> the net <b>bulking</b> <b>of</b> spoil is important, as it affects volume storage requirements both in-pit and, more importantly, out-of-pit. Laboratory compression tests have been undertaken on scalped (to a given maximum size to allow testing) spoil specimens to estimate the self-weight and collapse settlement of coal mine spoil. Degradation testing {{was carried out by}} exposing scalped soil to the weather and monitoring its degradation and settlement. The results of these tests were used as input into a predictive tool for estimating the net <b>bulking</b> <b>of</b> coal mine spoil. This paper focuses on the laboratory testing program of two spoil types, representing the range from uncemented to cemented coal mine spoil, and presents an estimate <b>of</b> their net <b>bulking</b> based on the predictive tool...|$|R
