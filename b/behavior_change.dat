25|$|According to the transtheoretical {{model of}} <b>behavior</b> <b>change,</b> {{also known as}} the stages of change model, states that there are five stages towards <b>behavior</b> <b>change.</b> The five stages, between which {{individuals}} may transition before achieving complete change, are precontemplation, contemplation, preparation for action, action, and maintenance. At the precontemplation stage, an individual {{may or may not be}} aware of a problem but has no thought of changing their behavior. From precontemplation to contemplation, the individual begins thinking about changing a certain behavior. During preparation, the individual begins his plans for change, and during the action stage the individual begins to exhibit new behavior consistently. An individual finally enters the maintenance stage once they exhibit the new behavior consistently for over six months. A problem faced with the stages of change model is that it is very easy for a person to enter the maintenance stage and then fall back into earlier stages. Factors that contribute to this decline include external factors such as weather or seasonal changes, and/or personal issues a person is dealing with.|$|E

As an {{approach}} to psychotherapy, NLP shares similar core assumptions and foundations in common with some contemporary brief and systemic practices, such as solution focused brief therapy. NLP has also been acknowledged as having influenced these practices with its reframing techniques which seeks to achieve <b>behavior</b> <b>change</b> by shifting its context or meaning, for example, by finding the positive connotation of a thought or behavior.|$|E
25|$|Reinforcement is the {{key element}} in operant {{conditioning}} and in most <b>behavior</b> <b>change</b> programs. It is {{the process by which}} behavior is strengthened. If a behavior is followed closely in time by a stimulus and this results in an increase in the future frequency of that behavior, then the stimulus is a positive reinforcer. If the removal of an event serves as a reinforcer, this is termed negative reinforcement. There are multiple schedules of reinforcement that affect the future probability of behavior.|$|E
25|$|By {{understanding}} {{psychological factors}} that influence health, and constructively applying that knowledge, health psychologists can improve health by working directly with individual patients or indirectly in large-scale public health programs. In addition, health psychologists can help train other healthcare professionals (e.g., physicians and nurses) {{to take advantage of}} the knowledge the discipline has generated, when treating patients. Health psychologists work in a variety of settings: alongside other medical professionals in hospitals and clinics, in public health departments working on large-scale <b>behavior</b> <b>change</b> and health promotion programs, and in universities and medical schools where they teach and conduct research.|$|E

25|$|The {{promotion}} and advocacy of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise {{awareness about the}} benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term <b>behavior</b> <b>change</b> of the population. For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary. One example for handwashing promotion in schools is the “Three Star Approach” by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements. When minimum standards are achieved, schools can move from one to ultimately three stars. Building hand washing stations can be a part of handwashing promotion campaigns that are carried out in order to reduce diseases and child mortality.|$|E
25|$|Social-cognitive {{models of}} <b>behavior</b> <b>change</b> include the {{constructs}} of motivation and volition. Motivation {{is seen as}} a process that leads to the forming of behavioral intentions. Volition {{is seen as a}} process that leads from intention to actual behavior. In other words, motivation and volition refer to goal setting and goal pursuit, respectively. Both processes require self-regulatory efforts. Several self-regulatory constructs are needed to operate in orchestration to attain goals. An example of such a motivational and volitional construct is perceived self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is supposed to facilitate the forming of behavioral intentions, the development of action plans, and the initiation of action. It can support the translation of intentions into action.|$|E
40|$|Although {{numerous}} studies have documented <b>changes</b> in the <b>behavior</b> of nonhuman primate females {{around the time of}} ovulation, very little atten-tion has been paid to <b>behavior</b> <b>changes</b> around the time of menstruation. Yet such information is obviously relevant to understanding the origins and etiology of the adverse mood and <b>behavior</b> <b>changes</b> experienced premen-strually by many women. Analysis of data obtained during 115 hours of observation on 13 female Amboseli (Kenya) baboons (Papw cynocephalus) during 24 menstrual periods showed that prior to and during the time of menstrual onset, these individuals exhibited distinct changes in their activ-ity budgets, nearest-neighbor distances, and patterns of social interaction. Furthermore, in comparison to females around the time of ovulation, peri-menstrual females showed increased rates of agonistic interaction and de-creased (but nonzero) rates of sexual interaction with adult males. These premenstrual and perimenstrual <b>behavior</b> <b>changes</b> among female yellow baboons thus show some intriguing similarities to several commonly re-ported behavioral symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in women...|$|R
40|$|Anecdotal and {{qualitative}} {{evidence suggests that}} women may 				experience disrupted adjustment during the months following the 				end of adjuvant breast cancer treatment, {{in part due to}} the loss 				of a 2 ̆ 2 safety net 2 ̆ 2 associated with regular treatment coupled with 				uncertainty regarding cancer status. The present study examined 				distress and quality of life, as well as behavioral and 				cognitive predictors of adjustment, during the three months 				following adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. Participants 				were 89 women with breast cancer who completed measures of 				distress, quality of life, health <b>behavior,</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>changes,</b> 				and common-sense beliefs about cancer at three time points: 				toward the end of adjuvant treatment, 3 weeks following the end 				of treatment, and 3 months post-treatment. Findings indicated 				that breast cancer survivors were remarkably well-adjusted 				following treatment: participants reported low levels of anxiety 				and depression and good health-related quality of life. 				Nonetheless, women acknowledged significant concerns about 				ongoing physical symptoms, potential recurrence, and the process 				of returning to or building a 2 ̆ 2 new normal. 2 ̆ 2 Results further 				suggested that <b>behavior</b> <b>changes</b> were quite common after the end 				of treatment, particularly positive changes in health practices. 				Although good health practices were associated with better 				adjustment, making positive changes in the same behaviors often 				predicted greater distress. Women 2 ̆ 7 s common-sense beliefs about 				breast cancer provided insight into whether women decided to 				make <b>behavior</b> <b>changes</b> and what <b>behaviors</b> they decided to change. 				Women who perceived greater control over their cancer, saw their 				cancer as an acute rather than chronic condition, and attributed 				cancer to controllable causes or believed that behavioral or 				psychological factors could prevent recurrence were more likely 				to make <b>behavior</b> <b>changes</b> and engage in positive health 				practices. Although it was predicted that beliefs and <b>behavior</b> 				<b>changes</b> would interact to predict distress, no consistent 				pattern of interactions was found. In sum, breast cancer 				patients actively attempt to create a 2 ̆ 2 new normal 2 ̆ 2 following 				treatment, and changes in health practices appear to be an 				important part of this process.

25|$|Pit latrines {{may or may}} not be {{an enjoyable}} {{experience}} to use. Problems may occur when the pit latrine is shared by too many people, is not cleaned daily and not emptied when the pit is full. In such cases, flies and odour can be a massive nuisance. Also, pit latrines are usually dark places which are difficult to keep clean. Often, handwashing facilities are missing. For these reasons, shared pit latrines can be quite uncomfortable to use in developing countries. Also, there might be cultural preferences for open defecation and these may be difficult to overcome with unattractive toilet designs.
