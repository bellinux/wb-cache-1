Her studio's garden became a local attraction and she hosted teas for which she made homemade candy.

25|$|<b>Block</b> <b>printing,</b> called tarsh in Arabic, {{developed}} in Arabic Egypt during the ninth and tenth centuries, mostly for prayers and amulets. There {{is some evidence}} to suggest that these print blocks made from non-wood materials, possibly tin, lead, or clay. The techniques employed are uncertain, however, and they appear to have had very little influence outside of the Muslim world. Though Europe adopted woodblock printing from the Muslim world, initially for fabric, the technique of metal <b>block</b> <b>printing</b> remained unknown in Europe. <b>Block</b> <b>printing</b> later went out of use in Islamic Central Asia after movable type printing was introduced from China.|$|E

25|$|Printing {{began in}} Tang Dynasty China. A {{copy of the}} Diamond Sutra, a key Buddhist text, found sealed in a cave in China in the early 20th century, is the oldest known dated printed book, with a printed date of 868. The method used was <b>block</b> <b>printing.</b>|$|E

The names of these styles come from the Song and Ming dynasties, when <b>block</b> <b>printing</b> flourished in China.|$|E
25|$|Making duplications of Buddhist texts was {{considered}} to bring meritorious karma. Printing from individually carved wooden blocks and from clay or metal movable type proved much more efficient than hand copying and eventually eclipsed it. The Diamond Sūtra (Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra) of 868 CE, a Buddhist scripture discovered in 1907 inside the Mogao Caves, is the first dated example of <b>block</b> <b>printing.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Block</b> <b>{{printing}}</b> {{first came}} to Europe as a method for printing on cloth, where it was common by 1300. Images printed on cloth for religious purposes could be quite large and elaborate. When paper became relatively easily available, around 1400, the medium transferred very quickly to small woodcut religious images and playing cards printed on paper. These prints produced in very large numbers from about 1425 onward.|$|E

25|$|In Asia, {{the spread}} of Buddhism led to {{large-scale}} ongoing translation efforts spanning well over a thousand years. The Tangut Empire was especially efficient in such efforts; exploiting the then newly invented <b>block</b> <b>printing,</b> and with {{the full support of}} the government (contemporary sources describe the Emperor and his mother personally contributing to the translation effort, alongside sages of various nationalities), the Tanguts took mere decades to translate volumes that had taken the Chinese centuries to render.|$|E

25|$|A {{printing}} press is a mechanical device for applying pressure to an inked surface resting upon a medium (such as paper or cloth), thereby transferring an image. The systems involved were first assembled in Germany by the goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century. Printing methods based on Gutenberg's {{printing press}} spread rapidly throughout first Europe {{and then the}} rest of the world, replacing most <b>block</b> <b>printing</b> and making it the sole progenitor of modern movable type printing. As a method of creating reproductions for mass consumption, The printing press has been superseded by the advent of offset printing.|$|E

25|$|The {{advantages}} {{possessed by}} roller printing over all other processes are mainly three: firstly, its high productivity, 10,000 to 12,000 yards being commonly printed {{in one day}} of ten hours by a single-colour machine; secondly, by its capacity of being applied to the reproduction of every style of design, ranging from the fine delicate lines of copperplate engraving and the small repeats and limited colours of the perrotine to the broadest effects of <b>block</b> <b>printing</b> and to patterns varying in repeat from I to 80 in.; and thirdly, the wonderful exactitude with which each portion of an elaborate multicolour pattern can be fitted into its proper place, and the entire absence of faulty joints at its points of repeat or repetition consideration {{of the utmost importance}} in fine delicate work, where such a blur would utterly destroy the effect.|$|E
500|$|The Ming dynasty {{had seen}} {{considerable}} advancement {{in the process}} of colour printing in China. At his studio, Hu Zhengyan experimented with various forms of woodblock printing, creating processes for producing multi-coloured prints and embossed printed designs. As a result, he was able to produce some of China's first printed publications in colour, using a <b>block</b> <b>printing</b> technique known as [...] "assorted block printing" [...] (douban yinshua, [...] ). This system made use of multiple blocks, each carved with {{a different part of the}} final image and each bearing a different colour. It was a lengthy, painstaking process, requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy inkings and impressions to create a single image. Hu also employed a related form of multiple-block printing called [...] "set-block printing" [...] (taoban yinshua, [...] ), which had existed since the Yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again. He refined these <b>block</b> <b>printing</b> techniques by developing a process for wiping some of the ink off the blocks before printing; this enabled him to achieve gradation and modulation of shades which were not previously possible.|$|E
2500|$|Movable type {{printing}} was hardly {{used for the}} first 300 years after its invention by Bi Sheng. Even in Korea where metal movable type was most widespread, it still never replaced woodblock printing. Indeed, even the promulgation of Hangeul was done through woodblock prints. The general assumption is that movable type did not replace <b>block</b> <b>printing</b> in places that used Chinese characters due to the expense of producing more than 200,000 individual pieces of type. Even woodblock printing was not as cost productive as simply paying a copyist to write out a book by hand. Although Sejong the Great introduced Hangeul, an alphabetic system, in the 15th century, Hangeul only replaced Hanja in the 20th century. And unlike China, the movable type system was kept mainly {{within the confines of}} a highly stratified elite Korean society: ...|$|E
