Abstract Failures in the sealing of {{the tooth}} apex have been {{considered}} {{to be responsible for}} most of the failures of apical surgeries. The Er:YAG laser has been proposed as an alternative for the use of rotator instruments in surgical endodontics due to its precision, lack of vibration, less postoperative discomfort, bacterial reduction, and less stress for patients and professionals. Following approval by the ethics committee, 12 extracted human canines without previous endodontic treatment with anatomically normal roots and free from apical lesions were washed in running tap water and disinfected. The teeth were sectioned axially at the crown-root junction and submitted to routine endodontic treatment. The apical limit was set at 1 mm before the apical foramen. The root canals were routinely filled with Gutta-Percha points and Sealer 26 and were randomly distributed into two groups (n= 6). In group I, apicectomy was performed with the Er:YAG laser (KAVO KEY Laser II®, Germany, = 2. 940 nm, pulsed mode, 2051 tip, with air spray cooling, 250 mJ/ 15 Hz). Apical cut was performed of perpendicular mode 3 mm from the apical foramen. In group II, the same procedures and the same sequence as above was used, varying only the parameters of the Er:YAG laser (400 mJ/ 6 Hz). Sealing of the cervical end the apex was carried out with acrylic resin; the roots were covered by a layer of epoxy glue and two layers of nail polish. The specimens were divided into groups and fixed, by the cervical third, on wax. Impermeabilization of the residual root apical third was performed following the same procedures used in the cervical third but the residual apex was left free from the impermeabilization. After that, the roots were immersed in a 2 % methylene blue solution and placed in a <b>bacteriological</b> <b>oven</b> for 48 h and then washed in running tap water for 2 h. The samples were sagittally split into two parts. The segments were visually observed and the one showing the greatest level of dye leakage was selected and kept in an individual container and coded accordingly. Apical staining was measured using a stereoscopic magnifying glass, a compass, and a caliper. The measurement was performed by three endodontists,previously calibrated, and unaware of the sample coding. The results showed that group I showed the greatest level of dye leakage. There was a significantly difference between the groups (p= 0. 001). It is concluded that the apicectomies carried out with 400 mJ/ 6 Hz showed the smallest infiltration value...|$|E
