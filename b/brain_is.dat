5|$|The <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> {{protected}} by the skull, suspended in cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier. However, the <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> still susceptible to damage, disease, and infection. Damage {{can be caused by}} trauma, or a loss of blood supply known as a stroke. The <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> susceptible to degenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, dementias including Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia and clinical depression, are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions. The brain can also be the site of tumours, both benign and malignant; these mostly originate from other sites in the body.|$|E
5|$|The human <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> {{primarily}} {{composed of}} neurons, glial cells, neural stem cells, and blood vessels. Types of neuron include interneurons, pyramidal cells including Betz cells, motor neurons (upper and lower motor neurons), and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Betz cells {{are the largest}} cells (by size of cell body) in the nervous system. The adult human <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> estimated to contain 86±8 billion neurons, with a roughly equal number (85±10 billion) of non-neuronal cells. Out of these neurons, 16 billion (19%) {{are located in the}} cerebral cortex, and 69 billion (80%) are in the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|The living <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> very soft, {{having a}} gel-like {{consistency}} similar to soft tofu. The cortical layers of neurons constitute {{much of the}} brain's grey matter, while the deeper subcortical regions of myelinated axons, make up the white matter.|$|E
30|$|One {{day after}} the drug-induced {{rotational}} test, rats were anesthetized with an overdose of pentobarbital (90 mg/kg, i.p., Mebunat, Orion Oyj, Espoo, Finland). Rat <b>brains</b> <b>were</b> fixed by intracardial perfusion with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The <b>brains</b> <b>were</b> then removed and post-fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde overnight. The rat <b>brains</b> <b>were</b> stored in 20 % sucrose at 4 °C until freezing, and frozen <b>brains</b> <b>were</b> cut on a microtome into 40 -μm sections in series of six.|$|R
40|$|A quicker {{alternative}} to the standard removal and fixation of <b>brain</b> tissue <b>was</b> sought. Whole fetal <b>brains</b> <b>were</b> fixed in situ using a mercuric based fixative. The subarachnoid space was perfused overnight with Heidenhain's Susa fixative. The following day the <b>brains</b> <b>were</b> removed from the cranium in the standard manner. After storage for three days in Susa's fixative the <b>brain</b> <b>was</b> sliced and processed, with excellent preservation of gross and microscopic architecture. The cost is only marginally {{higher than that of}} commercial formalin...|$|R

5|$|Buoyancy: The actual mass of {{the human}} <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> about 1400–1500 grams; however, the net weight of the brain {{suspended}} in the CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25-50 grams. The brain therefore exists in neutral buoyancy, which allows the brain to maintain its density without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill neurons in the lower sections without CSF.|$|E
5|$|Each {{attempt to}} answer the mind–body problem {{encounters}} substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion. These philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers {{in the tradition of}} linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory. They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts. This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.|$|E

5|$|Lack of CSF {{pressure}} and volume can allow {{the brain to}} sag and descend through the foramen magnum (large opening) of the occipital bone, {{at the base of}} the skull. The lower portion of the <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> believed to stretch or impact one or more cranial nerve complexes, thereby causing a variety of sensory symptoms.

5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{is a type}} {{of metal}} poisoning caused by lead in the body. The <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> the most sensitive. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, inability to have children, and tingling in the hands and feet. It causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems. Some of the effects are permanent. In severe cases anemia, seizures, coma, or death may occur.|$|E
5|$|Other animals, {{including}} {{whales and}} elephants have larger brains than humans. However, when the brain-to-body mass ratio is taken into account, the human <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> {{almost twice as}} large as that of a bottlenose dolphin, and three times as large as that of a chimpanzee. However, a high ratio does not of itself demonstrate intelligence: very small animals have high ratios and the treeshrew has the largest quotient of any mammal.|$|E

Precocial animals' <b>brains</b> <b>are</b> large at birth {{relative to their}} body size, hence their ability to fend for themselves. However, as adults, their <b>brains</b> <b>are</b> not much bigger or more able. Altricial animals' <b>brains</b> <b>are</b> relatively small at birth, thus their need for care and protection, but their brains continue to grow. As adults, altricial animals end up with comparatively larger brains than their precocial counterparts. Thus the altricial species have a wider skill set at maturity.|$|R

5|$|Several {{complications}} {{can occur}} {{as a result of}} SCSFLS including decreased cranial pressure, brain herniation, infection, blood pressure problems, transient paralysis, and coma. The primary and most serious complication of SCSFLS is spontaneous intracranial hypotension, where pressure in the <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> severely decreased. This complication leads to the hallmark symptom of severe orthostatic headaches.|$|E
5|$|TBI {{is usually}} {{classified}} based on severity, anatomical {{features of the}} injury, and the mechanism (the causative forces). Mechanism-related classification divides TBI into closed and penetrating head injury. A closed (also called nonpenetrating, or blunt) injury occurs when the <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> not exposed. A penetrating, or open, head injury occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the dura mater, the outermost membrane surrounding the brain.|$|E
5|$|The <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> a fast {{tissue and}} might be in {{supersaturated}} state in the early phase of decompression. It acts as a gas reservoir and feeds any local bubble which will grow. The bubble may just proceed through the capillaries to the venous side for another cycle, but may be trapped and will then grow in place, causing local restriction of the blood supply and finally ischemia. This may develop into central neurological symptoms.|$|E

5|$|The <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> {{the largest}} known of any modern or extinct animal, {{weighing}} on average about , {{more than five}} times heavier than a human's, and has a volume of about 8,000cm3. Although larger brains generally correlate with higher intelligence, {{it is not the only}} factor. Elephants and dolphins also have larger brains than humans. The sperm whale has a lower encephalization quotient than many other whale and dolphin species, lower than that of non-human anthropoid apes, and much lower than humans'.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} {{is one of}} {{a number}} of species which has unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. One hemisphere of the <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> effectively asleep, while a low-voltage EEG, characteristic of wakefulness, is present in the other. The benefit of this is that the bird can rest in areas of high predation or during long migratory flights, but still retain a degree of alertness.|$|E

5|$|The {{function}} of the <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal. A centralized brain allows groups of muscles to be co-activated in complex patterns; it also allows stimuli impinging on {{one part of the}} body to evoke responses in other parts, and it can prevent different parts of the body from acting at cross-purposes to each other.|$|E
