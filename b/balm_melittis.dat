50|$|In the New Forest in England, P. longifolia shares its habitat {{with wild}} {{daffodil}} (Narcissus pseudonarcissus), bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), wood-sorrel (Oxalis acetosella), bastard <b>balm</b> (<b>Melittis</b> melissophyllum), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa), columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris).|$|E
50|$|The {{woods to}} the south of the manor house, {{on the banks of the}} Helford River, were {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1972 for their biological characteristics. The 72.2 ha site is of importance due to its population of Sessile Oak (Quercus petraea). Other notable species within the woods include the nationally uncommon Bastard <b>Balm</b> (<b>Melittis</b> melissophyllum) and the nationally rare mosses Fissidens curnowii and Hookeria lucens.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{wildfires}} of 1994 and 1998, pines {{dominated the}} landscape: Pinus nigra, Pinus halepensis Pinus sylvestris and {{a lesser extent}} Pinus pinea. After the fires Quercus humilis and Quercus ilex sprouts became the most visible trees. Where there is no forest predominate meadow Aphyllantion or Brachypodium and shrubs specially Dorycnum pentaphyllum and rosemary. It is remarkable the presence of he gypsophylous plant named ruac (Ononis tridentata) in some small gypsum patchs and the bastard <b>balm</b> (<b>Melittis</b> melissophyllum). Also interesting are the examples of yellow foxglove (Digitalis lutea), Primulas (Primula acaulis) and the broom (Genista cinerea).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to trap the {{volatiles}} released from whole frozen and dry aerial parts, and, separately, from different organs (leaves, stems, corolla and calyx) of bastard <b>balm</b> (<b>Melittis</b> melissophyllum L., Lamiaceae) populations collected in Italy and Slovakia by HS-SPME, and to identify the headspace constituents responsible for the characteristic aroma impression by GC/FID and GC/MS techniques. Among more than 100 volatile components detected, the C 8 alcohol oct- 1 -en- 3 -ol, responsible for the typical mushroom-like odor, and the phenolic coumarin, with a characteristic sweet and creamy vanilla bean odor, {{played a major role}} in the aroma of whole aerial parts and different plant organ samples. In particular, dry calyx parts could be proposed as flavoring agent in food products as mushroom aroma enhancer. Multivariate chemometric techniques, such as cluster analysis and principal component analysis, were used to characterize the sample populations according to the geographical origin and processing of plant material...|$|E
