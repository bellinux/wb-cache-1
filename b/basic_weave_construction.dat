40|$|An {{iterative}} decoding {{scheme for}} woven convolutional codes is presented. It operates {{in a window}} sliding over the received sequence. This exploits the nature of convolutional codewords as infinite sequences and reflects the concept of considering convolutional encoding and decoding as a continuous process. The decoder is analyzed in terms of decoding delay and decoding complexity. Its basic building block is a symbol-by-symbol a posteriori probability (APP) decoder for convolutional codes, which is a windowed variant of the well-known Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm. Additional interleaving for the <b>woven</b> <b>constructions</b> is introduced by employing convolutional scramblers. It is shown that row-wise random interleaving preserves the lower bound on the free distance of the original <b>woven</b> <b>constructions.</b> Based on {{the properties of the}} interleavers, new lower bounds on the free distance of <b>woven</b> <b>constructions</b> with both outer warp and inner warp are derived.

5000|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>weave</b> {{is called}} [...] "three-beat" [...] because each poi spins {{three times in}} a cycle: once {{on the same side of}} the body (e.g. left hand poi on left side) and twice on the {{opposite}} side.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the weaving performance and the visual perception abilities of primary school children. The sample population consisted of 50 first-graders, 26 boys and 24 girls. A measure was developed to test weaving performance; the children participated in a weaving lesson and then their products were evaluated by the author on a seven criterion evaluation form. To test visual perception abilities, the Marianne Frostig Developmental Test of Visual Perception was administered to the children. A Pearson Product-moment correlation coefficient was used to study the relationship of the variables. The findings reveal that the learning of <b>basic</b> <b>weaving</b> techniques was significantly related to two visual perception abilities: Figure-Ground perception (r = 0. 294) and Spatial Relationship (r = 0. 314) but not to Eye-Motor Coordination (r = 0. 271), Constancy of Shape (r = 0. 071), or Position in Space (r = 0. 111); neither was the <b>Basic</b> <b>Weaving</b> Score significantly related to the Perceptual Quotient (r = 0. 271) nor to the children's chronological age (r = 0. 164). The findings provide insight as to two of the factors, Figure- Ground perception and Spatial Relationships, which may be involved in the learning of <b>basic</b> <b>weaving</b> techniques. However, these correlations are very low which might indicate that there are other factors which may be more significantly related to weaving performance than visual perception abilities...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new micromechanical model to predict biaxial tensile moduli of {{plain weave fabric}} (PWF) composites by considering {{the interaction between the}} orthogonal interlacing strands. The two orthogonal yarns in micromechanical unit cell (UC) were idealized as curved beams with a path depicted by using sinusoidal shape functions. The biaxial tensile moduli of PWF composites were derived by means of the minimum total complementary potential energy principle founded on micromechanics. Biaxial tensile tests were conducted on the RTM-made EW 220 / 5284 PWF composites at five biaxial loading ratios of 0, 1, 2, 3 and ∞ to validate the new model. Predictions from the new model were compared with experimental data. Good correlation was achieved between the predictions and actual experiments, demonstrating the practical and effective use of the proposed model. Using the new model, the biaxial tensile moduli of plain weave fabric (PWF) composites can be predicted based only on the properties of <b>basic</b> <b>woven</b> fabric...|$|R
