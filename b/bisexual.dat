5|$|A {{population-based}} study {{completed by}} the National Alcohol Research Center {{found that women who}} identify as lesbian or <b>bisexual</b> are less likely to abstain from alcohol. Lesbians and <b>bisexual</b> women have a higher likelihood of reporting problems with alcohol, as well as not being satisfied with treatment for substance abuse programs. Many lesbian communities are centered in bars, and drinking is an activity that correlates to community participation for lesbians and <b>bisexual</b> women.|$|E

50|$|Much less {{research}} has been conducted into societal attitudes toward bisexuality.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} heterosexuals and <b>bisexuals</b> and their scores on hypersexual and psychopathology measures. Limited {{research has been done}} examining bisexuality, and the research that has been done is confounded by grouping <b>bisexuals</b> and homosexuals together, and inconsistencies in defining bisexuality (MacDonald, 1983). The present study examines sexual orientation by sexual behaviors, attractions, identity, fantasies, and an omnibus item. The study consisted of 863 college students. Half of the measures assessed hypersexuality and the other half-assessed psychopathologies. A series of multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) assessed the relationship between sexual orientation, hypersexuality, and psychopathologies. The present study found no differences between male heterosexuals and male <b>bisexuals</b> across any of the measures; however, differences were found between female heterosexuals and female <b>bisexuals.</b> Honors College"PSYSC 499.

5|$|Sycamore trees {{produce their}} flowers in hanging {{branched}} clusters known as panicles that contain {{a variety of}} different flower types. Most are morphologically <b>bisexual,</b> with both male and female organs, but function as if they were unisexual. Some are both morphologically and functionally male, others morphologically <b>bisexual</b> but function as males, and still others are morphologically <b>bisexual</b> but function as females. All of the flower types can produce pollen, but the pollen from functionally female flowers does not germinate. All flowers produce nectar, the functionally female flowers producing it in greater volume and with a higher sugar content.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} of the United Kingdom does not ask citizens to define their sexuality.

Estimates of lesbians are sometimes not differentiated in studies of same-sex households, such as those performed by the U.S. census, and estimates of total gay, lesbian, or <b>bisexual</b> population by the UK government.

Globally, the most common mode of HIV transmission is via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex; however, the pattern of transmission varies among countries.

In the US, gay and <b>bisexual</b> men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and <b>bisexual</b> men. About 15% of gay and <b>bisexual</b> men have HIV while 28 percent of transgender women test positive in the US.|$|E

5|$|Among whites, gender nonconformity {{appeared}} {{to be important in}} the development of homosexuality among masculine homosexual women, but not among homosexual women who were not masculine, while adolescent homosexual involvement was important for non-masculine homosexual women but not masculine homosexual women. <b>Bisexual</b> women {{appeared to}} be more influenced by involvement in homosexual genital activities in childhood than exclusively homosexual women, but unlike exclusively homosexual women, their homosexual preference did not appear related to inability to experience heterosexual arousal in childhood. Childhood gender nonconformity appeared more significant for exclusively homosexual women than for <b>bisexual</b> women, and more significant for women who had been in psychotherapy than for women who had not.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{deterministic}} model for transmission dynamics of Trichomonas vaginalis {{in a population}} with <b>bisexuals</b> is formulated and analysed. The disease free equilibrium point {{has been shown to}} be globally asymptotically stable when the reproduction number is less than a unity. Furthermore, the endemic equilib-rium point {{has been shown to be}} locally asymptotically stable and globally asymptotically stable for when the reproduction number is greater than a unity, using the Centre manifold theory and Liapunovs functional approach, respectively. Analysis of the reproduction number has shown that an increase in the number of infected <b>bisexuals</b> result in an increase in the number of infectives among heterosexuals and vise-versa. This suggests that straight women are turning into <b>bisexuals</b> already infected and that <b>bisexuals</b> are linked to straight females indirectly by males. Simulations results has shown that treatment is the major parameter in controlling the spread of the infection...|$|R
