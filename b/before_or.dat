5|$|Quenya {{allows for}} a very {{flexible}} word order {{because it is an}} inflectional language like Latin. Nevertheless, it has word order rules. The usual syntax structure is subject-verb-object. The adjective can be placed <b>before</b> <b>or</b> after the noun that it modifies.|$|E

5|$|After about 10 days (1–3 weeks {{depending}} on temperatures), larvae hatch and bore directly throughout the pod walls and develop within the seed. Larvae are thus protected from {{biological and chemical}} control. Larval development lasts two to three months. Before entering its pupal stage, the larva cuts a circular cap. After around ten days of pupal stage, the adult emerges from the seeds. Because mating and oviposition are spread over a few weeks, adults can emerge <b>before</b> <b>or</b> after harvest.|$|E

5|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} changes due {{to change}} of altitude <b>before</b> <b>or</b> after diving {{can have a}} significant influence on decompression risk.

5|$|Both Giovanni Borelli and Cassini made careful {{tables of}} {{the motions of}} Jupiter's moons, {{allowing}} predictions of the times when the moons would pass <b>before</b> <b>or</b> behind the planet. By the 1670s, {{it was observed that}} when Jupiter was {{on the opposite side of}} the Sun from Earth, these events would occur about 17minutes later than expected. Ole Rømer deduced that light does not travel instantaneously (a conclusion that Cassini had earlier rejected), and this timing discrepancy was used to estimate the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the season, {{eleven of}} Sewanee's {{victories}} were against SIAA conference rivals, setting the record for the most conference games won in a single season by any team <b>before</b> <b>or</b> since.

Additionally, forecasters at CSU predicted that the El Niño event that began in 1997 would dissipate either <b>before</b> <b>or</b> shortly after the 1998 season began.

The Rim Fire in 2013 destroyed nearly $2 billion in assets and revenue, though natural woodland assets are renewable, and closed off much of the park to tourists. This rim fire was the third largest on record, and burned nearly 500 acres of wild habitat.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the list}} follows the {{sequence}} {{in which the}} operas were written. There is uncertainty about whether La finta semplice was written <b>before</b> <b>or</b> after Bastien und Bastienne, and in some listings the former is given priority. Thamos was written in two segments, the earlier in 1774, but is listed in accordance with its completion in 177980. Die Zauberflöte and La clemenza di Tito were written concurrently. Die Zauberflote was started earlier and put aside for the Tito commission, which was completed and performed first and is usually listed as the earlier work despite having a higher Köchel catalogue number.|$|E
