40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical study of large-angle <b>beam</b> <b>slewing</b> with a double-octahedral adaptive truss and documents {{the performance of}} different control laws for simultaneous vibration control and <b>beam</b> <b>slewing.</b> A general nonlinear model of an adaptive truss and flexible beam is derived which includes a degree-of-freedom previously considered negligible for a double-octahedral adaptive truss actuated at its mid-plane. Linear and nonlinear, gain-scheduled, control laws are developed and applied to the nonlinear model for various large-angle slewing maneuvers. The nonlinear, gain-scheduled, control law is found to perform better than the linear control laws...|$|E
40|$|With {{the recent}} {{development}} of numerical methods for exactly solving larger order fuel-optlmal control problems, {{the implementation of}} exact real-time fuel-optimal control becomes possible. This paper describes a physical experiment in which a hinged-free <b>beam</b> is <b>slewed</b> in a fuel-optimal manner. A comparison between experimental results and the analytical predictions highlights the sources of errors typical of this class of problems...|$|R

Effectiveness of the compensator is also compared to the case when the full state is available for feedback...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} {{structures}} for vibration suppression {{is discussed in}} the context of using smart materials and structures. Here the use of smart structures refers to using embedded piezoelectric devices as both control actuators and sensors. Using embedded sensors and actuators allows great improvements in performance over traditional structures (both passive and active) for vibration suppression. The application of smart structures to three experimental flexible structures is presented. The first is a flexible beam, the second is a flexible <b>beam</b> undergoing <b>slewing</b> motion, the third is a ribbed antenna. A simple model of a piezoelectric actuator/sensor is presented. The equations of motion for each structure is presented. The control issues considered as those associated with multi-input, multi-output control, PID control and LQR control implementation. A modern control analysis illustrates the usefulness of smart structures for vibration suppression...|$|R
40|$|The exact eigenfunctions for the slewing link are found, {{taking into}} account a {{rotating}} inertia at the base and a payload at the tip. These derive from two equivalent formulations (pseudoclamped and pseudopinned) of the boundary value problem relative to the flexible <b>slewing</b> <b>beam.</b> The exactness of the solution {{makes it possible to}} prove the equivalence of these two approaches, which differ in the choice of the noninertial rotating frame. The two related dynamic linear models are then found, and a change of coordinates is given. Experimental measurements validate the theoretical results...|$|R
40|$|Examined {{here are}} the effects of motor {{dynamics}} and secondary piezoceramic actuators on vibration suppression during the slewing of flexible structures. The approach focuses on {{the interaction between the}} structure, the actuators, and the choice of control law. The results presented here are all simulated, but are based on experimentally determined parameters for the motor, structure, piezoceramic actuators, and piezofilm sensors. The simulation results clearly illustrate that the choice of motor inertia relative to beam inertia makes a critical difference in the performance of the system. In addition, the use of secondary piezoelectric actuators reduces the load requirements on the motor and also reduces the overshoot of the tip deflection. The structures considered here are a beam and a frame. The majority of results are based on a Euler Bernoulli <b>beam</b> model. The <b>slewing</b> frame introduces substantial torsional modes and a more realistic model. The slewing frame results are incomplete and represent work in progress...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formulation for the modeling of a single-link flexible beam that is undergoing slewing motion at an actively controlled pinned end, {{where the other}} end of the beam is free. This pinned end, or slewing axis, is of fixed orientation such that the beam rotates in the horizontal plane. A geared dc electric motor is connected to the <b>beam</b> at the <b>slewing</b> axis. A position and a velocity sensor are placed at this hinged location, and their proportional feedback provides a position control system about the slewing axis. The motor characteristics, gear ratio, and the position feedback constant determine an equivalent rotational spring constant, often called the servo stiffness. This paper generalizes the structure's boundary conditions at the slewing axis to include the effects of the servo system. It is shown that the clamped-free beam assumption for the dynamics of the structure is a valid assumption if the ratio of the servo stiffness to beam flexibility is high. However, for moderate or low values of this ratio, the clamped-free beam leads to erroneous system models so that it becomes necessary to consider the effects of the driving servo on the dynamics of the flexible beam...|$|R
40|$|For the UFFO CollaborationGamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are {{the most}} {{energetic}} explosions in the universe, their optical photon ﬂux rise very quickly, typically within one minute, then fall off gradually. Hundreds of GRBs optical light curves have been measured since the ﬁrst discovery of GRB in 1967. However, {{only a handful of}} measurements have been made within a minute after the gamma ray signal. Because of this drawback, the short-hard type GRBs and rapid-rising GRBs, which may account for 30 % of all GRBs, remain practically unexplored. To reach sub-minute timescales, the Ultra-Fast Flash Observatory (UFFO) uses a rapidly moving mirror to redirect the optical <b>beam</b> instead of <b>slewing</b> the entire spacecraft. The ﬁrst realization of this concept is UFFO-pathﬁnder, which is equipped with fast-response Slewing Mirror Telescope (SMT) and a UFFO Burst Alert and Trigger Telescope (UBAT). SMT has a slewing mirror to redirect optical photons into a telescope and then record them by an intensiﬁed CCD. UBAT uses coded mask to provide X-ray trigger from a GRB and provides the GRB location for SMT. UFFOs sub-minute measurements of the optical emission of dozens of GRBs each year will result in a more rigorous test of current internal shock models, probe the extremes of bulk Lorentz factors, provide the ﬁrst early and detailed measurements of fast-rise GRB optical light curves, and help verify the prospect of GRB as a new standard candle. The UFFO-pathﬁnder is fully integrated with the Lomonosov satellite and is scheduled to be launched in late 2013 or early 2014. We will present the latest progress in this conference...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the least}} {{documented}} and understood aspects of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is the rise phase of the optical light curve. The Ultra-Fast Flash Observatory (UFFO) {{is an effort to}} address this question through extraordinary opportunities presented by a series of space missions including a small spacecraft observatory. The UFFO is equipped with a fast-response Slewing Mirror Telescope (SMT) that uses a rapidly moving mirror or mirror array to redirect the optical <b>beam</b> rather than <b>slewing</b> the entire spacecraft to aim the optical instrument at the GRB position. The UFFO will probe the early optical rise of GRBs with sub-second response, for the first time, opening a completely new frontier in GRBs and transient studies. Its fast response measurements of the optical emission of dozens of GRBs each year will provide unique probes of the burst mechanism and test the prospect of GRBs as a new standard candle, potentially opening up the z > 10 universe. For the first time we employ a motorized slewing stage in SMT that can point to the event within 1 s after the x-ray trigger provided by the UFFO Burst Alert and Trigger Telescope. These two scientific instruments comprise the UFFO-pathfinder payload, which will be placed onboard the Lomonosov satellite and launched in 2013. The UFFO-pathfinder is the first step of our long-term program of space instruments for rapid-response GRB observations. We describe early photon science, our soon-to-be-launched UFFO-pathfinder hardware and mission, and our next planned mission, the UFFO- 100. © IOP Publishing and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.

40|$|The thesis {{centers on}} time domain {{modelling}} of viscoelastic materials. Classical models are compared to models involving fractional derivatives, which are derivatives of an order between 0 and 1. Parameters for classical and fractional order models are found for two materials, polymethylmethacrylate and 3 M ISD 112, an acrylic based material {{sold as a}} viscoelastic layer by 3 M. In both cases, only Prony series with several parameters achieve a good representation over a large frequency range. In the case of 3 M ISD 112, a fractional model with only two parameters gives a good representation over a frequency range of three decades, which is often sufficient. An algorithm based on an approximated definition of the fractional derivative and a trapezoidal rule is described to solve constitutive equations with fractional derivatives. The algorithm is implemented in C and tested against a numerical Laplace inverse for {{the case of a}} material submitted to sinusoidal strains. The algorithm gives accurate results and does not require very small steps, which is usually the case for algorithms based on finite differences or Grunwald series. The algorithm is adapted to the structure of a user subroutine of a commercial finite element package, Samcef, for a six component isotropic tensor. The model assumes a constant bulk modulus and has one fractional derivative of the deviatoric strain. The Jacobian of the constitutive equation with a fractional derivative is derived and implemented. The results from the subroutine are compared satisfactorily to results from the numerical Laplace inverse for a cubic element submitted to sinusoidal strains. Finally, the different models are tested to represent the experimental behaviour of <b>slewing</b> <b>beams</b> made either of polymethylmethacrylate or steel covered by constrained viscoelastic layers. The classical models give generally a poor representation of the experimental behaviour, except for the Prony series. The fractional model give a representation as satisfactory as the ones obtained with the Prony series, but for a much higher CPU times due to the hereditary nature of the fractional derivative. It is therefore recommended to use Prony series models, unless the data to perform the parameter identification is limited. In that case, the fractional order model becomes interesting despite the higher demands on the CPU time...|$|R
