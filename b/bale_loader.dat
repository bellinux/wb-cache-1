40|$|M. Tech. (Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Technology) Small scale farmers {{often lack}} the {{financial}} resources to purchase the necessary agricultural machinery to make their work easier and more efficient. Consequently they have to employ labourers {{to do the work}} manually, work that could otherwise be done by a machine faster and at a lower production cost. The majority of the existing agricultural machinery on the market is designed for large industrial scale farming and is unaffordable to the small scale farmer. After a small scale farming survey, it was found that there is an acute need for cheap agricultural machinery suitable to be used on a small farm, needing a maximum of 1 - 2 laborers to run the machine. A typical example in this regards is the production of hay bales. Hay is baled to make storage, transportation and selling easy. The most economically efficient hay bales are the large round bales with a mass of about 500 kg as they are durable with a low cost per unit mass of hay. However to produce round large bales expensive equipment and labour is needed. The objective of the present project was to design and manufacture a cheap easy to maneuver and efficient <b>bale</b> <b>loader,</b> affordable to the small farmers, who produce small rectangular bales, with limited material and labour resources. The main features of the new <b>bale</b> <b>loader</b> design are based on existing bale loaders, with the necessary changes and improvements to be fit for the purpose...|$|E
40|$|Of 22 {{patients}} {{admitted to}} Plains Health Centre, Regina, from January 1979 to April 1986 with spinal injuries due to farming accidents, 7 had injuries related to tractor-mounted front-end <b>bale</b> <b>loaders.</b> In contrast, {{none of the}} 12 patients admitted with farm-related spinal injuries from 1974 through 1978 had injuries related to <b>bale</b> <b>loaders.</b> All seven injuries occurred when a front-end loader was used to move a large, round hay bale. In each case when the loader arms were raised past the horizontal plane the bale rolled back onto the unprotected tractor operator. There were five thoracic injuries, one cervical injury and one lumbar injury. All seven bony injuries healed. Four of the patients had permanent neurologic sequelae; {{two of the four}} had paraplegia. All seven patients suffered disability that impaired work performance; all five farmers suffered some loss of income. None of these injuries would have occurred if available safety equipment had been in place...|$|R
40|$|This NebGuide {{covers the}} safety aspects for {{equipment}} used in large round bale packages such as: balers, front-end <b>loaders,</b> <b>bale</b> handling and transport devices. Large round baling creates unique safety problems for farmers and ranchers. Large round balers have many moving parts {{that can cause}} injury or death if a person becomes entangled. Never leave the tractor seat until the PTO (power take-off) has been disengaged, the engine is shut off, and all moving parts have stopped...|$|R
