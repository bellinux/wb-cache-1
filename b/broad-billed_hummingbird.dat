40|$|How does {{variability}} in nectar secretion rates affect {{the interaction between}} hummingbirds and the plants that: they pollinate? Other researchers have suggested that variability may influence pollinators to leave a plant earlier, thus increasing the potential for cross-pollination. My dissertation asks the following questions: Does {{variability in}} nectar secretion rates influence hummingbird visitation at a flower patch? Does it {{do so in a}} manner that is likely to increase; cross-pollination? And, does variability in these rates benefit the hummingbird by improving their foraging efficiency? By asking if variability benefits both plants and hummingbirds, I implicitly ask the question: Can variability in nectar secretion rates be a mechanism that helps keep this potentially antagonistic interaction positive? I developed an artificial flower that simulates nectar secretion. Using patches of these artificial flowers, I varied renewal rates of flowers found within a patch. The appendices describe the results of my studies. The aviary experiment (Appendix A) investigates how <b>Broad-billed</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> (Cynanthus latirostris) forage given variability in nectar renewal-rates. The field experiment (Appendix B) investigates how hummingbird visitation to patches with different renewal-rates might affect cross-pollination. Appendix C describes the hummingbird community at the study site. Appendix D identifies the plants visited by these hummingbirds. In the aviary experiment, <b>Broad-billed</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> changed their foraging when exposed to high variability and limited nectar. They visited a higher percentage of rewarding flowers, foraged more systematically, and significantly decreased their foraging time. These changes made their foraging more efficient. In the field experiment, increased renewal-rate variability was associated with hummingbirds visiting fewer artificial flowers per foraging bout. These results suggest cross-pollination may be increased. However, levels of renewal-rate variability did not affect the visitation rates to the flower patch or the distribution of nectar within the patch. Hummingbirds spent significantly more time probing the last flower in a foraging bout than other flowers, and preferentially ended foraging bouts on a rapidly renewing flower. I suggest that the energetic cost of hovering flight likely influenced this behavior. My results support the hypothesis that variability in nectar secretion rates may benefit both partners in this pollination mutualism...|$|R

40|$|Hummingbirds are nature’s {{masters of}} {{aerobatic}} manoeuvres. Previous {{research shows that}} hummingbirds and insects converged evolutionarily upon similar aerodynamic mechanisms and kinematics in hovering. Herein, we use three-dimensional kinematic data to begin to test for similar convergence of kinematics used for escape flight and to explore the effects of body size upon manoeuvring. We studied four hummingbird species in North America including two large species (magnificent hummingbird, Eugenes fulgens, 7. 8 g, and blue-throated hummingbird, Lampornis clemenciae, 8. 0 g) and two smaller species (<b>broad-billed</b> <b>hummingbird,</b> Cynanthus latirostris, 3. 4 g, and black-chinned hummingbirds Archilochus alexandri, 3. 1 g). Starting from a steady hover, hummingbirds consistently manoeuvred away from perceived threats using a drastic escape response that featured body pitch and roll rotations coupled with a large linear acceleration. Hummingbirds changed their flapping frequency and wing trajectory in all three degrees of freedom on a stroke-by-stroke basis, likely causing rapid and significant alteration of the magnitude and direction of aerodynamic forces. Thus {{it appears that the}} flight control of hummingbirds does not obey the ‘helicopter model’ that is valid for similar escape manoeuvres in fruit flies. Except for broad-billed hummingbirds, the hummingbirds had faster reaction times than those reported for visual feedback control in insects. The two larger hummingbird species performed pitch rotations and global-yaw turns with considerably larger magnitude than the smaller species, but roll rates and cumulative roll angles were similar among the four species...|$|E
