5|$|Risk factors {{indicating}} {{an increased}} risk of death include older age, female gender, a history of liver cirrhosis, biliary narrowing due to cancer, acute renal failure and the presence of liver abscesses. Complications following severe cholangitis include renal failure, respiratory failure (inability of the respiratory system to oxygenate blood and/or eliminate carbon dioxide), cardiac arrhythmia, wound infection, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding and myocardial ischemia (lack of <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart, leading to heart attacks).|$|E
5|$|When the {{atrioventricular}} valves (tricuspid and mitral) are open, during <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ventricles, the aortic and pulmonary valves {{are closed}} to prevent backflow into the ventricles. When the ventricular pressure {{is greater than}} the atrial pressure the tricuspid and mitral valves will shut. When the ventricles contract the pressure forces the aortic and pulmonary valves open. As the ventricles relax, the aortic and pulmonary valves will close in response to decreased pressure.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{facilities}} are {{equipped to handle}} TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center. Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain herniation. Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes.|$|E
5000|$|Coronary artery bypass surgery: This surgery {{creates a}} new pathway for <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart. Taking a healthy piece of vein, the surgeon {{attaches}} it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coronary artery, just above and below <b>the</b> blockage <b>to</b> allow bypass.|$|R
25|$|In crude terms, this {{measurement}} compares {{left and}} right cardiac activity and calculates preload and afterload flow and pressures which, theoretically, can be stabilized or adjusted with drugs to either constrict or dilate <b>the</b> vessels (<b>to</b> raise or lower, respectively, <b>the</b> pressure of <b>blood</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lungs), {{in order to maximize}} oxygen for delivery <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body tissues.|$|R
50|$|Venous {{return is}} {{the rate of}} <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart. It {{normally}} limits cardiac output.|$|R
5|$|Fish are cold-blooded, and {{in general}} their body {{temperature}} {{is the same as}} that of their surroundings. They gain and lose heat through their skin and during respiration and are able to regulate their circulation in response to changes in water temperature by increasing or reducing the <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gills. Metabolic heat generated in the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through the gills, with blood being diverted away from the gills during exposure to cold. Because of their relative inability to control their blood temperature, most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Narcosis {{has been}} {{compared}} with altitude sickness regarding its variability of onset (though not its symptoms); its effects depend on many factors, with variations between individuals. Thermal cold, stress, heavy work, fatigue, and carbon dioxide retention all increase the risk and severity of narcosis. Carbon dioxide has a high narcotic potential and also causes increased <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain, increasing the effects of other gases. Increased risk of narcosis results from {{increasing the amount of}} carbon dioxide retained through heavy exercise, shallow or skip breathing, or because of poor gas exchange in the lungs.|$|E
5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} {{is caused}} by either a single instance of acute trauma to the knee, or repeated minor trauma to the knee. The trauma can cause extravasation of nearby fluids into the bursa, which stimulates an inflammatory response. This response occurs in two phases: The vascular phase, in which the <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surrounding area increases, and the cellular phase, in which leukocytes migrate from the blood to the affected area. Other possible causes include gout, sarcoidosis, CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, uremia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some cases are idiopathic, though these {{may be caused by}} trauma that the patient does not remember.|$|E
50|$|The {{necrosis}} of the lunate bone can frequently {{be traced}} to a trauma <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wrist, like a compound fracture, which could cause the lunate's blood supply <b>to</b> be interrupted. <b>Blood</b> <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lunate through several arteries, each supplying a percentage. When one of these pathways is severed, the likelihood the patient will develop necrosis increases.Despite a preponderance of evidence, no particular cause has been conclusively verified.|$|R
50|$|Venous {{insufficiency}} {{results when}} the normal {{functioning of the}} valves, which serve <b>to</b> keep <b>blood</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart and <b>to</b> prevent reflux, become damaged and incompetent. This incompetence will result in an insufficient bloodflow through the affected vein or veins. In varicose veins the valves are damaged or missing and the insufficiency will be chronic. When the valves are damaged blood leaks and pools in the legs and feet.|$|R
50|$|The {{blood vessel}} {{formations}} associated with SWS {{start in the}} fetal stage. Around the sixth week of development, a network of nerves develops around the area that will become a baby’s head. Normally, this network goes away in the ninth week of development. In babies with SWS due to mutation of gene GNAQ, this network of nerves doesn’t go away. This reduces the amount of oxygen and <b>blood</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain, which can affect brain tissue development.|$|R
5|$|The second theory {{posits that}} either {{increased}} <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain or {{increase in the}} brain tissue itself may result in the raised pressure. Little evidence has accumulated to support the suggestion that increased blood flow plays a role, but recently Bateman et al. in phase contrast MRA studies have quantified cerebral blood flow (CBF) in vivo and suggests that CBF is abnormally elevated in many patients with IIH. Both biopsy samples and various types of brain scans have shown an increased water content of the brain tissue. It remains unclear why {{this might be the}} case.|$|E
5|$|When submerged, a crocodilian's {{heart rate}} slows {{down to one}} or two beats a minute, and <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> muscles is reduced. When it rises and takes a breath, its heart rate speeds up in seconds, and the muscles receive newly oxygenated blood. Unlike many marine mammals, {{crocodilians}} have little myoglobin to store oxygen in their muscles. During diving, muscles are supplied with oxygen when an increasing concentration of bicarbonate ions causes haemoglobin in the blood to release oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is also known}} as ischemic heart disease, is caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the inner walls of the arteries which narrows them, reducing the <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the heart muscle, causing unstable angina or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.|$|E
50|$|Hematophagous organisms {{have been}} used by {{physicians}} for beneficial purposes (hirudotherapy). Some doctors now use leeches <b>to</b> prevent <b>the</b> clotting of blood on some wounds following surgery or trauma. The anticoagulants in the laboratory-raised leeches' saliva keeps fresh <b>blood</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> site of an injury, actually preventing infection and increasing chances of full recovery. In a recent study a genetically engineered drug called desmoteplase based on the saliva of Desmodus rotundus (the vampire bat) was shown to improve recovery in stroke patients.|$|R

40|$|Radial artery {{occlusion}} is {{a potential}} complication of transradial procedures and its occurrence ranges from 0. 8 to 30 %. It is virtually always asymptomatic but the functional and sensorial consequences of a long acting hand hypoperfusion could go underestimated. CardioWaves is a novel photoplethysmograh device that allows us <b>to</b> detect <b>the</b> pulse wave amplitude of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hand.

5|$|Like other animals, fish {{suffer from}} {{diseases}} and parasites. To prevent disease {{they have a}} variety of defenses. Non-specific defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. If pathogens breach these defenses, fish can develop an inflammatory response that increases <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an immune response. In recent years, vaccines have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example furunculosis vaccines in farmed salmon and koi herpes virus in koi.|$|E
5|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} {{and mechanical}} ventilation {{may be used}} to ensure proper oxygen supply and provide a secure airway. Hypotension (low blood pressure), which has a devastating outcome in TBI, can be prevented by giving intravenous fluids to maintain a normal blood pressure. Failing to maintain blood pressure can result in inadequate <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain. Blood pressure may be kept at an artificially high level under controlled conditions by infusion of norepinephrine or similar drugs; this helps maintain cerebral perfusion. Body temperature is carefully regulated because increased temperature raises the brain's metabolic needs, potentially depriving it of nutrients. Seizures are common. While they can be treated with benzodiazepines, these drugs are used carefully because they can depress breathing and lower blood pressure. TBI patients are more susceptible to side effects and may react adversely or be inordinately sensitive to some pharmacological agents. During treatment monitoring continues for signs of deterioration such as a decreasing level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} studies give two thermoregulatory roles for the sail of Dimetrodon: one {{as a means of}} warming quickly in the morning, and another as a way to cool down when body {{temperature}} becomes high. Dimetrodon and all other Early Permian land vertebrates are assumed to have been cold-blooded or poikilothermic, relying on the sun to maintain a high body temperature. Because of its large size, Dimetrodon had high thermal inertia, meaning that changes in body temperature occurred more slowly in it than in smaller-bodied animals. As temperatures rose in the mornings, the small-bodied prey of Dimetrodon could warm their bodies much faster than could something the size of Dimetrodon. Many paleontologists including Haack have proposed that the sail of Dimetrodon may have allowed it to warm quickly in the morning in order to keep pace with its prey. The sail's large surface area also meant heat could dissipate quickly into the surroundings, useful if the animal needed to release excess heat produced by metabolism or absorbed from the sun. Dimetrodon may have angled its sail away from the sun to cool off or restricted <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sail to maintain heat at night.|$|E
5|$|Venous {{insufficiency}} {{results when}} the vein dilates secondary to a vein wall disease or when normal {{functioning of the}} valves, which serve <b>to</b> keep <b>blood</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart and <b>to</b> prevent reflux, become damaged and/or incompetent (the dilation of a vein will prevent valves to close properly). This incompetence will result in an reversed <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> through the affected vein or veins. In varicose veins the valves are damaged, disfunction or missing and the insufficiency will be chronic. The reversed blood pools in the low third of legs and feet.|$|R

30|$|The {{addition}} of <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> rate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> multilevel models {{did not significantly}} alter any of the measured outcome variables (p[*]=[*] 0.784 for CI, p[*]=[*] 0.600 for GEDVI, p[*]=[*] 0.237 for EVLWI).|$|R
5|$|Studies on induced animal {{models of}} human diseases. Here, an animal is treated {{so that it}} {{develops}} pathology and symptoms that resemble a human disease. Examples include restricting <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain to induce stroke, or giving neurotoxins that cause damage similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease. Such studies {{can be difficult to}} interpret, and it is argued that they are not always comparable to human diseases. For example, although such models are now widely used to study Parkinson's disease, the British anti-vivisection interest group BUAV argues that these models only superficially resemble the disease symptoms, without the same time course or cellular pathology. In contrast, scientists assessing the usefulness of animal models of Parkinson's disease, as well as the medical research charity The Parkinson's Appeal, state that these models were invaluable and that they led to improved surgical treatments such as pallidotomy, new drug treatments such as levodopa, and later deep brain stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Neuroimaging {{is helpful}} but not {{flawless}} in detecting raised ICP. A more accurate {{way to measure}} ICP is to place a catheter into a ventricle of the brain, which has {{the added benefit of}} allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain, releasing pressure in the skull. Treatment of raised ICP may be as simple as tilting the patient's bed and straightening the head to promote blood flow through the veins of the neck. Sedatives, analgesics and paralytic agents are often used. Hypertonic saline can improve ICP by reducing the amount of cerebral water (swelling), though it is used with caution to avoid electrolyte imbalances or heart failure. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, appears to be equally effective at reducing ICP. Some concerns; however, have been raised regarding some of the studies performed. Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, may be used to treat high intracranial pressures, but may cause hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume). Hyperventilation (larger and/or faster breaths) reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict; this decreases <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain and reduces ICP, but it potentially causes ischemia and is, therefore, used only in the short term. Administration of corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death, and so it is recommended that they not be given routinely.|$|E
5|$|Rhabdomyolysis {{may cause}} kidney failure by several mechanisms. The most {{important}} is the accumulation of myoglobin in the kidney tubules. Normally, the blood protein haptoglobin binds circulating myoglobin and other heme-containing substances, but in rhabdomyolysis the quantity of myoglobin exceeds the binding capacity of haptoglobin. Myoglobinuria, the presence of myoglobin in the urine, occurs when the level in plasma exceeds 0.5–1.5mg/dl; once plasma levels reach 100mg/dl, the concentration in the urine becomes sufficient {{for it to be}} visibly discolored and corresponds with the destruction of about 200grams of muscle. As the kidneys reabsorb more water from the , myoglobin interacts with Tamm–Horsfall protein in the nephron to form casts (solid aggregates) that obstruct the normal flow of fluid; the condition is worsened further by high levels of uric acid and acidification of the filtrate, which increase cast formation. Iron released from the heme generates reactive oxygen species, damaging the kidney cells. In addition to the myoglobinuria, two other mechanisms contribute to kidney impairment: low blood pressure leads to constriction of the blood vessels and therefore a relative lack of <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kidney, and finally uric acid may form crystals in the tubules of the kidneys, causing obstruction. Together, these processes lead to acute tubular necrosis, the destruction of the cells of tubules. Glomerular filtration rate falls and the kidney is unable to perform its normal excretory functions. This causes disruption of electrolyte regulation, leading to a further rise in potassium levels, and interferes with vitamin D processing, further worsening the low calcium levels.|$|E
50|$|When {{a patient}} {{needs to have}} a stent placed in one of the vessels around their heart, it is {{important}} that that stent stay open <b>to</b> keep <b>blood</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart. Therefore, patients with stents must take medications after <b>the</b> procedure <b>to</b> help maintain that <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> Ticlopidine, taken together with aspirin, is FDA approved for this purpose, and in studies it has been shown to work better than aspirin alone or aspirin with an anticoagulant. However, ticlopidine’s serious side effects make it less useful than its cousin, clopidogrel. Current recommendations no longer recommend ticlopidine’s use.|$|R
50|$|Reactive {{hyperaemia}} often {{occurs as}} a consequence of Raynaud's phenomenon, where the vasospasm in <b>the</b> vasculature leads <b>to</b> ischaemia and necrosis of tissue and thus a subsequent increase in <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> remove <b>the</b> waste products and clear up cell debris.|$|R
50|$|It can be {{cumbersome}} <b>to</b> {{ensure that}} <b>the</b> sensor shining an infra-red light and monitoring the reflected light is always {{pointing at the}} same extremity, especially seeing as subjects often stretch and readjust their position whilst using a computer.There are other factors which can affect one's blood volume pulse. As it {{is a measure of}} <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> through the extremities, if the subject feels hot, or particularly cold, then their body may allow more, or less, <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extremities, all of this regardless of the subject's emotional state.|$|R
5|$|Secondary injury events include {{damage to}} the blood–brain barrier, release of factors that cause inflammation, free radical overload, {{excessive}} release of the neurotransmitter glutamate (excitotoxicity), influx of calcium and sodium ions into neurons, and dysfunction of mitochondria. Injured axons in the brain's white matter may separate from their cell bodies {{as a result of}} secondary injury, potentially killing those neurons. Other factors in secondary injury are changes in the <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain; ischemia (insufficient blood flow); cerebral hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the brain); cerebral edema (swelling of the brain); and raised intracranial pressure (the pressure within the skull). Intracranial pressure may rise due to swelling or a mass effect from a lesion, such as a hemorrhage. As a result, cerebral perfusion pressure (the pressure of blood flow in the brain) is reduced; ischemia results. When the pressure within the skull rises too high, it can cause brain death or herniation, in which parts of the brain are squeezed by structures in the skull. A particularly weak part of the skull that is vulnerable to damage causing extradural haematoma is the pterion, deep in which lies the middle meningeal artery, which is easily damaged in fractures of the pterion. Since the pterion is so weak, this type of injury can easily occur and can be secondary due to trauma {{to other parts of the}} skull where the impact forces spreads to the pterion.|$|E
25|$|Proper kidney {{function}} {{depends upon}} adequate <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kidney. Kidney blood flow is a complex, tightly regulated process {{that relies on}} a number of hormones and other small molecules, such as prostaglandins. Under normal circumstances, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) produced by the kidney is necessary to support adequate <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kidney. Like all prostaglandins, PGE2 synthesis depends upon the cyclooxygenases.|$|E

50|$|Prerenal {{azotemia}} {{is caused}} by a decrease in <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (hypoperfusion) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kidneys. However, there is no inherent kidney disease. It can occur following hemorrhage, shock, volume depletion, congestive heart failure, adrenal insufficiency, and narrowing of the renal artery among other things.|$|R
5|$|Fish have a {{closed-loop}} circulatory system. The heart pumps {{the blood}} in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third part, ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps <b>the</b> blood, first <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aorta, through which <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gills for oxygenation.|$|R
