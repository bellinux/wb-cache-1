5|$|Thriller writers Frederick Forsyth and Andy McNab {{claimed that}} the killing of Alexander Litvinenko {{is a classic case}} of fact being {{stranger}} than fiction and that they would <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> a losing battle if they offered a Litvinenko-style story to a publisher.|$|E
5|$|Abu Hurairah {{said that}} the Prophet said: There will be an Ayah (sign) in (the month of) Ramadan. Then, there will 'isabah (splitting into groups) in Shawwal.

60|$|Then {{the call}} came and {{we went into the}} ring. Bill was desperate. He fought like a tiger, a madman. He was fair crazy. He <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> for more than I <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> for. I <b>was</b> a rising fighter, and I <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> for the money and the recognition. But Bill <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> for life--for the life of his loved ones.|$|R

5|$|Basil Mitchell {{responded to}} Flew's falsification {{principle}} {{with his own}} parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, {{even if he is}} seen to <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.|$|E
5|$|No. 4 Commando {{was formed}} in Weymouth on 21 July 1940, when the first intake of 500 volunteers arrived. The unique nature of the commandos {{immediately}} became apparent when every man was held responsible for finding his own quarters. As commandos were expected to <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> troops, they had no administrative personnel, such as clerks and cooks for example. To assist them with living 'off camp', with no cook house all ranks were given a daily allowance and a ration card, the allowance being 67 pence for officers and of 34 pence for other ranks. This arrangement meant that commandos lived on civilian rations, {{while the rest of}} the armed forces had the more plentiful military scale of rations.|$|E
5|$|Up to {{the late}} spring of 1940, Fighter Command had been {{preparing}} to meet a possible air attack on the British Isles coming only from due east, from Germany itself; prior to the German victory in Western Europe. The possibility that France might fall and Britain would continue to fight on had not been considered. An air attack from Germany meant the Luftwaffe's bombers would operate beyond the range of their fighters and be vulnerable to attack. If twin-engine fighters, such as the Messerschmitt Bf 110s were used, they would <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> at {{the limits of their}} range.|$|E

5|$|As Stauffenberg flies back to Berlin, Olbricht {{refuses to}} {{mobilize}} the Reserve Army until he knows without a doubt that Hitler is dead (if Hitler isn't dead, Olbricht will be arrested for having the reserve army mobilized without Fromm's permission). Behind Olbricht's back, Mertz forges his signature and issues the orders anyway. With Operation Valkyrie underway, Stauffenberg and his fellow plotters order the arrest of Nazi party leaders and SS officers, convincing lower officers that the Party and the SS are staging a coup. As Army soldiers begin {{to take control of}} Berlin's government ministries, including SS headquarters, mid-level officers relaying the orders begin to wonder which side they should <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> for. Rumors reach Berlin that Hitler survived the blast, but Stauffenberg dismisses them as SS propaganda. Meanwhile, Fromm learns from Field Marshal Keitel that Hitler is still alive. The General refuses to join the plotters, resulting in them detaining him. Major Otto Ernst Remer of the Reserve Army prepares to arrest Goebbels, but is stopped when Goebbels connects him by phone to Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Odin {{will make}} {{directly}} for Fenrir and the god Thor, by Odin's side, {{will be unable}} to help him because he will <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> Jörmungandr. The god Freyr will engage the fiery being Surtr and, since Freyr lacks the sword he gave his servant Skírnir, Freyr will fall after a rough struggle. The god Tyr will fight the hound Garmr and the two will kill one another. Thor will kill the serpent Jörmungandr but after nine steps will collapse to the ground, dead from Jörmungandr's venom. Fenrir will eat Odin, but immediately after Odin's son Víðarr will come forward and set his foot on to the wolf's lower jaw, and grasp its upper jaw, ripping its mouth apart, killing it. Loki and Heimdallr will kill one another and, after their death, Surtr will spray fire over the earth and burn the entire world.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} first fully {{introduced}} to the Terrans in Episode I of StarCraft. For {{a number of years}} before the game begins, the Confederacy is shown to <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> a slowly losing war against the Sons of Korhal. When the Zerg and Protoss make their existence known, the pace of the war quickly changes. The player, accompanied by Jim Raynor, joins up with Arcturus Mengsk and the Sons of Korhal, and helps bring about the fall of the Confederacy by using Confederate technology to lure the Zerg into destroying the Confederate capital Tarsonis. In the process however, Mengsk abandons his second-in-command, Sarah Kerrigan, to the Zerg on Tarsonis. As a result of the brutal tactics used by Mengsk and his needless sacrifice of Kerrigan to the Zerg, Raynor abandons Mengsk and his newly formed Dominion to search for the lost Kerrigan. When Raynor finally finds her on the planet Char it is revealed that she had been captured and infested by the Zerg Overmind. He then meets Zeratul and Tassadar and consequently becomes an ally to the Protoss. Raynor's forces assist the Protoss in defending their homeworld from the Zerg and in destroying the Zerg Overmind in the game's conclusion.|$|E

25|$|The {{reasons for}} {{fighting}} vary from group to group. The FARC and other guerrilla movements claim to <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> {{for the rights}} of the poor in Colombia to protect them from government violence and to provide social justice through communism. The Colombian government claims to <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> for order and stability, and seeking to protect the rights and interests of its citizens. The paramilitary groups claim to be reacting to perceived threats by guerrilla movements. Both guerrilla and paramilitary groups have been accused of engaging in drug trafficking and terrorism. All of the parties engaged in the conflict have been criticized for numerous human rights violations.|$|E

60|$|We must pause {{here again}} {{for a moment to}} think where we are, and who is with us. The Teutsch Ritters have <b>been</b> <b>fighting,</b> {{independently}} of all states, for their own hand, or St. Adalbert's; partly for mere love of fight, partly for love of order, partly for love of God. Meantime, other Riders have <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> wholly for what they could get by it; and other persons, not Riders, have not <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> at all, but in their own towns peacefully manufacturing and selling.|$|R

25|$|Training {{exercises}} continued {{along the}} north coast, which caused {{a certain amount of}} boredom amongst the officers and men who by now had expected to <b>be</b> <b>fighting.</b> On 19 April 1941, the regiment moved to Abercorn Barracks at Ballykinlar and re-equipped as an armoured regiment with Mk I Valentine tanks.|$|E

25|$|Napoleon's defeat {{was also}} {{somewhat}} mirrored by Hitler's failed invasion of Russia during World War II in 1941. Although, ironically, Hitler had studied Napoleon's battle tactics, he decided, against {{the advice of}} many of his top advisers, to invade Russia and break his pact with Stalin. He knew the invasion would have only one chance and if he failed, he would <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> a war on two fronts (the Western Front consisting of the Western Allies and the Eastern Front which would consist of the Soviet Union) which also proved fatal in Napoleon's situation. In 1812, Napoleon had been campaigning in Spain as well as Russia and had failed in both. In 1941, Hitler had to split his army in order to conquer Russia and in doing so, perhaps lost the war solely on that point. After Stalin found out what had happened, he orchestrated the Battle of Moscow which, along with the notoriously cold Russian winter, stopped the German troops and finally pushed them back. Hitler would now <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> on two fronts.|$|E

25|$|Coming off {{a series}} defeat in India, England were low in confidence, {{and even their}} star {{performer}} in India and Sri Lanka, Graeme Hick, was still considered to <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> for his place, judging by comments to the media by coach Keith Fletcher. Graham Gooch resigned the captaincy after the Fourth Test, once the series was decided, and Mike Atherton led the side {{in the final two}} tests, winning the Sixth, at The Oval.|$|E

He was subsequently placed in a medically-induced coma. He was released from hospital in September 2015.|$|E
25|$|Kennedy later {{decided to}} embark on the trip with three basic goals in mind: {{he wanted to help}} raise more Democratic Party presidential {{campaign}} fund contributions; he wanted to begin his quest for reelection in November 1964; and, because the Kennedy-Johnson ticket had barely won Texas in 1960 (and had even lost in Dallas), President Kennedy wanted to help mend political fences among several leading Texas Democratic party members who appeared to <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> politically amongst themselves.|$|E
