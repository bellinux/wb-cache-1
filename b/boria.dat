500|$|Remarking on the {{contrast}} between the dying figures in the foreground and the figures in the mid-ground waving towards the approaching rescue ship, the French art historian Georges-Antoine <b>Borias</b> wrote that Géricault's painting represents, [...] "on the one hand, desolation and death.

5000|$|He is {{the older}} brother of Eve {{and the son of}} Xena and <b>Borias.</b> During Xena's {{pregnancy}} with Solan, Alti cursed her unborn child, in order to prevent Xena changing her dark ways as Alti knew that Xena's child would eventually bring Xena back to the light. Xena escaped from Alti. However, the prophecy would later be fulfilled and Solan never knew the love of either of his parents. Shortly after Xena gives birth to him, <b>Borias</b> is killed by Dagnine and a woman named Satrina, Xena's ex-slave. Borias's abandonment and death made Xena eventually realize what a monster she had become. Afraid she would be a bad influence on her child, She gave her newborn son Solan to the centaur Kaleipus, because she believed that he did not deserve a mother like her, and so he would be raised in safety and away from her dangerous influence or a target to her enemies. So, Solan never knew his father, or that the ex-warlord Xena was his mother.|$|R
500|$|Ganguly's {{decision}} to bowl first was criticised by the media: The New York Times, for instance, said it [...] "backfired horribly". Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan, while denouncing Ganguly's decision, also criticised {{his idea of}} going into the match with an unchanged side. He stated that India should have played their leg spinner Anil Kumble as the ball was [...] "gripping [...] the surface". The journalist and former England cricketer Mike Selvey believed that Ganguly may {{have been influenced by}} the possibility of the Duckworth–Lewis method affecting the result. Indian journalist <b>Boria</b> Majumdar in his book, Cricketing Cultures in Conflict (2004), remarked about the possibility of Australia losing the rain-interrupted final, if the result were to be decided by this method. Ganguly defended his decision saying that the overcast conditions and moisture in the pitch meant it was favourable to the bowlers, but they failed to use it properly. Ponting said that he would have opted to bat first had they won the toss. His teammate Symonds, in an interview later, recalled that India's {{decision to}} bowl first gave them an impression that they were not [...] "confident enough to take the fight".|$|E

5000|$|There was {{a chapel}} at La Grande Pointe {{sometime}} after 1874. Some {{sources say that}} it was named for St. Etienne, but that is not a certainty. In January 1889, Father <b>Borias</b> of Breaux Bridge wrote that [...] "the chapel was originally located about midway between the Four Corners and Grand Anse area, but later was moved closer to what is now Cecilia." [...] A church parish was created at Cecilia in 1890 and Rev. Augustin Blanc became first pastor. He would serve there for more than 38 years. St. Rose of Lima Church was established there for the African American congregation in 1944.|$|R
500|$|Géricault was {{captivated by}} {{accounts}} of the widely publicised 1816 shipwreck, and realised that a depiction of the event might be an opportunity to establish {{his reputation as a}} painter. Having decided to proceed, he undertook extensive research before he began the painting. In early 1818, he met with 2 survivors: Henri Savigny, a surgeon, and Alexandre Corréard, an engineer from the École nationale supérieure d'arts et métiers. Their emotional descriptions of their experiences largely inspired the tone of the final painting. According to the art historian Georges-Antoine <b>Borias,</b> [...] "Géricault established his studio across from Beaujon hospital. And here began a mournful descent. Behind locked doors he threw himself into his work. Nothing repulsed him. He was dreaded and avoided." ...|$|R

In December the same year, he {{was put in charge}} of the Indian Youth Congress. He first showed his organisational ability by [...] "working round the clock" [...] on the 1982 Asian Games. He was one of 33 members of the Indian parliament who were part of the Games' organising committee; sports historian <b>Boria</b> Majumdar writes that being [...] "son of the prime minister he had a moral and unofficial authority" [...] over the others. The report submitted by the Asian Games committee mentions Gandhi's [...] "drive, zeal and initiative" [...] for the [...] "outstanding success" [...] of the games.|$|E
2500|$|Reportedly, {{progress}} was still slow and {{four or five}} accommodation towers built by Emaar at the Games village were unfinished, lacking facilities such as wireless internet, fitted toilets and plumbing. In addition, rubble, unused masonry and discarded bricks littered the unfinished gardens. According to sports historian <b>Boria</b> Majumdar, author of the Sellotape Legacy: Delhi and the Commonwealth Games, India [...] "may have to pull a miracle." [...] The father of Australian track cyclist Kaarle McCulloch visited his daughter at the Olympic village. A builder in Australia, Grahame McCulloch criticised the structural soundness of the village; he said [...] "those buildings are the dodgiest things I have ever seen...so substandard".

Under her friend's guidance, she learns to put aside {{a great deal of}} her hatred and pain. Additionally, Lao Ma heals Xena's crippled legs and teaches her more about pressure points. Lao Ma gives Xena the metaphorical title [...] "Warrior Princess", intending that she be a major catalyst for change in the land. In the end, Lao Ma's efforts come to nothing, {{at least in the short}} term. In the long run, however, Lao Ma's teachings are instrumental in shaping the good person she was to become.|$|R

5000|$|Over {{the course}} of the series, viewers were also {{introduced}} to family members of both Xena and Gabrielle, but most notably featured their children. Xena gave her first child, a son named Solan, to a group of centaurs {{after the death of his}} father, <b>Borias,</b> who was killed in combat against a warrior in Xena's employ. Solan never knew that Xena was his mother, however knowing Xena for a long time. While aiding Xena and Boudica to defend Britannia against Caesar, Gabrielle comes into contact with an evil cult that tricks her into killing one of its priestesses, Meridian. Using her, the dark god Dahak impregnates Gabrielle just as Xena rescues her. Over the next few days the child grows inside Gabrielle, and she eventually (and quite dramatically) gives birth to a girl, naming her Hope. Even though she is the seed of an evil deity, Gabrielle tells Xena that she is also a part of her and that there must be some good in her as well. Being the daughter of Dahak, she quickly developed supernatural powers, and kills within hours of being born, proving to Xena that there was no chance of saving her. Hope aged amazingly fast, and, mere months after being drifted down a river by her mother, she appeared to be about 9 years old. Despite Gabrielle's hopes that she would [...] "be good", Hope killed Xena's son Solan before being poisoned by Gabrielle herself.|$|R
