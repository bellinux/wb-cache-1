40|$|Copper {{wire bonds}} have {{replaced}} gold wire bonds {{in the majority}} of commercial semiconductor devices for the latest technology nodes. Although economics has been the driving mechanism to lower semiconductor packaging costs for a savings of about 20 % by replacing gold wire bonds with copper, copper also has materials property advantages over gold. When compared to gold, copper has approximately: 25 % lower electrical resistivity, 30 % higher thermal conductivity, 75 % higher tensile strength and 45 % higher modulus of elasticity. Copper wire bonds on aluminum bond pads are also more mechanically robust over time and elevated temperature due to the slower intermetallic formation rate - approximately 1 / 100 th that of the gold to aluminum intermetallic formation rate. However, there are significant tradeoffs with copper wire bonding - copper has twice the hardness of gold which results in a narrower <b>bonding</b> <b>manufacturing</b> process window and requires that the semiconductor companies design more mechanically rigid bonding pads to prevent cratering to both the bond pad and underlying chip structure. Furthermore, copper is significantly more prone to corrosion issues. The semiconductor packaging industry has responded to this corrosion concern by creating a palladium coated copper bonding wire, which is more corrosion resistant than pure copper bonding wire. Also, the selection of the device molding compound is critical because use of environmentally friendly green compounds can result in internal CTE (Coefficient of Thermal Expansion) mismatches with the copper wire bonds that can eventually lead to device failures during thermal cycling. Despite the difficult problems associated with the changeover to copper bonding wire, there are billions of copper wire bonded devices delivered annually to customers. It is noteworthy that Texas Instruments announced in October of 2014 that they are shipping microcircuits containing copper wire bonds for safety critical automotive applications. An evaluation of copper wire bond technology for applicability to spaceflight hardware may be warranted along with concurrently compiling a comprehensive understanding of the failure mechanisms involved with copper wire bonded semiconductor devices...|$|R

The major limitation has been nonmetallic joining using poor thermal interface materials (TIM). The interfacial, versus bulk, thermal conductivity of an adhesive is the major loss mechanism and normally accounts for an order magnitude loss in conductivity per equivalent thickness. The next generation TIM requires a sophisticated understanding of material and surface sciences, heat transport at submicron scales, and the manufacturing processes used in packaging of microelectronics and other target applications.

The initial step in the process requires that the wafers are sufficiently smooth, flat and compliant such that short-range surface forces can elastically deform the wafers and bring the surfaces into complete contact.

An energy-based analysis is used to develop the models that allow acceptable limits of wafer-scale flatness variations to be predicted.

40|$|Part 4 : Metrology and Quality ControlInternational audienceAdhesive bonding for {{industrial}} purposes has, {{over the last}} years, become more important compared to conventional joining methods, due to application in miniaturized systems where other ways of joining are too bulky. These days’ industries {{have to deal with}} the challenge of applying adhesive bonds with small tolerances, while the geometrical dimensions of the applied adhesives change due to the curing process of the bond. This effect is called ‘adhesive shrinkage’. This paper explains the effects of adhesive shrinkage, during bonding processes, on internal bond stress and the influences on position accuracy of the adherent parts. Effect of parameters like curing time, gap size between components and adhesive volume are studied. This is done by use of a test setup containing a manipulator with force sensor to simulate an industrial setup for the application of similar adhesive bonds. Results show that the gap-size has influence on shrinkage behaviour, whereas the adhesive volume, which defines the cross section area of the bond, is less important. Results can be used to develop a bonding procedure, which leads to an optimal balance between position accuracy and bond stress, thus guaranteeing a reliable and accurate <b>bond</b> in industrial <b>manufacturing</b> environments...|$|R
