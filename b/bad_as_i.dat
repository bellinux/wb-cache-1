Shortly after, Rodman famously wore a wedding dress to promote his autobiography <b>Bad</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> Wanna Be, claiming that he was bisexual {{and that he was}} marrying himself.|$|E
500|$|This {{species is}} often listed in field guides as inedible, or not {{recommended}} for consumption due to its tough texture. Michael Kuo, in his 2007 book on edible mushrooms, lists the taste as [...] "mediocre", and comments [...] "the devil's urn is not as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{thought it was going}} to be. It's not good, mind you, but it would be possible to eat it with a forced smile if your Aunt Wanda served it to you." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{his father}} left, Shirley took many odd jobs {{to support the}} family, up to four at the same time. In his 1997 {{biography}} <b>Bad</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> Wanna Be, he expresses his feelings for his father: [...] "I haven't seen my father in more than 30 years, so what's there to miss... I {{just look at it}} like this: Some man brought me into this world. That doesn't mean I have a father". (He would not meet his father again until 2012.) ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No;--I was not {{thinking}} of Tifto. There were one or two here who were quite <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> Tifto. <b>I</b> wonder what has become of that poor devil?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Keller {{supplied}} the information, {{and the other}} looked thoughtful. [...] "Didn't know it was quite so <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> that. <b>I</b> allow I'd better not let him have the goods." ...|$|R
500|$|Rodman {{experienced}} a tough loss when coach Chuck Daly, {{whom he had}} admired as a surrogate father, resigned in May; Rodman skipped the preseason camp and was fined $68,000. The following 1992–1993 season was even more tumultuous. Rodman and Annie Bakes, {{the mother of his}} daughter Alexis, were divorcing after a short marriage, an experience which left him traumatized. The Pistons won only 40games and missed the 1993 NBA Playoffs entirely. One night in February 1993, Rodman was found asleep in his car with a loaded rifle. Four years later in his biography As <b>Bad</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> Wanna Be, he confessed having thought about suicide and described that night as an epiphany: [...] "I decided that instead [...] I was gonna kill the impostor that was leading Dennis Rodman to a place he didn't want to go... So I just said, 'I'm going to live my life the way I want to live it and be happy doing it.' At that moment I tamed [...] my whole life around. I killed the person I didn't want to be." [...] The book was later adapted for a TV movie <b>Bad</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> Wanna Be: The Dennis Rodman Story. Although he had three years and $11.8million remaining on his contract, Rodman demanded a trade. On October 1, 1993, the Pistons dealt him to the San Antonio Spurs.|$|E
500|$|Rodman {{experienced}} an unhappy childhood and was shy and introverted {{in his early}} years. After aborting a suicide attempt in 1993, he reinvented himself as a [...] "bad boy" [...] and became notorious for numerous controversial antics. He repeatedly dyed his hair in artificial colors, had many piercings and tattoos, and regularly disrupted games by clashing with opposing players and officials. He famously wore a wedding dress to promote his 1996 autobiography <b>Bad</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> Wanna Be. Rodman pursued a high-profile affair with singer Madonna and was briefly married to actress Carmen Electra. Rodman also attracted international attention for his visits to North Korea and his subsequent befriending of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Afterwards, Coppell said: [...] "I didn't {{feel too}} <b>bad,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{appreciated}} {{being in the}} FA Cup final at all. It was only afterwards I realised {{it might have been}} the only chance I'd ever get. But the next season gave me another go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘O, not so <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> that!’ <b>I</b> cried. ‘Come, come, you exaggerate, my dear Miss—? Excuse me if I am too familiar: I {{have not}} yet heard your name.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{quite so}} <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> that, <b>I</b> hope," [...] said Dick, {{who was very}} {{slightly}} singed, and forgot his own hurts in anxiety about his comrade. [...] "Let me see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Jack {{has made}} you nearly <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> himself! <b>I</b> want to, of course. I'm tired of {{everything}} and everybody, from a moonlight picnic at Seepee to the blandishments of The Mussuck.' ...|$|R
2500|$|RUTH: Yes, sir, I were; I {{were brought}} {{up to be a}} thief. Every soul as I knowed was a thief, and the best thief was the best thought on. Maybe a kid not long born ought to have knowed better. I dunno, I must ha' been born bad, for it seemed right enough to me. Well, it was in prison and out o' prison—three months here and six months there—till I was sixteen. I {{sometimes}} thinks as if they'd bin half as ready to show me how to go right as they was to punish me for goin' wrong, I might have took the right turnin' and stuck to it afore this. At sixteen I got seven-year for shop-liftin', and was sent out to Port Phillip. I soon got a ticket and tried service and needlework, but no one wouldn't have me; and I got sick and tired of it all, and began to think o' putting an end to it, when I met a smooth-spoken chap—a gentleman, if you please—as wanted to save me from the danger afore me. Well, wot odds? He was a psalm-singing villain, and he soon left me. No need to tell the rest—to such as you it can't be told. I'm 'most as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can be—as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can be! ...|$|E
2500|$|... "As <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{have been}} represented, or {{as bad as}} you may think me, I assure you that I feel support in my afflictions from {{entertaining}} a proper sense of religion. [...] As all men are subject to wrong, I cannot but say that the principle is likewise inherent in me. [...] I acknowledge myself guilty in regard of many of my slaves, but I call God to witness to my innocence in respect to the murder of Prosper. [...] I am sensible that the country thirsts for my blood, and I am ready to sacrifice it." ...|$|E
2500|$|His perfectionism was legendary; however, his {{relentless}} {{insistence on}} rehearsals and retakes was {{a burden to}} some. When time approached for the shooting of a number, Astaire would rehearse for another two weeks and record the singing and music. With all the preparation completed, the actual shooting would go quickly, conserving costs. Astaire agonized during the entire process, frequently asking colleagues for acceptance for his work. As Vincente Minnelli stated, [...] "He lacks confidence to the most enormous degree {{of all the people}} in the world. He will not even go to see his rushes... He always thinks he is no good." [...] As Astaire himself observed, [...] "I've never yet got anything 100% right. Still it's never as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> think it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, not so <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> that, <b>I</b> hope," [...] {{said the}} host; and Lapham looked {{from one to}} the other, trying to make out what they were at. He had never been so up a tree before.|$|R
6000|$|THE NEWSPAPER MAN [interested] <b>Is</b> he <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> that? <b>I</b> say: I am in luck to-day. Would {{you mind}} letting me {{photograph}} you? [He produces a camera]. Could {{you have a}} lancet or something in your hand? ...|$|R
6000|$|THE OLD WOMAN. A murderer! Oh, {{how dare}} they {{send me to}} herd with murderers! <b>I</b> was not <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> that: <b>I</b> was a good woman. There is some mistake: where can I have it set right? ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'You {{might have}} gone farther off,' I said, {{brightening}} a little, 'and been <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> lost. <b>I</b> shall see you sometimes, my dear old Peggotty, there. You won't be quite {{at the other end}} of the world, will you?' ...|$|R

6000|$|Martin {{feels as}} <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> do at Tony's death, tho he doesn't say much of anything. [...] "Gosh, and Tony {{such a nice}} little cuss," [...] was about all he said, but he looked white around the gills.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know why}} it is," [...] says Goodall, of Memphis, [...] "but I don't feel as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> did. An hour ago I wanted to die, but since I've met you, Miss Rosa, I'd like so much to live." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ouh! Reomeo, Reomeo. Wherefore {{art thou}} Reomeo?" [...] said McTurk over his shoulder, quoting the Shakespeare artiste of last term. [...] "Well, he won't be <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> her, <b>I</b> hope. Stalky, are you {{properly}} patriotic? Because if you ain't, this chap's goin' to make you." ...|$|R
