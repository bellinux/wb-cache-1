5|$|At {{first it}} always bothers you {{even though you}} say it doesn't. But I think {{if you want to}} exceed limits, you have to suck that all in and be happy with what you have. At first it was painful to watch all those things <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> take it as {{constructive}} criticism or I don't bother to look at it.|$|E
5|$|<b>But</b> <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> {{no longer}} pleaded for anything. I {{was no longer}} able to lament. On the contrary, I felt very strong. I was the accuser, God the accused. My eyes had opened and I was alone, terribly alone in a world without God, without man. Without love or mercy.|$|E

25|$|I do {{not know}} how many men I saw, but {{certainly}} during this one march not less than 5,000. Of this great number two only offered insults to the gang of prisoners....But little and petty as it was it galled horribly. The soldiers felt the sting and scowled back; the officers looked straight before them. Yet it was a valuable lesson. Only a few days before I had read in the newspapers of how the Kaffirs had jeered at the Boer prisoners when they were marched into Pietermaritzburg, saying, 'Where are your passes?' It had seemed a very harmless joke then, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> understood how a prisoner feels these things.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

500|$|Prost's Jean Alesi {{was passed}} {{fit in the}} days leading up to the race. At the {{previous}} race, Alesi had suffered a serious crash which involved a collision with Sauber driver Pedro Diniz, although he escaped uninjured apart from abdominal pains and suffered from dizziness and vomiting. Prost had their test driver Stéphane Sarrazin ready to replace Alesi should the latter had suffered a relapse. Alesi said he felt ready to race again: [...] "It took a few days before I really started to recover, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> sleep and feel much better".|$|E

[...] Foraker felt {{relieved}} at the break, writing to a friend, [...] "From Toledo to Chicago, my neck was under a yoke, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> am free." [...] Despite the factional opposition, he sought a third term in 1889, hoping that if Republicans kept their majority in the legislature, he could be elected to the Senate as Sherman's junior colleague in the legislative election {{to be held in}} January 1890.

[...] Apart from friction with the director, Ford also disliked the voiceovers: [...] "When we started shooting it had been tacitly agreed that the version of the film that we had agreed upon was the version without voiceover narration. It was a [...] nightmare. I thought that the film had worked without the narration. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> was stuck re-creating that narration.

500|$|In 2002, Thompson starred {{alongside}} John Lynch, Geraldine Somerville, Lauren Cook and John Thomson in the Jim Doyle-directed film Re-Inventing Eddie. The {{movie is}} about a man named Eddie (Lynch), who is hounded by social services and branded a paedophile after an innocent bathtime game with his children is taken out of context. About two years later and shortly before entering teenagehood, Thompson successfully auditioned to feature in the BBC children's comedy programme Stupid!.

Upon his departure, Mendes was critical of the club's president João Bartolomeu, who he believed created instability at the club.
