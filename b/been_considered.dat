5|$|Ajtony's {{ethnicity}} is debated. Historian Paul Stephenson {{described him}} as a Magyar chieftain; according to historian László Makkai, he was of Kabar origin and his Turkic name may imply {{that he was a}} Pecheneg. In Romanian historiography, Ajtony has <b>been</b> <b>considered</b> the last member of a Romanian dynasty descended from Glad; historian Alexandru Madgearu wrote that the Latin name of Ajtony's seat (urbs Morisena) preserved a Romanian form.|$|E

5|$|Among myriapods, millipedes have {{traditionally}} <b>been</b> <b>considered</b> most {{closely related to}} the tiny pauropods, although some molecular studies challenge this relationship. Millipedes can be distinguished from the somewhat similar but only distantly related centipedes (class Chilopoda), which move rapidly, are carnivorous, and have only a single pair of legs on each body segment. The scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology, and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist.|$|E

5|$|An {{acclaimed}} literary work, The Elegance of the Hedgehog has <b>been</b> <b>considered</b> {{by critics}} and press alike as a publishing phenomenon.

The novel has earned Barbery the 2007 French Booksellers Prize, the 2007 Brive-la-Gaillarde Reader's Prize, and the Prix du Rotary International in France. The Elegance of the Hedgehog has been adapted into the film Le hérisson (2009).|$|E
5|$|Apatosaurus grandis {{was named}} in 1877 by Marsh {{in the article}} that {{described}} A.ajax. It was briefly described, figured, and diagnosed. Marsh later mentioned it was only provisionally assigned to Apatosaurus when he reassigned it to his new genus Morosaurus in 1878. Since Morosaurus has <b>been</b> <b>considered</b> a synonym of Camarasaurus, C.grandis is the oldest-named species of the latter genus.|$|E

5|$|Based on morphology, John McEachran and Neil Aschliman {{determined}} in a 2004 phylogenetic study that Platyrhinoidis and Platyrhina together form the most basal clade {{of the order}} Myliobatiformes, and are thus the sister group to all {{other members of the}} order (encompassing stingrays and their relatives). This finding affirmed that the thornback guitarfish is not closely related to the true guitarfishes of the family Rhinobatidae, a possibility that had long <b>been</b> <b>considered</b> by taxonomists.|$|E
5|$|Bromine has {{sometimes}} <b>been</b> <b>considered</b> to be possibly essential in humans, {{but this is}} supported by only limited circumstantial evidence, and no clear biological role. As a pharmaceutical, the simple bromide ion (Br−) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as antiepileptics.|$|E
5|$|But by April 2009, 20th Century Fox {{confirmed}} that the sequel was already in development and announced that Oliver Stone would direct. In addition, Shia LaBeouf was cast with Josh Brolin.
