25|$|The optimal way {{to store}} {{deuterium}} in a reasonably dense state is to chemically bond it with lithium, as lithium deuteride.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringKyle RidingThe {{durability}} of partial depth concrete repair {{is directly related}} to the bond strength between the repair material and existing concrete. The wait time effects of cementitous grouts, epoxy, acrylic latex, and polyvinyl acetate <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> were observed on bond strength. Three rapid repair materials were as a comparison to bond strength, as well as concrete samples with no <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> having dry conditions and saturated surface dry moisture condition. The <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> and rapid repair materials were tested in a controlled laboratory environment. Bond strength loss with wait times of 0, 2, 5, 10, and 30 minutes were observed when <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> were applied. The laboratory samples were loaded using a direct shear test. Field tests were performed using the same repair materials and <b>bonding</b> <b>agents.</b> When the agents were applied in the field the wait times used were 0, 15, 30, and 45 minutes. 7 day and 5 month pull off tensile tests were performed during the field experiment. The data from both experiments show that when using cement grout <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> the high <b>bond</b> strength can be obtained when the repair material is applied within 15 minutes of application of the cement grout, and after 15 minutes bond loss can be expected. Wait time didn't have a significant effect on epoxy and acrylic latex <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> as long as they were placed before setting. The polyvinyl acetate agent and repair materials can develop high bond strength in laboratory settings, but when used in the field the bond strengths experience loss.

Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical de-smear process, or by plasma-etch.

The teeth were divided into five groups of 10 teeth each and 20 cavity preparations per group.

Results : This study showed that at the coronal margin and the apical margins, the preparations treated with Clearfil S 3 showed significantly less leakage than the other groups.
