5|$|Other proffered {{explanations}} are the possible {{appearance of a}} displaced iceberg; the fear of running aground while <b>becalmed,</b> and a sudden seaquake. Hydrographical evidence suggests that an iceberg drifting so far south was improbable, and had it done so other ships would have seen it. Begg gives more consideration to a theory that Mary Celeste, while <b>becalmed,</b> began drifting towards the Dollabarat reef off Santa Maria Island. The theory supposes that Briggs, fearing his ship would run aground, launched the yawl {{in the hope of}} reaching land. The wind could then have picked up and blown Mary Celeste away from the reef, while the rising seas swamped and sank the yawl. The weakness of this theory is that if the ship had been <b>becalmed,</b> all sails would have been set to catch any available breeze, yet the ship was found with many of its sails furled.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} {{initially}} frustrated by light winds, but by 14:25 Blonde and Thetis were {{within range of}} the gun batteries and fifteen minutes later {{they were able to}} open fire on the flûtes, although still at quite a distance. <b>Becalmed</b> in the bay, Blonde was forced to engage one of the forts instead, fire from the shore causing some damage but not enough to endanger the ship. Thetis was luckier, and Captain Miller was able to close with one of the French ships, although their identities during the engagement are uncertain in historical accounts and it is not clear which one was first into the action. By 15:35, Thetis had dismasted her opponent, which surrendered. Moving against the second ship, Thetis was then also <b>becalmed</b> and was forced to engage the forts instead. As Sceptre led the remainder of the squadron into the bay, fire was seen spreading through the surrendered ship and, in the face of overwhelming opposition, the second flûte also surrendered at 16:20.|$|E
5|$|Concurrently {{with the}} War of Knives, the United States and France {{were engaged in}} a bout of limited naval warfare in the Caribbean as part of the Quasi-War. In late December 1799 the American armed {{schooner}} Experiment was escorting under convoy the brig Daniel and Mary and the schooners Sea Flower, Mary, and Washington to prevent their capture by French privateers. On 1 January 1800, the convoy was caught in a dead calm off {{the north side of the}} present-day Haitian island of Gonâve, in the Bight of Leogane. Seeing the convoy <b>becalmed,</b> Rigaud sent eleven armed barges out to attack and seize the American vessels.|$|E
5|$|Temeraires one {{brush with}} the French {{during this period}} came on 13 August 1811. Having {{received}} orders to sail to Menorca, Spear attempted to tack out of Hyères Bay. As {{he tried to do}} so, the wind fell away, leaving Temeraire <b>becalmed</b> and caught in a current which caused her to drift towards land. She came under fire from a shore battery on Pointe des Medes, which wounded several of her crew. Her boats were quickly manned, and together with boats sent from the squadron, Temeraire was towed out of range of the French guns. She then sailed to Menorca and underwent repairs. During this period an epidemic of yellow fever broke out, infecting nearly the entire crew and killing around a hundred crewmen. Pellew ordered her back to Britain, and health gradually improved as she sailed through the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} forms of sailing ships, but they all have certain basic things in common. Except for rotor ships using the Magnus effect, every sailing ship has a hull, rigging {{and at least one}} mast to hold up the sails that use the wind to power the ship. Ocean journeys by sailing ship can take many months, and a common hazard is becoming <b>becalmed</b> because of lack of wind, or being blown off course by severe storms or winds that do not allow progress in the desired direction. A severe storm could lead to shipwreck, and the loss of all hands. Sailing ships can only carry a certain quantity of supplies in their hold, so they have to plan long voyages carefully to include appropriate provisions, including fresh water.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it was not}} {{immediately}} obvious to the men on Bellone, the new arrival was Plampin's Powerful, which had arrived in Indian waters on 13 June 1806. Finding no trace of Willaumez, who had elected {{to remain in the}} Atlantic, Plampin briefly anchored at Madras and subsequently cruised off Ceylon. There, following intelligence sent by Pellew, he captured the 20-gun French privateer Henriette near Trincomalee after an 11-hour chase. From information possibly supplied by prisoners removed from Henriette or possibly from a merchant ship sailing from Colombo, Plampin learned of Perroud's operations and had arranged to meet Rattlesnake off the Little Basses Reef. In the hope of luring the privateer into a confrontation, he disguised his large warship to look like an East Indiaman. Perroud rapidly saw through the disguise, and also noticed that while the wind remained strong off the coast, Powerful was further out to sea and appeared <b>becalmed.</b> Realising that his only option was to sail between Powerful and the shore, Perroud turned eastwards, but the wind gradually strengthened for Powerful and by 17:00 the ship of the line was within range of Bellone with her bow chasers.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} Cadiz, Linois {{had learned from}} {{the crew of the}} {{captured}} brig HMS Speedy that a powerful British squadron of seven ships of the line under Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez lay off Cadiz, blockading the port. Concerned that this squadron could overwhelm his own, Linois took shelter in the small but well-defended harbour of Algeciras, just across Algeciras Bay from the heavily fortified British naval base at Gibraltar. Saumarez was informed of Linois's arrival, and turned eastwards to confront him, discovering the French ships anchored in a well prepared position on the morning of 6 July. Saumarez attacked immediately, but found that his ships were hampered by a lack of wind. <b>Becalmed</b> under heavy fire, the British squadron inflicted severe damage on the French ships which withdrew into shallower water, two grounding. However, when Saumarez ordered his ships to follow, HMS Hannibal grounded as well, trapped under a heavy barrage from the shore. With no wind with which to manoeuvre and the squadron's boats all either sunk or engaged in towing the battered HMS Pompée back to Gibraltar, Saumarez called off the attack at 13:35. The battered British squadron retired to Gibraltar, except for Hannibal, which was trapped, battered and swiftly forced to surrender, having lost two masts and more than 140 men.|$|E
5|$|In 1771 his Synopsis of Quadrupeds was published; {{a second}} edition was {{expanded}} into a History of Quadrupeds. At {{the end of}} that same year, 1771, he published A Tour in Scotland in 1769. This proved so popular that he decided to undertake another journey and in the summer of 1772, set out from Chester with two companions, the Rev. John Lightfoot, a naturalist, and Rev. J. Stewart, a Scotsman knowledgeable in the customs of the country. They travelled through the Lake District, Carlisle, Eskdale, which Pennant much admired, Dumfries and Glasgow. In passing, he was fascinated by the account of the inundation of the surrounding farmland by a bursting out of the Solway Moss peatbog. The party set sail in a ninety-ton cutter from Greenock to explore the outer isles. They first visited Bute and Arran and then continued to Ailsa Craig. Pennant was interested in the birds, frogs and molluscs and considered their distribution. The boat then rounded the Mull of Kintyre and continued to Gigha. They would have continued to Islay but were <b>becalmed.</b> During this enforced idleness, the ever-industrious Pennant started on his ancient history of the Hebrides. When the wind picked up they continued to Jura.|$|E
5|$|Saumarez {{ordered his}} squadron's boats to assist Hannibal and Pompée, {{both of which}} were trapped under heavy fire and unable to {{effectively}} respond. As he did so, Linois ordered his ships to cut their anchor cables and drift into the shallows, away from the <b>becalmed</b> British squadron. Formidable successfully completed the manoeuvre, but both Desaix and Indomptable grounded inshore, where they were exposed to heavy fire from Saumarez's ships, which had also cut their cables in an effort to close with their opponents. At 13:35 however, Saumarez recognised that his squadron was in danger of grounding directly under the fire of the Spanish batteries. With the squadron's boats either sunk or employed towing Pompée back to Gibraltar, there was no possibility of launching an amphibious operation against the Spanish forts and Saumarez reluctantly called the attack off, the remainder of the squadron retiring to Gibratar but leaving the stranded Hannibal in the Bay of Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|The Second Battle of Algeciras (also {{known as}} the Battle of the Gut of Gibraltar) was a naval battle fought {{on the night of}} 12 July 1801 (23 messidor an IX of the French Republican Calendar) between a {{squadron}} of British Royal Navy ships of the line and a larger squadron of ships from the Spanish Navy and French Navy in the Gut of Gibraltar. The battle followed closely the First Battle of Algeciras on 6 July, in which a French squadron anchored at the Spanish port of Algeciras was attacked by a larger British squadron based at nearby Gibraltar. In a heavy engagement fought in calm weather in the close confines of Algeciras Bay, the British force had been <b>becalmed</b> and battered, suffering heavy casualties and losing the 74-gun ship HMS Hannibal. Retiring for repairs, both sides called up reinforcements, the French receiving support first, from the Spanish fleet based at Cadiz, which sent six ships of the line to escort the French squadron to safety.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of this engagement, the trapped Pompée and Hannibal were under heavy fire from the {{anchored}} Formidable {{and an array of}} Spanish batteries and gunboats, both ships taking severe damage without being able to effectively reply as their main broadsides now faced away from the enemy. On Hannibal the situation seemed hopeless: as casualties mounted, the main and mizen masts were shot away and the ship remained firmly and irretrievably grounded. Pompée was in a slightly better position: Sterling's rigging was in tatters, but his masts held and his ship was at least afloat, although totally <b>becalmed.</b> At one stage, Pompées colours were shot away, leading to French claims that the ship had surrendered, although they were quickly replaced. At 11:30, no longer able to contribute to the battle with rigging torn and more than 70 casualties, Saumarez ordered the remainder of the squadron to send their remaining boats to tow Pompée out of danger, the boats coming under heavy fire as they did so, with a number sunk.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Isle de France {{marked the}} end of the active British {{campaign}} and saw six frigates and over 200 cannon fall into British hands, in addition to the island itself, which was returned to its original Dutch name of Mauritius, and has been known as such ever since. The island remained under British control until granted independence in 1968. The British forces in the region were scaled back, command passing to Beaver, who sent ships to eliminate French ports on Madagascar and in the Seychelles. Due to the length of time it took for communications to travel between the Indian Ocean and Europe however, the French government were still unaware of the fall of the island in February 1811, when a squadron of reinforcements under François Roquebert, with the supplies needed to repair Hamelin's squadron, was despatched to the Indian Ocean. The squadron arrived on 6 May and was almost brought to battle by a British force off Grand Port, before escaping into the western Indian Ocean. Stopping at Tamatave on Madagascar, the French squadron was caught by a British force under Captain Charles Marsh Schomberg on 20 May and defeated. The Battle of Tamatave was characterised by very light winds, which left the combatants <b>becalmed</b> for much of the day, engaging in periodic fighting as the breeze increased.|$|E
25|$|On 15 June 1805, while Cameleon {{was lying}} <b>becalmed,</b> a {{flotilla}} of Spanish gunboats approached. However, when Cameleon got out her sweeps and a breeze sprang up they withdrew.|$|E
25|$|On July 12, Hudson {{returned}} to Nootka Sound with the Princess Royal. He {{did not intend}} to enter but was <b>becalmed.</b> This was seen as a provocation and he was seized by the Spanish.|$|E
25|$|The date line is {{a central}} factor in Umberto Eco's book The Island of the Day Before (1994), in which the protagonist finds himself on a <b>becalmed</b> ship, with an island close at hand {{on the other side}} of the IDL. Unable to swim, the protagonist indulges in {{increasingly}} confused speculation regarding the physical, metaphysical and religious import of the date line.|$|E
25|$|The next {{sighting}} {{between any}} of the participants was on 9 August, when Taeping and Fiery Cross exchanged signals some 12° north of the Equator, in the Atlantic. Winds were light and variable, so they remained in company until 27 August, when a breeze sprang up which carried Taeping {{out of sight in}} four or five hours, whilst Fiery Cross suffered the enormous misfortune to remain <b>becalmed</b> for another 24 hours.|$|E
25|$|Some {{two weeks}} later, on 13 October, Milbrook engaged a French {{privateer}} in a notable but ultimately indecisive action. Milbrook was lying <b>becalmed</b> off Oporto when she sighted a strange sail, apparently a French 36-gun frigate. Smith was escorting two brigs of the Newfoundland fleet {{and there were}} other vessels, possibly of that fleet, in the offing. To protect the merchantmen Milbrook sailed to intercept the enemy vessel.|$|E
25|$|Collin's party {{arrived on}} the Derwent River on 16 February 1804, and {{immediately}} became <b>becalmed</b> in Storm Bay. Collin's dispatched troops to row ashore off what is now Rokeby to march overland to the camp at Risdon and announce their arrival. The party found navigating the thick Australian bushland hard-going, but did gain useful intelligence as {{the nature of the}} area. In the end, they only arrived shortly before the ships were able to navigate up-river.|$|E
25|$|On 4 March 1827 Zebra became <b>becalmed</b> off Zea. While there, she {{observed}} two boats full of men leaving the island. Zebra sent her own boats in pursuit. One boat ran ashore {{and all but}} four men fled ashore; the British then burned it. The following night as Zebra sailed through the Doro Passage, five boats harried her, firing on her. They then disappeared into the dark when Zebra tried to bring her guns to bear.|$|E
25|$|Layman {{only had}} time to make changes to Ravens armament. He closed the two {{foremost}} ports and replaced their guns with a single 68-pounder carronade that he mounted on a traverse carriage (i.e., pivot-mounted) immediately before the foremast {{in a way that}} it could fire over the gunwales. Similarly, a second 68-pounder, also mounted on a traverse, replaced the two stern chasers. Should gunboats threaten a <b>becalmed</b> Raven, she could present a powerful response on any azimuth.|$|E
25|$|Najaden had a slab-sided {{hull and}} the typical Hohlenberg pinkie stern, with {{a place for}} two stern chaser guns. Gardiner {{suggests}} that the pinkie stern and increased tumblehome towards the stern permitted the vessel to fire over the quarters. Naval warfare in the Baltic made extensive use of oared gunboats, which would fire on <b>becalmed</b> vessels from the quarter, an angle that normally broadside guns could not cover. The pinkie stern was unpopular with the British, who removed it when they refitted her.|$|E
25|$|Bouchard {{decided to}} chase the frigate, which they found <b>becalmed.</b> He ordered Sheppard to take a rowboat to ask the frigate's {{commander}} {{for information about the}} ship in the Hawaiian harbor. Sheppard found out that it was the Santa Rosa or the Chacabuco, a corvette that had weighed anchor at Buenos Aires almost the same day the La Argentina had. The crew of Santa Rosa had mutinied near Chile's coast and headed to Hawaii, where the crew had attempted to sell the vessel to the Hawaiian king.|$|E
25|$|Entreprenante {{found herself}} <b>becalmed</b> off the Spanish coast near Castle Ferro, between Málaga and Cape De Gatt {{on the morning}} of 12 December 1810. Whilst she was lying there, four French lateen-rigged privateers came out to attack her. One of the French vessels had eight guns, {{including}} two long 18-pounder guns, and 75 men. The second had five guns and a crew of 45 men. The last two each had two guns and crews of 25 men. Entreprenante was short-handed, having on board only 33 men.|$|E
25|$|One month later, Knight {{wrote that}} Gleaner had {{captured}} the French privateer Adelaide some six leagues WNW of Cape St Vito (Sicily). While both vessels were lying <b>becalmed,</b> the privateer used her sweeps {{to bring her}} into position to attack Gleaner. Adelaide was armed with six guns and had a crew of 46 men. Nevertheless, she struck to Gleaner. Adelaide was five days out of Naples and had taken nothing. Knight's letter was dated at Plymouth on 6 May, suggesting that Gleaner {{had been in the}} Mediterranean carrying dispatches, and then returned.|$|E
25|$|The Register of Shipping for 1813 shows Hebes master as W. Brigham, and her {{trade as}} London—Malta, {{changing}} to London−Hayti. On 25 July 1812 Hebe left Malta for Smyrna in company with Scipio, James Silk Buckingham, master. The next day, {{while in the}} Archipelago, they became <b>becalmed,</b> with Hebe some three miles from Scipio, {{too far away to}} render assistance when two Greek pirate vessels attacked Scipio. Scipio was able to repel the attack, sinking one pirate vessel and causing great casualties amongst her attackers, without having any men killed, though half her crew of 25 were wounded.|$|E
25|$|Artemis punished Agamemnon {{after he}} killed a sacred stag in a sacred grove and boasted {{that he was}} a better hunter than the goddess. When the Greek fleet was {{preparing}} at Aulis to depart for Troy to begin the Trojan War, Artemis <b>becalmed</b> the winds. The seer Calchas advised Agamemnon {{that the only way to}} appease Artemis was to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia. Artemis then snatched Iphigenia from the altar and substituted a deer. Various myths have been told about what happened after Artemis took her. Either she was brought to Tauros and led the priests there or became Artemis' immortal companion.|$|E
25|$|The English ships {{except in}} the rigging and masts had {{sustained}} only little damage, since the Spanish aim was to board and overpower. None of this was achieved as the English fire or the rough sea, depending on sources, had been strong enough not to allow the Spanish galleys into grappling position. The English casualties were only light at best but soon the wind had died down and therefore were <b>becalmed</b> just before Gibraltar itself. They were {{in desperate need of}} shot and powder as most of the bigger ships were close to being out of ammunition {{by the end of the}} action.|$|E
25|$|On 7 May, {{while trying}} to lure the {{corvette}} towards Belle Île Vincejo drove a sloop ashore between Saint Gilda and Saint Jacques, Sarzou. In the morning of 8 May Vincejo found herself <b>becalmed</b> while the tide carried her towards the Teigneuse Rock. As Wright was attempting to warp her out to the channel, he observed that a flotilla of gunboats had come out from the Morbihan and was approaching Vincejo. The gunboats started firing {{as soon as they}} were in range and continued firing as they approached. Vincejo crew alternated between manning the larboard guns and the starboard sweeps, leaving them exhausted.|$|E
25|$|In 1609, Argall, as an English ship's captain {{employed}} by the Virginia Company of London, {{was the first to}} develop a shorter, more northerly route for sailing from England across the Atlantic Ocean to the Virginia Colony and its primary port and seat of government at Jamestown. Rather than following the normal practice of going south to the tropics and west with the trade winds, Captain Argall sailed west from the Azores to Bermuda and then almost due west to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. His voyage took only nine weeks and six days, including two weeks <b>becalmed.</b> This new route enabled the English to avoid enemy Spanish ships and to save on provisions.|$|E
25|$|Artemis played quite a {{large part}} in this war. Like her mother and brother, who was widely worshipped at Troy, Artemis took {{the side of the}} Trojans. At the Greek's journey to Troy, Artemis <b>becalmed</b> the sea and stopped the journey until an oracle came and said they could win the goddess' heart by sacrificing Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter. Agamemnon once promised the goddess he would {{sacrifice}} the dearest thing to him, which was Iphigenia, but broke that promise. Other sources said he boasted about his hunting ability and provoked the goddess' anger. Artemis saved Iphigenia because of her bravery. In some versions of the myth, Artemis made Iphigenia her attendant or turned her into Hecate, goddess of night, witchcraft, and the underworld.|$|E
25|$|On 1 May 1810, Success and Spartan {{pursued a}} French squadron, {{consisting}} of the 42-gun frigate Ceres, 28-gun corvette Fame, 8-gun brig Sparviere and the 10-gun cutter Achilles. The French managed to take shelter in the harbour of Naples, and Captain Brenton of Spartan, realising they would never come out while the two British ships were there, ordered Success to a point south-west of Capri. At dawn on 3 May Brenton observed the French coming out, accompanied by eight Neapolitan gun-boats, and in a hard-fought action succeeded in boarding and capturing the brig Sparviere, and causing severe damage to the other ships. Success was unable to play any part in the action being <b>becalmed</b> offshore. On 26 June Success and , captured another ship, the Fortune.|$|E
25|$|They {{were also}} {{critical}} of the races on water weather forecasting, which during the three days of storm, did not alter its forecast for a following SE wind change, which never eventuated. But probably lured yachts further south and away from Tasmania than necessary before tacking due west to close the coast. Sea-U-Later along with other yachts tracked down the 151-degree east longitude, becoming <b>becalmed</b> for 20 hours around 42 degrees south, in {{the centre of the}} weakened low, that all weather reports had said had moved well into the Tasman Sea. Whilst a respite the delay cost them dearly, Sea-U-Later was 37th to complete the race. The official explanation of the meteorology during the period was in the same edition, but somehow this was not communicated to yachts at sea at the time.|$|E
25|$|In 1880 an {{incident}} occurred on board {{during which the}} First Mate Sidney Smith killed seaman John Francis. Smith was allowed to leave the ship at Anjer by Captain Wallace, causing the crew to cease work in protest. Wallace continued the voyage with six apprentices and four tradesmen but became <b>becalmed</b> in the Java Sea for three days. In desperation as matters moved from bad to worse, he committed suicide by jumping overboard and disappeared. He was replaced as Master by William Bruce, who {{proved to be a}} drunken incompetent who claimed pay for non-existent crewmen and managed to set sail with inadequate provisions, resulting in the crew starving. An inquiry in New York in April 1882 resulted in the captain and mate being suspended and replaced by Captain Moore, previously of Blackadder.|$|E
25|$|Henrik Horn was {{appointed}} commander-in-chief of the Swedish navy in March 1677, becoming {{the third consecutive}} navy chief (after Gustaf Otto Stenbock and Lorentz Creutz) without any naval experience. The Danish fleet, on the other hand, was well-staffed with capable, experienced officers, which placed the Swedes at a marked disadvantage from the outset. Horn was quickly informed that Dutch reinforcements under Tromp were heading for the Baltic, and on 21 April he was received orders from King Charles to join {{the main body of}} the Swedish fleet with a minor squadron anchored off Gothenburg under the command of Erik Sjöblad. The main fleet did not get to see until early June, but Sjöblad nevertheless sailed as early as 20 May to join Horn. Sjöblad tried to sail through the Great Belt, but was <b>becalmed</b> for on the 23rd and did not pass Langeland until the 29th.|$|E
25|$|On 28 June, the {{squadron}} off Môle-Saint-Nicolas sighted two sails {{close to the}} Haitian shoreline and closed to investigate. These were revealed to be the French heavy 44-gun frigate Poursuivante under Captain Jean-Baptiste Philibert Willaumez and the 16-gun corvette Mignonne under Captain Jean-Pierre Bargeau. The French ships had sailed with a reduced armament from Les Cayes in southern Saint-Domingue on 26 June with orders to visit Môle-Saint-Nicolas before returning to France. On identifying the ships as French, the British squadron separated under orders from Bayntun, the senior captain. Captain Brisbane was instructed to chase Mignonne, Goliath rapidly closing {{the gap between the}} ships as they exchanged a few distant shot without effect. Mignonne was <b>becalmed</b> close inshore, and when it became apparent that his ship would be caught by the far larger Goliath, Captain Bargeau surrendered without either side having suffered any damage or casualties. Mignonne was later commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Mignonne.|$|E
25|$|Preparations {{were made}} to leave Garden Key. The {{salvaged}} sloop was repaired, and one periagua was lengthened and rigged as a schooner. On 19 March {{the crew of the}} Tyger boarded the sloop, the schooner rigged periagua, the yawl, the two other periaguas and the canoe, and set sail for Port Royal. The canoe capsized and sank after only two days, but its crew were rescued by one of the other boats. The little fleet rounded the western end of Cuba and reached the Cayman Islands in two weeks, but was then <b>becalmed</b> for three weeks. Captain Herbert then sent the schooner, which was a slow sailer, along the southern coast of Cuba, while the sloop towed the rest of the boats directly to Jamaica. After six days they reached the western end of Jamaica, where they were able to obtain water and supplies, but it took another three weeks to reach Port Royal.|$|E
