5|$|The very {{expensive}} project of 1910, costing Coandă about one million francs, {{left him with}} limited funds. The possibility of a new contract with the French government led Coandă to build the Coandă-1911. He wished to win an army-organised competition at Reims in October, one that required two engines in each aircraft as a fail-safe strategy. At the third aviation salon in Paris 1911, Coandă displayed a scale model of the aircraft which used two Gnome rotary engines mounted back to back, connected by a <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> to a single two-bladed propeller. The combination of two engines connected to one propeller was originally intended to drive a new turbine, but Coandă was unable to fund one. During trials the assembly did not provide enough traction and a four-bladed propeller was ordered. The mounting support of the engines, initially intended for a jet propulsion version, was not adequate for the new configuration so the forward chassis had to be modified.|$|E
500|$|Finally news of {{sightings}} filtered back to France {{and spread}} around Europe and the United States. As {{was reported in}} The New York Times the following day, the Patrie had been observed {{on the morning of}} Sunday, 1December 1907, over Cardigan (Wales). On the afternoon of the same day she made landfall at Ballysallagh, near Holywood, County Down in northern Ireland, where a propeller and <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> assembly were broken off (see photo). With the loss of this weight the Patrie once more ascended and was spotted by a Lloyd's signal station at Torr Head on the Antrim coast. The next sighting came soon after, over islands in St. Patrick's Channel, between Ireland and Scotland. The Patrie continued northwards, where the last sighting was reported by Captain Buchanan of the steamship Olivine at latitude 58°N near the Hebrides, [...] after which she was lost without a trace.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Bevel</b> <b>gears</b> {{are used}} as the main {{mechanism}} for a hand drill. As {{the handle of the}} drill is turned in a vertical direction, the <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> change the rotation of the chuck to a horizontal rotation. The <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> in a hand drill have the added advantage of increasing the speed of rotation of the chuck and this makes it possible to drill a range of materials.|$|R

2500|$|E.N.V. was {{an early}} {{manufacturer}} of aircraft engines, originally called the London and Parisian Motor Company their first model appearing in 1908. [...] E.N.V. engines were used by several pioneer aircraft builders and were produced in both France and the UK until about 1914.

2500|$|A key {{safety feature}} of the aircraft's main gear box (MGB) is an {{emergency}} oil spraying sub-system present in the lubrication system; this is designed to exceed the JAR 29 Standard's requirements of a 30-minute running time {{in the event of}} the loss of MGB oil pressure, and has demonstrated up to 50-minute running time. The engine also incorporates a [...] "blade shedding" [...] system to ensure engine integrity during an overspeed instance. Energy absorbent self-sealing fuel tanks are contained in the aircraft's sponsons, along with other equipment such as downward-facing illumination and navigation lighting fixtures. The transmission can accommodate more power than the maximum output of the engines; however two aircraft were lost in 2012 due to the cracking of the <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> shaft, a gearbox component. In response, the design of the transmission was modified in 2013, and the onboard health and usage monitoring system (HUMS) was upgraded to provide real-time monitoring of the <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> shaft against the threat of crack formation.|$|E

2500|$|Two magnetos were {{mounted on}} the outside of each {{cylinder}} bank.

[...] Each cylinder had two vertical inlet valves and a single vertical exhaust valve, all driven by rocking levers from the camshaft. [...] Four carburettors each fed four cylinders via a water jacketed manifold. Each cylinder exhausted into an individual pipe in the space between the cylinder blocks. The whole construction was protected by patents until 1935.|$|E
2500|$|Full-time Mode - Both axles {{are driven}} {{at all times}} but an {{inter-axle}} differential permits the axles to turn at different speeds as needed. This allows the vehicle to be driven ‘full-time’ in this mode, regardless of the road surface, without fear of driveline wind-up. With standard <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> differentials the torque split is 50:50. Planetary differentials can provide asymmetric torque splits as needed. A system that operates permanently in the full-time mode is sometimes called ‘All-the-Time 4WD’, 'All-Wheel-Drive' or ‘AWD’. If the inter-axle differential is locked out then the mode reverts to a ‘part-time mode’.|$|E
