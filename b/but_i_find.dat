500|$|The Wall was {{released}} in the UK and in the US on 30November 1979. Coinciding with its release, Waters was interviewed by veteran DJ Tommy Vance, who played the album in its entirety on BBC Radio 1. [...] Critical opinion of its content was mixed, ranging from The Village Voice critic Robert Christgau's [...] "a dumb tribulations-of-a-rock-star epic" [...] backed by [...] "kitschy minimal maximalism with sound effects and speech fragments", and Rolling Stone writer Kurt Loder's [...] "a stunning synthesis of Waters's by now familiar thematic obsessions", to Melody Makers [...] "I'm not sure whether it's brilliant or terrible, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> it utterly compelling." [...] Nevertheless, the album topped the Billboard charts for 15weeks, selling over a million copies in its first two months of sales and in 1999 was certified 23x platinum. [...] It {{remains one of the}} best-selling albums of all time in the US, between 1979 and 1990 selling over 19million copies worldwide.
