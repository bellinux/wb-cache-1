5|$|Yamashiro {{increased}} speed, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> hit by {{two to four}} torpedoes, {{and after}} two more torpedo hits near the starboard engine room, she was listing 45 degrees to port. Shinoda gave the command to abandon ship, but neither he nor Nishimura made any attempt to leave the conning tower as the ship capsized within five minutes and quickly sank, stern first, vanishing from radar between 04:19 and 04:21. Only 10 crewmembers of the estimated 1,636 officers and crew on board survived.|$|E
5|$|Linois {{had escaped}} so swiftly that his anchors and boats {{had been left}} in the bay, where he had {{abandoned}} them rather than draw attention to his movements by drawing them in. He had also just missed the transport Côte d'Or with its 326 soldiers, which arrived {{on the evening of}} 13 July and was swiftly surrounded by Centurion and Concorde. Detaching most of his squadron to Madras, Rainier waited off Pondicherry for further French movements and on 15 July spotted Belle Poule just off the coast. Linois had detached the frigate to investigate the anchorage at Madras, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> intercepted and followed by the frigate , whose insistent shadowing had forced Captain Alain-Adélaïde-Marie Bruilhac to return to Pondicherry. Belle Poule and Côte d'Or exchange signals during the morning, and at 11:00 the transport suddenly raised sails and departed the anchorage, Terpsichore pursuing closely. Early on 16 July, Terpsichore overtook the transport and fired several shots across her bow, forcing her captain to surrender. Bruilhac had used the distraction to sail Belle Poule to Isle de France without pursuit. Côte d'Or was returned to Pondicherry and, since there was no news of war from Europe, released on 24 July on condition that she only sail to Isle de France and no other destination. Dedaigneuse was detached to ensure that the transport followed these conditions and Rainier returned to Madras, joined by Dedaigneuse the following day once the transport's course was ensured. Rainier immediately ordered his ships to take on military supplies in preparation for military operations, although news of the declaration of war, made on 18 May, did not reach him until 13 September.|$|E

She lived with her mother Andrea (Cindy O'Callaghan) in Walford, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> closer to her father, Dave, and missed him terribly. Andrea favoured her other children, especially her older daughter Susie (Viva Duce), over Natalie. She was highly critical of Natalie and blamed her for the breakdown of her marriage (the unwanted pregnancy had ruined her figure and singing career, causing her husband to leave her). Andrea and Susie ridiculed Natalie for missing her father and wanting to keep in touch; Andrea claimed that Dave {{had no interest in}} Natalie.|$|E

500|$|Northrup {{filed for}} divorce on April 23, {{charging}} Hubbard with causing her [...] "extreme cruelty, great mental anguish and physical suffering". Her allegations produced more lurid headlines: not only was Hubbard accused of bigamy and kidnapping, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> subjected to [...] "systematic torture, including loss of sleep, beatings, and strangulations and scientific experiments". Because of his [...] "crazy misconduct" [...] she was in [...] "hourly fear of both the life of herself and of her infant daughter, who she has not seen for two months". She had consulted doctors who [...] "concluded that said Hubbard was hopelessly insane, and, crazy, {{and that there was}} no hope for said Hubbard, or any reason for her to endure further; that competent medical advisers recommended that said Hubbard be committed to a private sanatorium for psychiatric observation and treatment of a mental ailment known as paranoid schizophrenia." ...|$|E

500|$|Thomas Tilson was the rector of Ditton from 1679–1702 {{and was in}} {{correspondence}} with the Protestant cleric Richard Baxter. In one letter Tilson described how a woman from Rochester had gone to her father's house in West Malling where she died on 4 June 1691. While on her death bed, at {{two o'clock in the}} morning, she appeared as an apparition to a nurse in Rochester, some nine miles away, where her children were being looked after. It had been the dying woman's wish to see her children before she died <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> persuaded not to travel because of her ill health. Baxter included this account in his subsequent book The Certainty of the Worlds of the Spirits published in the same year. Tilson died in 1750 and his memorial in St. Peter's AD Vincula Church records a bequest he made to the poor of [...] "£100 in money, the yearly produce to be distributed annually on the feasts of All Saints and the Purification, in wood and wheat" [...] (see inscription in photograph).|$|E
2500|$|To {{answer the}} Italians, {{the only major}} Ottoman naval unit in the region was the torpedo cruiser after briefly {{engaging}} the Italian torpedo cruiser [...] and the gunboat [...] off Al Hudaydah, she fled into the port, and was later interned in British-controlled Suez. The rest of the Ottoman fleet was concentrated in the Mediterranean Sea, and it remained {{in the safety of}} the Sea of Marmara, where it could support the coastal defenses along the Dardanelles. Six gunboats that had been stationed in the Persian Gulf were recalled to the Mediterranean, but after their arrival in the Red Sea, they had run low on coal. A steamer, , was to provide coal for the vessels, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> captured by the Italian squadron.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, George became {{interested}} in Princess Maria of Greece and Denmark, the youngest daughter of King George I of the Hellenes and Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia. Maria of Greece was neither beautiful nor interested in marrying him, but he persevered. In April 1896, he arrived in Athens and asked her hand in marriage. She {{would have wanted to}} remain in Greece <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> forbidden to marry a commoner she {{had fallen in love with}} and ultimately decided to accept Grand Duke George proposal instead of her other suitor, Prince Aleksandar Obrenović of Serbia. [...] Their courtship took place during the Olympic Games in Athens, but she made clear she was not in love with him; it was a marriage of convenience. The wedding took place only four years later and at her insistence on Greece soil, in Corfu on 12 May 1900. The couple spent their honeymoon in Italy and after visiting Austria they settled in Russia. They spoke French to each other.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{witness to}} testify {{on behalf of}} the {{prosecution}} was Barbara Ann Cross, the daughter of the Reverend John Cross, who was aged 13 in 1963. Cross had been slightly wounded in the bombing, and had attended the same Sunday School class as the four victims {{on the day of the}} bombing. On May 15, Cross testified that prior to the explosion, she and the four girls killed had each attended a Youth Day Sunday School lesson in which the theme taught was how to react to a physical injustice. Cross testified that each girl present had been taught to contemplate how Jesus would react to affliction or injustice, with the message taught being to consider, [...] "What Would Jesus Do?" [...] Cross testified that she would herself have accompanied her friends into the basement lounge to change into robes for the forthcoming sermon, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> given an assignment. Shortly thereafter, she had heard [...] "the most horrible noise", before being struck on the head by debris.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} many claimants to the poem's authorship, {{including}} attributions to traditional and Native American origins. Dear Abby author Abigail Van Buren researched the poem's history and concluded in 1998 that Mary Elizabeth Frye, who was living in Baltimore at the time, had written the poem in 1932. According to Van Buren's research, Frye had never written any poetry, but the plight of a German Jewish woman, Margaret Schwarzkopf, who was staying with her and her husband, had inspired the poem. Margaret Schwarzkopf was concerned about her mother, who was ill in Germany, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> warned not to return home because of increasing unrest. When her mother died, the heartbroken young woman told Frye that she never {{had the chance to}} [...] "stand by my mother's grave and shed a tear". Frye, according to Van Buren's research, found herself composing a piece of verse on a brown paper shopping bag. Later she said that the words [...] "just came to her" [...] and expressed what she felt about life and death.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1858, Wilson G. Hunt was {{withdrawn}} from the Fraser River service and the following year plied on Puget Sound [...] under Capt. A.M. Burns, with Daniel B. Foster as purser. [...] Hunt had been chartered by the Olympia steamboat agent John H. Scranton, who held the mail contract for Puget Sound. [...] Previously the mails had been carried by the steamer Constitution [...] <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> taken off the route to be repaired preparatory to being transferred to San Francisco. [...] The shallow-draft inland steamer Hunt was regarded as being more suitable for the route than the deeper-draft ocean-going Constitution. [...] In July 1859, the sternwheeler Julia Barclay was brought around to Puget Sound from the Columbia River, arriving on July 9 in Olympia, Washington. [...] John H. Scranton had arranged to have her carry the mail contract which he continued to hold. [...] For about a month Captain Burns tried to complete against the Julia on the Olympia to Victoria run, but Julias mail contract gave her an advantage and when there wasn't enough business to sustain both boats, the Hunt was tied up in Victoria for about a year.|$|E

2500|$|That same day, Jean {{responded with}} a public statement, saying [...] "I wish to tell you {{unequivocally}} that both my husband and I are proud to be Canadian {{and that we have}} the greatest respect for the institutions of our country. We are fully committed to Canada. I would not have accepted this position otherwise... have never belonged to a political party or the separatist movement," [...] and {{went on to say that}} in the documented footage she had been speaking about Haiti, and not Quebec. Martin added on his earlier comments: [...] "There is no doubt in my mind that her devotion to Canada is longstanding and resolute," [...] though some critics continued to argue that Jean's response had been too vague. By late August, polls showed that there had been a 20% drop in support for the recommendation of Jean as the next governor general, in response to which the Haitian community voiced their support for Jean, even holding special church services in her honour. Jean reaffirmed in late 2010 that the rumours of her separatist sympathies were untrue and revealed that she had been upset by those journalists who she saw as capitalizing on sensationalism, rather than seeking accuracy through investigation, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> advised repeatedly not to respond.|$|E
