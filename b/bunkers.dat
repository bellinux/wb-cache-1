5|$|The {{concrete}} <b>bunkers</b> of Albania are a ubiquitous {{sight in}} the country, {{with an average of}} 5.7 <b>bunkers</b> for every square kilometre. The <b>bunkers</b> (Albanian: bunkerët) were built during the communist government of Enver Hoxha from the 1960s to the 1980s; by 1983 a total of 173,371 concrete <b>bunkers</b> had been constructed around the country.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>bunkers</b> {{were never}} {{used in a}} real {{conflict}} during Hoxha's rule, some found use in conflicts that {{broke out in the}} 1990s. During the 1997 rebellion in Albania, the townspeople of Sarandë in southern Albania were reported to have taken up positions in <b>bunkers</b> around the town in the face of fighting between government troops and rebels. After the outbreak of the Kosovo War in 1999, border villages in Albania were repeatedly shelled by Serbian artillery batteries located in nearby Kosovo and local people used the <b>bunkers</b> to shelter from the shelling.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{shortage}} of housing {{after the fall}} of the Communist regime in 1990 led some Albanians to set up home in abandoned <b>bunkers,</b> though the lack of running water and sanitation meant that the area around inhabited <b>bunkers</b> soon became contaminated and unhealthy. A few <b>bunkers</b> have found more creative uses. In the coastal city of Durrës one beachside bunker has been turned into the Restaurant Bunkeri, and another bunker in Gjirokastër was turned into a café.|$|E

50|$|Scandinavian <b>Bunkering</b> was {{a global}} {{provider}} of <b>bunker</b> oil and lubricant for the shipping industry. Founded in 1993, main offices {{are located in}} Tønsberg, Norway, though the company also has offices in Singapore and Montevideo. In 1997 Scandinavian <b>Bunkering</b> bought Sea <b>Bunker,</b> founded in 1981. On 26 September 2016, Scandinavian <b>Bunkering</b> merged with Glander International <b>Bunkering.</b>|$|R

5|$|At {{various places}} along the coast, {{large numbers of}} QZ <b>bunkers</b> were built in groups of three, linked to each other by a {{prefabricated}} concrete tunnel. Elsewhere <b>bunkers</b> were constructed in groupings around strategic points across the country, or in lines across swathes of territory. Tirana was particularly heavily defended, with thousands of <b>bunkers</b> radiating out in fifty concentric circles around the city.|$|E
5|$|Kosovo Albanian {{refugees}} took {{to using}} <b>bunkers</b> as temporary shelters until aid agencies could move them into tent camps, while NATO troops stationed in Albania relocated dozens of <b>bunkers</b> to fortify their base at Kukës. The Kosovo Liberation Army also used them as defensive positions during the Kosovo War, {{though this was}} not without its risks; {{on at least one}} occasion <b>bunkers</b> along Albania's border with Kosovo were mistakenly bombed by NATO aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The bunkerisation {{programme}} was {{a massive}} drain on Albania's weak economy. The construction of prefabricated <b>bunkers</b> alone cost an estimated two percent of net material product, and in total the <b>bunkers</b> cost {{more than twice as}} much as the Maginot Line in France, consuming three times as much concrete. The programme diverted resources away from other forms of development, such as roads and residential buildings. On average, they are said to have each cost the equivalent of a two-room apartment and the resources used to build them could easily have resolved Albania's chronic shortage of housing. According to Josif Zagali, building twenty smaller <b>bunkers</b> cost as much as constructing a kilometre of road. It also had a human cost; 70–100 people a year died constructing the <b>bunkers.</b> In addition, the <b>bunkers</b> occupied and obstructed a significant area of arable land.|$|E

5|$|German U-boat {{bases in}} {{occupied}} Norway operated between 1940 and 1945, when the Kriegsmarine (German navy), converted several naval bases in Norway into submarine bases. Norwegian coastal cities became {{available to the}} Kriegsmarine after the invasion of Denmark and Norway in April 1940. Following {{the conclusion of the}} Norwegian Campaign (June 1940), the occupying Germans began to transfer U-boats stationed in Germany to many Norwegian port cities such as Bergen, Narvik, Trondheim, Hammerfest and Kirkenes. Initial planning for many U-boat <b>bunkers</b> began in late 1940. Starting in 1941, the Todt Organisation began the construction of <b>bunkers</b> in Bergen and Trondheim. These <b>bunkers</b> were completed by Weyss & Freytagg AG between 1942 and 1943.|$|E
30|$|<b>Bunkering</b> {{decisions}} in practice are usually {{taken by a}} department that deals with <b>bunkering,</b> which is always located in the head office of the shipping company. The decision makers are the <b>bunker</b> managers, who deal only with <b>bunkering</b> of the ships.|$|R
30|$|This dataset {{contains}} {{records of}} bunkerings {{reported to the}} Harbour Master of the Port of Antwerp (PoA) (data since recording started in November 2011, up to 6 September 2013). It includes <b>bunkering</b> information such as date, <b>bunkering</b> company, location, <b>bunker</b> ship, ship <b>bunkered,</b> previous port of call, next port of call, type of fuel <b>bunkered,</b> volume <b>bunkered,</b> etc. It is noted by the PoA that this data is most likely incomplete, as reporting bunkerings is not mandatory.|$|R
50|$|Gibraltar {{offers a}} wide range of {{specialist}} services including <b>bunkering</b> to dry dock services at Gibdock. The main activity is <b>bunkering</b> with over four million tonnes of heavy petroleum fuel (<b>bunker</b> fuel) delivered each year (based on 2011). Gibraltar claims to be amongst the largest Mediterranean <b>bunkering</b> ports. Approximately 60% of the 10,000 vessels who stopped at Gibraltar in 2011 were <b>bunkered.</b>|$|R
5|$|Adolf Hitler {{was furious}} that the British {{had been able}} to sail a {{flotilla}} of ships up the Loire unhindered. His immediate reaction was to dismiss Generaloberst Carl Hilpert, chief-of-staff to the Commander in Chief West. The raid refocused German attention on the Atlantic Wall, and special attention was given to ports to prevent any repeat of the raid. By June 1942, the Germans began using concrete to fortify gun emplacements and <b>bunkers</b> in quantities previously only used in U-boat pens. Hitler laid out new plans in a meeting with Armaments Minister Albert Speer in August 1942, calling for the construction of 15,000 <b>bunkers</b> by May 1943 to defend the Atlantic coast from Norway to Spain.|$|E
5|$|Bergen {{remained}} a quiet base {{during the first}} few years of the occupation, experiencing only one large Allied air attack. In 1943, the U-boat base added two new <b>bunkers,</b> U-Stützpunkt Prien and U-Stützpunkt Weddingen along with a shipyard named Danziger Werft.|$|E

It has also been reported that this <b>bunker</b> could still be intact.|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} this study can be used by port authorities, but are also {{important}} to <b>bunkering</b> operators. The obtained knowledge enables the port and <b>bunkering</b> operators to improve their competitive position in ship <b>bunkering.</b> This can be done by designing appropriate instruments or business strategies to target the most important attributes in <b>bunkering</b> choice and improve the competitive position in the ship <b>bunkering</b> market.|$|R

5|$|The U-boat base at Bergen grew {{exponentially}} {{after the}} liberation of France by the Western Allies, when the senior commanding officer of U-boat operations in the west ("FdU West") was moved from Angers, France to the city. A large expansion program was conducted at the base and several new anti-aircraft guns were set up to protect the U-boat <b>bunkers.</b> More engineers and technicians were moved to Bergen to accommodate the increased technical requirements of the base as well. Two more <b>bunkers</b> named Werft Gemeinschaftslager 1 and Gemeinschaftslager 2 were also built during this time.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there had}} been plenty of {{fighting}}, the main Japanese force on Manus had not been located. Advancing inland towards Rossum, the 7thCavalry found it on 20March. Six days of fighting around Rossum were required before the 7th and 8thCavalry reduced the entrenched Japanese positions there. The Japanese <b>bunkers,</b> actually log and earth pillboxes, proved resistant to artillery fire.|$|E
5|$|An {{appeal for}} holiday {{pictures}} and postcards of Europe announced on the BBC produced over ten million items, {{some of which}} proved useful.

50|$|To his surprise, <b>Bunker</b> {{returns to}} the bus; while Nugent is ready to fire on him, Nugent is made to stand down by a {{superior}} officer. <b>Bunker</b> has come to see Mosley as his friend and wants {{to be there for}} him to see this through. <b>Bunker's</b> tenacity convinces Mosley to get to the courthouse, and he manages to drive the bus into an alley, temporarily blocking the police from following them. He finds that <b>Bunker</b> has been wounded, and calls Diane, a paramedic, to bring an ambulance around to help, despite knowing she will be followed. Diane cares for Mosley and <b>Bunker's</b> wounds, though <b>Bunker</b> still needs further treatment at a hospital. As Diane's ambulance drives away, the police stop her but discover the ambulance is empty; she had a second ambulance pick up Mosley and <b>Bunker</b> that would not be under similar surveillance. Meanwhile, Mosley reveals to <b>Bunker</b> that should he testify, not only will Nugent be convicted but so would Mosley as one of the corrupt cops. Mosley gets off a block from the courthouse and wishes <b>Bunker</b> luck with his bakery, instructing the paramedic to take <b>Bunker</b> to the Port Authority and put him on a bus for Seattle. <b>Bunker</b> promises to send him a cake on his birthday.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bunker</b> Hill {{was laid}} out in 1855. The community's name commemorated the Battle of <b>Bunker</b> Hill. A post office was {{established}} at <b>Bunker</b> Hill in 1855, and remained in operation until 1904.|$|R

5|$|As the French {{constructed}} further fortifications, Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance aircraft}} {{picked up the}} activity and reported it. The steep slopes {{on the banks of}} the Meuse, added to what appeared in photographic reconnaissance to be a formidable barrier of <b>bunkers</b> and defence lines, caused Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander in chief of Army Group A, to question the wisdom of Guderian in choosing Sedan as the point of maximum effort. To identify how strong these fortifications were, a team of photographic specialists were called in to evaluate the pictures. Their analysis concluded that what appeared to be strong fortified positions were just the construction sites of half-built <b>bunkers</b> that were, to all intents and purposes, empty shells. The contribution of the specialists tilted the Sedan attack plan into Guderian's favour.|$|E
5|$|At Wonsan 11 July– 12 July, New Jersey fired one of {{the most}} {{concentrated}} bombardments of her Korean duty. For nine hours the first day, and for seven the second, her guns opened fire on gun positions and <b>bunkers</b> on Hodo Pando and the mainland with telling effect. At least ten enemy guns were destroyed, many damaged, and a number of caves and tunnels sealed. New Jersey smashed radar control positions and bridges at Kojo 13 July, and was once more on the east coast bombline 22 July– 24 July to support South Korean troops near Kosong. These days found her gunners at their most accurate: A large cave, housing an important enemy observation post was closed, the end of a month-long United Nations effort, and a great many <b>bunkers,</b> artillery areas, observation posts, trenches, tanks and other weapons were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Between 2 and 8 December New Jersey {{returned}} {{to aid the}} 3rd Marine Division, shelling Viet Cong bunker complexes for the Marines operating around the Da Nang area before departing for Singapore 9 December. On 26 December New Jersey {{returned to}} the gunline, taking up station off Tuy Hòa {{in support of the}} Army of the Republic of Vietnam 47th Division. For the next three days New Jersey fired her guns to support the II Corps, in the process destroying Viet Cong <b>bunkers</b> and supply depots and neutralizing enemy cave posts. New Jersey would remain in the waters of the DMZ until after New Years, shelling Communist <b>bunkers</b> for ground troops until leaving to support the 1st Marine Division 3 January.|$|E
50|$|Although {{wounded in}} the {{shoulder}} and leg, he pressed on his solitary charge with grim determination, until he closed in on the first <b>bunker.</b> Then in ferocious hand-to-hand combat, he killed two of the enemy and cleared the first <b>bunker.</b> It was the turning point. Inspired by their leader's spontaneous valour, the troops charged at the enemy and fell upon them. Unmindful of his grievous wounds, he rushed from <b>bunker</b> to <b>bunker</b> urging his men on. Critically injured, he collapsed at the final <b>bunker</b> and finally succumbed to his injuries. But by this time he had already captured the <b>bunker</b> with his men.|$|R
