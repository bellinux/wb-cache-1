5|$|In {{her efforts}} to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> wife, she was often given an eye for trying too hard, {{but at the same}} time, she became a subject of envy for fellow politicians' wives. Imelda learned how to get people's {{attention}} and to focus it on both her and her husband. She reached out to every single person who was seen as essential in Marcos's campaign. Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook hands with all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood the concerns they had, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts when necessary.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} said of Hannah de Rothschild that she {{grew up with a}} good sense and {{presence}} of mind, enabling her to deputise for her mother on grand social occasions at Mentmore and in London. This gave her confidence and the experience to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> political wife. Marriage to her altered Rosebery's status, too: while his wife acquired Christian respectability and a title, Rosebery moved from being one of many wealthy and capable young noblemen to being one with unfathomable riches. This, coupled with his good looks, appealed to the public's imagination and gave him glamour.|$|E

Angel Eyes asks him why, {{mentioning}} that he had heard that three <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> number. Blondie responds that six <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> number, because he has six bullets left in his revolver.|$|R

Mr. Burns is so {{impressed}} that he hires Homer on the spot. When Homer returns to Marge's house, he discovers from Jacqueline that she has gone into labor and is already at the hospital. He quickly gets there and sees Marge with Selma and an angry Patty, who starts berating him. Fed up with her disrespect, Homer lashes out at Patty and angrily tells Patty (as well {{as the rest of the}} Bouvier family) to start showing him some respect for he has a job, a piece of news that Homer promptly tells Marge before she finally gives birth to Bart. After Homer finishes telling his flashback story, he admits to Bart that he received the greatest gift a man can have the day Bart was born. At that time, Marge arrives home with the news that she is not pregnant. They are both overjoyed and high-five.|$|E

25|$|Believing {{the game}} {{could also be}} a success on the PC, Interplay's Feargus Urquhart and David Perry {{contacted}} Polish developers CD Projekt. As Poland was known for only developing PC games, Urquhart and Perry believed Projekt would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> team to port Dark Alliance to PC. Sebastian Zieliński, developer of Mortyr 2093-1944, which Interplay had published, was placed in charge of the project, with Adam Badowski, a film storyboard artist, hired as designer. A PlayStation 2 development kit was smuggled from Interplay's offices in London to Poland, and work on the port began. However, almost immediately, Interplay cancelled development.|$|E
25|$|Doberman Pinschers {{were first}} bred {{in the town}} of Apolda, in the German state of Thuringia around 1890, {{following}} the Franco-Prussian War by Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann. Dobermann served in the dangerous role of local tax collector, and ran the Apolda dog pound. With access to dogs of many breeds, he aimed to create a breed that would be ideal for protecting him during his collections, which took him through many bandit-infested areas. He set out to breed a new type of dog that, in his opinion, would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> combination of strength, speed, endurance, loyalty, intelligence, and ferocity. Later, Otto Goeller and Philip Greunig continued to develop the breed to become the dog that is seen today.|$|E

But something was amiss: The 5000 original Cybers, engineered to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> servants, mimicked human emotions too closely, displaying free will of their own. When they disobey orders from Reichter, he orders all of the Cyber Series to be destroyed. After Cyber-29 died falling from a cliff, Reichter transfers his brain {{into the body of}} a panther and names him Data-7. Cyber-6 was the only true Cyber to survive the massacre, escaping {{with the help of a}} black slave who hid her away in a fishing village. When Reichter interrogates to kill the slave, Cybersix arrives at the city of Meridiana, where she battles Reichter and his minions, and disguises herself as fellow teacher Adrian Seidelman after the real one is killed in a car wreck.|$|E
25|$|Herb Stempel was a {{contestant}} on Twenty One who was {{coached by}} the show's producer Dan Enright. While Stempel {{was in the}} midst of his winning streak, both of the $64,000 quiz shows were in the top-ten rated programs but Twenty One did not have the same popularity. Enright and his partner Albert Freedman were searching for a new champion to replace Stempel to boost ratings. They soon found what they were looking for in Charles Van Doren. Van Doren was an English teacher at Columbia University when a friend suggested he try out for a quiz show. Van Doren decided to try out for the quiz show Tic-Tac-Dough. Enright, who produced both Tic-Tac-Dough and Twenty One, saw Van Doren's tryout and was familiar with his prestigious family background that included multiple Pulitzer Prize-winning authors and highly respected professors at Columbia University. As a result, Enright felt that Van Doren would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> contestant to be the new face of Twenty One.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship and}} crew {{performed}} {{so well in}} Ocean Safari '87 that Forrestals commanding officer, CAPT John A.

Special liberty calls serve to reward Navy personnel with a trip {{to other parts of}} the U.S. and provides Americans who would normally never see warships and planes an up close look at life in the United States Navy. CAPT Pieno being a native of New Orleans, Louisiana, decided that New Orleans, during her Mardi Gras celebration, would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> location to show off his pride and joy. During her trip to New Orleans Forrestal broke another record by becoming the largest ship to sail on the Mississippi River. Also during her four days in New Orleans she accommodated tours for over 40,000 visitors. The tour included viewings and descriptions of all her aircraft, damage control demonstrations, and the crowd's favorite, a ride on one of her four aircraft elevators.|$|E

25|$|Point of Grace {{was formed}} at Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas. Denise Masters, Terry Lang and Heather Floyd, who {{knew each other}} from Norman, Oklahoma, coincidentally found {{themselves}} at OBU, and got involved in music. They sang in a vocal group called 'The Ouachitones,' which {{was made up of}} 14 girls. Within the group, the girls formed a trio, and after a sound check for an Ouachitones performance, the girls were singing a cappella when they were told by an onlooker that they should do something together. Shelley Phillips had come from Little Rock, Arkansas to OBU with a scholarship in vocal performance. She sang in a group called the Praise Singers, made up of four girls and four guys and they traveled around the country performing concerts. She became friends with Terry and Heather through Denise, who was her roommate and sister in the social club Chi Delta. After Heather, Terry and Denise made plans to form a trio and sing together over the summer, Denise went back to her dorm room and told Shelley about their summer plans. After Shelley suggested that the trio became a quartet, it seemed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> fit.|$|E
25|$|Following their {{exit from}} the FA Cup the {{previous}} weekend, a trip to Pride Park to play bottom-placed Derby County on 15 March looked to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> opportunity for the Red Devils to bounce back and show their title credentials. However, the game did not prove as simple as one would have expected, as United {{had to work hard}} for their narrow 1–0 victory. As was the case with many of Manchester United's games in the 2007–08 season, luck was not on their side in the opening exchanges of the game. United goalkeeper Ben Foster, making his debut due to the unavailability of Van der Sar and Tomasz Kuszczak, then staked his claim to the number 1 jersey with a pair of fine saves from Derby striker Kenny Miller. Cristiano Ronaldo proved to be the thorn in Derby's side on a number of occasions, testing former Manchester United goalkeeper Roy Carroll with a curling effort hit with the outside of his foot and a 40-yard free kick. The breakthrough finally came in the 76th minute, Ronaldo scoring a deserved goal from a Wayne Rooney cross. With Arsenal only managing a draw against ten-man Middlesbrough in the day's late kick-off, United's win put them on top of the table on goal difference with a game in hand.|$|E
25|$|The film had {{its roots}} in an earlier concept for a new King Kong feature {{developed}} by Willis O'Brien, animator of the original stop-motion Kong. Around 1960, O'Brien {{came up with a}} proposed treatment, King Kong meets Frankenstein, where Kong would fight against a giant version of Frankenstein's monster in San Francisco. O'Brien took the project (which consisted of some concept art and a screenplay treatment) to RKO to secure permission to use the King Kong character. During this time the story was renamed King Kong vs. the Ginko when it was believed that Universal had the rights to the Frankenstein name (it actually only had the rights to the monster's makeup design). O'Brien was introduced to producer John Beck, who promised to find a studio to make the film (at this point in time, RKO was no longer a production company). Beck took the story treatment and had George Worthing Yates flesh it out into a screenplay. The story was slightly altered and the title changed to King Kong vs. Prometheus, returning the name to the original Frankenstein concept (The Modern Prometheus was the alternate name of Frankenstein in the original novel). Unfortunately, the cost of stop-motion animation discouraged potential studios from putting the film into production. After shopping the script around overseas, Beck eventually attracted the interest of the Japanese studio Toho, which had long wanted to make a King Kong film and was also planning for Godzilla to make a comeback around the same time. After purchasing the script, they decided to replace the Frankenstein creature with Godzilla to be King Kong's opponent and would have Shinichi Sekizawa rewrite Yates's script. The studio thought that it would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> way to celebrate its thirtieth year in production. It was one of 5 big banner releases for the company to celebrate the anniversary alongside Sanjuro, , Lonely Lane, and Born in Sin. John Beck's dealings with Willis O'Brien's project were done behind his back and O'Brien was never credited for his idea. In 1963, Merian C. Cooper attempted to file a lawsuit against John Beck claiming that he outright owned the King Kong character, but the lawsuit never went through as it turned out he was not Kong's sole legal owner as he had previously believed.|$|E
