50|$|The berm is the {{relatively}} planar {{part of the}} swash zone where the accumulation of sediment occurs at the landward farthest of swash motion (Figure 2). The berm protects the <b>backbeach</b> and coastal dunes from waves but erosion can occur under high energy conditions such as storms. The berm is more easily defined on gravel beaches and there can be multiple berms at different elevations. On sandy beaches in contrast, the gradient of <b>backbeach,</b> berm and beachface can be similar. The height of the berm is governed by the maximum elevation of sediment transport during the uprush. The berm height can be predicted using the equation by Takeda and Sunamura (1982)where Hb is the breaker height, g is gravity and T is the wave period.|$|E

On the back of these demos the band began playing around Melbourne and garnering local reviews. The trio would return to Back Beach in 1998 to record enough songs to form an album and the resulting LP 'Fraulein' was released on Perth label Halflight Records.|$|E
50|$|The {{swash zone}} is {{the upper part}} of the beach between <b>backbeach</b> and surf zone, where intense erosion occurs during storms (Figure 2). The swash zone is {{alternately}} wet and dry. Infiltration (hydrology) (above the water table) and exfiltration (below the water table) take place between the swash flow and the beach groundwater table. Beachface, berm, beach step and beach cusps are the typical morphological features associated with swash motion. Infiltration (hydrology) and sediment transport by swash motion are important factors that govern the gradient of the beachface.|$|E
50|$|Throughout 2006, {{the group}} {{periodically}} lay down tracks for their third full-length release, handling the recording and producing duties {{themselves with the}} aim of capturing their renowned live energy onto tape. This marked the first time they recorded away from <b>Backbeach</b> Studios, with guitars and bass recorded at 'The Bat Cave', vocals tracked at 'The Fight Club House' and drums and final mixing overseen by Reggie Bowman at Scream Louder Studios. They also played the final Metal for the Brain on 4 November 2006, the group's fifth appearance at the popular underground heavy metal festival (not including the cancelled 2002 event).|$|E
5000|$|... "7 Years" [...] is {{the lead}} single by the Australian nu metal band Superheist from their second studio album, Identical Remote Controlled Reactions.

50|$|Despite being {{recorded}} {{again at}} <b>Backbeach</b> Studios with DW Norton behind the mixing desk, Blood Oath saw {{a change in}} direction for the band, with more thrash metal influences being introduced, more melodic passages present and Adam B. Metal's vocals being {{in stark contrast to}} those of former vocalist Glynn. Despite their change in direction, Blood Oath proved to be Frankenbok's most successful album to date, and eventually gained a European release in 2004. Live dates followed, including an appearance at Metal for the Brain (in December 2003, as 2002's event had been cancelled due to litigation which Frankenbok had also been confirmed for) and the nationwide 'Blood Letting' tour with Daysend (who featured members of former touring companions Psi.Kore) in support of their recent album.|$|E
50|$|The tracks {{foundations}} {{were written}} by Dedman {{on a beach in}} Red Rock, Northern NSW and was just an acoustic idea that him and Biro jammed on from time to time. The track was overlooked during initial pre-production as it did not seem to fit with the style {{of the rest of the}} album. It was eventually taken into the studio and extra parts were co-written by all five members. Norton co-produced the track with Adam Rhodes at <b>Backbeach</b> Studios in Rye, Victoria. The single reached No. 50 on the ARIA Singles Chart.The b-side of the single features a completely acoustic version of the song, the No Regrets Version, which uses the original vocal track and has Fetah playing acoustic guitar, Sean playing congas and Drew adding a more simplified bass part. It was recorded at Phat Farm studio by Adam Rhodes. It is the only Superheist track to not feature DW Norton.The song was not to popular with many of the core fans feeling they had strayed to far into a 'made for radio' sound. The track however did expose Superheist to a whole new fanbase, with regular rotation on commercial radio stations in Australia. The track has always had either a love it or hate it relationship with the fans and the band members.|$|E

In 2006 Norton and Dedman started demoing new tracks with Matt “Skitz” Sanders from Damaged on drums, Seanheist had injured his knee and ankle and was unable to commit to recording at this time. Three new songs were recorded but were never fully finished and were soon shelved. The second attempt at reformation was in 2008 with the lineup of Biro, Norton, Seanheist and Dedman rehearsing some old songs and jamming new material a handful of times. Personality clashes, old grievances and just bad timing just made the reformation impossible to go ahead. In 2012 All five members of the band from the IRCR line-up finally caught up and met at the album's 10 year Anniversary party at Norton’s bar (Whole Lotta Love) in Melbourne, talks of reforming were once again on the table, but nothing eventuated.|$|E
5000|$|Superheist {{were formed}} in Frankston, Victoria in 1993. The {{original}} line-up was Rod “Berger” McLeod on vocals, DW Norton on guitar, Sean “Seanheist” Pentecost on drums, Fetah Sabawi on keyboards and samples, and Adrian Sudborough on bass. The band was originally {{to be named}} Orgheist, which {{was inspired by the}} European grind core bands that they were influenced by at the time.

Later that year bassist Sudborough was replaced with Adam [...] "Donut" [...] Donath and the next year was spent touring the country with bands such as In:Extremis, Damaged and Beanflipper. Superheist were now a regular feature of the Melbourne grind scene and played at such venues as The GB and The Hell Club, the band were learning their craft and honing what would eventually become the foundation for a world class live show. In early December 1995 they appeared at the annual Metal for the Brain festival in Canberra, which raised funds for the National Brain Injury Foundation. This pivotal performance helped the band set themselves up {{for the next few years}} to come. They returned for the 1996 festival but by that time Seanheist had left the group due to his waining interest in playing extreme metal. Aaren “Suds” Suttil (1974-2006) of Dreadnaught replaced him on drums.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Backbeach</b> {{deflation}} aprons are heterogeneous, coarse clastic deposits {{associated with}} active transverse dune fields. The apron comprises variously angular, rounded, fractured, cracked, polished, and ventifacted clasts of bedrock (local and exotic), beachrock, and bioherm fragments (coral and worm reef). Terrestrial and anthropogenic clasts (from archeological sites, deflated dunes, flotsam, and shipwrecks) are also present. The unit forms as a lag deposit {{on top of}} a gently sloping (ca. 0. 008), planar sandy deflation surface and is typically only one clast thick. It is up to 100 m wide and extends for tens of kilometers along the coast. It is replaced landward by a steep (ca. 0. 1) deflated soil surface armored with a layer of iron concretions. <b>Backbeach</b> deflation aprons are compound deposits that result from marine storm, eolian, and human activity since the mid-Holocene. The depositional model proposed involves periodic storm deposition of coarse clasts (of beachrock, bedrock, and biogenic origin) and flotsam (shipwreck and other floating debris) on the <b>backbeach</b> or dunes. Some clasts are deposited directly into interdune depressions and enter the deflation plain immediately. Others are deposited initially on dune surfaces. Dune migration results in winnowing of the storm-deposited coarse clasts (together with rhizoliths and any other coarse material in the dune) until they come to rest on the deflation surface. The lag deposit is subsequently buried and uncovered multiple times by dune migration, during which time it is exposed to polishing and subaerial weathering. Consequently, the lag comprises a variety of materials that reflect both storm and eolian processes. The clasts exhibit variable degrees of rounding, polishing, an...|$|E
30|$|According to May (2010), the washover {{structures}} in the Lefkada area have not been affected by modifications at least during the last 150 years, leading to the assumption that normal storm activity of annual, decadal or even centennial intensity does not significantly influence the back-beach area, and is not capable of generating extensive fan-shaped washover and/or breaching {{structures in}} the Lefkada coastal zone. Since the study area belongs to a region of remarkably high seismic activity and tsunami recurrence rates, the occurrence of tsunami of variable magnitudes is very likely (Vött et al., 2006). However, nor younger tsunami events reported by tsunami catalogues for the years 1867, 1869, 1914, 1915 and 1948 significantly altered the <b>backbeach</b> geomorphology {{in the study area}} (May, 2010).|$|E
40|$|Swash {{action is}} the {{dominant}} process responsible for the cross-shore exchange of sediment between the subaerial and subaqueous zones, with {{a significant part of}} the littoral drift also taking place as a result of swash motions. The swash zone is the area of the beach between the inner surfzone and <b>backbeach</b> that is intermittently submerged and exposed by the processes of wave uprush and backwash. Given the dominant role that swash plays in the morphological evolution of a beach, it is important to understand and quantify the main processes. The extent of swash (horizontally and vertically), current velocities and suspended sediment concentrations are all parameters of interest in the study of swash processes. In situ methods of measurements in this energetic zone were instrumental in developing early understanding of swash processes, however, the field has experienced a shift towards remote sensing methods. This article outlines the emergence of high precision technologies such as video imaging and LIDAR (light detection and ranging) for the study of swash processes. Furthermore, the applicability of these methods to large-scale datasets for quantitative analysis is demonstrated...|$|E
30|$|In {{the study}} area, fan {{structures}} {{extending from the}} barrier beach into the shallow-water <b>backbeach</b> lagoonal area represent a prominent feature of the local coastal geomorphology. As documented for the Gyra fan, they consist of allochthonous, sublittoral and/or littoral sediments. Sedimentary and microfaunal characteristics match typical signatures reported from extreme wave deposits worldwide and provide clear evidence for its event-induced origin. However, most of these characteristics do not represent diagnostic, unambiguous criteria for {{the determination of the}} event source. The Gyra fan is built up of up to four stratigraphic subunits, each showing different sedimentary characteristics. This diagnostic feature together with the sheer dimension of the fan, its consistent general internal stratigraphical architecture, the occurrence of mud drapes between individual subunits and the synopsis of the sedimentary and microfaunal findings argue for a tsunami-induced rather than a storm-induced formation. This scenario fits best with the local geomorphological settings and the regional storm and wave climates. The subunits likely correspond to at least four major inundation phases during one tsunami event. Sediment transport and related deposition seem to have been largest during flooding impulses in the middle part of the tsunami wave train.|$|E
40|$|Bunces Key, a narrow, linear, {{barrier island}} on the west-central coast of Florida, {{was founded in}} 1961. Its growth and {{development}} since that time is well documented by aerial photography. Cores taken from the Key and surrounding areas reveal a stratigraphic succession of facies reflecting rapid vertical aggradation. Sedimentation began on a gently sloping platform through the landward migration of large scale bedforms (sand waves) during fair weather periods. Migration of these bedforms ceased when emergence and lack of continued overwash precluded further movement. Vertical accretion to supratidal levels resulted from the continued onshore transport of sediment and subsequent welding to the previously formed bars. Stratigraphically, the barrier exhibits a 2 ̆ 2 layer-cake 2 ̆ 2 type of stratigraphy, with nearshore sediments overlain by foreshore, <b>backbeach,</b> and dune deposits. The backbarrier generally exhibits muddy lagoon sediments intercalated with washover and channel margin sediments. Fining upward washover sequences reflect the unstable nature of the island. Low pressure systems commonly cause overtopping of the barrier, with the subsequent formation of tidal inlets and washover fans. Aerial photographs document {{the formation of an}} initial barrier that was breached twice prior to 1973. A second barrier formed in late 1973 just seaward of the initial island and subsequently grew through littoral drift to a length of 1. 8 km. A narrow inlet (30 m) formed through the northern end of the island in 1982...|$|E
40|$|The dune zone {{included}} in the coastal area and located {{to the left of}} the Garigliano River mouth has been studied. It plays a key role in the balance of a coastal environment for its positive effect on the beach and <b>backbeach.</b> The sedimentary and morphological studies have allowed to defi ne that the analyzed coastal area is affected diffusely by erosion processes linked to natural factors as well as to human activities of various kinds; causing the complete erosion of foredune occurred. The foredune plays a crucial role in the dynamic relationship with the beach and sediment supply of the other dunes. The erosion processes resulted into a signifi cant retreat of the shoreline (on average about ninety meters in the last 55 years), as well as the alteration of the succession of vegetation assemblages characteristic of coastal environments. Even the secondary dunes is being dismantled, only 50 years ago it was tertiary and stable. Two elements emerge: the crucial absence of the foredune, responsible for the sediment supply of the other dunes, and the anomalous advanced position of secondary dune, which is in the process of dismantling with the progressive loss of the juniper habitat of high environmental value. Among the human factors contributing to the shoreline retreating there are some negative practices such as cleaning by mechanical means and the extension of the beach at the expense of the dune, with strong reduction in terms both of resilience and of potential growth capacity of the dune itsel...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the geomorphic {{setting of}} the Sigatoka dune field on the south coast of Viti Levu in Fiji is {{critical}} for interpreting the associated archaeological site, with culture levels dating back to 3000 years ago. The dune field lies along the seaward fringe of the Holocene delta of the Sigatoka River, which drains interior highlands astride {{the boundary between the}} wet windward and dry leeward climatic zones of Viti Levu. Sand brought down to the shoreline by the Sigatoka River is transported longshore westward by surf along the delta front and blown inland oblique to the shore by the prevailing trade winds. Three successive culture levels, dating to approximately 900 - 400 B. C., A. D. 100 - 400, and A. D. 1300 - 1500, respectively, occur in three discrete paleosol horizons that are buried near the present beach face under younger dune sand. Our geomorphic analysis of the Sigatoka delta plain arid its environs reveals a complex Holocene history of progradation and aggradation, shifting distributaries, sea-level change, subsidence owing to sediment compaction, and enhancement of dune development through time. The oldest two of the three paleosols that have yielded artifacts evidently formed on a low-lying <b>backbeach</b> coastal flat, located behind a beach-dune berm-crest ridge of low relief, with only the youngest of the three paleosols representing a temporarily stabilized surface within a growing dune field. Enhanced dune growth may have been fostered by augmented sediment delivery to the coast as a result of wholesale inland deforestation associated with population movement into the interior highlands of the Sigatoka drainage basin.

40|$|Twenty-six beach {{profiles}} {{were surveyed}} {{immediately after the}} passage of storm conditions and were compared with pre-storm situations. They include 1) eleven locations spread throughout the entire 60 km reach of the Pinellas County coast including wide, narrow, natural and nourished sites, with and without seawalls; and 2) 15 locations confined to three adjacent nourishment projects along 14 km of Sand Key. The overall behavior of the nourished and natural beaches along the 60 km reach of coast was similar, displaying a general trend of 1) shoreline erosion ranging from 2 to 10 m, 2) upward and landward migration of the nearshore bar, and 3) <b>backbeach</b> accumulation and increase in the berm height. Shoreline orientation and beach sand composition played no significant role in beach performance during the storm. The technique of dry beach replenishment using a dragline and conveyer belt may contribute to the more severe shoreline erosion at the Indian Shores nourishment project as compared to the traditional pumping technique used at Indian Rocks Beach and Redington Beach. Temporary berm accumulation and shoreline accretion were recorded at two chronically eroding locations downdrift of structures. The shoreline accretion was caused by the landward sand transport induced by the storm waves. The storm accumulation was eroded by the normal-weather longshore sediment transport within three months after the storm. The current version of SBEACH model (Larson and Kraus 1989) failed to reproduce the Opal-induced beach changes in the surf zone. The unsuccessful prediction was attributed to the uncertainties in offshore wave measurement, and morphological and computational complications caused by the exposure of hard bottom in the nearshore region...|$|E
30|$|Fan-shaped {{sedimentary}} structures {{extending from}} barrier beach systems into <b>backbeach</b> coastal lagoons or coastal lowlands are described worldwide and represent an {{important feature of}} coastal geomorphology. In most cases, they are interpreted as (i) washover fans, resulting from {{the flow of water}} and sediment (overwash) over the crest of the beach, or (ii) scour fans, formed during breaching of the barrier beach (Andrade, 1992; Andrade et al., 2004; Donnelly et al., 2004; Matias et al., 2008). They are generally induced by high-energy extreme wave events such as tsunamis, tropical cyclones, or extra-tropical winter storm surges (e.g. Dawson, 1996; Luque et al., 2002; Sedgwick and Davis, 2003; Matias et al., 2008; Morales et al., 2008; Switzer and Jones, 2008 a; Goff et al., 2009). During the recent past, the number of studies which deal with sedimentary characteristics of washover sediments and/or structures and focus on an event-induced origin has increased (e.g. Tuttle et al., 2004; Morton et al., 2007; Switzer and Jones, 2008 b; Williams, 2009; Engel et al., 2010). However, in many cases, problems with the unambiguous determination of their origin remain, in particular when only the sedimentary record or the geomorphological structure, but no historical reports of the event itself are available. The distinguishability of tsunami and storm in the geological record is therefore a challenge of major importance in sedimentary research and in the research on extreme wave events in general (e.g. Goff et al., 2004; Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007; Morton et al., 2007; Switzer and Jones, 2008 a; Mamo et al., 2009; Benner et al., 2010). Against this background, detailed sedimentary analyses and descriptions of palaeo-washover structures and their sedimentary composition as well as comparisons with recently formed storm washovers are required.|$|E
40|$|Ivan, {{a strong}} Category 4 {{hurricane}} (downgraded to a Category 3 at landfall), caused widespread erosion and overwash along the northwestern Florida barrier-island beaches. This study examines the storm impact and short-term post-storm recovery along a 200 -km stretch of coast from Fort Walton Beach eastward to St. George Island. One prestorm and three poststorm beach-profile surveys {{were conducted to}} quantify the storm-induced morphological changes and poststorm recovery. Forty-six trenches were excavated to study the characteristics and thickness of subaerial storm deposits. Extensive inundation and overwash occurred within 100 km from the storm center at landfall. Significant beach/dune erosion was measured as far as 300 km east of the storm center. The highest elevation of beach erosion extended considerably above the measured storm-surge level, indicating that storm-wave setup and swash run-up played significant roles in controlling the elevation of beach erosion. A simple empirical formula reproduced the wave setup and swash run-up reasonably well. Beach recovery began immediately after the storm. Within 90 days, the berm crest recovered to its prestorm elevation, although it was now located approximately 15 m landward for nonoverwashed sites and 30 to 40 m for overwashed sites. The steep prestorm foreshore slope was restored from the gentle storm profile within 30 days. An apparent erosional surface was observed along the impacted foredune and <b>backbeach,</b> extending over 300 km eastward from the storm center. This erosional surface represents a net elevation loss ranging from 0. 5 to over 2. 0 m. A storm layer of up to 50 cm thick was deposited above the erosional surface. Generally, the storm-layer thickness decreases away from the storm center, as well as landward from the high tide line. Local factors such as beach width and orientation, and sediment properties and supply caused variations in the thickness of storm deposit...|$|E
40|$|Coastal overwash {{deposits}} from tsunamis and storms {{have been}} identified and characterised from many coastal environments. To date, these investigations have utilised ad-hoc time, energy and cost intensive invasive techniques, such as, pits and trenches or taking core samples. Here, we present the application of high-frequency ground penetrating radar (GPR) to identify and characterise the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami (IOT) and palaeotsunami deposits from Phra Thong Island, Thailand. This site {{is one of the}} most intensively studied palaeotsunami sites globally and preserves a series of late-Holocene stacked sandy tsunami deposits within an organic, muddy low-energy <b>backbeach</b> environment. Using 100, 500 and 1000 MHz GPR antennas, 29 reflection profiles were collected from two swales (X and Y) inland of the modern beach, and two common mid-point (CMP) profiles using the 200 MHz antennas were collected from Swale Y. Detailed examination of the CMPs allowed accurate velocity estimates to be applied to each profile. The reflection profiles included across-swale profiles and a high-resolution grid in Swale X, and were collected to investigate the feasibility of GPR to image the palaeotsunami deposits, and two profiles from Swale Y where the tsunami deposits are poorly known. The 500 MHz antennas provided the best stratigraphic resolution which was independently validated from the stratigraphy and sedimentology recovered from 17 auger cores collected along the profiles. It is clear from the augers and GPR data, that the different dielectric properties of the individual layers allow the identification of the IOT and earlier tsunami deposits on Phra Thong Island. Although applied in a coastal setting here, this technique can be applied to other environments where thin sand beds are preserved, in order to prioritise sites for detailed examination...|$|E

Subaerial observations were collected monthly above the spring low-tide line. Wave buoys and a numerical model provided hourly wave estimates in 10 m depth at each site. These observations show that beach profile shapes (depth versus cross-shore distance) evolve consistent with the equilibrium hypothesis: under steady wave conditions, evolution is toward a unique, wave condition dependent, equilibrium beach profile. Beaches far out of equilibrium change rapidly, and as equilibrium is approached they change ever more slowly. At the sandy regions, a simple equilibrium beach state model has skill > 0. 5 (Chapter 2, [Ludka et al., 2015]). Repeated nourishments over multiple decades, costing {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars, are a primary beach management strategy worldwide, but the wave-driven redistribution of nourishment sand is poorly understood. At four survey sites, 50, 000 - 300, 000 m^ 3 of imported sand was placed on the subaerial beach over alongshore spans between 300 - 1300 m. Wave conditions in the months after placement were similar at all sites, but the subaerial nourishment pads eroded and retreated landward at different rates. A pad built with native-sized sand washed offshore in the first few storms. In contrast, nourishments with coarser than native sand remained on the beach face for several years and protected shorelines during the significant wave attack of the 2015 - 16 El Niño (Chapter 3, [Ludka et al., 2016]). These relatively resilient and coarse subaerial pads stretched alongshore in a pattern consistent with seasonally shifting, wave-driven alongshore currents. Natural gains and losses in the total sand volume budget, integrated spatially over each site, are sometimes larger than the nourishment contributions (Chapter 4, in prep for Coastal Engineering) ...|$|E
