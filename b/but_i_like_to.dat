500|$|At {{the time}} of the {{announcement}} of Windsor's departure, it was reported she wanted to take a two-year break, but after that would like to make return appearances as Peggy. However, in September 2010, she ruled out a return, saying, [...] "It was a bit selfish of me but I didn't want to be killed off. I am never going to go back <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> think that 's still out there somewhere." [...] At the recording of the new series of The Rob Brydon Show for BBC Two, Brydon asked if she would consider returning, to which Windsor replied, [...] "Never say never".|$|E
500|$|Heskey {{played as}} a forward, being a {{powerful}} targetman gifted with pace and physical strength; {{he is also}} a hard working player. His play has been likened to [...] "a blunt instrument with which to bludgeon defences". His main contributions to the team lie in the way he holds the ball up and draws defenders out, leaving space behind him for another player to score. He has been credited as being an unselfish player who allows other forwards to benefit. He is not a prolific goalscorer but is able to provide a significant number of assists as a second striker. He has been quoted as saying [...] "Forwards are judged on their goalscoring. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> think I bring a lot more to the game and I do get pleasure from assisting". He impressed the England staff with his versatility, as he can also play down the left wing. However, he has been criticised by the media for his lack of goals; lapses in his goalscoring have been described as being [...] "hardly uncommon". In 2008 it was stated that [...] "It is only the perception of his talents that changes" [...] after Heskey stated he was no better or worse than before.|$|E
2500|$|Lucas's output was prolific; by Max Beerbohm's {{estimation}} {{he spoke}} fewer words than he wrote. Lucas's Punch colleague E V Knox commented, [...] "Lucas's publications include many anthologies and about thirty collections of light essays, on almost any subject that took his fancy, {{and some of}} the titles which he gave to them, Listener's Lure (1905), One Day and Another (1909), Old Lamps for New (1911), Loiterer's Harvest (1913), Cloud and Silver (1916), A Rover I Would Be (1928), indicate sufficiently the lightness, gaiety, and variety of their contents." [...] He wrote travel books, parodies, and books about painters. Of the last he said, [...] "I know very little about pictures, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> write about them for the benefit of those who know less." [...] Frank Swinnerton wrote of him: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Miss Stackpole, [...] "I {{like to see}} all sides. I don't {{approve of}} a privileged class, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> hear {{what they have to}} say for themselves." ...|$|E

60|$|I said I {{would be}} ready at half-past six, and after she was gone, stood looking at the basket, quite lost in the {{magnitude}} of my trust. Ada found me thus and had such a delightful confidence in me when I showed her the keys and told her about them {{that it would have}} been insensibility and ingratitude not to feel encouraged.
