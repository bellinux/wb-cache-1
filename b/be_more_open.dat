For example, March 1 is designated as Self-injury Awareness Day (SIAD) around the world. On this day, some people choose to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> about their own self-harm, and awareness organizations make special efforts to raise awareness about self-harm. Some people wear an orange awareness ribbon or wristband to encourage awareness of self-harm.|$|E

5|$|The less {{stringent}} {{rules of}} the post-Hayes film industry allowed sexuality to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>open,</b> and cinema as a whole became more sexually explicit from the 1980s in particular, but aimed to purely to entertain rather than exploring underlying sexual dynamics. Much of the sex in speculative fiction film is merely intended to titillate; a review of fantasy films identified 10–15% as softcore pornography. but it remained rare to see gay characters in speculative fiction films. Horror films, that had sex {{as one of their}} major preoccupations, continued to be more leniently censored, due to the perception of being unserious and lightweight. Vampires in particular have been described as obvious erotic metaphors and as a result, numerous vampire films since the 1970s strongly imply or explicitly show lesbianism, following the inspiration of lesbian vampire story Carmilla. The prototypical Hollywood vampire, Dracula, was shown to be openly gay in the spoof film Does Dracula Suck? in 1969.|$|E

500|$|Initial {{photography}} {{started in}} May2008, and took place mostly {{in a warehouse}} in Burnaby, British Columbia. Each episode took around seven days to film, though some were completed {{in as little as}} five and a half. The first three episodes of the season were reshot from the original eight webisodes; the two-part premiere [...] "Sanctuary for All" [...] was reshot from the first four webisodes, while the third episode, [...] "Fata Morgana", was reshot from the final four. Eighteen months passed between shooting the web series and the first three episodes. Difficulties with this included the fact that Cainan Wiebe, who portrays Alexi, grew taller, and the actors consciously played the characters to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> to each other. It was filmed using Red One cameras, the first series in North America to use them. The Red camera system does away with tape and film and records straight to a hard drive, allowing Anthem Visual Effects and the series' post production team immediate access to the day's footage, and is capable of recording at 4K resolution—four times the resolution of current high-definition.|$|E
