25|$|After {{striking}} the ball Bradman used an exaggerated follow through, {{so much so}} that his bat would be swung <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> and along his spine, like a golfer. Most batsmen ended their stroke with their bat held high in the air, Bradman's method allowed him to hit the ball with greater power.|$|E
25|$|The statue was rededicated on October 19, 2012 by General John Mulholland. At {{the time}} of the {{original}} battle he was Lieutenant general and Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Special Forces Command. He dedicated the statue in its new location in front of One World Trade Center across from Ground Zero and 9/11 Memorial. The bronze statue was positioned so the soldier atop the horse is keeping a watchful eye as he looks <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> at the World Trade Center and its tenants. Soldiers representing the United States Army Special Operations Command attended the ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Other {{terms are}} used to {{describe}} the lion's position in further detail. It should be noted that each coat of arms has a right and left (i.e. dexter and sinister) side - with respect to the person carrying the shield - so {{the left side of the}} shield as drawn on the page (thus the right side to the shield bearer) is called the dexter side. The lion's head is normally seen in agreement with the overall position, facing dexter (left) unless otherwise stated. If a lion's whole body is turned to face right, he is to sinister or contourné. If his whole body faces the viewer, he is affronté. If his head only faces the viewer he is guardant or gardant, and if he looks <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> he is regardant. These adjectives follow any other adjectives of position.|$|E

60|$|Burton glanced {{into the}} window and looked <b>back</b> again <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> The lady, however, had disappeared.|$|R
6000|$|The sudden silence {{surprised}} Allan; {{he looked}} <b>back</b> drowsily <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> [...] "Thinking again!" [...] he exclaimed, with a weary yawn.|$|R
2500|$|... "The try Australia scored {{towards the}} end of the first half was relayed {{endlessly}} on television and, I predict, will be shown again and again in years to come. It was Lynagh, running towards the blind side, who set things in motion. Noticing that the New Zealand backs were lined up flat, he chipped the ball into the gap behind the winger. The New Zealand fullback, Kieran Crowley, was regarded by the Australians as being a little slow off the mark, and no doubt Lynagh had this in mind when he chose to kick in front of him. Campese was bearing down on the ball, and I think Crowley was undecided whether to go in for the ball or wait for the bounce and try to stop Campese. His slight hesitation gave Campese the fraction of a second he needed to scoop up the ball and flash past him. Campese's running then was superb. He drew two defenders and had a third one chasing him, all of whom thought he was a threat. Campese saw Tim Horan behind him out of the corner of his eye and flipped the ball <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Horan did well to catch it before going on to score." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Jarvis made a slow retreat {{towards the}} door. Every {{now and then}} he turned and looked <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
60|$|But the son gave no heed. Once {{he looked}} <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and his dark glance saw no one save Moore.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, as you like, madame, as you like," [...] {{said the}} king listlessly. At a sign from Mademoiselle Nanon a little peaky {{man with a}} shrewd petulant face, and long gray hair falling <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> entered the room. He bowed profoundly three times, and then seated himself nervously on {{the very edge of}} the stool, from which the lady had removed her work-basket. She smiled and nodded to {{encourage}} the poet, while the monarch leaned back in his chair with an air of resignation.|$|R
60|$|R.C. {{stepped out}} from behind the pine in full view. I crawled out, took a {{kneeling}} position, and drew a bead on the elk. I had the fun of imagining I could have hit him anywhere. I did not really want to kill him, yet what was the meaning of the sharp, hot gush of my blood, the fiery thrill along my nerves, the feeling of unsatisfied wildness? The bull eyed us for a second, then laid his forest of antlers <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and with singularly swift, level stride, sped like a tawny flash into the green forest.|$|R
60|$|White birds whisked {{in the air}} above, a shoal of parti-coloured fishes in the scarce denser medium below; between, like Mahomet's coffin, {{the boat}} drew away briskly on the surface, and its shadow {{followed}} it over the glittering floor of the lagoon. Attwater looked steadily <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> as he sat; he did not once remove {{his eyes from the}} Farallone and the group on her quarter-deck beside the house, till his boat ground upon the pier. Thence, with an agile pace, he hurried ashore, and they saw his white clothes shining in the chequered dusk of the grove until the house received him.|$|R
60|$|Looking <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> Pawnee {{saw them}} coming. To lessen {{the chances of}} being shot, he bent low over his {{faithful}} mare's neck.|$|E
60|$|From {{time to time}} Pan glanced <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> The flare of {{red light}} grew {{brighter}} and higher. One corner of Marco would surely be wiped out.|$|E
6000|$|Rodney looked <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> and {{perceived}} {{that they were}} being followed at a short distance by a taxicab, which evidently awaited his summons. Katharine saw it, too, and exclaimed: ...|$|E
40|$|Photograph of a Mexican gambler, ca. 1905. He is {{standing}} looking <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> right <b>shoulder.</b> He wears sandals, tight pants, a one-striped blanket <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> {{and a broad}} straw hat (or sombrero). He has a full moustache. He is {{at the edge of}} a garden in which there is much foliage. Behind that is a small building...|$|R

50|$|The USAF {{summary report}} of the {{accident}} investigation stated that, given {{the position of the}} F-104 relative to the XB-70, the F-104 pilot {{would not have been able}} to see the XB-70's wing, except by uncomfortably looking <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> left <b>shoulder.</b> The report stated that Walker, piloting the F-104, likely maintained his position by looking at the fuselage of the XB-70, forward of his position.|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and beckoned them to enter. Mr. Lorry got his arm {{securely}} {{round the}} daughter's waist, and held her; for {{he felt that}} she was sinking.|$|E
6000|$|... "Best not go {{far from}} camp alone, sir. 'T isn't above safe hereabouts," [...] {{he said in a}} low voice. I noticed that he glanced <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> as he spoke.|$|E
60|$|The maid, who {{had just}} returned, held the door open. Philip glanced <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Elizabeth blew him a kiss, a gesture which curiously enough brought a frown to Beatrice's face.|$|E
60|$|Lander now leaned <b>back</b> {{and looked}} <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> at <b>his</b> wife {{as if he}} might {{hopefully}} suppose she had {{come to the end of}} her questions, but she gave no sign of encouraging him to start on their way again.|$|R
50|$|At {{his prime}} during the 1970 - 90 period, Sergei Ignatov worked {{with up to}} 7 large balls in his performance, and 9 in practice. He {{frequently}} performed 11 rings in his act, and juggled them for 22 catches in his practice. Also in his show was 5 clubs. Ignatov is notable for his five club backcrosses, where he would throw the clubs crossing behind <b>his</b> <b>back</b> and <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> while walking in a circle.|$|R
6000|$|... "To-morrow morning, viper," [...] shouted Lupex, {{still holding}} his prey, but looking <b>back</b> at Eames <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Who the viper was {{had not been}} clearly indicated. [...] "When will he restore to me my wife? When will he restore to me my honour?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't {{recommend}} {{anything for}} the boy, I suppose?" [...] said my guardian, looking <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> half angrily; only half angrily, for he never seemed to consider Mr. Skimpole an accountable being.|$|E
60|$|After {{running a}} few steps, he glanced <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and then ceased running; the {{elephant}} {{was no longer}} in sight above the waggon, but had fallen an inert mass by its side.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is he?" [...] demanded Disco of Jumbo, whose {{enjoyment}} of the sailor's expressive looks was so great, that, whenever the latter opened his lips, the former looked <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> with a broad grin of expectation.|$|E
60|$|He {{led the way}} to the sitting-room. I had a new interest, now, {{in going}} back. Still, Lucilla's {{behavior}} hung on my mind. Suppose she treated me with renewed coldness and keener contempt? I remained standing at the table in the hall. Nugent looked <b>back</b> at me, <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "She has eighteen-pounders on {{the main}} and twelves on the poop, sir," [...] said the captain. [...] "She carries four hundred to our two hundred and thirty-one. Captain de Milon is the smartest man in the French service. Oh, Bobby boy, I'd give my hopes of my flag to rub my side up against her!" [...] He turned on his heel, ashamed of his {{momentary}} lapse. [...] "Mr. Wharton," [...] said he, looking <b>back</b> sternly <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> [...] "get those square sails shaken out and bear away a point more to the west." ...|$|R
60|$|And the Majors put {{up their}} men with great dexterity, {{and the word}} was given. They both fired, each at his adversary, but each without {{attempting}} to cover the other. Brown's ball whistled harmlessly away without approaching within any dangerous proximity of the Counsellor's body; but not so Webb's; it was very evident Jonas was hit, for his body gave a spasmodic jerk forwards, his knees bent under him, and his head became thrown <b>back</b> somewhat <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders.</b> He did not fall himself, but his hat did; he dropped his pistol to the ground, and inserted both his right and his left hand under the tails of his coat.|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> at {{the world}} they had left. The last of the Dreevers had rounded the clump of laurels, and was {{standing}} at the edge of the water, gazing perplexedly after the retreating canoe.|$|E
60|$|Jim did not speak; but {{pressing}} {{his lips to}} his sister's brow, leaped after his sire, who was standing an a remarkably vigorous attitude, with his legs wide apart and his arms akimbo, looking <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{are some}} landmarks,' {{observed}} Mr. Micawber, looking fondly <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> 'on {{the road to}} the tomb, which, but for the impiety of the aspiration, a man would wish never to have passed. Such is the Bench in my chequered career.' ...|$|E
60|$|The stout {{traveller}} walked {{towards the}} door and {{took a few steps}} up the passage. Then he stopped. All was quite silent, and he walked slowly to the end and looked down fearfully towards the glass partition which shut off the bar. Three times he made as though to go to it; then he turned <b>back,</b> and, glancing <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> came hurriedly <b>back</b> to the room.|$|R
60|$|At {{last the}} door was opened and he came forth. His face was inflamed, his eyes wild and blood-injected. He {{paused for a moment}} on the threshold, but I do not think that he noticed us at first. He looked <b>back</b> at her <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> still sitting at table, the outline of her white-gowned body sharply defined against the deep blue {{tapestry}} of the wall behind her.|$|R
5000|$|William Priestley {{was born}} in Basinghall Street, Leeds, in the manse {{associated}} with Mill Hill Chapel, where his father was minister. He was educated in Bristol in John Prior Estlin's school, before spending two years at Daventry Academy, his father's alma mater, 1787-89. William Priestley was a mild-tempered and softly-spoken bohemian with long brown hair thrown <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and a passion for nature and music. He was a proficient flautist, who spoke French and German, studied Anglo-Saxon texts, and read Norse mythology. He carved wooden chess-pieces, and sculpted clay models of ancient temples. [...] He was not inclined towards a career in commerce. His father, writing to a friend, regretted that William’s [...] "temper of mind and high spirit for life, will hardly suit trade." [...] In this, William and his father were very much alike, for, when he was nineteen, Joseph Priestley himself, had rejected a firm offer of a career in commerce; as a minister at Needham Market, his congregation had objected to Priestley's [...] "gay and airy disposition;" [...] and at Nantwich he {{had a habit of}} vaulting over the counter of the grocer's shop at which he lodged. [...] Regrettably some modern historians have misunderstood contemporary word-usage, and have read the clause: [...] "William's temper and high spirit, will hardly suit trade," [...] in a twenty-first-century idiom, mistakenly accusing William of being [...] "too high-spirited and hot-tempered;" [...] and erroneously denouncing him as the [...] "black sheep" [...] of the family.|$|R
