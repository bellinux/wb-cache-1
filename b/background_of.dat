Both digital and physical makeup was used for aliens.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the calculation of association, {{it is common to}} take into account any variables that could potentially confound the results.

Because of this association, studies must take account of the geographical and ethnical <b>background</b> <b>of</b> participants by controlling for what is called population stratification.|$|E
