Gore also called the Bush administration's Iraq war plan [...] "incompetent" [...] and described Bush as the most dishonest president since Richard Nixon. Gore commented; [...] "In Iraq, what happened at that prison, it is now clear, is not the result of random acts of a few <b>bad</b> <b>apples.</b> It was the natural consequence of the Bush Administration policy." [...] Rumsfeld was also criticized by both Republican and Democrat lawmakers, including Senators John Kerry, and Joe Biden, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.|$|E

40|$|Within {{a public}} good dilemma {{people have a}} {{tendency}} to follow the behavior of a single uncooperative individual (i. e., a <b>bad</b> <b>apple)</b> rather than the behavior of a single cooperative individual. The present research shows that this <b>bad</b> <b>apple</b> effect is stronger when a deviant individual is categorized as an ingroup member (i. e., when the <b>bad</b> <b>apple</b> is a black sheep) rather than an outgroup member. Furthermore, inconsistent with research on the black sheep effect, a deviant individual was evaluated more extreme when he or she was categorized as an outgroup member rather than an ingroup member. In addition, the present research demonstrates that the <b>bad</b> <b>apple</b> effect can be attenuated when there is a threat to be ostracized. That is, consistent with a functional perspective on ostracism, the possibility to be excluded from the group reduced the tendency to follow the behavior of a non-cooperative individual...|$|R

The evidence {{is that most of the}} time these riders are dealing with individuals from outside their team and the sport whether it be pseudo doctors and chemists who are promising them things. That has got to stop. More and more riders...are speaking out and it's the younger generation of riders coming in that are going to be the future of the sport. They have to come into a system that is completely ethically correct. But at the end of the day, the rider is the one who makes the decisions..We are in the process of changing that culture and it will change in time. We need to weed out the <b>bad</b> <b>apples.</b> I hope next year we have a Tour de France with no positive tests. We've had two bad Tour de Frances, we cannot afford a third." ...|$|E

He buys owls, too, and castles, and other horrible objects, made in bog-oak (that material which is not appreciated at Gad's Hill); and he is perpetually snipping pieces out of newspapers and sending them all over the world. While I am reading he conducts the correspondence, and his great delight is to show me seventeen or eighteen letters when I come, exhausted, into the retiring-place.

25|$|The results {{presented}} in the <b>bad</b> <b>apple</b> attack research paper are based on an attack in the wild launched against the Tor network by {{the authors of the}} study. The attack targeted six exit nodes, lasted for 23 days, and revealed a total of 10,000 IP addresses of active Tor users. This study is particularly significant because it is the first documented attack designed to target P2P file-sharing applications on Tor. BitTorrent may generate as much as 40% of all traffic on Tor. Furthermore, the <b>bad</b> <b>apple</b> attack is effective against insecure use of any application over Tor, not just BitTorrent.|$|R

40|$|This paper studies a <b>Bad</b> <b>Apple</b> {{phenomenon}} {{caused by}} Head-of-Line blocking in IEEE 802. 11 networks. This problem can adversely affect {{the performance of}} wireless multimedia streaming. We summarize {{the characteristics of the}} <b>Bad</b> <b>Apple</b> problem, and then propose a Station-Based Adaptation (SBA) algorithm to solve it. SBA maintains perstation information, operating at the MAC layer as an extension to 802. 11 DCF. SBA deactivates flows destined to temporarily unreachable stations, and later reactivates flow transmission when the stations are available. Simulation results show that SBA can effectively improve the performance and robustness of the 802. 11 system when stations experience unpredictable temporary failures that are several seconds in duration. ...|$|R

50|$|As of 2004, the {{marketing}} mascots are a care-free Jamaican cinnamon stick named CinnaMon and an accident-prone <b>apple</b> named <b>Bad</b> <b>Apple.</b> Labeled as Apple Jacks Adventures in print advertising, the commercials focus on CinnaMon upstaging <b>Bad</b> <b>Apple</b> by reaching {{a bowl of}} Apple Jacks before he can, {{in spite of the}} apple's attempts to stop him. Due to legal troubles, <b>Bad</b> <b>Apple's</b> antagonistic nature was dropped; Apple and CinnaMon were then portrayed as highly competitive friends, both getting into the bowl. The campaign was slated to be retired in 2007, and replaced by a retread of the 1990s campaign focused on children, but fan response to Apple and CinnaMon helped them remain as the mascots. In 2007, Apple and Cinnamon were fused together with Cinnamon sticking through the center of Apple with both of their legs at the bottom of their body. They remained this way for a few of the commercials until they became unstuck by a special machine. In 2009, Apple and Cinnamon were transported out of their cartoon world to the real world of New York City, where they continue to race each other to the bowl where they would enter the bowl at the same time.|$|R

As it is not a goal of Tor to protect against application-level attacks, Tor cannot be held responsible for {{the first part of this}} attack.

We call the second part of this attack the <b>bad</b> <b>apple</b> attack. (The name of this attack refers to the saying [...] "one <b>bad</b> <b>apple</b> spoils the bunch".
