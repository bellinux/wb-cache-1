2500|$|On January 11, 2008, DigitalGlobe {{released}} a satellite photo showing that a building {{similar to the}} suspected target of the attack had been rebuilt in the same location. However, an outside expert {{said that it was}} unlikely to be a reactor and could be cover for excavation of the old site. On April 1, 2008, Asahi Shimbun reported that Ehud Olmert told Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda during a meeting on February 27 that the target of the strike was [...] "nuclear-related facility that was under construction with know-how and assistance from North Korean technicians dispatched by Pyongyang." [...] On April 24, 2008, the CIA {{released a}} video and <b>background</b> <b>briefing,</b> which it claims shows similarities between the North Korean nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and the one in Syria which was bombed by Israel. According to a U.S. official, there {{did not appear to be}} any uranium at the reactor, and although it was almost completed, it could not have been declared operational without significant testing.|$|E

2500|$|Once the FBI {{discovered}} through Selbold that Duquesne {{was again}} in New York operating as a German spy, director J. Edgar Hoover provided a <b>background</b> <b>briefing</b> to President Franklin Roosevelt. FBI agent Raymond Newkirk, {{using the name}} Ray McManus, was now assigned to DUNN and he rented a room immediately above Duquesne's apartment near Central Park and used a hidden microphone to record Duquesne's conversations. But monitoring Duquesne's activities proved to be difficult. As Newkirk described it, [...] "The Duke had been a spy {{all of his life}} and automatically used all of the tricks in the book to avoid anyone following him... He would take a local train, change to an express, change back to a local, go through a revolving door and keep going on right around, take an elevator up a floor, get off, walk back to the ground, and take off in a different entrance of the building." [...] Duquesne also informed Sebold that he was certain he was under surveillance, and he even confronted one FBI agent and demanded that he stop tracking him, a story confirmed by agent Newkirk.|$|E
2500|$|Fox News, {{allegedly}} {{with the}} Administration's consent, identified and released a <b>background</b> <b>briefing</b> that Clarke gave in August 2002, at the Administration's request, {{to minimize the}} fallout from a Time magazine story about the President's failure to take certain actions before 9/11. In that briefing {{on behalf of the}} White House, Clarke stated [...] "there was no plan on Al-Qaeda that was passed from the Clinton administration to the Bush administration," [...] and that after taking office President Bush decided to [...] "add to the existing Clinton strategy and to increase CIA resources, for example, for covert action, fivefold, to go after Al-Qaeda." [...] At the next day's hearing, 9/11 Commission member James Thompson challenged Clarke with the 2002 account, and Clarke explained: [...] "I was asked to make that case to the press. I was a special assistant to the President, and I made the case I was asked to make... I was asked to highlight the positive aspects of what the Administration had done and to minimize the negative aspects of what the Administration had done. And as a special assistant to the President, one is frequently asked to do that kind of thing. I've done it for several Presidents." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fitzgerald's {{subsequent}} replies to reporters' questions shed further {{light on}} {{the parameters of the}} leak investigation and what, as its lead prosecutor, bound by the rules of grand jury secrecy, he could and could not reveal legally at the time. Official court documents released later, on April 5, 2006, reveal that Libby testified that [...] "he was specifically authorized in advance" [...] of his meeting with Judith Miller, reporter for The New York Times, to disclose the [...] "key judgments" [...] of the October 2002 classified National Intelligence Estimate (NIE). [...] According to Libby's testimony, [...] "the Vice President later advised him that the President had authorized defendant to disclose the relevant portions of the NIE [...]" [...] According to his testimony, the information that Libby was authorized to disclose to Miller [...] "was intended to rebut the allegations of an administration critic, former ambassador Joseph Wilson." [...] A couple of days after Libby's meeting with Miller, then-National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice told reporters, [...] "We don't want to try to get into kind of selective declassification" [...] of the NIE, adding, [...] "We're looking at what can be made available." [...] A [...] "sanitized version" [...] of the NIE in question was officially declassified on July 18, 2003, ten days after Libby's contact with Miller, and was presented at a White House <b>background</b> <b>briefing</b> on weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq. The NIE contains no references to Valerie Plame or her CIA status, but the Special Counsel has suggested that White House actions were part of [...] "a plan to discredit, punish or seek revenge against Mr. Wilson." [...] President Bush had previously indicated that he would fire whomever had outed Plame.|$|E
