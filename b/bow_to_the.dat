5|$|He played {{three of}} England four {{qualification}} {{games for the}} 1958 FIFA World Cup: a 5–1 victory over the Republic of Ireland, and the 5–2 and 4–1 wins over Denmark. On 15 May 1957, Matthews became the oldest player ever to represent England, when at 42 years and 104 days old he turned out for the victory over the Danes in Copenhagen. Despite calls by the press {{for him to be}} included in the 1958 World Cup squad, this time the selectors did not <b>bow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pressure. Yet at 23 years, nobody would ever enjoy a longer career with the England team.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 the {{nominally}} independent Whitechapel & Bow Railway received {{permission for}} a link from the District Railway at Whitechapel to the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT) at an above-ground junction at <b>Bow,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of Bromley station. The LT and District jointly {{took over the}} company the following year and the line opened on 2 June 1902 with new stations at Stepney Green, Mile End and Bow Road. Some District services were extended from Whitechapel to East Ham and one train each morning and evening ran through to Upminster. In July 1902 four trains an hour ran from Bow Road (2 to 3 from East Ham) to Ealing or Wimbledon and two trains an hour from New Cross served Hammersmith or Richmond. The outer circle continued to run from Mansion House, the GWR's middle circle having started at Earl's Court from 1900.|$|E

When {{the line was}} electrified in 1906 services to Richmond were withdrawn and the western termini became Hammersmith and Kensington (Addison Road), and to the east services were diverted from the ELR to Whitechapel, until the ELR was electrified in 1914 and services ran from Hammersmith to New Cross (SER) and New Cross (LB). The 6-car electric multiple units were jointly owned by the Met and GWR until 1923 when the GWR sold theirs to the Met.|$|E

5|$|In Serbia, Zaharije {{was persuaded}} by the Byzantines to revolt against Simeon. Zaharije was {{supported}} by many Bulgarians exhausted from Simeon's endless campaigns against Byzantium. The Bulgarian emperor sent his troops under Sigrica and Marmais, but they were routed and the two commanders beheaded, which forced Simeon to conclude an armistice with Byzantium in order {{to concentrate on the}} suppression of the uprising. Simeon sent an army led by Časlav Klonimirović in 924 to depose Zaharije. He was successful, as Zaharije fled to Croatia. After this victory, the Serbian nobility was invited to come to Bulgaria and <b>bow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new Prince. However, he did not appear at the supposed meeting and all of them were beheaded. Bulgaria annexed Serbia directly.|$|E
5|$|The {{governmental}} {{structure of}} the newly formed Confederate States of America was very much {{like that of the}} parent United States. The executive branch was partitioned into several departments, each headed by a secretary or equivalent who would advise the president. The constitution provided for a navy that would be directed by its own department, and President Jefferson Davis nominated Mallory to be Confederate States Secretary of the Navy. He was chosen for two principal reasons: first, he had extensive experience with nautical affairs, both in his boyhood home of Key West and later in Washington; and second, he was from Florida. In a <b>bow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> principle of States' Rights, Davis had to spread representation in his cabinet around among the seceding states. Although the requirement of geographical representation sometimes meant that the occupant would not be the best person available, the selection process worked well in Mallory's case.|$|E
5|$|The German {{flotilla}} {{had reached}} home ports {{on the evening}} of the 12 February. However, while the threat from RAF bombers in daylight had now gone, Bomber Command was soon making night bombing attacks on Kiel’s port. Gneisenau was moved into an inner basin alongside her depot ship, Monte Olivia. The hatches were left open and her tanks, still containing a large amount of fuel, were left unattended. RAF Bomber Command made its first attack {{on the night of the}} 25/26 February, when 61 bombers flew over Kiel. Monte Olivia was destroyed but Gneisenau escaped. On 26/27 February another 61 RAF bombers returned. A bomb penetrated Gneisenaus foredeck and exploded. The oil fumes from the tanks ignited and the ship was engulfed in fire from her <b>bow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Anton turret. The entire forward part of the bow needed to be replaced. She steamed to Gdynia, in Poland on 4 April where she was decommissioned out of range of RAF bombers. Gneisenau did not put to sea again. The raid cost three aircraft, one Hampton and two Wellingtons. German casualties amounted to 16 civilians and 116 sailors dead.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{aimed to}} {{elucidate}} dynamic {{effects of the}} Nuss procedure on the spine {{in the treatment of}} patients with pectus excavatum with asymmetric thoraces. MethodsTwenty-five patients with pectus excavatum who underwent the Nuss procedure were categorized into 4 groups by preoperative morphology of the spine and thoracic asymmetry. In group 1 (n =  8), {{the right side of the}} thorax was concave and <b>the</b> spine <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right. In group 2 (n =  4), the right side of the thorax was concave and <b>the</b> spine <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left. In group 3 (n =  5), the left side of the thorax was concave and <b>the</b> spine <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right. In group 4 (n =  8), the left side of the thorax was concave and <b>the</b> spine <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left. With computed tomographic data, finite-element models were produced to simulate each patient's thorax. Thereafter, dynamic response patterns of <b>the</b> spine <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Nuss procedure were examined. Validity of these biomechanical findings was verified by referring to clinical outcomes. ResultsIn group 1 and group 4 models, deformed spines were straightened; in group 2 and group 3 models, spinal bowing increased. These biomechanical findings were compatible with clinical evaluations. ConclusionsPerformance of the Nuss procedure for asymmetric pectus excavatum exerts dynamic influence on the spine. Response patterns of the spine are predictable from morphologic relationships between the asymmetric patterns of the anterior thoracic wall and the spine...|$|R

25|$|Fry's party {{trick was}} to leap from a {{stationary}} {{position on the}} floor backwards onto a mantelpiece; he would face the mantelpiece, crouch down, take a leap upwards, turn in the air, and <b>bow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gallery with his feet planted on the shelf.

There he speaks with the spirit of his father and is offered a prophetic vision of the destiny of Rome.|$|E
25|$|In {{the decades}} before 1856, {{want and need}} of a passage over the Ohio River was apparent. Commerce between Ohio and Kentucky could not {{continue}} unless some form of transportation was devised that did not <b>bow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> whims of mother nature. The distance from shore to shore was great and the steamboat traffic highly congested. The only solution that would not constrict traffic on the river even further was a wire cable suspension bridge of the type developed by French engineers. Several American engineers had begun designing and building suspension bridges. One of these men was John A. Roebling of Saxonburg, Pennsylvania. The Ohio River, however, was much wider than any river that had been bridged in France.|$|E
25|$|After the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah in 628, Islamic {{tradition}} {{holds that}} Prophet Muhammad sent many {{letters to the}} princes, kings, and chiefs of the various tribes and kingdoms of the time, preaching them to convert to Islam and <b>bow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> order of Allah. These letters were carried by ambassadors to Persia, Byzantium, Ethiopia, Egypt, Yemen, and Hira (Iraq) on the same day. This assertion has been brought under scrutiny by some modern historians of Islam—notably Grimme and Caetani. Particularly in dispute is the assertion that Khosrau II {{received a letter from}} Muhammad, as the Sassanid court ceremony was notoriously intricate, and it is unlikely that a letter from what at the time was a minor regional power would have reached the hands of the Shahanshah.|$|E

25|$|The waning {{loyalty of}} the Cossacks and the szlachta's arrogance towards them {{resulted}} in several Cossack uprisings against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth {{in the early}} 17th century. Finally, the King's adamant refusal to <b>bow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cossacks' demand to expand the Cossack Registry {{was the last straw}} that prompted the largest and most successful of these: the Khmelnytsky Uprising, which started in 1648. The uprising became {{one of a series of}} catastrophic events known as the Deluge, which greatly weakened the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and set the stage for its disintegration one hundred years later. Even though Poland probably had the best cavalry in Europe, their infantry was inferior. However, Ukrainian Cossacks possessed the best infantry during the middle 17th century. Since Poland recruited most of its infantry from the Ukraine, once this became free from Polish rule, the army of the Commonwealth suffered greatly.|$|E
25|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} through the game, new weapons are unlocked, {{each of which}} comes with its specific advantages. The player begins with a sword and shield, and a basic bow. The first new weapon is the Blades of Athena, dual swords which are considerably faster than the single sword. Later in the game, the shield is upgraded to the Shield of Medusa, and <b>bow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bow of Power. The player can also unlock completely new weaponry; a war hammer named Death-Biter, and a spear named the Spear of Achilles. The Death Biter is very strong, but slow, whilst the Spear has a long reach and deals moderate damage, but combos are difficult to execute. The player character also grows in strength as the game progresses. At {{the end of each}} level, he is awarded tokens which he can use to increase his damage, health and magic.|$|E
25|$|A devadasi's {{life after}} {{dedication}} was obviously very different centuries ago. Nowadays After dedication {{of a girl}} to the temple, she has to take bath every day {{early in the morning}} and should present herself at the temple during morning worship of Yellamma. She is not allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum. But she will <b>bow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deity from outside. Thereafter she sweeps compound of the temple. Every Tuesday and Friday she goes for yoga along with senior jogatis (yoga teachers). During this period she learns innumerable songs in praise of Yellamma and her son Parashurama. If she shows some aptitude to learn playing instruments she will be given training by her elder jogatis. In Yellampura and other villages Devadasis do not dance but this is performed by eunuch companions. The main functions of Devadasis would be singing and playing stringed musical instruments and Jagate. They form a small group and go for joga, from house to house on every Tuesday and Friday (Jogan Shankar, 1990).|$|E
