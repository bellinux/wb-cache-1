5000|$|The game's {{subtitle}} is The Story of Bubble Bobble III, {{which was}} also used as the subtitle for <b>Bubble</b> <b>Memories,</b> released in arcades in 1995. <b>Bubble</b> <b>Memories</b> is a prequel (given the [...] "Memories" [...] part of the name) to the 1994 game Bubble Symphony, which was released as Bubble Bobble 2 in some countries.

5000|$|One {{application}} was Konami's Bubble System arcade video game system, introduced in 1984. It featured interchangeable <b>bubble</b> <b>memory</b> cartridges on a 68000-based board. The Bubble System required a [...] "warm-up" [...] time of about 85 seconds (prompted by a timer {{on the screen}} when switched on) before the game was loaded, as <b>bubble</b> <b>memory</b> needs to be heated to around [...] to operate properly. Sharp used <b>bubble</b> <b>memory</b> in their PC 5000 series, a laptop-like portable computer from 1983. Nicolet used <b>bubble</b> <b>memory</b> modules for saving waveforms in their Model 3091 oscilloscope, as did HP who offered a $1595 <b>bubble</b> <b>memory</b> option that extended the memory on their model 3561A digital signal analyzer. GRiD Systems Corporation used it in their early laptops. TIE communication used it in the early development of digital phone systems in order to lower their MTBF rates and produce a non-volatile telephone system's central processor. <b>Bubble</b> <b>memory</b> was also used on the Quantel Mirage DVM8000/1 VFX system.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} {{was included in}} experimental devices from Bell Labs in 1974. By the mid-1970s, practically every large electronics company had teams working on <b>bubble</b> <b>memory.</b> Texas Instruments introduced the first commercial product that incorporated <b>bubble</b> <b>memory</b> in 1977. By the late 1970s several products were on the market, and Intel released their own 1-megabit version, the 7110. By the early 1980s, however, <b>bubble</b> <b>memory</b> technology became a dead end {{with the introduction of}} hard disk systems offering higher storage densities, higher access speeds, and lower costs.

40|$|The {{conceptual}} {{design of a}} highly reliable 10 to the 8 th power-bit <b>bubble</b> domain <b>memory</b> for the space program is described. The memory has random access to blocks of closed-loop shift registers, and utilizes self-contained bubble domain chips with on-chip decoding. Trade-off {{studies show that the}} highest reliability and lowest power dissipation is obtained when the memory is organized on a bit-per-chip basis. The final design has 800 bits/register, 128 registers/chip, 16 chips/plane, and 112 planes, of which only seven are activated at a time. A word has 64 data bits + 32 checkbits, used in a 16 -adjacent code to provide correction of any combination of errors in one plane. 100 KHz maximum rotational frequency keeps power low (equal to or less than, 25 watts) and also allows asynchronous operation. Data rate is 6. 4 megabits/sec, access time is 200 msec to an 800 -word block and an additional 4 msec (average) to a word. The fabrication and operation are also described for a 64 -bit <b>bubble</b> domain <b>memory</b> chip designed to test the concept of on-chip magnetic decoding.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{taxonomy}} of parallel sorting {{that includes a}} broad range of array and file sorting algorithms. We analyze the evolution of research on parallel sorting, from the earliest sorting networks to the shared memory algorithms and the VLSI sorters. In the context of sorting networks, we describe two fundamental parallel merging schemes - the odd-even and the bitonic merge. Sorting algorithms have been derived from these merging algorithms for parallel computers where processors communicate through interconnection networks such as the perfect shuffle, the mesh {{and a number of other}} sparse networks. After describing the network sorting algorithms, we show that, with a shared memory model of parallel computation, faster algorithms have been derived from parallel enumeration sorting schemes, where keys are first ranked and then rearranged according to their rank. Parallel sorting algorithms are evaluated according to a number of criteria, related not only to their time complexity, but also to their feasibility from a computer architecture point of view. We show that in addition to their attractive communication schemes, network sorting algorithms have non-adaptive schedules that make them suitable for implementation. In particular, they are easily generalized to block-sorting algorithms, that utilize limited parallelism to solve large sorting problems. We also address the problem of sorting large mass-storage files in parallel, using modified disk devices or intelligent <b>bubble</b> <b>memories.</b> Finally, the newer area of VLSI sorting is mentioned as an active and promising direction of research on parallel sorting...|$|R
