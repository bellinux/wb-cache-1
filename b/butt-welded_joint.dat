A fracture mechanics {{analysis of a}} <b>butt-welded</b> <b>joint</b> is performed by simulating radial crack growth in the inhomogeneous region of the pipe weld.

This can lead to a significant reduction in the lifetime of the pipe system...|$|E

40|$|Recently, troules {{have been}} {{experienced}} successively wherein {{stress corrosion cracking}} occurs to cause even a leakage of water during {{the final stage of}} the propagation of a crack while a nuclear power plant is in operation. The heataffected zone of circumferentially <b>butt-welded</b> <b>joint</b> between a pipe and a nozzle is said to have the most frequent stress corrosion cracking in the equipment commercially used. Assuming such risk, this paper discusses correlation between the notch dimension of stainless steel pipe with circumferential surface notch and burst criteria of pipes such as the burst pressure. The burst pressure of test pipes with circumferential notch does not show simple change against the notch dimension. Namely, if pipe has a partial circumferentially notch, a neutral axis moves and the pipe will receive stress by bending moment besides axial tensile stress due to internal pressure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{residual stress}} measurements {{and analysis of}} austenitic stainless steel pipe with a <b>butt-welded</b> <b>joint.</b> The measurements were done with neutron diffraction and strain gauge techniques. The measured results had typical characteristics of butt-welded pipe regarding both the decline of stress along the axial direction and the bending distribution of axial stress along the radial direction. The measured residual stress distribution by neutron diffraction was shifted more to the tensile side than that by the finite element method simulation. However, the measured radial and axial strains, except for the hoop strain determined by neutron diffraction, coincided well with analysis strains. The hoop strain was actually equivalent strain converted by a correction method because a different lattice plane had {{to be used to}} measure hoop strain. This might be one reason why the difference occurred. Therefore, future study of the correction method would be desirable...|$|E
40|$|Residual {{stresses}} {{induced by}} welding processes significantly affect the engineering properties of structural components. If the toe region of a <b>butt-welded</b> <b>joint</b> is modeled as a sharp V-notch, {{the distribution of}} the residual stresses in that zone is asymptotic with a singularity degree which follows either the linear-elastic or the elastic-plastic solution, depending on aspects such as clamping conditions, welding parameters, material and dimension of plates. The intensity of the local residual stress fields is quantified by the Residual Notch Stress Intensity Factors (R-NSIFs), which can be used in principle to include the residual stress effect in the fatigue assessment of welded joints. Due to the need of extremely refined meshes and to the high computational resources required by non-linear transient analyses, the R-NSIFs have been calculated in literature only by means of 2 D models. It is of interest to propose new coarse-mesh-based approaches which allow residual stresses to be calculated with less computational effort. This work is aimed to investigate the level of accuracy of the Peak Stress Method in the R-NSIFs evaluation...|$|E

During the immersions in distilled water and in salt water, specimens were covered with an oxide film and the joint strength decreased. In the salt water immersions, the strength of the SPCC base materials decreased. And a large reduction of the cross-sectional area of the A 1100 -O side of the joints was seen in the salt water immersions.

40|$|In {{fatigue design}} of welded joints, the local {{approach}} {{based on the}} notch stress intensity factors (NSIFs) assumes that the weld toe profile is a sharp V-notch having a tip radius equal to zero, while the root side is a pre-crack in the structure. The peak stress method (PSM) is an engineering, FE-oriented application of the NSIF approach to fatigue design of welded joints, which {{takes advantage of the}} elastic peak stresses from FE analyses carried out by using a given mesh pattern, where the element type is kept constant and the average element size can be chosen arbitrarily within a given range. The meshes required for the PSM application are rather coarse if compared with those necessary to evaluate the NSIFs from the local stress distributions. In this paper, the PSM is extended {{for the first time to}} <b>butt-welded</b> <b>joints</b> in steel as well as in aluminium alloys, by comparing a number of experimental data taken from the literature with the design scatter bands previously calibrated on results relevant only to fillet-welded joints. A major problem in the case of <b>butt-welded</b> <b>joints</b> is to define the weld bead geometry with reasonable accuracy. Only in few cases such geometrical data were available, and this fact made the application of the local approaches more difficult. Provided the local geometry is defined, the PSM can be easily applied: a properly defined design stress, that is, the equivalent peak stress, is shown (i) to single out the crack initiation point in cases where competition between root and toe failure exists and (ii) to correlate with good approximation all analysed experimental data...|$|R

40|$|If a {{weld toe}} is {{modelled}} as a sharp V-notch angle, the stress distribution near the notch tip is singular. Its intensity {{can then be}} quantified by means of Notch Stress Intensity Factors (NSIF), which have been proven {{to be capable of}} summarising the high-cycle fatigue strength of welded joints having very different global and local geometries. In presence of a singular residual stress field near the weld toe, the local load ratio is modified making the fatigue strength sensitive to residual stresses in the high-cycle regime. However, for an accurate estimation of the fatigue performance of welded joints, it is necessary to consider not only the initial residual stress field but also its variation under load, as both of these may play an important role. In this work the effect of fatigue loading on the asymptotic residual stress redistribution near the weld toe of a <b>butt-welded</b> <b>joint</b> is studied by means of numerical simulations.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the elastic and plastic stress fields induced by thermal loads in the {{vicinity}} of sharp V-notch tips in plates. Under the hypothesis of steady-state heat transfer and plane-strain conditions, the thermal and mechanical problem requires the numerical solution of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, obtained by extending the 'stress function approach'. The intensity of the stress distributions ahead of V-notch tips can be expressed in terms of thermal notch stress intensity factors (thermal NSIFs), as for external loads. The problem becomes much more demanding in the presence of transient thermal loads. The residual asymptotic stress distribution arising from the solidification of a fusion zone during an arc welding process is obtained by considering different boundary conditions. An aluminium <b>butt-welded</b> <b>joint</b> is analysed after having modelled the weld toe region as a sharp V-notch.

The analyses showed that compressive residual stresses due to welding increased the fatigue crack growth resistance of WM and HAZ owing to crack closure effects.

The weldments were prepared using each of two experimental "second-generation" GMA welding wires and a coated electrode. Fatigue tests were conducted using both sound weldments and weldments containing various internal defects, including porosity, slag, lack of fusion, and lack of penetration. Radiographic and ultrasonic testing techniques were used to study the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks originating at internal weld flaws. The fatigue {{studies have indicated that}} although the highest standards of quality may be used in the fabrication of HY- 130 (T) welded joints, it has not been possible to guarantee the elimination of all defects which have proven to be critical sites for internal fatigue crack nucleation under axial loading. Internal failures were as likely to occur in specimens rated as sound weldments under radiographic inspection as in weldments having regions containing readily detected flaws. Fatigue cracks originating at internal defects were found to initiate at approximately twenty to eighty percent of the total cyclic life-time of <b>butt-welded</b> <b>joint,</b> for tests conducted at a stress cycle of zero-to-tension. Within the normal limits of scatter for fatigue data, however, the number of cycles of crack propagation to failure beyond the point of internal initiation was found to be reasonably consistent at a specific test stress level, for weldments containing various types and percentages of weld defect area.

The amount and distribution of the input energy are basically controlled by the obvious and careful choices of welding process parameters in order to accomplish the optimal bead geometry and the desired mechanical properties of the quality weldment. The residual stress and welding deformation have the large impact on the failure of welded structures. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the required precision for welded structures, it is required to predict the welding distortions at the early stages. Therefore, this study represented 2 D Finite Element Method (FEM) to predict residual stress and strain on thick SS 400 steel metal plate. Findings: The experiment for Gas Metal Arc (GMA) welding process is also performed with similar welding condition to validate the FE results. The simulated and experiment results provide good evidence that heat input is main dependent on the welding parameter and residual stress and distortions are mainly affected by amount on heat input during each weld-pass. Practical implications: This present study on based on the numerical analysis using ansys software, for a thick multi-pass GMA welding. A birth and death technique is employed to control the each weld pass welding. Originality/value: The developed 2 D multi-pass model employs Goldak’s heat distribution, to simulate welding on SS 400 steel <b>butt-weld</b> <b>joint</b> with a thickness of 16 mm. moreover the numerical results are validated with experiment results...|$|R
