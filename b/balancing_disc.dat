40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{summarize}} the available evidence about total lumbar disc replacement (TDR), focusing our attention on four main topics: clinical and functional outcomes, comparison with fusion surgery results, rate of complications and influence on sagittal balance. Materials and methods: We systematically searched Pubmed, Embase, Medline, Medscape, Google Scholar and Cochrane library databases in order to answer our four main research questions. Effective data were extracted after the assessment of methodological quality of the trials. Results: Fifty-nine pertinent papers were included. Clinical and functional scores show statistically significant improvements, and they last at all time points compared to baseline. The majority of the articles show there is no significant difference between TDR groups and fusion groups. The literature shows similar rates of complications between the two surgical procedures. Conclusions: TDR showed significant safety and efficacy, comparable to lumbar fusion. The major advantages of a lumbar TDR over fusion include maintenance of segmental motion and the restoration of the disc height, allowing patients to find their own spinal <b>balance.</b> <b>Disc</b> arthroplasty could be a reliable option in the treatment of degenerative disc disease in years to come.

40|$|Abstract. Many {{balancing}} {{devices have}} been created to reduce machinery vibration especially in a high-speed rotor system which is very sensitive to the rotating mass unbalance. The best solution is that this device can self-perceive vibration changes and then respond these changes in an optimized way according to the different situations, which means it is a self-recovery system. According to this consideration, an electromagnetic driven bi-disc compensator for rotor auto-balancing is proposed here. In this system, rotor unbalance is online identified and calculated, after that the <b>balancing</b> <b>discs</b> will be driven to the best compensating positions, so that the unbalance can be suppressed or eliminated. Long transition time and transient vibration enhancement are terrible roadblocks which limit the industry applications of such auto-balancing system. To solve these deficiencies, a freely rotation bi-disc strategy was established and the solutions of two special cases were also discussed. A rotor auto-balancing test rig was build up. Experiments using the new solution on this rig showed that the electromagnetic compensator could be moved more accurate and effective, by which not only the balancing time was reduced, but also the transient vibration enhancement was avoided...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} {{of a model}} of the foundation of a rotary machine has been recently attempted by using the difference between two sets of response data at some of the bearing locations from two consecutive rundowns of the machine, with and without known unbalance weights at certain positions on the two <b>balance</b> <b>discs</b> of each rotor respectively. However, {{it would be a great}} advantage to be able to perform the estimation with a single rundown. Due to practical restrictions in performing such tests (accessibility, costs etc.), there are cases in which data for only one rundown are available. In this case, the unbalance configuration is unknown and has, therefore, to be estimated, in addition to the unknown foundation model. Due to the special form of the unbalance force, this overall inverse problem can be solved by eliminating the unbalance configuration from the model estimation process. The remaining equation to estimate the foundation model consists of the projection of the response data, where the associated projector depends on the foundation model parameter. First results using the method, applied to a laboratory test rig and to a commercial turbo-generator, are presented...|$|R
50|$|The nail delay {{involves}} <b>balancing</b> the <b>disc</b> on {{the nail}} (or occasionally teeth, feet, and elbows) {{in order to}} manipulate the disc’s position. The delay can be performed {{on the rim of}} the disc in vertical, angled, or centered/flat positions. Most players have a spin preference, preferring either clockwise or counterclockwise, but most players, especially advanced players can perform maneuvers with both spins. The delay is characteristic of more modern, technical freestyle, which uses the delay to perform more complicated maneuvers like turnovers and “against the spin” moves (manipulations that use angle and carefully applied friction to force the disc in a direction that its spin counteracts, a technique invented and mastered by Skippy Jammer).|$|R
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} distinctly freestyle disc maneuver was the tip, the act of quickly pressing fingers {{on the bottom of}} the disc to maintain or alter its position without catching the disc or letting it fall to the ground. Tipping first began in the early 70s, becoming more popular and refined by 1975. The tip, according to some histories, eventually led to the nail delay, considered by many to be the beginning of modern freestyle.The invention of the nail delay is disputed, but its first tournament appearance occurred when Freddie Haft performed the delay in the freestyle pairs event at the 1975 American Flying Disc Open (AFDO) in Rochester, NY. This was the first freestyle event held in the US. The nail delay involves <b>balancing</b> the <b>disc</b> on the fingernail while the disc continues to spin. This technique allows freestylers to change the flight path of the disc and perform numerous balletic and technical maneuvers such as restricted pulls, holds, turnovers, and shoots.|$|R

To evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes {{as well as}} radiological changes in distal unfused mobile segments and to evaluate factors that may predispose to distal disc degeneration and/or poor outcome. A total of 151 mobile segments in 85 patients (65 female), mean age 43. 2 (range 21 – 68), were studied. Curve type, number of fused levels and pelvic incidence were recorded. Clinical outcome was measured using the Whitecloud function scale and disc degeneration using the UCLA disc degeneration score. Spinal balance, local segmental angulations and lumbar lordosis were measured pre- and post-operatively {{as well as at}} the most recent follow up—mean 9. 3  years (range 7 – 19). A total of 62 % of patients had a good or excellent outcome. Eleven had a poor outcome of which ten underwent extension of fusion—five for pain alone, three for pain with stenosis and two for pseudarthroses. Pre-operative disc degeneration was often asymmetric and was slightly greater in older patients. Overall, there was a significant deterioration in disc degeneration (P <  0. 0001) that did not correlate with clinical outcome. Disc degeneration correlated with the recent sagittal balance (Anova F =  14. 285, P <  0. 001) and the most recent lordosis (Anova F =  4. 057, P =  0. 048). The post-operative sagittal balance and local L 5 -S 1 sagittal angulation correlated to L 4 and L 5 degeneration, respectively. There was no correlation between degeneration and age, pre-operative degenerative score, pelvic incidence, sacral slope, number of fused levels or distal level of fusion. Disc degeneration does occur below an arthrodesis for scoliosis in adults which does not correlate with clinical outcome. The correlation of loss of sagittal <b>balance</b> with <b>disc</b> degeneration may be as a result of degeneration causing the loss of balance or vice versa, i. e. sagittal imbalance causing degeneration.

DISC 1 is a hub protein {{of a network}} of protein–protein interactions involved in multiple developmental pathways within the brain. Gene set-based analysis has been proposed as an alternative to individual analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to get information from genome-wide association studies. In this work, we tested for an overrepresentation of the DISC 1 interacting proteins within the top results of our ranked list of genes based on our previous genome-wide association study of missense SNPs in schizophrenia. Our data set consisted of 5100 common missense SNPs genotyped in 476 schizophrenic patients and 447 control subjects from Galicia, NW Spain. We used a modification of the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis adapted for SNPs, as implemented in the GenGen software. The analysis detected an overrepresentation of the DISC 1 interacting proteins (permuted P-value = 0. 0158), indicative of the role of this gene set in schizophrenia risk. We identified seven leading-edge genes, MACF 1, UTRN, DST, DISC 1, KIF 3 A, SYNE 1, and AKAP 9, responsible for the overrepresentation. These genes are involved in neuronal cytoskeleton organization and intracellular transport through the microtubule cytoskeleton, suggesting that these processes may be impaired in schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we develop a {{mathematical}} model to describe the internal structure of an -accretion disc. The method is to consider the standard thin disc as a zero order approximation to a disc with vertical structure. The order of the approximation {{is controlled by the}} parameter 1 /M 2, where M is the Mach number of the azimuthal flow is a fiducial point. The theory is developed analytically as far as possible, using numerical solutions for the final system of ordinary differential equations only.;The model expands upon the work of other authors by assuming a disc surface defined by the condition of pressure <b>balance</b> between the <b>disc</b> and its environment. Vertically transported angular momentum is extracted by coupling to these surroundings. In the absence of an external couple, the vertical transport of angular momentum is ignored, as in the standard thin disc.;The internal structure and stability of the disc is investigated in both the gas and radiation pressure dominated regions, and the effects of including advection and the vertical transport of angular momentum is discussed. An application of the disc model is presented whereby external heating from X-rays associated with a radio jet are shown to induce mass loss from the disc surface. Such a configuration may undergo symmetry breaking to an asymmetric state in which one jet dominates. This is therefore a possible model for intrinsically one-sided radio sources...|$|R
5000|$|P-Factor is {{sometimes}} erroneously explained {{with the word}} [...] "bite", as in [...] "the descending blade has a bigger bite, or angle of attack, than the ascending blade". This faulty explanation {{does not take into}} account the forward motion of the blades as aircraft's angle of attack increases. In order to better understand this concept, imagine a propeller aircraft moving forward with a 90° angle of attack (vertical). This situation is identical to what a helicopter experiences, but a helicopter can reduce or increase the angle of attack of individual blades of the rotor (decreasing the angle of attack on the advancing blade, while increasing the angle of attack on the retreating blade) in order to keep the lift of the rotor <b>disc</b> <b>balanced.</b> Because the force of the air on the blades moving forwards through the arc is greater, they will produce more thrust than the blades that move backwards. If the blades of the rotor were unable to independently change their angle of attack there would be a constant backwards rolling motion due to the increased lift on the side of the rotor disc with the advancing blade. In a fixed-wing aircraft, there is usually no way to adjust the angle of attack of the individual blades of the propellers, therefore the pilot must contend with P-Factor and use the rudder to counteract the shift of thrust.|$|R
5000|$|By {{increasing}} {{the speed at}} which the disc is spun, data can be transferred at greater rates. For example, a CD-ROM drive that can read at 8× speed spins the disc at 1600 to 4000 rpm, giving a linear velocity of 9.6 m/s and a transfer rate of 1200 KiB/s. Above 12× speed most drives read at Constant angular velocity (CAV, constant rpm) so that the motor is not made to change from one speed to another as the head seeks from place to place on the disc. In CAV mode the [...] "×" [...] number denotes the transfer rate at {{the outer edge of the}} disc, where it is a maximum.20× was thought to be the maximum speed due to mechanical constraints until Samsung Electronics introduced the SCR-3230, a 32x CD-ROM drive which uses a ball bearing system to <b>balance</b> the spinning <b>disc</b> in the drive to reduce vibration and noise. As of 2004, the fastest transfer rate commonly available is about 52× or 10,400 rpm and 7.62 MiB/s. Higher spin speeds are limited by the strength of the polycarbonate plastic of which the discs are made. At 52×, the linear velocity of the outermost part of the disk is around 65 m/s. However, improvements can still be obtained using multiple laser pickups as demonstrated by the Kenwood TrueX 72× which uses seven laser beams and a rotation speed of approximately 10×.|$|R

The majority of INTEGRAL observations were made when the source was either at a very bright or very dim hard-X-ray state.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to examine the {{expression}} and regulation of aquaporin 2 (AQP 2), a tonicity-sensitive water channel in nucleus pulposus cells of the intervertebral disc. We found that AQP 2 protein was expressed in vivo in both rat and human discs. We determined whether AQP 2 promoter expression was regulated by osmolarity in a tonicity enhancer binding protein (TonEBP) -dependent manner. When TonEBP was suppressed under hypertonic conditions or overexpressed under isotonic conditions, AQP 2 promoter activity was correspondingly inhibited or induced. The role of TonEBP in controlling AQP 2 expression was confirmed using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from TonEBP-null mice. We studied whether calcium in addition to osmolarity played a role in regulation of AQP 2 in nucleus pulposus cells. We also determined whether both TonEBP and calcineurin–nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling contributed to ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, mediated induction of AQP 2. Co-transfection of AQP 2 reporter with calcineurin (CnA/B) and/or NFAT 1 – 4 vectors suggested that this pathway did not control AQP 2 promoter activity in nucleus pulposus cells. These findings were also validated using MEFs from TonEBP, fibroblasts from CnAα- and CnAβ-null mice, and mutant TonE reporter constructs. Results of these studies suggest that, in nucleus pulposus cells, osmotic pressure and calcium modulate AQP 2 expression through TonEBP and are independent of the calcineurin–NFAT pathway. Because calcium flux reflects a change in applied stress, the possibility exists that NFAT 5 /TonEBP modulate not just water <b>balance</b> in the <b>disc</b> but also accommodate applied biomechanical forces...|$|R

The dust emission features complement the information on the progenitor masses brought by the gas-phase N/O ratios: PNe with unidentified infrared emission bands have the highest N/O ratios, while PNe with the silicate signature have either very high N enrichment or close to none. We find a trend for a decreasing proportion of O-rich PNe towards the third and fourth Galactic quadrants. Two independent distance scales confirm that the proportion of O-rich PNe decreases from 30 ± 9 per cent inside the solar circle to 14 ± 7 per cent outside. PNe with warm dust are also the youngest. PNe with no warm dust are uniformly distributed in C/O and N/O ratios, and {{do not appear to be}} confined to C/O ∼ 1. They also have higher 6 -cm fluxes, as expected from more evolved PNe.
