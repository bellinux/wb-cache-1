5|$|His {{body was}} 'translated' (the ecclesiastical term for {{relocation}} of relics) from Jarrow to Durham Cathedral around 1020, {{where it was}} placed in the same tomb with Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne. Later Bede's remains were moved to a shrine in the Galilee Chapel at Durham Cathedral in 1370. The shrine was destroyed during the English Reformation, but the <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> reburied in the chapel. In 1831 the <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> dug up and then reburied in a new tomb, which is still there. Other relics were claimed by York, Glastonbury and Fulda.|$|E

5|$|By the 19th century, the {{graveyard}} was full {{and had become}} a public health concern. It was overrun with rats, and dogs chasing the rats, {{both of which were}} damaging the churchyard. Finding sufficient ground for new burials was increasingly difficult and <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> often removed to a nearby charnel house. In 1849, an extra charge was put on burials of people from outside the parish. In 1884, the churchyard was closed to all burials and a cemetery was opened in the town.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of K. aethiopicus {{have been}} found only in the Tendaguru Formation, dated to the late Kimmeridgian and early Tithonian ages, about 152 million years ago.

5|$|Hatzegopteryx {{was named}} in 2002 by French {{paleontologist}} Eric Buffetaut, and Romanian paleontologists Dan Grigorescu and Zoltan Csiki.

50|$|Cancellous <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> {{synonymous with}} trabecular or spongy bone. Cancellous bone {{has a higher}} surface area to mass ratio than {{cortical}} <b>bone</b> because it <b>is</b> less dense. This makes it softer, and weaker but more flexible. The greater surface area also makes it suitable for metabolic activities such as the exchange of calcium ions. Cancellous <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> typically found {{at the ends of}} long bones, near to joints and within the interior of vertebrae. Cancellous <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> highly vascular and frequently contains red bone marrow where haematopoiesis, the production of blood cells, occurs. The primary anatomical and functional unit of cancellous <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> the trabecula. The trabeculae are aligned towards the mechanical load distribution that a bone experiences within long bones such as the femur. As far as short <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> concerned, trabecular alignment has been studied in the vertebral pedicle. The macroscopic yield strength of cancellous <b>bone</b> has also <b>been</b> investigated, using high resolution computer models.|$|R
5000|$|Sesamoid <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> <b>bones</b> {{embedded}} in tendons.

5|$|In 2004 Lü {{and colleagues}} {{proposed}} that the articulation between the quadrate and quadratojugal bones in the skull of Nemegtomaia suggested that these <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> movable in relation to each other, which would have affected how the jaws functioned. In 2015 Christophe Hendrickx and colleagues found it unlikely that Nemegtomaia and other oviraptords had bird-like kinesis in their skulls, due to the quadrate bone being immobile.|$|E
5|$|Like other abelisaurids, the hindlimbs were stocky {{and short}} {{compared}} to body length. The tibia (lower leg bone) of Majungasaurus was even stockier {{than that of}} its relative Carnotaurus, with a prominent crest on the knee. The astragalus and calcaneum (ankle <b>bones)</b> <b>were</b> fused together, and the feet bore three functional digits, with a smaller first digit that did not contact the ground.|$|E
5|$|No Gun Ri villagers {{said that}} in later decades, two mass graves holding some victims' remains were disturbed, and <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> removed during a {{reforestation}} project, and by farming activity. In 2007, excavations at several places near the bridge turned up little.

5|$|Pennatomys nivalis was a {{medium-sized}} species without many distinctive adaptations. The nasal <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> short and blunt-ended. The zygomatic plate, a bony plate {{at the side}} of the skull, was broad. The bony palate was long and flat. The root of the lower incisor was housed in a bony protuberance, the capsular process. The molars were low-crowned and possess accessory crests such as mesolophs. The upper molars all had three roots.|$|E
5|$|The manus was {{composed}} merely {{of the five}} metacarpalia, which were orientated vertically and arranged in a semicircle. Carpal <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> missing, as in other titanosaurs. Finger bones and claws were also completely absent – in most other titanosaurs, these <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> still present though extremely reduced in size. In the foot, the talus bone was strongly reduced as in other titanosaurs, while the calcaneus was probably completely absent in Opisthocoelicaudia. In contrast to the manus, the foot showed well developed digits and claws. The phalangeal formula, which states the number of phalanges (digit bones) beginning with the innermost digit, is 2-2-2-1-0. Foot skeletons of titanosaurs are rarely found, and besides Opisthocoelicaudia, completely preserved examples are known only from Epachthosaurus and the unnamed La Invernada titanosaur, whose phalangeal formulas are 2-2-3-2-0 and 2-2-2-2-0, respectively. Of these three titanosaurs, Ophistocoelicaudia was the most derived while showing the fewest phalanges, indicating a progressive reduction in the phalangeal count during titanosaur evolution. The claw of the first digit was not larger than {{than that of the}} second digit, as in other sauropods, but roughly equal in size.|$|E
5|$|The {{site where}} the <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> found was largely {{untouched}} by paleontologists until around 1990, when excavations restarted. Remains of other dinosaurs, fish, turtles, and plants have also been found, including teeth belonging {{to a member of}} the Tyrannosauroidea. Other parts of H. missouriensis, including dental remains and part of a jaw, have also been found. The variety of faunal remnants found at the Chronister site suggest that a large body of water once existed close to the area.|$|E

It had been shot by whalers, but the harpoon had failed to explode. As with other mammals, the fundamental instinct of the whale was to try to carry on breathing at all costs, even though this meant beaching to prevent itself from drowning.
