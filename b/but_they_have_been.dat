5|$|Altogether, around fifty Christian {{artifacts}} {{were found}} in Hasekura's estate in 1640, such as crosses, rosaries, religious gowns and religious paintings. The artifacts were seized and stored by the Date fief. An inventory was made again in 1840 describing the items as belonging to Hasekura Tsunenaga. Nineteen books were also mentioned in the inventory, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> lost since. The artifacts are today preserved in the Sendai City Museum and other museums in Sendai.|$|E
5|$|Coyotes usually attack smaller-sized dogs, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{known to}} attack even large, {{powerful}} breeds {{such as the}} Rottweiler in exceptional cases. Dogs larger than coyotes, such as greyhounds, are generally able to drive them off, and {{have been known to}} kill coyotes. Smaller breeds are more likely to suffer injury or death.|$|E

5|$|Frome is {{reputed to}} have one or more systems of tunnels beneath {{the streets of the}} older parts of the town. Some entrances are visible above ground; for example in the wall at the top of Stony Street, with other entrances in the cellars of shops and houses. Their purpose and full extent remain unknown <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{investigated}} in recent years by at least one local group and a documentary has been made.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse {{have little}} {{interaction}} with people, primarily because most species live in arid unpopulated areas and at low densities. They are not generally sought after as game birds {{as they are}} not especially palatable, although they have on occasion been taken in great numbers at water holes. An attempt to introduce them into Nevada failed <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> introduced to Hawaii. No species {{is considered to be}} threatened although there have been some localised range contractions, particularly in Europe. A subspecies of the chestnut-bellied sandgrouse, P. e. floweri, was last seen in the Nile Valley of Egypt in 1979. It is thought to be extinct, but the reasons for this are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The two {{ecotypes}} of {{the common}} bottlenose dolphin within the western North Atlantic are represented by the shallower water or coastal ecotype and the more offshore ecotype. Their ranges overlap, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shown to be genetically distinct. They are not currently described, however, as separate species or subspecies. In general, genetic variation between populations is significant, even among nearby populations. As {{a result of this}} genetic variation, other distinct species currently considered to be populations of common bottlenose dolphin are possible.|$|E

60|$|Tarzan of the Apes, tensing his mighty muscles, {{strained}} at {{the bonds}} that pinioned him; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> re-enforced many {{times at the}} instigation of the Russian, so that not even the ape-man's giant brawn could budge them.|$|R
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the social {{behavior}} of H. suspectum, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> observed engaging in male-male combat, in which the dominant male lies on top of the subordinate one and pins it with its front and hind limbs. Both lizards arch their bodies, pushing against each other and twisting around in an effort to gain the dominant position. A wrestling match ends when the pressure exerted forces them to separate, although bouts may be repeated one after the other. These bouts are typically observed just before the mating season. Those with greater strength and endurance are thought to win more often and enjoy greater reproductive success. Although the Gila monster has a low metabolism and one of the lowest lizard sprint speeds, it {{has one of the highest}} aerobic scope values (the increase in oxygen consumption from rest to maximum metabolic exertion) among lizards, allowing them to engage in intense aerobic activity for a sustained period of time. Males have been observed to have higher aerobic scopes than females, presumably because of sexual selection for a trait advantageous in prolonged combat. The Gila monster may live up to 20 years in the wild, or 30 in captivity.|$|E

25|$|An {{index of}} {{qualitative}} variation (IQV) {{is a measure}} of statistical dispersion in nominal distributions. There are a variety of these, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> relatively little-studied in the statistics literature. The simplest is the variation ratio, while more complex indices include the information entropy.|$|E

25|$|The Akita is a powerful, {{independent}} and dominant breed, commonly aloof with strangers but affectionate with family members.
