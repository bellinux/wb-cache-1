Filming began on August 17, 2009 at Vancouver Film Studios and finished in late October, with post-production beginning early the following month. In April 2010, it was revealed that re-shoots of the film were needed. Slade, who previously said he would not <b>be</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> them, was seen, along with Stephenie Meyer, on set. The three main stars were also present.|$|E

25|$|He managed {{only one}} World Cup {{appearance}} though, after England failed {{to qualify for}} both the 1974 and 1978 tournaments. He finally reached a World Cup in 1982 when England got to the finals in Spain. He was duly named in the squad for the tournament but was suffering from a chronic back injury and was unfit {{to play in a}}ll of England's group games. In a last, desperate effort to play in a World Cup (he knew that he would not <b>be</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> the 1986 competition) he secretly hired a car and drove from Spain to a specialist he knew in Germany for intensive treatment. He recovered sufficiently to appear as a substitute for the last 26 minutes of England's final Second Round game against hosts Spain. Unfortunately, though, his brief experience of World Cup football saw him miss a point-blank header which would have broken the deadlock, in a game England needed to win to progress to the semi-finals. England drew the game 0-0 and were eliminated from the competition.|$|E
25|$|Luke is {{revealed}} to be keeping secret that the drug therapy is only a temporary solution, and Laura will eventually return to her catatonic state. Lulu is able to convince her cousin Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright) to postpone her marriage to Jasper Jacks (Ingo Rademacher), allowing her parents to use the supplies already in place. On November 16, 2006, Luke and Laura remarry on their 25th wedding anniversary. A drunken Tracy has {{to be removed from}} the ceremony, and scheming Maxie manages to sneak into the ceremony and catch Laura's bouquet, much like Scott had 25 years before. On November 20, Luke reveals that Laura's illness is no longer mental but physical and she will soon revert to her catatonic state. Laura decides she wants an early Christmas as she may not <b>be</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> the real one, and is able to comfort Lulu when she reveals the truth about her abortion. When Luke arrives with the tree, Laura is confused, confirming that her catatonia is returning. After being escorted back to the asylum, Laura reveals to her daughter that she doesn't think she really killed Rick Webber and asks her to prove her innocence. After saying goodbye to her family, Laura returns to her chair and sits with Luke as he tearfully watches her slip back into silence.|$|E

So I played with those two letters and the idea of the sea and finally came up with Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service – WAVES.

Mercado later compared Diana and Paul to Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard and her predecessor Kevin Rudd.

Kevin Rudd has just been forced to stand aside as Australian Prime Minister to avoid an embarrassing defeat {{at the hands of}} Deputy Leader Julia Gillard and now Neighbours Paul Robinson could be the next to go with a celebrated 80's superbitch infiltrating Ramsay Street".

500|$|In April 2002, Hewson {{was one of}} {{the leaders}} of an effort which {{delivered}} over a million postcards demanding that the facility be shut down; recipients included British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Prince Charles, and Norman Askew, head of British Nuclear Fuels Limited.

The Shut Sellafield Campaign had its postcards stocked in Superquinn and Dunnes Stores supermarkets, and Hewson publicly engaged Tesco when they refused to do the same. The campaign was backed by celebrities, including Ronan Keating and Samantha Mumba, and Hewson made many newspaper and radio appearances on its behalf. It was the first prolonged exposure Hewson had to the public eye, after two decades of mostly being focused upon maintaining her privacy. Her continued activism also meant that she too would not always <b>be</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> the couple's children.|$|E

500|$|Taylor cabled Washington to say [...] "I {{can well}} {{visualize}} [...] necessity {{at some time}} of using full U.S. leverage ... to induce our Vietnamese friends to get Khánh out of [...] position of commander-in-chief (from which he pulls the strings) and to install their very best governmental line-up." [...] He also told his State Department superiors that Khánh was very likely aware of his machinations, but {{that he did not}} care about this. At the same time, there was also the question of finding another military-appointed prime minister to replace Hương. Taylor wanted Nguyen Luu Vien, Huong's deputy, to take over, and advised South Vietnamese officers who were on good terms with him to try to engineer this, but they were not able to get enough support. Eventually, Phan Huy Quát was appointed prime minister on February 14. Quát was a moderate Buddhist not associated with the political demonstrators, and seen as a compromise candidate who would be acceptable across the religious spectrum, albeit grudgingly. He was also regarded as being favorable to Khánh, who would not <b>be</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> more than a few more days to support, control or pressure him in any case. All the while, intelligence reports of Khánh's attempted dealings with the communists increased.|$|E
500|$|When Phase II was {{discussed}} in the media, the return of Whitney as Rand {{was one of the}} things highlighted. Two weeks before the series was about to shoot, it was canceled by Paramount executives. Instead there was going to be a film. Whitney returned for , with Roddenberry bringing her back as Rand who was now the transporter chief on board the Enterprise. The film reunited the entire main cast of Star Trek. She didn't appear in , and wasn't in the script for [...] But for the latter film, Nimoy, who was directing the movie, gave Whitney a cameo as another character who was looking out of a window in spacedock watching the return of the damaged Enterprise at the start of the production. As he was also directing The Voyage Home, he was looking to give Whitney a larger role. By this time, she had hoped that Rand had moved over to become a counselor – an idea originally suggested by a fan. Alongside Majel Barrett as Christine Chapel, the duo were given four pages of dialogue initially which was trimmed down to one scene in the final film. Following the reappearance, Whitney was enthusiastic about returning as Rand, saying [...] "I think Janice Rand is going to <b>be</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> a long time, as long as they don't kill our characters off, we have a chance of constantly coming back." ...|$|E

The remix was heavily played in dance clubs, and Jerkins said he wasn't surprised with the popularity of it, since [...] " [...] reinvented herself.

[...] The song was well received by Vicky Newman from Shields Gazette, who felt that it demonstrates the group's [...] "stunning" [...] harmonies and allows their voices to [...] "shine".

John Earls from British newspaper, Daily Star, positively reviewed the single, calling it [...] "a winning formula," [...] in addition to awarding it a {{nine out of ten}} rating.

[...] "DNA" [...] was deemed [...] "amazing" [...] by Clemmie Moodie of the Daily Mirror. Eve Barlow for NME likened the song to Katy Perry's [...] "E.T." [...] and described it as [...] "a banger". According to Hackford Jones of music website, Pressparty, [...] "DNA" [...] is [...] "a storming slice of future-pop" [...] and [...] "a vibrant and commanding modern-day pop anthem that has the Little Mix personality stamped all the way through it." [...] Amy Gravelle of Entertainment Wise felt that the song represents the group's [...] "feisty charm". Gravelle also described the track as [...] "an infectiously catchy pop belter that proves the girls {{have what it takes to}} keep up with the best of their rivals." [...] Ciara Moore from The College View said that [...] "DNA" [...] won Little Mix a legion of teenage fans. Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman called the song [...] "bludgeoning, booming techno pop". 4Music's Trent Maynard said that [...] "DNA" [...] is a [...] "much darker turn for the cheery foursome, but just as catchy and polished as their previous single." [...] The song was described as [...] "an absolute gem" [...] by Lizzie Cox of Sugar. Rick Fulton of the Daily Record positively reviewed the song, awarding it three out of five stars. Fulton deemed the song as [...] "feisty electro fun" [...] and [...] "a bit harder than 'Wings'".
