A cut that is off-rhythm will be disturbing and you will feel it, unless you want it to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> On Jaws, each time I wanted to cut I didn't, so that it would have an anticipatory feeling — and it worked." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Push the Button" [...] was conceptualised after {{group member}} Keisha Buchanan {{developed}} an infatuation with another artist who was collaborating with Austin. Buchanan told Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian {{that she made}} advances towards the man, but {{he was unaware of}} her intentions: [...] "I really liked this guy, so I'd be like, there's this good movie coming out, you know, dropping hints. And he'd <b>be</b> <b>like,</b> <b>that</b> movie sounds great, let me know what it's like if you go see it. I knew he liked me too but he just wasn't getting what I was trying to say." [...] Austin advised Buchanan to tell the man to [...] "push that button" [...] or she would eventually move on.|$|E
500|$|Carl Sagan {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} Contact in 1979. The same year, Lynda Obst, one of Sagan's closest friends, was hired by film producer Peter Guber to be a studio executive for his production company, Casablanca FilmWorks. She pitched Guber the idea for Contact, who commissioned a development deal. Sagan and Ann Druyan (who later became his wife) wrote a 100+ page film treatment, finishing in November 1980. Druyan explained, [...] "Carl's and my dream was to write {{something that would be}} a fictional representation of what contact would actually <b>be</b> <b>like,</b> <b>that</b> would convey something of the true grandeur of the universe." [...] They added the science and religion analogies as a metaphor of philosophical and intellectual interest in searching for the truth of both humanity and alien contact.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with YouTube about Teenage Dream in August 2010, Perry revealed that [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] was the first song she wrote for the album after she finished her Hello Katy Tour (2009). Production and additional writing on the songs were done by Greg Wells, who previously worked with the singer on her second studio album, One of the Boys (2008). Perry considers it to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a two-part song because she had started working on [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] before she met Brand, and completed it after they began dating. She stated it is a [...] "really special" [...] song to her because, at {{the first part of}} the track, it is a story that she needed to let out, which was claiming to know something that you do not actually know. Perry later expressed relief at being able to put all of her feelings into [...] "Not Like the Movies".|$|E

500|$|Like {{many other}} African hip hop groups {{including}} Positive Black Soul, Daara J takes an activist stance. Faada Freddy states: [...] "We tell {{of peace and}} how we can live together because there are lots of conflicts going on nowadays. We're here on behalf of the Africans to remind everybody that it shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> There's always a solution. Rather than fussing and fighting we'd better learn to live in peace and live together, because that's the only way to survive." [...] The group is especially focused on educating the world about Africa. Faada Freddy has also stressed the importance of understanding life on the continent: [...] "Nowadays people are tending to show the negative part of Africa but Africa is not only about AIDS, heartache, corruption and all that even though it exists just like everywhere else. But Africa has a lot to provide." [...] In the Senegalese election of 2000, Daara J were involved in editing speeches for political leaders and the promotion of that year's campaign against corruption.|$|E
500|$|On July 19, 2012, Rapzilla posted {{an article}} {{entitled}} [...] "Is Lecrae and T.I. similar to Kanye vs 50 Cent?", which noted that [...] by T.I. {{was scheduled for}} release {{the same day as}} Gravity. The article speculated that the potential cultural impact of Gravity could <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of Kanye West after his 2007 competition with 50 Cent. The writer, Steven Patton, stated that [...] "we may be on the cusp of another watershed moment this coming September. Two artists living in Atlanta and largely the front runners of two different ideologies are releasing a new album on the same day." [...] A few hours after being posted, the article was updated stating that the release date for Trouble Man was being pushed back to September 19. However, the release date was subsequently returned to September 4, before T.I. announced that he was pushing the album back indefinitely. Trouble Man ultimately was released on December 18, 2012, and debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, selling 179,000 copies.|$|E
500|$|Following the match, Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier {{claimed he}} had a premonition that goalkeeper Dudek would be {{the hero of the}} final: [...] "I told Jerzy three days ago 'I can feel you will be the hero. You were too unlucky when we played them, today he was man of the match. But {{football}} can <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Sometimes you can be at the bottom and then be a hero again. I just had a feeling. I'm a great believer that when you have the right attitude everything else follows. He had a good run after the World Cup but then he made some mistakes and we had to support him. The squad get on very well. There was no finger-pointing after that game. He has saved us before in games and we had to keep faith in him." [...] Houllier also praised Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: [...] "I wished him the best in the Champions League because he represents the best in English football, he congratulated every Liverpool player after the final whistle and that shows that he is not just a great manager but a great man." ...|$|E

500|$|This chapter {{discusses}} Batesian mimicry, also mentioning {{observations and}} opinions of Fritz Müller and Wallace. Beddard grants that Bates's theory is very strongly {{supported by the}} observations that Bates made in South America, especially on butterflies, though again he tests the evolutionary explanation in different cases. He cites Wallace's rules of mimicry, such as that the imitators are always the more defenceless, and always less numerous, than their models, as covering all the examples he has given. However, he then states various objections, including that [...] "the Danaidae, themselves an uneatable race of butterflies and models for mimicry, resemble in South America the uneatable Heliconiidae". He points out that this does not meet any of Wallace's rules so it is [...] "not a case of true mimicry", but is [...] "supposed rather to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> which is seen between various other unpalatable animals". Müllerian mimicry is not mentioned explicitly in the book, though Beddard does write that this example [...] "tends {{to the advantage of}} the insects, for their enemies have to learn fewer colours and patterns, and thus are less likely to make mistakes, than if the lesson to be learnt were an excessively complicated one." ...|$|E

There were 15 rifles available, including type 38 rifles obtained from Matsue Middle School. The students, anticipating this possibility, had hidden the bullets.

2500|$|The {{character}} of Preston Burke was originally envisioned as a caucasian, {{to be played}} by Paul Adelstein, who starred in Grey's Anatomy spin-off Private Practice. However, due to his commitment to a film whose shooting dates changed, the actor had to drop out {{at the last moment}} and his character was rethought. Isaiah Washington was originally considered for the role of Derek Shepherd, which eventually went to Patrick Dempsey. Washington later received a callback from Rhimes to play Burke. He commented: [...] "I knew I could never be wrong in my heart about something so good and so genuine. Her writing just seemed very complex, very honest."
