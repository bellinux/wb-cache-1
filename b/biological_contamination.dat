40|$|Although Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) {{preparations}} {{have long}} history with successful applications, {{the scientific and}} systematic quality assessment of TCM preparations mainly focuses on chemical constituents and is far from comprehensive. There are currently only few primitive studies on assessment of biological ingredients in TCM preparations. Here, we have proposed a method, M-TCM, for biological assessment {{of the quality of}} TCM preparations based on high-throughput sequencing and metagenomic analysis. We have tested this method on Liuwei Dihuang Wan (LDW), a TCM whose ingredients have been well-defined. Our results have shown that firstly, this method could determine the biological ingredients of LDW preparations. Secondly, the quality and stability of LDW varies significantly among different manufacturers. Thirdly, the overall quality of LDW samples is significantly affected by their <b>biological</b> <b>contaminations.</b> This novel strategy has the potential to achieve comprehensive ingredient profiling of TCM preparations. </p...|$|R

One priority of the {{thematic area}} group is “early warning systems”, which aims at protecting the intake of drinking water treatment plants and drinking water networks from malicious or harmful events. Ideally, these systems trigger an alarm {{as soon as the}} quality of the source water or the drinking water differs from normality and, hence, allow the operator to supervise it and react properly, if necessary. A second priority deals with the analytical identification of “unknown” chemical and/or <b>biological</b> <b>contaminations</b> in drinking water following an incident. This rather analytical topic deals with screening methods used for the purpose of identifying and quantifying the individual contaminants rapidly as basis for risk/crisis/mitigation management.

2500|$|According to a 2002 {{report by}} staff from the Yemeni Environment Protection Agency, there were 10 {{wastewater}} treatment plants in Yemen {{at the time in}} Sana’a, Taiz, Ibb, Hajaa, Aden, Amran, Al Hodaida, Dammar, Yarem, and Radaa. Most of the plants use the stabilization pond technology, a low-cost technology particularly suitable for a hot climate. Some use Imhoff tanks or the activated sludge procedure commonly used in many developed countries. While data on the quality of treated effluent are limited, those data that are available show that the effluent of at least two plants complies with the relatively lenient national standard of 150mg/l of Biological oxygen demand, a measure of organic pollution. However, none of the four analyzed plants complied with the standard for fecal coliform, a measure of <b>biological</b> <b>contamination.</b> Reuse of treated and untreated wastewater in agriculture is common in Yemen. Wastewater from hospitals and medical laboratories is discharged into the sewer system, but cannot be adequately treated in the existing municipal {{wastewater treatment plants}}. The largest wastewater treatment plant in the country, located in Sana'a, was completed in 2000, but it had to be upgraded between 2003 and 2005 due to [...] "deficiencies in its operation, unacceptable odor emissions, and inadequate management of the generated sludge".|$|E
40|$|Decontamination {{treatments}} of surfaces are performed on albumin and brain homogenate used as models of <b>biological</b> <b>contaminations</b> in a low-pressure reactor, {{inductively coupled plasma}} operated with water vapor based gas mixture. It is shown that removal of contamination {{can be achieved by}} using pure H 2 O or Ar/H 2 O mixtures at low temperatures with removal rates comparable with oxygen gas based mixtures. Particle fluxes (Ar+ ions, O and H atomic radicals and OH molecular radicals) from water vapor discharge are measured by optical emission spectroscopy and Langmuir probe in several operating conditions. Analysis of particle fluxes and removal rates measurements illustrates the role of ion bombardment associated with O radicals, governing the removal rates of organic matter. Auxiliary role of hydroxyl radicals is discussed on the base of experimental data.

40|$|The {{application}} of electromagnetic (EM) waves {{to measure the}} electrical properties (dielectric constant and loss tangent) of materials is a well-known approach. The electrical properties {{can be used to}} indirectly measure several physical properties of solutions in water such as the concentration and chemical composition of contaminants in water, {{as a representative of the}} liquid phase in soil. A capacitive method of measuring dielectric properties of solutions is proposed to detect and determine low-concentration chemical and <b>biological</b> <b>contaminations</b> in water. The primary objective of this project is to design a low-cost sensor that would require small volumes of samples to detect low concentrations of dissolved contaminants in water. A forward model was developed using a finite-element method (FEM) to simulate the experimental setup (EXP). A calibration function was also developed to minimize deviations between FEM and EXP results for benchmark/reference solutions with known dielectric properties. The validated, calibrated forward model was then inverted to calculate the electrical properties of unknown solutions using the corresponding EXP results...|$|R

Impact assessment and significance evaluation are due for every human activity on the remote continent. While chemical and <b>biological</b> <b>contaminations</b> are widely studied, very {{little is known about}} the electromagnetic pollution levels. In this frame, we have evaluated the significance of the impact of Mario Zucchelli Antarctic Station (Northern Victoria Land) on the local geomagnetic field. We have flown a high resolution aeromagnetic survey in drape mode at 320 m over the Station, covering an area of 2 km 2. The regional and the local field have been separated by a third order polynomial fitting. After the identification of the anthropic magnetic anomaly due to the Station, we have estimated the magnetic field at the ground level by downward continuation with an original inversion scheme regularized by a minimum gradient support functional to avoid high frequency noise effects. The resulting anthropic static magnetic field at ground extends up to 650 m far from the Station and reaches a maximum peak to peak value of about 2800 nT. This anthropic magnetic anomaly may interact with biological systems, raising the necessity to evaluate the significance of the static magnetic impact of human installations in order to protect the electromagnetic environment and the biota of Antarctica...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{expansion}} of the urban population within Bertam river catchment in Cameron Highlands increased the input of organic matter to the river system. It originates from sewage and fertilizers, through point sources and non-point sources of pollution. This organic pollution causes very severe bio-contamination with bacteria and viruses, which can cause some serious diseases. On the other hand, {{it is apparent that}} an assessment of water quality cannot focus on chemical indicators alone, but must instead focus on indicators that integrate the effects of physical, chemical and <b>biological</b> <b>contaminations.</b> Therefore, in this research the pH, EC, TDS, COD, Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphor and E. coli at four points (SP 1 to SP 4) of Bertam river and five points (SP 5 to SP 9) of its tributaries were measured during average and high water flow to determine and specify the level of pollution in the river. Results show water quality of the Bertam river deteriorates and continues just after its origin at SP 1 as huge increase of total solids up to 4000 mg/L was observed during high water flow at SP 2 while it was around 5 mg/L at SP 1 in same period. Also the high concentrations of Total Nitrogen and Phosphorus was observed at SP 2 (17 mg/L N and 14 mg/L P) and SP 5 (9. 7 mg/L N and 8. 7 mg/L P) during high water flow. Finally, the presence of E. coli of more than 200 MPN/ 100 ml was found at SP 2, SP 3 and SP 7...|$|R
