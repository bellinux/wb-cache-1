2500|$|Corporate social {{responsibility}} (CSR, also called corporate conscience, corporate citizenship or responsible business) {{is a form}} of corporate self-regulation integrated into a business model. CSR policy functions as a self-regulatory mechanism whereby a business monitors and ensures its active compliance with the spirit of the law, ethical standards and national or international norms. With some models, a firm's implementation of CSR goes beyond compliance and statutory requirements, which engages in [...] "actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law". The <b>binary</b> <b>choice</b> between 'complying' with the law and 'going beyond' the law must be qualified with some nuance. In many areas such as environmental or labor regulations, employers can choose to comply with the law, to go beyond the law, but they can also choose to not comply with the law, such as when they deliberately ignore gender equality or the mandate to hire disabled workers. There must be a recognition that many so-called 'hard' laws are also 'weak' laws, weak {{in the sense that they}} are poorly enforced, with no or little control or no or few sanctions in case of non-compliance. 'Weak' law must not be confused with soft law. The aim is to increase long-term profits and shareholder trust through positive public relations and high ethical standards to reduce business and legal risk by taking responsibility for corporate actions. CSR strategies encourage the company to make a positive impact on the environment and stakeholders including consumers, employees, investors, communities, and others.|$|E
40|$|Abstract__ The multivariate choice {{problem with}} {{correlated}} <b>binary</b> <b>choices</b> is investigated. The Multivariate Logit [MVL] {{model is a}} convenient model to describe such choices as it provides a closed-form likelihood function. The disadvantage of the MVL model is that the computation time required for the calculation of choice probabilities increases exponentially {{with the number of}} <b>binary</b> <b>choices</b> under consideration. This makes maximum likelihood-based estimation infeasible in case there are many <b>binary</b> <b>choices.</b> To solve this issue we propose three novel estimation methods which are much easier to obtain, show little loss in efficiency and still perform similar to the standard Maximum Likelihood approach in terms of small sample bias. These three methods are based on (i) stratified importance sampling, (ii) composite conditional likelihood, and (iii) generalized method of moments. Monte Carlo results show that the gain in computation time in the Composite Conditional Likelihood estimation approach is large and convincingly outweighs the limited loss in efficiency. This estimation approach makes it feasible to straightforwardly apply the MVL model in practical cases where the number of studied <b>binary</b> <b>choices</b> is large...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Many {{research}} {{approaches are}} conceptualized as <b>binary</b> <b>choices,</b> representing endpoints of a spectrum (each of them providing important perspectives {{within their own}} discourses). Design and creativity are often conceptualized as being focused {{on one of these}} <b>binary</b> <b>choices,</b> thereby overlooking other possibilities. To better stimulate, enhance, and support creativity, our research has explored the middle ground between the endpoints defined by <b>binary</b> <b>choices</b> to identify “sweet spots ” based on a careful trade-off analysis of specific goals, objectives, stakeholders, and socio-technical environments. This paper illustrates some of the major trade-offs related to design and creativity that we have explored in our research over the last ten years, including prescriptive and permissive environments, individual and social creativity, communities of practice and communities of interest, and consumer and active contributor cultures. It briefly describes some of the socio-technical environments that we have developed to enhance creativity in specific contexts...|$|R

2500|$|The {{existence}} (or potential existence) of {{such large}} numbers of molecular species is a combinatorial phenomenon: It arises from a relatively small set of features or modifications (such as post-translational modification or complex formation) that combine to dictate {{the state of the}} entire molecule or complex, {{in the same way that}} the existence of just a few choices in a coffee shop (small, medium or large, with or without milk, decaf or not, extra shot of espresso) quickly leads to a large number of possible beverages (24 in this case; each additional <b>binary</b> <b>choice</b> will double that number). Although it is difficult for us to grasp the total numbers of possible combinations, it is usually not conceptually difficult to understand the (much smaller) set of features or modifications and the effect each of them has on the function of the biomolecule. The rate at which a molecule undergoes a particular reaction will usually depend mainly on a single feature or a small subset of features. It is the presence or absence of those features that dictates the reaction rate. The reaction rate is the same for two molecules that differ only in features which do not affect this reaction. Thus, the number of parameters will be much smaller than the number of reactions. (In the coffee shop example, adding an extra shot of espresso will cost 40 cent, no matter what size the beverage is and whether or not it has milk in it). It is such [...] "local rules" [...] that are usually discovered in laboratory experiments. Thus, a multi-state model can be conceptualised in terms of combinations of modular features and local rules. This means that even a model that can account for a vast number of molecular species and reactions is not necessarily conceptually complex.|$|E

Previous work has shown that the attentional drift-diffusion model (aDDM) can provide accurate quantitative descriptions of the psychometric data for binary and trinary value-based choices, and of how the choice process is guided by visual attention. Here we extend the aDDM to the case of purchasing decisions, and test it using an eye-tracking experiment. We find that the model also provides a reasonably accurate quantitative description of the relationship between choice, reaction time, and visual fixations using parameters that are very similar to those that best fit the previous data. The only critical difference is that the choice biases induced by the fixations are about half as big in purchasing decisions as in <b>binary</b> <b>choices.</b> This suggests that a similar computational process is used to make <b>binary</b> <b>choices,</b> trinary choices, and simple purchasing decisions...|$|R
