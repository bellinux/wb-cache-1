5000|$|Despite sharing {{numerous}} features {{found in}} other Northern Portuguese accents, the Povoan accent has particular features and includes influences from the region of Beira, in Central Portugal, that are not {{found in other}} Northern Portuguese accents, as in the pronunciation in connected speech as in os olhos which is spoken as oʒɔʎoʃ instead of ozɔʎoʃ. A distinctive feature of the accent, common in the fisher community, is the extensive use of open vowels where standard Portuguese uses closed or nasal vowels: it occurs in words ending with /a/, as in batata (<b>batatɛ</b> instead of bɐtatɐ); in the plural form, batatas, it is pronounced as batatɨʃ or batatɛʃ. Amanhã (tomorrow) is pronounced as amɛɲa, instead of ɐ̃mɐɲɐ̃. Currently, the urban population often pronounce it as amɐɲa. [...] "Ão" [...] termination is always pronounced as aɲ as in cão (kaɲ which can pronounced as kɔɲ in other Northern Portuguese accents and as kɐ̃ũ in Standard Portuguese.|$|E
