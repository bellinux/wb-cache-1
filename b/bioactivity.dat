As of 2008, {{the field of}} metagenomics was proposed to examine genes and their function in soil microbes, but most pharmaceutical firms have not exploited this resource fully, choosing instead to develop “diversity-oriented synthesis” from libraries of known drugs or natural sources for lead compounds with higher potential for <b>bioactivity.</b>|$|E
30|$|Using the kinetic {{analyses}} of UDP-Glc-dependent MrSGT, {{we were able}} to confirm the promiscuity of recombinant MrSGT, in contrast to the previously discovered bacterial SGTs. Exploiting this substrate flexibility, two new sterol glucosides, whose chemical structures have not been described before, were stereo-specifically biosynthesized, and their chemical structures were elucidated as fucosterol- 3 -O-β-d-glucoside and gramisterol- 3 -O-β-d-glucoside, respectively. Glycosylation of PSs with known <b>bioactivities</b> can augment the structural diversity of natural products and make it possible to expand the therapeutic applications of PSs by enhancing the known <b>bioactivities</b> or endowing them with new <b>bioactivities.</b> Further studies on the comparison of the <b>bioactivities</b> of non-glycosylated PSs with those of their PSG derivatives should be the direction of future research in this area.|$|R

25|$|TNF is {{primarily}} produced as a 233-amino acid-long type II transmembrane protein arranged in stable homotrimers. From this membrane-integrated form the soluble homotrimeric cytokine (sTNF) is released via proteolytic cleavage by the metalloprotease TNF alpha converting enzyme (TACE, also called ADAM17). The soluble 51 kDa trimeric sTNF tends to dissociate at concentrations below the nanomolar range, thereby losing its <b>bioactivity.</b> The secreted form of human TNFα {{takes on a}} triangular pyramid shape, and weighs around 17-kD. Both the secreted and the membrane bound forms are biologically active, although the specific functions of each is controversial. But, both forms do have overlapping and distinct biological activities.|$|E
25|$|As the {{amplitude}} of LH pulses increases, the theca {{cells of the}} ovaries begin to produce testosterone and smaller amounts of progesterone. Much of the testosterone moves into nearby cells called granulosa cells. Smaller increases of FSH induce {{an increase in the}} aromatase activity of these granulosa cells, which converts most of the testosterone to estradiol for secretion into the circulation. The remaining testosterone, together with adrenal androgens is responsible for the typical androgenic changes of female puberty: pubic hair, other androgenic hair as outlined above, body odor, acne. The <b>bioactivity</b> of testosterone is to a large degree limited by SHBG which in turn is mainly controlled by estradiol and prolactin levels (estradiol stimulates, prolactin decreases SHBG synthesis).|$|E
25|$|A {{synthetic}} polymer may be non-degradable or degradable. For {{the purpose}} of neural tissue engineering degradable materials are preferred whenever possible, because long-term effects such as inflammation and scar could severely damage nerve function. The degradation rate {{is dependent on the}} molecular weight of the polymer, its crystallinity, and the ratio of glycolic acid to lactic acid subunits. Because of a methyl group, lactic acid is more hydrophobic than glycolic acid causing its hydrolysis to be slower. Synthetic polymers have more wieldy mechanical properties and degradation rates that can be controlled over a wide range, and they eliminate the concern for immunogenicity. There are many different synthetic polymers currently being used in neural tissue engineering. However, the drawbacks of many of these polymers include a lack of biocompatibility and <b>bioactivity,</b> which prevents these polymers from promoting cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation. Synthetic conduits have only been clinically successful for the repair of very short nerve lesion gaps less than 1–2cm. Furthermore, nerve regeneration with these conduits has yet to reach the level of functional recovery seen with nerve autografts.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the antioxidant, antidiabetic and antihypertensive activities of peptides derived from rice bran proteins. Albumin, globulin, prolamin and glutelin were sequentially extracted from rice bran and the proteins were hydrolysed with four protease preparations, namely Alcalase, Neutrase, Flavourzyme and Protamex, {{for up to}} 240 min under their respective optimum conditions. The proteins were also subjected to an in vitro simulated digestion. Hydrolysate and digest samples were analysed for their antioxidant and α-amylase, α-glucosidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) -inhibitory activities. Hydrolysis of the proteins resulted in significant increases in these <b>bioactivities,</b> which were generally correlated with the degree of hydrolysis. In general, highest <b>bioactivities</b> were found with albumin and glutelin hydrolysates and digests, followed by globulin, while prolamin samples showed the lowest activities. Of the four enzymes used, Alcalase and Protamex-catalysed hydrolysates generally had the highest activities while Flavourzyme-produced hydrolysates had the lowest activity. The hydrolysates and digests were fractionated by ultrafiltration and ion exchange chromatography, and the <b>bioactivities</b> of the individual fractions determined. The fractions with MW< 3 kDa had the highest <b>bioactivities.</b> The net electric charge of the peptides also had a significant influence on the <b>bioactivities</b> of the peptides, but the effect was not consistent for the different <b>bioactivities.</b> Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was able to identify dozens of peptides in the most active fractions and search against the BIOPEP database revealed {{that most of the}} peptides contained amino acid sequences with known bioactive activities. Enzyme kinetic study showed that inhibitions of the peptides against both α-glucosidase and ACE were of the non-competitive mode. The strong inhibitory activities of rice bran protein hydrolysates against these enzymes suggest that they have the potential to be developed into dietary and nutraceutical supplements or used as functional food ingredients for managing related disorders...|$|R

Thus, the first [...] "vitamin" [...] <b>bioactivity</b> ever isolated, which cured rickets, was initially called [...] "vitamin A"; however, the <b>bioactivity</b> of this compound is now called vitamin D. In 1881, Russian surgeon Nikolai Lunin studied the effects of scurvy at the University of Tartu in present-day Estonia. He fed mice an artificial mixture of all the separate constituents of milk known at that time, namely the proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and salts. The mice that received only the individual constituents died, while the mice fed by milk itself developed normally. He made a conclusion that [...] "a natural food such as milk must therefore contain, besides these known principal ingredients, small quantities of unknown substances essential to life." [...] However, his conclusions were rejected by his advisor, Gustav von Bunge, even after other students reproduced his results.

2500|$|A loline {{alkaloid}} is {{a member}} of the 1-aminopyrrolizidines (often referred to as lolines), which are bioactive natural products with several distinct biological and chemical features. The lolines are insecticidal and insect-deterrent compounds that are produced in grasses infected by [...] endophytic fungal symbionts of the genus Epichloë (anamorphic species: Neotyphodium). Lolines increase resistance of endophyte-infected grasses to insect herbivores, and may also protect the infected plants from environmental stresses such as drought and spatial competition. They are alkaloids, organic compounds containing basic nitrogen atoms. The basic chemical structure of the lolines comprises a saturated [...] pyrrolizidine ring, a primary amine at the C-1 carbon, and an internal ether bridge—a hallmark feature of the lolines, which is uncommon in organic compounds—joining two distant ring (C-2 and C-7) carbons (see Fig. 1). Different substituents at the C-1 amine, such as methyl, formyl, and acetyl groups, yield loline species that have variable <b>bioactivity</b> against insects. Besides endophyte–grass symbiota, loline alkaloids have also been identified in some other plant species; namely, Adenocarpus species (family Fabaceae) and Argyreia mollis (family Convolvulaceae).|$|E

40|$|Context: Prenylated {{flavonoids}} are {{a unique}} class of naturally occurring flavonoids that exist {{especially for the}} plant’s self-defensive strategy. This special class of flavonoids increases the <b>bioactivities</b> of their backbone flavonoids with non-prenylation; therefore, prenylated flavonoids have more potential to be developed and utilized. Objective: The number, position and type of the prenyl group on the flavonoids backbone structure may have close relationships with the <b>bioactivities</b> of flavonoids. Methods: PubMed and WEB OF KNOWLEDGE® were used to search articles published in English between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2012, which discuss the structure–activity relationship between prenylated flavonoids and their <b>bioactivities.</b> Results: It is proposed that the prenyl-moiety makes the backbone compound more lipophilic, which leads to its high affinity with cell membranes. The prenylation brings the flavonoids with enhancement of antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cytotoxicity, larvicidal as well as estrogenic activities. However, it is reported that the prenyl-moiety decreases the bioavailability and plasma absorption of prenylated flavonoids. Conclusion: The prenyl group affects the <b>bioactivities</b> of flavonoids in certain ways, while the action mechanisms and the structure–activity relationship {{as well as more}} in vivo studies even clinical validation trials need to be further investigated.
