50|$|The Instituto de Pesquisas Ecológicas (IPÊ) {{began the}} <b>black-faced</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> {{conservation}} program in 1996 and through 2004 focused on learning the ecology and {{natural history of}} the species. In 2005, enough data was collected to create the first conservation action plan for the <b>black-faced</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> and its habitat. As well as collecting additional data, from 2005 to 2007 IPÊ completed a diagnostic of threats {{to the survival of}} the species. They then hosted the first Eco-Negotiation Workshop in Ariri (São Paulo) in 2009, with a focus on education and awareness of sustainable production. Currently some of their objectives include evaluating dispersal of young, refine the projected population, observe the effects of sea rise due to climate change, and promote sustainable harvest of heart-of-palm.|$|E

50|$|The {{reserve is}} home to 77 known species of mammals. Currently, the mammal {{population}} is threatened due to many reasons such as wildfires and poaching.The reserve {{is famous for its}} golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> (Leontopithecus rosalia), which represent most part of the few remaining wild golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> in the world. There is estimated to be 1000 tamarins in the reserve and surrounding areas. Currently the Golden <b>Lion</b> <b>Tamarin</b> Conservation Project (GLTCP) is attempting to save the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> from extinction.|$|R
50|$|Secondly, in {{an effort}} to save the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> from extinction, some of the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> have been removed from small, {{isolated}} unsafe forests and placed into a larger, protected forest; specifically they were moved to União Biological Reserve and Poço das Antas reserve. This effort to move the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> into União Biological Reserve in Brazil began in 1991. The golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> faced the potential of getting new diseases that they had not been previously exposed to. Many were exposed to callitrichid hepatitis, and contracted the disease.|$|R
50|$|The <b>black-faced</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> is an {{arboreal}} {{species and}} primarily eats small fruits and invertebrates such as insect, spiders and snails.

50|$|The <b>black-faced</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> or Superagüi lion tamarin (Leontopithecus caissara) {{is a small}} New World monkey of {{the family}} Callitrichidae. It is {{critically}} endangered and endemic to coastal forests in southeastern Brazil. There are several conservation projects and the total populations is unlikely to exceed 400 individuals. It is overall golden-orange with contrasting black head, legs and tail.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black-faced</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> {{has such}} a {{specific}} habitat preference and low population (400 individuals in total, of which approximately half are mature) that habitat loss is {{the greatest threat to}} the species. Agriculture, development, fragmentation and extraction of heart-of-palm are the leading causes for their habitat loss. It is also threatened from the illegal pet trade, hunting, increased tourism and inbreeding depression.|$|E
50|$|Public {{concerns}} of the tamarin species occurred in the 1960s when Adelmar Coimbra-Filho {{brought to the attention}} the rapid declines of the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> due to exportation and habitat destruction. His input helped with the establishment of the biological reserves to protect <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins.</b> He founded the Rio de Janeiro Primate Center and he {{was the first person to}} breed the golden-headed <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin.</b> From 1983-1994 large numbers of golden headed <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> were exported to Japan and Belgium as part of the exotic pet trade. IBAMA asked Jeremy Mallinson to form and become chair of an IRMC for the golden-headed <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin.</b> The initial objective of the committee was to have all of the tamarins returned to Brazil, and some of them were returned. The committees promotes <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> as a flagship species with the ultimate intent being the preservation of the unique Atlantic Forest, ecosystem and its many endemic plants and animal.|$|R
40|$|Here, {{we present}} {{a review of the}} dataset {{resulting}} from the 11 -years follow-up of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in free-ranging populations of Leontopithecus rosalia (golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin)</b> and Leontopithecus chrysomelas (golden-headed <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin)</b> from distinct forest fragments in Atlantic Coastal Rainforest. Additionally, we present new data regarding T. cruzi infection of small mammals (rodents and marsupials) that live in the same areas as golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> and characterisation at discrete typing unit (DTU) level of 77 of these isolates. DTU TcII was found to exclusively infect primates, while TcI infected Didelphis aurita and <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins.</b> The majority of T. cruzi isolates derived from L. rosalia were shown to be TcII (33 out 42) Nine T. cruzi isolates displayed a TcI profile. Golden-headed <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> demonstrated to be excellent reservoirs of TcII, as 24 of 26 T. cruzi isolates exhibited the TcII profile. We concluded the following: (i) the transmission cycle of T. cruzi in a same host species and forest fragment is modified over time, (ii) the infectivity competence of the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> population fluctuates in waves that peak every other year and (iii) both golden and golden-headed <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> are able to maintain long-lasting infections by TcII and TcI...|$|R

50|$|The <b>black-faced</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> {{lives in}} {{extended}} family groups with 2-8 members. Within these families there is normally only one breeding female per season.

5000|$|The <b>black-faced</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> was not {{recognized}} until 1990 when two Brazilian researchers, Maria Lucia Lorini and Vanessa Persson, described {{it based on}} individuals from the island of Superagui in the Brazilian state of Paraná.

40|$|An adaptive, {{evolutionary}} {{approach to}} animal intelligence predicts variation among species in cognitive abilities favored by different environments. Different foods present diverse {{spatial and temporal}} tracking problems for foragers, possibly favoring disparate learning and memory abilities in different species. <b>Lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> (Leontopithecus rosalia) and marmosets (Callithrix kuhli) differ markedly in feeding ecology. Marmosets specialize on gum, a plentiful and renewable resource, whereas <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> focus on ripe fruit, a spatially patchy and temporally ephemeral resource. <b>Lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> apparently need to remember the location and status of food sources for longer time periods than marmosets. I tested individuals of both species on two spatial memory tasks, a radial maze analog and a win-stay task. On both tasks, <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> remembered information about the location of food for longer temporal intervals than did marmosets, but marmosets performed better than <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> after very short retention intervals. A third spatial task showed that increasing memory loads did not differentially affect memory-based performance. On a color delayed match-to-sample task, both species required extensive training and performed poorly compared to the spatial tasks. As in the spatial tasks, <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> remembered information about the color of food sources for longer temporal intervals than did marmosets. The results of these four studies suggest that, relative to marmosets, <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> possess an adaptively specialized system for remembering the location, and perhaps color, of food sources. Differences in brain regions involved in spatial and object memory may underlie these species differences in memory. These studies suggest that diet has been a potent selective force {{in the evolution of}} memory in <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> and marmosets, and perhaps in other primates, including humans, as well. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{shares the}} {{experience}} of the Integrated Conservation Program for the <b>black-faced</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin,</b> Leontopithecus caissara, on measuring its conservation success. We present the program history and evaluate its impact from 2005 until 2014 in the Ariri region, at Cananeia, São Paulo, Brazil. To assess impact we combined an evaluation of the Econegotiation, a strategy that looks for involve various social segments into conservation through participative forums, with the Threat Reduction Assessment. Econegotiations analysis made possible to estimate the reduction of direct threats, which is considered the most difficult step in the application of Threat Reduction Assessment. We identified a 20 – 30 % reduction in threats, expressed by better political coherence and use of natural resources within the region. Our study revealed two factors that influence the success of integrated conservation and development projects: (i) the ability to integrate in the local context and influence it to make biodiversity conservation an interest shared by diverse actors and leaders, and (ii) the weight of our biocentric vision in defining the target condition constrains the calculation of Threat Reduction Assessment. As lessons learned, we highlight vital aspects to consider in conservation and sustainability: (i) initial effort to know the territory's social, cultural, and economic profile; (ii) clarity of direction and focus on the program's mission; (iii) consolidation of partnerships at all levels; and (iv) strategy to discuss, understand, and overcome conflicts, such as Econegotiations in the <b>black-faced</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> program, can act on critical threats and identify approaches and partnerships to reduce them...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on working with {{available}} information about biology, about conditions of population in free nature, about endanger and protection (mainly CITES, IUCN) of tribe called Callitrichidae. Then it valuates and elaborates the international trade based on information from the database CITIES during the years 1977 2013. Results are rated in case of business reasons, origin of specimen, structure of commodities, lands of import and export. Among the critical endagered species belong Leontopithecus caissara (<b>Black-faced</b> <b>Lion</b> <b>Tamarin)</b> with the estimated population in free nature of just only 400 pieces, Saguinus oedipus (Cotton-headed Tamarin) with the population in free nature about 6000 pieces. Trade with Common Marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), which is classified as not endangered, makes 81 % of the trade. Mostly reasons of this trade are commerce, science, zoo and medical reasons since 1990 s. Most of these pieces come from breeding in captivity and they are mostly samples and then living pieces. The biggest importers are USA and Switzerland. The biggest exporters are Germany and Great Britain.

40|$|The {{critically}} endangered <b>black-faced</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin,</b> Leontopithecus caissara, has {{a restricted}} geographical distribution consisting of small mainland and island populations, each with distinct habitats in coastal southeastern Brazil. Necessary conservation management actions require {{an assessment of}} whether differences in habitats are reflected in use of space by the species. We studied two tamarin groups on the mainland at Sao Paulo state between August 2005 and March 2007, and compared the results with data from Superagui Island. Three home range estimators were used: minimum convex polygon (MCP), Kernel, and the new technique presented dissolved monthly polygons (DMP). These resulted, respectively, in home ranges of 345, 297, and 282 ha for the 12 -month duration of the study. Spatial overlap of mainland groups was extensive, whereas temporal overlap was not, a pattern that indicates resource partitioning is an important strategy to avoid intraspecific competition. L. caissara large home ranges seem to be dynamic, with constant incorporation of new areas and abandonment of others through time. The main difference between mainland and island groups is the amount and variety of sleeping sites. A {{better understanding of the}} home range sizes, day range lengths, and territorial behavior of this species will aid in developing better management strategies for its protection. Additionally, the presented DMP protocol is a useful improvement over the MCP method as it results in more realistic home range sizes for wildlife species. Am. J. Primatol. 73 : 1114 - 1126, 2011.

5000|$|A {{study has}} shown that {{increased}} predation has caused significant decreases in the population numbers. A survey conducted in 1992 found the number of wild population of golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> to be 562 individuals in 109 groups. Currently, the average group size includes 3.6 to 5.7 individuals and densities from 0.39 groups/km to 2.35 groups/km. [...] These predatory attacks occur at the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> sleeping sites. The predators make those sleeping sites, which are mainly tree holes (about 63.6%), larger in order to attack the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins,</b> sometimes wiping out the entire family. The preferred sleeping sites of most golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> are tree holes in living trees next to other larger trees with {{a small percentage of}} canopy cover. These sleeping sites not only provide a place for sleep, but also offer protection and easy access to foraging sites. Most of the tree holes are lower to the ground, so they are easier to enter. Tree holes that are located in living trees are drier, warmer, and have a lower number of insects and therefore a decreased percentage of transmitted diseases. A smaller percentage of canopy coverage allows the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> to detect the predators faster, and being surrounded by other large trees allows them access to escape routes. Due to degradation of their habitats, there are fewer trees that can support entire social groups and some have to resort to using bamboo (17.5%), vine tangles (9.6%), and bromeliads (4.7%) as a sleeping site, making them more susceptible to predators. Golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> are known to use different den sites, but do not change sites often. They are more likely to reuse secure sites that will offer protection. However, the disadvantage of doing so is that predators are able to learn where these sites are located. Golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> also scent mark their den holes, so they can quickly return to them in the afternoon time when predators are most active. While excessive scent makes it easier for golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> to find their sleeping sites, it also helps predators locate their prey. Moreover, increased deforestation has decreased habitat space, providing predators easy access to their prey, causing a decline in the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> population.|$|R
50|$|The {{classification}} {{of the black}} <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> was debated, as one group of taxonomists classified the <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> by their geography, while other taxonomists placed them all into one species and then divided them into subspecies.

For differentiating within Leontopithecus, the black <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> is categorized as starting its call at the lowest note and going through the greatest range of pitch.|$|R
