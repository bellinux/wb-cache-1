50|$|Careful {{tailoring}} of the shockwave {{shape and}} intensity has also enabled the inspection of bonded composite structures via laser shocking. The technology, termed Laser Bond Inspection initiates a shockwave that reflects off {{the backside of}} a bonded structure and returns as a tensile wave. As the tensile wave passes back through the adhesive bond, depending {{on the strength of}} the bond and the peak tensile stress of the stress wave, the tensile wave will either pass through the bond or rupture it. By controlling the pressure of the tensile wave this procedure is capable of reliably locally testing adhesion strength between <b>bonded</b> <b>joints.</b> This technology is most often found in application to bonded fiber composite material structures but has also been shown to be successful in evaluating bonds between metal-composite material. Fundamental issues are also studied to characterize and quantify the effect of shock wave produced by laser inside these complex materials.|$|E

This method, called the Optimized Vertex Method (OVM), {{is based upon the}} vertex method but requires considerably fewer function evaluations. The method is demonstrated by calculating the response membership function of strain-energy release rate for a <b>bonded</b> <b>joint</b> with a crack. The possibility of failure of the <b>bonded</b> <b>joint</b> was determined over a range of loads. After completing the possibilistic analysis, the possibilistic (fuzzy) membership functions were transformed to probability density functions and the probability of failure of the <b>bonded</b> <b>joint</b> was calculated.

40|$|Several {{unexpected}} fatigue {{failures of}} polymer <b>bonded</b> <b>joints</b> used to repair damaged critical {{structures such as}} aircraft control surfaces have been reported in-service. The fatigue life and fatigue life scatter in polymer <b>bonded</b> <b>joints</b> {{was found to be}} highly dependent on the rate of stiffness degradation of the polymer adhesive layer under fatigue cycle. Since stiffness is a function of shape and boundary condition and not just material, this makes the static strength of <b>bonded</b> <b>joints</b> unsuitable for assessing and predicting fatigue life. The stiffness degradation of the polymer bonded joint led to in-homogenous strain hardening of the adhesive layer leading to eventual brittle fracture. The in-homogenous regional strain hardening in the polymer joint adhesive layer was caused by fabricated defects and anomalies. Residual strain effect was found in <b>bonded</b> <b>joints</b> after fatigue failure. This was extrapolated to reason {{that there may be a}} mean strain effect in adhesively <b>bonded</b> <b>joints</b> under uninterrupted fatigue leading to further research in this area.

A system, built up of a steel frame, a single glass pane and a flexible adhesive <b>bonded</b> <b>joint</b> across the full thickness of the glass pane was subjected to a concentrated horizontal in-plane load at the top. Experiments with square glass pane sizes showed that the system had a very small inplane stiffness, a glass-steel contact at large horizontal in-plane loads and a good residual capacity. The parametric studies by means of finite element models only focused on the variation of the geometry of the glass pane. The behaviour of the system mainly depends on the stiffness of the adhesive <b>bonded</b> <b>joint.</b> At larger horizontal in-plane displacements, systems with rectangular glass pane sizes have two glass-steel contacts.

40|$|The mean load of a {{cyclic loading}} {{has a large}} effect on fatigue crack growth rates in {{metallic}} materials and <b>bonded</b> <b>joints.</b> In metallic structures, this effect {{has been attributed to}} plasticity-induced crack closure, but {{little is known about the}} mechanism responsible for this mean load effect on fatigue crack growth in adhesively <b>bonded</b> <b>joints.</b> This paper presents a computational investigation of the plasticity-induced crack closure mechanism affecting disbond growth in adhesively <b>bonded</b> <b>joints</b> under fatigue loading.

It was necessary for such a numerical model to be independent of geometry of the structure and capable of considering different fatigue damage phases, of simulating the experimentally measured damage evolution and of predicting the effect of main fatigue loading characteristics. Three different adhesively <b>bonded</b> <b>joints,</b> namely the single lap joint, the laminated doubler in bending and the mixed-mode flexure specimen manufactured with the same adhesive system were considered for experimental and numerical investigations. The <b>bonded</b> <b>joints</b> were tested under quasi-static and fatigue loading and the failure responses of the <b>bonded</b> <b>joints</b> were studied experimentally and modelled numerically. To assess static and fatigue progressive damage in the <b>bonded</b> <b>joints,</b> experimental approaches, including backface strain and video microscopy techniques were employed. The effect of important fatigue loading parameters including the maximum fatigue load level and the load ratio on the failure behaviour of the <b>bonded</b> <b>joints</b> was examined experimentally. A cohesive zone model with a bi-linear traction-separation response was used to simulate the progressive damage in the adhesively <b>bonded</b> <b>joints.</b> This cohesive zone model was integrated with a damage mechanics based fatigue model to simulate the deleterious influence of fatigue loading. The proposed fatigue damage model was able to account for the effects of fatigue loading characteristics including the maximum fatigue load and fatigue load ratio.
