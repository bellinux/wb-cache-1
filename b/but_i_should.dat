25|$|This case tho' {{depending}} upon a practice not common {{in this country}} {{is by no means a}} difficult one. I have no doubt but that the error complained of might have been corrected by the same court upon motion, at a subsequent term; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not for that reason reverse the judgment, since the party having preferred a writ of error coram vobis had a right to proceed in that way, tho' a shorter, and much less expensive mode might have been pursued.|$|E
500|$|With {{the ninth}} issue, dated July 1, 1919, Hersey was {{replaced}} by Ronald Oliphant. [...] The reason he was replaced is not clear, though several explanations have been suggested. [...] Murray Leinster claimed that Hersey was fired for publishing too much of his own fiction and poetry in the magazine; according to Leinster, some of the poetry may have actually been written by Hersey's mother rather than by Hersey himself. [...] Pulp historian Richard Bleiler regards this theory as unlikely, since although up to eighteen of the twenty-five short poems in the first eight issues of the magazine may have been by Hersey, only two stories in those issues are definitely by him, and there are only four other stories {{which may have been}} Hersey's work published under a pseudonym. [...] Bleiler suggests that at most Street & Smith would have reprimanded Hersey, and that the real reason for his dismissal {{is more likely to be}} that Street & Smith were dissatisfied with The Thrill Book under his editorship. [...] Bleiler also suggests that Hersey may have started the rumor that he was let go for buying too much of his own material, as this would have been less harmful to his reputation than a dismissal for failure. [...] Hersey himself claimed that he was not fired, but quit: [...] "I wasn't fired, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have been... I saw the 'handwriting on the wall' ahead of time. [...] I asked to be relieved of my duties... and my request was promptly accepted!" ...|$|E

In her recap, she gave the performances high marks: [...] "Y’know, when I get so frustrated with OUAT, it’s because it sets a high bar up against itself. Like this episode, for example. It takes a classic myth, perfectly twists it into the show’s own purposes, and manages to be jaw-dropping in a single hour. I didn’t realize {{we were about to}} get so much out of “Nimue,” <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have guessed once we found out that it was penned by Jane Espenson, who writes most of OUAT’s best episodes." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the years}} as CIGS, Brooke had a stormy {{relationship}} with Winston Churchill. Brooke was often frustrated with the Prime Minister's habits and working methods, his abuse of generals and constant meddling in strategic matters. At the same time Brooke greatly admired Churchill {{for the way he}} inspired the Allied cause and for the way he bore the heavy burden of war leadership. In one typical passage in Brooke's war diaries Churchill is described as a [...] "genius mixed with an astonishing lack of vision – he is quite the most difficult man to work with that I have ever struck <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not have missed the chance of working with him for anything on earth!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{their opening}} drive, the Cowboys {{advanced}} to the Pittsburgh 38-yard line, with running back Tony Dorsett gaining 38 yards off 3 running plays. But they lost the ball on a fumbled handoff while attempting to fool the Steelers defense with a reverse-pass play. Receiver Drew Pearson later explained [...] "We practiced that play for three weeks. It is designed for me to hit Billy Joe 15 to 17 yards downfield. We practiced the play so much it was unbelievable we could fumble it. I expected the handoff a bit lower, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have had it. Billy Joe {{was in the process}} of breaking into the clear when the fumble occurred." [...] The play was similar to the near-turnover by Butch Johnson in the previous Super Bowl.|$|E

2500|$|In uncharacteristically bold discussions {{after dinner}} Darwin asked his guests [...] "Why {{do you call}} yourselves Atheists?" [...] When they responded that they [...] "did not commit the folly of god-denial, [...] avoided with equal care the folly of god-assertion", Darwin gave a {{thoughtful}} response, concluding that [...] "I am with you in thought, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> prefer the word Agnostic to the word Atheist." [...] Aveling replied that, [...] "after all, 'Agnostic' was but 'Atheist' writ respectable, and 'Atheist' was only 'Agnostic' writ aggressive." [...] Darwin smiled and responded [...] "Why should you be so aggressive? Is anything gained by trying to force these new ideas upon the mass of mankind? It is all very well for educated, cultured, thoughtful people; but are the masses yet ripe for it?" [...] Aveling and Büchner questioned {{what would have happened}} if Darwin had been given that advice before publication of the Origin, and had confined [...] "the revolutionary truths of Natural and Sexual Selection to the judicious few", where would the world be? Many feared danger if new ideas were [...] "proclaimed abroad on the house-tops, and discussed in market-place and home. But he, happily for humanity, had by the gentle, irresistible power of reason, forced his new ideas upon the mass of the people. And the masses had been found ripe for it. Had he kept silence, the tremendous strides taken by human thought during the last twenty-one years would have been shorn of their fair proportions, perhaps had hardly been made at all. His own illustrious example was encouragement, was for a command to every thinker to make known to all his fellows that which he believed to be the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{criticism}} of Amos Barton was mixed, with Blackwood's close friend W. G. Hamley [...] "dead against Amos" [...] and Thackeray diplomatically noncomittal. However, the complete Scenes of Clerical Life {{was met with}} 'just and discerning applause', and considerable speculation as to the identity of its author. Sales were no better than satisfactory, following a first printing of 1,500 copies, but Blackwood was none the less confident of Eliot's talent. Early reviewers deemed the writer [...] "religious, without cant or intolerance" [...] and [...] "strong in his [...] knowledge of the human heart". It was praised for its realism: one contemporary review noted approvingly that [...] "the fictitious element is securely based upon a broad groundwork of actual truth, truth as well in detail as in general". Due to its subject matter, it was widely assumed to {{be the work of}} a real-life country parson; one such even attempted to take the credit. Popular opinion in Eliot's home town attributed the work to a Mr Joseph Liggins, who attempted ineffectually to deny the rumours, and eventually accepted the undeserved celebrity. George Eliot's [...] "identity" [...] was revealed in a letter to The Times, but this claim was immediately refuted in a letter from Eliot herself. In 1858 Charles Dickens wrote to Eliot to express his approval of the book, and {{was among the first to}} suggest that Scenes of Clerical Life might have been written by a woman.I have been so strongly affected by the two first tales in the book you have had the kindness to send me, through Messrs. Blackwood, that I hope you will excuse my writing to you to express my admiration of their extraordinary merit. The exquisite truth and delicacy both of the humour and the pathos of these stories, I have never seen the like of; and they have impressed me in a manner that I should find it very difficult to describe to you. if I had the impertinence to try. In addressing these few words of thankfulness to the creator of the Sad Fortunes of the Rev. Amos Barton, and the sad love-story of Mr. Gilfil, I am (I presume) bound to adopt the name that it pleases that excellent writer to assume. I can suggest no better one: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have been strongly disposed, if I had been left to my own devices, to address the said writer as a woman. I have observed what seemed to me such womanly touches in those moving fictions, that the assurance on the title-page is insufficient to satisfy me even now. If they originated with no woman, I believe that no man ever before had the art of making himself mentally so like a woman since the world began.|$|E
