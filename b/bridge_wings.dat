5|$|Although the Vietnam Service Medal is a {{personal}} service award, it is permissible and customary under Coast Guard regulations for cutters to display service awards on the port and starboard <b>bridge</b> <b>wings.</b> Squadron One cutters were entitled to display the VSM by virtue of having served in Vietnam for more than thirty days during the eligibility period of 15 November 1961 to 30 April 1975.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnam Campaign Medal was {{an award}} of South Vietnam for those {{individuals}} who served in Vietnam {{for a period of}} at least six months. Although it was a personal award, Coast Guard regulations permitted its display on a cutter's port and starboard <b>bridge</b> <b>wings</b> since Squadron One's cutters served during the eligibility period of 1 March 1961 to 28 March 1973.|$|E

5|$|The {{armament}} changes undergone by {{the ship}} {{during the war}} are not entirely clear. Photographic evidence shows that four Oerlikon 20 mm AA guns were added, one pair to her searchlight platform and the other pair on the <b>bridge</b> <b>wings,</b> although Ottawa retained her 2-pounder guns even after the Oerlikons were added. 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased to at least 60 depth charges.|$|E
5|$|In August 1922, Tosa {{was moved}} to Kure, still incomplete. Fifty {{thousand}} people turned out to watch as the battleship was towed out of the harbor by five tugboats. The barbettes for the 406mm (16inch) guns were in place, but no turrets or weapons had been mounted, so {{the holes in the}} main deck were covered with a mesh-like material. Her hull was finished, and a superstructure deck, bridge deck and conning tower had been fitted, along with a light signal mast directly aft of the second barbette. The conning tower had to be outfitted as a bridge, as there was no other suitable location; compared with those of similar ships, it was much smaller, as it only contained two levels and <b>bridge</b> <b>wings.</b> An exhaust pipe resembling an extremely small funnel was fitted so that heat could be supplied within the ship.|$|E
5|$|In January 2006 Queen Mary 2 {{embarked}} on a circumnavigation of South America. Upon departure from Fort Lauderdale, one of her propeller pods was damaged when it struck a channel wall, forcing the ship to sail at a reduced speed, which resulted in Commodore Warwick's decision to skip several calls on its voyage to Rio de Janeiro. Many of her passengers threatened to stage a sit-in protest because of the missed calls, before Cunard offered to refund the voyage costs. Queen Mary 2 continued to operate at a reduced service speed and several itinerary changes were necessary until repairs had been completed after the ship returned to Europe in June, where Queen Mary 2 {{paid a visit to}} dry dock and the damaged propeller pod was unseated. In November, Queen Mary 2 was drydocked once more at the Blohm + Voss yard in Hamburg (drydock Elbe 17) for the reinstallation of the repaired propeller pod. At the same time, sprinkler systems were installed in all of the vessel's balconies to comply with new safety regulations which had come into effect since the MS Star Princess fire. Additionally, both <b>bridge</b> <b>wings</b> were extended by two metres to improve visibility.|$|E

25|$|During the December 1942 repair at Mare Island, it was {{necessary}} to extensively rebuild the bridge. The <b>bridge</b> <b>wings</b> were removed as part of that repair, and are now part of a memorial to the ship on a promontory in Lands End, San Francisco at Golden Gate National Recreation Area overlooking the Pacific Ocean. One wing has extensive battle damage from the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. They are set on the great circle course from San Francisco to Guadalcanal. The old ship's bell is housed at the Marines Memorial Club in San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|Each {{cabin on}} the ship was {{completely}} pre-fabricated, with complete furnishing and soundproofing, and individually installed on board the ship. The ship was originally built with spacious cabins, all of which include illuminated closets, colour television and a VCR, with many cabins equipped with a bathtub. The 1999 refit added six suites {{in the place of}} former officers' cabins, while six balconies were added to the existing suites under the <b>bridge</b> <b>wings.</b> During the 2011/2012 refit, a small number of balcony cabins were created aft, while a considerable number of existing midships cabins were fitted with small French balconies.|$|E
25|$|Ville de Québec {{was ordered}} {{as part of}} the Revised 1940–41 Flower-class {{building}} program. This revised program radically changed the look of the Flower-class corvette. The ships of this program kept the water-tube boilers of the initial 1940–41 program, but now they were housed in separate compartments for safety. The fo'c'sle was extended, which allowed more space for berths for the crew, leading to an expansion of the crew. The bow had increased flare for better control in heavy seas. The revised Flowers of the RCN received an additional two depth charge throwers fitted amidships and more depth charges. They also came with heavier secondary armament with 20mm anti-aircraft guns carried on the extended <b>bridge</b> <b>wings.</b> All this led to an increase in displacement, draught and length.|$|E

50|$|Boxer was {{constructed}} at Ingalls Shipbuilding, Pascagoula, Mississippi, launched 13 August 1993, and commissioned 11 February 1995. She immediately left for San Diego, California via the Panama Canal and, {{although she was}} designed to fit the Canal, her <b>bridge</b> <b>wing</b> and other smaller components were sheared off in the transit.|$|R
25|$|In many ways, Otso was a {{significant}} departure from the traditional Finnish icebreaker design. The extended <b>bridge</b> <b>wings</b> on top of the stylish superstructure feature full-depth all-round windows that provide almost 360 degree visibility from the main steering position, which has been moved to the starboard bridge wing from the centerline. Furthermore, the traditional colours dating back to the Imperial Russian era, yellow and black, were replaced with the colors of the flag of Finland, blue and white. Due to the extensive use of advanced automation, which allowed everything ranging from starting and stopping the main engines to raising and lowering the flag to be done remotely from the bridge, Otso had the smallest crew among Finnish state-owned icebreakers when she entered service in 1986. Later her crew has been further reduced to 20. Otso was also the first icebreaker in which the lifeboats, unusable in ice-infested waters, were replaced with inflatable life rafts that could be lowered on the ice.|$|E

500|$|Fredericton {{was armed}} with one [...] gun forward and a [...] pom-pom gun mounted aft. Two Oerlikon [...] cannon were {{mounted on the}} <b>bridge</b> <b>wings</b> for air defence. Depth charges, which were rolled from the stern through two ports or thrown from four {{launchers}} aft were used for anti-submarine warfare. Later in the war, she was outfitted with the more effective Hedgehog depth bomb throwers.|$|E
50|$|During {{the raid}} the port <b>bridge</b> <b>wing</b> gun crew opened up on Hansons port side {{at what they}} thought was a small boat, {{but it turned out to}} be a crew member of another {{destroyer}} smoking a cigarette.

They had a theoretical ceiling of [...]|$|E
500|$|During the war the two single Oerlikon mounts on the <b>bridge</b> <b>wings</b> were {{replaced}} by twin power-driven mounts and the two remaining single mounts aft were superseded by two single [...] Bofors AA guns before the ship sailed for the Far East. In preparation for her reclassification as a training ship, Pietermaritzburg had her sweeping gear removed and was rearmed with her main armament replaced by a twin-gun turret fitted with more powerful 4-inch Mk XVI guns in 1961–62. The Bofors guns were moved {{to the roof of}} the enlarged aft superstructure. Her complement now consisted of 8 officers, 73 ratings, 10 midshipmen and 50 trainees. She was refitted in 1971.|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for her reclassification as a despatch vessel/training ship in 1955, Good Hopes Oerlikons {{were replaced by}} a pair of [...] Bofors light AA guns on the Squid deck forward of the <b>bridge</b> <b>wings</b> and her depth charges and their gear was removed. This allowed the ship's forecastle deck to be extended right aft to add more accommodations and it was covered in teak above the new compartments. Its bridge was enlarged and a new mainmast was added. During her refit in early 1958, Good Hopes main armament was replaced by a twin-gun turret fitted with more powerful four-inch Mk XVI guns. She was refitted in 1961.|$|E
50|$|On the 27 October 2012 the Pride of Burgundy {{collided}} with Berlioz resulting in damage to her lifeboats, which meant {{the ship had}} to be pulled out of service. The Pride of Burgundy sustained damage to her right <b>bridge</b> <b>wing</b> which was fixed {{in a couple of}} hours. All passengers due to travel on the Berlioz were transferred to her sister-ship Rodin.|$|R
5000|$|The {{chronometer}} {{is designed}} to operate {{for a minimum of}} 1 year on a single set of batteries. Observations may be timed and ship's clocks set with a comparing watch, which is set to chronometer time and taken to the <b>bridge</b> <b>wing</b> for recording sight times.
