40|$|With {{advances}} in the <b>business</b> <b>intelligence</b> area, there is an increasing interest for the introduction of <b>business</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>systems</b> into organizations. Although the opinion about <b>business</b> <b>intelligence</b> and its creation of business value is generally accepted, economic justification of investments into <b>business</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>systems</b> is not always clear. Measuring the business value of <b>business</b> <b>intelligence</b> in practice is often not carried out {{due to the lack}} of measurement methods and resources. Even though the perceived benefits from <b>business</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>systems,</b> in terms of better information quality or achievement of information quality improvement goals, are far from being neglected, these are only indirect business benefits or the business value of such systems. The true business value of <b>business</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>systems</b> hides in improved business processes and thus in improved business performance. The aim of the paper is to propose a conceptual model to assess business value of <b>business</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>systems</b> that was developed on extensive literature review, in-depth interviews, and case study analysis for researching <b>business</b> <b>intelligence</b> systems’ absorbability capabilities or key factors facilitating usage of quality information provided by such systems respectively...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To better {{understand}} the impact of <b>Business</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>systems</b> on organizations’ effectiveness. Methodology: Critical and descriptive literature review. Findings: On the basis of numerous case studies described in literature and pertaining to various types of enterprises, different industries and countries, the paper confirms the positive impact of the implementation of <b>Business</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>systems</b> on organizations’ effectiveness. Research implications: The paper provides insights that can fuel future in-depth research aimed at the development of objective methods for measuring {{the impact of the}} implementation of <b>Business</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>systems</b> on organizational effectiveness, as well as further quantitative research. Practical implications: Results of the majority of studies indicate that the implementation of <b>Business</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>systems</b> brings tangible benefits to organizations.

Data warehouses serve to combine data from many different operational source systems into one logical data model, which can then be subsequently fed into a <b>business</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>system</b> for reporting and analytics.

50|$|The {{history of}} the Academy tracks closely the {{history of the}} field of {{competitive}} intelligence which has risen in importance during the 1980s with the increase in global competitive pressures and the spread of Internet search engines which made information more accessible. In 1986, the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals (SCIP) was founded in Washington, DC to serve as the professional association for academics, practitioners and consultants in CI. During the next decade, organizations experimented in acquiring and using CI with little discipline and no consistent results. For example, as a survey by the Academy showed, one of CI's main objectives, avoiding strategic surprises, was not being accomplished in many large companies. Three early developers of the Society banded together to create a standard of training and performance in the field. They were: Leonard Fuld, whose book, Competitor Intelligence, was the first best seller on the subject, Ben Gilad, whose book The <b>Business</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>System</b> created the benchmark for setting up a corporate CI function, and Jan Herring who was the founding director of the first competitive intelligence function created in 1982 at Motorola Corp. Together with the growth of SCIP, the creation of the Academy accelerated greatly the formalization and acceptance of CI functions and positions across global companies, with some estimating that 97% of Fortune 500 corporations today have at least one CI analyst in each of their larger business units.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, several {{solutions}} can {{be obtained}} from business intelligence product vendors for building <b>business</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>system.</b> However, based on our experience in implementing <b>business</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>system</b> in telecommunications, many practical challenges and problems are emerging continuously when we use the above products to integrate and mine business intelligence from operational systems and work flows. As a result of survey, 85 % of data warehouse projects failed to meet their intended objectives. One of the key reasons, we believe, is located at the design strategy of system architecture whether it is from systematical viewpoint or not. In this paper, based on our work experience in theory and application, we take the process of constructing a <b>business</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>system</b> as a systematic engineering, and abstracted and advanced a hybrid strategies for constructing software architecture of telecommunications <b>business</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>system,</b> which implements the BI system based on the four types of models step by step, supports system analysis and design from four levels of analyses, a suite of functionalities and components for decision support, and a knowledge portal for integration and presentation of all analysis and design.
