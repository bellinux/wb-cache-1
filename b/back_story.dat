5|$|Claims that Stroheim's {{original}} cut was {{a completely}} unabridged version of McTeague are not accurate. Stroheim's 300-page script was {{almost as long as}} the original novel, but he rethought the entire story and invented new scenes, as well as extensively elaborating existing ones. In the Norris novel, McTeague's <b>back</b> <b>story</b> in Placer County and relationships with his father, mother and Potter were remembered as a flashback and took two paragraphs. In Stroheim's original Greed, this sequence took up the first hour of the film and was not a flashback. Stroheim also modernized the novel's time span to between 1908 and 1923, a quarter-century later than the novel.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this discovery, Kate locks herself in her crime lab and tries {{to come to terms}} with what just happened, while the police struggle in vain to find any sign of Alice's corpse. These scenes are depicted amongst numerous flashback sequences that comprise most of the issue. Throughout them, <b>back</b> <b>story</b> is provided from her childhood that depicts Kate, her twin sister Beth, and their mother being kidnapped. While Kate's father is able to rescue her, it appears as though both her sister and mother have been killed by the time he arrives.|$|E

5|$|Rand and Robyn Miller both {{wanted to}} develop Mysts <b>back</b> <b>story</b> into novels. After {{the success of}} Myst, {{publisher}} Hyperion signed a three-book, US$1 million deal with the brothers. David Wingrove worked from the Miller brothers' story outlines. The three books, entitled Myst: The Book of Atrus, Myst: The Book of Ti'ana, and Myst: The Book of D'ni, were released in 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively.

5|$|Since his cameo appearance, {{director}} Tetsuya Nomura {{has said}} that Roxas is an important character in the series, {{and in order to}} explain his <b>back</b> <b>story</b> in more detail than was done in Kingdom Hearts II, Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days was created.

Various types of merchandise based on his character has been produced.|$|E
5|$|The <b>back</b> <b>story</b> in the {{published}} synopsis {{differs from the}} actual production in a few aspects. When the organ grinder takes the children back to his hovel, the inter-title states {{they are forced to}} dance. In the synopsis, it states the children are instructed to dance to the hurdy-gurdy. The organ grinder does not play a hurdy-gurdy. In {{the published}} synopsis the parents are named Eugenie Freeman and Paul Temple. However, the letter the father receives is addressed to Paul Tilden. The letter informs him of Joseph Tilden's death and of the $100,000 inheritance.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene where}} Candace {{mentions}} that {{her best friend}} Stacy Hirano had become the president of Uruguay was originally written as a throwaway joke for the episode. During an e-mail exchange between the crew, some crew members were curious about the line and Povenmire {{came up with an}} entire <b>back</b> <b>story,</b> in which Stacy meets the prince of the country, moves there and, after changing several laws, becomes eligible for the presidency. The staff enjoyed the idea and wrote it down as a possible plot for a future episode.|$|E
5|$|The Saturn's {{hardware}} {{was new to}} the team, and it {{was their}} first attempt at creating an original environment. It was also Futatsugi's first year working as a full developer at Sega, so he was only able to do simple things while having a clear vision of what he wanted, which helped him to keep the overall style pure, with stark and minimalist cutscenes. Similarly, Iwade kept the enemies easy to understand visually, with simple shapes, and this overall simple style ended up fitting well with the Saturn's hardware. Then, Team Andromeda set to work on elaborating an extensive <b>back</b> <b>story,</b> and Futatsugi, to be original and to avoid using Japanese or English, {{went so far as}} to create a new language for the game: a mix of Ancient Greek, Latin and Russian. This was apparently inspired by the anime The Wings of Honneamise, of which team members were fans and which also features an invented language.|$|E
5|$|The {{main story}} {{consisted}} of 11 parts {{running through the}} Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps books. Expanding upon the overall story are four one-shots labeled Tales of the Sinestro Corps, {{as well as one}} tie-in with Blue Beetle #20. Part One, the one-shot Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1, was released in June 2007. Parts Two through Ten were released between August and December, alternating between Green Lantern #21–25 and Green Lantern Corps #14–18, with an epilogue in Green Lantern #26. The content of Green Lantern Corps #19 was changed to illustrate the battle between Sodam Yat and Superman-Prime in response to the fans' reaction to the story. Geoff Johns announced in October 2007 that the conclusion Green Lantern #25 would be delayed two weeks. After the storyline concluded, Green Lantern/Sinestro Corps Secret Files #1 was released in December. The issue further explored the <b>back</b> <b>story</b> of the opposing groups and listed every member of the Green Lantern Corps and Sinestro Corps.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to the show's debut, creator Dick Wolf remarked, [...] "Conviction {{will be a}} 'charactercedural', we will {{be dealing}} {{extensively}} with characters' <b>back</b> <b>stories</b> and personal lives.

5|$|The {{narrative}} alternates {{between three}} characters (Emiko, Anton and Sophie) and takes place around the fiftieth {{anniversary of the}} atomic bombing of Hiroshima, though the <b>back</b> <b>story</b> of each character is told. Emiko was a small girl living in Hiroshima with her parents, younger brother, and grandfather during World War II. Following the atomic bombing, with her parents dead, Emiko and her brother recover in a hospital and her grandfather cares for patients. Though her brother dies, Emiko travels to the United States {{as part of a}} group of girls receiving reconstructive surgery. On the way, the American media takes an interest in the girls and she appears on an episode of This Is Your Life thanking the American audience for bringing her to the US. She later becomes a documentary filmmaker and, in 1995, approaches Anton Böll to be part of a new project.|$|E
5|$|Writing the {{screenplay}} took about six months. During this period, Gidding worked alone, {{and although he}} passed some of his work to Wise to show him that work on {{the screenplay}} was progressing well, he and Wise did not otherwise collaborate on the screenplay. The screenplay made other changes to the story. The number of characters was cut down, the <b>back</b> <b>story</b> was significantly shortened, most of the supernatural events depicted in the novel were kept off-screen, and {{the greater part of}} the action was set inside the house to heighten the audience's feeling of claustrophobia. Eleanor's role as an outcast was also emphasized. The character of Theodora was given a sharper, slightly more cruel sense of humor in order to make her a foil for Eleanor but also to heighten Eleanor's outsider status. The role of Luke was made more flippant, and Dr. Markway (Montague in the novel) was made a more confident character. The screenplay was finished just after Wise completed work on West Side Story.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the goals}} of the team for Angel of Darkness were to create more {{complicated}} puzzles and make the character of Lara Croft, together with the tone of the game, darker and more hard-edged. They also wished to compete with some of the newer action-adventure games on the market, which were providing heavy competition, and include gameplay ideas from Shenmue and the Metal Gear series. Many character movements were drawn from and based directly on movements made by real people, similar to later motion capture techniques, and the world design drew from various artists and elements of films from the likes of Luc Besson and David Fincher. Murti Schofield, who had previously worked with Core Design, was brought in to write the story and script. As part of writing the background for the organisations involved in the story, he researched historical secret societies and artefacts, and accurate translations of Latin text incorporated into the game. Schofield created the character Kurtis Trent upon a request for someone who could become the focus of a spin-off franchise. Core spent two years trying to reshape the franchise as well as writing a <b>back</b> <b>story</b> {{in the form of a}} book separated into multiple chapters, with Angel of Darkness being the first of those chapters.|$|E
50|$|The film {{opens with}} Ved (Ranbir Kapoor) and Tara's (Deepika Padukone) {{monotonous}} <b>back</b> <b>stories</b> {{as people in}} the corporate world.

50|$|The {{exposition}} is {{the portion}} of a story that introduces important background information to the audience; for example, information about the setting, events occurring before the main plot, characters' <b>back</b> <b>stories,</b> etc. Exposition can be conveyed through dialogues, flashbacks, characters' thoughts, background details, in-universe media, or the narrator telling a back-story.|$|R
50|$|The Battle Action Force <b>back</b> <b>stories</b> that {{accompanied}} {{the release of the}} figures (see Battle Action Force tie in), were less extensive than were the case for the SAS Force and Z Force ranges - the SAS Force for example featured in nearly twenty separate storylines, Q Force in contrast had seven.|$|R
5|$|The first Halloween comic was {{published}} by Brian Pulido's Chaos! Comics. Simply titled Halloween, {{it was intended to}} be a one-issue special, but eventually two sequels spawned: Halloween II: The Blackest Eyes and Halloween III: The Devil's Eyes. All of the stories were written by Phil Nutman, with Daniel Farrands—writer for Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers—assisting on the first issue; David Brewer and Justiniano worked on the illustrations. Tommy Doyle is the main protagonist in each of the issues, focusing on his attempts to kill Michael Myers. The first issue includes <b>back</b> <b>story</b> on Michael's childhood, while the third picks up after the events of the film Halloween H20. These comics were based on Daniel Farrand's concept for Halloween: Resurrection; he had been approached by the producers to pitch a follow-up to Halloween H20. His idea was to have Tommy Doyle incarcerated at Smith's Grove for Michael Myers' crimes, only to escape and reunite with Lindsay Wallace. Together, they study the journals of Dr. Loomis and find out more about Michael's childhood. The movie would have explored Michael's time at Smith's Grove and relationship with Dr. Loomis, before returning to Tommy and Lindsay, who are attacked by the adult Michael Myers. Upon defeating him and removing his mask, they discover Laurie Strode, who has taken over her brother's mantle. Farrand's logic was that, since Jamie Lee Curtis was contracted to cameo in Halloween: Resurrection, they should make that cameo as significant and surprising as possible. Although the studio did not follow up on his pitch, Farrands was able to tell his story in comic book form.|$|E
5|$|For their novel, {{the group}} members {{decide to take}} the typical {{elements}} from already popular young-adult series. Homer initially suggest that they write about vampires, but Patty notes {{the fact that there}} are already so many popular novels out there in that genre. They therefore decide to write about an orphan troll who goes to a magic school located under the Brooklyn Bridge. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team talking and offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they are writing. The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although he likes the novel, he dismisses it because it lacks a fake author with an inspirational <b>back</b> <b>story.</b> Meanwhile, Lisa is having a hard time making progress on her book because of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have her name on a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy. Lisa admits defeat and takes the offer. They and the rest of the crew then approach the book publishing executive again, and he decides to buy the novel for a million dollars. As the team is celebrating at Moe's Tavern, they receive an advance copy. They are shocked to discover that the publisher has replaced the troll-aspects of the story with vampires, renaming the novel The Vampire Twins of Transylvania Prep, because market testing showed that vampires are more popular than trolls.|$|E
