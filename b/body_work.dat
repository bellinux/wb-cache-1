25|$|Body psychotherapy, part of {{the field}} of somatic psychology, focuses on the link between the mind and the body and tries to access deeper levels of the psyche through greater {{awareness}} of the physical body and emotions. There are various body-oriented approaches, such as Reichian (Wilhelm Reich) character-analytic vegetotherapy and orgonomy; neo-Reichian bioenergetic analysis; somatic experiencing; integrative body psychotherapy; Ron Kurtz's Hakomi psychotherapy; sensorimotor psychotherapy; Biosynthesis psychotherapy; and Biodynamic psychotherapy. These approaches are {{not to be confused with}} <b>body</b> <b>work</b> or body-therapies that seek to improve primarily physical health through direct work (touch and manipulation) on the body, rather than through directly psychological methods.|$|E
25|$|A search {{concluded}} that there was no T. Keane missing in any English-speaking country and a nationwide circulation of the dry-cleaning marks also proved fruitless. In fact, all that could be garnered from the suitcase was that since a coat in the suitcase had a front gusset and featherstitching, it could have been made only in the United States, as this was the only country that possessed the machinery for that stitch. Although mass-produced, the <b>body</b> <b>work</b> is done when the owner is fitted before it is completed.

25|$|The Zonda R Evolución is {{an updated}} version of the Zonda R. It {{features}} many changes over the previous Zonda R. Also the car takes many pieces and inspirations from the Zonda 760RS. It is finished in pearl white with exposed carbon-fibre on the nose. The 6.0L V12 engine is uprated to 800PS. The <b>body</b> <b>work</b> is still the same, but has improved aerodynamics. It features a bigger air splitter above the two standard air splitters on the front bumper and a pair of small splitters {{on the sides of the}} rear bumper. A bigger rear central fin— even bigger than the 760 series Zondas— and a small spoiler added below the standard Zonda R spoiler improves aerodynamics and increases down-force.|$|E
25|$|Work can be {{extracted}} also from bodies colder than the surroundings. When {{the flow of}} energy is coming into the <b>body,</b> <b>work</b> is performed by this energy obtained from the large reservoir, the surrounding. A quantitative treatment {{of the notion of}} energy quality rests on the definition of energy. According to the standard definition, Energy {{is a measure of the}} ability to do work. Work can involve the movement of a mass by a force that results from a transformation of energy. If there is an energy transformation, the second principle of energy flow transformations says that this process must involve the dissipation of some energy as heat. Measuring the amount of heat released is one way of quantifying the energy, or ability to do work and apply a force over a distance.|$|E
25|$|According to Admiral Robin Dhowan, about 83% of the {{fabrication}} work and 75% {{of the construction}} work had been completed {{at the time of}} launching. He said that 90% of the <b>body</b> <b>work</b> of the aircraft carrier had been designed and made in India, about 50% of the propulsion system, and about 30% of its weaponry. He also said that the ship would be equipped with a long range missile system with multi-function radar and a close-in weapon system (CIWS). After the launch, Vikrant was re-docked for the second phase of construction, in which the ship will be fitted with various weapons and sensors, and the propulsion system, flight deck and the aircraft complex will be integrated. In December 2014 it was reported that Vikrant will be commissioned by 2018.|$|E

500|$|To {{encourage}} exploration, the Magnum Opus can be upgraded {{with materials}} scavenged from the desert, by hijacking enemies' cars or collecting their car parts. An enemy can jump {{on top of}} the Magnum Opus to make it explode, but the player can avoid that by surrounding the car with hazards such as spikes. The player can access the garage screen throughout the game, allowing them to customize the Magnum Opus. Max's garage can change and modify the car's engine, chassis, wheels, <b>body</b> <b>work,</b> paint job, and its [...] "shell". Upgrading one aspect of the car will negatively affect other aspects; upgrading the engine will allow Max to drive faster, but handling will be more difficult. The sound produced by the engine changes when players change, add, or remove parts of the Magnum Opus. Max, his armor, and weapons are customizable; the player can unlock new skills and upgrades for him as he progresses through the game and earns experience points. Max is also customizable, with his clothing, appearance, fighting skills, and weapons being modifiable. Griffa, a wasteland wanderer, also offers Max tokens which can be used to upgrade his abilities.|$|E

For 1989, the 3.1L was only mated to a four-speed automatic transmission, while the remaining 2.8 was mated to either manual or automatic transmissions.
