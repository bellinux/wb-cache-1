40|$|Various 4 -acyl- 3 -[22 ̆ 7 -(carboalkoxy) phenyl]sydnones were {{synthesized}} by {{reaction of}} the parent sydnone with the corresponding anhydrides and Montmorillonite K- 10. In the Q-tube, the acylation using acetic anhydride, which normally took 1. 5 days for complete conversion thermally, was complete in 8. 5 hours. Use of bismuth triflate as catalyst reduced the reaction time to 5 hours and, in the microwave, reactions were complete in 30 minutes and provided comparable yields. New sydnones were synthesized with acetic, propionic, <b>butyric,</b> and isobutyric <b>anhydrides.</b> Extension to various homogeneous metal triflates (lanthanum, yttrium, scandium, hafnium, gadolinium, and indium) was explored. Reactions were performed with 3 -phenylsydnone as reactant, initially under thermal conditions overnight, individually with the six chosen catalysts.

The results showed the positive effects of reaction duration and total anhydride dosage on WPG and the negative effects of reaction temperature and molar ratio of AA/BA on WPG. The feeding method of acetylation after butyrylation resulted in the increased WPG compared with acetylation before butyrylation. FT-IR and 1 H– 13 C correlation 2 D NMR (HSQC) studies provided evidence for acylation. The bagasse acetate butyrates showed increased thermal stability after acylation.

40|$|The {{ionic liquid}} (IL), 1 -allyl- 3 -(1 -butyl) imidazolium {{chloride}} (AlBuImCl), has been synthesized and its properties determined.

40|$|This {{article is}} under embargo until July 9, 2017, per {{publisher}} policy. In {{order to improve}} the compatibility between lignin fillers and polyurethane matrix, two different chemical strategies were used to modify the lignin macromolecules. Modified lignin was incorporated into vegetable oil-based polyurethanes to produce composites with high bio-content. Lignin modified with octadecyl isocyanante (lignin urethane) {{was found to be}} more compatible with the polyurethane matrix than lignin modified with <b>butyric</b> <b>anhydride.</b> The effect of lignin urethane loading on the thermo-mechanical properties, thermal resistance, and dielectric properties were investigated. High lignin content (up to 30 wt. %) increased the Young's modulus and lowered the onset of thermal degradation. Incorporation of lignin urethane did not change the glass transition temperature of the polyurethane composites significantly, but it increased the dielectric constant compared to neat polyurethane.

40|$|Abstract: Whole unfractionated heparin can {{modestly}} decrease tumor growth, but {{the dose}} of heparin {{is limited by}} its an-ticoagulant properties. To overcome this limitation, we modified the chemical structure of heparin and have prepared a heparin derivative by O-acylating low molecular weight heparin with <b>butyric</b> <b>anhydride,</b> producing a more potent antipro-liferative compound, which is only weakly anticoagulant so that the dose may be escalated without threat of hemorrhage. In this study, we investigated {{the effect of this}} chemically modified heparin, butanoylated heparin, on the growth of lung cancer in vitro and in vivo. We found that butanoylated heparin a) significantly inhibited lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro and lung cancer growth in mice and rats; b) had very low anticoagulant effect; c) had no significant toxicity on heart, liver, kidney and lung; d) significantly although modestly induced apoptosis and decreased expression of the cell prolif-eration pathway consisting of mutant p 53, phospho-Rb and E 2 F 1 expression in the tumor tissues. We also found that bu-tanoylated heparin significantly inhibited CXCL 12 and CXCR 4 expression, suggesting that CXCL 12 /CXCR 4 axis may be involved in regulation of tumor growth inhibition by heparin. We concluded that chemically modified butanoylated hepa-rin has potent antiproliferative activity against lung cancer and may represent a new chemical therapeutic agent for cancer patients...|$|E
