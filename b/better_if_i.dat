500|$|Diaby {{is often}} {{described}} as a typical box-to-box midfielder; a midfielder who is adept both offensively and defensively. While he can play as a defensive midfielder, Diaby has often attempted to distance himself from that position, admitting that [...] "I am <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have a holding midfielder with me". His club manager Arsène Wenger describes him similarly stating [...] "He (Diaby) is more of an offensive player. He is not a defensive-minded player and he's not a holding player. He's a player who crosses the field at ease, goes from box to box like it's no distance and has good power as well". During his early years with Auxerre, he was often used as an attacking midfielder or a support striker due to his technical ability, close control, and dexterity to dribble past opponents or slip passes to teammates.|$|E
500|$|Charles Aaron from Spin {{described}} the song as [...] "slinking through [...] low-ridin', gum-smackin' groove, Maddy's hard-bitten ingenue expresses no regrets, {{but this time}} you feel for her." [...] Aaron highlighted the lyrics [...] "Would it sound <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were a man?" [...] as subversive and coy. Author Lucy O'Brien described in her book, , that [...] "Human Nature" [...] {{was one of the}} [...] "quirkiest" [...] tracks on Bedtime Stories, [...] "throbbing with a tightly restrained but devastating anger". For Barry Walters from Moscow-Pullman Daily News, the song had the catchiest chorus among all the other tracks from the album. Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly gave the song a negative review, noting that Madonna's [...] "on far surer ground thrashing through such neurotic (if not uncommon) views of relationships than she is trashing the media. In striking back at her critics, Madonna simply sounds self-righteous and smug. 'I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex,' she sneers in 'Human Nature'. 'Did I say something true?' Yes. But tooting your own horn about it just sounds petty". Rooksby said that the repetition of the sample was [...] "wearing" [...] and it [...] "did not suggest that the world of the singer was very appealing".|$|E
2500|$|Tilley {{was born}} in Commandery Street, Worcester, Worcestershire in 1864. Her father, known as Harry Ball, was a comedy actor, {{songwriter}} and music hall chairman; with his encouragement, Tilley first appeared on stage {{at the age of}} three and a half. At the age of six she did her first role in male clothing, billed as [...] "The Pocket Sims Reeves", a reference to the then-famous opera singer. She also performed songs from his repertoire, to add to the illusion. She would come to prefer doing male roles exclusively, saying that [...] "I felt that I could express myself <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were dressed as a boy." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early 201, after Cao Cao {{defeated}} his northern rival Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, he sent Zhang Liao {{to pacify}} the various counties in Lu State, and then ordered him and Xiahou Yuan to lead an army {{to attack a}} minor warlord Chang Xi (昌豨) in Donghai Commandery (東海郡; around present-day Linyi, Shandong). Zhang Liao and Xiahou Yuan had besieged Chang Xi for months but were unable to defeat him and their supplies were running out, so they considered retreating. Zhang Liao told Xiahou Yuan, [...] "Over the past several days, whenever we attacked Chang Xi, I noticed he paid careful attention to me. He's also running short of arrows. I suspect he's having doubts, therefore he isn't {{doing his best to}} resist us. Wouldn't it be <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> manage to persuade him to surrender?" [...] He then sent a message to Chang Xi and asked to speak to him. When Zhang Liao met Chang Xi, he told the latter that Cao Cao rewarded those who submitted to him. Convinced by Zhang Liao, Chang Xi agreed to surrender to Cao Cao. Zhang Liao then went to Chang Xi's home alone and visited his family. Chang Xi was delighted and he followed Zhang Liao and Xiahou Yuan back to meet Cao Cao.|$|E
2500|$|From 1953 to 1955 {{he went to}} sea as Commander Cruisers-Destroyers, Pacific, {{where his}} career was stalled {{temporarily}} by Secretary of the Navy Charles S. Thomas. Chief of Naval Operations Robert B. Carney was selecting members of an upcoming promotion board and picked Curts for his skill and contacts {{in the fields of}} electronics and communications. However, [...] "Mr. Thomas vetoed [...] when I brought the slate in, and said that he didn't want him around Washington. I couldn't get from him any expression of reason as to this prejudice, but it was perfectly obvious that I couldn't bring [...] back. It was also perfectly obvious that I'd better not nominate him for three stars, which I had planned to do...But about a year later, I was looking for a replacement in the Second Fleet, and I brought in a nomination. Thomas said that he wasn't particularly impressed with the person I was suggesting and said {{it seemed to him that}} I'd do <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> put someone like [...] in." [...] Queried as to his change of heart, Thomas initially denied ever having vetoed Curts, then, when pressed by an incredulous Carney, [...] "finally said he couldn't understand why he had done it, except that somebody must have told him something." [...] Carney immediately nominated Curts for his third star.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, after a {{visit to}} a United Methodist Church in Highland Park, Texas, Keillor created a local {{controversy}} with his remarks about the event, including the rhetorical suggestion of a connection between event participants and supporters of torture and a statement creating an impression of political intimidation: [...] "I walked in, was met by two burly security men ... and within 10 minutes was told by three people that this was the Bushes' church {{and that it would be}} <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't talk about politics." [...] In response, the lecture series coordinator said the two “burly security men” were a local policeman and the church’s own security supervisor, both present because the agreement with Keillor‘s publisher specified that the venue provide security. In addition the coordinator said Mr. Keillor arrived at the church, declined an introduction and took the stage without an opportunity to mingle with the audience, and so did not know when these warnings might have been dispensed. The publicist concurred, saying that Keillor did not have contact with any church members or people in the audience before he spoke. Supposedly, before Keillor's remarks, participants in the event had considered the visit to have been cordial and warm. Asked to respond, Keillor stuck to his story, describing the people who advised him not to discuss politics and saying that he did not have security guards at other stops on the tour.|$|E
