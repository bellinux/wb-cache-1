The surplus banks will want to earn a higher rate than the support rate that the central bank pays on reserves; whereas the deficit banks will want to pay a lower interest rate than the discount rate the central bank charges for borrowing. Thus they will lend to each other until each bank has reached their reserve requirement.

Dudley Althaus of the Houston Chronicle stated that Grillo [...] "traces the beast's footprints with meticulous research" [...] and with [...] "courageous reporting on some of [...] meanest streets".

60|$|Such {{it seems}} to me are the chief masses of the complex of motives in us, the group of sense, the group of pride, curiosity and the {{imitative}} and suggested motives, making up the system of impulses which is our will. Such has been the common outfit of motives in every age, and in every age its melee has been found insufficient in itself. It is a heterogeneous system, it does not form in any sense a completed or <b>balanced</b> <b>system,</b> its constituents are variable and compete amongst themselves. They are not so much arranged about one another as superposed and higgledy-piggledy. The senses and curiosity war with pride and one another, the motives suggested to us fall into conflict with this element or that of our intimate and habitual selves. We find all our instincts are snares to excess. Excesses of indulgence lead to excesses of abstinence, and even the sense of beauty may be clouded and betray. So to us all, even for the most balanced of us, come disappointments, regrets, gaps; and for most of us who are ill-balanced, miseries and despairs. Nearly all of us want something to hold us together--something to dominate this swarming confusion and save us from the black misery of wounded and exploded pride, of thwarted desire, of futile conclusions. We want more oneness, some steadying thing that will afford an escape from fluctuations.|$|E
60|$|The States of Europe, {{excepting}} Russia, {{were already}} a settled, established and <b>balanced</b> <b>system.</b> They {{were living in}} final and conclusive boundaries with no further possibility of peaceful expansion. Every extension of a European state involved a war; it was only possible through war. And while the limits to the United States have been set by the steamship and the railroad, the limits to the European sovereign states were drawn at a much earlier time. They were drawn by the horse, and particularly the coach-horse travelling along the high road. If you will examine a series of political maps of Europe {{for the last two}} thousand years, you will see that there has evidently been a definite limit to the size of sovereign states through all that time, due to the impossibility of keeping them together because of the difficulty of intercommunication if they grew bigger. And this was {{in spite of the fact}} that there were two great unifying ideas present in men's minds in Europe throughout that period, namely, the unifying idea of the Roman Empire, and the unifying idea of Christendom. Both these ideas tended to make Europe one, but the difficulties of communication defeated that tendency. It is quite interesting to watch the adventures of what is called first the Roman Empire and afterwards the Holy Roman Empire, in a series of historical maps. It keeps expanding and then dropping to pieces again. It is like the efforts of someone who is trying to pack up a parcel which is much too big, in wet blotting paper. The cohesion was inadequate. And so it was that the eighteenth century found Europe still divided up into what I may perhaps call these high-road and coach-horse states, each with a highly developed foreign policy, each with an intense sense of national difference and each with intense traditional antagonisms.|$|E

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that complex <b>balanced</b> mass-action <b>systems</b> exhibit a {{restrictive}} form of behaviour known as locally stable dynamics. This means that within each compatibility class C_x_ 0 [...] -the forward invariant space where solutions lies [...] -there is exactly one equilibrium concentration and that this concentration is locally asymptotically stable. It has also been conjectured that this stability extends globally to C_x_ 0. That is to say, all solutions originating in C_x_ 0 approach the unique positive equilibrium concentration rather than ∂C_x_ 0 or ∞. To date, however, no general proof of this conjecture has been found.
