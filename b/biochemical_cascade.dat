500|$|After {{five years}} of collaboration, Collier {{arranged}} for Piper to work with pharmacologist John Vane at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, {{in order to learn}} Vane's new bioassay methods, which seemed like a possible solution to the in vitro testing failures. Vane and Piper tested the <b>biochemical</b> <b>cascade</b> associated with anaphylactic shock (in extracts from guinea pig lungs, applied to tissue from rabbit aortas). They found that aspirin inhibited the release of an unidentified chemical generated by guinea pig lungs, a chemical that caused rabbit tissue to contract. By 1971, Vane identified the chemical (which they called [...] "rabbit-aorta contracting substance," [...] or RCS) as a prostaglandin. In a 23 June 1971 paper in the journal Nature, Vane and Piper suggested that aspirin and similar drugs (the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs) worked by blocking the production of prostaglandins. Later research showed that NSAIDs such as aspirin worked by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, the enzyme responsible for converting arachidonic acid into a prostaglandin.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe modulatory neurotransmitters {{that trigger}} <b>biochemical</b> <b>cascades</b> {{underlying}} olfactory learning in Drosophila mushroom bodies have remained unknown. To identify molecules that may perform this role, putative biogenic amine receptors were cloned using the {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. One new receptor, DAMB, {{was identified as a}} dopamine D 1 receptor by sequence analysis and pharmacological characterization. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses revealed highly enriched expression of DAMB in mushroom bodies, in a pattern coincident with the rutabaga-encoded adenylyl cyclase. The spatial coexpression of DAMB and the cyclase, along with DAMB's capacity to mediate dopamine-induced increases in cAMP make this receptor an attractive candidate for initiating <b>biochemical</b> <b>cascades</b> underlying learning...|$|R
50|$|Without the {{activity}} of glutamate transporters, glutamate would build up and kill cells in a process called excitotoxicity, in which excessive amounts of glutamate acts as a toxin to neurons by triggering a number of <b>biochemical</b> <b>cascades.</b> The activity of glutamate transporters also allows glutamate to be recycled for repeated release.|$|R
50|$|<b>Biochemical</b> <b>cascades</b> {{exist in}} biology, {{where a small}} {{reaction}} can have system-wide implications.

2500|$|Invertebrates do {{not possess}} {{lymphocytes}} or an antibody-based humoral immune system, {{and it is likely}} that a multicomponent, adaptive immune system arose with the first vertebrates. [...] Nevertheless, invertebrates possess mechanisms that appear to be precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity. Pattern recognition receptors are proteins used by nearly all organisms to identify molecules associated with microbial pathogens. Toll-like receptors are a major class of pattern recognition receptor, that exists in all coelomates (animals with a body-cavity), including humans. The complement system, as discussed above, is a <b>biochemical</b> <b>cascade</b> of the immune system that helps clear pathogens from an organism, and exists in most forms of life. Some invertebrates, including various insects, crabs, and worms utilize a modified form of the complement response known as the prophenoloxidase (proPO) system.|$|E

40|$|Protein–protein binding and {{signaling}} pathways {{are important}} fields of biomedical science. Here we report simple optical methods for {{the determination of}} the equilibrium binding constant Kd of protein–protein interactions as well as quantitative studies of <b>biochemical</b> <b>cascades.</b> The techniques are based on steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between ECFP and Venus-YFP fused to proteins of the SUMO family. Using FRET has several advantages over conventional free-solution techniques such as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) : Concentrations are determined accurately by absorbance, highly sensitive binding signals enable the analysis of small quantities, and assays are compatible with multi-well plate format. Most importantly, our FRET-based techniques enable us to measure the effect of other molecules on the binding of two proteins of interest, which is not straightforward with other approaches.

2500|$|This {{pathologic}} phenomenon {{can also}} occur after brain injury and spinal cord injury. Within minutes after spinal cord injury, damaged neural cells within the lesion site spill glutamate into the extracellular space where glutamate can stimulate presynaptic glutamate receptors {{to enhance the}} release of additional glutamate. Brain trauma or stroke can cause [...] ischemia, in which blood flow is reduced to inadequate levels. Ischemia is followed by accumulation of glutamate and aspartate in the extracellular fluid, causing cell death, which is aggravated by lack of oxygen and glucose. The <b>biochemical</b> <b>cascade</b> resulting from ischemia and involving excitotoxicity is called the ischemic cascade. [...] Because of the events resulting from ischemia and glutamate receptor activation, a deep chemical coma may be induced in patients with brain injury to reduce the metabolic rate of the brain (its need for oxygen and glucose) and save energy {{to be used to}} remove glutamate actively. (The main aim in induced comas is to reduce the intracranial pressure, not brain metabolism).|$|E

500|$|Spinal {{cord injury}} can be {{traumatic}} or nontraumatic, {{and can be}} classified into three types based on cause: mechanical forces, toxic, and ischemic (from lack of blood flow). [...] The damage can also be divided into primary and secondary injury: the cell death that occurs immediately in the original injury, and <b>biochemical</b> <b>cascades</b> that are initiated by the original insult and cause further tissue damage. [...] These secondary injury pathways include the ischemic cascade, inflammation, swelling, cell suicide, and neurotransmitter imbalances. [...] They can take place for minutes or weeks following the injury.|$|R
2500|$|DAI is {{characterized}} by axonal separation, in which the axon is torn {{at the site of}} stretch and the part distal to the tear degrades. [...] While it was once thought that the main cause of axonal separation was tearing due to mechanical forces during the trauma, it is now understood that axons are not typically torn upon impact; rather, secondary <b>biochemical</b> <b>cascades,</b> which occur in response to the primary injury (which occurs as the result of mechanical forces at the moment of trauma) and take place hours to days after the initial injury, are largely responsible for the damage to axons.|$|R

5|$|A large {{percentage}} of the people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather days to weeks after the event; rather than improving after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (the damage that occurs at the moment of trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; rather, it is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and <b>biochemical</b> <b>cascades</b> that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma.

40|$|AbstractTo {{systematically}} {{understand the}} molecular events that underlie biological phenomena, we must develop methods to integrate {{an enormous amount}} of genomic and proteomic data. The integration of molecular data should go beyond the construction of <b>biochemical</b> <b>cascades</b> among molecules to include tying the biochemical phenomena to physical events. For the behavior and guidance of growth cones, it remains largely unclear how biochemical events in the cytoplasm are linked to the morphological changes of the growth cone. We take a computational approach to simulate the <b>biochemical</b> signaling <b>cascade</b> involving members of the Rho family of GTPases and examine their potential roles in growth-cone motility and axon guidance. Based on the interactions between Cdc 42, Rac, and RhoA, we show that the activation of a Cdc 42 -specific GEF resulted in switching responses between oscillatory and convergent activities for all three GTPases. We propose that the switching responses of these GTPases are the molecular basis for the decision mechanism that determines the direction of the growth-cone expansion, providing a spatiotemporal integration mechanism that allows the growth cone to detect small gradients of external guidance cues. These results suggest a potential role for the cross talk between Rho GTPases in governing growth-cone movement and axon guidance and underscore the link between chemodynamic reactions and cellular behaviors...|$|R
