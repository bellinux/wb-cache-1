40|$|ABSTRACT This {{dissertation}} {{was carried}} out to study the impact of uncertainty factors on Earned Value Management (EVM). There are many uncertainty factors associated with Earned Value Analysis (EVA), {{one of the main}} factors being predicting the Budget for each month. The primary objective of this dissertation was to study the impact of uncertainty on EVA by carrying out EVA without using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) and by carrying out EVA using MCS. The results obtained from both the analysis are compared and checked if MCS helps to reduce the uncertainty associated with EVA. The result of this research pointed out that MCS does reduce the uncertainty associated with EVA by adjusting the values of <b>Budget</b> <b>at</b> <b>completion</b> (BAC). Crystal Ball software was used to perform MCS in order to obtain the mean value used to carry out EVA. Comparisons made thus show that the uncertainty associated with BAC are reduced after every month as the project progresses by taking into account the Actual Cost spent after each month...|$|E
40|$|Forecasting {{the final}} cost with Earned Value Management (EVM) and {{managing}} contingency budgets during the project execution have been traditionally considered as two separate streams of project management research. In {{an attempt to}} combine the two areas {{for the purpose of}} reflecting the risk impact on the cost forecast, this paper presents a cost estimate at completion (CEAC) methodology adjusted with risk contingency. The proposed method is a refined Earned Schedule (ES) based nonlinear CEAC model modified with a new parameter representing the S-shaped contingency consumption as a portion of the project <b>budget</b> <b>at</b> <b>completion.</b> The model is validated on eight construction projects and its estimates' accuracy and stability with a varying contingency parameter value in the early, middle, and late stages are evaluated. The cost-schedule-risk relationship represented in the model is a contribution to creating a stronger connection between EVM and contingency cost management theories through capturing the interconnected dynamics between a cost baseline and contingency accounts of ongoing projects. As a practical implication, the model is a tool for integrating the contingency consumption into nonlinear CEAC models for accurate and stable cost forecasting especially during the early and middle stages of project executio...|$|E
50|$|The total {{approved}} {{budget of the}} project was $1.896 billion and it was delivered on time and in excess of an estimated $60 million under this <b>budget</b> <b>at</b> the <b>completion</b> of construction. The final cost of the plant, before it was refinanced by the NSW Government to the private sector, was $1.803 billion. The plant was refinanced with a book value in excess of $2 billion in early 2012, providing a profit to the government at transaction close.|$|R
50|$|The {{plot was}} {{something}} new for Universal Pictures, which had to approve a story {{that did not have}} a neatly resolved ending. Matheson's novel ends with the character shrinking to infinitesimal size. There is no last-minute rescue; the man keeps shrinking. In spite of these problems, Zugsmith managed to secure a $750,000 <b>budget.</b> <b>At</b> the <b>completion</b> of production, studio executives wanted to change the ending to a happy one with doctors discovering a serum to reverse the shrinking process; director Arnold refused. With the successful Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954) and its sequels to his credit, he was able to convince the studio to agree to a preview. The test audience was startled at the film, but they liked it; the ending was not changed.|$|R

5000|$|The {{reason to}} {{calculate}} PTA {{is that when}} executing the contract, actual cost is the only finance measurement. Compare this measurement with the cost base line to calculate Cost Performance Index (CPI), then we can estimate (forecast) the cost <b>at</b> <b>Completion</b> ('EAC' - Estimate <b>at</b> <b>Completion</b> - according to PMBOK, or 'FAC' - Forecast <b>at</b> <b>Completion</b> - in Ms Project). If EAC exceeds PTA, the buyer is expected to pay the ceiling price, and any more overruns beyond PTA will cause a dollar for dollar decrease in profit for the seller. The profit decrease rate become higher, and once actual cost exceeds ceiling price the seller will start losing money(and then might stop working for the contract).|$|R
