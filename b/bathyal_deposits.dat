40|$|The species studied {{differs from}} the other Hyalopomatus species by having a {{peculiar}} rugose sculptured outer tube surface. This character is markedly variable; it can {{be more or less}} developed and may also vary along the same tube. Observed by SEM, this rugosity proves to consist of irregular flaps, roughly following the growth lines. SEM observations on transverse fractures show a homogeneous composition of the tube wall, consisting of calcium carbonate crystals. These crystals show a prismatic habitus and are arranged in a homogeneous granular microcrystalline structure. New records of H. variorugosus are from deep water stations in the Western Mediterranean and from Pleistocene <b>bathyal</b> <b>deposits</b> of Southern Italy. The discussion covers aspects of tube characters of use for taxonomy.    </p...|$|E
40|$|Middle Eocene foraminiferal assemblages {{have been}} {{analyzed}} from three representative sections of <b>bathyal</b> <b>deposits</b> cropping {{out along the}} Brodina Valley and Voroneţ Valley {{in the northern part}} of the Tarcău Nappe (Eastern Carpathians, Romania). The foraminiferal assemblages are dominated by agglutinated species with tubular forms (Psammosiphonella cylindrica, Nothia spp., Bathysiphon sp.), globular (Saccammina spp., Psammosphaera spp.), coiled (Recurvoides spp., Reticulophragmium spp.) and flattened streptospiral (Paratrochamminoides spp., Trochamminoides spp.). Coarsely agglutinated taxa are characteristic for the “flysch – type” agglutinated foraminiferal biofacies. The depositional setting was probably upper to middle bathyal, as suggested by the abundance of the tubular forms. The morphogroup analyses showed variations in tubular and infaunal morphotypes, suggesting fluctuations in the organic matter input, oxygenation, and disturbing bottom water currents. Based on the presence of Ammodiscus latus, Reticulophragmium amplectens, Haplophragmoides parvulus, Spirosigmoilinela compressa, Psamminopelta gradsteini and the high abundances of Reophax pilulifer, the studied deposits can be assigned to the upper part of the middle Eocene. ...|$|E
30|$|Seismic horizon O/M was {{interpreted}} as a drowning unconformity in previous work (Aubert and Droxler 1992, 1996), based on industrial seismic lines displaying a reflection which could be traced regionally. Wells ARI- 1 (Inner Sea) and NMA- 1 (North Malé Atoll) recorded a change from neritic to upper <b>bathyal</b> <b>deposits</b> above the level of this horizon (Aubert and Droxler 1996; Purdy and Betram 1993; Belopolsky and Droxler 2004 a, 2004 b). This regional deepening event compares well to the fining-upward trend registered in the succession recovered at Site U 1468, where neritic limestones are overlain by wackestones and floatstones with large benthic foraminifers, and finally followed by mudstones and wackestones with planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannoplankton (Fig.  4). This lithological succession, however, indicates a gradual deepening sequence, which culminated with the deposition of pelagic limestone. This {{is in contrast to}} the reported sedimentary evolution in well ARI- 1, where the Paleogene–Neogene transition appears to correspond to an abrupt shift from shallow inner neritic conditions to deeper, outer neritic-upper bathyal conditions (Aubert and Droxler 1996). In any case, the new data from Site U 1468, which is located 115  km north of well ARI- 1 and 79  km northwest of well NMA- 1, provide additional proof that large parts of the Maldives area underwent a substantial deepening during the time interval between 22 and 24  Ma.|$|E
40|$|A nearly {{complete}} articulated head (including pectoral and pelvic girdles and fins) was collected from an Early Pleistocene, upper <b>bathyal,</b> volcanic ash <b>deposit</b> on Tambac Island, Northwest Central Luzon, Philippines. The specimen was positively identified {{because of its}} general resemblance to other large marlins and by its rigid pectoral fin, a characteristic feature of the black marlin. This is the first fossil billfish described from Asia and the first living species of billfish positively identified in the fossil record. The geographic distribution of the two living species of Makaira is discussed, Except for fossil localities bordering the Mediterranean Sea, the distribution offossil post-Oligocene istiophorids roughly corresponds to the distribution of living adult forms...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper {{integrated}} stratigraphy and structural analyses are aimed at the description of a synsedimentary transpressional tectonic event, driving the onset {{and development of the}} Early Pliocene Lascari Basin, located NW of the Madonie Mountains(northern Sicily). Our data show that the transpressive tectonics generated a morphostructural high flanked by a deep and narrow tectonic depression, bounded by steep and tectonically controlled slopes. Within this depression an Early Pliocene fining and deepening upward sedimentary succession was deposited, unconformably overlying the already deformed substrate. The succession is made up of «base-ofslope» breccias, cross-stratified calcarenites, and <b>bathyal</b> limestones <b>deposited</b> in a high-energy palaeostrait setting. The growth geometry that characterizes the stratal pattern of the deposits suggests the activity of a synsedrimentary transpressional event during the Early Pliocene time. The roughly E-W trending Lascari Syncline, where the Early Pliocene syntectonic basin is hosted, belongs to a system of north verging folds, deforming the pre-existing, originally flat thrusts, generated in Langhian-Serravallian time. This paper presents an original interpretation of the stratigraphic and structural evolution of the study sector of the Sicily Fold and Thrust Belt. Our data contribute also to both define the structural style and constrain the timing of transpressional tectonic event in northern Sicily. A brief comparison performed between the data here presented and those coming from adjacent sectors of northern Sicily suggests that the transpressional tectonics in these sectors of the chain was active at least since the latest Tortonian till at least the Late Pliocene...|$|R
40|$|Overfilled incised valleys develop {{when the}} rate of {{sediment}} supply outpaces {{the rate of}} accommodation. An overfilled incised valley presents simple or compound valley-fill architecture, depending on {{the depth of the}} valley incision, compared with the height reached by the following sea-level rise. The Ventimiglia incised valley, exposed on the Ligurian coast, north-western Mediterranean margin, presents a spectacular example of compound incised-valley fill, developed in perennial “overfill” conditions. The valley was subaerially incised during the Messinian Salinity Crisis and rapidly flooded by the sea at the beginning of Pliocene, then filled by eleven coarse-grained Gilbert-type deltas during Early–Middle Pliocene time. The basal Messinian unconformity is locally paved with subaerial scree breccias and bioclastic shallowmarine sandstones, and blanketed by <b>bathyal</b> marls. These <b>deposits</b> record the lowstand, transgressive and early-highstand systems tracts of the first valley-fill sequence. The subsequent progradation of Gilbert-type deltas occurred in four stages, or depositional sequences, separated by transgressive marine-marl intervals. Within each depositional sequence, the deltaic bodies display offlapping architecture, recording falling shoreline trajectory, downward shifts in facies, and overall forced regression. The water depth and accommodation in the inundated coastal valley was gradually decreasing with time. The reduced accommodation allowed the youngest deltas to prograde out to the shelf edge, triggering mass collapses and subsequent filling into the newly created slump scars. Some of the deltas probably acted as “canyon perched deltas” and supplied sediment to the deep-water slope and floor of the Ligurian Basin. The vertical stacking of Gilbert-type deltas is usually attributed, in tectonically active basins, to fault-related subsidence pulses. In Ventimiglia, the accommodation was created by high-frequency eustatic sea-level rises that, probably accompanied by climate controlled reductions in sediment supply, temporarily outpaced uplift, leading to the development of multiple cycles of infill...|$|R
40|$|Seismic {{reflection}} data on {{the shelf}} offshore Guatemala reveal the stratigraphy of the forearc basin that has devel-oped {{as the result of}} Tertiary subduction on the site of a Cretaceous passive margin. Abyssal Cretaceous and Paleocene sequences that presently dip landward to the northeast probably originally downlapped across a seaward-dipping conti-nental rise surface. The termination of the thick Paleocene sequence at the shelf edge is probably a postdepositional tec-tonic truncation. A <b>bathyal</b> Eocene-Oligocene sequence <b>deposited</b> in the forearc subsequent to the initiation of subduc-tion is truncated by a sharp angular unconformity, which indicates severe tilting and erosion of the forearc basin prior to subsidence and the deposition of the seaward-thickening early Miocene sequence. A late Miocene and Pliocene unit thins seaward, indicating renewed uplift of the shelf edge. A Quaternary sequence progrades across the gently tilted up-per Miocene-Pliocene sequence toward San José Canyon. Major unconformities of the forearc basin were coeval with major plate reorganizations. A major reorganization of the Pacific-Farallon spreading center, which occurred in the late Paleocene, may have coincided with or preceded the up-lift of the Guatemala shelf edge and the inception of subduction in this region. A late Oligocene disruption of the Faral-lon Plate forming the Nazca and Cocos plates coincided with renewed subsidence of the shelf edge associated with the seaward-thickening early Miocene sequence. In the middle Miocene another plate reorganization, which led to a much shortened Pacific-Cocos plate boundary, may have coincided with renewed uplift of the shelf edge. The regional Plio-cene-Pleistocene unconformity may be associated with an eastward jump in the Pacific-Cocos spreading center from the Mathematician spreading center to the present East Pacific Rise. The causal mechanism relating plate reorganizations to ocean margin crustal dynamics may involve the changing pattern of forces driving an oceanic plate as {{the size and shape of}} the plate change...|$|R
