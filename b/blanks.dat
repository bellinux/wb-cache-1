Spain had recently begun making handmade spliced <b>blanks</b> and was supplying them to Balabushka's closest rival, Frank Paradise. Spain had become fascinated by splicing technology when he came upon a Titlist cue split down the middle in 1965 {{and set out to}} perfect and even improve on the Titlist splice. Spain's original intent was to be predominantly a cuemaker in his own right using his proprietary spliced <b>blanks.</b> However, by 1966 Spain's superior <b>blanks</b> were in high demand and he instead turned to making <b>blanks</b> for other cuemakers full-time, which he continued until 1970.|$|E

Though he too started production with Titlist <b>blanks</b> as well as <b>blanks</b> manufactured by WICO of Chicago, Szamboti later began making his own.

40|$|Abstract. Fine-blanking with {{negative}} clearance {{is a kind}} of fine <b>blanking</b> processes. The punch size of fine-blanking {{with negative}} clearance is larger than the die size. The paper does lots of simulations for the changes of <b>blanking</b> force in fine-blanking with negative clearance and common <b>blanking</b> by DEFORM software, and the <b>blanking</b> force curves are gained by these experiments. The changing principle of <b>blanking</b> force and internal material is obtained through the simulation and experiments. The result shows that simulation <b>blanking</b> force of AISI- 1045 is lager than the actual <b>blanking</b> force. According to the curves derived from experiments, we can see that the maximum <b>blanking</b> force of fine-blanking with negative clearance is higher than common <b>blanking</b> force. Compared with fine-blanking with negative clearance, the common <b>blanking</b> force reduces faster after the <b>blanking</b> force reaches maximum value. The experiment result shows that the force of fine-blanking with negative clearance under a smaller <b>blanking</b> clearance is a bit bigger than the force of common <b>blanking</b> force, and the <b>blanking</b> quality of fine-blanking with negative clearance is much better than that of common <b>blanking.</b> Cracks can be closed effectively by the special squeeze forming in fine <b>blanking</b> with negative clearance. Then, the crack can not expand continuously, and the bonding force is enhanced. The squeeze forming can restrain intergranular deformation and reduce the damage. However, the stretch forming easily leads to the inner crack and defect of materials. By means of the analysis on experimental curves, the paper further studies the changing law of fine-blanking with negative clearance <b>blanking</b> force...|$|R

40|$|<b>Blank</b> {{design is}} an {{important}} task in sheet metal forming process optimization. The initial <b>blank</b> shape has direct effect on the part quality. This paper presents a deformation based <b>blank</b> design approach to determine the initial <b>blank</b> shape for a formed part. The <b>blank</b> design approach is integrated separately into ABAQUS, and DD 3 IMP, a research purpose in-house FEA code, to demonstrate its compatibility with any FEA code. The algorithm uses FE results to optimize the <b>blank</b> shape for a part. Deep drawing simulation of a rectangular cup geometry was carried out with an initial <b>blank</b> shape determined empirically. The <b>blank</b> shape was iteratively modified, based on the deformation history, until an optimal <b>blank</b> shape for the part is achieved. The optimal <b>blank</b> shapes predicted by the algorithm using both FEA softwares were similar. Marginal differences in the shape error indicate that the deformation history based push/pull technique can effectively determine an optimal <b>blank</b> shape for a part with any FEA software. For the shape error selected, both procedures estimate the optimal <b>blank</b> shape for the part within five iterations. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The summer of 1936 was {{the peak of}} the commemorative coin boom, and Melish announced the new pieces would be sold in sets of three by mint mark for $7.75 (a high price at that time). Order <b>blanks</b> were sent to those who had written early, and soon these <b>blanks</b> were selling for $10. Yet few collectors were successful in having their orders filled, with most having their payment returned as the coins had supposedly sold out. The sets quickly jumped in price to $40. At this high level, many coins proved available. Numismatist Q. David Bowers stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by Melish and other insiders. Melish also allowed the issuers of the York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar to purchase, at the original issue price, several sets—members of the public could order at most one set at that price. In return, he sought to purchase that and other commemorative coins in quantities beyond the usual order limit. Nevertheless, when the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, issuer of the long-lived half dollar honoring the trail, tried to purchase a set, Melish replied that they were sold out.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Machining {{experiments}} of fine-blanking {{with negative}} clearance {{show that the}} <b>blanking</b> force {{is very different from}} ordinary <b>blanking</b> in different <b>blanking</b> stages. Studying on the <b>blanking</b> force size of fine-blanking with negative clearance in different <b>blanking</b> stages is a very important significance for studying die wear and analyzing the state of material stress-strain. Firstly, numerical simulation and stress state analysis of the fine-blanking with negative clearance are carried out, with DEFORM-metal forming finite element analysis software. Afterward the relationship curve of <b>blanking</b> force and stroke are measured, and the <b>blanking</b> force with different <b>blanking</b> stages of fine-blanking with negative clearance is analyzed by the simulation and the experiment. The analysis result shows that the simulation <b>blanking</b> force is bigger than the experimental result (error about 15 %), but the <b>blanking</b> force variation tendency is accordant. while the punch pushes down within 0. 1 mm, the <b>blanking</b> force changes quickly. The metal sheet will enter into the state of plastic deformation after the <b>blanking</b> force reaching maximum value. Along with the punch continues to move down, the area of shear zone is decrescent so that the <b>blanking</b> force inches down, and the <b>blanking</b> force reaches a certain value in the place of <b>blanking</b> allowance value finally. With punch pushing the metal sheet to enter the plastic state and punch downward the place of the allowance value, the metal sheet sustained the big <b>blanking</b> force all the time as well as the deformation zone material keeps the plastic deformation. The research result provides theoretic reference and the experimental data for the practice application of fine-blanking with negative clearance, and has instructive significance and reference value to mould design...|$|R
