25|$|James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten, {{new head}} {{writers of the}} series, were {{reluctant}} to state whether or not Havins would be departing the soap opera. In their interview with TV Guide, the two remained ambiguous about the matter, though hinting at a recast. Barbara Esensten commented:It’s {{out there that we}} will probably lose her, and it certainly isn’t our choice. However, we’re still writing the show as if she’s not leaving. If we should have to recast Babe, we’ll help the actor take over the part by writing specifically for the new actor like what we did with the Greenlee recast. We saw some little things in Sabine Singh (Greenlee), so we wrote for her accordingly, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into real trouble when you completely change the character for a recast. Luckily, Jim and I don’t have any trouble separating the actor from a character because the latter is really paramount in our eyes.|$|E
500|$|After a stint {{with the}} {{short-lived}} Army Service Training Program, Groza was sent with the 96th Infantry Division {{to serve as}} a surgical technician in Leyte, Okinawa, and other places in the Pacific theater in 1945. The day he landed in the Philippines, Groza saw a soldier shot in the face. He was stationed in a bank of tents about five miles from the front lines and helped doctors tend to the wounded. [...] "I saw a lot of men wounded with severe injuries", he later said. [...] "Lose legs, guts hanging out, stuff like that. It's a tough thing, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> hardened to it, and you accept it as part of your being there." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Bale breaking {{his hand and}} Worthington hurting his back, special effects technician Mike Menardis almost lost his leg filming an explosion. The sequence required a manhole cover being blown into the air, which hit Menardis and partially severed his leg. McG noted it was {{a testament to the}} gritty style of the film. [...] "I say with respect, I didn't want that Star Wars experience of everything's a blue screen, tennis balls, and go for it. I had Stan Winston build all the machines. We built all the sets, the explosive power, the explosive power so you feel that wind and that percussion and that heat blowing your eyebrows off. And with that, you get a couple bumps and bruises on the way, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> it in an integrity and a realism that hopefully echoes Apocalypse Now. You couldn't say, 'Let's just shoot Apocalypse Now in Burbank, I think it's going to feel just as good.|$|E

2500|$|Natalie: [...] "We {{tried to}} write about the {{incident}} a few times, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> nervous that you're being too preachy or too victimized or too nonchalant. Dan came in with an idea that was some kind of concession, more 'can't we all just get along?' and I said, nope, I can't say that, can't do it. And we talked about it, and he said, what about [...] "I'm not ready to make nice?" [...] From the outside, normal people really weren't aware of how bizarre and absurd it got. Dan was really good at cluing in to that, saying something that didn't back down, but still had a vulnerability to it. This album was therapy. To write these songs allowed me to find peace with everything and move on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ian Beale {{has gone}} on to be the longest running {{character}} in the soap's history and, until the returns of Sharon Watts in August 2012, Kathy Beale in February 2015 and Michelle Fowler in December 2016, was the only remaining original character. Woodyatt confirmed his desire to remain with the show in 2010, during the show's 25th anniversary: [...] "Why would I want to leave when I'm {{not going to get the}} chance to portray even half the range of emotions I get to here in a one-off drama or a six-part series? And you're not going to get the same viewing figures either. You have your moments when things go wrong and you perhaps don't want to work with a certain person. In any office there are going to be people who don't get along <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> on with it and on the whole I enjoy it. Over the last couple of years we've had a really tight crew and it's the best atmosphere I can remember. There have been peaks and troughs, like with any show, but right now things are good." ...|$|E

2500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{the return of}} Lennie James as Morgan Jones in a brief uncredited post-end credits cameo. It marked his third appearance in the show, after the pilot, [...] "Days Gone Bye", and the season three episode [...] "Clear". Gimple explained {{in an interview with}} The Hollywood Reporter that Morgan's appearance was the [...] "beginning of something" [...] for the character, but would not state further; he instead said, [...] "Looking at him, how he's dressed, how he's acting — it's not a 42-minute episode there — <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> some hints about where he's at. I would look at that carefully." [...] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he also noted that Morgan was [...] "definitely dressed better than the last time we saw him. He looks pretty well put together. You know, he’s not talking to himself. I would say that, just laying eyes on him, it looks like a different Morgan." [...] Kirkman stated that Morgan was possibly following Rick's trail, as Rick left him a map in [...] "Clear". He also said that the post-credits scene was used not only to surprise the audience, but to also [...] " [...] story of this episode...into its own contiguous piece." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nina was {{a singing}} {{champion}} on Tanghalan ng Kampeon, with her winning pieces [...] "Better Days" [...] and [...] "Love Takes Time". She expressed {{having so much}} sacrifices for her singing career, stating [...] "I always order Halo-halo without ice. If I want to eat ice cream, I have to let it melt first or else microwave it. I also don’t eat spicy food or mint candies." [...] She explained, [...] "Of course, {{it was hard for}} me [...] <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> used to it." [...] She also sings twenty songs a day for practice. She takes good care of her voice and maintains a healthy diet, and swore it takes her only three days or less to recover from throat infections. In her 2011 documentary on TvN Asia, it was revealed that despite all the fame and success, Nina still regularly comes back to the Center for Pop Music to train her vocals and make it even stronger. She is also known for doing covers of popular hits. She expressed herself in a statement, saying [...] "I can say that the songs I sing in my albums very much represent who I am [...] I try to make it my own even if it was done originally by another artist." ...|$|E

The pumpkin is a good vegetable, and the fowls will thank you for a bit to pick, when you can spare one.
