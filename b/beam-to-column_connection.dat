40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop new type of frames made of reusable members. The frame consists of three parts: circular CFT (concrete-filled tube) columns, wide flange steel beams and beam-to-column connections that are made of circular tube with wide flange shape brackets. These parts are all prefabricated in the shop. When we reuse the structural members of the frame, all members must be taken apart easily. For this reason, beams are connected to <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection</b> by high-strength bolts and splicing plates, and columns are just set into the tube of <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection.</b> The gap between two tubes (CFT column and <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection)</b> is filled by high strength mortar. In order to clarify the elastic-plastic characteristics of this frame, he T-shape frame models consisting of CFT column and <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection</b> were tested under the constant axial load and cyclic horizontal load...|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} system of post-tensioned pre-stressed steel beams with concrete filled tubular (CFT) columns has remarkable performance in strength, ductility, load-bearing capacity and construction duration. After {{the structure is}} experienced an earthquake, the beams and columns can return to their original location. However, behavior of <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection</b> is so complicated {{that it is not}} widely applied. For the beam-to-column connections of this {{structural system}}, a detail design method was proposed in this research. The end of H-beam was welded with X-shaped damper. Then the X-shaped damper was bolted to the CFT column as an energy dissipation element to ensure the integrity of the major structural elements while experiencing an earthquake. This research established a mechanics model of the <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection</b> and performed a series of structural earthquake-resistant experiments. The research results proved the <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection</b> have remarkable earthquake-resistant performance in strength, ductility, energy dissipation and self-centering ability. The structural system remained standing strong even when story drift reached 6 % and plastic angular of displacement of the <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection</b> reached 5 %. It demonstrates the earthquake-resistant performance of this <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection</b> exceeds the regulatory requirements for earthquake-resistant connections in Taiwan and U. S...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{of steel and}} composite frames has traditionally been carried out by idealizing <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connections</b> as either rigid or pinned. Although some advanced analysis methods have been proposed to account for semi-rigid connections, the performance of these methods strongly depends on the proper modeling of connection behavior. The primary challenge of modeling <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connections</b> is their inelastic response and continuously varying stiffness, strength, and ductility. In this dissertation, two distinct approaches—mathematical models and informational models— are proposed {{to account for the}} complex hysteretic behavior of <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connections.</b> The performance of the two approaches is examined and is then followed by a discussion of their merits and deficiencies. To capitalize on the merits of both mathematical and informational representations, a new approach, a hybrid modeling framework, is developed and demonstrated through modeling <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connections.</b> Component-based modeling is a compromise spanning two extremes in the fiel...|$|R

Fracture tests of full-scale models of <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connections</b> {{were carried out}} (Morita, 1999, and Yoshimura, 2006). Cyclic loading tests were conducted, which included dynamic loading tests. Brittle fracture occurred from weld defects (lack of fusion or weld crack) or artificial defects in <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connections.</b> In accordance with WES 2808, the fracture strain at the beam end in the connection was evaluated.

In one frame both the <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connections</b> and the columns themselves were protected, while in the other test only the <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connections</b> were protected.

40|$|The {{performance}} of precast concrete frames {{depends on the}} behaviour of connection. The configuration of connections between beam-to-column affects the constructability, stability, strength, flexibility and residual force in the structure. In addition, connections {{play a key role}} in the dissipation of energy and redistribution of loads. This paper describes the comparative study on testing between rigid and precast beam-to-column connections to obtain the important characteristics of the connections such as the load-displacement and moment-rotation relationship. The objective of the study is to propose a <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection</b> using hollow steel section for precast concrete frames and to determine experimentally the moment resistance and rotation of the proposed <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection.</b> In this study, three specimens comprised two precast concrete <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection</b> using hollow steel section and one rigid <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection</b> were considered.

The new-type beam-to-column joint in a precast concrete frame consisted of cast-in-place columns and precast beams. Test results showed that（a）The property and action of precast connections are similar to the cast-in-place connection, it showed that both precast connections and cast-in-place connection have similar seismic performance; (b) The cracking load of precast connection are similar to the cast-in-place connection; (c) All the columns of all specimens did not destroy, it illustrate that it conform to the strong column weak beam.

40|$|The {{connection}} between beam and column affects directly {{the integrity of}} the building structure, In precast reinforced concrete Industrialised Building Systems (IBS), complexity often occurred in the implementation of a new type of <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection.</b> "This is due to the new IBS arrangement and the consequent new interaction between the jointed elements of beam and column, In this study, an innovative new type of semi-rigid <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection,</b> called SMART IBS consisting of beam to column steel connectors and reinforced concrete elements cast together were detailed out. Four full scale experimental tests were conducted to achieve the real behaviour of the connection in H-shape and Cruciform sub-frames. The tests were supplemented with conventional monolithic models representing the moment resisting connection for comparison of structural specifications. Moreover, for obtaining more comprehensive behaviour, nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) using ABAQUS software was conducted. Furthermore, the whole behaviour of IBS using this new connection was researched through 3 D linear analysis to include gravitational and seismic time-history loads using SAP 2000 software, The response of the connection was investigated through the study of the ultimate loading capacity, ductility ratio, load-displacement, moment-rotation, modes of failure and crack patterns. The results of this research confirmed that the new SMART IBS <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection</b> was a semi-rigid connection with extra beneficial ductility in comparison with conventional reinforced concrete connection. The ultimate strength of the SMART IBS <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection</b> was equal to the conventional model.

40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} {{developed}} within {{a research project}} concerning the seismic vulnerability assessment of precast industrial buildings built in Italy in the 1970 ’s without earthquake-resistant provisions. Two reference precast buildings with beam-to-column connections based on neoprene-concrete friction strength were considered. Accurate numerical models of the existing buildings were developed and nonlinear dynamic time-history analyses with different seismic intensity levels were carried out {{in order to identify}} the main causes of structural collapse. The maximum values of the demand-to-capacity ratio in terms of chord rotation were computed for the columns of the investigated precast buildings. The capacity was larger than the demand, even in case of high levels of seismic excitation. Numerical results showed that existing precast industrial buildings can collapse due to <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection</b> failure for loss of support, confirming real events observed during recent earthquakes. The friction resistance was exceeded under moderate-to-severe seismic actions at the corner columns where the static vertical load was lower. Numerical analyses highlighted the detrimental effects of the vertical component of the seismic action on the likelihood of the occurrence of <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connection</b> failure due to loss of support...|$|E

40|$|Steel <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connections</b> are {{vulnerable}} structural elements when a fire strikes a building, as observed in fire incidents and full-scale fire tests. Existing techniques allow researchers {{to model the}} behaviour {{of different types of}} connections in fire but are difficult to use when conducting simulations on full-scale frames with multiple connections due to time and computation requirements. Therefore a need for a simplified connection modelling approach that can significantly reduce the computational time required without compromising on the accuracy of the simulation results so that large-scale simulations of structures with multiple connections in fire can be performed. A simplified spring connection modelling approach for steel flush endplate <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connections</b> in fire has been developed in this research project so that the realistic behaviour of connections can be incorporated into full-scale frame analyses at elevated temperature. The proposed modelling approach divides the connection into two or three (depending on the connection size) T-stubs and employs ABAQUS as a pre-processor to generate the force-displacement characteristics for each T-stub by detailed finite element modelling. These characteristics are then input into specialised software (VULCAN) to simulate the behaviour of structure in fire including realistic representation of the steel <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connections.</b> As a result of its simplicity and reliability, the proposed approach permits full-scale frame analysis in fire to be conducted efficiently. The proposed simplified spring connection modelling approach has been used to investigate the influence of connection ductility (both axial and rotational) on frame behaviour in fire. 2 D steel and 3 D composite frames across a range of spans were modelled to aid the understanding of the differences in frame response in fire when the <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connections</b> have different axial and rotational ductility assumptions. The research study highlights that adopting the conventional rigid or pinned connection assumptions does not permit the axial forces acting on the connections to be predicted accurately, since the axial ductility of the connection is completely neglected when the rotational ductility is either fully restrained or free. By including realistic axial and rotational ductility of the <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connections,</b> the frame response in fire can be predicted more accurately, which is advantageous in performance-based structural fire engineering design...|$|R

The objective of this article is providing the foundation for the design and analysis faster and more economical and securing the required strength for the connection steel. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Nearly seventy-one academic and popular research/literature in the field of steel connections had been studied in which an overview of recent events has made the construction of the system viable in the infrastructure.

40|$|The moment {{capacity}} of structural beams {{is influenced by}} the presence of shear in the beam. In general, the presence of shear reduces the moment carrying {{capacity of}} the beam. Thus, the design of <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connections</b> using capacity design concept should consider the presence of shear in the beam. Current design code specifications for design of <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connections</b> do not consider the effect of reduction in maximum developable moment capacity in the beam, due to the presence of shear. This may result in the heavier connections. In this paper, the interaction between shear and moment, for various AISC beam sections is investigated. Shear-moment curves are analytically developed for a spectrum of AICS sections. It is observed that the shear-moment interaction for the AISC sections may be represented using straight lines. This interaction is used to estimate the maximum shear and moment that is likely to be developed in the beam during extreme earthquake shaking. These shear and moment estimates can be used to design the connections for the beam-column interface. Beam length-to-depth ratios for which the shear-moment interaction becomes significant are calculated. It is shown that for deep beams, neglecting the presence of shear can overestimate the design moment demands, and underestimate the design shear demands for the <b>beam-to-column</b> <b>connections...</b>|$|R

In addition to its importance to study the static behaviour of a structural member, quasi-static behaviour is largely needed to {{be compared with the}} dynamic behaviour of such members in order to investigate the dynamic effect by proposing dynamic increase factors (DIFs). The <b>beam-to-column</b> bolted <b>connections</b> contain various contact surfaces at which the implicit procedure may have difficulties converging, resulting in a large number of iterations.
