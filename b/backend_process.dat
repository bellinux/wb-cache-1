40|$|ABSTRACT: Remote sensing {{technology}} has been widely deployed to detect land change during the past decade. In Taiwan, {{a number of different}} land use / land cover change detection systems have been developed to assist in land use management and administrations and to assist in investigations. This paper details our application of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to facilitate access to heterogeneous land management systems via the national "Integration of Land-Use Monitoring " platform. The platform integrates web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) and Management Information System (MIS) to provide a unified online environment for land change reporting and investigation by different departments and agencies with different policies and requirements.

40|$|The Chip in Duromer {{technology}} for realization of stackable SIPs, {{is similar to}} conventional Molded Interconnect Device (MID) technology, that is usually realized using thermoplastic polymers, combining the functionality of housing and substrate into one device. Advantages of the conventional MID technology are the reduction of parts during assembly by integrating mechanical and electrical functionality into a device and the reduction of space, as MID allows a 3 D integration of devices. Disadvantage of conventional technology, especially if combined with typical technical thermoplastics is the large mismatch in {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) between substrate and advanced microelectronic components as CSP or flip chip. This is reducing the applicability of thermoplastic MID to moderate temperature ranges and/or to rather robust components.

Since TSV provides the advantages of shortening interconnection paths and thinner package size, it is considered as the heart of 3 D integration.

40|$|Even {{after the}} {{successful}} introduction of Cu-based metallization, the electromigration (EM) failure risk has remained {{one of the}} most important reliability concerns for most advanced process technologies. Ever increasing operating current densities and the introduction of low-k materials in the <b>backend</b> <b>process</b> scheme are some of the issues that threaten reliable, long-term operation at elevated temperatures. The traditional method of verifying EM reliability only through current density limit checks is proving to be inadequate in general, or quite expensive at the best. A Statistical EM Budgeting (SEB) methodology has been proposed to assess more realistic chip-level EM reliability from the complex statistical distribution of currents in a chip [1]. To be valuable, this approach requires accurate estimation of currents for all interconnect segments in a chip. However, no efficient technique to manage the complexity of such a task for very large chip designs is known. We present an efficient method to estimate currents exhaustively for all interconnects in a chip. The proposed method uses pre-characterization of cells and macros, and steps to identify and filter out symmetrically bi-directional interconnects.
