5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 365/8, with Evans on 47 not out. Johnston had the pick of the bowling figures, with 4/95. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> wicket and make the surface more likely to spin.|$|E

Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his belief that such a device would only make batting more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Improvement {{continued}} in the nineteenth century. Innovations included the first working reaping machine, developed by Patrick Bell in 1828. His rival James Smith turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> subsoil barrier without disturbing the topsoil. Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production {{and the result was}} the even Lowland landscape that still predominates.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} innings, Loxton took 0/29 from ten overs, and England batted on {{for five minutes}} on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller. This would help to <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> wicket and make the surface more likely to spin, therefore making life more difficult for Australia’s batsmen.|$|E

5|$|On July 1, 1922, 400,000 {{railroad}} workers went on strike. Harding {{proposed a}} settlement that made some concessions, but management objected.

Although there was {{public support for the}} Wilkerson injunction, Harding felt it went too far, and had Daugherty and Wilkerson amend it. The injunction succeeded in ending the strike; however, tensions remained high between railroad workers and management for years.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian sparrowhawk's pale underparts {{and darker}} upperparts are {{an example of}} countershading, which helps to <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> bird's outline. Countershading is {{exhibited}} by birds of prey which hunt birds and other fast-moving animals. The horizontal barring seen on adult Eurasian sparrowhawks is typical of woodland-dwelling predatory birds, while the adult male's bluish colour is also seen in other bird-eating raptors, including the peregrine falcon, the merlin and other Accipiters.|$|E
5|$|The rush: If {{the prey}} {{attempts}} to flee, the wolves immediately pursue it. This {{is the most}} critical stage of the hunt, as wolves may never catch up with prey running at top speed. If their prey is travelling in a group, the wolves either attempt to <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> herd, or isolate one or two animals from it.|$|E
5|$|A Japanese convoy {{approaching}} Endau {{was detected}} by reconnaissance aircraft on 26 January and was ineffectually attacked multiple times by Allied aircraft as it was landing its troops. The Allies suffered heavy casualties, while the Japanese lost only a single aircraft. The Royal Navy committed two destroyers later that day to <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Japanese landings, despite the much larger Japanese escort force. Sailing {{under the cover of}} darkness, they were able to locate the convoy anchored there without being detected, but could not find the troopships in the darkness. The ships attempted to disengage, but were fired upon by the convoy's escorts and one destroyer was sunk {{in the early morning hours}} of 27 January.|$|E

Vandygriff told his troops not to remove the identification tags from the dead they would be leaving behind, as the tags {{would be the only}} means of identification later.

Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army. At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again.|$|E

Riley then advises Ellie to flee, but the latter is caught and assigned to cleaning duty.

The energy released by solvation of the ammonium ions and nitrate ions is less than the energy absorbed in <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ammonium nitrate ionic lattice and the attractions between water molecules. Dissolving potassium hydroxide is exothermic, as more energy is released during solvation than is used in <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> solute and solvent.|$|R

5|$|Disruptive {{patterns}} use strongly contrasting, non-repeating markings such as spots or stripes to <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{outlines of}} an animal or military vehicle, or to conceal telltale features, especially the eyes, as in the common frog. Disruptive patterns may use more than one method to defeat visual systems such as edge detection. Predators like the leopard use disruptive camouflage to help them approach prey, while potential prey like the Egyptian nightjar use it to avoid detection by predators. Disruptive patterning is common in military usage, both for uniforms and for military vehicles. Disruptive patterning, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by factors like shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E
5|$|During his {{ministry}} in England, Toulmin served two Dissenting congregations in Lancashire. From 1786 to 1788, he was pastor {{of a church}} in Monton, and from 1787 to 1793, he served another congregation at Chowbent Chapel in Atherton. He soon had nearly 1,000 followers, Many of his followers supported the French Revolution, attracting the attention of anti-dissenting partisans in England. A group of these partisans once took advantage of Toulmin's absence to threaten his house, necessitating his swift return to protect his family. Upon arriving, {{he was able to}} <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> mob via diplomacy alone.|$|E

Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller {{at the start of}} the morning, which would help <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> wicket and make it more likely to spin. Bradman had done a similar thing during the previous Ashes series in Australia before setting England a target. The hosts needed to beat Australia to avoid a series defeat. Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his opinion that such a device would make the surface less favourable for batting.|$|E
