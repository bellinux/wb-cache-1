To identify the genes for field resistance to rice blast, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) con-ferring the resistance for races and <b>blast</b> nursery <b>screening</b> in japonica rice cultivars were detected and mapped using SSR markers. QTL analysis was carried out in 190 RILs population from the cross between Suweon 365 (moderately resistant) and Chucheong (highly susceptible). Twelve QTLs against nine blast races inoculated were detected on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 11 and 12. They explained from 5. 1 % to 34. 9 % of total phenotypic variation. Eight QTLs against <b>blast</b> nursery <b>screening</b> in four regions for three years were detected on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 11 and 12. The phenotypic variation explained by each QTL ranged from 4. 3 % to 37. 7 %.

To date, only one apicomplexan oocyst membrane protein has been identified, Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein 1 (COWP 1). COWP 1 has a highly cysteine-rich periodicity due to arrays of two apicomplexan-specific motifs, designated the type I and type II domains. In this study, exhaustive <b>BLAST</b> <b>screening</b> of a complete C. parvum genome sequence database resulted in identification of eight additional genes encoding similar arrays of cysteine-rich type I and/or type II domains. Transcript expression analysis revealed that all COWP genes are abundantly expressed {{at a time when}} developing oocysts are observed, roughly 48 to 72 h after inoculation of in vitro cultures.

Weisolated 192 microsatellite markers by using pyrosequencing and screened 15 individuals from eight isofamilies collected from three geographical areas: Puerto Rico (PR), Texas (TX), and Mississippi (MS). Isofamilies resistant to Cry toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner) (Bacillales: Bacillaceae) also were included. Cluster analysis was performed to determine the potential use of these SSRs in discriminating populations, and colonies were grouped with a reliability of 100 % estimated by bootstrap. In this analysis, colonies from TX grouped away from those from PR, but the two MS isofamilies grouped with TX and PR separately. Genetic distance within isofamilies ranged between 0. 22 and 0. 56, and the minimum distance between isofamilies was 0. 83. Unique pattern informative combination (UPIC) scores were calculated, and the 80 SSR markers that had UPIC scores of≥ 1 are listed according to their discriminating potential.

40|$|Quarrying can {{generate}} {{a number of}} on-site and off-site environmental effects {{as a result of}} <b>blasting,</b> excavation, crushing, <b>screening,</b> stockpiling and transport activities. Blasting is necessary for recovery of ore and production of aggregates in most underground and open cut mines, as well as in quarries. However, blasting can cause noise and ground vibration, which can have an impact upon nearby structures and people living close by. Hence, proper control of blasting practices is necessary to ensure both the safety of employees and the protection of the community from adverse effects. In Thudugala, in Kaluthura district, people those who are living close to quarries are highly subjected to these effects due to quarry blasting. In these circumstances, it was decided to conduct a research into the ground vibration impact in the area. Due to complexity of structures ranging from wattle-and-daub structures which do not have proper foundations to those built with good foundations, the applicability of single criteria of 5 mm/sec PPV level of vibration which is currently being used in Sri Lanka is inadequate. It is also noted that the above vibration criteria has been adopted in Sri Lanka without a proper theoretical foundation. In this research program, the propagation of cracks due to the blasting was assessed at the initial stage of the project. At the final stage, the optimum PPV values will have to be found for different types of structures by constructing them. In this area soil overburden is less. Therefore most of the structures have been constructed on rock. When blasting takes place, rock tends to vibrate and the intensity perceived is very high. Therefore crack propagation is high in these particular structures. It is also noticed that the cracks have further developed between the period between pre-blast crack survey and post-blast crack survey. It is due to large number of un-monitored blasts that have been conducted during that period. Therefore to solve this problem, it is recommended to carry out continuous monitoring of blasts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background It is {{difficult}} to accurately interpret chromosomal correspondences such as true orthology and paralogy due to significant divergence of genomes from a common ancestor. Analyses are particularly problematic among lineages that have repeatedly experienced whole genome duplication (WGD) events. To compare multiple "subgenomes" derived from genome duplications, we need to relax the traditional requirements of "one-to-one" syntenic matchings of genomic regions in order to reflect "one-to-many" or more generally "many-to-many" matchings. However this relaxation may result {{in the identification of}} synteny blocks that are derived from ancient shared WGDs that are not of interest. For many downstream analyses, we need to eliminate weak, low scoring alignments from pairwise genome comparisons. Our goal is to objectively select subset of synteny blocks whose total scores are maximized while respecting the duplication history of the genomes in comparison. We call this "quota-based" screening of synteny blocks in order to appropriately fill a quota of syntenic relationships within one genome or between two genomes having WGD events. Results We have formulated the synteny block screening as an optimization problem known as "Binary Integer Programming" (BIP), which is solved using existing linear programming solvers. The computer program QUOTA-ALIGN performs this task by creating a clear objective function that maximizes the compatible set of synteny blocks under given constraints on overlaps and depths (corresponding to the duplication history in respective genomes). Such a procedure is useful for any pairwise synteny alignments, but is most useful in lineages affected by multiple WGDs, like plants or fish lineages. For example, there should be a 1 : 2 ploidy relationship between genome A and B if genome B had an independent WGD subsequent to the divergence of the two genomes. We show through simulations and real examples using plant genomes in the rosid superorder that the quota-based screening can eliminate ambiguous synteny blocks and focus on specific genomic evolutionary events, like the divergence of lineages (in cross-species comparisons) and the most recent WGD (in self comparisons). Conclusions The QUOTA-ALIGN algorithm screens a set of synteny blocks to retain only those compatible with a user specified ploidy relationship between two genomes. These blocks, in turn, may be used for additional downstream analyses such as identifying true orthologous regions in interspecific comparisons. There are two major contributions of QUOTA-ALIGN: 1) reducing the block screening task to a BIP problem, which is novel; 2) providing an efficient software pipeline starting from all-against-all <b>BLAST</b> to the <b>screened</b> synteny blocks with dot plot visualizations.

40|$|M. Sc. (Botany) In South Africa, {{controlling}} and eradicating Azolla filiculoides and Eichhornia crassipes cost annually approximately US$ 60 {{million to the}} national budget. However, {{the success of these}} operations is mixed because invasive aquatic plants often spread very rapidly either before they are spotted or before decisions are taken to implement control actions. This limitation is further exacerbated by difficulties in determining the invasion potential of newly introduced or unknown aquatic plants, as well as difficulties inherent to species identification. Resolving these drawbacks requires pre-emptive actions such as identifying areas that are most vulnerable to invasion by alien plants. In this study, I first explore whether molecular technique such as DNA barcoding can be useful to: i) overcome potential limitation of morphology-based identification of invasive aquatic plants; and ii) establish successful control of these invasives. For this purpose, I tested the utility of official DNA barcodes (rbcLa + matK or core barcodes), trnH-psbA, and the core barcode + trnH-psbA to identify invasive aquatic plants of South Africa’s freshwaters. Second, I use the technique of ecological niche modeling to identify most vulnerable freshwater systems to species invasion under current and climatic conditions. My analysis indicates that the core barcodes and matK regions perform poorer compared to trnH-psbA, which provides 100 % successful identification alone or in combination with the core barcodes. This study therefore validates trnH-psbA as single best DNA barcode for invasive alien aquatic plants of freshwater systems in South Africa. Using this DNA region in <b>BLAST</b> analysis to <b>screen</b> plants species sold in aquarium market in Johannesburg, I found surprisingly that some prohibited species are already in circulation in the market. These include Hydrilla verticillata, egeria densa, Myriophyllum spicatum, and Echinodorus cordifolius. Furthermore, based on climatic parameters, I explored the distribution of the "bad five" aquatic species in South Africa, i. e. the most damaging invaders of freshwater systems. I found distinct distribution potentials for these species under current climatic conditions. Overall, 38 % of all South Africa’s dams occur in areas climatically vulnerable to the invasion by the bad five with the Western Cape Province being the most vulnerable. However, under predicted climate change scenario, I found evidence for contrasting shifts in species range: species such as Azolla filiculoides, Eichhornia crassipes, Salvinia molesta might increase their range by at most 2 % whilst the ranges of Myriophyllum aquaticum and Pistia stratiotes might contract by at most 5 %. This range contraction and expansion will result in some dams currently vulnerable to invasion becoming resilient whilst others that are currently resilient might become vulnerable owing to climate change. This result demonstrates not only the utility of DNA barcoding in implementing control measures, but also provides ways of prioritising control/management efforts...|$|R
40|$|Background: It is {{difficult}} to accurately interpret chromosomal correspondences such as true orthology and paralogy due to significant divergence of genomes from a common ancestor. Analyses are particularly problematic among lineages that have repeatedly experienced whole genome duplication (WGD) events. To compare multiple “subgenomes” derived from genome duplications, we need to relax the traditional requirements of “one-to-one” syntenic matchings of genomic regions in order to reflect “one-to-many” or more generally “many-to-many” matchings. However this relaxation may result {{in the identification of}} synteny blocks that are derived from ancient shared WGDs that are not of interest. For many downstream analyses, we need to eliminate weak, low scoring alignments from pairwise genome comparisons. Our goal is to objectively select subset of synteny blocks whose total scores are maximized while respecting the duplication history of the genomes in comparison. We call this “quota-based” screening of synteny blocks in order to appropriately fill a quota of syntenic relationships within one genome or between two genomes having WGD events. Results: We have formulated the synteny block screening as an optimization problem known as “Binary Integer Programming” (BIP), which is solved using existing linear programming solvers. The computer program QUOTAALIGN performs this task by creating a clear objective function that maximizes the compatible set of synteny blocks under given constraints on overlaps and depths (corresponding to the duplication history in respective genomes). Such a procedure is useful for any pairwise synteny alignments, but is most useful in lineages affected by multiple WGDs, like plants or fish lineages. For example, there should be a 1 : 2 ploidy relationship between genome A and B if genome B had an independent WGD subsequent to the divergence of the two genomes. We show through simulations and real examples using plant genomes in the rosid superorder that the quota-based screening can eliminate ambiguous synteny blocks and focus on specific genomic evolutionary events, like the divergence of lineages (in cross-species comparisons) and the most recent WGD (in self comparisons).
