He <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> in 1996 with Louder Than Words, {{on which he}} resisted any change of style or the musical fashion-hopping of the past decade, sticking instead with his chosen path of well-crafted soul music, which {{in the intervening years}} has become known as contemporary R.|$|E
25|$|In 1857, when Nicholas and all men {{involved}} in pressing the Constantine rouble were already dead, general Fyodor Schubert (1789–1865) <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> and published {{a brief description}} of a Constantine ruble from his private collection.

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the second}} season, he was shot, which {{affected}} his control of his right-hand. His temporary fix to this possibly long-term problem was to work together with Cristina during every one of his surgeries so that she could take over in case he might have trouble with his hand. The arrangement fell apart after Cristina, reacting to growing stress after George O'Malley (T. R. Knight) caught onto their secret, went to the Chief and confessed everything. Initially, he was engaged in a cold war with Cristina, where neither of them spoke. However, after she <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> <b>silence,</b> he proposed to her and she accepted his proposal. Before their secret was revealed, Burke was to become the next Chief of Surgery, but he had to compete with his fellow attendings for the position. He has since recovered from the injury, after Derek operated on him. For the remainder of the season, Preston and Cristina prepared for the wedding and experienced normal stresses that result from such a process, such as meeting each other's parents.|$|E

2500|$|By January 1801, Asbury {{was reading}} the {{accounts}} of the Logan County and Cumberland area revivals to Methodist congregations on his circuit and writing about them to Stith Meade, a fellow Methodist itinerate presiding over the Georgia [...] district. [...] As he rode through North and South Carolina, Asbury relayed McGready’s account of the revivals, kindling the hope among his fellow Methodists that similar outpourings might occur among them. [...] Asbury had encountered the Cumberland area revivals in October 1800. [...] Battling discouragement because of the lethargy of religious interest he had seen, he was traveling westward through Kentucky from the Bluegrass area. [...] He turned south before reaching Logan County and headed toward Nashville; his journal reflected his mood on Thursday, Oct. 16, 1800: [...] “In travelling nearly six hundred measured miles, we have had only six appointments; and at these but small congregations: we have wearied ourselves in vain!." [...] By Sunday, after he had reached Tennessee his mood had changed. [...] He spent the day among many of the revival ministers—Hodge, Rankin, the McGee brothers and Thomas Craighead—as well as a thousand worshippers, many camping {{on the grounds of}} the meeting house. [...] By Tuesday, his journal reflected the scene in pastoral language, noting that a stand had been erected, “embosomed in a wood of lofty beech trees. [...] The ministers of God, Methodists and Presbyterians, united their labors and mingled with the childlike simplicity of primitive times.” [...] Asbury echoed McGready’s account of the meetings and activities extending into the night as he wrote of “fires blazing here and there [...] dispelled the darkness” as “the shouts of the redeemed captives, and the cries of the precious souls struggling into life <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> of midnight ...|$|E
