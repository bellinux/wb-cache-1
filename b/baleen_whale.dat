5|$|The {{gray whale}} {{has been placed}} {{in a family of}} its own as it is {{sufficiently}} different from the right whales and the rorquals. The gray whale is the only benthic feeding <b>baleen</b> <b>whale,</b> filtering small organisms from the mud of shallow seas. They also have a gestation period of over a year, which is unusual for baleen whales.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales (systematic name Mysticeti), known earlier as {{whalebone}} whales, form a parvorder of the infraorder Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises). They are {{a widely}} distributed and diverse parvorder of carnivorous marine mammals. Mysticeti comprise the families Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale). There are currently 15 species of <b>baleen</b> <b>whale.</b> While cetaceans were historically {{thought to have}} descended from mesonychids, molecular evidence supports them as relatives of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla). Baleen whales split from toothed whales (Odontoceti) around 34 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{extinction}} of megalodon {{set the stage}} for further changes in marine communities. The average body size of baleen whales increased significantly after its disappearance, although possibly due to other, climate-related, causes. Conversely however, the increase in <b>baleen</b> <b>whale</b> size {{may have contributed to the}} {{extinction of}} megalodon, as they may have preferred to go after smaller whales; bite marks on large whale species may have come from scavenging sharks. Megalodon may have simply become coextinct with smaller whale species, such as Piscobalaena nana. The extinction of megalodon had a positive impact on other apex predators of the time, such as the great white shark, in some cases spreading to regions where megalodon became absent.|$|E

5|$|The fin whale's body is {{long and}} slender, {{coloured}} brownish-grey with a paler underside. The fin whale is a large <b>baleen</b> <b>whale</b> that belongs to the Cetacean order, which includes all species of whale, dolphin and porpoise. At least two recognized subspecies exist, in the North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere. It is found in all the major oceans, from polar to tropical waters. It is absent only from waters close to the ice pack at the poles and relatively small areas of water away from the open ocean. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. Its food consists of small schooling fish, squid, and crustaceans including copepods and krill.|$|E
5|$|The {{killer whale}} or orca (Orcinus orca) is a toothed whale {{belonging}} to the oceanic dolphin family, {{of which it is}} the largest member. Killer whales have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and dolphins. They have been known to attack <b>baleen</b> <b>whale</b> calves, and even adult whales. Killer whales are apex predators, as there is no animal that preys on them. Killer whales are considered a cosmopolitan species, and can be found in each of the world's oceans in a variety of marine environments, from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas.|$|E

50|$|Minke whale {{is one of}} {{the most}} common species still hunted in {{substantial}} numbers. <b>Baleen</b> <b>whales</b> other than the minke are endangered, though they are taken in numbers by indigenous peoples who traditionally hunt them, and more lately, the whaling nations have resumed hunting larger <b>baleen</b> <b>whales</b> openly.|$|R
25|$|Some marine animals, such as {{whales and}} dolphins, use {{echolocation}} systems, sometimes called biosonar to locate predators and prey. Research {{on the effects}} of sonar on blue whales in the Southern California Bight shows that mid-frequency sonar use disrupts the whales' feeding behavior. This indicates that sonar-induced disruption of feeding and displacement from high-quality prey patches could have significant and previously undocumented impacts on <b>baleen</b> <b>whale</b> foraging ecology, individual fitness and population health.|$|E
25|$|After {{the gray}} whale {{was removed from}} the Endangered Species List, the Makah re-asserted their whaling rights. With the support and {{guidance}} of the United States government and the International Whaling Commission, the Makah successfully hunted a gray whale on May 17, 1999. According to federal law, the Makah are entitled to hunt and kill one <b>baleen</b> <b>whale,</b> typically a gray whale, each year. Archaeological records and oral history indicate a significant number of humpback whales were historically hunted as well.|$|E
25|$|E. japonica {{is a very}} large, thickset <b>baleen</b> <b>whale.</b> It {{very closely}} resembles the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis) the {{southern}} right whale (E. australis), so much so they were long thought to be just one species. Indeed, without knowing which ocean an individual came from, the physical similarities are so extensive that individuals can only be identified to species by genetic analysis. Relative to the other right whale species, E. japonica may be slightly larger. Like other baleen whales, female North Pacific right whales are larger than males. Also, North Pacific brindle-colored individuals are less common than they are among southern right whales.|$|E
5|$|<b>Baleen</b> <b>whales</b> have a small, yet functional, vomeronasal organ. This allows <b>baleen</b> <b>whales</b> {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey. It {{is thought that}} 'tasting' the water is important for finding prey and tracking down other whales. They {{are believed to have}} an impaired sense of smell {{due to the lack of}} the olfactory bulb, but they do have an olfactory tract. <b>Baleen</b> <b>whales</b> have few if any taste buds, suggesting they have lost their sense of taste. They do retain salt-receptor taste-buds suggesting that they can taste saltiness.|$|R
50|$|The two modern parvorders of {{cetaceans}} - Mysticeti (<b>baleen</b> <b>whales)</b> and Odontoceti (toothed whales) - {{are thought}} to have separated from each other, from the archaeocetes, around 28-33 million years ago in a second cetacean radiation, the first occurring with the archaeocetes. The adaptation of echolocation in toothed whales distinguishes them from fully aquatic archaeocetes and early <b>baleen</b> <b>whales.</b> The presence of <b>baleen</b> in <b>baleen</b> <b>whales</b> occurred gradually, with earlier varieties having very little baleen, and their size is linked to baleen dependence (and subsequent increase in filter feeding).|$|R
50|$|<b>Baleen</b> <b>whales</b> (Mysticeti) {{owe their}} name to their <b>baleen.</b> Toothed <b>whales</b> (Odontoceti), {{which include the}} {{dolphins}} and porpoises, have conical teeth or spade-shaped teeth and can perceive their environment through biosonar.|$|R
25|$|Forty-six {{marine mammals}} from the order Cetacea {{are found in}} Australian coastal waters. Since the {{majority}} of these species have global distribution, some authors do not consider them to be Australian species. There are nine species of <b>baleen</b> <b>whale</b> present, including the humpback whale. There are 37 species of toothed whale, which include all six genera of the family Ziphiidae, and 21 species of oceanic dolphin, including the Australian snubfin dolphin, a species first described in 2005. Some oceanic dolphins, such as the orca, can be found in all waters around the continent; others, such as the Irrawaddy dolphin, are confined to the warm northern waters. The dugong is an endangered marine species that inhabits the waters of north-eastern and north-western Australia, particularly the Torres Strait. It can grow up to 3m long and weigh as much as 400kg. The dugong is the only herbivorous marine mammal in Australia, feeding on sea grass in coastal areas. The destruction of sea grass beds is a threat to the survival of this species. Eleven species of sealfamily Pinnipedialive off the southern coast.|$|E
500|$|The {{sei whale}} ( [...] or [...] ) (Balaenoptera borealis) is a <b>baleen</b> <b>whale,</b> the third-largest rorqual after the blue whale and the fin whale. [...] It inhabits most oceans and {{adjoining}} seas, and prefers deep offshore waters. It avoids polar and tropical waters and semienclosed bodies of water. The sei whale migrates annually from cool and subpolar waters in summer to winter in temperate and subtropical waters, with a lifespan of 70 years.|$|E
500|$|The {{humpback}} whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is {{a species of}} <b>baleen</b> <b>whale.</b> One of the larger rorqual species, adults range in length from [...] and weigh about [...] The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with long pectoral fins and a knobbly head. It is known for breaching and other distinctive surface behaviors, making it popular with whale watchers. Males produce a complex song lasting 10 to 20 minutes, which they repeat {{for hours at a}} time. Its purpose is not clear, though it may have a role in mating.|$|E
5|$|<b>Baleen</b> <b>whales</b> {{have two}} {{flippers}} on the front, near the head. Like all mammals, <b>baleen</b> <b>whales</b> breathe air and must surface periodically to do so. Their nostrils, or blowholes, are {{situated at the}} top of the cranium. <b>Baleen</b> <b>whales</b> have two blowholes, as opposed to toothed whales which have one. These paired blowholes are longitudinal slits that converge anteriorly and widen posteriorly, which causes a V-shaped blow. They are surrounded by a fleshy ridge that keeps water away while the whale breathes. The septum that separates the blowholes has two plugs attached to it, making the blowholes water-tight while the whale dives.|$|R
40|$|<b>Baleen</b> <b>whales</b> are an {{important}} group of predators on Antarctic krill in the Southern Ocean. During the CCAMLR 2000 Survey to estimate the biomass and distribution of Antarctic krill, International Whaling Commission observers carried out a visual line transect survey to estimate the number of <b>baleen</b> <b>whales</b> occurring in the survey area. This paper reviews techniques used to estimate krill consumption by <b>baleen</b> <b>whales</b> and in combination with estimates of whale abundance estimates of krill consumption are generated for the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. This survey estimates that the present populations of whales feeding in this region are likely to consume approximately 1. 6 million tonnes, but possibly up {{to as much as}} 2. 7 million tonnes of krill within the summer season. Although this only represents 4 - 6 % of the estimated krill biomass in the region (and probably less than this percentage of the total annual krill production), the depleted numbers of <b>baleen</b> <b>whales</b> resulting from past or current whaling activities should be taken into account when setting quotas for the commercial exploitation of krill {{if there is to be}} a recovery to pre-exploitation biomass levels of <b>baleen</b> <b>whales...</b>|$|R
25|$|Krill {{are also}} the main prey of <b>baleen</b> <b>whales,</b> {{including}} the blue whale.|$|R
500|$|One {{particular}} specimen – {{the remains}} of a [...] long prehistoric <b>baleen</b> <b>whale</b> (of an unknown Miocene taxon) – provided the first opportunity to quantitatively analyze its attack behavior. Unlike great whites which target the underbelly of their prey, megalodon probably targeted the heart and lungs, with their thick teeth adapted for biting through tough bone, as indicated by bite marks inflicted to the rib cage and other tough bony areas on whale remains. Furthermore, attack patterns could differ for prey of different sizes. Fossil remains of some small cetaceans, for example cetotheres, suggest that they were rammed with great force from below before being killed and eaten, based on compression fractures.|$|E
500|$|Fucaia buelli is the {{earliest}} mysticete, {{dating back to}} 33 million years ago (mya). Measuring only , it is the smallest <b>baleen</b> <b>whale</b> discovered. It is only known from its teeth; they suggest a suction feeding behavior, much like that of beaked whales. Like other early toothed mysticetes, or [...] "archaeomysticetes", F. buelli had heterodont dentition. Archaeomysticetes from the Oligocene are the Mammalodontidae (Mammalodon and Janjucetus) from Australia. They were small with shortened rostra, and a primitive dental formula (...) [...] In baleen whales, enlarged mouths adapted for suction feeding evolved before specializations for bulk filter feeding. In the toothed Oligocene mammalodontid Janjucetus, the symphysis is short and the mouth enlarged, the rostrum is wide, and {{the edges of the}} maxillae are thin, indicating an adaptation for suction feeding. The aetiocetid Chonecetus still had teeth, but the presence of a groove on the interior side of each mandible indicates the symphysis was elastic, which would have enabled rotation of each mandible, an initial adaptation for bulk feeding like in modern mysticetes.|$|E
500|$|Mysticeti {{split from}} Odontoceti (toothed whales) 26 to 17 {{million years ago}} during the Eocene. Their {{evolutionary}} link to archaic toothed cetaceans (Archaeoceti) remained unknown until the extinct Janjucetus hunderi was discovered in the early 1990s in Victoria, Australia. Like a modern <b>baleen</b> <b>whale,</b> Janjucetus had baleen in its jaw and had very little biosonar capabilities. However, its jaw also contained teeth, with incisors and canines built for stabbing and molars and premolars built for tearing. These early mysticetes were exceedingly small compared to modern baleen whales, with species like Mammalodon measuring no greater than [...] It is thought that their size increased with their dependence on baleen. The discovery of Janjucetus {{and others like it}} suggests that baleen evolution went through several transitional phases. Species like Mammalodon colliveri had little to no baleen, while later species like Aetiocetus weltoni had both baleen and teeth, suggesting they had limited filter feeding capabilities; later genera like Cetotherium had no teeth in their mouth, meaning they were fully dependent on baleen and could only filter feed.|$|E

40|$|Each {{austral summer}} large <b>baleen</b> <b>whales</b> migrate into the Southern Ocean {{to feed on}} krill. The melting of sea ice leads to algal blooms which allow rapid growth and {{development}} of krill. In order to predict how <b>baleen</b> <b>whales</b> will respond to long-term changes in the physical environment, {{we need to understand}} the relationships between <b>baleen</b> <b>whales,</b> their prey and the physical environment. The spatial models in this thesis are based on visual observations by whale observers onboard ships in open waters. The model analyses suggest that Antarctic minke whales are more often found close to the sea ice edge, continental shelf and frontal systems. Estimates show higher numbers of minke whales in regions that experienced more sea ice melting during austral spring and summer. These findings strongly suggest that the amount of sea ice cover, and especially its seasonal change, affects populations of minke whales at the regional scale. For the Scotia Sea, different species of <b>baleen</b> <b>whales</b> may target different types of krill. Minke whales and humpback whales were more often found in waters inhabited by juvenile krill, while fin whales were more often found in deeper waters, inhabited by adult krill. Improved understanding of whale behaviour will help us to better predict how <b>baleen</b> <b>whales</b> will respond to environmental change. We hardly know how far away <b>baleen</b> <b>whales</b> can detect krill swarms and how they forage in a three-dimensional environment. Recent advances in infrared detection and acoustic research are promising techniques to remedy this knowledge gap. ...|$|R

500|$|Most {{rorquals}} mate in warm {{waters in}} winter {{to give birth}} almost a year later. A 7-to-11 month lactation period is normally followed by a year of rest before mating starts again. Adults normally start reproducing when 5–10 years old and reach their full length after 20–30 years. In the smallest rorqual, the minke whale, [...] calves are born after a 10-month pregnancy and weaning lasts until it has reached about [...] after 6–7 months. Unusual for a <b>baleen</b> <b>whale,</b> female minkes (and humpbacks) can become pregnant immediately after giving birth; in most species, there is a two-to-three-year calving period. In right whales, the calving interval is usually three years. They grow very rapidly during their first year, after which they hardly increase in size for several years. [...] They reach sexual maturity when [...] long. Baleen whales are K-strategists, meaning they raise one calf at a time, have a long life-expectancy, and a low infant mortality rate. Some 19th century harpoons found in harvested bowheads indicate this species can live more than 100 years. Baleen whales are promiscuous, with none showing pair bonds. They are polygynous, in that a male may mate {{with more than one}} female. The scars on male whales suggest they fight for the right to mate with females during breeding season, somewhat similar to lek mating.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gray whale}} (Eschrichtius robustus), {{also known as}} the grey whale, [...] gray back whale, Pacific gray whale, or California gray whale is a <b>baleen</b> <b>whale</b> that migrates between feeding and {{breeding}} grounds yearly. It reaches a length of , a weight of , and lives between 55 and 70 years. [...] The common name of the whale comes from the gray patches and white mottling on its dark skin. [...] Gray whales were once called devil fish because of their fighting behavior when hunted. [...] The gray whale is the sole living species in the genus Eschrichtius, which in turn is the sole living genus in the family Eschrichtiidae.

2500|$|The whale feeds {{mainly on}} benthic crustaceans, which it eats by turning {{on its side}} (usually the right, {{resulting}} in loss of eyesight in the right eye for many older animals) and scooping up sediments from the sea floor. This unique feeding selection makes gray whales {{one of the most}} strongly reliant on coastal waters among baleen whales. It is classified as a <b>baleen</b> <b>whale</b> and has baleen, or whalebone, which acts like a sieve, to capture small sea animals, including amphipods taken in along with sand, water and other material.
