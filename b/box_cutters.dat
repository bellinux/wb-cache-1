500|$|At 06:22 on September 11, 2001, {{the group}} checked {{out of the}} hotel and headed to Dulles airport. [...] At 07:15, Mihdhar and Moqed checked in at the American Airlines ticket counter and arrived at the {{passenger}} security checkpoint at 07:20. [...] Both men set off the metal detector and were put through secondary screening. [...] Security video footage later released shows that Moqed was wanded, but the screener did not identify what set off the alarm, and both Moqed and Mihdhar were able to proceed without further hindrance. [...] Mihdhar was also selected by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS), which involved extra screening of his luggage; however, because Mihdhar did not check any luggage, this had no effect. [...] By 07:50, Mihdhar and the other hijackers, carrying knives and <b>box</b> <b>cutters,</b> had made it through the airport security checkpoint and boarded Flight77 to Los Angeles. Mihdhar was seated in seat 12B, next to Moqed.|$|E
500|$|Two {{people on}} the {{aircraft}} made phone calls to contacts on the ground. At 09:12, flight attendant Renee May called her mother, Nancy May, in Las Vegas. During the call, which lasted nearly two minutes, May said her flight was being hijacked by six persons, and staff and passengers had been moved {{to the rear of}} the airplane. May asked her mother to contact American Airlines, which she and her husband promptly did; American Airlines was already aware of the hijacking. Between 09:16 and 09:26, passenger Barbara Olson called her husband, United States Solicitor General Theodore Olson, and reported that the airplane had been hijacked and that the assailants had <b>box</b> <b>cutters</b> and knives. She reported that the passengers, including the pilots, had been moved to the back of the cabin and that the hijackers were unaware of her call. A minute into the conversation, the call was cut off. Theodore Olson contacted the command center at the Department of Justice, and tried unsuccessfully to contact Attorney General John Ashcroft. About five minutes later, Barbara Olson called again, told her husband that the [...] "pilot" [...] (possibly Hanjour on the cabin intercom) had announced the flight was hijacked, and asked, [...] "What do I tell the pilot to do?" [...] Ted Olson asked her location and she reported the plane was flying low over a residential area. He told her of the attacks on the World Trade Center. Soon afterward, the call cut off again.|$|E
2500|$|The {{flight was}} {{scheduled}} to depart at 08:10, but ended up departing 10minutes late from GateD26 at Dulles. [...] The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to air traffic control occurred at 08:50:51. At 08:54, Flight77 began to deviate from its normal, assigned flight path and turned south, and then hijackers set the flight's autopilot heading for Washington, D.C. Passenger Barbara Olson called her husband, United States Solicitor General Theodore Olson, and reported that the plane had been hijacked and that the assailants had <b>box</b> <b>cutters</b> and knives. [...] At 09:37, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the west facade of the Pentagon, killing all 64 aboard (including the hijackers), along with 125 {{on the ground in}} the Pentagon. [...] In the recovery process at the Pentagon, remains of all five Flight77 hijackers were identified through a process of elimination, as not matching any DNA samples for the victims, and put into custody of the FBI.|$|E

Using the flight intercom, Hanjour announced the flight was hijacked. As Flight 77 was 5 miles (8.0km) west-southwest of the Pentagon, it made a 330-degree turn. At {{the end of the}} turn, it was descending through 2,200 feet (670 m), pointed toward the Pentagon and downtown Washington. Hanjour apparently advanced the throttles to maximum power and dove towards the Pentagon at a speed of over 850km/h. At 09:37:46, Hanjour crashed the Boeing 757 into the west facade of the Pentagon, killing all 64 aboard (including himself and the other hijackers), along with 125 {{on the ground in the}} Pentagon. [...] While level above the ground and seconds from the crash, the airplane's wings knocked over light poles and its right engine smashed into a power generator, creating a smoke trail seconds before smashing into the Pentagon.
