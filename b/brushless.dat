5|$|Each boiler powered a turbo generator, made by Parsons, Newcastle upon Tyne. These were three-cylinder {{reaction}} type {{steam turbines}} operating at 3,000rpm, generating 60MW of electricity. The stations used {{them because of}} a Statutory Order of the Ministry of Supply in November 1947 that all turbo alternators made for the home market could only be of 60MW at advanced steam conditions. Stella South had a total generating capacity of 300MW and Stella North originally 240MW (later recorded as only 224MW). The stations {{were the first to}} use silica removal beds in their turbines, a development which became standard within the CEGB's power stations for some time. In 1967, one of the sets at Stella South became the world's first in commercial operation to use <b>brushless</b> excitation. The set was modified by Parsons to use A.C. exciters and silicon diode rectifiers. The stations' switchgear was manufactured by A. Reyrolle & Company.|$|E
25|$|The term {{electronic}} commutator {{is usually}} associated with self-commutated <b>brushless</b> DC motor and switched reluctance motor applications.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of robots use electric motors, often brushed and <b>brushless</b> DC motors in portable robots or AC motors in industrial robots and CNC machines. These motors are often preferred in systems with lighter loads, and where the predominant form of motion is rotational.|$|E
25|$|The <b>brushless</b> wound-rotor {{synchronous}} doubly-fed (BWRSDF) {{machine is}} the only electric machine with a truly dual ported transformer circuit topology (i.e., both ports independently excited with no short-circuited port). The dual ported transformer circuit topology {{is known to be}} unstable and requires a multiphase slip-ring-brush assembly to propagate limited power to the rotor winding set. If a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during motoring or generating while simultaneously providing <b>brushless</b> power to the rotor winding set, the active current of the BWRSDF machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable. Torque bursts greater than eight times operating torque have been calculated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Brushless</b> motors {{typically}} use cylindrical {{designs in}} which all the flux is confined to the centre of the bore (such as k = 4 above, a six pole rotor) with the AC coils also contained within the bore. Such self-shielding motors designs are more efficient and produce higher torque than conventional motor designs.|$|E
25|$|Handheld 3-axis gimbals {{are used}} in {{stabilization}} systems designed to give the camera operator the independence of handheld shooting without camera vibration or shake. Powered by three <b>brushless</b> motors, the gimbals {{have the ability to}} keep the camera level on all axes as the camera operator moves the camera. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) responds to movement and utilizes its three separate motors to stabilize the camera.|$|E
25|$|Rectifier locomotives, {{which used}} AC power {{transmission}} and DC motors, were common, though DC commutators had problems both in starting and at low velocities. Today's advanced electric locomotives use <b>brushless</b> three-phase AC induction motors. These polyphase machines are powered from GTO-, IGCT- or IGBT-based inverters. The cost of electronic devices {{in a modern}} locomotive can be up to 50% {{of the cost of}} the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{electric}} machines used in hybrid vehicles are <b>brushless</b> DC motors (BLDC). Specifically, they are of a type called an interior permanent magnet (IPM) machine (or motor). These machines are wound similarly to the induction motors found in a typical home, but (for high efficiency) use very strong rare-earth magnets in the rotor. These magnets contain neodymium, iron and boron, and are therefore called Neodymium magnets.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} Westinghouse {{continued}} to pour money and engineering resources into {{the goal of}} building a completely integrated AC system, obtaining the Sawyer–Man lamp by buying Consolidated Electric Light, developing components such as an induction meter, and obtaining the rights to inventor Nikola Tesla's <b>brushless</b> AC induction motor along with patents for {{a new type of}} electric power distribution, polyphase alternating current. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent for his system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while.|$|E
25|$|The Black Shark torpedo offers {{fibre optic}} wire for {{increased}} bandwidth and signal processing ability compared to copper wire guided torpedo types. The sonar capability include non-doppler shifted target discrimination and multi-frequency capability that features advanced spatial and angular analysis abilities. The design {{goal for the}} torpedo was 300% improvement of passive acquisition and 200% active acquisition with its sonar system. The <b>brushless</b> motor design coupled with the aluminum-silver oxide (Al-AgO) battery gives the system a top speed 50+ knot, {{and a range of}} 50km, performance envelope. Like all other battery powered HWTs, the battery power system does not suffer the loss of performance of Otto fuel II types at greater depths since there is no exhaust to deal with at greater pressures. The result is a 150% improvement in speed and 200% in torpedo endurance.|$|E
500|$|In 2016, {{after almost}} 15 years of {{incremental}} improvements to Barracuda, the team {{designed and built}} a new AUV, Marlin. The hull and frame were expanded, and an all-new electronics and pneumatics package was developed. The software was also completely rewritten in a more modular fashion, to allow for easier testing of separate subsystems. The added maneuverability of eight new <b>brushless</b> thrusters and the processing power of a desktop computer motherboard gives the team lots of overhead for later developments and improvements ...|$|E

2500|$|The Insight {{uses the}} first {{generation}} of Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid technology. (The next generation, used in the Honda Civic Hybrid, is much more space-efficient.) The Insight's electric assist is an ultrathin 60mm (about 2.4inches) <b>brushless</b> 10-kW electric motor located on the crankshaft. Located behind the seats are a series of commercial grade [...] "D" [...] sized NiMH batteries wired to provide a nominal 144 V DC. During heavy acceleration, the NiMH batteries drive the electric motor, providing additional power; during deceleration, the motor acts as a generator and recharges the batteries using a process called regenerative braking. A computer control module regulates how much power comes from the internal combustion engine, and how much from the electric motor; in the CVT variant, it also finds the optimal gear ratio. The digital displays on the dashboard display fuel consumption instantaneously. On the manual transmission up and down arrows suggest when to shift gears. Dashboard gauges monitor the current battery status, instantaneous fuel consumption, and mode of the electric motor — standby, engine assist or charging the batteries.

50|$|<b>Brushless</b> motors fulfill many {{functions}} originally {{performed by}} brushed DC motors, but cost and control complexity prevents <b>brushless</b> motors from replacing brushed motors {{completely in the}} lowest-cost areas. Nevertheless, <b>brushless</b> motors have come to dominate many applications, particularly devices such as computer hard drives and CD/DVD players. Small cooling fans in electronic equipment are powered exclusively by <b>brushless</b> motors. They {{can be found in}} cordless power tools where the increased efficiency of the motor leads to longer periods of use before the battery needs to be charged. Low speed, low power <b>brushless</b> motors are used in direct-drive turntables for gramophone records.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brushless</b> motors {{are used}} in {{industrial}} positioning and actuation applications.

50|$|There is a {{trend in}} the HVAC and {{refrigeration}} industries to use <b>brushless</b> motors instead of various types of AC motors. The most significant reason {{to switch to a}} <b>brushless</b> motor is the dramatic reduction in power required to operate them versus a typical AC motor. While shaded-pole and permanent split capacitor motors once dominated as the motor of fan, many fans are now run using a <b>brushless</b> motor. Some fans use <b>brushless</b> motors also in order to increase overall system efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|ESC {{systems for}} brushed motors are very {{different}} by design; as a result brushed ESC's are not compatible with <b>brushless</b> motors. <b>Brushless</b> ESC systems basically create a tri-phase AC power output of limited voltage from an onboard DC power input, to run <b>brushless</b> motors by sending a sequence of AC signals generated from the ESC's circuitry, employing a very low impedance for rotation. <b>Brushless</b> motors, otherwise called outrunners or inrunners depending on their physical configuration, have become very popular with [...] "electroflight" [...] radio-control aeromodeling hobbyists because of their efficiency, power, longevity and light weight in comparison to traditional brushed motors. <b>Brushless</b> AC motor controllers are {{much more complicated than}} brushed motor controllers.|$|E

5000|$|SIEG is {{the first}} Chinese {{manufacturer}} to have equipped their small lathe and mill products with <b>brushless</b> motors. This <b>brushless</b> motor is controlled by a programmed control board that automatically adjust the torque ouput, {{in order to maximize}} it from low to high RPM range; it is quieter too. All SIEG's [...] "Super" [...] variants are equipped with the <b>brushless</b> thechonology, except the SX1.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brushless</b> motors {{are found}} in {{electric}} vehicles, hybrid vehicles and personal transporters, which are in essence AC synchronous motors with permanent magnet rotors. Some electric bicycles use <b>brushless</b> motors that are sometimes built into the wheel hub itself, with the stator fixed solidly to the axle and the magnets attached to and rotating with the wheel. Most electrically powered RC models use <b>brushless</b> motors because of their high efficiency.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brushless</b> motors {{are capable}} of {{producing}} more torque and have a faster peak rotational speed compared to nitro- or gasoline-powered engines. Nitro engines climax to peak at around 46,800 RPM and 2.95 HP, while a smaller <b>brushless</b> motor has instantaneous maximum torque at start, and, when tapering off, can reach 50,000 RPM and 5 HP. Larger <b>brushless</b> RC motors can reach upwards of 14 hp and 28,000 RPM to power 1/5th scale models.|$|E
50|$|There are now {{two main}} types of heavy duty alternators {{produced}} by Remy International.

The <b>brushless</b> type design contains fewer moving parts making the unit more durable and increasing overall life {{in addition to a}}n increase in efficiency. Examples of current <b>brushless</b> products include 36SI, 40SI, and 55SI. Current examples of brush style alternators include 24SI and 28SI.|$|E
50|$|Released in {{late spring}} 2009, the E-Revo VXL 1/16 is {{essentially}} a scaled down version of the larger 1/10 scale E-Revo. The body, wheels, tires, suspension and drive components are all nearly identical in design to the 1/10 scale E-Revo, just scaled down. It {{is powered by a}} Velineon 380 4000kv <b>brushless</b> motor and a VXL-3m <b>brushless</b> ESC, both scaled down versions of the Velineon 3500kv <b>brushless</b> motor and VXL-3s <b>brushless</b> ESC used in Traxxas' 1/10 scale <b>brushless</b> vehicles. Some of the inevitable sacrifices inherent with the smaller scale include the lack of the optional two-speed transmission, many rubber sealed components, and dual steering servos offered on the 1/10 scale version. Claimed top speeds depend on which battery packs are used. One 7.2 v NiMH pack will reach 30 mph. Two 7.2 v NiMH packs will reach 50 mph. One 3s 11.1v lipo pack will reach 50 mph.|$|E

5000|$|There are two {{distinct}} types of controllers designed to match either a brushed motor or <b>brushless</b> motor. <b>Brushless</b> motors {{are becoming more}} common {{as the cost of}} controllers continues to decrease. (See the page on DC motors which covers the differences between these two types.) ...|$|E
50|$|The type {{of motor}} is not {{critical}} to a servomotor and different types may be used. At the simplest, brushed permanent magnet DC motors are used, owing to their simplicity and low cost. Small industrial servomotors are typically electronically commutated <b>brushless</b> motors. For large industrial servomotors, AC induction motors are typically used, often with {{variable frequency drives}} to allow control of their speed. For ultimate performance in a compact package, <b>brushless</b> AC motors with permanent magnet fields are used, effectively large versions of <b>Brushless</b> DC electric motors.|$|E
50|$|To {{transmit}} {{this power}} to the rail Brush utilised a <b>brushless</b> salient pole three phase alternator connected to a rectifying circuit of 84 silicon diodes producing ~2,500 kW of power for electric traction from the diesel engine. An auxiliary alternator, also <b>brushless</b> and producing three phase electrical power gave ~500 kW for electrical train heating, and also supplied power to electrical fans etc. in the locomotive. The rotors for both alternators were electrically energised by DC produced by the rectified output of <b>brushless</b> alternators.|$|E
