25|$|By 1954, all U.S. {{networks}} had regained {{control of}} their programming, with higher advertising revenues: ABC's revenue increased by 67% (earning $26 million), NBC's went up by 30% ($100 million) and CBS's rose by 44% ($117 million). However that year, ABC had only 14 primary affiliates compared to the 74 that carried the majority of CBS programs and the 71 that were primarily affiliated with NBC. Most markets outside the largest ones were not large enough to support three full-time network affiliates. In some markets that were large enough for a third full-time affiliate, the only available commercial allocation was on the less-desirable UHF band. Until the All-Channel Receiver Act (passed by Congress in 1961) mandated the inclusion of UHF tuning, most viewers needed to purchase a converter to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> UHF stations, and the signal quality was marginal at best even with a converter. Additionally, during the analog television era, UHF stations were not adequately receivable in rugged terrain. These factors made many prospective station owners skittish about investing in a UHF station, especially one that {{would have had to}} take on an affiliation with a weaker network.|$|E
500|$|Each cabin {{consisted}} of a room, fireplace, and sleeping loft. The arrangement of the quarters is distinctive: there were originally 32 cabins {{laid out in a}} semicircular arc interrupted by the main thoroughfare to the plantation, Palmetto Avenue. [...] This formation is unique in plantations in the antebellum U.S. The historian Daniel Stowell surmises that it may have given slave families a modicum of privacy, although he also suggests overseers and slave managers may have arranged the quarters to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> all the slaves from the owner's house at the same time. Author Daniel Schafer, however, suggests that Anna Jai may have been responsible for this layout. West African villages were commonly constructed in a circular pattern with the king or ruling family living in the center.|$|E

500|$|The PTC {{called on}} the United States Department of Justice and the Judiciary Committees of both houses of Congress to {{investigate}} whether MTV violated child pornography laws in casting teenaged actors in Skins, a remake of the British TV series of the same name. MTV rated Skins [...] "TV-MA", meaning the show is not suitable for audiences under 17. The Los Angeles Times responded in an editorial: [...] "...looking for government remedies is ineffective and unwise; we suspect the network's editors are smart enough to skirt prosecution. The Federal Communications Commission doesn't regulate the content of cable networks, {{and even if it}} did, a crackdown on shows like [...] "Skins" [...] would be a bad idea, because adults should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> whatever they like on cable and federal attempts to protect kids from adult programming have never been successful." ...|$|E

[...] Although he lived only 15 minutes away, Davis {{arrived at the}} venue {{more than an hour}} late. When the band walked out onstage, he followed with his back turned to the audience, casually strolling onstage while the other musicians were setting up. Davis immediately began to play, and the band responded by playing a dense rhythm in unison. Saxophonist Dave Liebman, writing in the 1997 US reissue liner notes for Dark Magus, recalled the start of the show: [...] "It is his whim [...]. That's the thing!... Miles can do that and have three thousand musicians follow him. Right? So what I learned in that respect from Miles was to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> him and be on his case".|$|E

The following day, Messi responded by scoring his third hat-trick in his four games, his 21st La Liga hat-trick in total.
