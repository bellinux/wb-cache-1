Laboratory perimeters (hemoglobin and platelet count), were measured at baseline, after initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, and on intensive care unit admission. Lowest values recorded were noted. Blood administration was controlled by study-specific protocol orders, (transfusion for hemoglobin < 8 mg%). Patient demographic data were retrieved from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database. Blood product administration was recorded during hospital admission, and chest tube drainage as total output collected from operating room to discontinuation. Continuous variables were tested with a Wilcoxin rank test, and categoric variables with X 2 and Fisher's exact tests. ResultsHematocrit, equivalent at baseline, was higher in minimized circuit cohort at lowest point during cariopulmonary bypass (31. 5 % ± 3. 9 % vs. 25. 5 % ± 3. 7 %), after protamine (31. 6 % ± 3. 9 % vs 29. 2 % ± 3. 7 %), and on intensive care unit arrival (35. 2 % ± 4. 1 % vs 31. 8 % ± 3. 5 %, P <. 001). Similarly, platelet count was higher in minimized circuit group on intensive care unit arrival, as was lowest platelet count recorded (170 × 103 ± 48 cells/mm 3 vs 107 × 103 ± 28 cells/mm 3, P <. 0001). Time to extubation was shorter in minimized circuit group (848 ± 737 minutes vs. 526 ± 282 minutes, (P <. 01), and total chest tube drainage was lower (1124 ± 647 mL vs. 506 ± 214 mL, P <. 01). Fewer red blood cells (148 vs 19 units) were given in minimized circuit group (P <. 0001).

Their area, energy consumption, and performance have a tendency to be proportional to the number of cores. It is better to utilize in-order (IO) execution for better area/energy efficiency. However, expanding two-way IO to three-way IO offers very little improvement, since data dependency limits the effectiveness. In addition, if the core is changed from IO to out-of-order (OoO) execution to improve Instruction Per Cycle(IPC), area and energy consumption increases significantly. The combination of IO execution and Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU) cascading is an effective solution to alleviate this problem. However, ALU cascading is implemented by complex <b>bypass</b> <b>circuits</b> because it requires a connection between all outputs and all inputs of all ALUs.

This study evaluates the efficacy of preoperative methylprednisolone administration in limiting this injury in neonates and compares the effect of giving methylprednisolone 8 hours before an operation to the common practice of adding methylprednisolone to the cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> <b>circuit</b> prime. Methods: A control group of neonatal pigs (control; n = 6) received no preoperative medication. One experimental group (n = 6) received methylprednisolone sodium succinate (30 mg/kg) both 8 and 1. 5 hours before the operation. A second experimental group received no preoperative treatment, but methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) {{was added to the}} cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> <b>circuit</b> prime. All animals underwent cardiopulmonary bypass and 45 minutes of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Hemodynamic and pulmonary function data were acquired before cardiopulmonary bypass and at 30 and 60 minutes after bypass. Results: In the control group, pulmonary compliance, alveolar-arterial gradient, and pulmonary vascular resistance were significantly impaired after bypass (P <. 01 for each by analysis of variance). In the group that received methylprednisolone, compliance (P =. 02), alveolar-arterial gradient (P =. 0003), pulmonary vascular resistance (P =. 007), and extracellular fluid accumulation (P =. 003) were significantly better after bypass when compared with the control group. Results for the group that received no preoperative treatment fell between the control group and the group that received methylprednisolone. Conclusions: When given 8 hours and immediately before the operation, methylprednisolone improves pulmonary compliance after bypass, alveolar-arterial gradient, and pulmonary vascular resistance compared with no treatment. The addition of methylprednisolone to the cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> <b>circuit</b> prime is beneficial but inferior to preoperative administration.

We comparatively examined the respective contribution of cardiotomy suction and open venous reservoirs to perioperative activation in coagulofibrinolysis and inflammation systems, with identical conditions of priming volume and anticoagulation. MethodsA total of 75 consecutive coronary artery bypass grafting procedures were performed using 1 of the following 3 cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> <b>circuits</b> under identical conditions of priming volumes, heparin coating, and protocols of anticoagulation and transfusion, as follows: a circuit with an open venous reservoir and cardiotomy suction (open group, n =  25), a circuit with an open venous reservoir without cardiotomy suction (nonsuction group, n =  25), or a circuit without either (closed group, n =  25). Blood samples were collected at 8 points up to the first postoperative morning. ResultsThe thrombin-antithrombin III complex, fibrinogen degeneration products, D-dimer, plasmin-α 2 plasmin inhibitor complex, and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 levels were significantly greater in the open group than those in the other 2 groups (P < . 0001, for all markers). The C 3 a and interleukin- 6 levels were similar among all the groups. The incidences of perioperative transfusion and postoperative bleeding were increased and the early graft patency rate of saphenous veins was lower in the open group than those in the other 2 groups.

40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies show}} that (1) {{hypoxemia}} depletes immature myocardium of amino acid substrates and their replenishment improves ischemic tolerance, (2) reoxygenation on cardiopulmonary bypass causes oxygen-mediated damage without added ischemia, and (3) this damage {{may be related to}} the nitric oxide–L-arginine pathway that is affected by amino acid metabolism. This study tests the hypothesis that priming the cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> <b>circuit</b> with glutamate and aspartate limits reoxygenation damage. Of 22 immature Duroc-Yorkshire piglets (< 3 weeks old), five were observed over a 5 -hour period (control), and five others underwent 30 minutes of CPB without hypoxemia (cardiopulmonary bypass control). Twelve others became hypoxemic by reducing ventilator inspired oxygen fraction to 6 % to 7 % (oxygen tension about 25 mm Hg) before reoxygenation on cardiopulmonary bypass for 30 minutes. Of these five were untreated (no treatment), and the cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> <b>circuit</b> was primed with 5 mmol/L glutamate and aspartate in seven others (treatment). Left ventricular function before and after bypass was measured by inscribing pressure-volume loops (end-systolic elastance). Myocardial conjugated diene levels were measured to detect lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant reserve capacity was tested by incubating cardiac muscle with the oxidant t-butylhydroperoxide to determine the susceptibility to subsequent oxidant injury. CPB (no hypoxemia) allowed complete functional recovery without changing conjugated dienes and antioxidant reserve capacity, whereas reoxygenation injury developed in untreated hearts. This was characterized by reduced contractility (elastance end-systolic recovered only 37 % ± 8 %*), increased conjugated diene levels (1. 3 ± 0. 1 vs 0. 7 ± 0. 1 *), and decreased antioxidant reserve capacity (910 ± 59 vs 471 ± 30 malondialdehyde nmol/g protein at 2 mmol/L t-butylhydroperoxide*). In contrast, priming the cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> <b>circuit</b> with glutamate and aspartate resulted in significantly better left ventricular functional recovery (75 % ± 8 % vs 37 % ± 8 %*), minimal conjugated diene production (0. 8 ± 0. 1 vs 1. 3 ± 0. 1 *), and improved antioxidant reserve capacity (726 ± 27 vs 910 ± 59 malondialdehyde nmol/g protein*) (*p < 0. 05 vs cardiopulmonary bypass control). We conclude that reoxygenation of immature hypoxemic piglets by the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass causes myocardial dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and reduced tolerance to oxidant stress, which may increase vulnerability to subsequent ischemia (i. e., aortic crossclamping). These data suggest that supplementing the prime of cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> <b>circuit</b> with glutamate and aspartate may reduce these deleterious consequences of reoxygenation.

A marked rise in neutrophil CD 11 b/CD 18 expression, simultaneous loss of L-selectin expression, and a progressive accumulation of plasma elastase–α 1 -antitrypsin occurred and were not affected by soluble complement receptor. However, generation of interleukin- 8 in the circuits was inhibited (p < 0. 05) by pretreatment with soluble complement receptor. These data suggest that changes in neutrophil activation seen during cardiopulmonary bypass may not be induced directly by anaphylatoxin generation.
