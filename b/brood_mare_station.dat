40|$|Serious horse {{producers}} {{are concerned about}} their mares 2 ̆ 7 reproductive performance and ability to mother strong, healthy foals. Economic survival often hinges on mares foaling early in the year, rebreeding quickly and nursing a growing foal that develops soundly. While achieving these goals in a herd of <b>brood</b> <b>mares</b> is dependent upon many factors, nutritional well-being is one important part of an effective <b>brood</b> <b>mare</b> operation. <b>Brood</b> <b>mares</b> have specific nutritional requirments that differ from other classes of horses. There are differences both {{in the amount of}} feed mares need and in the nutrient concentration needed in taht feed. Therefore, the <b>brood</b> <b>mare</b> fits into a class of her own...|$|R

40|$|A disease {{outbreak}} investigation {{was conducted in}} western Queensland to investigate a rare suspected outbreak of pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) toxicosis in horses. Thirty five of 132 horses depastured on five properties on the Mitchell grass plains of western Queensland died {{in the first six}} months of 2010. Clinical–pathological findings were consistent with PA toxicosis. A local variety of Crotalaria medicaginea was the only hepatotoxic plant found growing on affected properties. Pathology reports and departure and arrival dates of two <b>brood</b> <b>mares</b> provided evidence of a pre wet season exposure period. All five affected properties experienced a very dry spring and early summer preceded by a large summer wet season. The outbreak was characterised as a point epidemic with a sudden peak of deaths in March followed by mortalities steadily declining until the end of June. The estimated morbidity (serum IGG > 50 IU/L) rate was 76 %. Average crude mortality was 27 % but higher in young horses (67 %) and <b>brood</b> <b>mares</b> (44 %). Logistic regression analysis showed that young horses and <b>brood</b> <b>mares</b> and those grazing denuded pastures in December were most strongly associated with dying whereas those fed hay and/or grain based supplements were less likely to die. This is the first detailed study of an outbreak of PA toxicosis in central western Queensland and the first to provide evidence that environmental determinants were associated with mortality, that the critical exposure period was towards the end of the dry season, that supplementary feeding is protective and that denuded pastures and the horses physiological protein requirement are risk factors...|$|R
