500|$|The Allman Brothers Band have {{generally}} been {{considered one of the}} pioneering bands in Southern rock, although the group distanced themselves from the term. Guitarist Dickey Betts was most vocal about this classification, which he considered unfair: [...] "I think it's limiting. I'd rather just be known as a progressive rock band from the South. I'm damned proud of who I am and where I'm from, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> the term 'Southern rock.' I think calling us that pigeonholed us and forced people to expect certain types of music from us that I don’t think are fair." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court Harlan Fiske Stone {{called the}} Nuremberg trials a fraud. [...] "(Chief U.S. prosecutor) Jackson is away {{conducting}} his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg," [...] he wrote. [...] "I don't mind {{what he does}} to the Nazis, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> to see the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law. This {{is a little too}} sanctimonious a fraud to meet my old-fashioned ideas." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “I {{hate that}} I got into Kurt {{there at the}} end racing to the line,’’ Logano said. “I had a run to turn up {{underneath}} him and when you do that, the cars get free and then I was there and he tried to catch it and I was there again. It is a product of this racing, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> that it happened. The last thing I want to do is hit someone like that. Unfortunately, it happened.’’ ...|$|E
60|$|And {{the friend}} that I had loved came towards me, {{and we walked}} {{together}} with our hands clasped. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, God only knows!" [...] exclaimed Flo, {{throwing}} up her gloved hands. [...] "I never could understand. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> what the war did to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{wanted me}} to marry Lord Nidderdale and Lord Grasslough, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> them both. <b>I</b> think {{he wants me to}} marry Lord Nidderdale again now. He hasn't said so, but mamma tells me. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> never will,--never!' ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{even at the}} time the Nuremberg trials {{appeared}} to be victor's justice, revenge papered over with legal simulcra. US Supreme Court Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone remarked that his colleague Justice Jackson acting as Nuremberg Chief prosecutor was [...] "conducting his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg. I don't mind what he does to the Nazis, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> to see the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law. This is a little too sanctimonious a fraud to meet my old-fashioned ideas." ...|$|E
2500|$|The storyline {{eventually}} {{reached its}} climax in October 2007. Steven's games were uncovered, {{and during the}} confrontation that followed, Steven threatened to kill himself, but accidentally shot Ian's wife Jane (Laurie Brett) and a resulting emergency hysterectomy meant that Jane could no longer have children of her own. The storyline {{has been described by}} The Guardian journalist, Stephen Armstrong, as having [...] "a whiff of Brontë about it", which producer Diederick Santer agreed with. Santer added, [...] "It's a classic madwoman in the attic story, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> those articles where someone who works in popular television says what they do is like Dickens. It's about the balance. That story works because it has an old character whom the audience love - Ian Beale - as well as new characters who have an appeal for teenagers fresh to the show. Soap audiences like continuity. They dip in and out and if they haven't watched for a few weeks, then tune in to find no one they recognise, it can be disconcerting." ...|$|E
60|$|JOY. [Through her teeth.] I hate him. I didn't mean to listen, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> him.|$|E
5000|$|Nobody {{bought that}} record... I liked making music, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> the {{performing}} part of it. I think there's a reason most animators are hidden behind giant curtains. They're {{not meant for}} the spotlight." ...|$|R
50|$|Stone: <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> conservatives <b>but</b> <b>I</b> really fucking <b>hate</b> liberals.|$|R
6000|$|I was {{too much}} flattered to make an {{exposure}} and throw the merchandise on the angel's hands. I was hot, vexed, confused, but still happy; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> the other boys for taking such an absorbing interest in the proceedings. I wished they were in Jericho. I felt exquisitely mean when I said cheerfully: ...|$|R
60|$|Rose. I cannot on {{the sudden}} tell; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> him worse than foul weather without a coach.|$|E
60|$|JOY. I overheard. I don't care, I listened. I {{would n't}} {{if it had}} been anybody else, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then she's {{worse than}} I thought. I don't mind {{them so much}} when they are merry <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> them when they are sentimental.' ...|$|E
60|$|DEARTH. I hope not. I {{should want}} to {{strangle}} him, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't <b>hate</b> him.|$|R
60|$|No, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> do <b>hate</b> {{doing it}} myself. And Ronny {{was able to}} imitate my handwriting.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his review}} for the Daily Mail, Quentin Letts stated, [...] "Call me a miserable old monk <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> Sister Act. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> its artistic laziness, its predictability, its incuriosity, its idea that disco is divine and that spirituality {{can never be}} found in {{discreet}} and dignified worship [...] [...] [...] I know I may be taking it too seriously <b>but</b> <b>I</b> found myself recoiling sharply from this story's saccharine values and its bullying gaiety. The thing is as shallow as the Aral Sea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Apropos of which, let {{me explain}} my visit. I was told to {{telephone}} to you, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> a conversation down a tube, don't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{know there}} would be a great risk. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> to think of going to a Siberian prison, or aboard a Russian prison ship." ...|$|E
6000|$|He was {{struggling}} {{as if with}} the pangs of death, but he said, [...] "'Tis childish, I know, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> {{to say good-bye to}} it all." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{found out}} many things about myself and {{humanity}} in those weeks of effort behind Mordet Island. I understand now {{the heart of}} the sweater, of the harsh employer, of the nigger-driver. I had brought these men into a danger they didn't understand, I was fiercely resolved to overcome their opposition and bend and use them for my purpose, and <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> the men. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> all humanity during the time that the quap was near me.|$|R
5000|$|Hubbard {{was once}} quoted as saying, [...] "I’m not a racist, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> just <b>hate</b> those black bastards." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{suppose he}} is," [...] Macheson repeated. [...] "I don't {{care for him}} very much, Dick; I suppose I'm an evil-minded person, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> leaving them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tough luck," [...] said Thomas. [...] "A man {{alone can}} pull through all right. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> {{to see the}} women and kids get the worst of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] he said pleasantly. [...] "It's a queer fancy of mine, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> dining alone. Waiter, {{bring some}} more soup at once. This gentleman will dine with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Homicide {{was what}} that Mariana had perpetrated. He was looking well enough, {{but he had}} on a white collar and shoes, and you could tell in a minute that he'd speak polite and pay taxes and stick his little finger out while drinking, just like a sheep man or a citizen. Great skyrockets! <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> to see Perry all {{corrupted}} and Willie-ized like that.|$|R
6000|$|The {{mention of}} money cast a chill upon their talk; and Mrs. Lander said gloomily, [...] "I don't know as I ca'e {{so much for}} that will Mr. Milray made for me, after all. I did want to say ten {{thousand}} apiece for Mr. Landa's relations; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> to befo'e him; I'd told the whole kit of 'em so much about you, and I knew what they would think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I--I--I--no--no. I know I am very foolish--ungrateful. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> do <b>hate</b> you,' he said, with {{a sudden}} impulse, 'and I'll tell you why.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been {{wild about}} that fellow. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> him, too," [...] she said, with {{flashing}} spirit. [...] "And I {{want to go}} on hating him. So don't tell me any more." ...|$|E
60|$|HARRY. You've {{been most}} awfully decent about it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> {{to think of}} your {{spending}} day after day entirely by yourself. It can't {{be good for you}} to be so much alone.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was all right," [...] {{replied the}} gambler. [...] "I didn't {{mean that it}} was crooked. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> to see a good man lose his money as you were sure to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She slapped me," [...] he replied. [...] "An' {{then she}} says, I did like you best, <b>but</b> NOW <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> you!' An' she {{slammed the door}} in my face." ...|$|R
60|$|Melissa {{had turned}} her back on me and was sitting with her elbows propped up on her knees, looking gloomily out to sea. I was afraid I couldn't coax her into marrying Isaac. As for me, I hadn't any real {{objection}} to marrying him, after all, for if he was short of romance he was good-natured and has a fat bank account; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> to be driven into it that way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'll see. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> do <b>hate</b> {{freckles}} and big red hands, {{and round}} shoulders. She can't help it, <b>I</b> suppose, <b>but</b> ugly things fret me." ...|$|R
