40|$|Abstract. Software {{has become}} an {{essential}} component in many service systems, either as an enabler of a more efficient and cost-effective interaction or {{becoming part of the}} value co-creation activities themselves. However, software processes that result in the development or evolution of service-support systems do not provide explicit elements or considerations that link with the models and design processes of the services they are intended to support. Since the arrangement, change and improvement of services determine how supporting software should be developed and changed, {{there is a need to}} <b>bridge</b> <b>software</b> process models and service design models. In a radical position this would entail that the software process itself becomes a service for the design and evolution of services. This paper conceptualizes a preliminary approach for that purpose. ...|$|E

40|$|Myogram is an 8 channel {{sonification}} of muscular corporeal {{states by}} Atau Tanaka. By placing {{a ring of}} four electrode channels on each forearm of the performer, we hear the neuron impulses of muscle exertion from the shoulder through the hand. The multiple electrodes on the forearm focus on specific muscle groups from flexor to extensor, the carpi ulnaris, brachioreadialis, to palmaris longus. This reports on voluntary muscle activity causing wrist rotation and finger movement. These rings of sensors on each arm, left and right, are mapped to dual quadraphonic speaker spaces, a ring on the left wall and a ring on the right wall. First a direct audification of motor unit action potentials is heard as spikes. This stochastic pulse train reflects performer limb activity. The pure spikes then feed resonators and filters, resulting in a sonification by sound synthesis that responds to the musician’s gestural language.
