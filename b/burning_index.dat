40|$|Multiple mapping {{conditioning}} (MMC) explicitly {{includes a}} link between the physical velocity and the conditioning variable. The usual method of obtaining values for the conditional physical velocity is to define the value of the conditioning variable and use a model for the velocity. In contrast to the conditional moment closure (CMC) approach, the conditioning variable is not a real quantity and hence provides greater flexibility in its definition. The hybrid binomial Langevin–MMC model has the advantage of naturally incorporating velocity–scalar interactions through the binomial Langevin model and the joint probability density function (PDF) is here used to define a reference variable for the MMC part of the model. The current approach has the advantage that difficulties encountered with the binomial Langevin model in modeling scalars with non-elementary bounds are removed. The formulation of the closure leads to locality in scalar space and permits the use of simple approaches for transport in the reference space. The evaluation of the technique is here extended to a jet flame with moderately-high levels of extinction (Sandia Flame E). A direct comparison with experimental data and the EMST (Euclidean minimum spanning tree) model for temperature, species concentrations and <b>burning</b> <b>indexes</b> suggests that the approach performs well. ...|$|R

It has been scaled so that the value, divided by 10, predicts the flame length at the head of a fire. For example, an index of 75 would predict a flame length of 7.5 ft. It is a function of the Spread Component and the Energy Release Component and has moderate variability.

Moreover, the burning practice {{was a reason}} of losing carbon content from crop land to the atmosphere. This study focuses on estimation of carbon content loss to the atmosphere through open burning of rice straw and suggests alternative rice straw management practices to reduce field open burning in Thailand. Field experiments were conducted to collect samples of rice straw to quantify residue to product ratio (RPR) and analyze their carbon content by elemental analysis. Ash samples were also collected to analyze their carbon content. Carbon losses to the atmosphere through field burning were then estimated. To better understand traditional practices of open burning in Thailand, statistics related to seasonal rice production/harvesting were also investigated. Finally, economic and environmental benefits associated to alternative rice straw management options were considered and discussed against traditional open <b>burning</b> practices. <b>Index</b> Terms—Rice straw, residue to product ratio, field open burning, carbon released.

Wildfires and wildland fire use fires occurred primarily in the summer; consequently, the mean 95 th percentile burning indexes, flame lengths and fireline intensities were higher. The value of these attributes for wildland fire use fires were slightly higher than for wildfires because wildland fire use fires were allowed to burn over long durations, which often included periods of extreme weather.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} novel {{technique}} for melting and burning solid materials including the simulation {{of the resulting}} liquid and gas. The solid is simulated with traditional mesh-based techniques (triangles or tetrahedra) which enable robust handling of both deformable and rigid objects, collision and self-collision, rolling, friction, stacking, etc. The subsequently created liquid or gas is simulated with modern grid-based techniques including vorticity confinement and the particle level set method. The main advantage of our method is that {{state of the art}} techniques are used for both the solid and the fluid without compromising simulation quality when coupling them together or converting one into the other. For example, we avoid modeling solids as Eulerian grid-based fluids with high viscosity or viscoelasticity, which would preclude the handling of thin shells, self-collision, rolling, etc. Thus, our method allows one to achieve new effects while still using their favorite algorithms (and implementations) for simulating both solids and fluids, whereas other coupling algorithms require major algorithm and implementation overhauls and still fail to produce rich coupling effects (e. g. melting and <b>burning</b> solids). <b>Index</b> Terms—physically based modeling, melting, burn-ing, solid, liquid, gas, phase change, Lagrangian mesh, Eulerian grid, adaptive mesh.

In addition, the sensitivity, thermal and mechanical properties of the compositions were also evaluated. The composition containing ammonium chlorate(VII) (AP) 65 %, Al 15 %, binder 20 % and biuret 0 - 6 % over the batch were prepared. The composition containing 6 % biuret over the batch was insensitive to friction and impact. As the amount of biuret was increased, the energy, burning rate and sensitivity decreased, whilst the auto ignition temperature increased.

40|$|Self-potential {{signals and}} {{resistivity}} {{data can be}} jointly inverted or analyzed to track {{the position of the}} burning front of an underground coal-seam fire. We first investigate the magnitude of the thermoelectric coupling associated with the presence of a thermal anomaly (thermoelectric current associated with a thermal gradient). A sandbox experiment is developed and modeled to show that in presence of a heat source, a negative self-potential anomaly is expected at the ground surface. The expected sensitivity coefficient is typically on the order of - 0. 5 mV degrees C- 1 in a silica sand saturated by demineralized water. Geophysical field measurements gathered at Marshall (near Boulder, CO) show clearly the position of the burning front in the electrical resistivity tomogram and in the self-potential data gathered at the ground surface with a negative self-potential anomaly of about - 50 mV. To localize more accurately the position of the burning front, we developed a strategy based on two steps: (1) We first jointly invert resistivity and self-potential data using a cross-gradient approach, and (2) a joint interpretation of the resistivity and self-potential data is made using a normalized <b>burning</b> front <b>index</b> (NBI). The value of the NBI ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating a high probability to find the burning front (strictly speaking, the NBI is, however, not a probably density). We validate first this strategy using synthetic data and then we apply it to the field data. A clear source is localized at the expected position of the burning front of the coal-seam fire. The NBI determined from the joint inversion is only slightly better than the value determined from independent inversion of the two geophysical data sets...|$|R
30|$|Past {{attempts}} to suppress all fires in some western forests have altered historic fire regimes. Accumulated debris and dense understories of shade tolerant species {{coupled with a}} warmer climate have led to catastrophic wildfires. Prescribed fires and wildland fire use fires are used by land managers to reduce fuels and restore natural conditions. Little is known about how wildfires, prescribed fires, and wildland fire use fires differ in their fire regime attributes. We compared the attributes of start date, duration, 95 th percentile <b>burning</b> <b>index,</b> size, fire rotation and fire return interval, and fire severity of 144 fires > 40 ha that occurred in Yosemite National Park from 1974 through 2005, and mean patch size and patch squareness (an index of complexity) of 106 fires that occurred from 1984 through 2005. We used fire history, weather records, and the Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) derived from satellite imagery to make the comparisons. Prescribed fires started both earlier and later than wildfires and wildland fire use fires, and had the shortest return intervals. Prescribed fires burned during periods with a lower 95 th percentile <b>burning</b> <b>index</b> (an estimate of potential flame length and fire line intensity), and resulted in larger patches that were unchanged or that burned with low severity. Wildfires were the largest in size and had the largest percent area burned at moderate and high severity. Wildfires also had the largest moderate and high severity patches, and the high severity patches were the most square. The significant differences in fire regime attributes suggest that land managers seeking to restore natural fire regimes and forest composition and structure must consider more than the metrics of area burned or fuel loading.|$|E

Wind speed alone has a higher correlation with burn area than BI, for instance, and a simple alternative point process model using wind speed, relative humidity, precipitation and temperature well outperforms the BI in terms of predictive power.

Much research {{has been carried out}} to understand mechanism of suppression but literature about the action of OXA and ADA on the combustion characteristics of propellant is still scarce. Here, a systematic study on coolant-based propellants has been undertaken spanning from thermal analyses of ingredients to a variety of burning processes of the corresponding propellants. Thermal gravimetric analysis and differential thermal analysis on individual coolants are carried out to study their behaviour with temperature. It was noticed that the thermal decomposition of OXA exhibits only endothermic effects, whereas that of ADA presents both endothermic and exothermic effects. Successive experiments on solid propellant looking at burning rate characterization, condensed combustion product collection and visualization, pressure deflagration limit and thermochemical analysis gave a greater insight and enabled better understanding of the action of coolants during combustion. It is proposed that OXA and ADA are acting on both the condensed and gas phases.

Aims: To investigate suicide and non-suicide mortality after non-fatal self-harm in Taipei City, Taiwan. Method: Prospective cohort study (median follow-up 3. 3 years) of 7601 individuals presenting to hospital with self-harm (January 2004 to December 2006). Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) for suicide and non-suicide mortality were calculated. Results: Suicide risk in the year following self-harm was over 100 times {{higher than in the}} general population (SMR = 119. 6, 95 % CI 99. 6 - 142. 5). Males and middle-aged and older adults had the highest subsequent risk of suicide. Compared with people who took an overdose, individuals who used hanging or charcoal <b>burning</b> in their <b>index</b> episode had the highest risk of suicide. For non-suicide mortality the SMRs were 6. 7 (95 % CI 5. 7 - 7. 8) in the first year and 4. 4 (95 % CI 3. 9 - 4. 9) during the whole follow-up period. Conclusions: Patterns of increased all-cause and suicide mortality following an episode of self-harm are similar in Taipei City to those seen in Western countries. Designing better aftercare following non-fatal self-harm, particularly for those with underlying physical disorders or who have used lethal self-harm methods, should be a priority for suicide prevention programmes in Asia. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

Several studies in Nigeria have documented the pollution levels from coarse particles but very few have elucidated the nature of the fine particles in the context of air quality index. Our investigation therefore focused on air quality index in relation to ambient fine particulate and composition of PM 2. 5 collected from an industrial area (IA) and a university community (UC) in Ogun State, Nigeria. The PM 2. 5 samples were collected using Environtech gravimetric sampler according to standard methods. The morphology and elemental composition of PM 2. 5 were assessed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). The SEM images of fine particles indicated the following clustered groups: soot particles, alumino silicates, and mixture of alumino silicate with soot. Energy dispersive X-ray spectra showed nine most abundant elemental composition in all samples. Possible source emissions of elements identified by principal component analysis are industrial processes, vehicle emissions, crustal dust, fuel-oil and biomass <b>burning.</b> Air quality <b>index</b> (AQI), for particulate pollution was calculated for each location. Fine particle pollution indices scaled from 51 to 500, reflecting six out of the seven AQI categories in varying proportions.

We therefore used a multi-step process to generate and then calibrate specific weather, wind, and fuel moisture inputs based on the available data. First, we estimated fine fuel moisture values using the reported weather conditions and standard fuel moisture tables (Rothermel 1983). We then adjusted specific weather and fuel moisture inputs, while remaining within the general documented range, within the NFDRS Calculator of FireFamily Plus 3.05 (Rocky Mountain Research Station Fire Sciences Lab and Systems for Environmental Management 2002) until the specific BI reported for the Manter Fire resulted.|$|E

Fire type (ground, surface, or crown fire) was not considered because historic data on type were not available. In addition to fire return interval for each fire, we also calculated fire rotation for the vegetation zones. We used start date and duration to depict seasonality and the <b>burning</b> <b>index</b> to represent fire line intensity. We determined fire size, return interval, rotation, severity, and spatial complexity from the satellite-derived fire severity maps. We used mean patch size (MPS) and patch squareness (SqP) to represent spatial complexity (Frohn 1998). Mean patch size {{is a measure of}} fragmentation, and patch squareness is a measure of complexity. Patch squareness is an index that runs from 0 for square, minimally complex patches, to 1 for patches that were least square-like and highly complex.

The experimental design was a factorial comparison among three water volumes (40, 80 and 120 % evapotranspiration (ET)), four nitrogen fertilization levels (0, 80, 160 and 240 kg ha- 1) and two genotypes (cv TN 86 and the hybrid R 7 - 11).

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} the effect of different levels of turbulence intensity and properties of the fuel/air mixture on the structure and characteristics of lean flames stabilized on an axisymmetric bluff body is described in this thesis. Simultaneous imaging of hydroxyl (OH) and formaldehyde (CH 2 O) by planar laser induced fluorescence and particle image velocimetry (PIV) were used to study the interaction between the flame and the flow field. CH 2 O fluorescence and the pixel-by-pixel multiplication of OH and CH 2 O fluorescence signals were utilized to mark preheat and heat release regions respectively. In addition, high-speed chemiluminescence imaging was performed to understand the time resolved characteristics of the flame. The first part of the thesis focuses on the characteristics of stably burning lean methane/-, propane/- and ethylene/air flames when subjected to low (4 %), moderate (14 %) and intense (24 and 30 %) levels of free stream turbulence. The flame front structure was observed to be strongly dependent on the free stream turbulence level of the incoming fuel/air mixture as well on the properties of the fuel/air mixture. Formation of cusps and unburnt mixture fingers were observed as the turbulence intensity was increased from 4 to 14 % but, the heat release region remained continuous. Under intense turbulence conditions, methane/- and ethylene/air (f = 0. 85) flames exhibited localized extinctions along the flame sheet and flamelet merging events which created isolated pockets of reactants in the flame envelope. In addition to these features, propane/- and ethylene/air (f= 0. 655) flames exhibited the occurrence of flame fragmentation events and the general shape of these flames were observed to intermittently switch from a symmetric (varicose) to asymmetric (sinuous) mode. Several properties were measured to characterize the effects of turbulence – flame interaction which includes the average preheat and reaction zone thicknesses, strain rates and curvature along the flame front, burning fraction, flame brush thickness, flame surface density, area ratio and turbulent flame speed. The next part of the thesis focuses on blowoff dynamics of lean methane/-, propane/- and ethylene/air flames for mean velocities of 5, 10 and 15 m/s and subjected to free stream turbulence levels from 4 to 30 %. Apart from the propane/air flames at an apporach velcoity of 5 m/s and turbulence intensity of 30 %, increasing turbulence intensity was found to reduce the flame stability. The blowoff equivalence ratios of propane/air flames was observed to be higher than methane/- and ethylene/air flames. As blowoff was approached, the flame front and shear layer vortices entangled inducing high local strain rates on the flame front that exceed the extinction strain rate resulting in significant breaks along the reaction zone. At conditions near blowoff, significant increase in the frequency of breaks along the reaction zone was observed for low and moderate turbulence conditions. For the higher turbulence conditions, fragmentation of the flame along with the presence of sinuous wakes was observed which aided in the penetration of reactants into the recirculation zone. Velocity vectors near the flame holes indicate the penetration of the reactants into the recirculation zone. Mostly similar sequence of events was observed for methane/-, propane/- and ethylene/air flames near blowoff. Several properties weremeasured to characterize the near blowoff flames which include the strain rate and curvature statistics along the flame front, <b>burning</b> fraction, asymmetric <b>index</b> and the average duration of the blowoff event. Based on the observation from the experiments, turbulent flame speed was attributed to be the primary factor in governing the blowoff equivalence ratio. This point of view was examined by comparing the mean strain rate of methane/- and ethylene/air flames at the equivalence ratio corresponding to near blowoff for propane/air flames...|$|R

Methods  We use a fire risk index, the Chandler <b>burning</b> <b>index</b> (CBI), {{as an indicator of}} the ‘natural’, eco-climatic fire seasonality, across all types of ecosystems. A simple metric, the middle of the fire season, is computed from both gridded CBI data and satellite-derived fire detections. We then interpret the difference between the eco-climatic and observed metrics as an indicator of the human footprint on fire seasonality. Results  Deforestation, shifting cultivation, cropland production or tropical savanna fires are associated with specific timings due to land-use practices, sometimes largely decoupled from the CBI dynamics. Detailed time series from relevant locations provide comprehensive information about these practices and how they are adapted to eco-climatic conditions. Main conclusions  We find a great influence of anthropogenic activities on global patterns of fire seasonality. The specificity of the main fire practices and their easy identification from global observation is a potential tool to support land-use monitoring efforts. Our results should also prove valuable {{in the development of a}} methodological approach for improving the representation of anthropogenic fire practices in dynamic global vegetation models...|$|E
30|$|Fire {{seasonality}} {{is defined}} as a combination of the date a fire starts and its duration. Fire return interval is the length of time between fires at a specific point on the landscape and can be expressed as a mean, median, minimum, or maximum. Other measures related to fire return interval include fire rotation, which is the time necessary for fire to burn an area equivalent to the total area of an ecosystem (Heinselman 1978), and fire frequency, which is the inverse of fire return interval. Fire size is the area burned by the fire, and spatial complexity {{is defined as}} the variability in the patchiness and gradient structure of the burned area. Fireline intensity is the rate of energy release per unit of fire flaming front. Although other measures of fire intensity, such as reaction intensity, might be better related to fire effects, fireline intensity can be visualized through its relationship with flame length (Byram 1959) and the <b>burning</b> <b>index,</b> an estimate of potential flame length and fireline intensity (Deeming et al. 1977). Fireline intensity is also the measure of fire magnitude that is most commonly understood and used by fire behavior analysts. Fire severity is defined as the magnitude of the effect that a fire has on the environment (van Wagtendonk 2006). It is commonly measured using remote sensing indexes, but other methods such as field surveys of fire effects are also used (Key 2006, Key and Benson 2004). Fire type describes the vegetation and fuel layers through which a fire propagates and includes ground fires, surface fires, and crown fires. Van Wagner (1977) defined three phases of crown fires: passive crown fires torch individual trees or groups of trees, active crown fires spread through the crowns in conjunction with a surface fire, and independent crown fires spread far ahead of or {{in the absence of a}} surface fire.|$|E
