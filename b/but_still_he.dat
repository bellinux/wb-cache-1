25|$|The airport, which {{normally}} {{should have been}} closed due to the severe conditions, was not declared closed as its management feared that this could cause a diplomatic incident. According to the news agency Interfax, the pilot was told that Smolensk North Airport was enveloped in thick fog and strongly advised against landing, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>he</b> decided {{to continue with the}} original flight plan and attempt a landing. According to an interview with a flight controller Pavel Plusnin it was suggested to the pilot that he land at an alternative airfield in Moscow or Minsk. According to Plusnin, the pilot said, that he would attempt one approach, and if landing was not possible, he would then divert to another airfield.|$|E
25|$|This injury {{affected}} {{his performance in}} rest of the matches and he was dropped from the next match against Scotland. After the dramatic collapse of Pakistani batting line up in 1999 world cup final against Australia, Ijaz remained the top scorer of the innings with 22 runs. He was also the batsman who was surprisingly {{held responsible for the}} batting collapse in the final match. This regular succession of poor performances, led to isolation of Ijaz from the national team and so he was {{not a part of the}} national team in the Toronto Cricket Festival of 1999 against the West Indies and Sharjah Cup of late 1999. Though he was given a chance in test series against Australia and the Carlton & United Series against India and Australia, during which he performed well both in the test and one day series. In the third test, Ijaz Ahmad scored his 12th test century and sixth against Australia at Perth, a match which Pakistan eventually lost by an Innings and some runs. In the following triangular series, Ijaz Ahmad scored three half centuries, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>he</b> was unable to take the confidence of selectors and was again dropped from the team for than a year.|$|E

500|$|Montgomery {{was also}} mourned in Britain. Whigs {{attempted}} {{to use his}} death to show {{the failure of the}} British policies on the American Colonies. Prime Minister Lord Frederick North acknowledged Montgomery's military ability but said [...] "I cannot join in lamenting the death of Montgomery as a public loss. Curse on his virtues! They've undone his country. He was brave, he was able, he was humane, he was generous, <b>but</b> <b>still,</b> <b>he</b> was only a brave, able, humane, and generous rebel." [...] Newspapers in London paid tribute to Montgomery, with the Evening Post bordering its March 12 edition in black as a sign of mourning.|$|E

500|$|On {{the next}} racing day, the other riders were {{reluctant}} to continue racing and asked the organisers for a postponement. France's Stablinski suggested that the race continue, with a British rider, whose team would wear black armbands, allowed to win the stage. Hoban won the stage, although many thought the stage winner should have been Denson, Simpson's close friend. Media reports suggested that his death was caused by heat exhaustion, until, on 31 July 1967 British journalist J. L. Manning of the Daily Mail broke the news about a formal connection between drugs and Simpson's death. French authorities confirmed that Simpson had traces of amphetamine in his body, impairing his judgement and allowing him to push himself beyond his limits. His death contributed {{to the introduction of}} mandatory testing for performance-enhancing drugs in cycling, leading to tests in 1968 at the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and Summer Olympics. Simpson was buried in Harworth Cemetery, after a service at the 12th-century village church attended by an estimated 5,000 mourners, including Peugeot teammate Eddy Merckx, the only continental rider in attendance.

The distance from the stress and noise of Westminster was an enormous psychological and spiritual relief to Fox, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>he</b> defended his earlier principles: [...] "It is a great comfort to me to reflect how steadily I have opposed this war, for the miseries it seems likely to produce are without end." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), in chapter [...] as Lot {{was sitting at}} the gate of Sodom in the evening, the two angels arrived, and Lot greeted them and bowed low to the ground. Lot invited the angels to spend the night at his house and bathe their feet, but they said that they would spend the night in the square. Lot urged them strongly, so they went to his house, and he {{prepared}} a feast for them and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. Before they had retired for the night, all the men of Sodom gathered about the house shouting to Lot to bring his visitors out so that they might be intimate with them. Lot went outside the entrance, shutting the door behind him, and begged the men of Sodom not commit such a wrong. Lot offered the men his two virgin daughters for them to do with as they pleased, if they would not do anything to his guests, but they disparaged Lot as one who had come as an alien and now sought to rule them, and they pressed threateningly against him and the door. But the visitors stretched out their hands and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door and struck the people with blindness so that they were unable to find the entrance. The visitors directed Lot to bring what family he had out of the city, for they were about to destroy the place, because the outcry against its inhabitants had become so great. So Lot told his sons-in-law that they needed {{to get out of the}} place because God was about to destroy it, but Lot's sons-in-law thought that he was joking. As dawn broke, the angels urged Lot to flee with his wife and two remaining daughters, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>he</b> delayed. So out of God's mercy, the men seized Lot, his wife, and daughters by the hand and brought them out of the city, telling them to flee for their lives and not to stop or look back anywhere in the plain. But Lot asked them whether he might flee to a little village nearby. The third reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
