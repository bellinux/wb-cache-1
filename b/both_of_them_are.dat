5|$|Both {{articles}} {{address the}} issue of who the killer could alternatively have been, and both of them mention Carol's other lovers, and John Rapson, responsible for murdering Carol's sister. Both of the articles mention {{that he was in the}} Barrow area around the time of the murder, but <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> careful to point out that they are not accusing him of being the murderer.|$|E
5|$|Nigel Dick {{directed}} the music video for Dion's version, with Simon Archer as cinematographer and Jaromir Svarc as art director. It was shot between 29 June and 3 July 1996 {{in the summer}} palace of the Austrian Emperor, Ploskovice and Barandov Studios, Prague, Czech Republic; it was later released in July 1996. Castle Ploskovice in Ploskovice supplied {{the exterior of the}} gothic mansion. There are two versions of this music video; the full version (about 7:44 in length) and the single version (about 6:00 in length). <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> included on Dion's 2001 DVD video collection All the Way... A Decade of Song & Video.|$|E
5|$|Shout-out to Mariah Carey and {{her whole}} squad and my boy Chris Lighty. He got me and Mariah together. I {{appreciate}} it. He {{put me on}} there as well as her. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E

5|$|Ventus was {{designed}} by director Tetsuya Nomura who {{wanted to create a}} character with an important connection with the series' main character Sora. Ventus bears a strong resemblance to the character of Roxas, both of whom are voiced by Kōki Uchiyama in Japanese and Jesse McCartney in English. After Ventus' first cameo, Nomura had to state that <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> different characters, and the reason for such connection would be revealed in Birth by Sleep. Video game websites also commented on Ventus' first appearance, initially confusing him for Roxas during the development of Birth by Sleep, but has since been well received.|$|E
5|$|Also {{developed}} by Probe Entertainment, the Sega Game Gear and Master System ports {{are similar to}} the Game Boy port, but in color instead of in monochrome. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> almost identical, except for the reduced size of the Game Gear screen, featuring the same fighters and arenas as the Game Boy port, but with the addition of Kintaro. The arena where players fight Jade and Smoke is exclusive to each version. Unlike the Game Boy version, blood is present, but was drastically reduced in quantity when compared to other ports. Because of the systems' limited graphical resources, some of the Fatalities in the game were altered to completely destroy the opponent's body, leaving generic gibs of bones and limbs, while others were also simplified to use common animations.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Grace and Jack are {{discussing}} their own problems. Grace uses Jack's promiscuous history with married men {{as a legitimate}} reason to have {{an affair with a}} married man, but Jack tells her to forget about it as <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> the moral role models to their friends. After being honest with her, Jack confesses that the reason he is wearing an eye patch is not because he got glitter in his eye, as he told his friends. When he refused to stop his singing performance during the debut of his new talk show, Jack Talk, even though the entire set had accidentally been set on fire, his eyebrow was burnt off. Later, Will, Grace, and Jack all decide that it would be for the best to let Karen know the truth about Stan. Will breaks the news to her, but Karen believes he is joking. Rosario tells Karen that Stan is not dead, as she has been giving him reports on Karen. At the admission, Karen fires Rosario and leaves Will's apartment with Malcolm, explaining that Stan may be alive, but that he is still dead to her.|$|E

5|$|Rhonda Latimer, {{an aging}} {{reporter}} for Fox News Channel who is idolized by viewers {{because of her}} good looks, is dismissed when the network's first high-definition broadcast exposes her wrinkles, leaving a job opportunity open. Lois auditions for the part, ignoring Brian's warnings that Fox News is a heavily biased network, and she is chosen as the new reporter. On her first day reporting, she is assigned to do an exposé on Michael Moore {{to prove that he}} is a homosexual. When she spies on him outside his house, she sees Rush Limbaugh coming out, leading her to conclude that Limbaugh and Moore are in a gay relationship. However, Fox News refuses to allow any material against fellow conservative Limbaugh to be broadcast, leading Lois to realize that Brian was right about them. The two decide to take the story into their own hands and confront who they expect to be Moore and a naked Limbaugh in the same bedroom, only to discover that the <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> portrayed by Fred Savage, who has created bodysuits of them in order to continue his acting career. A flabbergasted Lois ultimately decides to report his story instead.|$|E
5|$|The second {{version was}} a lyric video, which {{features}} Hamasaki in a recording studio. It also features candid photos of Hamasaki in Los Angeles, Japan, and doing other endeavours outside of music. The Riff Studio version features Hamasaki as her character design AyuPan and a character titled the Bloody Bunny. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> {{in a space}} ship, and travel throughout different worlds and atmospheres, until landing on a planet with blue aliens. The aliens appear to be sad, whist AyuPan and the Bloody Bunny stand there. AyuPan then plays the song from her space ship, and makes the aliens feel happy; they all begin dancing to the track. It ends with the world turning pink instead of blue, and has heart shapes around it. This version premiered one week before the album's release in July 2, and was included on the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of Colours.|$|E
5|$|With a {{population}} or over 200,000 and a size of 39,890 hectares, it comprises {{a substantial part}} of the former larger Kuala Terengganu district. Significant development in the areas of higher education and housing projects have occurred there in contemporary times. The main population centres of Kuala Nerus include Manir and Batu Rakit. Among major education institutions located in this district are Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin, The Institute of Teacher Education Dato Razali Ismail Campus and an industrial training institute. The Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA) Teaching Hospital is now under construction, thus providing this district with a new establishment. The Sultan Mahmud Airport is located within the district, as is the multipurpose Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin Stadium. Although Kuala Nerus and Kuala Terengganu are now two districts on their own, since <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> under the administration of the same local government, this makes MBKT among the few local governments in Malaysia to manage two different districts.|$|E
