In this project, {{there are two main}} issues; first one is about finding a way to implement the function <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>connector.</b> And the other one is to build a framework for flexible connectors. By studying on Java’s dynamic proxy, we find we can use it to implement the function <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>connector.</b> When building <b>a</b> <b>connector</b> chain, we use an important Java technique [...] Java Reflection API...|$|R
