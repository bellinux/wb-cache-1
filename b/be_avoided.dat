5|$|In many cases, {{complicated}} limit calculations {{by direct}} application of Newton's difference quotient can <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> using differentiation rules. Some {{of the most}} basic rules are the following.|$|E

5|$|Like other soluble fluorides, CsF is {{moderately}} toxic. Contact with acid should <b>be</b> <b>avoided,</b> as this forms highly toxic/corrosive hydrofluoric acid. The caesium ion (Cs+) and caesium chloride {{are generally}} not considered toxic.|$|E
5|$|Some clock-shift {{problems}} could <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> by adjusting clocks continuously {{or at least}} more gradually—for example, Willett at first suggested weekly 20-minute transitions—but this would add complexity {{and has never been}} implemented.|$|E
5|$|The labor tax {{took the}} form of conscripted labor for one month per year, which was imposed upon male commoners aged fifteen to fifty-six. This could <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> in Eastern Han with a commutable tax, since hired labor became more popular.|$|E
5000|$|In South Africa, NEMA {{requires}} [...] "that {{pollution and}} {{degradation of the}} environment <b>are</b> <b>avoided,</b> or, where they cannot <b>be</b> altogether <b>avoided,</b> <b>are</b> minimised and remedied." ...|$|R

5|$|Viewing the Sun during partial and annular eclipses (and during total eclipses {{outside the}} {{brief period of}} totality) {{requires}} special eye protection, or indirect viewing methods if eye damage is to <b>be</b> <b>avoided.</b> The Sun's disk can be viewed using appropriate filtration to block the harmful part of the Sun's radiation. Sunglasses do not make viewing the Sun safe. Only properly designed and certified solar filters {{should be used for}} direct viewing of the Sun's disk. Especially, self-made filters using common objects such as a floppy disk removed from its case, a Compact Disc, a black colour slide film, smoked glass, etc. must <b>be</b> <b>avoided.</b>|$|E
5|$|A prostitute is {{available}} {{as soon as}} the game starts. Should Larry have unprotected intercourse with her, he will contract a sexually-transmitted disease and die shortly thereafter. This fate may <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> by buying a condom at the convenience store. Larry questions the validity of losing his virginity to a prostitute, but the game resumes without a time limit.|$|E
5|$|During the Eastern Han, peasants {{could avoid}} {{the month of}} annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in {{commutation}} (gengfu 更賦). This development went {{hand in hand with}} the increasing use of hired labor by the government. In a similar manner, because the Eastern-Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty-three could <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> by paying a tax in substitution.|$|E

5|$|Early {{decompression}} theory generally {{assumed that}} inert gas bubble {{formation in the}} tissues could <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> during decompression, and {{the aim of the}} decompression tables and algorithms was to prevent bubble formation while minimising decompression time. Most dissolved phase models are perfusion limited, and differ mainly by the number of compartments, the range of half-times, and supersaturation tolerances assumed. These models are commonly referred to as Haldanean.|$|E
5|$|Excessive use {{of alcohol}} is also known to affect the {{metabolism}} of warfarin and can elevate the INR and thus {{increase the risk of}} bleeding. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) product insert on warfarin states that alcohol should <b>be</b> <b>avoided.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gastrointestinal upset {{can cause}} severe discomfort; {{it is most}} common when {{metformin}} is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can often <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7grams per day) and increasing the dose gradually but even with low doses 5% of people {{may be unable to}} tolerate metformin. Use of slow- or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability.|$|E
30|$|Quality {{improvement}} of mesh elements (edges, vertices, triangles) {{is an important}} goal in surface remeshing. Typically regular vertices are preferred. Short edges and triangles with small or large angles <b>are</b> <b>avoided</b> to improve the efficiency of numerical simulations [71]. Similarly, aspect ratio close to 0 <b>is</b> <b>avoided</b> [67, 72].|$|R

5|$|If possible, {{the use of}} {{wood and}} {{cellulose}} derivatives should <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> entirely. Many varnishes and paints are well known emitters of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), {{some of which may}} be acidic, and thus have the potential to damage calcium carbonate specimens. Because of this, these coatings should also be avoided; water-based varnishes and paints are considered less harmful, and should be preferred.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, {{the first}} book on tornadoes was written by John Park Finley, {{a pioneer in the}} field of tornado research. While it was a revolutionary book {{containing}} many breakthrough ideas, it contained a few ideas which have since been proven false. One of these was the idea that the northeast or east part of a structure was the least safe, and should <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> when seeking shelter from a tornado.|$|E
5|$|In {{those who}} have had stones, {{prevention}} is by drinking fluids such that more than two liters of urine are produced per day. If this is not effective enough, thiazide diuretic, citrate, or allopurinol may be taken. It is recommended that soft drinks containing phosphoric acid (typically colas) <b>be</b> <b>avoided.</b>|$|E

5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} used in {{neonatal intensive care}} units. When used, additional caution is required in newborns; midazolam {{should not be used}} for longer than 72 hours due to risks of tachyphylaxis, and the possibility of development of a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, as well as neurological complications. Bolus injections should <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> due to the increased risk of cardiovascular depression, as well as neurological complications.|$|E
5|$|Realising that {{a battle}} could not <b>be</b> <b>avoided,</b> Bahadur ShahI marched towards Agra, having decided {{to fight a}} battle at Dholpur (34 miles from the city).

He was ordered to capture the forts in Chambal (one mile from Dholpur).|$|E
5|$|The edibility of {{the fruit}} bodies of Agaricus deserticola is not known definitively, and there are {{conflicting}} opinions in the literature, with some sources claiming that the edibility is unknown, and consumption should <b>be</b> <b>avoided.</b> However, one popular field guide to North American mushrooms suggests they are edible when they are young, and have a pleasant odor and mild taste.|$|E
