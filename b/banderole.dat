25|$|In the mid 20th century, art {{historian}} Volker Herzner noted the facial {{similarity between the}} Cumaean Sibyl and Philip's wife Isabella of Portugal, especially as she is portrayed in van Eyck's lost 1428–29 betrothal portrait. Herzner speculated that the text in the <b>banderole</b> in the sibyl's panel has a double meaning, referring {{not only to the}} coming of Christ, but also to the 1432 birth of Philip's first son and heir to survive infancy. Others reject this idea, given the high rates of infant mortality at the time, and the connotations of bad luck usually associated with acclaiming a son before he is born.|$|E
500|$|The woodblock {{fragment}} Bois Protat ( [...] ("Protat wood"); also Protat {{block or}} Protat woodblock, [...] ) is a fragmentary woodblock for printing, {{and the images}} on it are the oldest surviving woodcut images from the Western world. [...] It is cut on both sides, with a scene from Christ's crucifixion on the recto, and a kneeling angel from a presumed Annunciation scene on the verso. [...] The crucifixion scene likely consisted of three or more blocks; the surviving block fragment features Longinus the Roman centurion at the Crucifixion, shown speaking with a <b>banderole,</b> a mediaeval precursor to the modern speech balloon containing his words.|$|E

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the abstract nature of Mesoamerican speech scrolls, Medieval European speech scrolls or <b>banderoles</b> appear as actual scrolls, floating in apparent three-dimensional space (or in actual space in sculpture). They first become common {{at the start of}} the Gothic period. Previously, as in Byzantine art, spoken words, if they appeared at all, were usually painted alongside a figure; these are called tituli. However, earlier works using <b>banderoles</b> are the Aachen Gospels of Otto III (c. 975) and the 12th-century English Romanesque Cloisters Cross. The latter work demonstrates the use of <b>banderoles</b> as attributes for Old Testament prophets, to distinguish them from the book-carrying Four Evangelists of the New Testament and other Christian saints, a convention appearing in Italy in the 13th century. It may be seen in the Santa Trinita Maestà by Cimabue, (Uffizi, 1280-90), Duccio's Maestà (1308-11), and other works. The convention had a historical appropriateness, as the Old Testament was originally written on scrolls, whereas nearly all surviving New Testament manuscripts are codices (like modern books). They may also be used for the words of angels, especially Gabriel's greeting to Mary in Annunciation scenes. [...] During the 14th century, quotations in <b>banderoles</b> increasingly allowed artists to include more complex ideas in their works, though for the moment usually in Latin, thus greatly restricting the audience that could follow them.|$|R

500|$|Agnes and {{her sister}} were virgins of Rome {{in the time of}} the Emperor Constantine, though all figures are shown in {{contemporary}} 14th-century dress. The story begins {{on the inside of the}} bowl, which has a round medallion showing St Agnes kneeling before a bearded figure, representing her teacher, wearing a chaperon. She holds a book inscribed Miserere mei Deus sancte ("Have pity on me, Holy God"), while a <b>banderole</b> says In corde meo abscondi eloquia tua ut non peccem tibi ("Thy words have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee". [...] ). [...] The top of the cover continues the story up to Agnes' martyrdom in five scenes, shown with a continuous groundline from which small rocks rise up to demarcate the scenes; on the base trees perform this function. Sunrays radiate from the centre of the cover above all the scenes; the red enamel which once filled these is nearly all lost.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} scene the two girls are {{returning}} from school, Agnes accompanied by her punning attribute, a lamb with a cruciform halo, and carrying a martyr's palm. They are accosted by Procopius, the young son of the Prefect of Rome, who has {{fallen in love with}} Agnes and shows her an open casket of jewels to persuade her to marry him. The inside of the casket is white, the only colour of opaque enamel in the original work, used only for a few highlights like the tiny area of the host held by Christ {{on the inside of the}} cover. Agnes [...] rejects him, with the words Illi sum desponsata cui angeli serviunt ("I am betrothed to him who the angels serve") in a <b>banderole</b> above. In the Caxton her rejection is unequivocal and not polite, and she points out that her heavenly fiancé has promised her much better jewels. [...] The Prefect stands behind his son, and in the next scene has sentenced her to serve in a brothel for being a Christian who refuses to sacrifice to the goddess Vesta. Caxton's Legend fills in the intervening action: Then made she of the bordel her oratory, ... All they that entered made honour and reverence to the great clearness that they saw about St. Agnes, and came out more devout and more clean than they entered. At last came the son of the provost with a great company for to accomplish his foul desires and lusts. And when he saw his fellows come out and issue all abashed, he mocked them and called them cowards. And then he, all araged, entered for to accomplish his evil will. And when he came to the clearness, he advanced him for to take the virgin, and anon the devil took him by the throat and strangled him that he fell down dead. In the next scene on the cup, Agnes stands outside the sentry box-like brothel, looking down at the Prefect's son who has been strangled to death by the devil crouched over him; a <b>banderole</b> reads Quo modo cecidisti qui mane oriebaris ("How has thou fallen that risest in the morning", [...] ), and the Prefect looks on sadly.|$|E
500|$|The scenes {{continue}} {{on the underside of}} the bowl, starting with Agnes' burial. A pall is being laid over her sarcophagus, whose red enamel has significant losses, which reveal clearly the engraved lines beneath. A tonsured priest with an aspergil for sprinkling holy water and an acolyte with a cross attend, with Emerentiana with halo to the left, and Agnes' mother to the right. The <b>banderole</b> above says Ecce quod concupivi iam teneo ("Behold what I have desired I now possess"). In the next scene pagans have arrived to disrupt the burial, and only Emerentiana has stayed, kneeling in prayer as she is pelted with rocks. The inscription reads Veni soror mea mecum in gloria ("Come with me my sister into glory"). She dies, and the following scene shows the two martyrs, accompanied by two other unnamed female martyrs (in the source [...] "a great multitude of virgins clad in vestments of gold and silver"), as they appear in a vision to Agnes' friends eight days after her death, as they gather round her sarcophagus, into which Emerentiana's body has also been placed.|$|E

Chandos hath persuaded the prince to leave many behind, and indeed I {{think that he}} is right, for there is little food and less water in these parts for which we are bound. A man without his meat or a horse without his fodder is like a wet bow-string, fit for little. But voila, mon petit, here comes Chandos and his company, and there is many a pensil and <b>banderole</b> among yonder squadrons which show that the best blood of England is riding under his banners." ...|$|E
60|$|He rode, not a mule, {{like his}} companion, but a strong hackney for the road, {{to save his}} gallant war-horse, which a squire led behind, fully accoutred for battle, with a chamfron or plaited {{head-piece}} upon his head, having a short spike projecting from the front. On {{one side of the}} saddle hung a short battle-axe, richly inlaid with Damascene carving; on the other the rider's plumed head-piece and hood of mail, with a long two-handed sword, used by the chivalry of the period. A second squire held aloft his master's lance, from the extremity of which fluttered a small <b>banderole,</b> or streamer, bearing a cross of the same form with that embroidered upon his cloak. He also carried his small triangular shield, broad enough at the top to protect the breast, and from thence diminishing to a point. It was covered with a scarlet cloth, which prevented the device from being seen.|$|E
60|$|As {{the prince}} spoke, amid a loud {{flourish}} of trumpets and the shouting of the Gascon party, {{the last of}} the assailants rode gallantly into the lists. He was a man of great size, clad in black armor without blazonry or ornament of any kind, for all worldly display was forbidden by the rules of the military brotherhood to which he belonged. No plume or nobloy fluttered from his plain tilting salade, and even his lance was devoid of the customary <b>banderole.</b> A white mantle fluttered behind him, upon the left side of which was marked the broad black cross picked out with silver which was the well-known badge of the Teutonic Order. Mounted upon a horse as large, as black, and as forbidding as himself, he cantered slowly forward, with none of those prancings and gambades with which a cavalier was accustomed to show his command over his charger. Gravely and sternly he inclined his head to the prince, and took his place at the further end of the arena.|$|E

Demonstrations against the organization then ensued, with young protesters carrying <b>banderoles</b> reading [...] "Ammazzateci tutti!", Italian for [...] "Kill us all". The national government started a large-scale enforcement operation in Calabria and arrested numerous 'ndranghetisti including the murderers of Fortugno.|$|R
50|$|European speech scrolls may {{at times}} {{be seen in}} secular works as well and may also contain {{the name of a}} person to {{identify}} them. On carved figures the words would usually be painted on the scroll and have since worn away. In some Late Gothic and Renaissance works, and in architectural decoration, very elaborate empty <b>banderoles</b> seem to be for decorative purposes only.|$|R

60|$|The prince's reception-room, {{although}} of {{no great}} size, was fitted {{up with all}} the state and luxury which the fame and power of its owner demanded. A high dais at the further end was roofed in by a broad canopy of scarlet velvet spangled with silver fleurs-de-lis, and supported at either corner by silver rods. This was approached by four steps carpeted with the same material, while all round were scattered rich cushions, oriental mats and costly rugs of fur. The choicest tapestries which the looms of Arras could furnish draped the walls, whereon the battles of Judas Maccabaeus were set forth, with the Jewish warriors in plate of proof, with crest and lance and <b>banderole,</b> as the naive artists of the day were wont to depict them. A few rich settles and bancals, choicely carved and decorated with glazed leather hangings of the sort termed or basane, completed the furniture of the apartment, save that at one side of the dais there stood a lofty perch, upon which a cast of three solemn Prussian gerfalcons sat, hooded and jesseled, as silent and motionless as the royal fowler who stood beside them.|$|E

25|$|Zechariah and Micah {{look down}} on the {{fulfillment}} of their prophecies contained in the <b>banderoles</b> floating behind them. The Erythraean Sibyl is shown observing, while the Cumaean Sibyl, wearing a green dress with thick fur sleeves, gazes down at Mary, her hand held in empathy over her own womb. Micah's lunettes are an early instance of an illusionistic motif, wherein the sense of the boundary between the painting, frame and viewer's space becomes blurred. In this example, the prophet knowingly places his hand outwards on the lower border of the frame.|$|R
2500|$|The Jesse Tree was {{the only}} prophecy in the Old Testament to be so {{literally}} and frequently illustrated, and so came also to stand for the Prophets, and their foretelling of Christ, in general. Both the St-Denis and Chartres windows include columns of prophets, as do many depictions. Often they carry <b>banderoles</b> with a quotation from their writings, and they may point to Christ, as the foretold Messiah. [...] The inclusion of kings and prophets was also an assertion of the inclusion and relevance in the biblical canon of books that some groups had rejected in the past.|$|R

On the pilaster dividing the Sassetti Chapel from the subsequent one is a painted grisaille statue of David. In the vault of the chapel are the four Sibyls, surrounded by flaming aureoles and holding out <b>banderoles</b> describing their prophetic role as assigned them by Virgil::Hec teste Virgil Magnus, in ultima autem etate;:Invisibile verbum palapabitur germinabit.Only {{the faces of the}} Sibyls are attributed to Ghirlandaio; the bodies were probably executed by his workshop.|$|R
5000|$|The Master of the <b>Banderoles</b> (active c. 1450-75) was an {{anonymous}} engraver who {{is thought to}} have worked in the northern Netherlands, perhaps in Geldern or Overijssel. He is named for his use of [...] "banderoles", or speech scrolls in his prints. His technique has been characterized as [...] "crude" [...] and [...] "clumsy", and most of the 130 engravings attributed to him are copies after other artists such as Master E.
