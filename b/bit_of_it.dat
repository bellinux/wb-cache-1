5|$|Back in Arendelle, Anna (who has {{woken up}} from the spell) tried to track down a device known as a wishing star, which will {{have the power to}} bring her and Kristoff to {{wherever}} Elsa is. It was apparently the necklace Elsa had given Anna long ago, Elsa using it to bring Anna and Kristoff to Storybrooke. However, the Spell of Shattered Sight had already begun, and the only ones immune to it were Elsa, Emma, and Anna (Anna because it was already used on her a while ago). Tracking down a note written by Elsa and Anna's mother right before her death, the three bring it to Ingrid. It reads that Gerda forgave Ingrid for all that had transpired and still loved her, Ingrid realizing this was what the prophecy meant by regaining her sister's love. Realizing {{there is no point in}} killing the town now, the Snow Queen kills herself using the mirror, which deactivates the curse, though a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> remained in Storybrooke, reinstating the town line, making it impossible to return to town if you are to leave it.|$|E

500|$|In December 1994, Antestor {{recorded}} {{their first}} full-length album titled Martyrium. Arctic Serenades Records was originally supposed to release that album, {{but because of}} unknown reasons that never happened, and the band tried to get another label to release the album. American-based label Morphine Records would subsequently distribute bootleg copies of the album in 1997. In an interview, the drummer Armoth said: [...] "...we were in contact with a label called Morphine Records. But that was about signing a deal for the Martyrium album. But we never signed a contract but that guy, Burrito, made several promotapes and sold every <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> illegally 'cause he didn't have a contract." [...] However, the tape copies circulated in up to fifth generation copies and their audience grew fast. Martyrium was the last album that emphasized the band's death/doom direction.|$|E

500|$|In 1985 Dylan sang on USA for Africa's famine relief single [...] "We Are the World". He {{also joined}} Artists United Against Apartheid {{providing}} vocals for their single [...] "Sun City". On July 13, 1985, he {{appeared at the}} climax at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia. Backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, he performed a ragged version of [...] "Hollis Brown", his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: [...] "I hope {{that some of the}} money... maybe they can just take a little <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> maybe... one or two million, maybe... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks." [...] His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire Willie Nelson to organize a series of events, Farm Aid, to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.|$|E
500|$|Although edibility for C.ruber has {{not been}} officially documented, its foul smell would dissuade most people from eating it. [...] In general, stinkhorn {{mushrooms}} are considered edible when still in the egg stage, and are even considered delicacies {{in some parts of}} Europe and Asia, where they are pickled raw and sold in markets as [...] "devil's eggs". An 1854 report provides a cautionary tale to those considering consuming the mature fruit body. Dr. F. Peyre Porcher, of Charleston, South Carolina, described an account of poisoning caused by the mushroom: [...] "A young person having eaten a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> after six hours suffered from a painful tension of the lower stomach, and violent convulsions. He lost the use of his speech, and fell into a state of stupor, which lasted for forty-eight hours. After taking an emetic he threw up a fragment of the mushroom, with two worms, and mucus, tinged with blood. Milk, oil, and emollient fomentations, were then employed with success." ...|$|E
500|$|Labour went on {{to suffer}} {{significant}} losses, both in the 2015 UK general election, and the 2016 Scottish Parliament election. In Glasgow, where the party had traditionally enjoyed strong support, both elections produced a result in which every Labour held constituency was lost to the SNP, while in 2016 the Conservatives overtook Labour as the second largest party at Holyrood. Lamont lost her Glasgow Pollok seat to the SNP's Humza Yousaf, who secured it with a majority of 6,484, but {{she was one of}} four Labour candidates elected to the Glasgow regional list, where she was joined by Sarwar, James Kelly and Pauline McNeill. In response to the results, Lamont suggested Labour needed to understand the reasons behind it, and suggested that the 2014 referendum could be partially responsible. [...] "A <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> I think, is still the referendum, the Yes/No is the divide in people’s minds rather than the politics of taxation, investing in public services against a low tax economy and so on." ...|$|E

500|$|The makeup {{time for}} the Borg {{expanded}} from the single hour needed for television to five hours, {{in addition to the}} 30minutes necessary to get into costume and 90minutes to remove the makeup {{at the end of the}} day. While Westmore estimated that a fully staffed production would have around 50 makeup artists, First Contact had to make do with fewer than ten people involved in preparation, and at most 20 artists a day. Despite the long hours, Westmore's teams began to be more creative with the prosthetics even as they decreased their preparation times. [...] "They were using two tubes, and then they were using three tubes, and then they were sticking tubes in the ears and up the nose," [...] Westmore explained. [...] "And we were using a very gooey caramel coloring, maybe using a little <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but by the time we got to the end of the movie we had the stuff dripping down the side of [...] faces—it looked like they were leaking oil!

500|$|The {{producers}} of Enough wanted Lopez {{to write a}} new song for the film. According to Lopez, writing a song is something that cannot be forced; [...] "It kinda just has to happen". While on their honeymoon in October 2001, Cris Judd played Lopez a melody that he had written on the piano. She thought that the melody was [...] "really beautiful" [...] {{and that it would}} make a [...] "wonderful song". Lopez felt that a [...] "little <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> sounded like the movie, a little haunting". When she heard the melody, Lopez said to herself: [...] "I can write something to that right now. And we can use it in Enough". She then began to think about the film and the character that she portrays and what she had been through. In addition, she also thought about the things that she had gone through in her own life. According to Lopez, it was easy to be inspired by the melody Judd had written, [...] "and just kind of that grateful feeling, to just be here [...] And keeping it simple. Because life can get so crazy and everything. And then you realize, it's all just kinda about the simplicity of being here, and being healthy. And being alive. So that's where the song came from." ...|$|E

After Symons heard the demos Ford had recorded, the band started demoing new material in early 2007 and released Promise Lands, their fourth studio album on 31 March 2008 through Goldhawk Recordings/Cooking Vinyl. Ford described the album as [...] "a very sad record. There are <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> that are quite raw, <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> that are quite difficult to listen to for the same reason they were quite hard to write. It’s probably the most personal thing that we’ve done".|$|R
2500|$|The {{origins of}} the song came when Thomas visited Allen Toussaint's parents' house in New Orleans. Sat at the piano Toussaint {{composed}} many of his early songs. Toussaint later stated [...] "I remember when I was writing 'It's Raining,' she was sitting right there, and it began raining outside," [...] he said. [...] "I just wrote that song then and handed it {{over to her and}} sung a little <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> just to show her the melody, and it fit like a gown." [...] Toussaint captured solitude that remains possible in a depths of a rain sodden night.|$|E

He split every slab, cut every post and wallplate and rafter himself, with a man to help him at odd times; and after the frame was up, and the bark on the roof, he camped underneath and finished every <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> — chimney, flooring, doors, windows, and partitions — by himself.' ...|$|E
2500|$|After Ford {{graduated}} from Santa Monica High School, {{he began working}} in small theatre groups. While in high school, he took odd jobs, including working for Will Rogers, who taught him horsemanship. Ford later commented {{that his father had}} no objection to his growing interest in acting, but told him, [...] "It's all right for you to try to act, if you learn something else first. Be able to take a car apart and put it together. Be able to build a house, every <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Then you'll always have something." [...] Ford heeded the advice and during the 1950s, when he was one of Hollywood's most popular actors, he regularly worked on plumbing, wiring, and air conditioning at home. At times, he worked as a roofer and installer of plate-glass windows.|$|E

Alexander Carmichael wrote {{that there was a}} feast featuring lamb, and that formerly this lamb was sacrificed. In 1769, Thomas Pennant wrote that, in Perthshire, a caudle made from eggs, butter, oatmeal and milk was cooked on the bonfire. Some of the mixture was poured on the ground as a libation. Everyone present would then take an oatmeal cake, called the bannoch Bealltainn or [...] "Beltane bannock". A <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was offered to the spirits to protect their livestock (one bit to protect the horses, one bit to protect the sheep, and so forth) and a bit was offered to each of the animals that might harm their livestock (one to the fox, one to the eagle, and so forth). Afterwards, they would drink the caudle.|$|E

Norman Fowler, then a reporter for The Times, interviewed Powell during the election and asked him what the biggest issue was: [...] "I expected to be told something about the cost of living but not a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "Immigration," [...] replied Powell.

2500|$|He is {{mentioned}} again {{later that year}} at Edessa. The local citizens were attempting to pay ransom for the safe return of prisoners held at Antioch. Bouzes prevented them from doing so. [...] "Chosroes ...wished to sell off all the captives from Antioch. And when the citizens of Edessa learned of this, they displayed an unheard-of zeal. For {{there was not a}} person who did not bring ransom for the captives and deposit it in the sanctuary according to the measure of his possessions. And there were some who even exceeded their proportionate amount in so doing. For the harlots took off all the adornment which they wore on their persons, and threw it down there, and any farmer who was in want of plate or of money, but who had an ass or a sheep, brought this to the sanctuary with great zeal. So there was collected an exceedingly great amount of gold and silver and money in other forms, but not a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was given for ransom. For Bouzes happened to be present there, and he took in hand to prevent the transaction, expecting that this would bring him some great gain. Therefore Chosroes moved forward, taking with him all the captives." ...|$|E
