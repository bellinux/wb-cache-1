5|$|Fleming {{developed}} the James Bond character more in Goldfinger {{than in the}} previous six novels, presenting him as a more complex individual, whilst also bringing out a theme of Bond as Saint George.

5|$|A {{group in}} Cambridge, which {{met at the}} White Horse tavern from the mid-1520s and became known as Little Germany, soon became influential. Its members {{included}} Robert Barnes, Hugh Latimer, John Frith and Thomas Bilney—all eventually burned as heretics. Cranmer's change of mind, borne partly by his membership of the team negotiating for the annulment, finally came through his stay with Andreas Osiander in Nuremberg in 1532. (Cranmer also secretly married Osiander's niece). Even then the position was complicated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Lutherans were not in favour of the annulment. Cranmer (and Henry) felt obliged to seek assistance from Strasbourg and Basel, which brought him {{into contact with the}} more radical ideas associated with Zwingli.|$|E
5|$|ASL {{originated}} in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact.

Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of oral language to sign language, compounded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that ASL is often glossed in English {{due to the lack}} of a standard writing system.|$|E
