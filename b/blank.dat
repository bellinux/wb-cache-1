40|$|Abstract. Fine-blanking with {{negative}} clearance {{is a kind}} of fine <b>blanking</b> processes. The punch size of fine-blanking {{with negative}} clearance is larger than the die size. The paper does lots of simulations for the changes of <b>blanking</b> force in fine-blanking with negative clearance and common <b>blanking</b> by DEFORM software, and the <b>blanking</b> force curves are gained by these experiments. The changing principle of <b>blanking</b> force and internal material is obtained through the simulation and experiments. The result shows that simulation <b>blanking</b> force of AISI- 1045 is lager than the actual <b>blanking</b> force. According to the curves derived from experiments, we can see that the maximum <b>blanking</b> force of fine-blanking with negative clearance is higher than common <b>blanking</b> force. Compared with fine-blanking with negative clearance, the common <b>blanking</b> force reduces faster after the <b>blanking</b> force reaches maximum value. The experiment result shows that the force of fine-blanking with negative clearance under a smaller <b>blanking</b> clearance is a bit bigger than the force of common <b>blanking</b> force, and the <b>blanking</b> quality of fine-blanking with negative clearance is much better than that of common <b>blanking.</b> Cracks can be closed effectively by the special squeeze forming in fine <b>blanking</b> with negative clearance. Then, the crack can not expand continuously, and the bonding force is enhanced. The squeeze forming can restrain intergranular deformation and reduce the damage. However, the stretch forming easily leads to the inner crack and defect of materials. By means of the analysis on experimental curves, the paper further studies the changing law of fine-blanking with negative clearance <b>blanking</b> force...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Machining {{experiments}} of fine-blanking {{with negative}} clearance {{show that the}} <b>blanking</b> force {{is very different from}} ordinary <b>blanking</b> in different <b>blanking</b> stages. Studying on the <b>blanking</b> force size of fine-blanking with negative clearance in different <b>blanking</b> stages is a very important significance for studying die wear and analyzing the state of material stress-strain. Firstly, numerical simulation and stress state analysis of the fine-blanking with negative clearance are carried out, with DEFORM-metal forming finite element analysis software. Afterward the relationship curve of <b>blanking</b> force and stroke are measured, and the <b>blanking</b> force with different <b>blanking</b> stages of fine-blanking with negative clearance is analyzed by the simulation and the experiment. The analysis result shows that the simulation <b>blanking</b> force is bigger than the experimental result (error about 15 %), but the <b>blanking</b> force variation tendency is accordant. while the punch pushes down within 0. 1 mm, the <b>blanking</b> force changes quickly. The metal sheet will enter into the state of plastic deformation after the <b>blanking</b> force reaching maximum value. Along with the punch continues to move down, the area of shear zone is decrescent so that the <b>blanking</b> force inches down, and the <b>blanking</b> force reaches a certain value in the place of <b>blanking</b> allowance value finally. With punch pushing the metal sheet to enter the plastic state and punch downward the place of the allowance value, the metal sheet sustained the big <b>blanking</b> force all the time as well as the deformation zone material keeps the plastic deformation. The research result provides theoretic reference and the experimental data for the practice application of fine-blanking with negative clearance, and has instructive significance and reference value to mould design...|$|R

30|$|To {{suppress}} {{the effect of}} impulsive noise on an OFDM receiver, an interference mitigation method based on pulse <b>blanking</b> is first proposed in [4 â€“ 6]. However, when using this method to an actual system, two problems should be considered, the threshold of pulse <b>blanking</b> and the compensation of inter-carrier interference (ICI) caused by pulse <b>blanking.</b> To calculate the <b>blanking</b> threshold, an optimal threshold of pulse <b>blanking</b> is derived based on an expression for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the <b>blanking</b> nonlinearity [7]. With maximizing the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) criterion, an adaptive <b>blanking</b> threshold for the OFDM receiver is also proposed in [8]. To eliminate the ICI caused by pulse <b>blanking,</b> an iterative reconstructing and subtracting ICI method is proposed in [9, 10], and a frequency-domain ICI compensation scheme based on finite impulse response equalizer is proposed in [11].|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Being an {{important}} <b>blanking</b> parameter, the <b>blanking</b> allowance of fine-blanking with negative clearance {{has a direct}} relationship {{with the quality of}} work piece and ejector force. The full process of fine-blanking with negative clearance for ASTM- 1022 in different <b>blanking</b> allowances is simulated through the finite element analysis software DEFORM- 2 D, then the ejector force under different <b>blanking</b> allowances is measured through the experiment of fine-blanking with negative clearance. Based on the analysis of the ejector force, the proportion of burnish band and the work piece fracture, the following conclusions are summarized. The size of <b>blanking</b> allowance is not related with the <b>blanking</b> force with the sheet entering plastic state and the maximum <b>blanking</b> force, and is only related with the ejector force. When the value of the <b>blanking</b> allowance is between 0. 1 mm and 0. 3 mm, the friction force between the punch-die and the sheet affects ejector force, and the ejector force is not related with the mechanical properties of material. When the value of the <b>blanking</b> allowance is between 0. 5 mm and 0. 8 mm, with the <b>blanking</b> allowance increasing, the ejector force increases rapidly...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} advancements of {{the conventional}} <b>blanking</b> nonlinearity for OFDM based systems, in the following referred to as advanced <b>blanking</b> nonlinearity. <b>Blanking</b> is a common measure for mitigating impulsive interference which often occurs in wireless communication systems. Although the <b>blanking</b> nonlinearity removes impulsive interference reliably, it possesses various drawbacks for OFDM based systems. In particular, {{the choice of the}} <b>blanking</b> threshold, in order to decide whether a received sample is <b>blanked,</b> is a critical issue. We present an algorithm for determining the optimal <b>blanking</b> threshold so as to maximize the signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio after <b>blanking.</b> Another drawback is that the entire received signal is discarded during a <b>blanking</b> interval despite the fact that {{only a fraction of the}} spectrum of the OFDM signal might be affected by interference. We show, how <b>blanking</b> can be limited to sub-carriers which are actually affected by interference. Further, we show how these measures can be combined and how a priori information, obtained in an iterative loop, can be incorporated into the proposed scheme. Simulation results incorporating realistic channel and interference models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme...|$|R
