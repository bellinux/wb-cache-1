5|$|Diệm's {{government}} formulated procedural regulations ostensibly {{designed to}} ensure results and ballots were correctly accounted for and to prevent election fraud. In reality however, the votes were counted without independent supervision, which resulted in Diệm being credited with 98.2% of the vote. The prime minister tallied 605,025 votes in Saigon, although only 450,000 voters were registered in the capital. Diệm's tally exceeded the registration numbers in other districts. French newspapers claimed that {{only half of the}} registered voters in Saigon had actually voted, and that the rest had boycotted the election, implying that more than 60% of the votes in the capital were not authentic. Defenders of Diệm claim this was due to recently arrived, mostly Catholic, refugees from North Vietnam who voted without being enrolled, rather than large-scale <b>ballot</b> <b>stuffing.</b>|$|E

25|$|Parliamentary {{elections}} {{held during}} Saakashvili's second term were condemned by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe election monitoring mission for being marred by <b>ballot</b> <b>stuffing,</b> violence against opposition campaigners, uncritical {{coverage of the}} president and his party from the state-controlled media, and public officials openly campaigning for the president's party.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the dawn}} of the {{internet}} age, online voting has again led to <b>ballot</b> <b>stuffing.</b> In 1999, Chris Nandor, a Red Sox fan, utilized a simple computer program to vote for Nomar Garciaparra over 39,000 times. Upon discovery, MLB disallowed the votes. Major League Baseball assures that they have taken precautions to guard against this.|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} {{was characterized by}} lack of security, low voter turnout and low awareness of the people about the election and election process and widespread <b>ballot</b> <b>stuffing,</b> intimidation, and other electoral fraud. A second round run-off vote, announced under heavy U.S. and ally pressure, was originally scheduled for 7 November 2009, but it was cancelled after Abdullah refused to participate, and Hamid Karzai was declared President of Afghanistan for another 5-year term.|$|E
25|$|When the {{election}} was eventually investigated by the Independent Review Commission (IREC) on the 2007 Elections chaired by Justice Johann Kriegler, {{it was found that}} there were too many electoral malpractices from several regions perpetrated by all the contesting parties to conclusively establish which candidate won the December 2007 Presidential elections. Such malpractices included widespread bribery, vote buying, intimidation and <b>ballot</b> <b>stuffing</b> by both sides, as well as incompetence from the Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK), which was shortly thereafter disbanded by the new Parliament.|$|E
25|$|On September 15, 2009, the foreign-dominated ECC {{ordered a}} recount of 2,600, or 10%, of the country's 26,000 polling {{stations}} – {{many of them}} in southern Afghanistan – a move expected to strip votes away from incumbent President Hamid Karzai. Because many of those polling stations had substantially higher turnouts than average, possibly the result of <b>ballot</b> <b>stuffing,</b> more than 10% of the vote could be affected. With the September 12 partial results showing Karzai at 54.3% of the votes, just 4.3 points above the 50% threshold, the ECC-ordered recount could potentially force a run-off election.|$|E
5000|$|In Nelson W. Aldrich Jr.'s Old Money, {{he states}} that [...] "envy is so {{integral}} and painful {{a part of what}} animates human behavior in market societies that many people have forgotten the full meaning of the word, simplifying it into one of the symptoms of desire. It is that (a symptom of desire), which is why it flourishes in market societies: democracies of desire, they might be called, with money for <b>ballots,</b> <b>stuffing</b> permitted. But envy is more or less than desire. It begins with the almost frantic sense of emptiness inside oneself, as if the pump of one's heart were sucking on air. One has to be blind to perceive the emptiness, of course, but that's what envy is, a selective blindness. Invidia, Latin for envy, translates as [...] "nonsight," [...] and Dante had the envious plodding along under cloaks of lead, their eyes sewn shut with leaden wire. What they are blind to is what they have, God-given and humanly nurtured, in themselves".|$|R
50|$|At {{least three}} members of the project have been taken in for {{questioning}} by the NYPD on more than one occasion.

25|$|Beginning in the 1870s, {{politics}} and corruption of Tammany Hall, a political machine supported by Irish immigrants infiltrated the NYPD, {{which was used}} as political tool, with positions awarded by politicians to loyalists.

25|$|The {{election}} year of 1919, saw the political winds of fortune blowing {{strongly in the}} direction of the GOP, not only in Maryland but nationally as well. Convinced and initially backed by Kelly, Nice resigned as assistant State's Attorney and cast his hat into the gubernatorial race. However, Harry Nice then made a costly mistake. In speeches during the campaign, Nice promised to clean up the dirty underworld politics of the Democrats and their political bosses and ensure elections were fair and open to everyone. In this time period <b>ballot</b> <b>stuffing,</b> voter fraud and outright voter intimidation were common place, especially in large cities like Baltimore.|$|E
25|$|Candidates {{and analysts}} {{predicted}} that bribery to secure votes would be rampant. A March 2012 poll by Research & Branding Group showed that 66% {{of the respondents}} believed that the election would not be fair, 18% disagreed with that. Following the elections the parties Fatherland, UDAR and Svoboda filled in an appeal at the Central Election Commission of Ukraine (CVK) with allegations of fraud in 13 simple-majority constituencies. Irregularities in the elections like cases of <b>ballot</b> <b>stuffing,</b> carousel voting, suspiciously high voter turnout and bribed voters have been reported. On 30 October 2012 the Committee of Voters of Ukraine stated that the elections saw {{a record number of}} cases of bribery of voters. They also insisted the elections had not brought the country closer to democratic standards. And that although there were no grounds to believe that the violations that were reported on polling day could affect the election results, the election results could seriously be affected by violations during the counting of votes.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the federal}} law passed in 2004, heads of federal subjects, {{including}} the governor of Saint Petersburg, were nominated by the President of Russia and approved by local legislatures. Should the legislature disapprove the nominee, the President could dissolve it. The former governor, Valentina Matviyenko, was approved {{according to the new}} system in December 2006. She was the only woman governor in the whole of Russia until her resignation on August 22, 2011. Matviyenko stood for elections as member of the Regional Council of Saint Petersburg and won comprehensively with allegations of rigging and <b>ballot</b> <b>stuffing</b> by the opposition. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has already backed her for the position of Speaker to the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and her election qualifies her for that job. After her resignation, Georgy Poltavchenko was appointed as the new acting governor the same day. In 2012, following passage of a new federal law, restoring direct elections of heads of federal subjects, the city charter was again amended to provide for direct elections of governor.|$|E

500|$|In April 2009, Poole {{was voted}} the world's most {{influential}} person of 2008 by an open Internet poll conducted by Time magazine.

500|$|On June 11, 1957, Musial {{tied the}} NL record for {{consecutive}} games played with his 822nd, a streak that {{began on the}} last day of the 1951 season. Despite <b>ballot</b> <b>stuffing</b> by Cincinnati Reds fans, he was selected and played in the All-Star Game held at Sportsman's Park. When he overextended his swing while batting during a game on August 23, Musial fractured a bone in his left shoulder socket and tore muscles over his collarbone. He was unable to play again until September 8, ending his consecutive games-played streak at 895. He finished 1957 as Sports Illustrateds [...] "Sportsman of the Year".|$|E
500|$|Paul filed {{a lawsuit}} on November 19 contesting the {{election}} results, alleging that Shibell's Cowboy supporters Iike Clanton, Curly Bill Brocius, and Frank McLaury had cooperated in <b>ballot</b> <b>stuffing.</b> Chief Justice of Arizona C.G.W. French ruled in Paul's favor in late January 1881, but Shibell appealed. His lawsuit was finally resolved by April 1881. The election commission found that a mysterious [...] "Henry Johnson" [...] was responsible for certifying the ballots. This {{turned out to be}} James Johnson, the same James K. Johnson who had been shooting up Allen Street the night Marshal White was killed. Moreover, he was the same Johnson who testified at Curly Bill's preliminary hearing after he shot Fred White. James Johnson later testified for Bud Paul in the election hearing and said that the ballots had been left in the care of Phin Clanton. None of the witnesses during the election hearing reported on ballots being cast by dogs. The recount found Paul had 402 votes and Shibell had 354. Sixty-two were kept from a closer examination. Paul was declared the winner of the Pima County sheriff election, but by that time, the election was a moot point. Paul could not replace Behan with Earp because on January 1, 1881, Cochise County was created out of the eastern portion of Pima County.|$|E
5000|$|Bracondale was {{the name}} of a former Toronto suburb that was annexed by the city in 1909; and north of Davenport Road, {{constituted}} the northern part of what eventually became the provincial electoral district. It was part of the northwestern expansion of the city that included Wychwood Park, and the City of West Toronto (now known as The Junction). The constituency was first contested during Ontario's 17th general election on 1 December 1926. Arthur Russell Nesbitt, was elected its first Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). He was a member of Ontario Conservative Party. The constituency's first Ontario Liberal MLA was Lionel Conacher, a famous Canadian athlete that retired from the National Hockey League to start a career in politics. He was elected on 6 October 1937 in a very close race with the constituency's incumbent MLA, Nesbitt. Nesbitt claimed that two ballot boxes were missing and one was filled with fraudulent ballots. [...] The constituency's returning officer was arrested, and denied bail because he had a quantity of <b>ballots</b> <b>stuffed</b> in his pockets. [...] Soon after Conacher was elected as an MLA, the legislature changed the designation for its members to Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) in 1938.|$|R
25|$|The 37th All-Star Game in 1985 {{marked the}} first time that honorary captains were {{selected}} for each team. The Game also brought forth the notion of fan balloting of the starting lineup (already adopted in the National Basketball Association and by this time had returned, following a hiatus brought on by <b>ballot</b> box <b>stuffing,</b> to MLB; the NFL gave the fans the vote in the 1990s), as the game was suffering from having little media coverage. The idea came into fruition the following year.|$|R
50|$|Reports of violence, voter {{intimidation}} and <b>ballot</b> box <b>stuffing</b> began coming in {{shortly after the}} polling stations opened. The biggest problem, however, was the voter lists prepared by the Georgian government. Mikhail Saakashvili was among tens of thousands who were {{denied the right to}} vote. His name, along with names of many thousands across the country, was missing from the voter list prepared by the Georgian government. Entire neighborhoods were mysteriously removed from the voter list in the areas where opposition was likely to do well.|$|R
