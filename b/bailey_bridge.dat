5|$|Sir Donald Bailey, a civil engineer, {{developed}} the <b>Bailey</b> <b>bridge</b> {{while he worked}} in Christchurch during the Second World War. Bailey lived in Christchurch after he retired in 1966 {{until his death in}} 1985. Former England football international and Liverpool player Jamie Redknapp attended Twynham School when his father, Harry Redknapp, managed A.F.C. Bournemouth. Another footballer, retired Arsenal and Scotland goalkeeper Bob Wilson, has a home near the town centre.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{design on}} {{the first stage of}} the freeway, from the Narrows Bridge to Sutherland Street at the {{northern}} edge of the city, began in 1960, and took several years to be completed. The design included a complex interchange at the Narrows Bridge that was to be built on reclaimed land that was mostly soft mud. Ground improvement works, which included the installations of 43,000 sand drains, began in 1964; demolition of buildings in the freeway's path commenced in 1965. The freeway was completed in three sections, under three separate contracts. Construction on the central section from Mount Street to Wellington Street started on 18 November 1966, following a groundbreaking ceremony conducted by Premier David Brand. It was opened to traffic two years later, connected to the Narrows Bridge via a temporary <b>Bailey</b> <b>Bridge</b> over Mounts Bay Road. The new road carried up to 1400 vehicles per hour during peak hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{navigation}} then {{passes to}} the east of Southampton Airport, while further east is the river channel and the Itchen Valley Country Park. Between the two waterways is Decoy Covert, a small wood which contained a duck decoy. The lock nearby is called Decoy Pond Lock, below which is Sandy Lock. There is little water in this section, since its main supply has been cut off, and although there are springs along this section, the channel is periodically blocked where occupation bridges have been replaced by earth embankments. Sandy Lock has much barbed wire in it, possibly dumped when the wartime defences of the airport were dismantled. The final lock on this section is Mans Bridge Lock, shortly after the modern crossing by the M27 motorway. The cut then rejoins the main river, and passes under the A27 road. The current bridge was constructed in 1975, and replaced a <b>bailey</b> <b>bridge</b> erected during the Second World War. Just below it is a single arched stone bridge dating from the early nineteenth century, which was the original course of the road. It has been restored and is used as a footbridge.|$|E

50|$|By 2007 {{there were}} two <b>Bailey</b> <b>bridges</b> {{employed}} at the site, one for traffic {{from east to west}} and the other for the opposite direction. However, in 2007 a modern concrete span was completed and as a consequence one of the <b>Bailey</b> <b>bridges</b> was dismantled and the other left intact for use in emergency.|$|R
5000|$|Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery {{wrote in}} 1947: <b>Bailey</b> <b>Bridging</b> made an immense {{contribution}} towards ending World War II. As {{far as my}} own operations were concerned, with the eighth Army in Italy and with the 21 Army Group in North West Europe, I could never have maintained the speed and tempo of forward movement without large supplies of <b>Bailey</b> <b>Bridging.</b>|$|R
5|$|Three {{troops from}} B Squadron tried to probe Casoli but failed since the bridges {{over the river}} had been destroyed; a foot patrol formed from the {{squadron}} was sent. C Squadron advanced forward of Elici after it was abandoned by the Axis. The New Zealand Engineers constructed a <b>Bailey</b> <b>bridge</b> over the river, allowing B Squadron to cross on 1 December. The squadron attempted to capture Guardiagrele the next day but was repulsed by anti-tank gunfire. Two troops from C Squadron entered Castelfrentano, joining the tanks of the 18th Armoured Regiment. On 4 December, A and B Squadrons attempted {{to find a way}} through Frisa, working to the right for an easier approach towards Arielli. The division was to attack on the Orsogna road and contain the 26th Panzer Division. On 1 January 1944, B Squadron was sent forward as infantry to take over the sector between San Eusanio and Guardiagrele. It was relieved on 19 January and the regiment moved back over the Sangro to another sector.|$|E

25|$|Christchurch {{has had a}} long {{relationship}} with the military and Ministry of Defence. The Barracks were built by Lord Tregonwell in 1794 to house troops to defend the south coast from the threat of invasion by Napoleon Bonaparte. Once this threat had passed, it was used by mounted troops who patrolled the nearby coastline in an attempt to combat smuggling. Parts of the original barracks still exist including the guard house, the stable block and the officer's mess. The Barracks later (1919) became the Military Experimental Engineering Establishment (Originally the Experimental Bridging Company of Royal Engineers) where Sir Donald Bailey designed and built his famous bridge. In 1970 Military Experimental Establishment (MEXE) merged with the Fighting Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (FVRDE) at Chertsey to form the Military Vehicles Experimental Establishment (MVEE) which closed in the 1994. The site became a housing estate and retail park in 1997. A measure {{of the success of the}} <b>Bailey</b> <b>Bridge</b> can be made from its production figures. Between 1942 and 1945, over 490,000 tons of <b>Bailey</b> <b>Bridge</b> were produced. It is estimated that if all the panels produced during WWII were put together they would reach from Christchurch to Leningrad.|$|E
25|$|The {{disaster}} {{prompted the}} development of a second major crossing of the Derwent River near the location of the temporary <b>Bailey</b> <b>Bridge</b> at Risdon Cove, 10km {{to the north of the}} Tasman Bridge. With Federal Government funding, the $49 million Bowen Bridge was opened on 23 February 1984 by newly elected Prime Minister Bob Hawke. The Bridge was named after Lieutenant John Bowen who had established the first British settlement at Risdon Cove in 1803, approximately 500 metres from the eastern landing of the new bridge.|$|E
25|$|The river can be crossed on foot or bicycle by {{a public}} {{footbridge}} upstream from The Harbour Inn, which gives access {{to the village of}} Walberswick. This bridge, known as the <b>Bailey</b> <b>Bridge,</b> is based on the footings of the original iron Southwold Railway swing bridge. It replaced that bridge, which contained a central swinging section to allow the passage of wherries and other shipping, and which was largely demolished at the start of World War II as a part of precautions against German invasion.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, {{the pier}} was encased in {{barbed wire and}} the army took it over, {{camouflage}} netting was manufactured in the pavilion by local women and the tram was last used in June 1939 to carry army stores. Steamers were requisitioned for war work, including the PS Medway Queen which became a minesweeper and Little Ship. In June 1940 the army blew up two sections of the pier between the pavilion and pier head to prevent enemy landing, then crossed the gaps with <b>Bailey</b> <b>bridges</b> in the 1940s. It {{has been suggested that}} the gaps and <b>Bailey</b> <b>bridges</b> weakened the pier structure and permitted the storm damage of 11 January 1978. In 1947, war-damage compensation of £21,924.15s.1d was received by the council, but this was not enough for full repair, and priority was given to the Grand Pavilion, substructure and decking. <b>Bailey</b> <b>bridges</b> had to be used to span the gaps so that by 1947 the pleasure steamers were calling at the pier again.|$|R
25|$|Assigned to 11th (East Africa) Division, {{it moved}} east from Imphal to Tamu {{and down the}} 'pestilential' Kabaw Valley to the Chindwin to meet 5th (Indian) Division at Kalemyo. 11th EA Division with its AA support then moved north up the Chindwin to Kalewa, an {{important}} ferry centre {{which was to be}} the crossing site for XXXIII Corps. A bridgehead was secured and the engineers began building a 1100-foot <b>Bailey</b> <b>bridge</b> on pontoons. Japanese air attacks had been slight up to this point, but now their aircraft made a determined attempt to knock out the bridge. Intense concentrations of fire by 52nd and the other AA units broke up the attacks, destroyed six aircraft, and ensured that the bridge remained intact.|$|E
25|$|After leaving {{downtown}} Mount Vernon, {{the freeway}} intersects SR 538, which serves the Skagit Valley College and Clear Lake (via SR 9). After the interchange, the highway crosses the Skagit River, where {{part of the}} bridge collapsed on May 23, 2013, leaving {{a gap in the}} highway until a temporary <b>bailey</b> <b>bridge</b> span was built and opened on June 19. In September it was replaced with a more permanent span. On {{the other side of the}} river it continues north through Burlington. After passing the Cascade Mall, I-5 intersects SR 20, which goes west to Anacortes (via SR 20 Spur), Deception Pass, Whidbey Island, and Discovery Bay and SR 20 goes east to Okanogan, Omak, and Newport. The freeway also intersects SR 11, which serves Edison, Bow, Samish Island, and Bellingham.|$|E
25|$|The {{assault was}} ordered for 19.00 on 25 August, with a {{reinforced}} brigade crossing on a two-battalion front, one {{either side of}} the destroyed road bridge. While 15th (Kent) GHQ Troops RE ferried the assault troops across, and other RE units prepared to build a heavy <b>Bailey</b> <b>bridge,</b> 43rd Divisional Engineers had the task of constructing a Class 9 Folding Boat Equipment (FBE) bridge on rafts. It emerged that DUKW amphibious vehicles could not enter the river, so the assault had to be carried out with powered storm boats, until 260 Fd Co had bulldozed ramps in the river bank. 553rd and 204th Fd Companies began work on the bridge after an approach had been bulldozed under intense machine gun and mortar fire. Close support rafts built by 553rd Fd Co were taken over next morning by 15th (Kent) GHQTRE to continue the ferrying operation and support the hard-pressed assault troops on the far side.|$|E
5|$|The {{shattered}} Arnhem {{road bridge}} was briefly {{replaced by a}} succession of <b>Bailey</b> <b>bridges</b> before being rebuilt in the same style as the original. It was renamed John Frostbrug (literally John Frost Bridge) on 17 December 1977.|$|R

25|$|On 14 April the {{division}} crossed the River Lethe at Cloppenburg, where 204th Fd Co incurred severe casualties bridging the river under shellfire. The following day {{the division}} decisively crushed the last organised counter-attack against its troops. For {{the rest of}} the month 43rd Division protected the left flank of XXX Corps' drive towards Bremen. On 30 April the 43rd Division closed up to the small River Wörpe at Grasburg, which the leading infantry crossed while 204th Fd Co repaired the road bridge. The next day the advance was held up by numerous large craters in the causeway carrying the road, each of which had to be bridged under fire from Self-propelled guns, which was not complete until 3 May. On 4 May the division's infantry crossed the Oste-Hamme Canal by a footbridge, while 553 Fd Co built a Class 40 <b>Bailey</b> <b>Bridge</b> {{before the end of the}} day. The division's further advance to capture Bremerhaven the next day was forestalled by the German surrender at Lüneburg Heath.|$|E
25|$|The sudden {{capture of}} a {{bridge across the}} Rhine was front-page news in American newspapers. The {{unexpected}} availability of a bridgehead {{on the eastern side}} of the Rhine more than two weeks in advance of the planned crossing allowed Allied high commander Dwight Eisenhower to alter his plans to end the war. The Allies were able to rapidly transport five divisions across the Rhine into the Ruhr, Germany's industrial heartland. The bridge had endured months of aircraft bombing, direct artillery hits, near misses, and deliberate demolition attempts. It finally collapsed at 3:00 pm on 17 March. Twenty-eight American engineers were killed and sixty-three were wounded. But by then U.S. Army combat engineers had finished building a tactical steel treadway bridge and a heavy duty pontoon bridge followed by a <b>Bailey</b> <b>bridge</b> across the Rhine. Over 25,000 troops crossed into Germany before the Americans broke out of the bridgehead on 25 March 1945. This was 18 days after the bridge had been captured. German and American military authorities agreed that capturing the bridge shortened the war. The Ludendorff Bridge was not rebuilt following World War II.|$|E
