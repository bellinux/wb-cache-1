2500|$|Organic and polymer {{photovoltaic}} (OPV) are {{a relatively}} new area of research. The tradition OPV cell structure layers consist of a semi-transparent electrode, electron <b>blocking</b> <b>layer,</b> tunnel junction, holes <b>blocking</b> <b>layer,</b> electrode, with the sun hitting the transparent electrode. OPV replaces silver with carbon as an electrode material lowering manufacturing cost and making them more environmentally friendly. OPV are flexible, low weight, and work well with roll-to roll manufacturing for mass production. OPV uses [...] "only abundant elements coupled to an extremely low embodied energy through very low processing temperatures using only ambient processing conditions on simple printing equipment enabling energy pay-back times". Current efficiencies range from 1–6.5%, however theoretical analyses show promise beyond 10% efficiency.|$|E
50|$|So far, most ETLs and HTLs {{consist of}} organic materials. Most organic {{electroluminescent}} materials favor injection and transport of holes rather than electrons. Thus, the electron-hole recombination generally occurs near the cathode, {{which could lead}} to the quenching of the exciton produced. In order to prevent the produced excitons or holes from approaching the cathode, a hole-blocking layer plays dual roles in blocking holes moving towards the cathode and transporting the electrons to the emitting QD layer. Tris-aluminium (Alq3), bathocuproine (BCP), and TAZ are the most commonly used hole-blocking materials. These materials can be used as both electron-transporting layer and hole <b>blocking</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Polymer {{solar cells}} usually consist of an electron- or hole-blocking layer {{on top of}} an indium tin oxide (ITO) {{conductive}} glass followed by electron donor and an electron acceptor (in the case of bulk heterojunction solar cells), a hole or electron <b>blocking</b> <b>layer,</b> and metal electrode on top. The nature and order of the blocking layers - as well as the nature of the metal electrode - depends on whether the cell follows a regular or an inverted device architecture. In an inverted cell, the electric charges exit the device in the opposite direction as in a normal device because the positive and negative electrodes are reversed. Inverted cells can utilize cathodes out of a more suitable material; inverted OPVs enjoy longer lifetimes than regularly structured OPVs, but they typically don’t reach efficiencies as high as regular OPVs.|$|E
30|$|Storage {{architecture}} agnostic Irrespective {{of storage}} networked virtualizations like SAN, NAS or DAS, ultimately I/Os are {{managed by the}} <b>block</b> <b>layer.</b> The <b>block</b> <b>layer</b> as shown in Fig.  1 resides towards the client in centralized storage management solutions like SAN, while {{in the case of}} NAS, it lies inside the NAS device. Therefore, any solution built in the <b>block</b> <b>layer</b> can be applied to any data-center storage infrastructure.|$|R
30|$|File system {{agnostic}} The <b>block</b> <b>layer</b> lies {{below the}} VFS {{and above the}} device driver. Operating at the <b>block</b> <b>layer</b> makes the solution independent of the file system layer above, enabling it with the flexibility to support multiple heterogeneous file systems simultaneously [8, 10].|$|R
40|$|The <b>block</b> <b>layered</b> space-time codes, {{with the}} intent of {{simultaneously}} achieving high coding gain and high code rate, have been suggested. These codes are based on the design principles of existing layered space-time codes and space-time block codes. The previously known concept of a layer has been modified to a <b>block</b> <b>layer</b> wherein a <b>block</b> <b>layer</b> has more than one antenna transmitting at the same instant and hence the name for this scheme. Each <b>block</b> <b>layer</b> incorporates Alamouti’s transmit diversity scheme which decreases the decoding complexity. Alamouti’s scheme is preferred as it is the simplest unique linear processing technique for achieving full diversity with two transmit antennas. The <b>block</b> <b>layers</b> are made transparent to each other by Diophantine approximation. The use of space-time codes improves the coding gain for the proposed code design scheme. This scheme has been implemented for four transmit antennas and four receive antennas but can easily be extended to any number of antennas depending on the code rate desired. The proposed codes achieve a normalized rate of 2 -symbol/s. Simulation results show that the <b>block</b> <b>layered</b> space-time codes outperform threaded algebraic space-time (TAST) codes, which is the best known layering scheme that achieves full-rate and full-diversity with arbitrary number of transmit and receive antennas, in certain scenarios.

30|$|Recently, we {{were able}} to show that the {{implementation}} of the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> in solid-state DSSCs is feasible: (Lellig et al. 2012). Electrical conductivity through the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> was validated by conductive scanning probe microscopy. The direct comparison of the novel hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> and the conventional compact TiO 2 film revealed that the conductivity of the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> increased by 32 %. The functionality of the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer,</b> i.e. the prevention of short-circuits, was verified by the implementation in solid-state DSSCs. In doing so, the efficiency of the device with the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> was increased from 0.35 to 1.27 % compared to an identical device omitting the <b>blocking</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} a dense TiO 2 <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> {{prepared}} using the sol-gel method {{on the performance of}} dye-sensitized solar cells was studied. The <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> formed directly on the working electrode, separated it from the electrolyte, and prevented the back transfer of electrons from the electrode to the electrolyte. The dye-sensitized solar cells were prepared with a working electrode of fluorine-doped tin oxide glass coated with a <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> of dense TiO 2, a dye-attached mesoporous TiO 2 film, and a nano-gel electrolyte, and a counter electrode of Pt-deposited FTO glass. The gel processing conditions and heat treatment temperature for <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> formation affected the morphology and performance of the cells, and their optimal values were determined. The introduction of the <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> increased the conversion efficiency of the cell by 7. 37 % for the cell without a <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> to 8. 55 % for the cell with a dense TiO 2 <b>blocking</b> <b>layer,</b> under standard illumination conditions.

30|$|The <b>block</b> <b>layer</b> for disk based storage (HDDs) {{has still}} {{remained}} highly volatile as the mechanical disks cannot support multiple hardware queues {{due to their}} physical constraints. Therefore, HDDs can have multiple software queues but single Hardware queue. The objective function of <b>block</b> <b>layer</b> for disk based storage is to optimize the request order from various applications in-order to recreate sequentiality of disk access and manage the I/O bandwidth for every application. BID schemes utilize multiple software queues in the <b>block</b> <b>layer,</b> but single hardware queue for delivering SDS solutions for disk based storage devices.|$|R
30|$|Despite {{advanced}} optimizations applied across various layers {{along the}} odyssey of data access, the I/O stack still remains volatile. The Linux OS (Host) <b>block</b> <b>layer</b> {{is the most}} critical part of the I/O hierarchy as it orchestrates the I/O requests from different applications to the underlying storage. The key {{to the performance of}} the <b>block</b> <b>layer</b> is the <b>Block</b> I/O scheduler, which is responsible for dividing the I/O bandwidth amongst the contending processes as well as determines the order of requests sent to storage device. Figure 1 shows the importance of the <b>block</b> <b>layer.</b> We observe that irrespective of the data-center storage architecture, i.e. SAN, NAS or DAS, the final interaction with the physical media is in blocks (sectors in HDD, pages in SSD).

30|$|The {{solar cell}} with the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> {{exhibits}} the highest {{power conversion efficiency}} with 2.71 % followed by the device employing the conventional <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> with 2.56 %. The reference device without <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> is poorly functional which is indicated {{not only by the}} low efficiency of 0.50 % but also by significantly lower values for the short-circuit current, the open-circuit voltage {{as well as for the}} fill factor. Furthermore, the absence of a <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> leads to a linear current–voltage relation for this device and demonstrates the necessity of the <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> for this type of solid-state DSSCs.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} compare {{the effect of the}} <b>blocking</b> <b>layer,</b> two kinds of DSSCs were assembled: (a) a {{pristine}} cell fabricated from the ESD TiO 2 <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> and (b) a SHI cell using an irradiated ESD TiO 2 <b>blocking</b> <b>layer.</b> In addition, a reference cell was fabricated from the TiO 2 <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> prepared by conventional spin coating (Ti(IV) bis (ethyl acetonato)-diisopropoxide solution in 2 wt% of 1 -butanol) and was also tested under identical experimental conditions. Further, TiO 2 photoanodes thickness about ~ 6 μm were prepared on the TiO 2 <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> using TiO 2 paste (Solaronix) by a doctor blade technique [27] and subsequently sintered at 450 °C for 30 min in air.|$|E
30|$|For {{both types}} of <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> a linear current–voltage {{relation}} is found, indicating that an ohmic contact is present. The difference in work function of TiO 2 (Φ =  4.2  eV) and FTO (Φ =  4.3 – 4.4  eV) {{is too small to}} create a rectifying Schottky-contact to result in a diode-like IV-curve (Peng et al. 2004; Qiao and McLeskey 2005). However, these measurements clearly show that the current flow is significantly higher for the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> than for the conventional <b>blocking</b> <b>layer.</b> The conductance, as determined by the slopes of the curves, is 78  mS for the hybrid and 37  mS for the conventional <b>blocking</b> <b>layer.</b> Thus, the current flow through the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> is increased by 110 %. This increased current flow is attributed to the reduced film thickness and the associated decreased serial resistance of the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer.</b> Furthermore, it verifies the findings from TEM, ESI and GISAXS, where a percolating TiO 2 network was found, as the increased current flow shows that no or only few discontinuities are present in the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer.</b> The increased macroscopic conductance of the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> promises a positive impact on the power conversion efficiency of solar cells. This impact is investigated in the following section.|$|E
30|$|Unfortunately, despite it’s significance, the <b>block</b> <b>layer,</b> {{essentially}} the <b>block</b> I/O scheduler hasn’t evolved {{to meet the}} volume and contention resolution needs of data centers experiencing Big Data workloads. We have designed and developed two Contention Avoidance Storage solutions in the Linux <b>block</b> <b>layer,</b> collectively known as “BID: Bulk I/O Dispatch”, specifically to suit multi-tenant, multi-tasking Big Data shared resource environments.|$|R
30|$|Information {{capturing}} Accounting {{information such}} as block, file and process the requests belong to, is isolated from the device driver, as {{the function of the}} device driver is only to transmit the requests from the <b>block</b> <b>layer</b> to the physical storage.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the carrier <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> on the {{emission}} color of the color tunable organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) have been investigated. Color tuning {{is controlled by the}} applied voltage. Both the experimental and theoretical results show that inserting a hole <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> between two adjacent emission layers will make the color tunable region move toward the wide bandgap emission layer of blue color in our case. By replacing the hole <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> with an electron <b>blocking</b> <b>layer,</b> the color tunable region will shift toward the small bandgap emission layer of red. Besides shifting the tunable region toward the pure spectral color, the introduction of the carrier <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> can extend the color tunable range. © 2007 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{we suggest}} {{the use of}} GZO {{transparent}} electrodes with a TiO 2 <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> for DSSCs. The TiO 2 <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> can protect the GZO electrodes from the acidic dye solution and the oxidation at high temperature. The use of a thin TiO 2 <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> can also reduce the recombination of electrons at the electrode/electrolyte interface.|$|E
30|$|The film {{thickness}} determined from the SEM image varies locally between 30 and 90  nm {{due to the}} high roughness of the FTO. The XRR profile of the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> shows a superposition of two different layers, i.e. the porous TiO 2 network and the ceramic material. The fit to the data yields a thickness of (78  ±  2) nm. For the conventional <b>blocking</b> <b>layer,</b> which {{is used as a}} reference, a {{film thickness}} of (121  ±  2) nm is determined by XRR (data not shown here), representing the optimum thickness for this type of <b>blocking</b> <b>layer.</b> Thus, by using the hybrid material, a reduction of the <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> film thickness of 36 % is realized. This reduction in film thickness offers the possibility to increase the conductance of the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> while maintaining its rectifying function.|$|E

30|$|An {{electrostatic}} {{spray deposition}} (ESD) technique followed by SHI irradiation using 100 MeV oxygen ions {{resulted in the}} formation of an efficient, dense TiO 2 <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> between the TiO 2 particle layer and the TCO substrate. The <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> promotes charge transport from the TiO 2 layer to the TCO substrate by modifying the TCO/TiO 2 interfaces and causes effective electrical contact between the two layers. The formation of an effective, compact <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> was possible due to instantaneous surface melting of the ESD TiO 2 nanoparticles associated with a local temperature rise upon oxygen ion irradiation. Energy conversion efficiency was improved to a large extent (η = 5.5 %), compared to that of the conventional <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> (η = 3.8 %), mainly due to the increase in electron transport through the <b>blocking</b> <b>layer,</b> resulting from better contact among TiO 2 nanoparticles and better adhesion with the TCO substrate.|$|E
30|$|A hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> {{consisting}} of a conducting TiO 2 network embedded in a ceramic matrix is implemented in a solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell. This novel type of <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> is thinner than the classical <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> films as shown with SEM and XRR measurements, and thereby the conductivity of the hybrid film is increased by 110 %. A percolating TiO 2 network, proven by TEM/ESI and GISAXS measurements, allows for the charge transport. Although being thinner, the hybrid film completely separates the rough electrode material from the hole-transport medium in solar cells to avoid the recombination of charge carriers at this interface. In total, the power conversion efficiency of solar cells is improved: the application in photovoltaics shows that the efficiency of devices with the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> is increased by 6 % compared to identical solar cells employing the conventional <b>blocking</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|E
