Pierrothito's victory was seen as a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise,</b> first and {{foremost}} because he was a Rudo just like Demus 3:16, but also because Demus and Bam Bam, the last man eliminated by Pierrothito, was a longtime rival and had frequently talked about wanting to move up a division in various interviews.|$|E
500|$|Kemp {{was partly}} at fault for not {{achieving}} either of his primary goals {{because he did}} not get {{along with the rest of}} the Cabinet. At one point, Kemp told James Baker, White House Chief of Staff, that Bush's best chance to win reelection was to dump his economic advisors in dramatic fashion. Before the 1992 Republican National Convention, Kemp and six prominent Republican conservatives prepared a controversial memo urging Bush to revise his economic policy. Contemporaneously, conservative Republicans in office and in the media such as William F. Buckley Jr. and George Will felt Dan Quayle should be ousted in favor of Kemp. This followed Kemp's reference to parts of the President's economic policy as [...] "gimmicks" [...] after the 1992 State of the Union Address. Kemp was respected within the party for opposing Bush, and towards the end of Bush's administration insiders recognized his value. In late 1991, 81 of the 166 Republican Congressmen signed a letter co-authored by Curt Weldon and Dan Burton requesting that Bush cede some domestic authority to Kemp as a [...] "domestic policy czar." [...] The letter, highlighting Kemp's [...] "energy, enthusiasm and national clout", insulted Bush. Kemp was a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to stay in the [...] for the duration of his presidency, and he was described as one of the few Bush Administration members who would take tough stands. Kemp did not expect to be retained if the Republicans were reelected in 1992, and some pundits agreed with him.|$|E

5000|$|Initially, Assayas {{was worried}} about finding the right actor to play Carlos because they needed one who had [...] "the {{shoulders}} and the charisma to carry this kind of movie on his back".

The production was shot in seven months across three continents in countries such as Austria, France, Germany, Hungary, Lebanon, and Morocco. The film was shot mostly in English with passages in French, Spanish, Hungarian, Italian, Arabic, German, Russian, Dutch and Japanese. As filming continued, Ramirez put on 35 pounds in order to resemble Carlos's overweight physical condition {{at the time of his}} capture. The final two hours of the film were shot in sequence.|$|R
