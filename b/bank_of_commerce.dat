5|$|Born in 1794, Acors Barns {{was the son}} a mariner {{and lived}} in Westerly, Rhode Island before moving to Stonington, Connecticut. Barns moved to New London, Connecticut and formed a whaling company with William Williams Jr. in 1827. The company prospered {{and became one of}} the largest firms in the city, but Barns avoided the 1849 decline of the whaling {{industry}} by investing elsewhere. Barns invested in the Willimantic and Palmer Railroad before establishing the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commerce</b> in 1852. Barns died in 1862, but his sons would continue the successful <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commerce.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the High Court Colin Rimer QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, {{held that}} since the shares were all identical, the lack of {{segregation}} between them did not invalidate the trust. The standard case in this area, Re London Wine Co (Shippers) Ltd, was distinguished because the subject matter there was potentially different, while all of Moss's shares were identical. Rimer J instead cited with approval Rollestone v National <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commerce</b> in St. Louis, a decision of the Supreme Court of Minnesota where it was held {{that there was no}} need for segregation in such a situation.|$|E
5|$|Information on West Cheswalds {{early career}} is lacking, but records {{of some of}} her {{movements}} and cargo are available. On 30 September 1920, West Cheswald took on a load of white sugar at Java {{and headed for the}} United States via the Suez Canal. While she was near Bermuda, West Cheswald was diverted from her original destination of New York to Philadelphia, to deliver her cargo in fulfillment of an order. Because the cargo had not been originally headed to Philadelphia, the purchasers refused to pay for it, believing that the voyage took too long. After litigation and various appeals, the case ended up before the Supreme Court of the United States in 1928 as Lamborn v. National <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commerce,</b> 276 U.S. 469 (1928). The court found that under the contract signed, the purchasers were obligated for the sugar {{regardless of whether or not}} the ship had originally been destined for Philadelphia. West Cheswald was also reported in Hawaiian service during 1920. The report of the Governor of Hawaii in the annual report of the United States Department of the Interior for the 1920–21 fiscal year, listed West Cheswald among the four -owned ships sailed to Hawaii by the Pacific Steamship Company.|$|E
