She had no choice in these matters, often decided in her childhood. An adult daughter might wish to become a votary, perhaps in preference to an uncongenial marriage, and it seems that her father could not refuse her wish.|$|E

500|$|For {{readers of}} the modern age, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon (1737–94) further {{cemented}} the scandalous reputation of Elagabalus.

500|$|The Annunciation draws {{heavily on}} van der Weyden's 1430s Louvre Annunciation, his c.1455 [...] Saint Columba altarpiece, and the Clugny Annunciation (c.1465–75), which is {{attributed}} to either van der Weyden or Memling. Memling almost certainly was apprenticed to van der Weyden in Brussels until setting up his own workshop in Bruges sometime after 1465. Memling's Annunciation is more innovative, with motifs such as the attendant angels that were absent in the earlier paintings. According to Till-Holger Borchert, not only was Memling familiar with van der Weyden's motifs and compositions, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have assisted with the underdrawing in van der Weyden's workshop. The shutters on the right are copied from the Louvre panel, the knotted curtain appears in the Columba triptych's [...] "Annunciation".|$|E
500|$|Theroux {{described}} approaching filming without entirely {{understanding what}} the plot was about: [...] "You {{get the whole}} script, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> as well withhold the scenes you're not in, because the whole {{turns out to be}} more mystifying than the parts. David welcomes questions, but he won't answer any of them... You work kind of half-blindfolded. If he were a first-time director and hadn't demonstrated any command of this method, I'd probably have reservations. But it obviously works for him." [...] Theroux noted that the only answer Lynch did provide was that he was certain that Theroux's character, a Hollywood director, was not autobiographical of Lynch. Watts stated that she tried to bluff Lynch by pretending she had the plot figured out, and that he delighted in the cast's frustration.|$|E

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire sharpened in 894, because Emperor Leo the Wise forced the Bulgarian merchants to leave Constantinople and settle in Thessaloniki. Subsequently, Tzar Simeon I of Bulgaria invaded Byzantine territories and defeated a small imperial troop. The Byzantines approached the Hungarians to hire them {{to fight the}} Bulgarians. Nicetas Sclerus, the Byzantine envoy, concluded a treaty with their leaders, Árpád and Kurszán (Kusan) and Byzantine ships transferred Hungarian warriors across the Lower Danube. The Hungarians invaded Bulgaria, forced Tzar Simeon to flee to the fortress of Dristra (now Silistra, Bulgaria) and plundered Preslav. An interpolation in Porphyrogenitus's work states that the Hungarians had a prince named [...] "Liountikas, son of Arpad" [...] at that time, which suggests {{that he was the}} commander of the army, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have been mentioned in the war context by chance.|$|E
500|$|In Britain, Gambier's conduct {{has been}} criticised by historians {{ever since the}} battle, such as William Laird Clowes, who wrote in 1901 that [...] "there can be no {{question}} that affair of Aix Road was mismanaged by the Admiralty at home and by the Admiral on the spot" [...] and that [...] "a great naval commander never loses an occasion to attack when conditions are favourable to him." [...] In 2007 historian Noel Mostert wrote [...] "Oh Nelson! Nelson, Nelson, where were you? Never could {{the absence of the}} man from a scene of action clearly designed for his drive and decision have been more painfully alive." [...] In the same year David Cordingly wrote that [...] "The boldness of the attack [...] [...] [...] was comparable with the exploits of a Drake, de Ruyter and Nelson. And yet the action at Basque Roads has come to be regarded as a wasted opportunity, a bungled and confused affair." [...] Perhaps the most damning response came from an enemy. Years later, Napoleon wrote to an English correspondent that Cochrane [...] "could not only have destroyed , [...] [...] [...] <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> and would have taken them out, had your admiral supported him as he ought to have done [...] [...] [...] The French admiral was a fool , but yours was just as bad." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{perform the}} {{manoeuvre}} of gliding downward against the breeze, utilizing both gravity and the wind, Eilmer employed an apparatus somewhat resembling a gliding bird. However {{being unable to}} balance himself forward and backwards, as does a bird by slight movements of its wings, head and legs, he would have needed a large tail to maintain equilibrium. Eilmer could not have achieved true soaring flight in any event, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have glided down in safety if {{he had had a}} tail. Afterwards, Eilmer remarked that the cause of his crash was that [...] "he had forgotten to provide himself with a tail." ...|$|E

2500|$|There was an {{international}} controversy {{about the death}} of a solo British climber David Sharp, who attempted to climb Mount Everest in 2006 but died in his attempt. The story broke out of the mountaineering community into popular media, with a snow-balling series of interviews, allegations, critiques, and peace-making. The question was whether climbers that season had left a man to die, and whether he could have been saved. He was said to have attempted to summit Mount Everest by himself with no Sherpa or guide and fewer oxygen bottles than considered normal. He went with a low-budget Nepali guide firm that only provides support up to Base Camp, after which climbers go as a [...] "loose group", offering a high degree of independence. The manager at Sharp's guide support said Sharp did not take enough oxygen for his summit attempt and did not have a Sherpa guide. It is less clear who knew Sharp was in trouble, and if they did know, whether they were qualified or capable of helping him. Double-amputee climber Mark Inglis revealed {{in an interview with the}} press on 23 May 2006, that his climbing party, and many others, had passed Sharp, on 15 May, sheltering under a rock overhang [...] below the summit, without attempting a rescue. Inglis said 40 people had passed by Sharp, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have been overlooked as climbers assumed Sharp was the corpse nicknamed [...] "Green Boots", but Inglis was not aware that Turkish climbers had tried to help Sharp despite being in the process of helping an injured woman down (a Turkish woman named Burçak Poçan). There has also been some discussion about Himex in the commentary on Inglis and Sharp. In regards to Inglis's initial comments, he later revised certain details because he had been interviewed while he was [...] "...physically and mentally exhausted, and in a lot of pain. He had suffered severe frostbite — he later had five fingertips amputated." [...] When they went through Sharp's possessions they found a receipt for $7,490USD, believed to be the whole financial cost. Comparatively, most expeditions are between $35,000 to $100,000USD plus an additional $20,000 in other expenses that range from gear to bonuses. It was estimated on 14 May that Sharp summitted Mount Everest and began his descent down, but 15 May he was in trouble but being passed by climbers on their way up and down. On 15 May 2006 it is believed he was suffering from hypoxia, and was about 1,000 feet from the summit on the North Side route.|$|E
