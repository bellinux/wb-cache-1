50|$|In 1917 the Sharon Steel Hoop Company {{expanded}} by buying the Youngstown Iron and Steel Company, with a steel plant at Lowellville, and sheet mills in Youngstown.

The Sharon Steel Hoop Company also acquired the Mary Furnace from the Ohio Iron and Steel Company to secure a source of pig iron supply for the Lowellville Plant, and added to the Mary Plant two new open hearth furnaces, a 34” reversing blooming mill, and a 21&$#148; <b>bar</b> <b>mill,</b> These improvements {{made it possible to}} abandon the now obsolete steel making facilities and blooming mill at the Sharon Works in 1920.|$|E
5000|$|In 1946 {{steel plate}} rolling ended. In 1953 the 11 in {{continuous}} <b>bar</b> <b>mill</b> was completed, {{which was to}} roll both straight and coiled bar. In 1963 the new site covered some 370 acre and the Roundwood site, beside the Midland Main Line north of the main works, and covering another 220 acre was starting production. The plant then included two mechanically-charged blast furnaces feeding 10 open hearth steel making furnaces which, in turn, fed two primary mills for rolling blooms and billets and six finishing mills rolling {{a wide range of}} blooms, billets, slabs, sections, bars and strip. The Roundwood site had an 11" [...] continuous <b>bar</b> <b>mill</b> and a narrow hot strip mill. Capacity at the time was about 425,000 tons of carbon, low alloy, and free-cutting steel and ingots.|$|E
50|$|The Combination Steel and Iron Company {{was soon}} {{producing}} 150 tons of steel a week. By the mid-1880s, the company plant included eight furnaces, plus a rail mill with {{a capacity of}} 30,000 tons per annum, a 20-inch angle mill with an annual capacity of 10,000 tons, and a 12-inch <b>bar</b> <b>mill</b> with an annual capacity of 6,000 tons.|$|E

The billets are then distributed to the three steel finishing facilities (rail mill, rod & <b>bar</b> <b>mill,</b> seamless tube mill) for processing into the various finished products.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{bibliographical review}} aims to {{determine}} the present situation of the implant-supported <b>milled</b> <b>bar</b> overdenture as a therapeutic option in implantology, {{as well as to}} set and compare the techniques and materials currently used for making them. Materials and methods: By searching the main electronic bibliographical data in indexed Medline articles, we obtained a total number of 20 articles that fulfilled the requirements of this bibliographical review. Results: The implant-supported <b>milled</b> <b>bar</b> overdenture offers excellent long-term successful results, although complication rates are higher in emergency cases of patients initially planned for a fixed prosthesis. Krenmair and collaborators found cumulative survival rates of implants on <b>milled</b> <b>bars</b> after 5 years, of 99 % in mandible cases, and of 97. 8 % in maxilla cases. No detailed protocols specifying the necessary number of implants or their characteristics have been found, though they are never made with less than 4 implants in mandible or 4 - 6 in the maxilla. <b>Milled</b> <b>bars</b> are screwed, generally cast in a precious metal alloy, with a metal or acrylic suprastructure and include attachments that regulate the tightness. The suprastructure adjusts precisely and rigidly to the <b>milled</b> <b>bar,</b> and presents similar biomechanical movements to those of fixed prostheses. The overdenture is removable and its prophylaxis is simple. Conclusions: The implant supported <b>milled</b> <b>bar</b> overdenture is a very interesting option in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe reabsorbed maxilla problems. It offers both the advantages of removable prostheses as well as the stability and retention of a fixed prosthesis...|$|R
50|$|Unable to get {{favorable}} steel {{prices from}} American manufacturers and {{unhappy with the}} imported steel available at the time, Iverson (a metallurgist by training) decided to extend Nuclear vertically into steelmaking by building its first steel <b>bar</b> <b>mill</b> in Darlington, South Carolina, in 1968. The company chose to purchase an electric arc furnace, which was far cheaper than the traditional steel blast furnace, with a US $6,000,000 loan secured {{by all of the}} company's assets.

5000|$|The {{first record}} of the hammer mill dates to the year 1607, when {{the owner of the}} demesne in Freibergsdorf, Ernst Schönlebe, was granted water for his (iron) <b>bar</b> <b>mill</b> or Zainhammer. On several occasions, the water of the Goldbach was the subject of dispute between the Freiberg Mine, the hammer mill and a {{neighbouring}} mill. Over the course of the centuries, the hammer works primarily manufactured iron products both for the mining industry (e. g. tools like hammers, chisels, crow bars) as well as implements for agricultural use. Until its sale to St. John's Hospital in 1903, the hammer mill had been privately owned. Between 1903 and 1945 it made copper products almost exclusively. Commercial operations were finally ended in 1974.|$|E
