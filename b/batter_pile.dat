Using 3 D Finite Element Method a model has been developed to investigate dynamic response of <b>batter</b> <b>pile</b> groups. The governing constitutive model behavior for analysis is a Hardening Drucker-Prager behavior. In order to implement boundary conditions to soil medium series of Dashpot Elements are attached to the media so that absorbing boundary conditions have been taken into account. The pile group model has been affected by seismic excitations and the analysis has been performed using Rayleigh damping through dynamic explicit method. The group pile studied in the present work consists of four frictional piles which different model groups have been created during parametric study. The present research aims to study the effect of pile inclination angle on the performance of <b>batter</b> <b>pile</b> groups under seismic motions.

But the head of the engineering pile is used under some constraints. So the lateral bearing capacity is studied under different batter and different constraints at pile head by model experiments made by ourselves. The analysis indicates that (1) the lateral capacity of the negative <b>batter</b> <b>pile</b> decreases as the batter angle decreases when the pile head is only translational, (2) the lateral capacity of the negative batter translational pile is more than that of the positive batter free pile and (3) the proportional coefficients of the bearing capacity are provided under the experiment conditions...|$|E
40|$|Historically batter piles {{were used}} to resist lateral forces in marine structures. However, due to poor {{performance}} in recent earthquakes, plumb piles are now the system of choice. Nevertheless, there are situations where batter piles are desirable, for example, where the new structure has to be compatible with an existing <b>batter</b> <b>pile</b> structure or has high service-level lateral loading conditions such as ship mooring.

40|$|Many {{offshore}} structures {{are subjected to}} overturning moments due to wind load, wave pressure, and ship impacts. Also most of retaining walls are subjected to horizontal forces and bending moments, these forces are due to earth pressure. For foundations in such structures, usually a combination of vertical and batter piles is used. Little information {{is available in the}} literature about estimating the capacity of piles under uplift. In cases where these supporting piles are not vertical, the behavior under axial pullout is not well established. In order to delineate the significant variables affecting the ultimate uplift shaft resistance of <b>batter</b> <b>pile</b> in dry sand, a testing program comprising 62 pullout tests was conducted. The tests are conducted on model steel pile installed in loose, medium, and dense sand to an embedded depth ratio, L/d, vary from 7. 5 to 30 and with various batter angles of 0 °, 10 °, 20 °, and 30 °. Results indicate that the pullout capacity of a <b>batter</b> <b>pile</b> constructed in dense and/or medium density sand increases with the increase of batter angle attains maximum value and then decreases, the maximum value of Pα occurs at batter angle approximately equal to 20 °, and it is about 21 – 31 % more than the vertical pile capacity, while the pullout capacity for <b>batter</b> <b>pile</b> that constructed in loose sand decreases with the increase of pile inclination. The results also indicated that the circular pile is more resistant to pullout forces than the square and rectangular pile shape. The rough model piles tested is experienced 18 – 75 % increase in capacity compared with the smooth model piles. The suggested relations for the pullout capacity of <b>batter</b> <b>pile</b> regarding the vertical pile capacity are well predicted...|$|E

By the numerical simulation and the nonlinear time history response analysis of structure system and the moment–axial force relation curve, we analyzed the dynamic damage characteristics of the two different structures of batter and vertical piles under different seismic ground motions to provide reasonable basis and reference for designing and selecting a pile-supported wharf structure. Results showed that the axial force of batter piles was dominant in the <b>batter</b> <b>pile</b> structure and that batter piles could effectively bear and share seismic load. Under the seismic ground motion with peak ground acceleration (PGA) of 350 Gal and in consideration of the factors of the design requirement of horizontal displacement, the seismic performance of the <b>batter</b> <b>pile</b> structure was better {{than that of the}} vertical pile structure. Under the seismic ground motion with a PGA of 1000 Gal, plastic failure occurred in two different structures.

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} the seismic {{response}} of groups containing nonvertical piles are studied, including the lateral pile-head stiffnesses, the ""kinematic"" pile deformation, and the ""inertial"" soil-pile-structure response. A key goal is to explore {{the conditions under which}} the presence of <b>batter</b> <b>piles</b> is beneficial, indifferent, or detrimental. Parametric analyses are carried out using three-dimensional finite-element modeling, assuming elastic behavior of soil, piles, and superstructure. The model is first used to obtain the lateral stiffnesses of single <b>batter</b> <b>piles</b> and to show that its results converge to the available solutions from the literature. Then, real accelerograms covering a broad range of frequency characteristics are employed as base excitation of simple fixed-head two-pile group configurations, embedded in homogeneous, inhomogeneous, and layered soil profiles, while supporting very tall or very short structures. Five pile inclinations are considered while the corresponding vertical-pile group results serve as reference. It is found that in purely kinematic seismic loading, <b>batter</b> <b>piles</b> tend to confirm their negative reputation, as had also been found recently for a group subjected to static horizontal ground deformation. However, the total (kinematic plus inertial) response of structural systems founded on groups of <b>batter</b> <b>piles</b> offers many reasons for optimism. <b>Batter</b> <b>piles</b> may indeed be beneficial (or detrimental) depending on, among other parameters, the relative size of the overturning moment versus the shear force transmitted onto them from the superstructure. © 2010 ASCE...|$|R

While the case. of vertical piles is reasonably documented in the literature, the case of <b>batter</b> <b>piles</b> in sand has received little attention from the researchers.

However, the structures constructed in small rivers according to local or traditional technology revealed many disadvantages related to the economical, evacuation and ecological conditions. Hence, the demand for large sluices in the larger rivers and estuaries is increasing. In the Netherlands, several units of sluice caissons have been applied but their main function was only to permanently close the basin, while in Viet Nam only single caissons are applied as small river barriers. It is to be noted that a large discharge sluice with several caisson units has never been built so far in Vietnam or in the Netherlands. In contrast with this type of structure, most discharge sluices and barriers in the world have been built according to the "pier structure type". In the Netherlands piers and bottom slabs are normally placed on <b>batter</b> <b>pile</b> foundations. In Viet Nam, piers are often placed on vertical pile foundations and a bottom slab is replaced by supporting beams.

The main {{objective of this}} study is therefore to research an appropriate design for the sluice structure type that can be applied in Vung Tau Go Cong, which is the largest project of discharge sluice in Viet Nam so far. From the literature review, {{it can be seen that}} in the Netherlands, several units of sluice caisson have been applied but their main function was only to permanently close the basin, while in Viet Nam only a single caisson is applied as small river barriers. It is to say that a large discharge sluice with several units of caisson has never been built so far. In contrast with this type of structure, most of discharge sluices and barriers in the world have been build according to the “pier structure type”. In the Netherlands piers and bottom slabs are normally placed on <b>batter</b> <b>pile</b> foundations.

40|$|Ports are {{civil works}} {{which have a}} major {{societal}} and economic importance. Quay structures are infrastructural elements of primary significance for the functioning of a port system. The ability to economically design quay structures with sufficient seismic resistance is therefore of great importance when situated {{in areas that are}} prone to earthquakes. Conventional seismic design is force-based i. e. that structures are designed to have sufficient capacity to withstand a pseudo-static seismic design force. This methodology is associated with no insight in the performance of the structure when exceeding the pseudo-static limit equilibrium state and uneconomic design due to the demand that the structure can resist a very high seismic design force without deforming. A more advanced alternative is Performance-Based Design (PBD) methodology. In this methodology the key design parameters for the seismic performance of structures are stress states and deformations of soil and structure, rather than just a seismic design force. Furthermore it recognizes that varying amounts of permanent deformations associated with different degrees of (repairable) damage are allowable. The present study is embedded in the topic of performance-based seismic design of quay structures. Typical quay types are gravity-based quay walls, sheet pile quay walls and pile-deck structures. The observed trend in seismic quay design is that gravity and sheet pile type structures (i. e. retaining walls) are associated with areas with zero to low seismicity while pile-deck structures are generally the preferred solution in areas with higher seismicity. This can be explained by more favourable seismic performance (i. e. more deformation capacity) of pile-deck structures compared to retaining walls. In line with this trend it is found that PBD methodology is developed to significant lesser extent for retaining walls (especially anchored sheet pile walls) than for pile-deck structures. Therefore the present study focuses on performance-based seismic design of anchored sheet pile quay walls. In the seismic design methodology there are generally three levels of seismic analysis available, i. e. simplified analysis (pseudo-static), simplified dynamic analysis and dynamic analysis. Simplified analysis of anchored sheet pile quay walls is associated with conventional design methodology. Simplified dynamic analysis can be used to obtain a first estimate of permanent-displacement of a structure after exceeding limit equilibrium, based on an assumed failure mode. This type of analysis has to be made more suitable for anchored sheet pile quay walls. In dynamic analysis the seismic behaviour of a structure can be simulated by means of finite element software. Experience has shown that it is desirable to consider sheet pile quay walls in a less conservative way in (preliminary) seismic design for which pseudo-static methodology is commonly applied. Therefore the general objective of the present study is to propose improvements on (simplified) seismic design methodologies for anchored sheet pile quay walls by considering deformation behaviour. For this purpose a research methodology is developed in which pseudo-static, permanent-displacement and FE analysis are employed, calibrated with an experimental reference case that considers a typical anchored sheet pile quay wall. The reference case is taken from a conference paper. It reports on a shake table test under centrifugal gravity which is performed on a scale model of an existing sheet pile quay wall with a <b>batter</b> <b>pile</b> anchor. The quay is situated in homogeneous soil that consists of coarse densified sand. Due to the soil condition liquefaction effects are prevented. Sequential seismic loading of increasing severity is applied during the shake table testing. Measurement results that are reported in the reference case paper comprise bending moments in the sheet pile wall, normal forces in the anchor rod and horizontal displacements of the sheet pile wall. For simplified analysis a calibrated D-SHEET PILING model of the reference case anchored sheet pile quay wall is created. Through an iterative pseudo-static calculation procedure in which D-SHEET PILING and reference case dynamic bending moment results are fitted, it is attempted to find a deformation-based seismic load reduction for structural forces in the sheet pile wall that can be applied in pseudo-static design methodology. For simplified dynamic analysis an analytical limit equilibrium model is developed, based on the failure behaviour of the reference case. The goal of this model is that it can compute the critical acceleration of the anchored quay structure and estimate the sheet pile forces at this critical state. These abilities are validated with PLAXIS 2 D and checked with the reference case measurements respectively. Six accelerograms in the reference case soil column, obtained with equivalent linear site-response analysis (with SHAKE 2000), are combined with the computed critical acceleration for permanent-displacement (sliding-block) analysis. For dynamic analysis a calibrated PLAXIS 2 D model of the reference case anchored sheet pile quay wall is created. Dynamic performance of the PLAXIS 2 D model is validated with SHAKE 2000 by comparing site-response analysis results of both models. Pseudo-static and pseudo-dynamic calculations are applied to obtain the critical acceleration. Dynamic calculations with six bedrock motions are carried out to simulate the reference case experiment. PLAXIS 2 D calculation results are used to validate simplified and simplified dynamic analysis results and to gain insight in the seismic failure behaviour of the anchored sheet pile quay wall. Approaches for (simplified) performance-based seismic analysis of a typical anchored sheet pile quay wall are proposed {{as a result of the}} research. For pseudo-static methodology a deformation-based seismic load reduction for structural forces in the sheet pile wall is proposed. For the present reference case it is concluded that a reduction in the range of 45 % to 50 % is allowable. For simplified dynamic analysis a limit equilibrium model is proposed to compute the critical acceleration of the present quay structure and to estimate sheet pile forces at this critical state. It is concluded that the ability of the limit equilibrium model is satisfactory. Although subjected to uncertainty, permanent-displacement analysis results indicate that the sliding-block analysis, originally developed for embankments, is possibly not suitable for anchored sheet pile quay walls. For dynamic analysis it is concluded that PLAXIS 2 D is able to compute the reference case failure behaviour reasonably well, despite some computational setbacks. Complementary is the conclusion that PLAXIS 2 D pseudo-static approach proves to be suitable to determine the critical acceleration of an anchored sheet pile structure in contrast to pseudo-dynamic approach which appears less suitable for that matter. In addition the performance-based design principle is linked to the present study so that an idea about the seismic performance limits of anchored sheet pile quay walls in quantitative terms can be provided. As a result of the present study findings it is recommended to perform more extensive research on the ability of permanent-displacement analysis to evaluate the amount of sliding displacement of an anchored sheet pile quay wall. In line with this recommendation it is found that further research on site-response analysis is desirable in the application of simplified dynamic and dynamic analysis. In general it is recommended to create more seismic test cases with different setups for a broader validity of the present results, to develop a seismic test case for the Groningen earthquake situation, to add measurement instrumentation to new and existing structures for verification of research results and to make such (raw) measurement data available to the public.

Then, 18 different lateral load tests were carried out in the centrifuge on the 3 x 3 and the 4 x 4 fixed-head <b>battered</b> <b>pile</b> groups to investigate the effects of vertical load on the group lateral resistance. Vertical dead loads ranging from approximately 20 to 80 % of the vertical ultimate group capacity P-uv were applied. Based on these tests, the effects of vertical dead load on the lateral resistance of the <b>battered</b> <b>pile</b> groups are found to depend on pile arrangement, pile inclination, and soil density.

In many practical situations, structures subjected to lateral loading are located near or in excavated and fill slopes or embankments. Full-scale research {{to examine the effects of}} soil slope on lateral pile capacity is limited. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects on lateral capacity of piles located in or near cohesionless soil slopes. A full-scale lateral load testing program was undertaken on pipe piles in a cohesionless soil at Oregon State University. Five piles were tested near a 2 H: 1 V test slope and located between 0 D to 8 D behind the slope crest, where D is the pile diameter. Two vertical baseline <b>piles</b> and three <b>battered</b> <b>piles</b> were also tested in level ground conditions. The cohesionless backfill soil was a well-graded material with a fines content of less than 10 % and a relative compaction of 95 %, meeting the Caltrans specification for structural backfill...|$|R
5000|$|The {{vertical}} travel lead, {{referred to as}} [...] "VTL" [...] system, was first developed and patented by C.W. Bermingham in the 1970s. This lead system was developed {{in response to the}} fundamental limitations of either a fixed lead or swinging lead system. The fixed lead system is well suited to level job sites with few obstructions and has the advantage of faster positioning of the lead. The hanging lead is very adaptable to different elevations and <b>batter</b> <b>piles</b> but takes much longer to position. The Vertical Travel Lead was developed to combine the fast and accurate positioning of fixed leads, with the ability to adjust the height of the lead base up or down. The VTL lead is connected to the boom by a sliding connection, which allows the lead to be elevated or lowered below grade. The VTL system has become the industry standard in Canada, US Railway Construction, and many parts of the USA. Vertical Travel Leads come in two main forms: Spud and Box Lead types. Box leads are very common in the Southern United States and Spud Leads are common in the Northern United States, Canada and Europe.|$|R
40|$|Piles {{supporting}} marine {{structures such as}} jetties, relieving platforms, quay {{walls and}} fixed offshore structures are subjected to lateral loads due to berthing and mooring forces, wind, waves, storm surges and current forces. This paper presents some factors that affect the design of pile groups supporting marine structures founded in cohesionless soils. Some main aspects {{that should be considered}} in the pile group design are addressed such as <b>pile</b> <b>batter</b> angle, <b>pile</b> group arrangement, pile spacing, pile slenderness ratio and magnitude of lateral static loading. Numerical analyses were conducted to investigate these design aspects with and without impact of scour. Different scour depths were considered to cover the possible root causes of scour around pile groups such as waves, current and ship propeller jets. The study revealed that scour has greater impact on lateral loading of pile groups compared to its impact on single piles. Pile groups with side-by-side arrangement exposed to scour are more critical than single piles and piles groups with tandem arrangement due to the combined effect of scour and pile-soil-pile interaction. It is also concluded that scour protection is not always required. More attention and considerations should be given to scour protection around piles especially if the piles are closely spaced, arranged side-by-side and if slenderness ratio is less than 12. 5...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results of a research effort conducted to better understand the seismic performance and analysis of pile-supported wharves. Given the limited number of well-documented field case histories, the seismic performance of pile-supported wharves has been poorly quantified, and the analysis methods commonly employed in engineering practice have generally not been validated. Field case histories documenting the seismic performance of pile-supported wharves commonly contain only limited information, such as approximations of wharf and embankment deformations and peak ground surface accelerations. In order to supplement the field data, five centrifuge models were dynamically tested, with each model containing close to 100 instruments monitoring pile bending moments, excess pore pressures, displacements, and accelerations. The combined field and model database was used to develop seismic performance relationships between permanent lateral deformations, maximum and residual bending moments and peak ground surface displacements. Key issues such as the seismic performance of <b>batter</b> <b>piles,</b> the development of large moments at depth, and the need to account for permanent lateral deformations for high levels of shaking, even for very stable geometries, are discussed. The field data and model studies were also used to validate two geotechnical seismic performance analysis methods: 1) the limit-equilibrium based rigid, sliding block (Newmark) method, and 2) an advanced finite-difference effective stress based numerical model (FLAC). Favorable predictions were generally obtained for both methods, yet there was a large variability in the results predicted using the rigid, sliding block method. The numerical model predicted the permanent deformations, pore pressure generation, and accelerations fairly well, however, pile bending moments were poorly predicted. The results of this research clearly highlighted the need for analysis validation studies, and note the uncertainty and variability inherent in the seismic performance of complex structures. The lack of adequate validation may lead to an over-confidence and false sense of security in the results of the seismic analysis methods. This dissertation specifically addresses pile-supported wharves, yet the results presented herein are applicable to other pile-supported structures located near, or on, slopes adjacent to the waterfront, such as: bridge abutments, railroad trestles, and pile-supported buildings near open slopes. Performance and analysis issues common to all of these structures are addressed, such as: liquefiable soils, lateral pile response in horizontal and sloping soils, the lateral behavior of piles in rock fill, and global slope stability, as well as the general observed seismic behavior...|$|R
40|$|Elastic-plastic, closed-form {{solutions}} {{were developed}} recently by the author, {{to capture the}} nonlinear response of laterally loaded rigid piles. Presented in compact form, the solutions are convenient to use, and sufficiently accurate despite using only two input parameters of the net limiting force per unit length pu along the pile, and a subgrade modulus k. Nevertheless, piles may be subjected to limited cap-restraints or loading below ground surface, which alter the response remarkably. This paper provides explicit expressions for estimating loading capacity of anchored piles and develops new solutions for lateral piles with cap-rotation by stipulating a constant pu or a linear increasing pu (Gibson pu) with depth. Lateral loading capacity Ho (at the tip-yield state and yield at rotation point state) and maximum bending moment Mm (at the tip-yield state) are presented against loading locations, and in form of the lateral capacity Ho-. Mo (applied moment) locus. The capacity is consistent with available solutions for anchored piles, and caissons with either pu profile, allowing a united approach from lateral piles to anchored piles. The new solutions are also presented in charts to highlight the impact of rotational stiffness of pile-cap on nonlinear response, offering a united approach for free-head piles through fixed-head piles. Several advantages of the solutions are identified against the prevalent p-. y curve based approach. To estimate the key parameter pu, values of the resistance factor Np (=ratio of pile-soil limiting resistance over the undrained shear strength su) are deduced using the current expressions against available normalised pile capacity involving the impact of gapping (between pile and soil), pile movement mode, pile slenderness ratio, inclined loading angle (anchored <b>piles)</b> and <b>batter</b> angles (lateral <b>piles).</b> The Np is characterised by: (i) An increase from 5. 6 - 8. 6 to 10. 14 - 11. 6, as gapping is eliminated around lateral piles and caissons, and from 1. 0 - 6. 1 to 2. 8 - 9. 8, as translation is converted into rotation mode of footings. (ii) Similar variations with slenderness ratio between anchors and caissons (without gapping), and among anchors, caissons and pipelines (with gapping). And (iii) A reduction with loading angles (anchors) resembling that with <b>batter</b> angles (<b>piles).</b> © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] A coupled soil-pile interaction analysis method for pile groups within moving soil is proposed and implemented in a new computer program MU-PILE-GROUP. Results of evaluations described in this dissertation indicate that the response of pile groups subjected to soil movement can be accurately predicted using MU-PILE-GROUP. Results of analyses presented also show that modifications to commonly used p-y and t-z models (p-multipliers, y-multipliers and t-multiplier) are required to produce close matches between the predicted response from MU-PILE-GROUP and measured response from a series of large-scale laboratory tests. The relationship between these multipliers and spacing ratio and <b>pile</b> <b>batter</b> angle were investigated to improve understanding of soil-pile interaction and to provide recommendations for use of MU-PILE-GROUP. A range of p-multipliers varying from 0. 15 to 1. 8 and a range of y-multipliers varying from 0. 33 to 1 are required for the Reese sand model to produce close matches with measured lateral performance. p-multipliers required to match measured performance decrease with increasing pile spacing perpendicular to the direction of soil movement. y-multipliers required to match measured performance increase with increasing spacing perpendicular to the direction of soil movement. p-multipliers required to match measured performance also increase with increasing <b>pile</b> <b>batter</b> angle. The predicted axial performance reasonably matches the measured axial response for most upslope piles...|$|R
