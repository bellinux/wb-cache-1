5000|$|Most IBM {{keypunch}} and verifiers used {{a common}} electrical/mechanical design in their keyboards to encode the mechanical keystrokes. As a key was depressed, a link on the keystem tripped a corresponding set of bails {{at the top}} of the keyboard assembly.

As each key stroke was detected by the machine, a feed-back circuit energized a pair of magnets with a bail which restored the keystem mechanically, reset the bails performing the electrical encoding, and gave the [...] "feel" [...] and sound to the operator of a completed action.

Besides the indicated defects gets worse also the quality of the trench refilling: the uneven soil output into a trench with large portions results the damages of pipes isolation and emptinesses formation, in consequence  settling and washing of soil. A bulldozer with the screw intensifier (SI), is deprived lacks of an odinary bulldozer  moving along a trench, it moves the loose soil that does not fall on a pipeline, but rolles on it.

40|$|In {{the next}} twenty years in Finland, annual {{cuttings}} on peatland forests are foreseen to increase by up to 30 % of the total cuttings. Cost effective harvesting meth-ods on low yield peatland forests coupled with low ground bearing capacity are required. One solution to improve the feasibility of harvesting could be excavators tailored for forestry use and equipped with a harvesting head. In the study, cost competitiveness and productivity of the excavator-based harvester were investigated. The cost analysis focused on operating hours of harvester use, shift arrangements and purchase prices for the <b>base</b> <b>machine</b> and harvesting equipment when the base ma-chine was used partly as a harvester and an excavator. Results were compared to conventional wheeled harvest-ers. If the <b>base</b> <b>machine</b> is used more than 3 working months as a harvester in addition to normal (6 - 8 months) excavator work, the harvesting method would be cost competitive compared to purpose-built harvesters (if 1 and 2 shift arrangements were used). The 25 % increase of the base machine’s and harvester equipments ’ pur-chasing costs did not eliminate the cost competitiveness of harvesting, when harvesting was carried out in 1 shifts for at least 4 months. It would be feasible and profitable to invest in har-vesting equipment for the excavator and therefore dimin-ish the winter lay-days of the <b>base</b> <b>machine</b> by utilizing it in logging operations.

40|$|The {{machining}} of ultra-precision optical components with form tolerances in the sub-micron range {{requires a}} close {{interaction between the}} machine tool, {{the process and the}} procedure for the NC tool path generation. Especially for the optical free-form machining the choice of a data- format for the surface description as well as the calculation of the tool path is crucial for the overall achievable quality of the work piece. This paper presents the layout of a tool path calculation based on the NURBS (Non-Uniform-Rotational-B-Spline) data format that has been developed at the Fraunhofer IPT. In addition the interfaces and the hardware and software for the realisation of a NURBS based control unit for Fast Tool Servo (FTS) turning and local corrective polishing operations are described. In a second implementation step NURBS have been used for multi-axis machining. For this purpose a double-V-parallel kinematic system has been developed for NC controlled local polishing. A <b>base</b> <b>machine</b> fulfils a continuous 3 D-movement during the polishing process. The NC polishing module realises the superimposing of eccentric movements and angular alignments of the polishing pad. The NURBS data format is used during CAD/CAM operation for computing a G-code (<b>base</b> <b>machine)</b> as well as splines (polishing module). Actual development activities include the implementation of a NURBS control unit with an online trajectory generator for simultaneous multi-axis diamond machining improving computational power in combination with lean algorithms for the NURBS interpolation...|$|E
