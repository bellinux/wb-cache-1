2500|$|Early {{aluminum}} structures {{have shown}} to be more vulnerable to fatigue, either due to ineffective alloys, or imperfect welding technique being used. This contrasts with some steel and titanium alloys, which have clear fatigue limits and are easier to weld or <b>braze</b> together. [...] However, some of these disadvantages have since been mitigated with more skilled labor capable of producing better quality welds, automation, and the greater accessibility to modern aluminum alloys. Aluminum's attractive strength to weight ratio as compared to steel, and certain mechanical properties, assure it a place among the favored frame-building materials.|$|E
2500|$|A more {{economical}} method of bicycle frame construction uses cylindrical steel tubing connected by TIG welding, {{which does not}} require lugs to hold the tubes together. [...] Instead, frame tubes are precisely aligned into a jig and fixed in place until the welding is complete. [...] Fillet brazing is another method of joining frame tubes without lugs. It is more labor-intensive, and consequently {{is less likely to}} be used for production frames. As with TIG welding, Fillet frame tubes are precisely notched or mitered and then a fillet of brass is brazed onto the joint, similar to the lugged construction process. A fillet <b>braze</b> frame can achieve more aesthetic unity (smooth curved appearance) than a welded frame.|$|E
2500|$|Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) {{is among}} the hardest of all tool {{materials}} and is therefore extremely resistant to wear. [...] It consists of a layer of diamond particles, typically about [...] thick, bonded as a sintered mass to a tungsten-carbide support. Bits are fabricated using this material by either brazing small segments {{to the tip of}} the tool to form the cutting edges or by sintering PCD into a vein in the tungsten-carbide [...] "nib". [...] The nib can later be brazed to a carbide shaft; it can then be ground to complex geometries that would otherwise cause <b>braze</b> failure in the smaller [...] "segments". PCD bits are typically used in the automotive, aerospace, and other industries to drill abrasive aluminum alloys, carbon-fiber reinforced plastics, and other abrasive materials, and in applications where machine downtime to replace or sharpen worn bits is exceptionally costly. It should be noted that PCD is not used on ferrous metals due to excess wear resulting from a reaction between the carbon in the PCD and the iron in the metal.|$|E

50|$|<b>Brazing</b> {{has many}} {{advantages}} over other metal-joining techniques, such as welding. Since <b>brazing</b> does not melt the base metal of the joint, it allows much tighter control over tolerances and produces a clean joint {{without the need}} for secondary finishing. Additionally, dissimilar metals and non-metals (i.e. metalized ceramics) can be <b>brazed.</b> In general, <b>brazing</b> also produces less thermal distortion than welding due to the uniform heating of a <b>brazed</b> piece. Complex and multi-part assemblies can be <b>brazed</b> cost-effectively. Welded joints must sometimes be ground flush, a costly secondary operation that <b>brazing</b> does not require because it produces a clean joint. Another advantage is that the <b>brazing</b> can be coated or clad for protective purposes. Finally, <b>brazing</b> is easily adapted to mass production and it is easy to automate because the individual process parameters are less sensitive to variation.|$|R

50|$|Brazed {{hard metal}} joints are {{typically}} two to seven mils thick. The <b>braze</b> alloy joins {{the materials and}} compensates for the difference in their expansion rates.

Finally, the <b>braze</b> alloy joins the other two materials to create a composite structure, much as layers of wood and glue create plywood. The standard for <b>braze</b> joint strength in many industries is a joint that is stronger than either base material, so that when under stress, one or other of the base materials fails before the joint.|$|E

50|$|On wetting, brazes may {{liberate}} {{elements from}} the base metal. For example, aluminium-silicon <b>braze</b> wets silicon nitride, dissociates the surface so it can react with silicon, and liberates nitrogen, which may create voids along the joint interface and lower its strength. Titanium-containing nickel-gold <b>braze</b> wets silicon nitride and reacts with its surface, forming titanium nitride and liberating silicon; silicon then forms brittle nickel silicides and eutectic gold-silicon phase; the resulting joint is weak and melts at much lower temperature than may be expected.|$|E
