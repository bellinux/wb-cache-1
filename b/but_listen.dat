25|$|An amateur radio {{repeater}} is a specialty amateur radio station that extends {{the range of}} communications for other stations. A repeater uses a receiver tuned to one radio frequency and a transmitter tuned to another radio frequency. Other stations using a repeater station transmit on one frequency <b>but</b> <b>listen</b> for signals on the other frequency. If a repeater station is in a favorable location, such as on a tall tower, {{the top of a}} tall building, or on a mountaintop, stations that otherwise {{would not be able to}} communicate with each other can each use the repeater and establish two-way communications.|$|E
500|$|... "Get Me Bodied" [...] {{received}} acclaim {{from music}} critics who praised its party sound and Beyoncé's vocals. Chris Richards of The Washington Post {{referred to the}} track a [...] "club-hungry come-ons" [...] with a [...] "dexterous melody". He further stated that the [...] "skeletal" [...] track [...] "keeps Beyoncé tethered to the ground". Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly commented that [...] "a piddly home hi-fi can hardly capture the thunderous grandeur of 'Get Me Bodied,' which sets Beyoncé's harmonies above a pummeling track overseen by rap producer Swiss Beatz". Tim Finney of Pitchfork Media called the track a [...] "percussive, Diwali-esque jam". Us Weekly described [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] a [...] "snappy dance number." [...] Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker noted that the song sounds [...] "anxious." [...] Mike Joseph of PopMatters noted that the song {{is very similar to}} Gwen Stefani's [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] (2005) and expressed further praise about [...] "Get Me Bodied", writing: [...] " [...] Beyonce’s glorified version of a 'Hollaback Girl'-type song. [...] <b>But</b> <b>listen</b> to way she wails and shouts throughout the song! Gwen Stefani certainly isn’t capable of vocal gymnastics like this. When she sings [...] you can visualize beads of perspiration coming off of her as she shakes to this song." ...|$|E
500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, Sale el Sol received an average score of 89 based on 5 reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Carlos Quintana from About.com praised Shakira's experimentation with merengue and rock sounds on the album, noting that her [...] "never ending innovative style giving us {{an indication of}} her artistic evolution and current musical interests", and that Sale el Sol [...] "shows again why Shakira {{is one of the}} top Latin Pop artists in the world". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave it a very positive review, complimenting Shakira's versatility in her [...] "pan-global approach", and praising the album's simple and [...] "breezy" [...] nature, saying it [...] "never once sounds disparate or overworked -- it's sunny and easy, its natural buoyancy disguising Shakira's range and skill -- <b>but</b> <b>listen</b> closely and it becomes apparent that nobody makes better pop records in the new millennium than she does". The Billboard review of the album was also extremely positive, noting that its composition is [...] "infinitely more memorable and unique than the singer's baffling 2009 set, She Wolf", and that it [...] "manages to bridge the divide between the old and new Shakira with a spark that keeps you listening to the very end".|$|E

Many years later he said: [...] "I spent two years in bed recovering. It was the worst time of my life." [...] During convalescence he could do little else <b>but</b> <b>listen</b> to music and draw.|$|E
