I cannot argue for the script, the direction, the acting or even the mummy, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that I was not bored and {{sometimes}} I was unreasonably pleased." [...] Likewise, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B−" [...] grade and said, [...] "The Mummy {{would like to make}} you shudder, but it tries to do so without ever letting go of its jocular inconsequentiality." [...] Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film high marks for the acting as well as the special effects.|$|E

[...] On whether they could return to the series at some point, Bell said, [...] "I can't answer that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> it would be kind of {{cheating}} to make Mack cry like that only to buy it back—not that we haven't brought characters back from the dead.

500|$|At around 9:30 on {{the night}} of September 27, 1868, Hindman was assassinated by one or more unknown assailants who fired through his parlor window while he was reading his {{newspaper}} with his children. The musket shots hit Hindman in the jaw, throat, and hands, and he died eight hours later due to significant blood loss. Before his death, Hindman gave a farewell speech to his neighbors and political supporters from the porch of his house. With [...] "perfect composure", Hindman told listeners to [...] "unite their courage and determination to bring peace to the people". Hindman hinted at the recent political debate with Powell Clayton as a possible motivation for the shooting and said, [...] "I do not know who killed me; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say,</b> whoever it was, I forgive him." [...] He asked James H. O'Connor, the husband of Mollie's stepmother, to [...] "take care of my family and be a protector to my wife and dear little ones". After O'Connor accepted, Hindman stated, [...] "I forgive everybody, and hope they will forgive me." [...] Afterwards, he was too weak to continue speaking, and he sat down on a lounge. He remained there until he died early next morning. The assassination was announced in all major newspapers throughout the state. William Woodruff of the Gazette said Hindman died as an [...] "able and distinguished man" [...] whose [...] "short but splendid career" [...] {{had a profound impact on}} Arkansan state politics.|$|E

2500|$|On 8 July 2002, Persson fell {{while riding}} his bicycle at Harpsund and broke his left clavicle. Following this {{accident}} {{he was unable}} to lift his left arm for some time and almost fainted during a speech in Almedalen on 10 July 2002 and after a meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair on 15 July 2002. Present with him during the accident was Pär Nuder, Minister of Finance, and Sten Olsson, State Secretary. Pär Nuder wrote in his book Stolt men inte nöjd ("proud but not satisfied"), released in 2008, that Persson had fallen while riding his bicycle because he was drunk after consuming large amounts of alcoholic beverages. Persson said in response to these claims: [...] "I can't exactly recapitulate the event <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> as much that I'm surprised that Pär Nuder remembers anything".|$|E

If I might put it to you, I would say the principles of tariffs, the principle of railway connection, the principle of appeal in law, the principle of coinage, and in fact all those principles which exist at the present moment in the United States, irrespective of the local assemblies which exist in each separate state in that country." ...|$|E
