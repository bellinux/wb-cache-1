5|$|MYCN {{oncogene}} amplification {{within the}} tumor {{is a common}} finding in neuroblastoma. The degree of amplification shows a <b>bimodal</b> distribution: either 3- to 10-fold, or 100- to 300-fold. The presence of this mutation is highly correlated to advanced stages of disease.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism {{as early}} as 14.5million years ago {{has been linked to}} the Anahim hotspot, with the latest {{eruption}} having taken place in the last 8,000years. This volcanic activity has produced rocks that show a <b>bimodal</b> distribution in composition. While these rocks were being deposited, the hotspot coincided with periods of crustal extension and uplift. Activity in modern times has been limited to earthquakes and volcanic gas emissions.|$|E
5|$|In a {{paper by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos {{evidence}} is shown {{for a possible}} <b>bimodal</b> distribution of the distances to the ascending nodes of the ETNOs. This correlation {{is unlikely to be}} the result of observational bias since it also appears in the nodal distribution of large semi-major axis centaurs and comets. If it is due to the extreme TNOs experiencing close approaches to Planet Nine, it is consistent with a planet with a semi-major axis of 300–400 AU.|$|E
5|$|Level Mountain has {{experienced}} volcanic eruptions sporadically {{for the last}} 15 million years, making it the most persistent volcano of the NCVP. More than 20 eruptive centres are present on the summit and flanks of the massif. These have produced mainly felsic and mafic lavas, a chemical composition range typical of <b>bimodal</b> volcanism. Such volcanism commonly occurs at hotspots, continental rifts and leaky transform faults. The existence of olivine, orthopyroxene and spinel xenocrysts in Level Mountain basalt suggest that volcanism at the massif originated from the upper mantle. Hiatuses of up to a million years or more can be expected between periods of volcanic activity at Level Mountain.|$|E
5|$|Some {{forms of}} {{balancing}} selection do {{not result in}} fixation, but maintain an allele at intermediate frequencies in a population. This can occur in diploid species (with pairs of chromosomes) when heterozygous individuals (with just one copy of the allele) have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals (with two copies). This is called heterozygote advantage or over-dominance, of which the best-known example is the resistance to malaria in humans heterozygous for sickle-cell anaemia. Maintenance of allelic variation can also occur through disruptive or diversifying selection, which favours genotypes that depart from the average in either direction (that is, the opposite of over-dominance), and {{can result in a}} <b>bimodal</b> distribution of trait values. Finally, balancing selection can occur through frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of one particular phenotype depends on the distribution of other phenotypes in the population. The principles of game theory have been applied to understand the fitness distributions in these situations, particularly in the study of kin selection and the evolution of reciprocal altruism.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of globular clusters remains a poorly understood phenomenon {{and it remains}} uncertain whether the stars in a globular cluster form in a single generation or are spawned across multiple generations {{over a period of}} several hundred million years. In many globular clusters, most of the stars are at approximately the same stage in stellar evolution, suggesting that they formed at about the same time. However, the star formation history varies from cluster to cluster, with some clusters showing distinct populations of stars. An example of this is the globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that exhibit a <b>bimodal</b> population. During their youth, these LMC clusters may have encountered giant molecular clouds that triggered a second round of star formation. This star-forming period is relatively brief, compared to the age of many globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|The massif was {{identified}} by the crash mapping program of Operation Stikine in 1956. This program, masterminded by Canadian volcanologist Jack Souther, was carried out over the Stikine River area using a Bell helicopter. Reconnaissance mapping in 1962 by Jack Souther and Hu Gabrielse identified a sequence of lavas of late Tertiary to Quaternary age. Level Mountain was then studied by T. S. Hamilton in the 1970s who produced a detailed map and the first petrochemical study of the lavas. The andesites described in the 1920s were mapped as early Tertiary age, long before Level Mountain formed. Hamilton recognized the four sequences of alkali basalt flows and tuffs in the lava plateau {{as well as the}} overlying <b>bimodal</b> package of alkali basalt and peralkaline lavas and tuffs.|$|E
5|$|The region's {{precipitation}} pattern is <b>bimodal,</b> meaning agriculture is sustained through snowfall during winter and autumn and rainfall during spring and summer. The climate is semi-arid. Water for farming and consumption {{was provided by}} summer rains, winter snowfall, and seeps and springs in and near the Mesa Verde villages. At , the middle mesa areas were typically ten degrees Fahrenheit (5.5°C) cooler than the mesa top, which reduced {{the amount of water}} needed for farming. The cliff dwellings were built to take advantage of solar energy. The angle of the sun in winter warmed the masonry of the cliff dwellings, warm breezes blew from the valley, and the air was ten to twenty degrees warmer in the canyon alcoves than {{on the top of the}} mesa. In the summer, with the sun high overhead, much of the village was protected from direct sunlight in the high cliff dwellings.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} breeds either {{alone or in}} small colonies {{averaging}} two to five nests in size, though nearly fifty nests are present at one site. It is monogamous and therefore does not breed with rockfowl other than its mate. It is believed to breed cooperatively in Equatorial Guinea, as four different birds were observed feeding one nest. The rockfowl's courtship displays are unknown. The timing of the egg laying in a colony is not synchronized, leading to various stages of development of nestlings within the colony. It {{has been suggested that}} this is to promote cooperative breeding. The laying dates also vary by region, typically coinciding with {{a few weeks before the}} onset of the wet season; in areas where the wet season is <b>bimodal,</b> two different breeding seasons occur. However, in mountainous regions such as Mount Cameroon, it breeds during the dry season to avoid the frequent mists of the wet season. Birds in Nigeria lay their eggs between August and November, birds in Gabon lay between November and April, birds in western Cameroon lay between March and November with peaks of June, July, and October, and birds in southern Cameroon have two breeding seasons, a main one from October to December and a secondary one lasting from April to May. In Equatorial Guinea, nesting occurs in mid-February.|$|E
25|$|Neuroscientific {{research}} on <b>bimodal</b> individuals—those who speak one oral language and one sign language—has been carried out. PET scans from these {{studies show that}} there is a separate region in the brain for working memory related to sign language production and use. These studies also find that <b>bimodal</b> individuals use different areas of the right hemisphere depending on whether they are speaking using verbal language or gesticulating using sign language. Studies with <b>bimodal</b> bilinguals have also provided insight into the tip of the tongue phenomenon and into patterns of neural activity when recognizing facial expressions.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has also}} been carried out into the {{neurology}} of <b>bimodal</b> bilinguals, or people who can speak one oral language and one sign language. Studies with <b>bimodal</b> bilinguals have also provided insight into {{the tip of the}} tongue phenomenon, working memory, and patterns of neural activity when recognizing facial expressions, signing, and speaking.|$|E
25|$|In {{case of a}} <b>bimodal</b> {{distribution}} (seen at right), it {{is useful}} to find out why this is the case. Two reference ranges can be established for the two different groups of people, making it possible to assume a normal distribution for each group. This <b>bimodal</b> pattern is commonly seen in tests that differ between men and women, such as prostate specific antigen.|$|E
25|$|DQA1*0102:DQB1*0502 has a <b>bimodal</b> distribution. It {{is found}} in the Philippines in high {{frequency}} and on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia.|$|E
25|$|In polyphasic sleep, an {{organism}} sleeps {{several times in}} a 24-hour cycle. Monophasic sleep occurs all at once. Under experimental conditions, humans tend to alternate more frequently between sleep and wakefulness (i.e., exhibit more polyphasic sleep) if they have nothing better to do. Given a 14-hour period of darkness in experimental conditions, humans tended towards <b>bimodal</b> sleep, with two sleep periods concentrated {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the dark time. <b>Bimodal</b> sleep in humans was more common before the industrial revolution.|$|E
25|$|The term omits {{characters}} showing {{continuous variation}} (such as weight), though {{this has a}} heritable component. Polymorphism deals with forms in which the variation is discrete (discontinuous) or strongly <b>bimodal</b> or polymodal.|$|E
25|$|This {{created the}} typical <b>bimodal</b> {{volcanic}} {{signature of the}} Cassidy Group and Pussycat Groups; the Tollu Group is a bit different, and it is considered {{the product of the}} large granite calderas which were formed immediately after the Giles Complex mamatism.|$|E
25|$|For many distributions, the {{standard}} deviation is not a particularly natural way of quantifying the structure. For example, uncertainty relations in {{which one of the}} observables is an angle has little physical meaning for fluctuations larger than one period. Other examples include highly <b>bimodal</b> distributions, or unimodal distributions with divergent variance.|$|E
25|$|VMS {{deposits}} {{associated with}} siliciclastic sedimentary rock dominated settings with abundant felsic rocks {{and less than}} 10% mafic material. These settings are often shale-rich siliciclastic-felsic or <b>bimodal</b> siliciclastic. The Bathurst camp, New Brunswick, Canada; Iberian Pyrite Belt, Spain and Portugal; and Finlayson Lake areas, Yukon, Canada are classic districts of this group.|$|E
25|$|The {{hanging wall}} to the deposit can be {{volcanic}} units essentially contiguous and coeval with the footwall rocks, indicating mineralisation was developed in an inter-eruptive pause; it may be volcanic rock dissimilar to the footwall volcanics in <b>bimodal</b> volcanic subtypes, {{or it could be}} sedimentary strata if mineralisation occurred toward the end of an eruptive cycle.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} theoretical studies {{of the distribution of}} fitness effects was done by Motoo Kimura, an influential theoretical population geneticist. His neutral theory of molecular evolution proposes that most novel mutations will be highly deleterious, with a small fraction being neutral. Hiroshi Akashi more recently proposed a <b>bimodal</b> model for the DFE, with modes centered around highly deleterious and neutral mutations. Both theories agree {{that the vast majority of}} novel mutations are neutral or deleterious and that advantageous mutations are rare, which has been supported by experimental results. One example is a study done on the DFE of random mutations in vesicular stomatitis virus. Out of all mutations, 39.6% were lethal, 31.2% were non-lethal deleterious, and 27.1% were neutral. Another example comes from a high throughput mutagenesis experiment with yeast. In this experiment it was shown that the overall DFE is <b>bimodal,</b> with a cluster of neutral mutations, and a broad distribution of deleterious mutations.|$|E
25|$|To {{be defined}} as bilingual, an {{individual}} need not have perfect fluency or equal skill in both languages. <b>Bimodal</b> bilinguals, like oral-language bilinguals, exhibit {{a wide range of}} language competency in their first and second languages. For Deaf people (the majority of <b>bimodal</b> bilinguals in the U.S.), level of competency in ASL and English may be influenced by factors such as degree of hearing loss, whether the individual is prelingually or post-lingually deaf, style of and language used in their education, and whether the individual comes from a hearing or Deaf family. Regardless of English competency in other areas, no Deaf individual is likely to comprehend English {{in the same way as}} a hearing person when others are speaking it because only a small percentage of English phonemes are clearly visible through lip reading. Additionally, many Deaf bilinguals who have fluency in written English choose not to speak it because of the general social unacceptability of their voices, or because they are unable to monitor factors like pitch and volume.|$|E
25|$|Various {{aspects of}} {{multilingualism}} {{have been studied}} {{in the field of}} neurology. These include the representation of different language systems in the brain, the effects of multilingualism on the brain's structural plasticity, aphasia in multilingual individuals, and <b>bimodal</b> bilinguals (people who can speak one sign language and one oral language). Neurological studies of multilingualism are carried out with functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and through observation of people who have suffered brain damage.|$|E
25|$|Sign {{language}} and oral language experience in <b>bimodal</b> bilinguals are {{shown to have}} separate effects on activation patterns within the superior temporal sulcus when recognizing facial expressions. Additionally, hearing signers (individuals who can hear and also speak sign language) do not show the strong left-lateralizated activation for facial expression recognition that has been found within deaf signers. This indicates that both sign language experience and deafness can affect the neural organization for recognizing facial expressions.|$|E
25|$|The written {{forms of}} {{language}} {{can be considered}} another modality. Sign languages do not have widely accepted written forms, so deaf individuals learn {{to read and write}} an oral language. This is known as sign–print bilingualism—a deaf individual has fluency in (at least) one sign language as their primary language and has literacy skills in the written form of (at least) one oral language, without access to other resources of the oral language that are gained through auditory stimuli. Orthographic systems employ the morphology, syntax, lexical choices, and often phonetic representation of their target language in at least superficial ways; one must learn these new features of the target language in order to read or write. In communities where there is standardized education for the deaf, such as the United States and the Netherlands, deaf individuals do gain skill sets in reading and writing in the oral language of the community. In such a state, bilingualism is achieved between a sign language and the written form of the community's oral language. In this view, all sign–print bilinguals are <b>bimodal</b> bilinguals, but all <b>bimodal</b> bilinguals may not be sign–print bilinguals.|$|E
25|$|Novae {{have some}} promise {{for use as}} {{standard}} candle measurements of distances. For instance, the distribution of their absolute magnitude is <b>bimodal,</b> with a main peak at magnitude −8.8, and a lesser one at −7.5. Novae also have roughly the same absolute magnitude 15 days after their peak (−5.5). Comparisons of nova-based distance estimates to various nearby galaxies and galaxy clusters with those measured with Cepheid variable stars, have shown them to be of comparable accuracy.|$|E
25|$|Infants {{are able}} to extract {{meaningful}} distinctions in the language {{they are exposed to}} from statistical properties of that language. For example, if English-learning infants are exposed to a prevoiced /d/ to voiceless unaspirated /t/ continuum (similar to the /d/ - /t/ distinction in Spanish) with the majority of the tokens occurring near the endpoints of the continuum, i.e., showing extreme prevoicing versus long voice onset times (<b>bimodal</b> distribution) they are better at discriminating these sounds than infants who are exposed primarily to tokens {{from the center of the}} continuum (unimodal distribution).|$|E
25|$|Studies in {{this area}} {{generally}} compare the behaviour or brain activity in normally hearing monolingual speakers of an oral language, genetically deaf, native signers, and normally hearing <b>bimodal</b> bilinguals. With the use of functional Near-Infrared Imaging (fNIR), Kovelman (2009) compared the performance and brain activity of these three groups in picture-naming tasks. These researchers found that, although performance in all groups was similar, neuroimaging revealed that bilinguals showed greater signal intensity within the posterior temporal regions (Wernicke's area) while using both languages in rapid alternation than when they were only using one language.|$|E
25|$|PET {{studies have}} {{revealed}} a language modality-specific working memory neural region for sign language (which {{relies on a}} network of bilateral temporal, bilateral parietal, and left premotor activation), {{as well as a}} difference in activation of the right cerebellum in <b>bimodal</b> bilinguals between when they are signing or speaking. Similarities of activation have been found in Broca's area and semantic retrieval causes similar patterns of activation in the anterior left inferior frontal lobe. The bilateral parietal activation pattern for sign language is similar to neural activity during nonverbal visuospatial tasks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bimodal</b> {{effect is}} a {{situation}} that bacterial cell in an intermediate size range are consumed more rapidly than the very large or the very small. The bacteria, which are smaller than 0.5 μm in diameter, are grazed by protists four to six times less than larger cells. Moreover, the filamentous cells or cells with diameters greater than 3 μm are often too large to ingest by protists or are grazed at substantially lower rates than smaller bacteria. The specific effects vary with the size ratio between predator and prey. Pernthaler et al. classified susceptible bacteria into four groups by rough size.|$|E
25|$|Distributional {{learning}} {{has also been}} found to help infants contrast two phonemes that they initially have difficulty in discriminating between. Maye, Weiss, and Aslin found that infants {{who were exposed to}} a <b>bimodal</b> distribution of a non-native contrast that was initially difficult to discriminate were better able to discriminate the contrast than infants exposed to a unimodal distribution of the same contrast. Maye et al. also found that infants were able to abstract features of a contrast (i.e., voicing onset time) and generalize that feature to the same type of contrast at a different place of articulation, a finding that has not been found in adults.|$|E
25|$|The {{jumping spider}} family (Salticidae) {{contains}} over 600 described genera {{and more than}} 5800 described species, making it the largest family of spiders with about 13% of all species. Jumping spiders {{have some of the}} best vision among arthropods and use it in courtship, hunting, and navigation. Although they normally move unobtrusively and fairly slowly, most species are capable of very agile jumps, notably when hunting, but sometimes in response to sudden threats or crossing long gaps. Both their book lungs and tracheal system are well-developed, and they use both systems (<b>bimodal</b> breathing). Jumping spiders are generally recognized by their eye pattern. All jumping spiders have four pairs of eyes, with the anterior median pair being particularly large.|$|E
25|$|Initiation of {{volcanism}} at Coso {{preceded the}} onset of Basin and Range crustal extension there, as expressed by normal faulting. The earlier of the two principal periods of volcanism began with the emplacement of basalt flows over a surface of little relief. Then, during the ensuing period of approximately 1.5 million years, eruptive activity included chemically more evolved rocks erupted upon a faulted terrain of substantial relief. Following a 1.5-million-year hiatus with few eruptions, a <b>bimodal</b> volcanic field of basalt lava flows and rhyolite lava domes and flows developed on Basin and Range terrain of essentially the same form as today's landscape. Many of the young basalt flows are intercanyon, occupying parts of the present-day drainage system.|$|E
25|$|In many ants and termites, on {{the other}} hand, workers vary in both size and bodily proportions, which have a <b>bimodal</b> distribution. This is present in {{approximately}} one in six ant genera. In most of these there are two developmentally distinct pathways, or castes, into which workers can develop. Typically members of the smaller caste are called minors {{and members of the}} larger caste are called majors or soldiers. There is often variation in size within each caste. The term soldiers may be apt, as in Cephalotes, but in many species members of the larger caste act primarily as foragers or food processors. In a few ant species, such as certain Pheidole species, there is a third caste, called supersoldiers.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} element isotopes that can sustain a fission chain reaction are called nuclear fuels, and {{are said to}} be fissile. The most common nuclear fuels are 235U (the isotope of uranium with an atomic mass of 235 and of use in nuclear reactors) and 239Pu (the isotope of plutonium with an atomic mass of 239). These fuels break apart into a <b>bimodal</b> range of {{chemical element}}s with atomic masses centering near 95 and 135u (fission products). Most nuclear fuels undergo spontaneous fission only very slowly, decaying instead mainly via an alpha-beta decay chain over periods of millennia to eons. In a nuclear reactor or nuclear weapon, the overwhelming majority of fission events are induced by bombardment with another particle, a neutron, which is itself produced by prior fission events.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bimodal</b> bilinguals are {{individuals}} who are fluent in both sign language and oral language. The effect of this language experience on the brain compared to brain regions in monolinguals or bilinguals of oral languages has only recently become a research interest, but is now used to provide insight on syntactic integration and language control of bilinguals. PET scans of a 37-year-old, right handed, bilingual (English and American Sign Language) male with left frontal lobe damage revealed evidence of increased right hemisphere activity compared to normal controls during spontaneous generation of narrative in both English and American Sign Language (ASL). Research with fMRI has found that showing sign language to deaf and hearing signers and showing written English to hearing non-signers activates the classical language areas of the left hemisphere in both cases.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} found that two {{converging}} <b>bimodal</b> stimuli can produce a perception that is not only different in magnitude {{than the sum of its}} parts, but also quite different in quality. In a classic study labeled the McGurk effect, a person's phoneme production was dubbed with a video of that person speaking a different phoneme. The end result was the perception of a third, different phoneme. McGurk and MacDonald (1976) explained that phonemes such as ba, da, ka, ta, ga and pa can be divided into four groups, those that can be visually confused, i.e. (da, ga, ka, ta) and (ba and pa), and those that can be audibly confused. Hence, when ba – voice and ga lips are processed together, the visual modality sees ga or da, and the auditory modality hears ba or da, combining to form the percept da.|$|E
