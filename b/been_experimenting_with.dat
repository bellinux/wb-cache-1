5|$|The Airborne Group had <b>been</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> {{microwave}} {{systems as}} early as 1938 after discovering that a suitable arrangement of the acorn tubes could be operated at wavelengths as short as 30cm. However, these had very low output, and operated well within the region of reduced sensitivity on the receiver side, so detection ranges were very short. The group gave up on further development for the time being.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Harlow murders {{a biology}} professor, cuts out an organ and disposes {{of it in}} a furnace. After the Gunmen capture her, she reveals that he had <b>been</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> the immune system of sharks and had been {{grafting}} pieces of shark onto his body in order to become a living host to a biological weapon. His research had been funded by Yves's arms dealing father, who had commissioned Fletcher to find her and prevent her from stopping his biological terrorism plot. She further informs them that there is another host, whom she is trying to identify and locate before he can unleash his deadly payload.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{score was}} written, co-produced and {{composed}} by English singer and songwriter Peter Gabriel. It marked his first {{work on a}} feature film, {{as well as his}} first collaboration with music producer Daniel Lanois. Parker first met Gabriel during the film's post-production, as he had <b>been</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> his music, incorporating the percussive rhythms from the musician's solo albums into the film. Parker contacted Gabriel's manager, record producer David Geffen, who advised him that producing the soundtrack would be a slow process, as Gabriel was known for working at his own pace. While working on his fifth studio album So, Gabriel agreed to score Birdy after viewing a rough cut of the film.|$|E

25|$|Diasporic Africans in the Americas have <b>been</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> ways {{to style}} their hair since their {{arrival in the}} Western Hemisphere well before the 19th century.

25|$|He {{took out}} a patent for chain-making in 1816, and {{patented}} wrought iron chain links suitable for a suspension bridge in 1817. In the same year, others built Dryburgh Bridge, the first chain-supported bridge in Britain. Brown had <b>been</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> a chain-supported suspension bridge already, building a 32m span test structure in 1813.|$|E

25|$|It is {{astonishing}} {{what he and}} Tottola achieved in so short a time: a complex and sophisticated theatrical structure, an unusually rich vein of dramatically viable melody, exquisite orchestrations, and a striking use {{of the kind of}} off-stage effects Rossini had <b>been</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> in the royal pageants of Ricciardo e Zoraide.|$|E

25|$|The Airborne Group had <b>been</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> {{microwave}} {{systems as}} early as 1938 after discovering that a suitable arrangement of the RCA acorn tubes could be operated at wavelengths as low as 30cm. However, these had very low output, {{and on top of}} this, the receiver's electronics were not very sensitive at these frequencies. This resulted in very short detection ranges, essentially useless. The group gave up on further development for the time being, and Bowen described the topic being pooh-poohed by the engineers for some time.|$|E
25|$|Several {{species in}} the Schizosaccharomyces genus use L-malic acid, and enologists have been {{exploring}} the potential of using this wine yeast for deacidifying wines instead of the traditional route of malolactic fermentation with bacteria. However, early results with Schizosaccharomyces pombe have shown a tendency of the yeast to produce off odors and unpleasant sensory characteristics in the wine. In recent years, enologists have <b>been</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> a mutant strain of Schizosaccharomyces malidevorans that {{has so far been}} shown to produce less potential wine flaws and off odors.|$|E

Short then developed his device, and in 1879 patented and sold it.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of television, the ABC had been using Lissajous figures as fillers {{in-between}} programs. A staff competition was conducted in 1963 to create a new logo for use on television, stationery, publications, microphone badges and ABC vehicles. Graphic designer, Bill Kennard, who had <b>been</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> telerecording of the Cathode Ray Oscillograph displays, submitted a design in 1965 which was part of the waveform of an oscilloscope. The letters A-B-C were added to the wavelength design and it was adopted as the ABC's official logo. Mr Kennard was paid twenty five pounds for his design.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} {{members of the}} expedition begin to explore. Victoria and Kaftan discover a chamber with a sarcophagus-like wall inset facing a projection device that was apparently used to revitalise the Cybermen. She curiously climbs inside, and Kaftan secretly seals her in the sarcophagus and tries to activate the projector but the Doctor frees her, suspecting Kaftan is to blame. Meanwhile, Haydon and Jamie have <b>been</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> a control panel in another room; a Cyberman emerges and a gun fires, killing Haydon. However, the Doctor works {{out that it is}} not a real Cyberman, but a testing range for weapons.|$|E
