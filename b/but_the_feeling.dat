500|$|Scientists, Ruse argues, {{continue}} to slide easily from one notion of progress to another: even committed Darwinians like Richard Dawkins embed {{the idea of}} cultural progress in a theory of cultural units, memes, that act much like genes. Dawkins can speak of [...] "progressive rather than random... trends in evolution". Dawkins and John Krebs deny the [...] "earlier [...] prejudice" [...] that there is anything [...] "inherently progressive about evolution", <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of progress comes from evolutionary arms races which remain in Dawkins's words [...] "by far the most satisfactory explanation {{for the existence of}} the advanced and complex machinery that animals and plants possess".|$|E
500|$|David Hayter, Stan Lee, and Tom DeSanto make cameo appearances. George Buza, {{the voice}} of Beast in , {{appeared}} as the truck driver who drops Rogue off at the bar at which Wolverine fights. Other cameo appearances include Sumela Kay as Kitty Pryde, Katrina Florece as Jubilee, Donald MacKinnon as a young Colossus sketching a picture in one scene, and Alexander Burton as Pyro. Gambit was considered {{for one of the}} students at the X-Mansion. Singer remembered, [...] "We thought about Gambit as the young boy on the basketball field, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> was that if he has the basketball and then releases it and it exploded, [...] people would be like 'What's wrong with those basketballs?'" [...] Kevin Feige had a cameo as a Weapon X tech, but his scenes did not make the final cut of the film.|$|E
500|$|... "Call My Name" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Bill Lamb of About.com explained that, after many believed that rejecting her judge {{role on the}} US version of The X Factor in 2011 would be a career setback, {{the release of the}} [...] "hot, current dance pop" [...] track proved them wrong. Writing for the same website, DJ Ron Slomowicz stated that, despite being [...] "a little generic" [...] when compared to mainstream tracks, [...] "there's still something undeniably catchy about the track." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy rated [...] "Call My Name" [...] four out of five stars, and added: [...] "unsurprisingly, is a ballsy dance anthem about an elusive lover complete with a foot-stomping trance section that becomes more addictive with each listen." [...] Copsey also added that it isn't the [...] "greatest song of all time, nor the most original you'll hear this year, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> we get from it more than makes up for it." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator said that, despite not being innovative, the song has catchy hooks and melodies that [...] "manage to grab you from the first listen, no matter how familiar they might sound." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1985, DC Comics {{introduced}} a storyline titled Crisis on Infinite Earths. That company-wide story arc erased the established history {{of almost all}} DC Comic's characters. Bizarra was then re-{{introduced a}}s part of an all new Bizarro Justice League team (which included Bizarro, Batzarro, Bizarro Flash, Bizarro Hawkgirl, and Bizarro Yellow Lantern). They live on the cube-shaped planet Htrae which is populated entirely with Bizarro-type humans. At one point, Bizarro Hawkgirl tied up Bizarra (in that story referred to as [...] "Wonder Woman") with her own lasso. It was explained that Bizarra's lasso had the ability to force anyone tied by it to tell only lies. Bizarra seemed to be romantically interested in Bizarro <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> was not shared as Bizarro was in love with his world's version of Lois Lane only. During the storyline, it was shown that due to exposure to Htrae's blue sun, Bizarro gained the ability to create new Bizarro life-forms. Whether Bizarra was created by Bizarro or was a pre-existing character is unclear.|$|E
2500|$|Mikael Wood for the Los Angeles Times {{enjoyed the}} first Gibson Amphitheatre concert, writing that it [...] "had the triumphant, {{sometimes}} self-satisfied {{feel of a}} victory lap." [...] MTV's Aimee Curran also gave the concert a positive review, writing: [...] "The cast {{was able to make}} every song their own while still managing to maintain the original artist's integrity." [...] Hahn Nguyen of Zap2it wrote: [...] "seeing it live is well worth the money and effort. Not only is there an elevated, infectious energy you don't get from just watching the show at home, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of togetherness can't be matched." [...] and [...] "One can truly hear the quality of the live vocals, which in the case of Lea Michele is the real deal. She sounds even better than on the show...Her [...] "Don't Rain on My Parade" [...] live is an amazing and thrilling treat." [...] Variety Andrew Barker gave a less favorable review, writing: [...] "while its distinctive blend of high camp and recognizable tunes may click on the small screen, when translated to stage the conceit becomes little more than a frantic, under-imagined jukeboxer, and only occasionally a well-performed one. Four-city tour will likely rake in the cash and merit a reprise, but whether it deserves it is a different matter." [...] Though he did, again, note Riley's [...] "solid" [...] performances and calling Lea Michele [...] "the most obvious pro" [...] claiming her songs were performed [...] "with power and presence". [...] "Wisely, the producers never left either woman offstage for long."" ...|$|E

500|$|The first-person {{protagonist of}} Ms. Welch’s song ("Caleb Meyer") {{may be a}} young girl from {{a time and place}} that Ms. Welch will never fully understand, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>the</b> singer expresses about rape, and the respect she {{displays}} for her chosen musical genre, are nothing if not poignantly authentic.
