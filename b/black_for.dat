Watts contacts <b>Black</b> <b>for</b> help with the case. However, Black is still recovering from the murder of his friend Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich), who was murdered in Black's home. Watts hangs up when he sees Sammael looking through the house's window, {{but by the time he}} can investigate, Sammael is gone.|$|E
5|$|Confederate Army {{officers}} {{indicated their}} military affiliation with different colored facing on their coats or jackets. The colors were red for artillery, yellow for cavalry, light blue for infantry, and <b>black</b> <b>for</b> medical. A very distinctive {{feature of the}} Confederate officers uniforms was the gold braid Austrian knots on their sleeves. More elaborate braiding indicated higher rank and some knots almost reached the shoulder. However, a general order, issued in 1862, called for the Austrian knots not to be worn in the field, as this made officers conspicuous to enemy combatants.|$|E

5|$|Poe {{may also}} have been drawing upon various {{references}} to ravens in mythology and folklore. In Norse mythology, Odin possessed two ravens named Huginn and Muninn, representing thought and memory. According to Hebrew folklore, Noah sends a white raven to check conditions while on the ark. It learns that the floodwaters are beginning to dissipate, but it does not immediately return with the news. It is punished by being turned black and being forced to feed on carrion forever. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, a raven also begins as white before Apollo punishes it by turning it <b>black</b> <b>for</b> delivering a message of a lover's unfaithfulness. The raven's role as a messenger in Poe's poem may draw from those stories.|$|E

Essentially the same game as the original, they tell the same story of Ryu and the Dark Dragon Blade, but include additional content and updated game mechanics. Itagaki deemed Black {{to be the final}} version of Ninja Gaiden, but with the release of the PS3, Tecmo ported the game to this platform as Sigma.|$|E
5|$|The British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service used <b>black</b> <b>for</b> night bombers, while a {{wide variety}} of {{experimental}} camouflages were tried out for specific roles such as trench strafing, with multiple colors. Alternatives were tested in late 1917 at Orfordness Experimental Station, resulting in NIVO (Night Invisible Varnish Orfordness) being introduced in early 1918, used for all external surfaces on night bombers until superseded by World War II colors.|$|E
5|$|The {{base coat}} of the jaguar is {{generally}} a tawny yellow, but can range to reddish-brown and <b>black,</b> <b>for</b> {{most of the}} body. However, the ventral areas are white. The cat is covered in rosettes for camouflage in the dappled light of its forest habitat. The spots vary over individual coats and between individual jaguars: rosettes may include one or several dots, and {{the shapes of the}} dots vary. The spots on the head and neck are generally solid, as are those on the tail, where they may merge to form a band.|$|E

5|$|The film's visual style {{includes}} abrupt cuts, rapid camera movement, extensive superimposition, dim lighting, {{and shapes}} and forms in twisted and disoriented angles. Filmed {{with a budget}} of only $97 ($ in today's dollars), it includes a combination of close-ups of live actors and long shots of miniature sets, which were made from such items as cardboard, paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, and toy trains. With no access to Hollywood studios or equipment, most of the filming {{took place in the}} filmmakers' residences, with walls painted <b>black</b> <b>for</b> use as a background.|$|E
5|$|Twelve years later, Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is {{visited by}} a retired Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, Richard Gilbert (Glenn Morshower). Gilbert hopes to headhunt <b>Black</b> <b>for</b> his new private {{security}} firm, The Trust. Their meeting abruptly ends when Black receives word {{that his father}} has died. At the funeral, Black explains the notion of death to his young daughter; later that day, he unsuccessfully tries to contact fellow Group member Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), {{with whom he has}} lost contact.|$|E
5|$|Georgia State {{opened the}} second half with a drive to the Alabama 36-yard line {{to set up a}} school record 53-yard field goal by Wil Lutz. Alabama responded with a 68-yard march that ended in a {{touchdown}} pass from Blake Sims to Chris <b>Black</b> <b>for</b> a 45–3 lead. With the score at 45–3, neither team scored again. After a Panthers punt, Alabama's next drive ended with Crimson Tide backup kicker Adam Griffith missing a 30-yard field goal. Before his exit late in the second quarter, McCarron set the Alabama record for passing accuracy at 93.75%, going 15–16 and surpassed the previous record of 84.2% held by Ken Stabler. With the win, Alabama improved its all-time record against Georgia State to 2–0.|$|E

5|$|On 8 January 1536, news of Catherine of Aragon's death {{reached the}} King and Anne, who were overjoyed. The {{following}} day, Henry and Anne wore yellow, {{the symbol of}} joy and celebration in England, from head to toe, and celebrated Catherine's death with festivities. In Spain, the home country of Catherine of Aragon, yellow was the colour of mourning, in addition to <b>black.</b> <b>For</b> this reason, the wearing of yellow by Henry and Anne {{may have been a}} symbol of mourning. With Mary's mother dead, Anne attempted to make peace with her. Mary rebuffed Anne's overtures, perhaps because of rumours circulating that Catherine had been poisoned by Anne or Henry. These began after the discovery during her embalming that her heart was blackened. Modern medical experts are in agreement that this was not the result of poisoning, but of cancer of the heart, something which was not understood at the time.|$|E
5|$|On June 14, 1832, Cadron-Jetté's husband Jean-Marie died of cholera, one of {{many victims}} of that year's cholera epidemic, leaving Cadron-Jetté widowed. Cadron-Jetté responded to her husband's death by vowing to be in mourning, or wear <b>black,</b> <b>for</b> the {{remainder}} of her life. At that time, Cadron-Jetté's eldest two sons, Jean-Marie and Pierre (20 and 17 years old, respectively), were employed as shoemakers, and the eldest daughter, Rose (19) was engaged (and was married in July 1833), while Cadron-Jetté's other four surviving children still required Cadron-Jetté's care, as did Cadron-Jetté's elderly mother. It was not until 1838, {{following the death of}} Cadron-Jetté's mother and the maturity or death of her remaining children, that she found herself with time free to devote to charitable activities.|$|E
5|$|While on {{the move}} the lead {{vehicles}} of the patrol commanders and sergeants flew a small flag. Because the LRP was organised on divisional cavalry lines the leaders carried green flags for 'A' (HQ) Troop, <b>black</b> <b>for</b> 'B' Troop, yellow for 'C' Troop and red for 'D'. When the LRDG was organised into 11 vehicle patrols this was simplified to a green flag displaying the patrol letter in white; the later half-patrols used a plain green flag on occasion. When it became necessary to change course from an intended route, or {{in the event of}} enemy action, patrol movements were controlled by a simple semaphore flag system using blue and white signal flags, or hand signals, depending on how widely dispersed the trucks were.|$|E
