5|$|Little says Rosenberg was {{influenced}} by Erich Fromm, George Albee, and George Miller to adopt a community focus in his work, moving away from clinical psychological practice. The central ideas influencing this shift by Rosenberg were that: (1) individual mental health depends on the social structure of a community (Fromm), (2) therapists alone are unable to meet the psychological needs of a community (Albee), and (3) knowledge about human <b>behavior</b> <b>will</b> increase if psychology is freely given to the community (Miller).|$|E
25|$|Social {{learning}} {{theory suggests that}} people learn from observing and modeling after others' behavior. With positive reinforcement, the behavior continues. If one observes violent behavior, one {{is more likely to}} imitate it. If there are no negative consequences (e. g. victim accepts the violence, with submission), then the <b>behavior</b> <b>will</b> likely continue.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis of}} Fourier's work was his clear {{conception}} and definition of thermal conductivity. He assumed that, all else being the same, the flux of heat is strictly {{proportional to the}} gradient of temperature. Although undoubtedly true for small temperature gradients, strictly proportional <b>behavior</b> <b>will</b> be lost when real materials (e.g. ones having a thermal conductivity that {{is a function of}} temperature) are subjected to large temperature gradients.|$|E

25|$|Expectancy theory posits {{employee}} satisfaction to be {{an outcome}} of performance rather than the cause of performance. However, if a pattern is established whereas an employee understands his performance will lead to certain desired rewards, an employee's motivation can be strengthened based on anticipation. If the employees foresee a high probability that they can successfully carry out a desired behavior, and that their <b>behavior</b> <b>will</b> lead to a valued outcome, then they will direct their efforts toward that end.|$|E
25|$|Value-added Theory - Neil Smelser (1962) {{argues that}} {{collective}} behavior {{is actually a}} sort of release valve for built-up tension ("strain") within the social system, community, or group. If the proper determinants are present then collective behavior becomes inevitable. Conversely, {{if any of the}} key determinants are not present no collective <b>behavior</b> <b>will</b> occur unless and until the missing determinants fall into place. These are primarily social, although physical factors such as location and weather may also contribute to or hinder the development of collective behavior.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{requirements}} build upon {{the first step}} in the pyramid: physiology. If there are deficits on this level, all <b>behavior</b> <b>will</b> be oriented to satisfy this deficit. Essentially, if you have not slept or eaten adequately, you won't be interested in your self-esteem desires. Subsequently, we have the second level, which awakens a need for security. After securing those two levels, the motives shift to the social sphere, the third level. Psychological requirements comprise the fourth level, while the top of the hierarchy consists of self-realization and self-actualization.|$|E

25|$|According to Cloninger’s model, {{the early}} life onset of neuropsychiatric {{disorders}} lead to personality disorders, with individuals having low RD scores. Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) is characterized in behavioral terms by childhood or adolescent onset of recurrent antisocial behavior. Cloninger had predicted from his biosocial theory that individuals {{most at risk}} of aggressive, antisocial <b>behavior,</b> <b>will</b> be those with lower RD scores and these individuals are equated with the primary psychopaths who show aloofness and social detachment. Particular research conducted on childhood behavior has tested this theory and researchers have shown that children with lower RD scores have more of an anti-social profile as defined in the DSM, and are at highest risk for early onset of frequent delinquent behavior.|$|E
25|$|The average {{prairie dog}} {{territory}} takes up 0.05–1.01 hectares. Territories have well-established borders that coincide with physical barriers such as rocks and trees. The resident male of a territory defends it and antagonistic <b>behavior</b> <b>will</b> occur between two males of different families {{to defend their}} territories. These interactions may happen 20 times per day and last five minutes. When two prairie dogs encounter {{each other at the}} edges of their territories, they will start staring, make bluff charges, flare their tails, chatter their teeth, and sniff each other's perianal scent glands. When fighting, prairie dogs will bite, kick and ram each other. If their competitor is around their size or smaller, the females will participate in fighting. Otherwise, if a competitor is sighted, the females signal for the resident male.|$|E
25|$|Both {{indirect}} reciprocity {{and costly}} signaling {{depend on the}} value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions. One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping <b>behavior</b> <b>will</b> be communicated to people they will interact with later, is publicly announced, is discussed, or is simply being observed by someone else. This have been documented in many studies. The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen. Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects. Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic. People who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns.|$|E
40|$|Unhealthy {{behaviors}} {{are a major}} part of the health profile in the United States and other developed countries. A famous article by J. Michael McGinnis, and William H. Foege (1993) estimated that half of all deaths in the United States are due to unhealthy behaviors, most importantly tobacco use, poor diet and exercise, and excessive alcohol consumption. Even this excludes many health-harming behaviors such as passing up recommended screening tests, discontinuing medication usage, and not following up on physician referrals. Why do people not do the right thing for their health? The prevailing economic paradigm for understanding these forms of behavior is that health {{behaviors are}} investments, where foregone current pleasure leads to improvements in future well-being (Michael Grossman, 1972). As such, variations in health <b>behaviors</b> <b>will</b> be explained by differences in discount rates or the value of life. If this theory is right, health <b>behaviors</b> <b>will</b> differ across people, but for a given person, <b>behaviors</b> <b>will</b> be highly correlated: those who value their health highly and care sufficiently about the future will have much better behaviors than those who do not. Table 1 shows the correlation of five different health measures, drawn from the 199...|$|R

50|$|According to Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, {{the third}} Chabad Rebbe, by {{assuming}} the demeanor and mannerisms {{of one who}} is joyful, even if the one practicing these actions does not feel happy, such <b>behaviors</b> <b>will</b> lead to true feelings of happiness, because behaviors and actions impact the heart.|$|R
25|$|In operant conditioning, {{the type}} and {{frequency}} of behavior is determined mainly by its consequences. If a certain behavior, {{in the presence of}} a certain stimulus, is followed by a desirable consequence (a reinforcer), the emitted <b>behavior</b> <b>will</b> increase in frequency in the future, in the presence of the stimulus that preceded the behavior (or a similar one). Conversely, if the behavior is followed by something undesirable (a punisher), the behavior is less likely to occur in the presence of the stimulus. In a similar manner, removal of a stimulus directly following the behavior might either increase or decrease the frequency of that behavior in the future (negative reinforcement or punishment). For instance, a student that gained praise and a good grade after turning in a paper, might seem more motivated in writing papers in the future (positive reinforcement); if the same student put in a lot of work on a task without getting any praise for it, he or she might seem less motivated to do school work in the future (negative punishment). If a student starts to cause trouble in class gets punished with something he or she dislikes, such as detention (positive punishment), that behavior would decrease in the future. The student might seem more motivated to behave in class, presumably in order to avoid further detention (negative reinforcement).|$|E
500|$|According to Larry Gostin, {{the root}} cause of the problem was the State itself.

Players must also keep track of their health and ammunition in order to succeed in combat.|$|E

In order to answer the aforementioned questions, a focus group of OLS seniors was created and allowed to compile their own list of behaviors deemed necessary to measure teamwork dynamics. Using this list, the students were instructed to develop a rubric to measure teamwork dynamics. The results were then compared to relevant literature, specifically Hoegl and Gemuenden’s Teamwork Quality Construct (TWQ) which measures the quality of teamwork collaboration.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of energy efficient driving styles and practices, eco-driving, {{has been recognized}} in the literature as an option for reducing vehicle energy consumption.

An eco-driving intervention intended to increase eco-driving behaviors in a work organization was conducted with fleet drivers in three public organizations.
