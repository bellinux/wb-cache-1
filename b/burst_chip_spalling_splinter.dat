40|$|Among {{the several}} {{machining}} processes, drilling {{is one of}} the most frequently used for the hole production for screws, rivets and bolts. Drilling of composite materials causes several damage modes, such as: delamination, fiber-pull out, edge <b>chipping,</b> <b>spalling,</b> uncut fibers, surface roughness and dimensional errors, and others. Delamination is a major problem associated with drilling fiber reinforced composite materials. It causes poor assembly tolerance, reduces structural integrity of material and the potential for long term performance deterioration. The thrust force has been cited as main cause of delamination. In this paper the objective was to establish correlation between cutting tool geometry, cutting velocity and feed rate with delamination during drilling carbon fibre reinforced composite materials. Drilling test were carried out on carbon epoxy composites using different twist drills...|$|R

40|$|In June 2005, the NESC {{received}} a multi-faceted request {{to determine the}} long term reliability of fiber optic termini on the ISS that exhibited flaws not manufactured to best workmanship practices. There {{was a lack of}} data related to fiber optic workmanship as it affects the long term reliability of optical fiber assemblies in a harsh environment. A fiber optic defect analysis was requested which would find and/or create various types of <b>chips,</b> <b>spalls,</b> scratches, etc., that were identified by the ISS personnel. Once the defects and causes were identified the next step would be to perform long term reliability testing of similar assemblies with similar defects. The goal of the defect analysis would be for the defects to be observed and documented for deterioration of fiber optic performance. Though this report mostly discusses what has been determined as evidence of poor manufacturing processes, it also concludes the majority of the damage could have been avoided with a rigorous process in place...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{potential}} for aeolian abrasion of natural dune sands to produce fine dust particles. Particular attention is given to how the particle size, sorting, colour, shape {{and the presence of}} iron oxide coatings and clay skins affect the rate of dust production. Natural dune sand samples were obtained from the crests of active continental dunes from the Simpson Desert and the Channel Country and abraded for 72 hours using a large glass 'test-tube' chamber. The <b>chipping,</b> <b>spalling</b> and breakage of sand grains and the removal of iron oxide coatings and clay skins from grain surfaces produced between 0. 41 - 0. 98 % fine particles. Statistical analysis identified that the degree of sorting and grain roundness of a sand sample are the major influences on the dust production rate. Well-sorted, sub-rounded sand samples yielded less dust than poorly sorted angular sand grains. Comparison with previous studies of aeolian abrasion of crushed quartz sands, these natural dune sands produced very low quantities of fine material, but the widespread geographical distribution of desert dune fields makes them potentially a significant source of dust-sized particles on a global scale...|$|R
50|$|The ISU-152 {{could also}} operate as an {{effective}} heavy tank destroyer. Though it was not designed for the role, the vehicle inherited the nickname Zveroboy ("beast killer") from its predecessor, the SU-152, {{for its ability to}} reliably kill the best protected German fighting vehicles; the Panther tank, the Tiger and King Tiger tanks, and even the rarely fielded Elefant and Jagdtiger tank destroyers. The sheer weight of the 152.4 mm shells resulted in an extremely low rate of fire, only one to three rounds per minute, and were not as accurate at long range as high-velocity tank antitank guns. However, the massive blast effect from the heavy high-explosive warhead was capable of blowing the turret completely off a Tiger tank. A direct hit usually destroyed or damaged the target's tracks and suspension, immobilizing it. While the low-velocity 152mm shell did not generally penetrate heavy armor, it frequently killed or severely wounded the crew through <b>spalling</b> (<b>splintering)</b> inside the hull as well as injuries caused by blast concussion. Surviving crew were often left with an immobilized vehicle which had to be hurriedly abandoned before being destroyed. For anti-tank operations following the Battle of Kursk, armour-piercing ammunition was developed, with an eye towards giving the howitzer a more traditional anti-tank capability. However, these rounds were expensive, in short supply, and only moderately more effective than the standard non-penetrating high-explosive round. As a howitzer the ML-20S exchanged velocity and accuracy for throw weight and distance, and was not intended to compete with true anti-tank guns. Sometimes the concrete-piercing ammunition was used for the anti-tank role. A primitive shaped charge ammunition, with a 27.44 kg shell, was also developed. It had a maximum penetration of 250 mm of RHA at 90°, but it was not used during the war.|$|R
40|$|Hard CrNx {{coatings}} {{of various}} composition were deposited on {{hot work tool steel}} {{by means of}} reactive sputter deposition in an industrial PVD reactor. All deposited coatings (thickness 3 - 4 micron) were under compressive stress. The coatings were subjected to scratch testing with a diamond stylus. Two critical loads were determined. The first critical load, Lc 1, indicates the onset of <b>chipping</b> and/or <b>spalling.</b> The second critical load, Lc 2, indicates complete coating removal inside the track. Micrographs showing the coating failure are presented. Stoichiomeric CrN coatings outperform understoichiometric CrN 0. 6 coatings in scratch tests. It was found that for all specimens the coating-to-substrate adhesion is very good, independent on composition. Although the values of Lc 1 and Lc 2 are distinctly different, their dependence on composition is similar...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: A polymer {{infiltrated}} ceramic network (PICN) and a resin nano ceramic (RNC) restorative {{materials for}} Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) applications recently became commercially available. Little independent evidence regarding their mechanical properties exists to facilitate material selection process. The {{purpose of this}} study was to measure the edge chipping resistance and flexural strength of the novel PICN and RNC materials and compare it to two commonly used feldspathic ceramic (FC) and leucite reinforced glass-ceramic (LRGC) CAD/CAM materials that share the same indications. Materials and Methods: For the edge chipping test, 20 specimens/group were tested. Square prism specimens 10 10 2 mm were sectioned from the commercially available CAD/CAM blocks, polished and adhesively attached on a 4 mm thick resin bed fabricated in a custom holder. A 120 degree sharp conical indenter was mounted on a universal testing machine and the specimens edge was positioned in distances varying from 0. 1 mm to 0. 7 mm horizontally from the indenter tip. Two edge chipping tests were performed per sample at a crosshead speed of 0. 1 mm/min and the critical force at which a <b>chip</b> <b>spalled</b> off the edge was recorded. One-way ANOVA determined intergroup differences (f¿=. 05). For the flexural strength test, 22 specimens/group were tested. Beam specimens 18 4 1. 2 mm were sectioned from the commercially available CAD/CAM blocks and polished. A 3 -point flexure test was performed on a universal testing machine with a test fixture support span of 15 mm and the crosshead speed set at 0. 5 mm/min. Weibull statistics determined intergroup differences (f¿=. 05). Flexural modulus and work of fracture were also measured and one-way ANOVA determined intergroup differences (f¿=. 05). Results: Regarding edge chipping resistance, one-way ANOVA revealed significant differences with the materials ranking RNC 3 ̆eLRGC=FC 3 ̆ePICN (P=. 05). Regarding flexural strength, Weibull statistics revealed significant differences with the materials ranking RNC=LRGC 3 ̆ePICN 3 ̆eFC (P=. 05). Regarding flexural modulus one-way ANOVA revealed significant differences between the 4 materials, which ranked RNC LRGC=PICN 3 ̆eFC (P=. 05). Conclusions: The RNC material demonstrated superior results for all the mechanical properties tested compared to the other 3 materials. Randomized controlled trials to determine clinical success are warranted for the RNC material...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringThough {{composites}} {{are commonly}} molded for achieving near net-shape, {{they have to}} undergo precise machining {{in order to achieve}} the dimensional stability and an interface quality. A complicated interaction between polymer matrix and carbon fiber reinforcement makes the machining of the CFRP material a major concern. Due to this heterogeneous nature of the CFRP, the machined surfaces result in damages like delamination, <b>spalling,</b> and <b>splintering.</b> In order to minimize these damages, knowledge about tool replacement time or tool life is necessary. In this study an effort is made to determine the tool life for diamond interlocked knurled tool commonly used for machining CFRP material. Direct tool wear measurement techniques were inadequate to determine the tool life because of the complex geometry of this tool. Therefore, in this study indirect tool wear measurement technique is used to quantify the tool wear based on delamination. The damage caused by delamination on the CFRP material undergoing edge trimming operation is measured in the form of delamination depth as well as number of delamination occurrences per inch. The effects of experimental parameters on delamination depth as well as number of delamination occurrences per inch are observed to find optimized process parameters. An attempt is made to develop an empirical tool lie equation based on the combined effect of delamination depth and number of delamination occurrences per inch...|$|R
5000|$|In archaeology, a lithic flake is a [...] "portion of rock {{removed from}} an {{objective}} piece by percussion or pressure," [...] {{and may also}} {{be referred to as}} a <b>chip</b> or <b>spall,</b> or collectively as debitage. The objective piece, or the rock being reduced by the removal of flakes, is known as a core. Once the proper tool stone has been selected, a percussor or pressure flaker (e.g., an antler tine) is used to direct a sharp blow, or apply sufficient force, respectively, {{to the surface of the}} stone, often on the edge of the piece. The energy of this blow propagates through the material, often (but not always) producing a Hertzian cone of force which causes the rock to fracture in a controllable fashion. Since cores are often struck on an edge with a suitable angle (x<90°) for flake propagation, the result is that only a portion of the Hertzian cone is created. The process continues as the flintknapper detaches the desired number of flakes from the core, which is marked with the negative scars of these removals. The surface area of the core which received the blows necessary for detaching the flakes is referred to as the striking platform.|$|R
40|$|Hard CrNx {{coatings}} of 3. 3 - 4. 1 mu m in thickness were deposited {{by means}} of reactive sputter deposition in an industrial PVD coater. The coatings were deposited under various N- 2 flows on high-speed steel (HSS) and {{hot work tool steel}} (HWTS). For all coatings, the hardness, reduced modulus and density were approximately 30 GPa, 240 GPa and 6400 kg /m(3), respectively. The composition, however, varied with the N- 2 flow from CrN 0. 6 to CrN 1. 0. The coatings were subjected to scratch testing with a diamond Rockwell stylus under a progressive load. From the scratch tests, the critical load for the onset of <b>chipping</b> and/or <b>spalling</b> for each coating was determined. The tribological properties of the coatings were characterised by pin-on-disk testing employing an Al 2 O 3 ball as counter part. The wear track depth profile measured with a laser scanning confocal microscope was used to obtain the wear area. From the wear area, the specific wear rate was determined. The CrN 1. 0 coatings outperform the CrN 0. 6 coatings with respect to specific wear rate and critical load. For the CrN 0. 6 coating, similar failure was observed in both the wear test and the scratch tests. The similarity of failure in both tests is discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A {{new test}} method based on multi-pass scratch testing has been {{developed}} for evaluating the mechanical and tribological properties of thin, hard coatings. The proposed test method uses a pin-on-disc tribometer and during testing a Rockwell C diamond stylus is used as the “pin” and loaded against the rotating coated sample. The influence of normal load {{on the number of}} cycles to coating damage is investigated and the resulting coating damage mechanisms are evaluated by post-test scanning electron microscopy. The present study presents the test method by evaluating the performance of Ti 0. 86 Si 0. 14 N, Ti 0. 34 Al 0. 66 N and (Al 0. 7 Cr 0. 3) 2 O 3 coatings deposited by cathodic arc evaporation on cemented carbide inserts.   The results show that the test method is quick, simple and reproducible and can preferably be used to obtain relevant data concerning the fatigue, wear, <b>chipping</b> and <b>spalling</b> characteristics of different coating-substrate composites. Also, the small size of the test region (the radius of the circular scratch track can be as small as 0. 5 mm) makes it possible to perform tests within small restricted areas. Consequently, the test method {{can be used as a}} virtually non-destructive test and e. g. be used to evaluate the fatigue and wear resistance as well as the cohesive and adhesive interfacial strength of coated cemented carbide inserts prior to cutting tests...|$|R

30|$|It was {{observed}} that the addition of steel fibers changes the failure mode of UHPC specimens from complete damage or sudden explosion to a somewhat ductile behavior where specimens can remain intact without <b>chipping</b> and <b>spalling</b> (El-Dieb 2009). Various researchers (Reda et al. 1999; Schmidt et al. 2003) reported that the UHPC compressive strength was not influenced {{by the addition of}} high dosages of steel fibers. Increased concentration of steel fibers can create fiber bundling, thus leading to weak spots, which can reduce the efficiency of fibers, hence decreasing compressive strength. A slight increase in compressive strength due to fiber addition can be observed if proper thermal treatment is applied (Soutsos et al. 2005; Jun et al. 2008; Bonneau et al. 1997; Herold and Muller 2004). This mainly depends on the type of fibers and their dosage (Soutsos et al. 2005; Bonneau et al. 1997; Herold and Muller 2004). For example, approximately 30  % increase in compressive strength {{was observed}} with the addition of 2.5  % by mixture volume of steel fibers when specimens were subjected to thermal treatment (Soutsos et al. 2005; Graybeal 2006; Lee and Chisholm 2005; Bonneau et al. 1997). This increase in UHPC compressive strength was attributed to the enhanced tolerance of lateral strains owing to steel fiber addition (Kazemi and Lubell 2012; Hassan et al. 2012; Orgass and Klug 2004; Magureanu et al. 2012; Ye et al. 2012). Furthermore, it was reported that the addition of fibers resulted in less entrapped air, leading to improved density and hence higher compressive strength (Abbas et al. 2015).|$|R

40|$|Abstract Two {{different}} power-scaled noncoherent detection schemes {{are analyzed}} and compared {{in terms of}} detection probability and mean detection time in the uplink of a wideband CDMA system, where the mobile terminal transmits a pilot signal {{in the form of}} <b>bursts</b> of modulated <b>chips,</b> which are transmitted periodically and separated by long silent intervals. Both detection schemes employ temporal noncoherent averaging but differ in the way of spatial processing. One of the schemes, which is well suited for spatially uncorrelated scenarios, employs spatial noncoherent averaging, whereas the other scheme, better suited for scenarios with a distinct spatial structure, employs xed beamforming. The performance analysis is carried out for spatially correlated frequency-selective fading channels taking channel dynamics and initial frequency offsets into account. With the presented analysis it is possible to investigate the effects of spatial correlation on the detection performance and to examine the improvement of using multiple antenna elements at the base station depending on the respective detection scheme.

40|$|Martian surface {{materials}} {{viewed by}} the two Viking landers (VL- 1 and VL- 2) range from fine-grained nearly cohesionless soils to rocks. Footpad 2 of VL- 1, which landed at 2. 30 m/s, penetrated 16. 5 cm into very fine grained dunelike drift material; footpad 3 rests on a rocky soil which it penetrated ≈ 3. 6 cm. Further penetration by footpad 2 may have been arrested by a hard substrate. Penetration by footpad 3 is less than would be expected for a typical lunar regolith. During landing, retroengine exhausts eroded the surface and propelled grains and rocks which produced craters on impact with the surface. Trenches excavated in drift material by the sampler have steep walls with up to 6 cm of relief. Incipient failure of the walls and failures {{at the end of}} the trenches are compatible with a cohesion near 10 – 10 ^ 2 N/m^ 2. Trenching in rocky soil excavated clods and possibly rocks. In two of five samples, commanded sampler extensions were not achieved, a situation indicating that buried rocks or local areas with large cohesions (≥ 10 kN/m^ 2) or both are present. Footpad 2 of VL- 2, which landed at a velocity between 1. 95 and 2. 34 m/s, is partly on a rock, and footpad 3 appears to have struck one; penetration and leg strokes are small. Retroengine exhausts produced more erosion than occurred for VL- 1 owing to increased thrust levels just before touchdown. Deformations of the soil by sampler extensions range from doming of the surface without visible fracturing to doming accompanied by fracturing and the production of angular clods. Although rocks larger than 3. 0 cm are abundant at VL- 1 and VL- 2, repeated attempts to collect rocks 0. 2 – 1. 2 cm across imbedded in soil indicate that rocks in this size range are scarce. There is no evidence that the surface sampler of VL- 2, while it was pushing and nudging rocks ≈ 25 cm across, <b>spalled,</b> <b>chipped,</b> or fractured the rocks. Preliminary analyses of surface sampler motor currents (≈ 25 N force resolution) during normal sampling are consistent with cohesionless frictional soils (ϕ ≈ 36 °) or weakly cohesive frictionless soils (C < 2 kN/m^ 2).
