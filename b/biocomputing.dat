40|$|Background: Small insertions and deletions (indels) have a {{significant}} influence in human disease and, in terms of frequency, they are second only to single nucleotide variants as pathogenic mutations. As the majority of mutations associated with complex traits are located outside the exome, {{it is crucial to}} investigate the potential pathogenic impact of indels in non-coding regions of the human genome. Results: We present FATHMM-indel, an integrative approach to predict the functional effect, pathogenic or neutral, of indels in non-coding regions of the human genome. Our method exploits various genomic annotations in addition to sequence data. When validated on benchmark data, FATHMM-indel significantly outperforms CADD and GAVIN, state of the art models in assessing the pathogenic impact of non-coding variants. FATHMM-indel is available via a web server at indels. <b>biocompute.</b> org. uk. Conclusions: FATHMM-indel can accurately predict the functional impact and prioritise small indels throughout the whole non-coding genome...|$|R
40|$|Ensembl is a {{software}} project to automatically annotate large eukaryotic genomes and release them freely {{into the public}} domain. The project currently automatically annotates 10 complete genomes. This makes very large demands on compute resources, due to the vast number of sequence comparisons {{that need to be}} executed. To circumvent the financial outlay often associated with classical supercomputing environments, farms of multiple, lower-cost machines have now become the norm and have been deployed successfully with this project. The architecture and design of farms containing hundreds of compute nodes is complex and nontrivial to implement. This study will define and explain some of the essential elements to consider when designing such systems. Server architecture and network infrastructure are discussed with a particular emphasis on solutions that worked and those that did not (often with fairly spectacular consequences). The aim of the study is to give the reader, who may be implementing a large-scale <b>biocompute</b> project, an insight into some of the pitfalls that may be waiting ahead...|$|R
40|$|The {{explosion}} of {{data in the}} biological community demands {{the development of more}} scalable and flexible portals for bioinformatic computation. To address this need, we put forth characteristics needed for rigorous, reproducible, and collaborative resources for data intensive science. Implementing a system with these characteristics exposed challenges in user interface, data distribution, and workflow description/execution. We describe several responses to these challenges. The Data-Action-Queue metaphor addresses user interface and system organization concepts. A dynamic data distribution mechanism lays the foundation for the management of persistent datasets. The Makeflow workflow facilitates the simple description and execution of complex multipart jobs. The resulting web portal, <b>Biocompute,</b> has been in production use at the University of Notre Dame’s Bioinformatics Core Facility since the summer of 2009. It has provided over seven years of CPU time through its three sequence search modules — BLAST, SSAHA, and SHRIMP — to ten biological and bioinformatic research groups spanning three universities. In this paper we describe the goals and interface to the system, its architecture and performance, and the insights gained in its development...|$|R
