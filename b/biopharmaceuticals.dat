40|$|<b>Biopharmaceutical</b> supply chains present {{considerable}} complexity {{issue for}} the formulation of optimal plans due to significant uncertainty in the supply chain. The primary goal of <b>biopharmaceutical</b> supply chain planning is to provide reliable supply to patients while coping with various supply chain risks. In chapter 1 first I discuss the key elements and basic characteristics of the <b>biopharmaceutical</b> supply chain. Then I present the major challenges in <b>biopharmaceutical</b> supply chain planning and divide them into two main categories: deterministic complexity problems and stochastic uncertainty problems. In the end of chapter 1 I briefly discuss the most recent work in solving the deterministic complexity problems. The planning of <b>biopharmaceutical</b> supply chain operations faces risks from various sources. These include customer demand fluctuations, regulatory requirement changes, long quality assurance cycle time, etc. In chapter 2, I review the major risks in <b>biopharmaceutical</b> supply chain and current practice to hedge against these risks. The impact of these risks is evaluated {{in terms of a}} cumulative supply and demand perspective. Furthermore I analyze two main risk mitigation tools in supply chain risk management: safety stock and safety time. Then I use simulation to show that safety stock is a preferred approach for risk mitigation in <b>biopharmaceutical</b> supply chains. In chapter 3, first I focus on stochastic lead time risk and discuss conventional as well as crossover based approaches for safety stock planning. Also I demonstrate the benefit of a proposed approach to safety stock planning with numerical examples and simulation. Then the proposed model is extended to consider batch rejection risk and excursion risk. Batch rejection risk represents the possibility that a batch fails to meet regulatory requirements. The excursion risk reflects potential major disruptions in <b>biopharmaceutical</b> supply chain. Examples of such events include contamination of the production facility, earthquake, etc. These three risks cover most of the major uncertainties in <b>biopharmaceutical</b> supply chain. The model determines the necessary safety stock level to prevent stock outs given these risks {{as a function of the}} target service level. In chapter 4, I discuss the implementation of the proposed model in a multi-echelon <b>biopharmaceutical</b> supply chain. Also I use sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of improving key supply chain parameters. Then the model is applied to determine the stock level supplying a regional market of an actual <b>biopharmaceutical</b> supply chain and significant potential savings are demonstrated. In the end I identify a few important potential research problems in <b>biopharmaceutical</b> supply chain management...|$|R

25|$|In 1998, Eli Lilly {{formed a}} joint venture with Icos Corporation (ICOS), a Bothell, Washington-based {{biotechnology}} company, to develop and commercialize Cialis, a product for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. In October 2006, Lilly announced its intention to acquire Icos for $2.1 billion, or $32 per share. After its initial attempt to acquire Icos failed under pressure from large institutional shareholders, Lilly revised its offer to $34 per share. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a proxy advisory firm, advised Icos shareholders to reject the proposal as undervalued, but the buyout was approved by Icos shareholders and Lilly completed its acquisition of the company on January 29, 2007. Lilly closed Icos manufacturing operations, terminated nearly 500 Icos employees, and left 127 employees working at the biologics facility. In December 2007, CMC <b>Biopharmaceuticals</b> A/S (CMC), a Copenhagen, Denmark-based provider of contract biomanufacturing services, bought the Bothell-based biologics facility from Lilly and retained the existing 127 employees.|$|E
25|$|Drug design, often {{referred}} to as rational drug design or simply rational design, is the inventive process of finding new medications based on the knowledge of a biological target. The drug is most commonly an organic small molecule that activates or inhibits the function of a biomolecule such as a protein, which in turn results in a therapeutic benefit to the patient. In the most basic sense, drug design involves the design of molecules that are complementary in shape and charge to the biomolecular target with which they interact and therefore will bind to it. Drug design frequently but not necessarily relies on computer modeling techniques. This type of modeling is sometimes referred to as computer-aided drug design. Finally, drug design that relies on the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the biomolecular target is known as structure-based drug design. In addition to small molecules, <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> and especially therapeutic antibodies are an increasingly important class of drugs and computational methods for improving the affinity, selectivity, and stability of these protein-based therapeutics have also been developed.|$|E
