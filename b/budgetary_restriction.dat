40|$|The {{public budget}} {{has always been}} a much debated object at the {{political}} level as well as in academia. This is not surprising as it mirrors the political intentions and ideologies of those running the government {{on the one hand and}} taking into account that economics is a multiparadigmatic science on the other hand. Against this backcloth, the current unambiguity of <b>budgetary</b> <b>restriction</b> in recent political and scientific debates seems curious. The paper aims at explaining this development and questions its validity by framing a concept of budgetary sustainability on the grounds of a heterodox, post Keynesian model.

The methods which I used are cluster analysis, quintile analysis, regression technique and Granger causality. The results suggest that in Romania there is a negative correlation. A potential cause of the negative effect of defense expenditures on economic growth in Romania is the high proportion of the spending on equipment and other operational spending. Also I have considered the implications of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>restriction</b> – the limited resources might be given priority for other programs. fiscal policy, public expenditures, defense expenditures, economic growth, budget constraint...|$|E

One way to overcome such situation {{is to improve the}} quality of education which, in turn, depends on the correct identification of the investment priorities on the different levels of education, due to government <b>budgetary</b> <b>restriction.</b> Therefore, the present study main goal is to analyze which one is the most important level of education on income generation and economic growth in Paraná State by means of 2005 PNAD micro data and HECKMAN procedure (1979). To accomplish this objective, the returns of different levels of education were estimated and the conclusion is that the undergraduate level is the one that brings the highest return. However, this does not imply that the other educational levels are not crucial in the policy makers’ decision of educational resources allocation.

40|$|Leon Walras (1874) was {{the first}} author who derives the demand {{function}} from an utility func-tion, which should be maximazed under a <b>budgetary</b> <b>restriction.</b> It is only a piece in a complete model of competitive equilibrium model. That is the ‘modern approach’ {{of the theory of}} demand. Alfred Marshall followed suit but avoided to settle the issue as a constrained maximization problem. This way, he provided a more handy and realistic tool for solving the question of the adjustment of compe-titive markets. Marshall built its demand theory based on two assumptions: 1) the individual assigns a different utility function to each good s/he consumes; 2) the marginal utility of money is a constant. That makes it easy to build demand functions because the Marshallian utility functions are not ‘perfect’ represen-tations of the individual preferences, in contrast with that of the modern economic theory. Besides the fact that the Marshallian demand function neither depends on income nor on the prices of the other goods, an important difference remains, which is stressed in this paper: the MDF, in contrast with the Walrasian one, reflects the individual marginal valuation, or societal mar¬ginal valua-tion, if speaking in aggregate terms, of every additional unit of good ‘x’. The ordinary demand func-tion (Walrasian) only gives information about demanded quantities along the whole range of prices, provided that all the units are paid at the same price...|$|E
40|$|The “policy-mix” is a {{relative}} new concept in research-development and innovation literature and policy. It has been introduced some years ago, as {{a new model of}} resources mobilization through the coordination of different policies, having in view the accomplishment of the objective of allotting 3 % of GDP for research and development (R&D) in the European Union countries. This concept refers to R&D (research programs, grant schemes or human resources programs) and non-R&D (legal, fiscal, monetary incentives) “packaged” instruments conducive to increasing investments in research and development activity. Adjusting the R&D agenda to the requirements of integration in European Research Area, Romania adopted during 2005 - 2007, a “package“ of instruments and policies that have had a beneficial effect on the R&D and innovation activities, especially in terms of increasing the public R&D financing. In view of the present context of the big challenges of Lisbon Agenda 2020 and the recent <b>budgetary</b> <b>restriction</b> in Romania, this paper is a pleading for re-setting the “policy-mix” among the priorities of different policies, as a main solution for increasing R&D investment. The analysis of how the different sectoral policies and instruments should interact in order to reach the main objective of the policy mix is another aim of this paper.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, these systems passed from elitism to mass given {{the democratization of}} the access to higher education. Considering the strong {{budgetary}} constraint, higher education institutions are obliged to operate with more efficiency affecting {{the quality of the}} offered service. In this work, we propose a dynamic analysis of the efficiency-quality relationship in higher education with the construction of indicators through non-parametric method, Data Envelopment Analysis, and demonstrate a possible dilemma between these characteristics using Malmquist Index. This technique facilitates the aggregation and weighting of the data used {{in the construction of the}} indicator allowing to respect the higher education characteristics of every country. It uses linear programming tools and defines a best practice frontier that serves as a benchmark for estimating the performance of a given set of units. Performance is represented by the distance to the best practice frontier and weights for partial indicators are endogenously calculated in such a way that the distance is minimized for every unit. For the Quality assessment, we use a variant of DEA model: the radial model without inputs. This approach, traditionally interpreted like a “Helmsman”, is supposed to be able to direct all the partial indicators towards their maximum values. The results show that the countries which severe admission policy are able to manage the quality as well as the quantity of the entrants and, consequently, maintain the quality of the offered service considering the <b>budgetary</b> <b>restriction...</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Centre-Val de Loire is a French Region, where {{green spaces}} {{have a long}} history, linked to its castles: it was {{considered}} as the garden of France. In {{the framework of a}} research program, we chose this Region to study the cultural ecosystem services offered by urban green spaces (UGS). We focused on the six medium cities of the Region to conduct an interdisciplinary study. Our goal was to make municipalities {{aware of the importance of}} their UGS, in a context of <b>budgetary</b> <b>restriction.</b> But between the theory (described by the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment for example) and the practice, several difficulties appear. The first one concerns the interdisciplinary researches; we decided to go beyond this problem by focusing on the same UGS. The second difficulty is about assessment. Different methods are used, especially economic ones or based on models. But our purpose was to identify what UGS provide with city dwellers and the assessment also implies some choices, which can be questioned: criteria, reference, generalization possibilities. Finally, a qualitative study appears more interesting: it reveals more information about the services offered by the different UGS categories and leaves the possibility of considering also disservices, which are often forgotten. One of the relevant results concerns the allotment gardens: they appear to be places of sociability and education, providing services not only for the gardeners. Beyond these gardens, UGS prove complementary. Each one has a function, according to users but also time, especially between weekdays and weekend, and it even concerns the less busy gardens. Organizing each UGS into a hierarchy is difficult, even if we consider the quantitative studies, based on ecological or soil criteria and even economic data (they are not enough). But this hierarchy is finally not necessarily: more than a specific UGS, it is the global supply of UGS, which makes a city more eco-civilized...|$|E
40|$|Neste trabalho caracteriza-se os efeitos dinâmicos dos choques fiscais do governo central sobre a atividade econômica no Brasil, para o período pós-plano Real. Obteve-se resultados para referência e comparação com a {{literatura}} internacional por meio de análise impulso-resposta, a partir de um VAR estrutural com produto, gasto público e impostos líquidos. A suposição padrão na literatura macroeconômica é de que os gastos públicos são exógenos, e talvez também sejam estocásticos. Mas, também está claro que alguns elementos do gasto público são endógenos. Então, propôs-se um VAR estrutural não triangular na forma reduzida dos resíduos, no qual o gasto público é desagregado em consumo e investimento. Foram estimados dois casos de interesse: no primeiro, supôs-se que os choques no investimento neutralizam as discrepâncias entre os choques no consumo e nos impostos líquidos, o equivalente a restrição orçamentária rígida. No outro, assumiu-se que o movimento surpresa nos investimentos reflete todos os tipos de choques nas variáveis fiscais. A identificação é obtida com base nas informações institucionais do orçamento e do sistema tributário, e por intermédio da análise do procedimento operacional das autoridades fiscais. Os resultados alcançados, além de serem robustos em relação à especificação, estão próximos ao relato da literatura empírica para a economia americana e outros países membros OCDE: a resposta do produto aos choques fiscais é pequena e tem característica tipicamente keynesiana. A especificação competitiva, o segundo caso de interesse, mostra que há diferença consistente no padrão temporal das respostas do produto às inovações nas variáveis que compõem a despesa pública. Impulsos nos investimentos têm efeitos duradouros e proporcionalmente mais eficientes em relação ao consumo do governo para elevar o produto. Finalmente, o produto responde de forma positiva à substituição de consumo por investimentos, o que é informação relevante para a política de gastos públicos. _________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTIn {{this research}} paper it is characterized the dynamic {{effects of the}} fiscal shocks {{of the central government}} over the economic activity in Brazil for the post Real Plan period. Results were obtained for reference and comparison with international literature through the Impulse-Response analysis, starting from a structural VAR with product, public spending and net taxes. The standard assumption in the macroeconomic literature is that the public spending are exogenous, and perhaps they are also stochastic. But, {{it is also clear that}} some elements of the public expenses are endogenous. So, it was proposed a not triangular structural VAR in the reduced form of residues, in which the public spending is disaggregated in consumption and investment. Two cases of concern were estimated: in the first one, it was assumed that the shocks in investment neutralize the discrepancies between shocks in the consumption and in the net taxes, the equivalent to a rigid <b>budgetary</b> <b>restriction.</b> In the other one, it was assumed that the unexpected movements in investments reflect all kinds of shocks in the fiscal variables. The identification was obtained based on the institutional information of both budget and tributary systems, and through the analysis of the operational procedure of the fiscal authorities. The results obtained, besides being robust regarding the specification, are close to the account of the empiric literature for the American economy and other OCDE country members: the response of the product to the fiscal shocks is small and has characteristic typically Keynesian. The competitive specification, the second case of concern, shows that there is a consistent difference in the temporal standard of the product responses to the innovations in the variables that compose the public expense. Impulses in investments, if compared to the government’s consumption, have longer-lasting and proportionally more efficient effects in the raise of the product. Finally, the product responds in a positive way to the substitution from consumption to investments, what is relevant information for the public expense policy...|$|E
