5000|$|Ghostwriters {{will often}} spend from {{several months to}} a full year researching, writing, and editing nonfiction and fiction works for a client, and they are paid based on a price per hour, per word or per page, with a flat fee, or a {{percentage}} of the royalties of the sales, or some combination thereof. Some ghostwriters charge for articles [...] "$4 per word and more depending on the complexity" [...] of the article. Literary agent Madeleine Morel states that the average ghostwriter's advance for work for major book publishers is [...] "between $40,000 and $70,000".

5000|$|In 1953 the Lloyd LP400 (saloon/sedan) {{came with}} a manufacturer's {{recommended}} price of DM 3,780, while the Kombi was priced at DM 3,970. By September 1955, supported by that year's healthy sales volumes, and presumably in response to pressure from the market, {{the price of the}} LP400 was down to DM3,350, and the Kombi was offered at DM 3,480. However, the West German small car market in West Germany was increasingly dominated by Volkswagen. In March 1954 the price of a standard Volkswagen was reduced from DM 4,150 to DM 3,950. Apart from a handful of exotic looking (and exotically priced) vehicles, the passenger cars produced by Volkswagen were all the same shape. The shape had been innovative twenty years earlier, but the architecture and look of the car had changed very little since. The approach of the Borgward Group could hardly have been more different. In 1955 the group produced 91,810 passenger cars, using three different brands and offering a wider range of models than any other West German manufacturer, with models replaced or substantially upgraded every few years. One result of these contrasting approaches was that it was Volkswagen that set the prices in what was still an acutely price sensitive market segment. In August 1955 the price of a standard Volkswagen came down again, to DM 3,790, a level that it held till 1961. [...] In order to maintain market share competitors had little option other than leaving Volkswagen to set the <b>benchmark</b> <b>prices</b> on the domestic market.|$|E

40|$|We {{simulate}} competitive benchmark {{wholesale prices}} for electricity in California {{during the summer}} of 2000, taking account of changes in gas prices, demand, and imports during this time period. We also examine the impact of changes in the prices of NOx emissions permits on the competitive <b>benchmark</b> <b>prices</b> for electricity. The competitive <b>benchmark</b> <b>prices</b> are compared to actual prices. A significant fraction of the changes in wholesale electricity prices in California during Summer 2000 can be explained by these four factors. The impact of higher NOx permit prices, and their interaction with reduced imports into California, have a particularly large impact on competitive <b>benchmark</b> <b>prices.</b> However, during June, July and August a large unexplained difference between actual prices and competitive <b>benchmark</b> <b>prices</b> remains. We attribute this difference to supplier market power and related market imperfections. We then examine whether there is evidence of strategic behavior by suppliers during the highest priced hours during the summer.

40|$|Abstracts: In {{this paper}} we point out various factors {{which should be}} taken into {{consideration}} when assessing market power in the evolving electricity markets. Of particular interest are the effects of the electricity market design rules, type of software employed when computing electricity clearing price, and the generation technology-specific costs, such as start up and shut down costs. In this paper we propose a method of estimating a <b>benchmark</b> <b>price</b> which accounts for these factors unique to electricity markets; when assessing market power the actual price is compared to this <b>benchmark</b> <b>price.</b> The pros and cons of assessing market power using such aggregate <b>benchmark</b> <b>price</b> and/or more direct analysis of individual bids are illustrated using the New England market data...|$|R

40|$|During the Summer of 2000, {{wholesale}} {{electricity prices}} in California were nearly 500 % {{higher than they}} were during the same months in 1998 or 1999. This price explosion was unexpected and has called into question whether electricity restructuring will bring the benefits of competition promised to consumers. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine the factors that explain this increase in wholesale electricity prices. We simulate competitive <b>benchmark</b> <b>prices</b> for Summer of 2000 taking account of all relevant supply and demand factors [...] - gas prices, demand, imports from other states, and emission permit prices. We then compare the simulated competitive <b>benchmark</b> <b>prices</b> with the actual prices observed. We find that there is a large gap between our benchmark competitive prices and observed prices, suggesting that the prices observed during summer 2000 reflect, in part, the exercise of market power by suppliers. We then proceed to examine supplier behavior during high-price hours. We find evidence that suppliers withheld supply from the market that would have been profitable for price-taking firms to sell at the market price. electricity, market power, deregulation...|$|E
40|$|Marketing {{literature}} has long recognized that brand price elasticity {{need not be}} monotonic and symmetric, but has yet to provide generalizable market-level insights on threshold-based price elasticity, asymmetric thresholds, and the sign and magnitude of elasticity transitions. This paper introduces smooth transition regression models to study threshold-based price elasticity of the top 4 brands across 20 fast-moving consumer good categories. Threshold-based price elasticity is found for 76 % of all brands: 29 % reflect historical <b>benchmark</b> <b>prices,</b> 16 % reflect competitive <b>benchmark</b> <b>prices,</b> and 31 % reflect both types of benchmarks. The authors demonstrate asymmetry for gains versus losses on three levels: the threshold size and the sign and {{the magnitude of the}} elasticity difference. Interestingly, they observe latitude of acceptance for gains compared to the historical benchmark, but saturation effects in most other cases. Moreover, category characteristics influence the extent and the nature of threshold-based price elasticity, while individual brand characteristics impact the size of the price thresholds. From a managerial perspective, the paper illustrates the sales, revenue, and margin implications for price changes typically observed in consumer markets. kinked demand curve, smooth-transition regression models, time-series analysis, asymmetric price thresholds, empirical generalizations...|$|E

5000|$|Actually, Verstein argues, {{this data}} {{strongly}} supported a different theory of manipulation. The majors bought up potential hot oil {{that was being}} priced below the market—oil that if included in calculating the benchmark (for example, if bought up {{by one of the}} jobber middlemen whose purchases were included in the benchmark) would have lowered the benchmark and thus lowered the prices the majors received for all of their oil. But the prices that the majors paid for the potential hot oil did not go into the <b>benchmark,</b> and the <b>prices</b> the jobbers would have paid did not go into the benchmark (because the jobbers never bought that oil). [...] "By buying up any oil priced more cheaply than the current <b>benchmark</b> <b>price,</b> the oil companies could support the <b>benchmark</b> <b>price</b> against falling with the market." [...] Since 91% of the potential hot oil that the majors bought was bought below the <b>benchmark</b> <b>price,</b> and the majors disqualified that oil from inclusion in the benchmark by buying it themselves, the dancing-partner program prevented a huge drop in the spot market benchmark. Apparently, the government failed to realize this.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the marketing performance of wheat farmers in Illinois and Kansas over 1982 - 2004. The results show that farmer <b>benchmark</b> <b>prices</b> for wheat in Illinois and Kansas fall in the middle-third of the price range about half to three-quarters of the time. Consistent with previous studies, this refutes the contention that Illinois and Kansas wheat farmers routinely market the bulk of their wheat crop in the bottom portion of the price range. Tests of the average difference between farmer and market <b>benchmark</b> <b>prices</b> are sensitive to the market benchmark considered. Marketing performance of wheat farmers in Illinois and Kansas is about equal to the market if 24 - or 20 -month market benchmarks are used, is slightly above the market if a 12 -month price benchmark is used, and is significantly less than the market if the harvest benchmark is used. The sensitivity of marketing performance to the market benchmark considered is explained by the seasonal pattern of prices. While Illinois producers performed slightly better than their counterparts in Kansas, notable differences in performance across these two geographic areas is not observed. benchmarks, Illinois, Kansas, marketing, performance, price, wheat, Agricultural Finance,...|$|E
