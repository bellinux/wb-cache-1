50|$|The 19th century {{saw this}} {{revolution}} in beekeeping practice completed through {{the perfection of}} the movable comb hive by the American Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth. Langstroth {{was the first person}} to make practical use of Huber's earlier discovery that there was a specific spatial measurement between the wax combs, later called the <b>bee</b> <b>space,</b> which bees do not block with wax, but keep as a free passage. Having determined this <b>bee</b> <b>space</b> (between 5 and 8 mm, or 1/4 to 3/8"), Langstroth then designed a series of wooden frames within a rectangular hive box, carefully maintaining the correct space between successive frames, and found that the bees would build parallel honeycombs in the box without bonding them to each other or to the hive walls. This enables the beekeeper to slide any frame out of the hive for inspection, without harming the bees or the comb, protecting the eggs, larvae and pupae contained within the cells. It also meant that combs containing honey could be gently removed and the honey extracted without destroying the comb. The emptied honey combs could then be returned to the bees intact for refilling. Langstroth's book, The Hive and Honey-bee, published in 1853, described his rediscovery of the <b>bee</b> <b>space</b> and the development of his patent movable comb hive.|$|E

Langstroth, which featured a movable frame around the <b>bee</b> <b>space.</b> His version {{was known as the}} 'Woodbury Hive' and was marketed on his behalf by George Neighbour & Sons, the London specialists in beekeeping supplies.

5000|$|Langstroth hives {{make use}} of <b>bee</b> <b>space</b> so that frames are neither glued {{together}} nor filled with burr comb: comb joining adjacent frames. They use standardized sizes of hive bodies (rectangular boxes without tops or bottoms placed {{one on top of}} another) and internal frames to ensure that parts are interchangeable and that the frames will remain relatively easy to remove, inspect, and replace without killing the bees. Langstroth hive bodies are rectangular in shape and can be made from a variety of materials that can be stacked to expand the usable space for the bees. Inside the boxes, frames are hung parallel to each other. The minimum size of the hive is dependent on outside air temperature and potential food sources in the winter months. The colder the winter, the larger the hive and food stores need to be. In regions with severe winter weather, a basketball-shaped cluster of bees typically survives in a [...] "double-deep" [...] box. In temperate and equatorial regions, a winter cluster will survive in a single box or in a [...] "nuc" [...] (short for nucleus colony).Langstroth frames are thin rectangular structures made of wood or plastic and typically have a wax or plastic foundation on which the bees draw out the comb. The frames hold the beeswax honeycomb formed by the bees. Ten frames side by side will fill the hive body and leave the right amount of <b>bee</b> <b>space</b> between each frame and between the end frames and the hive body.|$|E
50|$|In 1814, Petro Prokopovych, {{the founder}} of {{commercial}} beekeeping in Ukraine, invented {{one of the very}} first beehive frames. However, for easy operations in beehives the spaces between elements need to be correct. The correct distance between combs was described in 1845 by Jan Dzierżon as 1½ inches from the center of one top bar {{to the center of the}} next one. In 1848 Dzierzon introduced grooves into the hive's side walls replacing the strips of wood for moving top bars. The grooves were 8 x 8 mm, the spacing later termed <b>bee</b> <b>space.</b> The Langstroth hive was the first successful top-opened hive with movable frames. Langstroth hive was however a direct descendant of Dzierzon's hive designs.|$|E

Frequency and density of Varroa mites in the capped drone cells were higher {{than those in the}} capped worker cells. Density of mites in the worker cells was significant positive correlated with those on adult bees (r= 0. 75). The second egg laid by the parental female were male in worker cells or drone cells, while the rest of eggs in the other egg laying sequence were females. The female to male sex ratio of progeny was 11 : 4. Developmental periods of the female and the male were studied from mites living in the capped worker and drone cells. Frequency of Varroa mites parasitized on abdominal sternum was higher than those on other portions of adult bees. The chances of mites occurring on the combs of the bee colonies to the queen egg-laying pattern was positive correlated. In other words, among all measured areas, the highest chances of mites occured in the brood cells was in the central and the lower portion of the comb. Frequency distribution of mites among <b>bee</b> <b>spaces</b> showed no different significance, however, a higher frequence distribution measurement of mites was observed at the central portion of <b>bee</b> <b>spaces.</b> Mites reared with three different artificial rearing cells indicated a higher successful rate of development of progeny in centrifugal rearing cells with drone brood.

50|$|Honey bees use caves, rock {{cavities}} {{and hollow}} trees as natural nesting sites. In warmer climates they may occasionally build exposed hanging nests as pictured. Members of other subgenera have exposed aerial combs. The nest {{is composed of}} multiple honeycombs, parallel to each other, with a relatively uniform <b>bee</b> <b>space.</b> It usually has a single entrance. Western honey bees prefer nest cavities approximately 45 litres in volume and avoid those smaller than 10 or larger than 100 litres. Western honey bees show several nest-site preferences: the height above ground is usually between 1 m and 5 m, entrance positions tend to face downward, Equatorial-facing entrances are favored, and nest sites over 300 m from the parent colony are preferred. Bees usually occupy nests for several years.|$|E
50|$|Langstroth {{revolutionized}} the beekeeping industry by using <b>bee</b> <b>space</b> in his top-opening hive. In {{the summer of}} 1851 he found that, by leaving an even, approximately bee-sized space between {{the top of the}} frames holding the honeycomb and the flat coverboard above, he was able quite easily to remove the coverboard, which was normally well cemented to the frames with propolis, making separation hard to achieve. He later used this discovery to make the frames themselves easily removable. If a small space was left (less than 1/4 inch or 6.4 mm) the bees filled it with propolis; on the other hand, when a larger space was left (more than 3/8 inch or 9.5 mm) the bees filled it with comb.|$|E
50|$|A. nigrocincta is a {{medium-sized}} cavity-nesting species. Colonies are “permanent” and new colonies are formed by fission. Multiple combs {{are found in}} dark cavities such as hollows of trunks of live or dead trees, underneath roofs, water jars, and caves. Combs are also built with multiple attachment sites so that {{the contents of the}} nest are spread out over several points of contact. These nesting sites are close to the ground, usually 4-5 m in distance. Multiple combs are built in a pattern {{in which there is a}} uniform distance, known as the <b>bee</b> <b>space,</b> between each comb. There are two types of combs in a brood: smaller ones for workers and larger ones for drones, with worker cells averaging around 4.5 mm. Queen cells can be found on the lower edges of the combs, while honey is stored in the upper as well as the outer part of the combs.|$|E

5000|$|In its {{original}} form, the National hive provides ⅜" [...] (9mm) bottom beespace—that is, the top {{surface of the}} frame bar is flush with {{the top of the}} box, and the lower surface of the frame is one <b>bee</b> <b>space</b> above the bottom of the box. Thus, when two boxes are stacked atop one another, there is exactly one beespace vertically between the frames. However, both top and bottom beespace designs may now be found in use.The roof shown in the MAFF leaflet is a telescoping cover, with internal dimensions of 18¾" [...] (476mm), meaning a relatively loose fit over the topmost box. The total height of the roof is (depending on timber thickness) around 6¼" [...] (160mm), though a 4" [...] roof is now also common.

50|$|In the United States, the Langstroth hive is {{commonly}} used. The Langstroth {{was the first}} successful top-opened hive with movable frames. Many other hive designs {{are based on the}} principle of <b>bee</b> <b>space</b> first described by Langstroth. The Langstroth hive is a descendant of Jan Dzierzon’s Polish hive designs. In the United Kingdom, {{the most common type of}} hive is the British National, which can hold Hoffman, British Standard or Manley frames. It is not unusual to see some other sorts of hive (Smith, Commercial, WBC, Langstroth, and Rose). Dadant and Modified Dadant hives are widely used in France and Italy where their large size is an advantage. Square Dadant hives - often called 12 frame Dadant or Brother Adam hives - are used in large parts of Germany and other parts of Europe by commercial beekeepers. The Rose hive is a modern design that attempts to address many of the flaws and limitations of other movable frame hives. The only significant weakness of the Rose design is that it requires 2 or 3 boxes as a brood nest which infers a large number of frames to be worked when managing the bees. The major advantage shared by these designs is that additional brood and honey storage space can be added via boxes of frames added to the hive. This also simplifies honey collection since an entire box of honey can be removed instead of removing one frame at a time.|$|E
40|$|Constructing top-bar hives Cue: Since the 1960 s, {{there have}} been many {{attempts}} to introduce new styles of beehive in Africa. The most successful example is the ?top-bar? hive. With this kind of hive, horizontal bars, usually made of wood, are placed along the top of a wooden box. The bars must be a certain width, so that the distance between each bar {{is the same as the}} distance between combs found in a bees nest. This distance is called the ?<b>bee</b> <b>space?.</b> Bees are encouraged to build their combs along these bars, and down, filling the box. This allows beekeepers to remove each bar and comb individually, to check it and to harvest the honey. In Malawi, the Community Partnerships for Sustainable Resource Management project, also known as COMPASS, has introduced top-bar hive technology to rural communities, and provided training in how to make and use the hives. Patrick Mphaka visited the project to find out more. IN:		?Malawi has since 2005 witnessed ?? OUT:		??related to the beehive construction. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 09 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Nobel Moyo of the Community Partnerships for Sustainable Resource Management project in Malawi. And for more information on constructing top-bar hives, contact the Compass office, on + 265 622 800. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mphaka	Malawi has since 2005 witnessed a sustained campaign for an expansion of beekeeping through radio, television, newspapers, and actual trainings in various parts of the country. True to those campaigns, beekeeping is growing, as evidenced by the increased production of 200 tonnes in 2006 from a mere 60 tonnes in 2004. One of the most important factors in this increased productivity has been the introduction of the new type of beehive called the Malawi Standard Hive. This hive has standard parts and measurements. Mr. Nobel Moyo is Training Specialist working for the USAID funded project, COMPASS, which has been in the forefront of promoting beekeeping in Malawi. He explains in this interview that abiding by the measurements when constructing a Malawi Standard Hive has its advantages. Moyo	This Malawi Standard Hive measures 105 cm in length and 45 cm in width, and 30 cm in depth and 20 cm at the bottom. On top you are supposed to put what they call the top-bars, that is why sometimes it is called a top-bar hive. These top-bars are supposed to be 3. 3 cm in width and 50 cm in length, and they are supposed to be 2. 5 cm again in thickness. And for each Malawi Standard Hive, you can have 30 to 31 top-bars. Those are the ones that will be used for building their combs. Mphaka	I am sure that these measurements did not just come, they were decided upon maybe in relation to the engineering of the bees when they are coming up with their combs. In such a beehive, would we know how much honey in a fruitful year one would harvest? Moyo	As we said, bees will be building their combs on those top-bars, and each standard hive is supposed to have 30 to 31 top-bars. Out of that, in a well managed beehive, you expect that 25 of the 30 top-bars would have well built combs filled with honey, whilst the remaining 5 combs would be left with brood. So a mature built comb filled with honey is supposed to weigh 2. 5 kilograms of honey. So, if you have a well managed beehive, you are expected to get about 45 to 50 kgs of honey. Mphaka	I understand Mr. Moyo that adhering to these measurements is also very important in the general management of the industry itself, because sometimes you transfer these top-bars from one beehive to another. Moyo	Yes, in fact the Malawi Standard Hives are advantageous because they can assist you in managing your bees or managing your hive. With the top-bars, you can easily check the status of the honey in the beehive. You can actually knock on top of the top-bars. The sound that you get from there could determine whether the honey is mature or not. The Malawi Standard Hive through the top-bars can also assist you in transferring bees from one beehive to another beehive. This system is advantageous because if the beehive is overpopulated, you can manage to transfer the bees from one beehive to another, or if you want to colonize a new beehive, you can transfer some bees from one beehive to another. And this can only be possible through the Malawi Standard Hive because you can use some combs attached to those top-bars and transfer them to a totally new beehive. So that is another advantage and this can not be done in other hives like the local hives where you can not separate the bees from one hive to the next. Mphaka	So when you have made that transfer it means that you take the other top-bars from the other empty beehive and bring them in here? Moyo	Yes. So you are exchanging. Mphaka	Thank you very much Mr. Moyo. I hope the information is going to help those who are about to start beekeeping themselves. Moyo	Thank you very much. For more details for those people who might be interested, then they can get in touch with COMPASS, or they can get a beekeeper?s handbook which has been developed by COMPASS. There are all those specifications and drawings indicated in the beekeeper?s handbook related to the beehive construction. End of track.
