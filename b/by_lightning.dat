5|$|An off-duty Northwest Airlines {{pilot who}} {{observed}} the crash told newspapers {{that he believed}} that the airliner had been struck <b>by</b> <b>lightning.</b> Some local farmers said that the plane seemed to barrel roll, but also observed that while rainfall was significant, winds were relatively light.|$|E

40|$|Our {{goal is to}} {{find out}} {{possible}} appearance of rotational motion in the atmosphere, created <b>by</b> a <b>lightning.</b> A positive solution of this question, in the end, leads to a necessity of accepting that processes of birth and annihilation of electron-positron pairs take place in the leader head of lightning channel. Under this condition, within the framework of our physical model of development of a lightning, we suggest a logical explanation of the stepwise structure of a negative leader, intensive radio emission produced <b>by</b> <b>lightnings,</b> gamma-ray flashes from thunderstorm and anomalously intensive electric currents from positive leaders. As for the development of intensive tornado it is determined by pumping of the angular moment produced <b>by</b> <b>lightnings</b> in a local area of the thunderstorm.

40|$|The Protected Areas in Brazil {{have been}} injured by {{wildfires}} that treathen the high biodiversity and ecological processes. The Serra da Canastra National Park (SCNP), located at south Minas Gerais State, is characterized by grasslands predominance and an ancient incorrect use of fire as a land management tool, wich cause large wildfires. The objective of this work was to analyse fire ocorrences in SCNP and to give data to reduce large wildfires as a biodiversity conservation question. The data collection was carried out with fire reports from 1987 to 2001 and local visits. The results shown that most of forest fires causes (50 %) in SCNP are human originated, in spite of several forest fires caused <b>by</b> <b>lightnings</b> (44 %). Among human causes the most is originated by lawbreakers (47 %). There is {{a high number of}} forest fires caused <b>by</b> <b>lightnings</b> during the rainy season and transition dry-rainy season and a high number of forest fires caused by humans during the dry season. However, the forest fires caused <b>by</b> <b>lightnings</b> are often restricted to small areas (lower than 500 ha) and the forest fires caused by humans reached large areas in SCNP. Furthermore, the control of fire in SCNP should include several prevention activities, mainly environmental education and combustible isolation...|$|R

University of Florida lightning expert Martin A. Uman has calculated that the average resident is within a half-mile of 10 to 15 lightning strikes every year.

Elsewhere, two individuals died of heart attacks: one while installing storm shutters on his home, and another at a designated shelter.|$|E

In 1699, Jacobus Van Cortlandt dammed Tibbetts Brook to power a sawmill, creating a mill pond at the site where the lake is. Later, he also added a gristmill.

5|$|By 1910, {{the canal}} running through Rosendale had closed. On July5, 1911, the Jacob Rutsen house was hit <b>by</b> <b>lightning</b> and {{destroyed}} in a severe storm.

In April 1923, the Rosendale railroad depot and its freight house were destroyed in a fire.|$|E
