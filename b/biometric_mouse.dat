40|$|Abstract-Behavior-based user {{authentication}} with pointing devices, such as mice or touchpads, {{has been gaining}} attention. As an emerging behavioral <b>biometric,</b> <b>mouse</b> dynamics aims to address the authentication problem by verifying computer users {{on the basis of}} their mouse operating styles. This process represents a simple and efficient {{user authentication}} approach based on a fixed mouse-operation task. For each sample of the mouse-operation task, both traditional holistic features and newly-defined procedural features are extracted for accurate and fine-grained characterization of a user’s unique mouse behavior. Distance-measurement and eigenspace-transformation techniques are applied to obtain feature components for efficiently representing the original mouse feature space. Then a one-class learning algorithm is employed in the distance-based feature eigen space for the authentication task.

40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of this paper is to present a new {{e-learning}} model based on web applications with attendance control ability. The presented multimodal biometric based model is used to identification, authentication and tracking the users. In this model two behavioral <b>biometric</b> characteristics (<b>mouse</b> movements and keystroke dynamics) and a physical one (face features) are used. A new algorithm is presented to demonstrate use of these three biometrics technologies. As the experiments’ results show, in verification and attendance control processes the proposed solution needs a lower level of students’ collaboration. After the implementation of this model it can be added to the existing LMS and become compatible with it. Therefore, this model can be used to track the continuous attendance of the users in sensitive stages of e-learning process...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the further {{development}} and testing of an existing <b>Mouse</b> Movement <b>Biometric</b> Identification system. Building on the research and work from a previous implementation of a <b>mouse</b> <b>biometric</b> system, the study focuses on enhancing the data capture program to enrich the data with more features to identify the user, collecting more samples of data, normalization of the data into the required format and comparing the results to previous conclusions. A total of 205 data files were collected from users to further develop and test the software. All features of the Mouse Movement system are discussed as well as final recommendations for future research and improvement has been included...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonographic {{assessment}} of fetal growth to estimate fetal weight {{has been widely}} used in clinical obstetrics but not in laboratory mice. Even though {{it is important to}} assess fetal growth abnormalities for gene-targeting studies using mice, there have been no reports of accurately estimated fetal weight using fetal <b>biometric</b> parameters in <b>mice.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} establish an accurate mouse formula using fetal biometric parameters under ultrasound imaging. Using a high-frequency ultrasound system with a 40 MHz transducer, we measured 293 fetuses of biparietal diameter and mean abdominal diameter from day 12. 5 postcoitus (p. c.) until day 18. 5 p. c every day. Thirteen algorithms for humans based on head and/or abdominal measurements were assessed. We established an accurate formula based on measurement of the abdomen in Jcl:ICR mice to investigate gestational complications, such as intrauterine growth restriction...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{graphical}} {{authentication system}} is presented {{which is based}} on a matching scheme. The user is required to match up thumbnail graphical images that belong to a variety of categories – in an order based approach. The number of images in the selection panel was varied to determine how this effects memorability. In addition, timing information was included as a means of enhancing the security level of the system. That is, the user’s mouse clicks were timed and used as part of the authentication process. This {{is one of the few}} studies that employ a proper <b>biometric</b> facility, namely <b>mouse</b> dynamics, into a graphical authentication system. Lastly, this study employees the use of the 2 -D version of Fitts’ law, the Accot-Zhai streering law, which is used to examine the effect of image size on usability. The results from this study indicate that the combination of biometrics (mouse timing information) into a graphical authentication scheme produces FAR/FRR values that approach textual based authentication schemes...|$|R

To investigate the potential role of skeletal muscle AMPKa 2 activation in the metabolic phenotype of UCP 1 -TG mice we generated double transgenic (DTG) mice, by crossing of UCP 1 -TG mice with DN-AMPKa 2 mice overexpressing a dominant negative a 2 subunit of AMPK in SM {{which resulted in}} an impaired AMPKa 2 activity by 9069 % in SM of DTG <b>mice.</b> <b>Biometric</b> analysis of young male mice showed decreased body weight, lean and fat mass for both UCP 1 -TG and DTG compared to WT and DN-AMPKa 2 mice. Energy intake and weight-specific total energy expenditure were increased, both in UCP 1 -TG and DTG mice. Moreover, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and fatty acid oxidation were not altered in DTG compared to UCP 1 -TG. Also uncoupling induced induction and secretion of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF 21) from SM was preserved in DTG mice. However, voluntary physical cage activity as well as ad libitum running wheel access during night uncovered a severe activity intolerance of DTG mice. Histological analysis showed a progressive degenerative morphology in SM of DTG mice which was not observed in SM of UCP 1 -TG mice. Moreover, ATP-depletion related cellular stress response via heat shock protein 70 was highly induced, whereas capillarization regulator VEGF was suppressed in DTG muscle. In addition, AMPKa 2 -mediated induction of mitophagy regulator ULK 1 was suppressed in DTG mice, as well as mitochondrial respiratory capacit...|$|R
