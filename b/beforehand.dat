5|$|TNA {{released}} a poster promoting the event featuring A.J. Styles, Chris Harris, Christopher Daniels, and Jeff Jarrett {{at some point}} <b>beforehand.</b>|$|E
5|$|From {{literary}} sources it {{is known}} that the collapsible umbrella was invented during Wang Mang's reign, although the simple parasol existed <b>beforehand.</b> This employed sliding levers and bendable joints that could be protracted and retracted.|$|E
5|$|Mikijirō Hira as Sir Doi Toshitsura, {{the senior}} {{advisor to the}} Shogunate Council. Alarmed that Naritsugu has been {{considered}} by the Shogun for a political position on the council, he hires Shinzaemon to kill Naritsugu <b>beforehand.</b>|$|E
5|$|No {{preparation}} is normally necessary for this examination, {{but if a}} complementary study of abdominal veins is also required, the patient {{will be asked to}} fast for 12 hours <b>beforehand.</b> The sensitivity and specificity measurements are around 90%.|$|E
5|$|The Israelis {{expected}} a forty-eight-hour warning <b>beforehand</b> from their intelligence services. At any rate, they were confident that any Arab attack would be swiftly decimated by the IAF.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{habits of}} estuary-dwelling pufferfish have been little researched in general. Fieldwork in the Hawkesbury River and tributaries north of Sydney {{found that the}} smooth toadfish breeds between April and July, building up fat stores in its liver from February to April <b>beforehand.</b>|$|E
5|$|Winners of PGA Tour regular-season and playoff {{events that}} award {{at least a}} full-point {{allocation}} for the FedEx Cup, starting with the RBC Heritage the week after the Masters to the Shell Houston Open the week <b>beforehand.</b>|$|E
5|$|As well {{as these}} molecules, {{emission}} from heavy atoms such as iron, magnesium and silicon was detected, with abundances {{consistent with what}} would {{be found in a}} cometary nucleus. Although a substantial amount of water was detected spectroscopically, it was not as much as predicted <b>beforehand,</b> meaning that either the water layer thought to exist below the clouds was thinner than predicted, or that the cometary fragments did not penetrate deeply enough.|$|E
5|$|Both teams progressed {{through four}} {{elimination}} rounds {{to reach the}} final. The match was Alloa Athletic's first national cup final in its 121-year history whilst it was Inverness Caledonian Thistle's first since the club was founded five years <b>beforehand</b> in 1994. The tournament was contested by clubs below the Scottish Premier League; Inverness Caledonian Thistle from the First Division and Alloa Athletic from the Second Division.|$|E
5|$|Guitar is a 1986 solo studio album by American jazz guitarist Sonny Sharrock. He {{recorded}} the album with producer Bill Laswell at RPM Sound Studios in New York City. As the project's sole instrumentalist, Sharrock performed and overdubbed his guitar improvisations onto other sections {{of a song}} he had recorded <b>beforehand.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2005, after a {{match between}} Glentoran and rival team Linfield, Linfield fans broke down a gate in The Oval {{to access the}} pitch and throw objects at Glentoran fans in the main stand after both sets of fans had been {{throwing}} missiles at each other <b>beforehand.</b> Two people were charged with rioting.|$|E
5|$|In {{countries}} of the former Soviet Union and other eastern European countries, a team {{has in the past}} been chosen several years <b>beforehand,</b> and they are given special training specifically for the event. However, such methods have been discontinued in some countries. In Ukraine, for instance, selection tests consist of four olympiads comparable to the IMO by difficulty and schedule. While identifying the winners, only the results of the current selection olympiads are considered.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that between 1,000 and 2,000 people actually attended the match; Manchester United and Derby County had played immediately <b>beforehand,</b> and some spectators for that match had stayed on to watch the Stockport match for free. However, only 13 people paid at the gate to watch the Stockport match by itself.|$|E
5|$|It is {{unlikely}} that Aubame participated in the planning of the 1964 Gabon coup d'état. It appears that he joined the effort after being recruited by the new government. His nephew, Pierre Eyeguet, a former ambassador to the United Kingdom, may have known of the plot <b>beforehand</b> and notified his uncle, although it is unknown whether or not Aubame established contact with the plotters.|$|E
5|$|Members {{who wish}} to ask general or themed {{questions}}, or questions of the First Minister, must lodge them with parliamentary clerks <b>beforehand</b> and selections are made by the Presiding Officer. Written questions may also be submitted by members to ministers. Written questions and answers are published in the Official Report.|$|E
5|$|News of Danielle's {{death was}} subject to a media embargo, {{although}} several newspapers and magazines including the Radio Times leaked news of Crace's exit {{in advance of the}} event. Digital Spy's Kris Green reported that most of the online EastEnders community had anticipated the character's exit from the soap <b>beforehand,</b> some as early as January 2009.|$|E
5|$|No manager has won {{a league}} title with the club, however, Billy Lamont managed East Stirlingshire to {{promotion}} to the 1980–81 Scottish First Division after finishing runners-up in Division Two, one point behind rivals Falkirk. He also took East Stirlingshire to the quarter-finals of the Scottish Cup, the furthest stage of the tournament the club has reached since reaching the same stage 91 years <b>beforehand</b> in 1889–90.|$|E
5|$|Periodically, {{the release}} team publishes {{guidelines}} to the developers {{in order to}} ready the release. A new release occurs after a freeze, when all important software is reasonably up-to-date in the Testing branch and any other significant issues are solved. At that time, all packages in the testing branch become the new stable branch. Although freeze dates are time-based, release dates are not, which are announced by the release managers {{a couple of weeks}} <b>beforehand.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since {{the second}} World Cup in 1934, {{qualifying}} tournaments {{have been held}} to thin {{the field for the}} final tournament. They are held within the six FIFA continental zones (Africa, Asia, North and Central America and Caribbean, South America, Oceania, and Europe), overseen by their respective confederations. For each tournament, FIFA decides the number of places awarded to each of the continental zones <b>beforehand,</b> generally based on the relative strength of the confederations' teams.|$|E
5|$|Star Trek: Discovery is {{a direct}} prequel to , set roughly ten years <b>beforehand.</b> It premiered September 24, 2017 in the United States and Canada on CBS before moving to CBS All Access, while Netflix streams the show outside the United States and is also {{providing}} most of the show's funding.|$|E
5|$|The Lisbon Treaty {{finally came}} into force on 1 December 2009, {{granting}} Parliament powers {{over the entire}} EU budget, making Parliament's legislative powers equal to the Council's in nearly all areas and linking the appointment of the Commission President to Parliament's own elections. Despite some calls for the parties to put forward candidates <b>beforehand,</b> only the EPP (which had re-secured their position as largest party) had one in re-endorsing Barroso.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{team found}} that the Nintendo DS was best suited to the game's development. The team planned to bring the game to PlayStation 3 {{from the beginning of}} development, but opted to work on the DS version of the game <b>beforehand</b> due to the larger number of DS users in Japan at the time.|$|E
5|$|The new Contract Sejm, {{named for}} the {{agreement}} that had been reached by the communist party and the Solidarity movement during the Polish Round Table Talks, would be dominated by Solidarity. As agreed <b>beforehand,</b> Wojciech Jaruzelski was elected president. However, the communist candidate for Prime Minister, Czesław Kiszczak, who replaced Mieczysław Rakowski, failed to gain enough support to form a government.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} used to fix {{the conversion}} rate between the Greek drachma and the euro was different, since the euro by then was already two years old. While the conversion rates for the initial eleven currencies were determined only hours before the euro was introduced, the conversion rate for the Greek drachma was fixed several months <b>beforehand.</b>|$|E
5|$|The result meant Montoya {{moved up}} into fifth {{place in the}} Drivers' Championship, 83 points behind leader Michael Schumacher who {{clinched}} the title two races <b>beforehand.</b> Barrichello's third position finish allowed him {{to close the gap}} to David Coulthard. Williams' strong finish meant the gap between themselves and McLaren was reduced to eight points with two races remaining in the season.|$|E
5|$|A popular {{approach}} {{to improve performance}} {{is to create a}} memory pool-based allocator. Instead of allocating memory every time an item is inserted or removed from a container, a large block of memory (the memory pool) is allocated <b>beforehand,</b> possibly at the startup of the program. The custom allocator will serve individual allocation requests by simply returning a pointer to memory from the pool. Actual deallocation of memory can be deferred until the lifetime of the memory pool ends. An example of memory pool-based allocators {{can be found in the}} Boost C++ Libraries.|$|E
5|$|After Belushi's wife Judy and Aykroyd had a {{talk with}} Belushi about his antics, the {{production}} returned to Los Angeles. Filming there again ran smoothly, until {{it came time to}} shoot the final sequence at the Hollywood Palladium. Just <b>beforehand,</b> Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making it unlikely he could go through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top orthopedic surgeon to postpone his weekend plans long enough to stop by and sufficiently anesthetize Belushi's knee, and the scene was filmed as intended.|$|E
5|$|After the windmill, {{wind power}} {{applications}} in other devices and even vehicles {{were found in}} China. There was the 'sailing carriage' that appeared by at least the Ming dynasty in the 16th century (although {{it could have been}} known <b>beforehand).</b> European travelers to China in the late 16th century were surprised to find large single-wheel passenger and cargo wheelbarrows not only pulled by mule or horse, but also mounted with ship-like masts and sails to help push them along by the wind.|$|E
5|$|Another Green World was {{recorded}} at Island Studios in London {{during the months}} of July and August 1975. Brian Eno originally viewed his new album as an experiment and entered the recording studio with nothing written or prepared <b>beforehand.</b> For the first four days in the studio, Eno failed to be productive. To look for new ideas, Eno turned to his instructional cards, the Oblique Strategies, and began coming up with new ideas {{as he did with}} his previous album Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy).|$|E
5|$|Atheis was Mihardja's first novel; {{what few}} {{literary}} works {{he had written}} <b>beforehand</b> were mostly short stories and dramas, both those intended for the radio and the stage. He never formally studied writing, instead learning how to write fiction from his experiences reading existing works, including those of André Gide, Leo Tolstoy, Vsevolod Ivanov, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. His writing style was heavily influenced by that of Gide, particularly as found in The Immoralist (1902). Malay, the language which forms the basis of modern Indonesian, was not Mihardja's native language; his earlier works had all been in Sundanese, and Mihardja had only begun regularly using Indonesian after the Japanese occupation (1942–1945), {{when he became a}} translator.|$|E
5|$|Communication plans {{should be}} made <b>beforehand</b> to inform of {{mitigation}} actions being undertaken. Spare parts and back-up systems should be in place prior to ash fall events to reduce service disruption and return functionality as quickly as possible. Good preparedness also includes the identification of ash disposal sites, before ash fall occurs, to avoid further movement of ash and to aid clean-up. Protective equipment such as eye protection and dust masks should be deployed for clean-up teams in advance of ash fall events.|$|E
5|$|Contador {{first took}} the race lead {{after the second}} {{mountain}} stage, to Marmolada, by finishing nearly fifteen minutes ahead of previous race leader Gabriele Bosisio. The race's overall classification had been headed for several days <b>beforehand</b> by Giovanni Visconti, who participated in a breakaway in the sixth stage which won him sufficient time to hold the race leader's pink jersey {{for more than a}} week. In the race's final week, Contador faced stern challenges from Riccò and defending Giro champion Danilo Di Luca. Though Contador did not win any stage, his performances were consistently strong enough to remain ahead through to the conclusion of the race.|$|E
5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{has been}} {{promoted}} to Assistant Regional Manager {{and as a result}} is inspired to find ways to be more productive, for himself and the office. However, his ideas for the office are ignored by Andy, leading to a discussion with Jim in the warehouse about their increasing dissatisfaction with Dunder Mifflin. Jim tells Darryl about his sports marketing job opportunity in Philadelphia and offers him a possible position. However, as Jim has yet to tell Pam, Darryl says he should before going forward. When Pam comes back, Jim reveals the job opportunity to Pam, who, despite giving her approval, is upset that Jim did not consult her <b>beforehand.</b>|$|E
5|$|Del Piero's first {{appearance}} after the 2006 FIFA World Cup triumph {{was in a}} Coppa Italia match against Cesena on 23 August 2006. As Juventus played in the Serie B for the 2006–07 season, the Coppa Italia campaign became increasingly important for the club {{in order to achieve}} a UEFA Cup spot. Having been on vacation <b>beforehand,</b> Del Piero started on the bench. Juventus and Cesena were locked on 1–1 when Del Piero entered in the 74th minute and after nine seconds, he scored the winning goal for Juventus.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{there being}} only two flat stages (the first two road race days), many top-tier sprinters started the race, as the Tirreno–Adriatico is {{traditionally}} {{considered to be}} excellent preparation for Milan–San Remo. Every Milan–San Remo winner since Andrei Tchmil in 1999 raced Tirreno–Adriatico (rather than Paris–Nice) <b>beforehand.</b> Tyler Farrar, Tom Boonen, Alessandro Petacchi, André Greipel, world champion Thor Hushovd, the aforementioned McEwen, and the last two Milan–San Remo winners Mark Cavendish and Óscar Freire all started the race.|$|E
