The J-integral fracture mechanics approach was adopted and digital image correlation analysis was performed to measure the strain at the crack tip. The presence of carbon black modifies the maximum chain extensibility and strain-induced crystallizability of the rubber matrix in the compound. The formation of sideways cracks occurred in all filled compounds and resulted in a link to the maximum chain extensibility. Nevertheless, toughness enhancement was observed only when strain-induced crystallization took place at the crack tip before the onset of the forward crack...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Carbon black {{has been}} used as the main {{reinforcing}} fillers that increase the usefulness of rubbers. In this experiment, different compounds based on natural rubber were prepared with carbon black (N 330) at various loading ratios from 10 to 125 phr. The mechanical and thermal properties of rubber compounds were measured and the test data with SEM micrographs were analyzed to determine the suitable ratio of carbon black for the desired properties of rubber compound. The results showed that carbon black particles were well dispersed in compounds with loading ratios of 25 - 30 phr, corresponding to maximum tensile strength values. While with the increase of carbon black content, heat conductivity kept sustained increase. Fractal dimension characterized the degree of uneven dispersion of carbon <b>black</b> in rubber <b>fracture</b> surfaces. A particular value of fractal dimension was obtained to characterize the optimum mechanical property of carbon black filled natural rubber.

30|$|A {{significant}} percentage of hydrocarbon reservoirs {{around the world is}} fractured. Moreover, the major part of gas reservoirs in Iran is also fractured type, so the existence of an in-house software is necessary. In this study, an efficient, user-friendly, and indigenous simulation of a three-dimensional <b>black</b> oil <b>fractured</b> dry gas reservoir has been developed through IMPES method with the two-phase flow of gas and water. The presented simulator, which was written by C++ language and was known as fracture dry gas reservoir simulator, uses the implicit pressure and explicit saturation method for solving the equations. Also, effect of gravity pressure is neglected and effect of the capillary is considered in equations. By this simulator, we can investigate the dry gas reservoirs behavior with fractures. Darcy or non-Darcy fracture and matrix flow, Cartesian, cylindrical, and combination of Cartesian–cylindrical reservoir gridding, single porosity, dual porosity–single permeability, and dual porosity–dual permeability modeling are abilities of this simulator too. Additionally, this simulator is able to make outputs (such as pressure) at any given specific radius and time interval as numerical and/or graphical output in so little run time. Also, this simulator has PVT box and gridding box for doing the calculation of PVT and gridding. PVT box contains new correlations and EOS in comparison with another reservoir simulator. Gridding box makes us be able to simulate fractured dry gas reservoirs and hydraulically fractured well reservoirs too. Finally, the validity of this simulator was verified by comparing the simulation results with the other reservoir simulator (Eclipse) and showed a good compatibility between the developed software and Eclipse results in each time with different conditions such as various gridding conditions, various fluid data conditions and also various well configuration conditions.|$|R
30|$|Aminobisphosphonates (N-BPs) {{are widely}} used drugs for {{treatment}} of osteoporosis because of their strong inhibition of accelerated bone resorption and the consequent increase in bone mineral density and prevention of <b>fracture</b> (<b>Black</b> et al. 1996; Reginster et al. 2000; Matsumoto et al. 2009). Two phosphate side chains on the central carbon atom in the P–C–P backbone are mainly responsible for binding to bone, with complementary interactions through a hydroxyl group (Rogers 2003; Russell et al. 2008). N-BPs also have a nitrogen-containing side chain on the central carbon that determines the inhibitory potency for a target enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase. Therefore, the side chains determine the antiresorptive potency (Ebetino et al. 2011). Bone-bound N-BPs are internalized by bone-resorbing osteoclasts and reduce the bone resorption activity or viability of the cells through inhibition of FPP synthase. Release of bone-bound N-BPs is promoted by vacuolar H+-ATPase, which is localized along the ruffled borders of osteoclasts and pumps protons out onto the bone surface, and this release can be inhibited by inhibitors of V-ATPase such as bafilomycin A 1 (Takami et al. 2003).|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes struggles {{over the}} development of Barbadian health and sanitation during the period between the world wars. In doing so, it examines how the British Empire tried to use development policies to maintain its power overseas during the interwar years. During this period, British policymakers sought to improve health and sanitation to pacify restive Barbadian laborers influenced by transnational pan-African and socialist ideas following the First World War. However, white Barbadian elites, influenced by ideas of eugenics and population control, opposed metropolitan efforts to develop health and sanitation in the colony. Rather than repairing the colonial relationship, British development efforts instead resulted in a protracted legislative and public battle over health reform. White creole resistance to public health policies both destabilized British reform efforts and further undermined black Barbadian understandings of imperial identity. By the 1930 s, Pan-African critiques of empire, which the British government had fought to suppress following the First World War, found renewed energy {{in the midst of}} British failures to provide basic welfare services to poor <b>black</b> subjects. The <b>fractures</b> in these bonds of empire ultimately resulted in serious labor disturbances that re-emphasized the tensions of British colonialism and redirected the course of imperial policy. By focusing on these conflicts, this project reveals how struggles over colonial reforms on the ground transformed ideas of emerging nationhood, imperial identities, and British strategies of rule in the years leading up to decolonization...|$|R
40|$|The Devonian Antrim Shale is an organic-rich, {{naturally}} <b>fractured</b> <b>black</b> shale in the Michigan Basin {{that serves}} as both a source and reservoir for natural gas. A well-developed network of major, through-going vertical fractures controls reservoir-scale permeability in the Antrim Shale. Many fractures are open, but some are partially sealed by calcite cements that retain isotopic evidence of widespread microbial methanogenesis. Fracture filling calcite displays an unu-sually broad spectrum of d 13 C values (þ 34 to 41 % PDB), suggesting that both aerobic and anaerobic bacterial pro-cesses were active in the reservoir. Calcites with high d 13 C values (>þ 15 %) record cementation of fractures from dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) generated during bacterial methanogenesis. Calcites with low d 13 C values (< 32 %) are solely associated with outcrop samples and record methane oxidation during cement precipitation.

Identification of 13 C-rich calcite provides unambiguous evidence of biogenic methane generation and may be used to identify gas deposits in other sedimentary basins.

Due to the low incidence of these insufficiency <b>fractures,</b> <b>Black</b> et al. concluded that there was no increased risk associated with prolonged bisphosphonate therapy. Despite the large numbers of patients on alendronate therapy, the authors themselves eluded to the fact that their study was underpowered for definitive conclusions. Further weaknesses include the short duration of bisphosphonate therapy in most cases. Only 1, 000 of 15, 384 patients took bisphosphonates for > 4  years. Another limitation in the process was the lack of radiographs, and therefore the inability to assess for signs of atypia. The diagnosis of insufficiency fracture was again based on fracture site as per radiological report and history of a low-energy fracture.|$|R

Today, the bitumen is hard, brittle, and insoluble, but streamers how that in the past it was soft and viscous. In open cavities many of the blebs line up preferentially along organic-rich layers in the dolostone suggesting (though not proving) that the bitumen was "sweated " out of the organic-rich layers. This preferential alignment, plus the presence of sulfide chimneys, indicates that the bitumen is probably derived from an oil that was immobilized in the act of primary migration from the Cambrian Bonneterre Formation. The bitumen that we observed was most commonly found on the surface of galena and sphalerite crystals. Some bitumen was encased in calcite and dickite which are both generally considered to have formed after lead-zinc mineralization. Thus, paragenetically the bitumen is late and may have even been generated after mineralization. Elemental analyses how the blebs to be predominantly hydrocarbons with an H/C atomic ratio of around 1. 4 and an NSO content of 2. 6 percent. Pyrolysis gas chromatography of the blebs yields normal alkanes with up to 26 carbon atoms and no odd or even carbon preference.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of adhesion performance of bare Cu, as-deposited and surface-hardened black oxide coatings on Cu substrates was studied. The interfacial adhesion with a polyimide adhesive tape and an epoxy moulding compound {{was measured using}} the button shear and tape peel tests after hygrothermal ageing in an autoclave, high temperature ageing and thermal cycles. Moisture adsorption and desorption studies at different aging times suggested that the black oxide coating was effective in reducing the moisture adsorption. The bond strengths for all substrates remained almost unchanged after thermal ageing at 150 degrees C for 8 h. Thermal cycling between - 50 degrees C and 150 degrees C for 500 cycles reduced by about 20 % the button shear strength of the as-deposited black oxide substrate, but it did change much the bonding performance of the bare Cu substrate. Hygrothermal ageing at 121 degrees C/ 100 % RH in an autoclave was most detrimental to adhesion performance because of the combined effect of elevated temperature and high humidity. The reduction in button shear strength after the initial ageing for 48 h was 50 - 67 %, {{depending on the type}} of coating.

Results: At index visit, HIV-infected women were older [median age of 40 years (IQR: 34 – 46) vs. 35 (27 – 43), P, 0. 0001] {{and more likely to}} be postmenopausal, hepatitis C virus infected, and weigh less than HIV-uninfected women. Among HIV-infected women, mean CD 4 + count was 480 cells per microliter and 63 % were taking highly active antiretroviral therapy. Unadjusted incidence rates of any fracture were higher in HIV-infected than in HIV-uninfected women [2. 19 / 100 person-years (py) vs. 1. 54 / 100 py, P = 0. 002]. In multivariate models, HIV status, older age, white (vs. <b>black)</b> race, prior <b>fracture,</b> history of cocaine use, and history of injection drug use were significant predictors of incident fracture. Among HIV-infected women, age, white race, prior fracture, smoking, and prior AIDS were predictors of new fracture. Conclusions: Middle-aged HIV-infected women had a higher adjusted fracture rate than HIV-uninfected women. Cocaine use and injection drug use were also associated with a greater risk of incident fracture. Further research is needed to understand whether the risk of fracture associated with cocaine use relates to increased rate of falls or direct effects on bone metabolism...|$|R
