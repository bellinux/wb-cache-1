40|$|Therapeutic regimens {{containing}} beta-lactam antibiotics are selecting penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae populations {{all over}} the world. The selective pressure after 4 h of exposure to different concentrations of amoxicillin, cefixime, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime for low-level or high-level penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae was evaluated in an in vitro model with mixed populations with penicillin susceptibilities of 0. 015, 0. 5, 1, and 2 micrograms/ml. The <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentration</b> selecting for low-level resistance strongly reduced the susceptible population. Increasing <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations</b> tended to decrease the total proportion of penicillin-resistant bacteria because of reduced numbers of the low-level-resistant population. The <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentration</b> selecting for high-level resistance produced fewer resistant populations, {{but most of the}} organisms selected represented high-level resistance. In general, amoxicillin was a good selector for the low-level-resistant population and a poor selector for high-level resistance; cefuroxime and cefotaxime were poor selectors for low-level resistance and better selectors than amoxicillin for high-level penicillin resistance. Cefixime was the best selector of low-level penicillin resistance. When only resistant populations were mixed, the strains with high-level resistance were selected even at low <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Determination of the effects of selective <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations</b> on mixed cultures of bacteria expressing different antibiotic resistance levels may help researchers to understand the ecology and epidemiology of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae populations...|$|R

40|$|Human use of {{antibiotics}} has driven the selective enrichment of pathogenic bacteria resistant to clinically used drugs. Traditionally, the selection of resistance has been considered to occur mainly at high, therapeutic levels {{of antibiotics}}, but we {{are now beginning to}} understand better the importance of selection of resistance at low levels of <b>antibiotics.</b> The <b>concentration</b> of an <b>antibiotic</b> varies in different body compartments during treatment, and low <b>concentrations</b> of <b>antibiotics</b> are found in sewage water, soils, and many water environments due to natural production and contamination from human activities. Selection of resistance at non-lethal <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations</b> (below the wild-type minimum inhibitory concentration) occurs due to differences in growth rate at the particular <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentration</b> between cells with different tolerance levels to the antibiotic. The minimum selective concentration for a particular antibiotic is reached when its reducing effect on growth of the susceptible strain balances the reducing effect (fitness cost) of the resistance determinant in the resistant strain. Recent studies have shown that resistant bacteria can be selected at concentrations several hundred-fold below the lethal concentrations for susceptible cells. Resistant mutants selected at low <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations</b> are generally more fit than those selected at high concentrations but can still be highly resistant.

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of antibiotics is selecting {{for a variety of}} resistance mechanisms that seriously challenge our ability to treat bacterial infections. Resistant bacteria can be selected at the high <b>concentrations</b> of <b>antibiotics</b> used therapeutically, but what role the much lower <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations</b> present in many environments plays in selection remains largely unclear. Here we show using highly sensitive competition experiments that selection of resistant bacteria occurs at extremely low <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Thus, for three clinically important <b>antibiotics,</b> drug <b>concentrations</b> up to several hundred-fold below the minimal inhibitory concentration of susceptible bacteria could enrich for resistant bacteria, even when present at a very low initial fraction.

40|$|AMS: 60 J 80 In {{this paper}} a {{stochastic}} model for describing {{one of the}} possible un-derlying biological mechanisms of postantibiotic effect (PAE) (the delayed re-growth of the bacteria after complete removal of an antibiotic) is formulated. The model {{is based on the}} theory of penicillin binding proteins (PBPs), where the PAE is the time required by the bacteria to synthesize new PBPs before growth. Newly synthesized PBPs are unsaturated and becomes saturated un-der antibiotic pressure and eventually removed due to death. The model assumes that unsaturated PBPs are attached (synthesized) to a bacterium according to a Poisson process and that these are saturated with an intensity proportional to the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentration</b> of the treatment. The calculations and results are divided into three simplifying steps toward a more realistic approach. At first, we assume constant <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentration</b> and no initial PBPs. Secondly, we assume constant <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentration,</b> but with an initial set of unsaturated PBPs (no saturated PBPs). Thirdly, we assume exponentially declining <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentration</b> and the same initial set of unsaturated PBPs. The stochastic models are solved using a set of Kolmogorov equations and exact solutions with interesting properties can be derived for all three steps. The results are useful for giving {{a better understanding of the}} time properties of PAE. 1...|$|R
30|$|Hardness of AIBC is an {{important}} biomechanical parameter that helps determine the long-term success of implant devices. As a higher antibiotic dose compromises the hardness {{as well as other}} mechanical properties, the dose of such additives should be optimized. The results demonstrate that (a) {{there was no significant difference}} in the hardness values between wet and dry specimens and (b) there was minimal correlation between the duration of elution and the hardness of the specimens, although there was a significant decrease in hardness as the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentration</b> was increased (p[*]≤[*] 0.05). Further experimentation would have to be done to investigate the hardness against elution kinetics between hand-mixed specimen and vacuum-mixed specimen. This study has added necessary information illustrating that hardness is compromised as <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations</b> increase; this allows future prosthesis operations to adjust their <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations</b> to attain the best antibiotic therapy without compromising the hardness significantly.|$|R

40|$|Published CRRT drug dosing {{algorithms}} {{and other}} dosing guidelines appear {{to result in}} underdosed antibiotics, leading to failure to attain pharmacodynamic targets. High mortality rates persist with inadequate antibiotic therapy {{as the most important}} risk factor for death. Reasons for unintended antibiotic underdosing in patients receiving CRRT are many. Underdosing may result from lack of the recognition that better hepatic function in AKI patients yields higher nonrenal antibiotic clearance compared to ESRD patients. Other factors include the variability in body size and fluid composition of patients, the serious consequence of delayed achievement of antibiotic pharmacodynamic targets in septic patients, potential subtherapeutic <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations</b> at the infection site, and the influence of RRT intensity on <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Too often, clinicians weigh the benefits of overcautious antibiotic dosing to avoid antibiotic toxicity too heavily against the benefits of rapid attainment of therapeutic <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations</b> in critically ill patients receiving CRRT.

30|$|Our {{previous}} {{study showed that}} the presence of high <b>concentrations</b> of <b>antibiotics</b> (oxytetracycline, >  19.5  mg L− 1) in a biological WWTP could lead to the occurrence of tetracycline resistance and MDR in treated wastewater and downstream rivers (Li et al. 2010). Similar results have also been observed in antibiotic production WWTPs accepting penicillin and spiramycin production wastewater (Li et al. 2009, 2011; Liu et al. 2014). However, most of these studies have been derived from investigative results of full-scale real WWTPs, and do not reveal the influence of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Recently some effort has been made to investigate the influence of minimum <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations</b> on the transfer of MDR under controlled experimental conditions. Under such studies, concentrations of tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole, as low as 10 – 100  µg L− 1 were found to promote MDR through the horizontal dissemination of mobile resistance elements (Jutkina et al. 2016; Kim et al. 2014). However, pure cultures and overnight culture times have often been adopted for these experiments, which {{may not be able to}} reveal the impact of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations</b> on the wastewater treatment bacteria.|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} described {{phenomenon of}} band-pass antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria {{exposed to a}} periodic environment of oscillating <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentration</b> grow fastest at intermediate period lengths.

30|$|A further {{consideration}} for optimizing antibiotic exposure relates to antibiotic penetration into the interstitial fluid (ISF) of tissues, {{which is the}} site of most infections.

To our knowledge, no studies have adjusted antibiotic doses based on presumed ISF distribution. Problematic to such an approach is that <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations</b> appears to vary between different tissues, suggesting that different plasma target concentrations may be required for the same bacteria depending on the tissue that is the source of infection.|$|R

The activity of this antibiotic was also measured using a pyranine fluorescence detected K+/H+ exchange assay. Nystatin mean fluorescence lifetime varied with the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentration</b> and ergosterol content (0 – 30 mol%) of the lipid vesicles. It sharply increased from 5 to 37 ns upon reaching 100 molecules per liposome, reporting nystatin oligomerization in the membrane. Concomitantly, spectral alterations typical of excitonic coupling were detected {{and there was}} a pronounced increase in the initial rate of pore formation by nystatin. These findings suggest that nystatin exerts its antibiotic activity via a two-stage mechanism: at low <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations,</b> surface-adsorbed monomeric <b>antibiotic</b> molecules perturb the lipid packing, changing the permeability properties of the ergosterol-rich liposomes. Upon reaching a critical threshold, nystatin mode of action switches to the classical model of transmembrane aqueous channel formation. In the presence of cholesterol-containing POPC liposomes, neither nystatin spectroscopic properties, nor the kinetics of K+ efflux varied with the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentration</b> suggesting that in this case the first stage of antibiotic mode of action always prevails or the assemblies formed by nystatin and cholesterol are very loose...|$|R

Specimens of blood and peritoneal washings from the infected animals were assayed for <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations</b> and examined microscopically for observation of the effects produced by the two penicillins on the morphology of bacteria growing in vivo. Amoxycillin was significantly more effective than ampicillin in protecting the animals from the lethal effects of the infection, although the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the body fluids were very similar for both compounds. However, microscopic examination showed marked differences in the morphological effects produced at equivalent dose levels by the two compounds against the bacteria present in blood and peritoneal fluid.
