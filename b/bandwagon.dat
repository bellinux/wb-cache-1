5|$|Asda's latest {{attempt to}} draw {{attention}} to themselves involves trying to leap on the Harry Potter <b>bandwagon.</b> This is just another example of their repeated efforts of appearing as Robin Hood in the face of controversy about their worldwide group, which would suggest they are perceived as more akin to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Loss leaders were invented by supermarkets and {{have nothing to do with}} Bloomsbury Publishing or Harry Potter and we deeply regret having been dragged into their price-wars.|$|E
5|$|Other bands {{during that}} part of the '80's, both major and not-so-major acts, were really getting on the {{political}} <b>bandwagon</b> for one stupid reason or another. They were all so fucking serious, trying to be a voice for a generation or some shit like that, but worst of all they remained within the parameters of social acceptability. There was also a big censorship flap going on at the time. We looked at it as a chance to catch up with our obscenity quota.|$|E
5|$|Ryan {{is an avid}} hockey fan and has {{developed}} a notoriety of being a <b>bandwagon</b> jumper in recent years. Ryan has admitted he was {{a fan of the}} Toronto Maple Leafs, as a result of growing up in the city, but upon taking the Jets head coaching job, he was often seen cheering for all three of the New York metropolitan area franchises. During the New Jersey Devils run to the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals, Ryan was seen sporting the team's attire, and he was seen donning the attire of the New York Rangers two years later, during their run to the Stanley Cup Final. Outside of the playoff runs, Ryan performed a ceremonial puck drop at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum on October 9, 2010, wearing a vintage New York Islanders Billy Smith jersey.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bandwagoning</b> in {{international}} relations occurs when a state aligns with a stronger, adversarial power and concedes that the stronger adversary-turned-partner disproportionately gains in the spoils they conquer together. <b>Bandwagoning,</b> therefore, is a strategy employed by weak states. The logic stipulates that an outgunned, weaker state should align itself with a stronger adversary because the latter can take what it wants by force anyway. Thucydides' famous dictum that [...] "the strong {{do what they can}} and the weak suffer what they must" [...] captures the essence of <b>bandwagoning.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{success of}} the music {{produced}} by the movement and its passage from underground phenomenon to mainstream genre, prompted its main promoter Geoff Barton to declare the NWOBHM finished in 1981. He felt disappointed by the low quality of the new bands and frustrated by {{the ease with which}} record labels exploited enthusiasm for heavy metal. Coincidentally, in the same year, the <b>Bandwagon</b> was closed and the Prince of Wales pub was subsequently demolished to build a restaurant. Although the movement had lost some of its appeal for diehard fans, as evidenced by the increased popularity of American-influenced AOR releases on sales-based national polls, it retained enough vitality to launch a second wave of bands, which rose from the underground and released their first albums in 1982 and 1983.|$|E
5|$|While McClellan's {{reputation}} {{has suffered}} over time, especially {{over the last}} 75 years, {{there is a small}} but intense cadre of American Civil War historians who believe that the general has been poorly served on at least four levels. First, McClellan proponents say that because the general was a conservative Democrat with great personal charisma, radical Republicans fearing his political potential deliberately undermined his field operations. Second, that as the radical Republicans were the true winners coming out of the American Civil War, they were able to write its history, placing their principal political rival of the time, McClellan, in the worst possible light. Third, that historians eager to jump on the <b>bandwagon</b> of Lincoln as America's greatest political icon worked to outdo one another in shifting blame for early military failures from Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to McClellan. And fourth, that Lincoln and Stanton deliberately undermined McClellan because of his conciliatory stance towards the South, which might have resulted in a less destructive end to the war had Richmond fallen {{as a result of the}} Peninsula Campaign. Proponents of this school claim that McClellan is criticized more for his admittedly abrasive personality than for his actual field performance.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Kornheiser {{created a}} string of now-famous <b>Bandwagon</b> columns to {{describe}} the Washington Redskins' Super Bowl run that year. He started the idea when the Redskins trounced the Detroit Lions 41-10. He officially unveiled the first <b>Bandwagon</b> column when the team had an undefeated 4-0 record. From then on, the <b>Bandwagon</b> column appeared weekly. When the Redskins advanced to Super Bowl XXVI, Kornheiser and his Post colleagues Jeanne McManus and Norman Chad rode a handcar on a railroad track decorated as the <b>Bandwagon</b> for a 1,200-mile journey to Minneapolis, Minnesota.|$|E

50|$|Realists {{claim that}} {{balancing}} is when states ally against the prevailing threat {{and results in}} a more secure world whereas in a <b>bandwagoning</b> world security is scarce as rising hegemons are not kept in check. With <b>bandwagoning,</b> the threatened state abandons hope of preventing the aggressor from gaining power at its expense and instead joins forces with its dangerous foe {{to get at least}} some small portion of the spoils of war.|$|R

50|$|<b>Bandwagoning</b> {{was coined}} by Quincy Wright in A Study of War (1942: 136) and popularized by Kenneth Waltz in Theory of International Politics (1979: 126) (in his work, Waltz {{incorrectly}} attributes Stephen Van Evera with coining the term). Both Wright and Waltz employ the concept {{to serve as}} the opposite of balancing behavior. <b>Bandwagoning</b> occurs when weaker states decide that the cost of opposing a stronger power exceeds the benefits. The stronger power may offer incentives, such as the possibility of territorial gain, trade agreements, or protection, to induce weaker states to join with it.|$|R

25|$|At a {{time when}} the women's {{suffrage}} movement was much in the news, in March 1914 Kalem Studios' competitor Pathé Frères released an adventure film serial titled The Perils of Pauline.

As a result, Kalem Studios jumped on the <b>bandwagon</b> and in November 1914 released their own adventure series called The Hazards of Helen.|$|E
25|$|Moore {{showed how}} firms could attain this enviable {{position}} by using E.M. Rogers' five stage adoption process {{and focusing on}} one group of customers at a time, using each group {{as a base for}} reaching the next group. The most difficult step is making the transition between introduction and mass acceptance. (See Crossing the Chasm). If successful a firm can create a <b>bandwagon</b> effect in which the momentum builds and its product becomes a de facto standard.|$|E
25|$|Other criticisms {{focused on}} {{practical}} implementation by service providers include that: the recovery {{model can be}} manipulated by officials to serve various political and financial interests including withdrawing services and pushing people out before they're ready; that it is becoming a new orthodoxy or <b>bandwagon</b> that neglects the empowerment aspects and structural problems of societies and primarily represents a middle class experience; that it hides the continued dominance of a medical model; and that it potentially increases social exclusion and marginalizes those who don't fit into a recovery narrative.|$|E
30|$|If the {{outcomes}} of war and aggressive foreign policies in asymmetric relations cause high costs {{than those of the}} negotiation in and management of asymmetric relations, political agents will seek to maintain the asymmetric relations by looking for what they can do for each other’s interests. From realists’ perspective therefore, asymmetry in international relations is the most crucial international factor that forces small states to choose either balancing or <b>bandwagoning.</b> Although whether small states choose balancing or <b>bandwagoning</b> is contingent on internal and external situations small states face, states are more likely to prefer the less costly to the more costly result. Unlike the dominant wisdom of conventional international relations theories, small states even actively accommodate a large power when they find rationality to create a structure to maximize their interests: security and autonomy. In addition, if political actors could attain an instrument to ensure their interests in domestic politics, the most rational choice of both political agents and actors in asymmetry will be <b>bandwagoning</b> rather than balancing.|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} hybrid {{instruments}} exist, crossing the banjo with other stringed instruments. Most of these use {{the body of}} a banjo, often with a resonator, and the neck of the other instrument. Examples include the banjo mandolin (first patented in 1882) and the banjo ukulele or banjolele, most famously played by the English comedian George Formby. These were especially popular {{in the early decades of}} the twentieth century, and were probably a result of a desire either to allow players of other instruments to jump on the banjo <b>bandwagon</b> at the height of its popularity, or to get the natural amplification benefits of the banjo resonator in an age before electric amplification.|$|E
25|$|Other {{airlines}} and tour operators {{were quick to}} jump on the burgeoning package holiday <b>bandwagon.</b> This resulted in increasingly fierce competition between operators and led to a price warfare to fill planes and hotels. Under Tom Gullick's management, Shipping Industrial Holdings subsidiary Clarksons Holidays became the undisputed cut-price leader in the IT market. By 1973, Clarksons carried 1.1 million holidaymakers — almost 1968's whole industry total — and contracted over 70% of Court Line's charter capacity. Its meteoric rise was entirely volume-based. It generated the required volumes by ruthlessly undercutting rivals and outbidding them to win the race for securing accommodation in popular overseas holiday resorts, especially in Spain. Thus, in the early 1970s, a holiday in Majorca or on the Costa del Sol became affordable for the average person for the first time.|$|E
25|$|Macleod {{believed}} that the Earl of Home (later Sir Alec Douglas-Home after he had disclaimed his peerage) had behaved with less than complete honesty. He had initially appeared to rule himself out and had offered to help sample Cabinet opinion, before announcing his own candidacy. Macleod did not initially take Home's candidacy seriously, and did not realise {{the degree to which}} Macmillan was promoting it. When first told by his PPS Reginald Bennett that Home might be a candidate for the succession, Macleod snapped “Don’t talk nonsense” and “absolute rot; it’s not a possibility.” Macleod gave his usual excellent conference speech at Blackpool on 11 October, unlike Maudling and Butler, who damaged their leadership chances by giving poor speeches, but Home’s leadership <b>bandwagon</b> grew despite a mediocre but rapturously received speech.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, Waltz {{contrasts}} balancing with <b>bandwagoning,</b> {{in which}} weaker states choose to ally with the stronger state.

40|$|Realist {{scholars}} have been {{challenged by the}} growing European integration in defence issues. In particular, Neorealism, given its exclusive focus on systemic variables, has been considered either inadequate or obsolete. However, we argue that Realism {{offers a variety of}} analytical tools that may be used to account for the ESDP/CSDP process. Still from a systemic perspective, we suggest that the efforts to forge a common security and defense policy originated not from within the EU, but from the outside – namely the Transatlantic relationship. This approach has traditionally led Realists to refine the concept of balance of power. Contrary to this view, in this chapter we discuss the potential of <b>bandwagoning</b> as an explanatory concept. Put it differently, our argument is that European states resorted to CSDP in order to contribute to, not to counter, the Transatlantic relationship – i. e., the European states have <b>bandwagoned</b> with the USA...|$|R
25|$|In writing 1632, Flint's web forum Mutter of Demons at Baen's Bar {{was soon}} {{taken over by}} {{exploratory}} posts as captivated readers commented on the E-ARC released book, creating a ground swell of interest ("Internet buzz") {{in the months before}} its hardcover release. So strong was the response, especially after the release of the printed work, that a new 1632 Tech Manual sub-forum was created for discussions about it in early 2000, for the discussions had also spilled over into Weber's Bu-ships tech forum, and Weber joined the <b>bandwagon</b> by suggesting a sequel was in order. In the event, the two co-wrote 1633 and collaborated further on integrating the short fiction (much of it unsolicited) into the de facto Ring of Fire sequel. It was followed by two other related forums: 1632 Slush and 1632 Comments, within the next two years.|$|E
25|$|The Blitz Kids {{described}} the {{movement as a}} retaliation to punk due to it becoming too violent and unsavory crowds such as neo-Nazis and skinheads deciding to jump on that aesthetic <b>bandwagon.</b> It was also a way to forget their relative poverty following the economic recession and the Winter of Discontent. Features of New Romantic clothing varied from individual to individual, although these generally highlighted the implied individualism, creativity and self-expression of the movement, besides its continued adherence to the DIY ethic of punk. It was inspired by different cultures and time periods, films, film noir, and theatricality. Men often wore dramatic cosmetics and androgynous clothing, including ruffled poet shirts, red or blue hussar jackets with gold braid, silk sashes, tight pants, shiny rayon waistcoats, and tailcoats based on those worn during the Regency era. Women, too, were very theatrical in terms of makeup and style, and often favoured big hair, fishnet gloves, corsets, crushed velvet, and elements of Middle Eastern and gypsy clothing.|$|E
25|$|Around June 220, Qu Yan (麴演) rebelled {{again in}} Xiping Commandery {{and managed to}} garner support in two {{neighbouring}} commanderies, Zhangye and Jiuquan. His allies, Zhang Jin (張進) and Huang Hua (黃華), rebelled against Du Tong (杜通) and Xin Ji (辛機), the Administrators of Zhangye and Jiuquan respectively, and declared themselves the new Administrators. Zhang Jin even took Du Tong hostage. To make things worse, the non-Han Chinese tribes in Wuwei Commandery {{seized the opportunity to}} start raiding and pillaging counties, while other local elites (both Han Chinese and non-Han Chinese) throughout Yong and Liang provinces wanted to jump on the <b>bandwagon</b> and join the rebels. The rebellions caused a major disruption in trade flows along the Hexi Corridor. Guanqiu Xing (毌丘興), the Administrator of Wuwei Commandery, sent an urgent report to Su Ze in Jincheng Commandery and sought his aid in dealing with the rebels. At the time, Su Ze had with him two military officers, Hao Zhao and Wei Ping (魏平), who were in command of Jincheng Commandery's armed forces. However, they were not allowed to lead the troops into battle without authorisation from the Han central government.|$|E

40|$|In {{the article}} ‘Bandwagoning, not Balancing: Why Europe Confounds Realism’, we {{advanced}} {{the argument that}} realism continues to be relevant to explain EU defence integration in the post-Cold War era. However, we contended {{that it is necessary}} for scholars to return to the concept of <b>bandwagoning</b> which is better suited than balancing to explain trans-Atlantic security cooperation. Writing in this same journal, Benjamin Pohl argues that the role of states’ relative power in foreign policy behaviour is misleading, since neither balancing nor <b>bandwagoning</b> are useful concepts to explain Europe’s security policy in the post-Cold War period. As Pohl asserts, ‘EU governments have followed an inductive and experimental approach’, thus emphasising the liberal basis of his counter-argument. While being an important alternative approach (which we also acknowledge as such in our article), liberalism tends to emphasise cooperative practices and ideologies. However, in so doing this, it can overlook the role played by international competition in shaping ESDP/CSD...|$|R
