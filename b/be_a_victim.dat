5|$|The {{character}} {{has said he}} was regularly beaten up in high school, {{and by the time}} he left for college he was determined never to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> again. As such, on the first day of his freshman year he walked into class and punched the first person he saw (unfortunately, this happened to be his ethics professor). He attended Dartmouth College (instead of his first pick, Hogwarts, claiming that his white owl led them to reject him), and was a member of the ΣΑΕ fraternity, although his acceptance into the college appears to have been largely influenced by a claimed familial relationship with a wealthy donor, and graduated in the top 47 percent of his class with a major in history. He has also referred to Bob Jones University as an alma mater.|$|E
5|$|When Joan {{comes to}} speak with Charles, the Dauphin pretends to be a common member of the court while someone else pretends to be him. Joan is able {{to see through the}} ruse and {{immediately}} proclaims that she is sent to restore the French crown to him at Rheims. Charles has her examined by priests and scholars to determine that she is free of black magic. While questioned, Joan describes how God came to her with visions and describes her faith in a similar manner to deism. This causes the examiners to believe that she is a heretic until a blue flame appears along with a sound, which is enough to silence any doubts about her faith. The flame reveals a suit of armour for her, but one individual interrupts her immediate donning of the armour to claim that France is cursed and that she would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim.</b> The individual, as it turns out, is Conrade, who blames himself that Joan left her peaceful life to help a French court that was corrupt. He also warns her that he experienced a vision of her burning at the stake.|$|E

Social myth is [...] "Why don't these women who are locked up ask for help at the time? Why don't they come out {{screaming}} {{that they are in}} these places where they are being exploited sexually, if as a society we know this is wrong?" [...] Because the victims do not know, because they have a great ignorance about international treaties signed by our country, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> great ignorance that our country is abolitionist.|$|R

25|$|Although {{there is}} a popular {{perception}} in Scotland that Anti-Catholicism is football related (specifically directed against fans of Celtic F.C.), statistics released in 2004 by the Scottish Executive showed that 85% of sectarian attacks were not football related. Sixty-three percent {{of the victims of}} sectarian attacks are Catholics, but when adjusted for population size this makes Catholics between five and eight times more likely to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of a sectarian attack than a Protestant.|$|E
25|$|Upon his arrest, Andersen {{initially}} denied having {{anything to}} do with the murders, even when confronted with DNA evidence. Moments later, when lead interrogator Geir Hansen suggested that Andersen himself could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> in the case, Andersen delivered a full confession, naming 21-year-old Viggo Kristiansen as his accomplice. As a result, police immediately arrested Kristiansen. The two suspects were close friends, had served in the military Home Guard together and had been seen by witnesses near the crime scene on the day of the murders.|$|E

25|$|The killer's unusual {{attitude}} towards {{the police and the}} media received widespread scrutiny. Psychologists observed that many serial killers gain gratification by eluding pursuers and observers. The feeling of control of media, law enforcement, and even entire populations provides a source of social power for them. After consulting with several psychiatrists, police released a psychological profile of their suspect on May 26, 1977. He was described as neurotic and probably suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and believed himself to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of demonic possession.|$|E

The shows were then archived on his website. The format of the show often includes Green taking live telephone calls and Skype video calls where viewers around the world are able to chat with Green and his guests. Green would often <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of prank calls due to the live nature of the show and would sometimes voice his frustration with the callers. On top of the live web show, Green has added many video segments from his past as well as present.|$|E
25|$|Born in 1939 in Vietnam, Raymond Belle {{was the son}} of a French {{physician}} and Vietnamese mother. During the First Indochina War, his father died and he was separated from his mother, after which he was sent to a military orphanage in Da Lat at the age of 7. He took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order to never <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim.</b> At night, when everyone else was asleep, he would be outside running or climbing trees. He would use the military obstacle courses in secret, and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance, strength, and flexibility. Doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood, but also eventually to thrive. After the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, he returned to France and remained in military education until the age of 19, when he joined the Paris Fire Brigade, a French Army unit.|$|E

25|$|Florida Coalition Against Human Trafficking (www.stophumantrafficking.org): {{based in}} Clearwater, Florida. FCAHT’s founder, Anna Rodriguez, {{had her first}} {{experience}} with a Human Trafficking case in 1999; U.S. vs. Tecum. Anna served as a victim advocate with the Collier County Sheriff’s Office and an outreach coordinator for the Immokalee Shelter for Abused Women in Collier County, Florida for 10 years. Her first human trafficking case developed from a “home visitation”, in where she was following up on a domestic violence incident. She noticed {{the presence of a}} young female who turned out to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of human trafficking. Anna identified “red flags” that made her suspicious and eventually she helped get the victim out. Today the Tecum case has become a major case study by agencies including USDOJ, FSU, Croft Institute for International and New York Times. The Tecum case was one of the cases used to urge US Congress in passing the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.|$|E
25|$|The {{journey was}} a series of {{straight}} single-carriageway roads across foggy moors interrupted by predictable bottlenecks for most of the journey to Blyth, Nottinghamshire, where it met the A1. The accident rate was consequently high, and the journey of most of Hull's traffic was similar to that faced by much of Lincolnshire's drivers today. Debates in Parliament were held on the low standard of the windy route across the wind-swept plains around Goole. It was not unexpected that under these conditions, a Humber Bridge, with connecting dual-carriageway approach roads, and grade-separated junctions, would seem worthwhile. By the time the bridge opened, much of this well-below-standard route had been transformed by dualling of the A63 and its bypasses, the extension of the M62, and the much-needed connecting of the M18 from Thorne to Wadworth. The obvious need for a Humber Bridge had largely been tempered by the late 1970s with the much-improved motorway infrastructure of the region. Although welcome, the timing of these improvements would detract any significant levels of traffic needing to cross a bridge from Hessle to Barton. The Humber Bridge would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of the M62's success, before opening.|$|E

500|$|Ana Lucia was {{described}} by Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer as [...] "demanding", [...] "hostile" [...] and a [...] "bully". She called Ana Lucia a [...] "brooding, broken ex-cop" [...] with a [...] "perpetual scowl". McFarland described the character as someone with a [...] "take-charge nature", and an [...] "inability to be reasoned away from her dictatorial decisions". Anna Johns from AOL's TV Squad felt Ana Lucia is [...] "abrasive and lacking common sense or civility". C. K. Sample, also from TV Squad, thought Ana Lucia was [...] "angry", [...] "power mad" [...] and a [...] "total nut job". According to supervising producer Leonard Dick, [...] "Ana Lucia is somebody who {{does not want to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim.</b> She was a victim once and she swore to herself she would never <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> again". Rodriguez described the character as [...] "very intuitive", adding [...] "I like that the character is pretty much always aware and suspicious".

500|$|Saw, {{like its}} film predecessors, {{is set in}} the fictional Saw {{universe}} in an unnamed urban American city. The overlying storyline follows that of a man named John Kramer. According to the backstory in the film Saw IV, John encountered a series of events, including the loss of his unborn child, his diagnosis of an inoperable frontal lobe tumor, his divorce from his wife, and a failed suicide attempt that caused him to begin testing other people's will to live. These tests, which ironically killed many of his victims, {{and the fact that he}} symbolically carved a puzzle piece out of the flesh of his victims, soon earned him the alias [...] "The Jigsaw Killer" [...] from newspaper reporter Oswald McGullicuty. Due to the chronology of Saw, Jigsaw is still alive and his apprentice Amanda is still assumed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> rather than an accomplice.|$|E
