5|$|About 90% of beetle species enter {{a period}} of adult diapause, a quiet phase with reduced {{metabolism}} to tide unfavourable environmental conditions. Adult diapause {{is the most common}} form of diapause in Coleoptera. To endure the period without food (often lasting many months) adults prepare by accumulating reserves of lipids, glycogen, proteins and other substances needed for resistance to future hazardous changes of environmental conditions. This diapause is induced by signals heralding the arrival of the unfavourable season; usually the cue is photoperiodic. Short (decreasing) day length serves as a signal of approaching winter and induces winter diapause (hibernation). A study of hibernation in the Arctic beetle Pterostichus brevicorni showed that the <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> levels of adults were highest in autumn with the alimentary canal filled with food, but empty by the end of January. This loss of <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> was a gradual process, occurring in combination with dehydration.|$|E

5|$|Bears of {{northern}} regions, including the American black bear and the grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter. During hibernation, the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A fecal plug is {{formed in the}} colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. If they have stored enough <b>body</b> <b>fat,</b> their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea.

Donor <b>fat</b> <b>bodies</b> from various ages of larvae were accepted (remained unencapsulated) in tu-Sz ts hosts whereas <b>fat</b> <b>bodies</b> from donors with everted spiracles and all subsequent stages of development that were tested were rejected (encapsulated). Since the demarcation between acceptance and rejection by the tu-Sz ts blood cells did not coincide with the gross morphological changes that appear in the <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> during metamorphosis (dissolution of the basement membrane and dispersal of the freed <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> cells at pupation), we compared acceptable and nonacceptable <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> surfaces by three other methods. <b>Fat</b> <b>body</b> surface ultrastructure was examined, <b>fat</b> <b>bodies</b> were treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated lectins, and <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> surfaces were reacted with a monoclonal antibody specific for basement membrane.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} {{and release}} of lipid in vitro by the <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> of adult female Pyrrhocoris apterus, and the lipid content {{and composition of}} the haemolymph were examined {{in relation to the}} cyclic growth and diminution of the <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> and the probable contribution of lipid from the <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> to the developing oocytes. The <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> released lipid at a constant rate during most of the reproductive cycle and in non-reproducing (diapausing or ovariectomized) females. On the other hand, {{the rate at which the}} <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> incorporated lipid in vitro was markedly reduced during the period of major oocyte growth (days 3 - 5 following the larval-adult ecdysis), while it remained high during the corresponding period after ovariectomy and was low in diapause. The change in rate of lipid incorporation appears to account for the change in the <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> from net accumulation of lipid (days 1 - 3) to net loss of lipid (during rapid oocyte growth on days 3 - 5). Several characteristics of lipid incorporation and mobilization in vitro by the Pyrrhocoris <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> are different from those of the few other insect species studied and from mammalian adipose tissues. In Pyrrhocoris, haemolymph or bovine serum albumin is required for the maximum rate of incorporation, which is ten times higher than that reported for other insects. The <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> of Pyrrhocoris is not dependent on an external source of glyceride-glycerol for the esterification of fatty acids. Lipid is released at a much slower rate than found in other insect species. The primary class of lipid released is triglyceride, the form in which lipid is stored in the <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> and which predominates among lipid classes in the haemolymph. The importance of the method used to label the <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> is discussed. The haemolymph of adult female Pyrrhocoris is normally filled with lipid droplets and lipid-filled cells which closely resemble <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> cells. It is suggested that the release of lipid-filled cells from the <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> constitutes one phase of the mobilization of <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> lipid...|$|R

5|$|All swifts feed on insects {{caught in}} flight, and the Pacific swift has been {{recorded}} as consuming bees, wasps, termites, moths and flies. A Chinese study found that it caught {{a wide variety of}} insect prey and considered that most of the species eaten were harmful to agriculture or forestry. The Pacific swift tends to hunt higher than sympatric swifts, sharing its airspace mainly with white-throated needletails. It typically feeds at heights up to , only flying close to the ground in poor weather. It often forages near low-pressure areas, which serve both to raise insects from the ground and to give the swifts additional lift. The swifts circle through the insect swarms in flocks typically of tens or hundreds of birds, although sometimes reaching tens of thousands in Australia. In Siberia, Pacific swifts feed at dusk to much later hours than the common swift, sometimes until midnight, and migrants have been seen flying with bats in the Philippines. The young are brought balls of insects bound with saliva. In bad weather, they are sometimes not fed for days, surviving on stored <b>body</b> <b>fat.</b>|$|E
40|$|The insect <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> plays {{a central}} role in insect {{metabolism}} and nutrient storage, mirroring functions of the liver and fat tissue in vertebrates. Insect <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> tissue is usually distributed throughout the insect body. However, it is often concentrated in the abdomen and attached to the abdominal body wall. The mosquito <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> is the sole source of yolk proteins, which are critical for egg production. Therefore, the in vitro culture of mosquito <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> tissues represents an important system for the study of mosquito physiology, metabolism, and, ultimately, egg production.

As with many other Australian birds, such as the superb fairywren, infidelity is the norm for emus, despite the initial pair bond: once the male starts brooding, the female usually wanders off, and may mate with other males and lay in multiple nests; thus, as many as half the chicks in a brood may not be fathered by the incubating male, or even by either parent, as emus also exhibit brood parasitism.|$|E

5|$|Women develop {{long-term}} {{complications of}} alcohol dependence {{more rapidly than}} do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to {{have a negative effect on}} reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation, decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking. The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally have a higher percentage of <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.|$|E
40|$|The <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> of adult, female Pyrrhocoris apterus {{undergoes}} cyclic {{growth and}} diminution correlated with cycles of oocyte maturation. At all stages lipid accounts for 80 per {{cent of the}} dry weight of the <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> {{and the content of}} lipid, protein, and glycogen change in proportion to the changes in dry weight. The fatty acid composition of the lipid in <b>fat</b> <b>body,</b> ovaries, the whole insect, and the diet was examined by gas-liquid chromatography. Pyrrhocoris is similar to other insects in having triglyceride as the predominant class of lipid in the <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> but is distinctive in having an unusually high (more than 50 per cent) proportion of linoleate among its fatty acids, presumably owing to its diet. Reasons are presented for considering that little, if any, fatty acid is synthesized by the <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> and the ovaries during the reproductive cycle. During the first 5 days after the larval-adult ecdysis the Pyrrhocoris <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> first accumulates lipid and then releases it for utilization by the ovary. This temporary storage by the <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> compensates for the apparent inability of the insect to ingest a sufficient amount of lipid during vitellogenesis. The ovary normally utilizes dietary lipid as well during vitellogenesis; when the dietary supply was experimentally interrupted the amount of lipid released by the <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> increased. Storage of lipid in the <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> represents an important physiological adaptation since it frees the insect from dependence on a constant food supply during vitellogenesis...|$|R

This long-term prelabeling led to labeled <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> acylglycerols in which triacylglycerols comprised the main radioactive lipid component (95. 5 %), regardless of the radiolabeled compound used. Because the distribution of radioactivity among the lipid classes {{was very close to}} the mass distribution of the <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> lipid subspecies, it was concluded that homogeneous labeling of <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> lipids was obtained. After adipokinetic hormone treatment, an accumulation of radioactivity in the sn- 1, 2 -diacylglycerol fraction was the only significant change found in the distribution of radioactivity among <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> lipids.
