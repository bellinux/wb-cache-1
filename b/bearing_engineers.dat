40|$|AbstractThis article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} fundamentals of rolling element bearing designs and technologies. The aim is to outline the complex interrelation of all fundamentals with the rolling contact fatigue and the attainable bearing life. Such fundamentals include, amongst others, bearing stressing and life capability. The article shows {{the different types of}} rolling bearing stressing and the analysis of the stress distribution (principal stresses and equivalent stresses) in the material under the rolling contact area. It becomes obvious that the contamination of the bearing with foreign particles leads to a drastic reduction in bearing life. Furthermore, it demonstrates the impact of the bearing lubrication and coating as well as the effect of additives on the attainable life and wear. Further fundamentals of rolling element bearing design are the materials, the material cleanliness and the heat treatment. The article reveals the importance of the cleanliness of bearing steels as well as different types of inclusions and their effect on rolling contact fatigue. Additionally the article describes how to optimize the material properties (strength, toughness and residual stress) by the heat treatment processes. The outcome of these investigations is that endurance life of a rolling element bearing can be achieved if specific operating conditions, an adequate lubrication, good system cleanliness and specific bearing stressing are met. The article provides a guideline for <b>bearing</b> <b>engineers</b> on how designs and technologies can be applied to optimizing a bearing for a particular industry or aerospace application...|$|E

40|$|The {{inserted}} (I) {{domain of}} aLb 2 integrin (LFA- 1) contains the entire binding {{site of the}} molecule. It mediates both rolling and firm adhesion of leukocytes at sites of inflam-mation depending on the activation state of the integrin. The affinity change of the entire integrin can be mimicked by the I domain alone through mutations that affect the conformation of the molecule. High-affinity mutants of the I domain have been discovered previously using both ra-tional design and directed evolution. We have found that binding affinity fails to dictate the behavior of I domain ad-hesion under shear flow. In order to better understand I domain adhesion, we have developed a novel panning method to separate yeast expressing a library of I domain variants on the surface by adhesion under flow. Using con-ditions analogous to those experienced by cells interacting with the post-capillary vascular endothelium, we have identified mutations supporting firm adhesion that are not found using typical directed evolution techniques that select for tight binding to soluble ligands. Mutants isolated using this method do not cluster with those found by sorting with soluble ligand.

40|$|Abstract Background Lentiviral vectors {{with broad}} tropism {{are one of}} the most {{promising}} gene delivery systems capable of efficiently delivering genes of interest into both dividing and non-dividing cells while maintaining long-term transgene expression. However, there are needs for developing lentiviral vectors with the capability to deliver genes to specific cell types, thus reducing the "off-target" effect of gene therapy. In the present study, we investigated the possibility of engineering the fusion-active domain of a fusogenic molecule (FM) with the aim to improve targeted transduction of lentiviral vectors co-displaying an anti-CD 20 antibody (αCD 20) and a FM. Results Specific mutations were introduced into the fusion domain of a binding-deficient Sindbis virus glycoprotein to generate several mutant FMs. Lentiviral vectors incorporated with αCD 20 and one of the engineered FMs were successfully produced and demonstrated to be able to preferentially deliver genes to CD- 20 -expressing cells. Lentiviral vectors <b>bearing</b> <b>engineered</b> FMs exhibited 8 to 17 -fold enhanced transduction towards target cells as compared to the parental FM. Different levels of enhancement were observed for the different engineered FMs. A pH-dependent study of vector transduction showed that the broader pH range of the engineered FM is a possible mechanism for the resulted increase in transduction efficiency. Conclusion The fusion domain of Sindbis virus glycoprotein is amenable for engineering and the engineered proteins provide elevated capacity to mediate lentiviral vectors for targeted transduction. Our data suggests that application of such an engineering strategy can optimize the two-molecular targeting method of lentiviral vectors for gene delivery to predetermined cells. </p...|$|R

Under peak load conditions, such as driving slowly up a steep hill whilst heavily laden on a hot day, {{the thermostat}} will be approaching fully open because the engine will be producing near to maximum power while the velocity of air flow across the radiator is low.

Conversely, when cruising fast downhill on a motorway on a cold night on a light throttle, the thermostat will be nearly closed because the engine is producing little power, and the radiator is able to dissipate much more heat than the engine is producing. Allowing too much flow of coolant to the radiator would result in the engine being over cooled and operating at lower than optimum temperature, resulting in decreased fuel efficiency and increased exhaust emissions. Furthermore, engine durability, reliability, and longevity are sometimes compromised, if any components (such as the crankshaft <b>bearings)</b> are <b>engineered</b> to take thermal expansion into account to fit together with the correct clearances.

40|$|In the {{industrial}} context, {{the main goal}} of the maintenance team is to avoid sudden failures that can cause the stoppage of the system with a consequent loss of production. This means that each maintenance action must be performed before the degradation level of a system exceeds a critical threshold beyond which the failure probability becomes high. The increasing importance given to maintenance is shown {{not only by the}} great deal of literature on the topic, but also by the interest in transforming this area from a managerial area to a branch of applied mathematics (Operational Research or Statistics). Maintenance is now considered as a subject and much research activity is concerned with its mathematical modeling rather than with the management processes relating to maintenance itself. In [1], Scarf evidences the great importance of the mathematical modeling of maintenance and the correlated strategic support given by the maintenance management information systems. Nevertheless, no model can be built without an exhaustive collection of data. By data, Author means not only specific figures regarding, for example, failure times, but all information related to the process under study. With the recent advent of condition monitoring and the development of appropriate decision models, critical components of a system can be tracked through appropriate variable(s) correlated to their degradation process, logistic support (for example, spares inventory) can be provided, maintenance history can be stored, predetermined maintenance activity can be alarmed and management reports can be produced.

40|$|Large-diameter {{bored piles}} {{are a common}} type of {{foundations}} adopted in Hong Kong. As bored piles are constructed underground, visual examinations of potential pile defects are not feasible. Thus, quality assurance measures such as integrity tests and static loading tests {{play an important role}} to ensure the construction workmanship and quality. According to results from quality assurance tests, pile imperfections, especially at the pile toe, are not uncommon. As large-diameter bored piles are usually designed as end <b>bearing</b> piles, <b>engineers</b> concern much about how toe defects affect the pile performance. This thesis aims to investigate the occurrence of pile defects and the effect of pile defects on the behavior of large diameter bored piles. The construction and quality assurance of large diameter bored piles in Hong Kong were first reviewed. Survey studies on the causes and occurrence rates of pile defects were then carried out. Lastly, five centrifuge model tests and corresponding numerical simulations were carried out to study the effect of pile defects on the performance of pile foundations. In the survey study, a questionnaire survey on quality assurance measures and occurrences of potential pile defects was conducted. Besides, several case studies in Hong Kong on potential defects such as toe debris and cracks were carried out. About 86 % of the pile toes in the investigated projects are found intact. Moreover, the occurrence rate of toe debris has been decreased gradually with time {{as a result of the}} extra attention paid to the construction workmanship and advances in construction techniques. In the centrifuge modeling, two series of static loading tests were performed to simulate large-diameter bored piles 2 m in diameter. The first series of tests included two tests on single piles while the second series of tests included three tests on pile groups. Excessive settlement was measured from the defective single pile and there was a 30 % reduction in its ultimate capacity. In the pile groups with defective piles, the applied load was largely taken by piles without defects. The reductions in the ultimate capacities of the pile group with soft toes and the pile group with short piles were 14 % and 51 %, respectively. When the applied vertical load was large, lateral failure mechanisms could also be induced even if the applied vertical load was concentric.

Bridge bearings are small integral parts of the entire bridge structure serving several purposes, such as connection, transfer of forces, allowing movements, force damping etc. However, bridge bearings could create more problems for the bridge structure than it solves if not properly understood, especially when it receives less attention than it deserves. Technical and practical issues, such as selection of the right bearing type for use, merits and demerits of different bearing types, maintenance and monitoring, replacement, life cycle cost etc. are all imperative to ensure that bearings satisfy their purpose.   This study takes into consideration the practical and theoretical experience available for the use of bridge bearings. Two electronic surveys were used to garner knowledge and expertise from bridge <b>engineers,</b> <b>bearing</b> manufacturers and other stake holders in the course of this study, also practical knowledge concerning various types and problems of bridge bearings, maintenance, repair and replacement, life cycle costing etc. were employed in addition to physical investigation of bridge bearings in the Stockholm area of Sweden.   Generally, all bearing types were found to perform their functions satisfactorily when in good conditions, though inevitable problem of degradation reduces the life span of these bearings, especially the ones made mainly of steel being affected by corrosion.

40|$|Murine leukemia virus ecotropic and amphotropic {{envelope}} {{expression vectors}} were genetically engineered to generate truncations of the p 15 E TM cytoplasmic tail. The ecotropic construct CEET has the entire cytoplasmic tail of TM deleted, while the CEETR construct has only the R peptide {{portion of the}} tail deleted, thereby producing a TM subunit (p 12 E) that {{is identical to the}} one found in mature virions. The analogous amphotropic constructs were called CAET and CAETR. These envelopes, as opposed to their p 15 E TM counterparts, mediate cell-to-cell fusion at neutral pH in both transformed and nontransformed cell lines. Though the TM cytoplasmic domain is not required, its presence appears to augment such cell-to-cell fusion. This envelope-dependent fusion requires the presence of the viral receptor on the cell surface. Ecotropic virions bearing the p 12 E TM contain wild-type levels of the envelope complex and have near-normal titers. In contrast, virions which lack the cytoplasmic domain of TM (e. g., CEET) have 10 - to 100 -fold-lower titers but contain normal amounts of envelope. Both of the corresponding amphotropic virions contain normal amounts of envelope but have 10 - to 100 -fold-lower titers. Using immunofluorescent detection of envelope to monitor the fate of receptor-bound virions, we found that ecotropic murine leukemia virus envelope disappears from the cell surface while amphotropic envelope persists on the cell surface after virus binding. This pattern of immunofluorescence is consistent with the proposed routes of cell entry for these viruses, i. e., by endocytosis and direct fusion, respectively. In this assay, ecotropic virions <b>bearing</b> the genetically <b>engineered</b> p 12 E TM also appear to be internalized despite the ability of their envelope to mediate fusion at neutral pH in the same target cells.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} fundamental tribology of microfabricated rolling bearings for future micro-machines. It is hypothesized that adhesion, rather than elastic hysteresis, dominates the rolling friction and wear for these systems, {{a feature that}} is unique to the micro-scale. To test this hypothesis, specific studies in contact area and surface energy have been performed. Silicon microturbines supported on thrust bearings packed with 285 µm and 500 µm diameter stainless steel balls have undergone spin-down friction testing over a load and speed range of 10 - 100 mN and 500 - 10, 000 rpm, respectively. A positive correlation between calculated contact area and measured friction torque was observed, supporting the adhesion-dominated hysteresis hypothesis. Vapor phase lubrication has been integrated within the microturbine testing scheme in a controlled and characterized manner. Vapor-phase molecules allowed for specifically addressing adhesive energy without changing other system properties. A 61 % reduction of friction torque was observed with the utilization of 18 % relative humidity water vapor lubrication. Additionally, the relationship between friction torque and normal load was shown to follow an adhesion-based trend, highlighting the effect of adhesion and further confirming the adhesion-dominant hypothesis. The wear mechanisms have been studied for a microfabricated ball bearing platform that includes silicon and thin-film coated silicon raceway/steel ball materials systems. Adhesion of ball material, {{found to be the}} primary wear mechanism, is universally present in all tested materials systems. Volumetric adhesive wear rates are observed between 4 x 10 ^- 4 µm^ 3 /mN*rev and 4 x 10 ^- 5 µm 3 /mN*rev were determined by surface mapping techniques and suggest a self-limiting process. This work also demonstrates the utilization of an Off-The-Shelf (OTS) MEMS accelerometer to confirm a hypothesized ball bearing instability regime which encouraged the design of new bearing geometries, as well as to perform in situ diagnostics of a high-performance rotary MEMS device. Finally, the development of a 3 D fabrication technique with the potential of significantly improving the performance of micro-scale rotary structures is described. The process was used to create uniform, smooth, curved surfaces. Micro-scale ball bearings are then able to be utilized in high-speed regimes where load can be accommodated both axially and radially, allowing for new, high-speed applications. A comprehensive exploration of the fundamental tribology of microball bearing MEMS has been performed, including specific experiments on friction, wear, lubrication, dynamics, and geometrical optimization.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is two-fold: First, to present an {{adequate}} treatment of secondary stresses, and second, to introduce-three new methods evolved by the writer. During recent years when the importance of secondary stresses has exhibited itself a large amount of literature has been written on the subject for advancing the science of structural design* 2 ̆ 6 critical study made of these papers will at once reveal that they are subject to one or more defects which greatly impair their practical value. In the first place, too much attention has been paid to the mathematical theories, which could be greatly shortened for the benefit of practical engineers. Secondly, the treatment of the subject is generally limited to a narrow field, in which only a few methods are applied to only a certain class of structure. Thirdly, the treatment of the four existing methods is entirely too individual, in that the methods are generally considered as being separate from each other^notwithstanding the fact that they are more or less equivalent. Lastly, but not the least, the effect of secondary stresses on the design is not adequately considered and sometimes sadly neglected. With a view to avoid the above defects it has been the writer 2 ̆ 7 s endeavor that the subject be treated in an entirely different way——that it be more practical, more comprehensive, and more logical; so that it could be easily understood and appreciated by those for whom the secondary stress has the most direct <b>bearing</b> the practical <b>engineers.</b> The writer is aware that not all of these objects are attained in this paper, on account of limited amount of time, but it is believed that the- scope of the work and the arrangement of materials are sufficiently effective so as to produce the desired results, The methods for computing secondary stresses have been greatly improved in recent years. Two objections, however, still stand in the ways First, the amount of time involved is often excessive-, and second, the lack of a checking device by which the correctness of the various steps of procedure may be ensured. While there are numerous other defects these two alone are generally sufficient to reduce their practical utility. Ever since the beginning of 1917, when the writer undertook the analysis of secondary stresses in a two hinged arch, the results of which have been published in the Transactions of American Society of Civil Engineers, Vol. 82, p. 1104, it always occurred to him that there must be some method which is not only shorter and less cumbersome than the current ones but which also admits of a unique check. For two a and half years he has worked on the subject almost incessantly, striving to find some new method that will accomplish both. At last, much to his satisfaction, the graphic method of deformation contour was obtained; which not only takes less time, furnishes unique check, but also gives remarkably accurate results. Along with this method, almost contemporaneously, two more methods were evolved— the graphic method of successive deduction and the analytic solution of the graphic methods. All of the three methods are described in detail in Part III, page 2 ̆ 738, which,being treated more or less independently, could be read without reference to other parts of the paper. A perusal of Chapter 10, page 105, is hereby recommended. As these methods are new in their field it is hoped that their usefulness be actually tested by further investigators. Besides the two purposed of the paper as heretofore mentioned the following points deserve special attention: (1) The method for the solution of simultaneous equations, p. 25. (2) The approximate methods in Chapters 2 and 3, pages 115 - 125. (3) The well digested principles of design in Chapters 1 to 6, pages 140 - 151...|$|R
