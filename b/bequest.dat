5|$|The Gallery’s lack {{of space}} {{remained}} acute in this period. In 1845 a large <b>bequest</b> of British paintings {{was made by}} Robert Vernon; there was insufficient room in the Wilkins building so these were displayed first in Vernon’s town house at No. 50 Pall Mall and then at Marlborough House. The Gallery was even less well equipped for its next major <b>bequest,</b> as J. M. W. Turner was to bequeath the entire contents of his studio, excepting unfinished works, to the nation upon his death in 1851. The first 20 of these were displayed off-site in Marlborough House in 1856. Ralph Nicholson Wornum the Gallery's Keeper and Secretary, worked with John Ruskin to bring the <b>bequest</b> together. The stipulation in Turner's will that two of his paintings be displayed alongside works by Claude is still honoured in Room 15 of the Gallery, but his <b>bequest</b> has never been adequately displayed in its entirety; today the works are divided between Trafalgar Square and the Clore Gallery, a small purpose-built extension to the Tate completed in 1985.|$|E

The probate {{value of the}} Tapling Collection was set at £12,000 but on arrival Richard Garnett (Assistant Keeper of Printed Books) estimated their value at more than £50,000 and described the <b>bequest</b> as the most valuable gift since the Grenville Library in 1847.|$|E

5|$|Lacking that guidance, discussions {{began on}} how the <b>bequest</b> money should be spent. The City Lands Committee {{suggested}} in a report that the <b>bequest</b> should be spent on educating {{a larger number of}} boys and this approach was adopted in 1826. A number of people including Richard Taylor, a printer and an assistant to the founding of University College London, urged the Corporation of London to spend the <b>bequest</b> on creating a day school for the largest possible number of boys. In 1830, they proposed that the City of London Corporation School be founded with Taylor as a governor, and that the school to be established {{on the site of the}} disused London Workhouse. In the mean time, a small number of boys, who became known as Carpenter's scholars, were sent to Tonbridge School. In 1829, an Act of Parliament was passed to transform the workhouse into a school and governors were appointed. Conditions at the workhouse site had deteriorated and much money was needed for its maintenance. The only funds available, though, were the same £300 (about £22,000 in 2008) a year budget the workhouse had received.|$|E

5|$|William Bryan and {{his wife}} donated land and built a school at nearby Glenore in 1862. The Bryans left a <b>bequest</b> that fully funded the school until 1914, when the state's {{education}} department assumed responsibility for {{the building and the}} teacher's salary. By 1921 56 students were attending. The building had been condemned by 1926 and a new brick school building was built a short distance away. Following a direction by Mrs Bryan in her <b>bequest,</b> the school was used at times for religious services, by Methodists and Anglicans. Due to low attendance the school was closed in 1941 and the few remaining pupils continued schooling at Whitemore.|$|E
40|$|Transfers in {{the form}} of <b>bequests</b> have {{important}} implications for the intergenerational transmission of inequality. Demographic change has relevant consequences for the timing and size of <b>bequests.</b> For example, longer life implies that people receive <b>bequests</b> when they are older. Conversely, increasing generational length reduces the average age at which people are given <b>bequests.</b> We analyze the consequences of demographic change in the United States for the timing over the life course when individuals receive an inheritance and for the size of <b>bequests.</b> We evaluate trends in life expectancy at the mean age at childbearing as a proxy for timing at receipt of <b>bequests.</b> We complement formal demographic analysis with empirical estimates from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) inheritance data for 1987 - 2010. We find that the long-term trend of increasing age at receipt of <b>bequests</b> and of increasing size of per-capita <b>bequests</b> received might have stalled, mainly because of changes in the timing of fertility. In the long term, the upward trend in age at which people receive <b>bequests</b> may resume as the expected linear gains in life expectancy would more than counteract recent increases in the mean age at childbearing. We showed that demographic change affects the size of <b>bequests</b> and the timing over the life course at which people receive them. As the need for economic resources varies over the life cycle, changes in the timing at receipt of <b>bequests</b> may have a differential impact on wealth inequality and affect patterns of multigenerational transfers of resources...|$|R
40|$|Actual inheritances are {{a hybrid}} of {{canonical}} types of <b>bequests</b> and, in particular, of accidental <b>bequests</b> and altruistic <b>bequests.</b> In this paper, a bequeathed estate consists of two components: an amount intended by altruistic parents and an amount which results from the “premature” death of parents. Altruistic parents can also invest in their children's education. Taxing those two types of <b>bequests</b> separately {{is known to have}} different implications.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>bequests</b> and of taxation on <b>bequests</b> for the distribution of wealth. We investigate a model with overlapping generations and heterogenous households where parents derive utility directly from their <b>bequests.</b> Using the coefficient of variation as measure of equality, <b>bequests</b> per se diminish the inequality of wealth since they raise private savings and hence average wealth holdings more than the dispersion of wealth. From a policy perspective, taxing <b>bequests</b> and redistributing government revenue lump-sum among the young generation further decreases wealth inequality. These results also hold when measuring inequality by the Gini coefficient. [...] bequest,taxation,wealth inequality,OLG model,analytical solution...|$|R

5|$|The {{directorship}} of Neil MacGregor saw a major rehang at the Gallery, {{dispensing with}} {{the classification of}} paintings by national school that had been introduced by Eastlake. The new chronological hang sought to emphasise the interaction between cultures rather than fixed national characteristics, reflecting the change in art historical values since the 19th century. In other respects, however, Victorian tastes were rehabilitated: the building's interiors were no longer considered an embarrassment and were restored, and in 1999 the Gallery accepted a <b>bequest</b> of 26 Italian Baroque paintings from Sir Denis Mahon. Earlier in the 20th century many considered the Baroque to be beyond the pale: in 1945 the Gallery's trustees declined to buy a Guercino from Mahon's collection for £200. The same painting was valued at £4million in 2003. Mahon's <b>bequest</b> was made {{on the condition that}} the Gallery would never deaccession any of its paintings or charge for admission.|$|E

The same is true for the amount of <b>bequests,</b> but not for the amount of gifts.

40|$|Much of the {{literature}} on the effects of estate taxation on charitable <b>bequests</b> has relied on cross sectional data, reflecting the uniqueness of death. Few have explored longitudinal data to exploit exogenous variations in tax regimes.

This paper explores the effects of the estate tax on charitable <b>bequests</b> using administrative data from two tax regimes where earlier biases are minimized. The deductibility of charitable <b>bequests</b> is found to have significant implications for giving. However, the effects of estate tax repeal are much smaller.

40|$|Taxpayers are {{considerably}} interested in tax planning for intergenerational transfers (inter vivos gifts and <b>bequests)</b> that minimize {{the payment of}} taxes. Nordblom and Ohlsson (2006) demonstrated that (1) altruistic parents avoid tax payment by changing the timing of transfers when inter vivos gifts are taxed differently from <b>bequests</b> and (2) tax avoidance ceases to exist if <b>bequests</b> and gifts from the same donor are jointly taxed. This paper aims to demonstrate that if the wealth management/investment behavior of the parent is taken into consideration, tax avoidance will persist even when gifts and <b>bequests</b> are jointly taxed. This is because parents dislike missing an opportunity to gain investment returns from the payment of taxes on gifts that exceed the exemption level.
