40|$|The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System is {{the space}} lidar on the NASA ICESat mission. Its design {{combines}} an altimeter with 5 cm precision with a laser pointing angle determination {{system and a}} dual wavelength cloud and aerosol lidar. GLAS measures the range to the Earth s surface with 1064 nm laser pulses. Each laser pulse produces a precision pointing measurement from the stellar reference system (SRS) and an echo pulse waveform, which permits range determination and waveform spreading analysis. The single shot ranging accuracy is < 10 cm for ice surfaces with slopes < 2 degrees. GLAS also measures atmospheric backscatter profiles at both 1064 and 532 nm. The 1064 nm measurements use an analog Si APD detector and measure the height and profile the backscatter signal from thicker clouds. The measurements at 532 nm use photon counting detectors, and will measure the vertical height distributions of optically thin clouds and aerosol layers Before launch, the measurement performance of GLAS was evaluated using a lidar test instrument called the <b>Bench</b> <b>Check</b> Equipment (BCE). The BCE was developed in parallel with GLAS and served as an inverse altimeter, inverse lidar and a stellar source simulator. It was used to simulate the range of expected optical inputs to the GLAS receiver by illuminating its telescope with simulated background light as well as laser echoes with known powers, energy levels, widths and delay times. The BCE also allowed monitoring of the transmitted laser energy, the angle measurements of the SRS, the co-alignment of the transmitted laser beam to the receiver line of sight, and performance of the flight science algorithms. Performance was evaluated during the GLAS development, before and after environmental tests, and after delivery to the spacecraft. The ICESat observatory was launched into a 94 degree inclination, 590 km altitude circular polar orbit on January 12, 2003. Beginning in early February, GLAS was powered on tested in stages. Its 1064 nm optical receiver was evaluated in a several tests using both solar background light and an internal test source. Laser 1 was activated on February 20, 2003. GLAS operated with Laser 1 for 38 continuous days on orbit using its 1064 nm receiver channel, producing over 130 million individual laser measurements of the Earth s surface and atmosphere. These nadir-pointed measurements fell along the ICESat s ground track, and spanned more than 4 cycles of the initial 8 -day ICESat repeat orbit. The initial GLAS measurement set shows strong echo pulses from ranging to the surface topography, oceans, ice sheets and cloud tops, as well as profiles of clouds and aerosols. The GLAS measurements have unprecedented vertical and angular resolution, and show nearly continuous height profiles of ice, land and ocean surfaces or cloud tops, as well profiles of backscatter from thin clouds and aerosol layers. Examples of these GLAS measurements and an initial assessment of its science measurement performance will be presented...|$|E

In detail two philosophies were discovered in case of using end of line test <b>benches</b> to <b>check</b> all functionalities of an electric motor after all assembly steps. The comparison is a practical approach and involves three parts to investigate on the passive end of line test bench as a sufficient method to detect all critical faults and the performance of PMSMs...|$|R
5000|$|Due {{to having}} {{support his family}} at an early age, Tony only had a fifth-grade education. According to one story, Tony was always paid in cash, a common {{occurrence}} for other players of the day. One day, several Maroons players found some money on the bench that belonged to Tony. They asked him, [...] "What are you doing, Tony? Why don't you get yourself a checking account?" [...] Tony didn't understand how a checking account worked and didn't want to get one. But because the other players kept bugging him about it, he eventually gave in and got one. However a week later, the same players found his checkbook lying on the <b>bench,</b> with every <b>check</b> in the book was signed. He'd typically walk into a business and ask the clerk, [...] "What do I owe you?" [...] He would then proceed {{to fill in the}} amount on the check because his name was already on it.|$|R
40|$|A systemâ€™s {{efficiency}} is always {{determined by the}} performance like how the system responses to an input and what / when /where the expected output is obtained, As performance and functionality {{are the most important}} features in a web application. Due to lack of multi-directional analysis, most of the software's are not exceeding the bench mark of perfection both in case of performance and also functionality. So this paper gives a framework, Writing Automation rules to check the functionality, fixing the <b>bench</b> mark and <b>checking</b> the performance of the application and creating statistical reports based on the bench marks is the core prototype of this paper. In our paper we create a web application to check the functionality using a technology Quick Test Professional (QTP). So manual flaws can be easily avoided. Then the load test is checked using Loader Runner. Using this load test technology, the application is simulated with multiple users and checked for the performance of the application in terms of different stress levels(hits/s, response time, throughput, errors/s). Added to that, this paper is extended to check the threshold of the system, how much amount of consumption of energy in system for the particular running application. A detailed report will be provided on functionality and stable performance (average response time) of the web applications.

40|$|Weed {{management}} {{is one of}} the tedious operations in crop production. Because of labor costs, time and fully manual weeding is unfavorable. Hence effort is made to design and develop efficient Farm equipment to perform weeding without using electric power. This paper presents modeling, simulation, analysis, fabrication and testing of low cost three row weeder. The conception and key characteristics of simulation based design and the advantage of using it to design the driving mechanism of three row weeding equipment were discussed. The structure and mechanical parts of weeder were designed using CATIA with detail, including its three-dimensional modeling, assembly, interference checking, kinematics simulation, and two-dimensional engineering-drawing conversion etc. Later 3 -D cad model is saved as (. stp) format and imported in ANSYS work <b>bench</b> environment and <b>checked</b> for Multibody dynamics simulation and Finite element analysis is done for safe design. The result shows that simulation based design technology can shorten the design & development period and reduce design cost [...] The machine would be very useful for poor farmers. The cost of the commercial model of the equipment was estimated at Rs 6500 /-. The functional efficiency result of the manually operated weeder cum feeder on loamy soil was 81. 4 %, clay soil was 86. 5 % and sandy soil was 89. 4 % on of these soils. The overall machine field efficiency was 88. 82 %...|$|R
