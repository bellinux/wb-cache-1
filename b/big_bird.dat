5|$|After {{an absence}} of ten years, and almost 30 years after the 1983 movie <b>Big</b> <b>Bird</b> in China, 53 eleven-minute episodes of Sesame Street's <b>Big</b> <b>Bird</b> Looks at the World, filmed in Mandarin Chinese, debuted in early 2011 in China. Inspired by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, the program {{emphasized}} emergency preparedness. In {{the first week of}} December 2011, a Pashto and Dari-language version called Baghch-e-Simsim was launched in Afghanistan, and in the same month Pakistan began airing its own Urdu-language version, called SimSim Humara, which was supposed to run for three years. In June 2012, the United States terminated funding for SimSim Humara due to serious allegations of corruption by the local Pakistani puppet theater working on the initiative.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the show}} was set aside {{for a series of}} funny, colorful, puppet {{characters}} living on the titular street. These included Grover, Bert and Ernie, Cookie Monster, Elmo, Oscar the Grouch, and <b>Big</b> <b>Bird.</b> Henson performed the characters of Ernie, game-show host Guy Smiley, and Kermit, who appeared as a roving television news reporter. It was around this time that a frill was added around Kermit's neck to make him more frog-like. The collar was functional as well: it covered the joint where the Muppet's neck and body met.|$|E
5|$|Jim Henson {{originally}} {{conceived of}} his Muppets as characters aimed at an adult audience. He {{was disappointed that}} {{the popularity of the}} characters that appeared in Sesame Street, including <b>Big</b> <b>Bird</b> and Bert and Ernie, had solidified a public perception his Muppets were solely intended for educating children. Henson worried he would be stuck forever working on children's television series. He felt his Muppet characters should be able to be appreciated by individuals of any maturity level. Henson told The Saturday Evening Post he had constantly dealt with others looking down upon the idea of puppet performers. He envied ventriloquist Edgar Bergen for his ability to appeal to a mature audience. Henson said he wanted to work on a program that was broadcast during the peak adult-viewing time and said he had prior difficulty persuading the major television networks to create a puppet program for mature audiences.|$|E

500|$|Two {{segments}} later, <b>Big</b> <b>Bird</b> interrupts the adults—Maria (Sonia Manzano), David (Northern Calloway), Bob (Bob McGrath), Susan (Loretta Long), Gordon, Luis (Emilio Delgado) and Olivia (Alaina Reed Hall)—discussing {{politics by}} giving them pictures he had drawn of each of them. He gets to Mr. Hooper's picture, saying that he would {{give it to him}} when he returns. The adults tearfully and emotionally explain to <b>Big</b> <b>Bird</b> that Mr. Hooper has died and he will never come back. <b>Big</b> <b>Bird</b> reacts by getting upset, expressing his confusion and sadness. The adults reassure him that they love him and will take care of him and David reveals that he would take over the store, Mr. Hooper having left it to him in his will. <b>Big</b> <b>Bird</b> asks, [...] "Why {{does it have to be}} this way? Give me one good reason!" [...] and Gordon answers, [...] "Big Bird, it has to be this way... just because." [...] Looking at Mr. Hooper's picture, <b>Big</b> <b>Bird</b> says, mispronouncing his name as he had done many times in the past, [...] "I'm going to miss you, Mr. Looper."

The episode begins with a scene between Gordon (Roscoe Orman) and the Muppet Forgetful Jones (Richard Hunt). Gordon helps Forgetful remember something that had made him happy; as Davis states, [...] "Later, <b>Big</b> <b>Bird</b> forgets something that makes him sad". After several inserts, <b>Big</b> <b>Bird</b> walks backward with his head between his legs; when Gordon asks him why, he answers, [...] "Just because".

500|$|Davis {{described}} Mr. Hooper as [...] "slightly cranky but good-hearted". [...] Gikow called Mr. Hooper [...] "curmudgeonly".

[...] Davis also stated that Hooper's Store, which he called [...] "an idealized social institution", is an extension of Mr. Hooper's personality. [...] Mr. Hooper has a special relationship with the Muppet character <b>Big</b> <b>Bird,</b> who would often come into Hooper's Store for a birdseed milkshake and a chat. A running gag in the show was that <b>Big</b> <b>Bird</b> would often mispronounce Mr. Hooper's name, although most attempts ended in [...] "ooper," [...] such as [...] "Looper" [...] or [...] "Cooper". [...] Mr. Hooper's first name, Harold, was not revealed until the character earned a GED during night school.|$|E
500|$|Sesame Street head writer Norman Stiles {{was chosen}} to write the {{segments}} about Mr. Hooper's death. [...] The episode focused on {{the life cycle of}} birth and death by also mentioning the birth of a baby, and by remembering Mr. Hooper. [...] Stiles said, [...] "We decided to say that while Mr. Hooper was not here anymore, we will always have that part of him that lives within the heart, that we have our love and that it will always stay". [...] Stiles wanted to convey that expressing grief for someone who had died was difficult for both adults and children. [...] Instead of providing an explanation, the adults of Sesame Street tell Mr. Hooper's friend <b>Big</b> <b>Bird,</b> when he asked why Mr. Hooper had died, that there was no real reason, that it happened, as Gordon tells <b>Big</b> <b>Bird,</b> [...] "Just because". [...] The show's outside experts advised Stiles and the producers to remove the line because they were concerned that an open-ended explanation would not be enough for children, but Stiles kept the line because it was an acknowledgement, as Gikow stated, that there is never a good explanation about why people die.|$|E
