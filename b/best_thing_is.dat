500|$|Chuck Taylor of Billboard gave a {{positive}} review, {{stating that the}} song is of [...] "equal caliber to its predecessor , with a one-listen hook, elegant chug-along melody, a lyric about healing and Lewis' unquestionably emotive vocal versatility". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe called it a [...] "love takes time' rumination", and along with another song of the album ("I Will Be"), described it as [...] "predictable". Sean Fennessey for Vibe noted that the track [...] "is the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> , <b>is</b> mannered and takes nearly three minutes {{to get off the}} ground". It ranked at number four on the [...] "10 Best Singles of 2008" [...] list by American magazine Entertainment Weekly. [...] "Better in Time" [...] was nominated at the 2009 BRIT Awards in the category of Best British Single, and later the song was included on the awards' compilation album.|$|E
500|$|Deprived of the suitors' patronage, Iro {{commits suicide}} after a doleful {{monologue}} ("O grief, O torment that saddens the soul!") Melanto, whose lover Eurimaco was killed with the suitors, tries to warn Penelope {{of the new}} danger represented by the unidentified slayer, but Penelope is unmoved and continues to mourn for Ulisse. Eumete and Telemaco now inform her that the beggar was Ulisse in disguise, but she refuses to believe them: [...] "Your news is persistent and your comfort hurtful." [...] The scene briefly transfers to the heavens, where Giunone, having been solicited by Minerva, persuades Giove and Nettune that Ulisse should be restored to his throne. Back in the palace the nurse Ericlea has discovered Ulisse's identity by recognising a scar on his back, but does not immediately reveal this information: [...] "Sometimes the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> a wise silence." [...] Penelope continues to disbelieve, even when Ulisse appears in his true form and when Ericlea reveals her knowledge of the scar. Finally, after Ulisse describes the pattern of Penelope's private bedlinen, knowledge that only he could possess, she is convinced. Reunited, the pair sing rapturously to celebrate their love: [...] "My sun, long sighed for! My light, renewed!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Suggestions were made, despite initial {{skepticism}} on {{the part}} of the composer, that Boito would be interested in creating a new libretto based upon the play. Within several days, Ricordi approached Verdi with the request that he would like to visit Sant' Agata [...] "with a friend" [...] in September. Verdi's reaction was clearly non-committal: [...] "I wish absolutely to avoid committing myself [...] The <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> ... <b>is</b> for him to send me the finished poem".|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{sure he was}} right!" [...] said Ethel earnestly. [...] "Then {{you don't}} think the dream meant being beaten, only that our <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> not gained by successes in this world?" ...|$|R
60|$|I. For {{the first}} of these, that the <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> yet behind, and in {{reversion}} for believers; this is manifest by the natural exercise of this grace. For 'hope that is seen, is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it' (Rom 8:24,25). Hope lives not by sight, as faith doth; but hope trusteth faith, as faith trusts the Word, and so bears up the soul in a patient expectation at last to enjoy what God has promised. But I say, the very natural work of this grace proveth, that the believer's <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> behind in reversion.|$|R
60|$|He {{thought of}} the moody, well-dressed young man, {{with whom he had}} {{exchanged}} glances in the crowd around the bandstand, and who, he felt confident, was the robber. Would he recognize him again? Doubtless. But he did not want ever to see him again. The <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> to forget this humiliating episode.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so," [...] said Lingard, gravely. [...] "That was {{the thing}} to do, of course. If you can't fight a man the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to exasperate him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go on," [...] {{said the}} bishop, {{holding on to}} that promise of comfort. [...] "The <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to thrash out the case in your own way. And then come to what is practical." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you find}} {{yourself}} going, Jack," [...] Hawtry said, [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to catch hold of his ears. Come on, let's get out of this. All the village is staring at us." ...|$|E
60|$|A. Their {{power of}} SELECTION relates to things {{of which the}} supply is limited (as the supply of <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>is</b> always). When it becomes matter of {{question}} to whom such <b>things</b> <b>are</b> to belong, the richest person has necessarily the first choice, unless some arbitrary mode of distribution be otherwise determined upon. The business of the economist is to show how this choice may be a Wise one.|$|R
50|$|The Tsesarevich could {{refer to}} these results as {{confirmation}} of the views he had expressed during the Franco-Prussian War; he concluded that for Russia, the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> to recover {{as quickly as possible}} from her temporary exhaustion, and prepare for future contingencies by military and naval reorganization. In accordance with this conviction, he suggested that certain reforms should be introduced.|$|R

6000|$|... "So {{we are not}} to see {{the captain}} again," [...] he said presently. [...] "But I suppose that when a man has a thing to do, the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to go and do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] he {{continued}} {{after a short}} pause, [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> [...] . the best for us [...] . for every one. [...] .

6000|$|Mr. Burton {{shook his}} head. [...] "No, she might find out," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "I {{think that the}} <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> {{for you to go}} home after dinner, Joe, and just give ’er a look in on the way, p’r’aps. You could say a lot o’ things about me in ’arf an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|Would I could cast a sail on {{the water}} [...] Where many a king has gone [...] And many a king's daughter, [...] And alight at the comely trees and the lawn, [...] The playing upon pipes and the dancing, [...] And learn that the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> [...] To change my loves while dancing [...] And pay but a kiss for a kiss.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not; only I {{think you}} have no right to ask. We both think that in {{marriage}} each should leave the other perfect freedom. I used to imagine the ideal was that married folk should not have a thought, nor an idea apart; but that is all rot. The <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> evidently for each to go his own way, and respect the privacy of the other. Complete trust entails complete liberty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not sure}} if the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> wouldn't <b>be</b> to cut the loss. I've been paying out {{about as much as}} I want to in differences." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{spite of}} his hapless fate, Sverker II {{receives}} several kind words in the short chronicle included in the Law of Västergötland: [...] "The sixteenth ruler was King Sverker, a wise and good fellow; the kingdom fared well from him. But the Folkungs took his life; his own brother-in-law did that to him at Gestilren. He rests in Alvastra, and the <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> always spoken about him".|$|R
6000|$|... 'For my part,' said Buckhurst, 'whenever a {{political}} system is breaking up, as in this country at present, I think the very <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to brush all the old Dons off the stage. They never take to the new road kindly. They are always hampered by their exploded prejudices and obsolete traditions. I don't think a single man, Vere, that sat in the Venetian Senate ought {{to be allowed to}} sit in the present English House of Commons.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to {{interfere}} with any of your arrangements," [...] said the Princess, [...] "but as soon as I heard the terms of my father's will, I {{made up my mind}} to marry the victor in the contest. As I cannot inherit the throne myself, the next <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to be the wife of the man who does. Go forth, then, and find your antagonist, and when you have conquered him, I will marry you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Time will go fast with you, Mr. Jack Maldon,' {{pursued the}} Doctor, 'and fast {{with all of}} us. Some of us can hardly expect, perhaps, in the natural course of things, to greet you on your return. The next <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to hope to do it, and that's my case. I shall not weary you with good advice. You have long had a good model before you, in your cousin Annie. Imitate her virtues as nearly as you can.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Shimabukuro commented afterwards: [...] "The <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> that, {{even with}} all those people, we {{recorded}} everything live with no overdubs. It was great, tracking live with an orchestra and a rhythm section. We picked up on each other’s subtle emotional cues - you could feel everyone breathing together. It was {{like the old days}} of recording - when everyone tracked together - there’s a certain magic that happens." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Payment for a kindness?” Clay suggested. “Well, I {{suppose the}} <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> given for nothing and can’t be bought, {{but that has}} not been my luck. What I couldn’t take by force I’ve had to pay for at full market price. The love of a bargain is in my blood. Pull my son through, and {{whatever}} I can do for you won’t make me less your debtor.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It was {{the most}} crying scandal of the Pacific," [...] exclaimed Davidson vehemently. [...] "The missionaries had been {{agitating}} against it for years, and at last the local press took it up. The police refused to stir. You know their argument. They say that vice is inevitable and consequently the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to localise and control it. The truth is, they were paid. Paid. They were paid by the saloon-keepers, paid by the bullies, paid by the women themselves. At last {{they were forced to}} move." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> for {{everyone}} to lie down for a few hours," [...] the Major said. [...] "No one had a wink of sleep last night, {{and most of us}} have not slept much for some nights past. We must always keep two men on the roof, to be relieved every two hours. I will draw up a regular rota for duty; but except those two, the rest had better take a good sleep. We may be all called upon to be under arms at night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to {{suck the}} wound instantly, {{to take out}} a knife and cut deeply in, and then, as we have no vesuvians, I should break up half a dozen pistol cartridges, put the powder into and on the wound, and set it alight. I believe that that is what they do in some parts of Eastern Europe {{in the case of the}} bites of mad dogs; and this, if no time is lost after the bite is given, is almost always effectual in keeping off hydrophobia." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "One of the <b>best</b> <b>things</b> ... <b>is</b> Jutson’s {{depiction}} {{and use of}} Paxton and his psychic abilities. Neither contrived nor clichéd, Paxton is {{a fascinating}} and reasonably complex character - not a cardboard cutout of the average “psychic” tabloid columnist or wannabe TV celebrity... Topped off nicely by moments of humour and domesticity that provide a breather from the dark deeds, it’s an enjoyable local read for crime fiction fans."

"He had," [...] he said, when he {{recovered}} consciousness, [...] "heard a tremendous fire going on, {{and as soon}} as he could collect his thoughts became assured that the enemy must be attacking the village. He therefore concluded that the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> to lie still, which he did until the fire ceased and he could hear the Prussians retreating. Then he had crawled in until close to the line of outposts." ...|$|R
60|$|His {{heart was}} so full of sorrow that his {{greatest}} desire was to go where those who might believe he had been a partner of the burglars could not see him; but since that was impossible, if he intended to obey the deacon's injunctions and present himself at the grand stand at the specified time, the next <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> to remain behind the booth where his mother tried her best to cheer him.|$|R
