O uso de drogas, tal qual a adicção não decorre exclusivamente da relação indivíduo-substância, existem muitos outros fatores relacionados. O consumo de drogas está intrinsecamente ligado à construção social e à ambientes que tornam a prática mais propícia. No caso de estudantes universitários a instalação e repetição do consumo de substâncias químicas podem ser resultantes da vida social intensa do referido grupo e da influência de colegas, haja vista que neste período o indivíduo está mais suscetível às novas experiências. Sabendo que o ingresso no mundo acadêmico constitui um período de grande vulnerabilidade para que adolescentes e jovens adultos iniciem o uso de drogas é necessário que sejam realizados levantamentos e estudos acerca de seu comportamento, envolvimento e relação com tais substâncias, com o intuito de coibir, prevenir e compreender a melhor maneira de precatar a prática. ABSTRACT: Chemical {{dependence}} is {{a problem}} with high social consequences and an impairment to public health. Similar to addiction, the use of illicit drugs is not an exclusive consequence of the subject-drug relationship since several other factors are related. Drugs are closely linked to social structures and to environments in which they <b>become</b> <b>propitious.</b> In the case of university students, the introduction and repetition of drug use may have been caused by the intense social life of the referred group and the influence of colleagues since during this period in life the subject is more prone to new experiences. Since the insertion into the university milieu is a period of deep vulnerability to the extent that adolescents and young adults start using drugs, surveys and in-depth studies must be undertaken on the behavior, involvement and relationship with these chemical substances to prevent the practice and understand the best way to shun the abuse.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} how monetary policy, restricted only by price stability, may easily <b>become</b> <b>propitious</b> {{to asset}} inflation and – eventually – to a financial crisis. This risk is particularly high when {{the financial system}} lacks proper regulation and effective supervision. Hasty liberalization, negligence of official oversight and „Greenspan doctrine” which refuted any activist policy promoting financial stability characterized Fed’s monetary policy under the former Fed’s governor. The paper also analyses {{another aspect of the}} linkages between monetary policy and financial crises – monetary policy reaction to financial crises. It is not surprising that it consists of cutting interest rates and bail-out of insolvent, systemically important financial institutions. Such policy, especially when run too long and changed too abruptly, not only creates moral hazards but it also sets the stage for another „search for yield” and build-up of another speculative bubble. As a result, monetary policy becomes asymmetric and pro-cyclical. Fed’s reaction to the recent crisis seems to be very much in line with this pattern typical of Fed’s policy in the past. However, this time the scale of flooding the economy with liquidity and – as a consequence – the risks of future major imbalances in the financial system are unprecedented. A general conclusion of the paper says that there can’t be a sound financial and economic system unless money itself is a scarce resource. However trivial this statement is, monetary policy of some central banks seems to miss the point...|$|E

40|$|Background: Yupkpa {{community}} in Perijá Sierra {{does not have}} drinking water or sewage elimination systems. Thus it <b>becomes</b> a <b>propitious</b> place for infection with intestinal parasites. Aim: To determine the prevalence of intestinal parasites in children, ages 0 to 14 years, in the Yukpa ethnic population of Toromo in the Perijá Mountains, Zulia State, Venezuela. Material and Methods: Ninety one fecal samples were analyzed by the following coproparasitologic methods: saline solution and lugol fresh mount, formalin-ether concentration (Ritchie), and Kinyoun stain for intestinal coccidians. Results: Overall parasite infection prevalence was 83. 5 %. The most frequently observed parasites were: Ascaris lumbricoides (57. 1 %), Trichuris trichiura (20. 8 %), Hymenolepis nana (14. 2 %), Blastocystis hominis (51. 6 %), Giardia lamblia (30. 7 %), and Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar complex (21. 9 %). Coccidians were nont observed {{in any of the}} stool samples. Conclusions: The large number of infected people {{is directly related to the}} hygienic and sanitary conditions of the population studie...|$|R
40|$|The {{challenge}} of isolating {{the impact of}} Europeanisation is an arduous one, which explains why analysts have preferred complex rather than parsimonious explanations of this phenomenon. Given this predilection among scholars, {{it is surprising that}} the concept of regime complexity has not been meaningfully applied in the Europeanisation literature. This article lays some initial groundwork for assessing whether regime complexity has weakened or reinforced the impact of Europeanisation, with reference specifically to French aid. France constitutes a ‘hard case’ in that it was the original architect behind the common European development policy and has retained the capacity to resist EU pressures on its bilateral aid. This article begins by highlighting the limited impact of Europeanisation on French assistance {{in the early decades of}} European integration. Next, it demonstrates how the climate <b>became</b> more <b>propitious</b> as from the late 1990 s following domestic reforms, increased EU pressures and the emergence of an aid regime complex. Drawing on elite interviews, it shows how France has become more receptive to Europeanisation, while also using regime complexity to reframe EU norms. Finally, it explains why and how France has resisted Europeanisation and explores the wider significance of the French case and of regime complexity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Anatase nano {{titanium}} oxide was synthesized with Ti(SO 4) 2 as titanium source and stronger ammonia water as precipitant using the hydrothermal method. The samples {{were characterized by}} XRD, SEM, TEM and UV-VIS. The {{results showed that the}} influence of the increase of the reaction time on as-prepared anatase nano {{titanium oxide}} was not obvious when stronger ammonia water was not added to Ti(SO 4) 2 solution. Anatase nano titanium oxide became small markedly under the same conditions when stronger ammonia water was added to Ti(SO 4) 2 solution. Anatase nano titanium oxide of about 20 nm in the diameter was obtained for 48 h with pH= 9 at 240 °C by the hydrothermal method. That the size of Anatase nano titanium oxide particles <b>became</b> small was <b>propitious</b> to the blue shift of their absorption peak...|$|R

The knowledge of the electromagnetic transitory behavior of the grounding is a basic condition and of fundamental importance in the determination of effective practices for the insulator protection of the electrical systems against the lightning flashes; the above mentioned behavior can predict to him by means of a grounding model with dynamic answer and analytical base for the computational calculation, which in turn represent in analogical form to the grounding. A technique of analytical exploration can be use as instrument to reduce the grounding impedance of the towers. In this work a route of analysis can development for the definition of the grounding model and of his response at the transitory of impulse current type lightning, applicable to the grounding the towers of Transmission Lines; this model takes as a base the Theory of Transmission Lines, possesses the simplicity and facility of his implementation that <b>becomes</b> <b>propitious</b> by the Program ATP. Thereby simulations have been effected, with big effectiveness, achieving the analysis in the domain of the time and of the frequency with the parameters of interest, to obtain in every case the maximum overvoltage and the impedance of impulse that allow to control and check the behavior of the Isolation of the electrical lines to lightning flashes. Las salidas del servicio no programadas de una Línea de Transmisión constituyen un indicador importante de su desempeño, según las estadísticas de la operación de la mayoría de los sistemas eléctricos en el mundo, las causas principales son las descargas atmosféricas. El conocimiento del comportamiento electromagnético transitorio del aterramiento es condición básica y de fundamental importancia en la determinación de prácticas eficaces para la protección del aislamiento de los sistemas eléctricos contra las descargas atmosféricas; dicho comportamiento puede predecirse mediante un modelo de Puesta a Tierra con respuesta dinámica y con base analítica para el cálculo computacional, que a su vez represente en forma analógica al aterramiento.

De ese modo se han efectuado simulaciones con gran eficacia, logrando el análisis en el dominio del tiempo y de la frecuencia con los parámetros de interés, para obtener en cada caso la sobretensión máxima y la impedancia de impulso que permiten controlar y verificar el comportamiento del Aislamiento de las líneas eléctricas ante descargas atmosféricas...|$|R
40|$|The Central and East European Countries (CEECs) {{have begun}} {{to show signs of}} more or less brisk {{economic}} recovery. It may, however, take time until their economies will have offset the severe setback they had to face between October 2008 and March 2009. The degree to which individual CEECs suffered from the international financial and economic crisis varies considerably, due to a range of different factors. Poland was an exception, as its GDP growth decelerated without coming to a complete halt in 2009. This had quite an impact as the size of the Polish GDP is {{similar to those of the}} Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia put together. The only other country where growth did not stop entirely was Albania. In sharp contrast to these two countries, the Baltic countries and Ukraine had to face a drastic decline in their GDP. The performance of all other CEECs ranged somewhere between these two extremes. It is rather unlikely that the CEECs will any time soon be returning to GDP growth rates as high as those they had achieved in the last pre-crisis years. The European and global business environment has <b>become</b> less <b>propitious,</b> and may not improve in the near future. In addition, the producing sector has been finding it more difficult and costly to get access to borrowing. Markets are likely to remain sceptic about high current account deficits, which, if true, would entail far-reaching changes in conditions especially for the Baltic and Southeast European countries.
