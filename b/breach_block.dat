50|$|The gunner {{does not}} have a hatch and is seated forward of the commander. The gunner has a x6 {{magnification}} periscope, as well as a x6 magnification sight. The main gun was the Type 61 90 millimeter calibre rifled gun with a horizontal sliding <b>breach</b> <b>block.</b> The gun is fitted with a t-shaped muzzle brake, which diverts firing gases sideways, and reduces the amount of dust kicked up by firing. A coaxial 7.62 millimeter machine gun is mounted next to the gun.|$|E
5000|$|Initially the Boers had two Long Toms. The {{bombardment}} commenced on 2 November 1899, {{with one}} of the Long Toms firing from Pepworthy Hill. The second Long Tom was emplaced on Bulwana Hill and started firing on 8 November.On 27 November the Boers brought a third Long Tom and emplaced it on Middle Hill. Two old howitzers were brought up and one had a lucky shot, killing or injuring nine Boer gunners and damaging the Long Tom itself[...]The Boers moved the Long Tom on Pepworth Hill to Gun Hill (Lombardskop) on or about 7 December. A couple of nights later the Brits launched a commando attack again this gun, damaged its muzzle with a charge of gun cotton and removed its <b>breach</b> <b>block.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1947, {{there was}} the [...] "Battle of Earith Gap". Melting snow had built up in the Fenland waterways, unable to be {{released}} into the sea because of high tides. On 17 March a 50 yd gap was torn in the river bank, and water poured out to flood the Fen farms for five days. Eventually the <b>breach</b> was <b>blocked</b> with amphibious vehicles while more orthodox repair work was carried out.|$|R
50|$|Following the war, ten of {{the units}} were towed to Portland Harbour. Following the great storm of January 1953, eight of those at Portland {{were given to the}} Netherlands to <b>block</b> <b>breaches</b> in the dykes. The two units left behind remain moored as a wind break, helping ships berth at 'Q Pier'.|$|R

50|$|The Type 61 (Japanese: ろくいちしきせんしゃ Kanji: 61式戦車) was a main {{battle tank}} (MBT) {{developed}} {{and used by}} the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF), built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.Development started in 1955 and the vehicle was first deployed in April 1961. The type number follows the year of deployment. A total of 560 Type 61's were manufactured between 1961 and 1975, when production ceased. The Type 61 is conventionally laid out, with a central turret and the engine located {{at the rear of}} the hull. The tank has a crew of four, a commander, driver, gunner and loader. The hull is welded steel, with a cast steel turret. The maximum armour thickness is quoted as 64 millimeters. A 12.7 mm machine gun was normally mounted on the cuppola for anti-aircraft use. The main gun was the Type 61 90 millimeter caliber rifled gun with a horizontal sliding <b>breach</b> <b>block.</b> The gun is fitted with a t-shaped muzzle brake, which diverts firing gasses sideways, and reduces the amount of dust kicked up by firing.

50|$|On 6 April the White City again {{came under}} attack. The Japanese shelled and bombed the block {{throughout}} the afternoon. Calvert recalled that the terrain combined with meticulous {{attention to detail}} in constructing the positions provided shelter, and that casualties were low. The only effective weapon the Japanese possessed was a 6-inch mortar, an old coastal defence piece they had laboriously dragged through the jungle to bombard the block. The mortar fired a bomb {{four and a half}} feet long that was in flight for more than 30 seconds. Calvert described the mortar as “the bane of our existence.” Calvert spent the attack in a dugout, coordinating his troops’ response via telephone. He reported that stiff resistance led by his friend Ian MacPherson prevented the Japanese from <b>breaching</b> the <b>block.</b>|$|R
50|$|It has a 52 calibre barrel with a tied jaw {{horizontal}} sliding <b>block</b> <b>breach</b> and ‘pepperpot’ muzzle brake. The {{latter is}} not notably efficient, but subjective reports {{suggest that it}} is quite effective in reducing muzzle flash. The hydro-pneumatic recoil system comprises a buffer below the barrel and a recuperator above the barrel. The long barrel enables a substantial propelling charge by providing more length in which to achieve ‘all-burnt’ and hence projectile acceleration space and thus achieve its 930 m/s muzzle velocity.|$|R
5000|$|There was an {{exceptional}} rainstorm in August 1948; heavy rain started on Wednesday 11 August, and in 24 hours from 10 a.m. that day 4.6 {{inches of rain}} fell. The East Coast Main Line railway was <b>breached,</b> and a <b>blocked</b> culvert at Ayton impounded a huge volume of floodwater on land above the line, leading to fears for Eyemouth if the water suddenly became released. The centre pier of the Eye Water viaduct was [...] "carried away" [...] by the volume {{of water in the}} Eye watercourse.|$|R
50|$|Gosaba has 372.5 km of {{embankments}}, {{the highest}} amongst the 13 Sundarban CD <b>Blocks.</b> <b>Breaches</b> in these embankments varied from 6 km in 2003-04 to 54 km in 2006-07. Embankments raised along rivers are {{of critical importance}} {{for the safety of}} lives and protection of crops, against daily tides and tidal surges. Technologically the embankment structures are weak and there is need of proper drainage of accumulated rain water through sluice gates. Crude cuts in embankments for drainage of accumulated rain water and channels built for providing water to large fisheries (bheris) also add to the hazards. Cyclones and tropical depressions are regular threats.|$|R
40|$|Network {{security}} is a crucial aspect for administrators due to increasing network size and number of functions and controls (firewall, DPI, parental control). Errors in configuring security controls may result in serious security <b>breaches</b> and vulnerabilities (<b>blocking</b> legitimate traffic or permitting unwanted traffic) that must be absolutely detected and addressed. This work proposes a novel approach for validating network policy enforcement, by checking the network status and configuration, and detection of the possible causes in case of misconfiguration or software attacks. Our contribution exploits formal methods to model and validate the packet processing and forwarding behaviour of security controls, and to validate the trustworthiness of the controls by using remote attestation. A prototype implementation {{of this approach is}} proposed to validate different scenarios...|$|R
50|$|The D-74 has a 52 calibre barrel, with {{a double}} baffle muzzle brake and a {{semi-automatic}} vertical sliding <b>block</b> <b>breach,</b> with a tied jaw and the block moving down to open. The barrel is mounted in a long ring cradle with the trunnions just forward of the breach. The recoil system (buffer and recuperator) is mounted on the cradle above the barrel. Compression balancing gear is attached behind the saddle support, passing through the complex shaped saddle to connect to the cradle just forward of the trunnions. This can be manually re-pressured by a pump below the breach. The breach has a projectile retaining catch to prevent the shell sliding out at higher elevations before it is rammed with a manual rammer.|$|R
2500|$|At {{midnight on}} 6 June 1811, 180 volunteers from Houston's {{division}} assaulted San Cristobal. The 25-man forlorn hope managed to reach to ditch with only minor casualties {{only to discover}} that the ditch had been cleared of debris and the <b>breach</b> had been <b>blocked</b> up by carts and chevaux de frise. The rest of the storming party poured into the ditch and tried to mount the wall. But the wall was [...] high while their ladders were only [...] long. Led by Captain Chauvin of the 88th Line, the defenders directed musketry at their attackers and rolled fuzed shells into the ditch. After an hour of futile effort, the Allied troops retreated with losses of 12 dead and 80 wounded. The French only lost one killed and five wounded in the affray.|$|R
500|$|On 10 August 1984 loyalist {{prisoner}} Benjamin Redfern, {{a member}} of the Ulster Defence Association, attempted to escape from HM Prison Maze by hiding {{in the back of a}} refuse lorry, but died after being caught in the crushing mechanism. On 7 July 1991, IRA prisoners Nessan Quinlivan and Pearse McAuley escaped from HM Prison Brixton, where they were being held on remand. They escaped using a gun that had been smuggled into the prison, wounding a motorist as they fled. On 9 September 1994 six prisoners including an armed robber, Danny McNamee and four IRA members including Paul Magee, escaped from HM Prison Whitemoor. The prisoners, in possession of two guns that had been smuggled into the prison, scaled the prison walls using knotted sheets. A guard was shot and wounded during the escape, and the prisoners were captured after being chased across fields by guards and the police. In March 1997 a [...] tunnel was discovered in H7 at the Maze Prison. The tunnel was fitted with electric lights, and was [...] from the outside wall, having already <b>breached</b> the <b>block's</b> perimeter wall. On 10 December 1997 IRA prisoner Liam Averill, serving a life sentence after being convicted of the murder of two Protestants, escaped from the Maze dressed as a woman. Averill mingled with a group of prisoners' families attending a Christmas party, and escaped on the coach taking the families out of the prison. He was never apprehended.|$|R
40|$|A heavy storm caused catastrophic {{floods in}} the summer of 2010 {{throughout}} southern China. Fu River, the second largest river in Jiangxi Province, with a length of 312 km and a drainage area of 15, 800 km 2, experienced a 50 -year return flood. A 347 m long segment of levee, Changkai Levee, breached on the evening of 21 June 2010 and 65, 000 out of 100, 000 residents in four towns were besieged by the breaching inflow. The <b>breach</b> was later <b>blocked</b> in 58 hours. This paper first introduces the process of the levee breach and studies the associated failure mechanisms. The main reasons for the failure are the low design standard (i. e. the design criterion is 20 -year return flood while the actual flood reached the 50 -year return level), erodible sandy soil conditions in the levee, and the scour of levee by the rapid water flow nearly vertical to the levee. Subsequently the procedures of rescuing the residents and <b>blocking</b> the <b>breach</b> are described. Finally why so many residents were besieged but no casualty was caused is explained. © 2011 ASCE...|$|R
500|$|Land mines {{were first}} {{used by the}} JNA in early 1991, before its {{withdrawal}} from Croatia, to protect military barracks and other facilities. Even JNA facilities located in urban centres were secured in this way, using mines such as the PROM-1 bounding mine and MRUD directional anti-personnel mine. The Croatian Army (HV) and Croatian police began laying land mines in late 1991, relying heavily on them to stop advances by the JNA and the Army of the RSK (ARSK) until early 1992. These early minefields were laid with little documentation. In 1992 the ARSK increased its use of mines to secure the front line, largely due to its limited number of troops. Consequently, the ARSK constructed static defensive lines (consisting of trenches, bunkers and large numbers of mines designed to protect thinly-manned defences) to delay HV offensives. This approach was necessitated by the limited depth of RSK territory {{and the lack of}} reserves available with which to counterattack (or <b>block)</b> <b>breaches</b> of its defensive line, which meant that the ARSK was unable to employ defence in depth tactics. [...] The combination of poor documentation of minefield locations and the lack of markings (or fencing) led to frequent injuries to military personnel caused by mines laid by friendly forces. It is estimated that a total of 1.5million land mines were laid during the war.|$|R
40|$|Failure modes for earth dams are {{extensively}} {{reviewed and}} analysed using a three-pronged approach including a literature review, physical observations of a representative earth dam site and finite element structural {{analysis of the}} dam wall. Several failure scenarios are used for predicting consequences in terms of downstream inundation and damage. The fluid flow component is performed using the mesh-free smoothed particle hydrodynamics method. For a representative earthen dam, piping and landslip are identified as key failure modes based {{on a combination of}} finite element analysis, theory and physical observations. Inundation behaviour is very different for the two failure modes. The landslip failure is the most critical one for the dam studied with flood water breaking the river bank and affecting surrounding property and farmland. For the piping failures, water flow from the initial pipes formed for significant periods before they collapse, but the flow rates are small compared with that of the much larger landslip mode. After failure, fragments of the collapsing wall <b>block</b> the <b>breach</b> and can considerably restrict the flood discharge. In some cases, the water pressure is able to push the obstructing material downstream and some minor flooding occurs, but in others cases the <b>breach</b> can remain <b>blocked</b> with little flooding occurring. A prototype risk framework is developed using the small database of the pre-computed flooding scenarios and key variables that affect inundation such as water level in the reservoir. This can be used to estimate inundation maps for as yet non-computed scenarios through interpolation and superposition techniques. The implementation of the risk framework is demonstrated by the estimation of inundation maps for two in-between non-computed reservoir levels. Inundation due to multiple breaches is also estimated by superposition of three single-breach scenarios. Results are compared against the simulated multiple breach. A preliminary implementation of this risk framework into a geographic information system is also described. 42 page(s...|$|R
