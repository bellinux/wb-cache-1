40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the application simulating the rolling process of steel in terms of coexistence of liquid and solid phases. The created mathematical models can be the basis for creation of systems that simulate the final phase of the continuous casting process relying on using a roller <b>burnishing</b> <b>machine</b> for continuous casting of steel. For a complete description of the performance of the material during deformation in these conditions, the constructed mathematical model is a fully three-dimensional model and consists of three parts: thermal, mechanical, and density variation submodels. The thermal model allows the prediction of temperature changes during plastic deformation of solidifying material. The mechanical model determines the kinetics of plastic continuum flow in the solid and semi-solid states, and the resulting deformation field. The temperature of the process forces supplementing the description of the performance of the material with a density variation model that allows the prediction of changes in the density of the material during the final phase of solidification with simultaneous plastic deformation. For the purpose built model, experimental studies were performed using a physical simulator Gleeble 3800 ®. They allowed the determination of the necessary physical properties of the metal within the temperature of change state. In addition to presenting the developed models the work also includes the description of the author’s application that uses the above mathematical models. The application was written in the fully object-oriented language C++ and is based on the finite element method. The developed application beside the module data input, also consist of a module of three-dimensional visualization of the calculations results. Thanks to it, the analysis of the distribution of the particular rolling parameters in any cross-section of the rolled strip will be possible.

40|$|Burnishing is used {{increasingly}} as a {{finishing operation}} which gives additional advantages such as increased hardness and optimum surface roughness and becoming more popular in satisfying the increasing demands of machine component performance. It {{is very difficult}} getting rounded surfaces which are desired where hole machining process (turning, honing, reaming and burnishing). In this study, surface characterizations of getting surface with <b>burnishing</b> and other <b>machining</b> process was evaluated. Especially, inner surface of hole was examined and machining process compared. In the present work, Al 6061 aluminum alloy is selected as work piece material. The experimental results showed that burnishing process must be used where roundness is important.

40|$|Burnishing is {{a plastic}} {{deformation}} {{process that can}} be used to finish surfaces by plastic deformation of surface irregularities. The <b>burnishing</b> is chipless <b>machining</b> which can be used to improve the surface roughness and surface hardness on any metal work piece. The purpose of the research was to demonstrate the roller burnishing process on Cu-Zn-AL to enhance the mechanical properties of Cu-Zn-Al shape memory alloy and improve surface quality and surface microhardness. The experiments were carried on Cn-Zn-Al SMA using CNC turning machine with various spindle rotations, feed rates and depth of penetration, where a roller burnishing tool was designed and manufactured to be used in this investigation. It was found that the surface roughness and microhardness on various Cu-Zn-Al SMA were improved by high spindle speed, The best results were attained at 212 N burnishing force, 50 mm/min feed rate and 1120 rpm...|$|R
40|$|In {{a single}} roller {{burnishing}} process, a hardened and polished roller is penetrated against a revolving cylindrical workpiece. Rotation of tool {{is parallel to}} the axis of rotation of the workpiece. Roller burnishing process is a superior chipless finishing process. It is done on machined or ground surfaces for both external and internal surfaces. Roller burnishing is used to improve the mechanical properties of surfaces as well as their surface finish. In this experiment cylindrical Aluminum alloy (Al- 6061) workpiece has been <b>burnished</b> using different <b>machining</b> parameters [Speed, Feed, and Depth of Penetration and Number of passes. ]. The experiment was carried on lathe machine. It is observed that Depth of Penetration is the significant parameter to control the surface finish (Ra value). The AVOVA results are validated using the AHP method. Here regression model also derived and presented. At the end the confirmation tests conducted to confirm results with the actual Ra values...|$|R
50|$|The process {{involves}} {{cycling the}} coupling {{a number of}} times at a lower inertia, lower speed or a combination of both. Burnishing can require anywhere from 20 to over 100 cycles depending upon the size of a coupling and the amount of initial torque required. For bearing mounted couplings, where the rotor and armature are connected and held in place via a bearing, burnishing does not have to take place on the machine. It can be done individually on a bench or in a group burnishing station. If a clutch has a separate armature and rotor (two piece unit) burnishing is done as a matched set, to make sure proper torque is achieved. Similarly, two-piece brakes that have separate armatures should be <b>burnished</b> on a <b>machine</b> rather than a bench because any change in the mounting tolerance as that brake is mounted to the machine may shift the alignment so the burnishing lines on the armature, rotor or brake face may be off, slightly preventing that brake from achieving full torque. Again, the difference is only slight so this would only be required in a very torque sensitive application.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSurface and {{subsurface}} {{characteristics of}} structural components {{for use in}} production equipment and machines, depending on the functions and their usage in service, can be the critical aspect from the service life viewpoint. Generated surface and subsurface characteristics of manufactured components affect functional performance with progressively deteriorating wear, corrosion and fatigue resistance, and consequently determine the effective life of components of such machines and equipment in various industries including aerospace, automotive and power industries. Developing advanced processing methods and predictive models to control surface integrity characteristics of components for achieving improved product life and performance has been an area of significance in advanced manufacturing. This paper summarizes and highlights recent advances in developing novel manufacturing techniques involving cryogenically-assisted processing (<b>machining,</b> <b>burnishing</b> and friction-stir processing) {{on a range of}} aerospace, automotive and biomedical metal alloys (Co-Cr- Mo, AZ 31 BMg, NiTi, Inconel 718, SS 303 stainless steel, and Al 7050) for achieving enhanced product quality, life and performance at component level. This study presents an analysis of surface integrity involving severe plastic deformation (SPD) of these materials induced by cryogenically-assisted manufacturing processes, by showing the resulting product/component performance enhancement through the generation of controllable ultra-fine/nano grain structures in the surface layers of the products/components. This grain refinement is also often accompanied by improved wear and corrosion resistance properties and the generation of compressive residual stresses enabling improved fatigue life, along with more favorable phase transformation in these cryogenically-processed materials. Experimental results are compared with predictions obtained from numerical models and simulations. Encouraging trends are observed with potential for applications in industry...|$|R
40|$|The sliding of a wedge {{indenter}} (tool) {{against a}} metal surface provides a model {{system in which}} deformation and flow phenomena underlying surface generation processes such as <b>machining,</b> <b>burnishing,</b> surface attrition, polishing and sliding wear can be explored in situ. Particle Image Velocimetry are {{used in conjunction with}} high-speed imaging of the sliding region to analyze characteristics of the plastic flow such as strain, strain rate, rotation and kinematics. The evolution of large plastic strains on the metal surfaces is characterized in terms of process parameters, e. g., wedge incidence angle, velocity and material initial condition. It is shown that the surface strain and subsurface strain distributions can be controlled within limits. Methods for creation of very large plastic strains (3 ̆e 10) on surfaces are demonstrated. The sliding wedge system also provides capability to impose controlled strain rates in conjunction with the large strains. Since the microstructure and mechanical properties of the generated (or conditioned) surface are a consequence of the interactive combinations of strain, strain rate and temperature imposed in the deformation zone, the results provide guidance for engineering surfaces with graded microstructures and properties. ^ When the angle of incidence between the wedge and the surface is varied from small to large values, various transitions in the metal flow are observed including plastic instabilities, surface fold formation and fluid-like flow features, and segmented chip/wear particle formation. The in-situ observations have enabled an understanding of the origins of these flow transitions, including a new mechanism of delamination wear. Various methods for in-situ flow visualization in metal deformation constitute another important outcome. ...|$|R
