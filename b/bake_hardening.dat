The performances of conventional high strength steels are not sufficient. It has been found out that bake hardenable steel sheets are an excellent solution to the above problem. These steels offer good formability (low yield strength for good shape fixability) during press operations and also higher final yield strength during paint baking operations for good dent resistance.

The coating is applied by a robot controlled nozzle that moves from the bottom to top, as the rocket part rotates on a table. Several coats are applied, building up to the desired thickness.

The use of {{advanced}} high-strength-steels (AHSS) is increasing in populary for almost every vehicle manufactures. They are {{result of a}} never-ending quest for material that allows different increases. AHSS vehicle panels are thinner, lighter and stronger that mild and many high-strength steel panels and accomplish the same desired effect for collision energy management. However the addition of AHSS used in vehicle construction has raised some concerns about the identity and characteristics of these steels, where they are commonly located, {{and to what extent}} they can be repaired. The best method to determine a steel type on a vehicle {{is to look at the}} vehicle-specific body repair information. High strength steel are generally defined as having tensile strengths between 270 and 700 MPa. Ultra high strength steels (UHSS) sre defined as steels with tensile strength greather than 700 MPa. Steel hardness is dependent on the alloying elements used during the manufacturing process. Carbon is the primary hardening element in steels, and is used varying percentages depending on the desired strength. However, many AHSS steels derive their strength from a combination of ferrite (more commonly known as iron) bainite, martensite, and retained austenite. AHSS grades have unique combinations of material and mechanical properties. Most have carefully selected chemical compositions and multiphase microstructures resulting from precisely controlled heating and cooling processes. Various strengthening mechanisms are employed to achieve a range of strength, ductility, toughness, and fatigue properties. Improved manufacturing processes have, in many cases, been key contributors to the implementation of these technologies. Conventional mild steel has a relatively simple ferritic microstructure; it typically has low carbon content and minimal alloying elements, is readily formed, and is especially sought for its ductility. Widely produced and used, mild steel often serves as a baseline for comparison of other materials. Conventional low- to high-strength steels include IF (interstitial free), BH (<b>bake</b> <b>hardened),</b> and HSLA (high-strength low-alloy). These steels generally have yield strength of less than 550 MPa and ductility that decreases with increased strength. Medium carbon steel 0, 3 % C to 0, 6 % C are selected for uses were higher mechanical properties are needed. All these medium carbon steels are suitable for wide variety of automotive application. Borron is an interstitial element and has a very low solubility in α-solid solution (≤ 0, 003 %). The primary function of borron additions to heat teratablesteels is to increase their hardness. In addition to the benefits of economy ond alloy conservation borron steel offer significan adventages of better extradability and machinability compared with borron-free steelsof equivalent hardness. Moreover steels containig borron are also less susceptible to quench cracking and distortion heat treatment. Consequently, borron-containing carbon and alloy steels are widely used in automotive, constructional, and various other application. Some investigators have reported that a small beneficial effect of borron on toughness after tempering to high hardness levels and a slightly adverse effect at lower hardness. On the other hand, for steels partialy hardened or unhardened, borron either did not have a beneficial effect on impact properties or apparently had an adverse effect. The maintain the desired B-hardness effect, strong nitrade-forming elements, such as Ti, Al, Zr and even B (at high levels) can be added to combine with the available nitrogen in B-treated steels. TiN is one of the stronest stable niitride. When using Ti to protect B, common steelmaking practice is to add at least the stoichiometric amount of Ti to precipitate any available N before B addition. The type of borron steel used on vehicle today has extremely high strength. Borron steel can have a yield point of about 1. 350 to 1, 400 N/mm 2. That’s about for times stronger than average high-strength steel. The application of borron steel to strengthen the weaker areas of the motor vehicle is obviously for the motor industry that is the correct path for them to take. Not only are there many other new steels all with differing strengths, there are also many new coatings whitch the steel has been treated with. Coatings such as Zinc, Bonazinc, Granocoating, aluminated sheet metals etc. USIBOR-BTR-Borron are also the same grade of steel, just with a different name, depending which country it comes from.

In addition, low carbon steels and ferritic stainless steels are used to produce certain automotive components. The aim of this work is to study the static strain aging phenomenon of two low carbon steels and a ferritic stainless steel, more importantly, by means of <b>bake</b> <b>hardening</b> tests. This thesis consists of two parts, namely literature study and research parts. The literature study covers the topics like carbon steel, ferritic stainless steel, strain aging, and <b>bake</b> <b>hardening.</b> Two low carbon steels with small difference of production history and EN 1. 4003 ferritic stainless steel were used for the experiments. <b>Bake</b> <b>hardening</b> (BH) tests, consisting of pre-straining to 0 %, 2 %, 6 %, and 10 % and following heat-treatments of 170 °C/ 20 min and 230 °C/ 20 min, respectively, were conducted. The purpose of the heat treatments was to simulate the paint baking process after press forming. In addition, to evaluate the aging behavior during storage, a heat treatment of 100 °C/ 30 min (boiling water) was carried out and was followed by tensile testing, respectively. The study indicates that two low carbon steels have very similar initial properties and behavior in the experiments. The 170 °C/ 20 min heat treatment increased 41 MPa and 230 °C/ 20 min increased around 130 MPa in yield strength of the low carbon steels, while for EN 1. 4003 ferritic stainless steel, these two numbers are 20 and 8 MPa, respectively. The yield strength generally increased and elongation decreased with the increase of heat-treatment temperature and pre-strain. The higher baking temperature led to greater BH index generally. The BH index of low carbon steel increased from 19 MPa to around 54 MPa along with the pre-strain increasing from 0 % to 10 % when baked at 170 °C, while it decreased from 72 MPa to 58 MPa when baked at 230 °C. The 100 °C/ 30 min aging treatment did not produce significant influence on the properties of three investigated ferritic steels. It can be concluded that the bake-hardening is the main mechanism of achieving strength increase, and it heavily depends on the dislocation caused during pre-strain...|$|E

However, the manufacture of such alloys involves a variety of other variables, the interactions between which are influential in controlling the extent of hardening.

Experimental works were aimed to obtain the best possible strengthening parameters as well as work hardening and solid solution ferrite hardening, which are the result of thermal activation of interstitial carbon atoms during paint-baking of auto body. Hardening process coming from interstitial atoms is realized as two-step process. The fi rst step is BH (<b>bake</b> <b>hardening)</b> effect achieved by interaction of interstitial atoms with dislocations. The Cottrels atmosphere is obtained. The second step of BH effect is to produced the hardening from precipitation of the carbon atoms in ε-carbides, or formation of Fe 32 C 4 carbides. WH (work hardening) effect is obtained as dislocation hardening from plastic deformations during sheet deep drawing. Experimental works were aimed at as to achieve such plastic material properties after cold rolling, annealing and skin-pass rolling, which would be able to classify the material ZStE 220 BH into the drawing categories at the level of DQ – DDQ. As resulting from the experimental results, the optimal treatment conditions for the maximal sum (WH+BH) = 86 MPa are as follows: total cold rolling deformation εcold = 65 %, annealing temperature Tanneal. = 700 °C.

Estes aços podem ser usados na parte estrutural das portas, vigas, pilares B, perfis, reforço de estruturas, pára-choques, tetos, capôs e partes do chassi dos carros. O foco deste trabalho foi estudar o comportamento mecânico destes aços após deformação plástica, em diferentes temperaturas e tempos de envelhecimento. O método utilizado é semelhante ao aplicado atualmente pelas indústrias automobilísticas, durante o processo de pintura, chamado Endurecimento ao Forno (efeito <b>Bake</b> <b>Hardening).</b> O efeito visa melhorar a resistência mecânica e manter a conformabilidade, o baixo peso da estrutura e a resistência ao impacto, característicos deste tipo de aço, possibilitando a redução de espessura/peso sem perda da resistência à formação de mossa (dent resistence). Os parâmetros de temperatura e tempo utilizados foram baseados nos processos de envelhecimento conhecidos pelo mercado para os aços Dual Phase e TRIP (Plasticidade Induzida por Transformação) como base de informações, pois para os aços Complex Phase este processo é pouco estudado.

The Complex Phase steels are {{developed for the}} automotive industry although are being timidly used. These steels {{could be used in}} the structural part such as doors, beams, B columns, profiles, stringers, bumpers, roofs, hoods and other body parts. The focus of this work was to study the mechanical behavior of these steels after plastic deformation at different temperatures and aging times. The used method is similar to that currently applied by the automobile during painting, called the <b>Bake</b> <b>Hardening.</b> The aim is to improve the mechanical strength, maintaining the formability, low weight of the structure and impact strength, typical of this kind of steel, allowing the reduction in thickness / weight loss without losing dent resistance. The temperature and time parameters used were based on the aging processes known for Dual Phase and TRIP (Transformation Induced Plasticity) steels since information for the Complex Phase is not well reported. The tests were performed on the material as supplied, and the parameters used were pre-strain of 2 % ± 1, aging temperatures ranging from 25 to 180 ºC for periods ranging from 300 to 9. 000. 000 seconds. Microstructure and mechanical properties of material were analyzed to define the best condition for the aging of Complex Phase Steel through tensile and hardness tests, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy was observed a increased resistance around 890 MPa without a significant loss of ductility. It was also studied the aging kinetics, aiming to characterize the phenomenon by varying the value <b>Bake</b> <b>Hardening</b> with time and temperature for pre-strain of 2 % in tension. We can conclude that the multiphase steel Complex Phase presents the best condition for the <b>Bake</b> <b>Hardening</b> effect at 180 ºC in accordance with the standards and the literature, this condition improves their resistance, keeps their tenacity, and suggests the best condition [...] .

An increase in number density and sizes of clusters and nanoscale precipitates was observed in both steels but was more significant in the Nb-Al-Mo steel than in the Nb-Al steel. This increase could be explained by the possible fast diffusion of Nb and Mo atoms at low temperatures, as was observed for surface diffusivity.
