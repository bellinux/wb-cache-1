Cutter stumbles upon the scene, and Borden is arrested.|$|E
5|$|When Quatermass and {{his team}} reach the crash area and succeed in opening the rocket, they {{discover}} that {{only one of the}} three crewmen, Victor Carroon, remains inside. Quatermass and his chief assistant Paterson (Hugh Kelly) investigate the interior of the rocket, and are <b>baffled</b> <b>by</b> what they find: the space suits of the others are present, and the instruments on board indicate that the door was never opened in flight, but {{there is no sign of}} the other two crewmen.|$|E
5|$|American {{intelligence}} analysts were quite <b>baffled</b> <b>by</b> {{this series of}} enemy actions. For them {{there appeared to be}} no logic behind the sustained NVA/NLF offensives, other than to inflict casualties on the allied forces. This they accomplished, but the casualties absorbed by the North Vietnamese seemed to negate any direct gains they might have obtained. The border battles did, however, have two significant consequences that were unappreciated at the time—they fixed the attention of the American command on the border regions and they drew American and ARVN forces away from the coastal lowlands and cities, in preparation for the Tet Offensive.|$|E

Civil War historian Blair Worden comments that [...] "Vane's opaque political ideas and religious beliefs are now barely intelligible", and biographer David Parnham writes [...] "He presented himself as a 'witness' of light, as a spiritualist, as one dispensing advanced wisdoms in the epistemological setting of an imminent and apocalyptic age of the Spirit".|$|R
5|$|Homer and Bart {{rent the}} film Paint Your Wagon, expecting {{it to be}} a shoot-em-up Western. Homer is dismayed to find out that it is {{actually}} a musical, and expresses his distaste for such films. Marge is <b>baffled</b> <b>by</b> this, saying that he ironically loves singing. The family starts delivering their dialogue in song form, and Marge decides to prove that Homer loves to sing by showing family videos. Several clips are shown of various songs from past episodes, but Homer is not convinced. At this moment, Snake breaks into their house and holds them hostage. However once he hears them singing, Snake decides that they would not make good hostages and leaves.|$|E
5|$|Juste meets Maxim at {{a castle}} where Lydie {{is being held}} captive; after a brief talk, he leaves Maxim outside and begins to explore the castle. Within the castle, Juste {{encounters}} Death, who confirms that the castle is Dracula's. He then meets up with a dazed Maxim, whose memory is slowly returning to him, and they split up to cover more ground. While trekking through the castle, Juste notices that the castle sometimes has different atmospheres. He continues to encounter Maxim, but is <b>baffled</b> <b>by</b> how his friend seems to change personalities periodically. Regardless, {{in one of their}} meetings, Maxim reveals that he went on a journey to find and destroy the remains of Dracula, something Simon Belmont had previously done, but when he collected all six, his memory went blank.|$|E
5|$|The party {{arrived at}} the vicarage to be greeted by Mrs Blackburne. (Mrs Blackburne had {{originally}} intended to travel on the inaugural journey with her husband, but the previous day had felt a presentiment {{that something was wrong}} at home and her presence was required, and had returned alone by boat. She had then heard a rumour that a mob from Oldham were planning to storm the track at Eccles to attack the Duke of Wellington, and decided to remain in the vicarage.) Huskisson was moved to the sofa, and given laudanum and brandy. At about 2.00pm Hunter and Brandreth cut Huskisson's clothing away from his damaged leg to give it a proper examination. Unfamiliar with industrial injuries, they were <b>baffled</b> <b>by</b> the nature of the damage to Huskisson's leg, but concluded that despite the apparent severity of his injuries the wounds were treatable.|$|E

5|$|Throughout March and April, allied {{intelligence}} was <b>baffled</b> <b>by</b> {{the movements of}} the units belonging to the North Vietnamese 2nd Division, and that was reflected in the information obtained by U.S. military forces. For example, the U.S. 1st Marine Division reported that the enemy's 2nd Division Headquarters, the 3rd Regiment, the 21st Regiment, and the VC's 1st Regiment were within the vicinity of Khâm Đức, Thượng Đức, and Hội An, respectively. In contrast, information released by the U.S. 27th Marines Regiment showed the presence of the 3rd and 21st Regiments near Goi Noi Island, whereas the 2nd Division Headquarters was reported to be in the Que Son Valley. Despite the lack of accurate information, allied intelligence generally agreed the North Vietnamese might begin attacking isolated outposts and units as their next course of action. Subsequently, on 4 May 1968, the Americal Division made amendments to their Golden Valley Plan, the plan for the relief and reinforcements of CIDG camps, to enable the deployment of the 1st Battalion, 46th Infantry Regiment, 196th Light Infantry Brigade to support Khâm Đức.|$|E

25|$|During the Great Depression in Canada {{the demand}} for radical action peaked around 1934, after the worst period was over and the economy was recovering.

25|$|During the Great Depression in Canada {{the demand}} for radical action peaked around 1934, after the worst period was over and the economy was recovering. Mortgage debt was a social issue because many farmers could not make their {{payments}} and were threatened with foreclosure by banks. Although the UFA government passed legislation protecting farm families from losing the home-quarter, many farm families lived in poverty and faced {{the loss of the}} land base needed for viable profitable farms. Their insecurity was a potent factor in creating a mood of political desperation.

25|$|Brunswick seemed <b>baffled</b> <b>by</b> Hoche's clumsy {{attack on}} his army. In his {{subsequent}} actions the Prussian failed to fully cooperate with his colleague Wurmser. Despite its defeat, {{the morale of}} the Army of the Moselle was unaffected. The French soldiers remained sure of themselves, perhaps because of their capture of enemy-held territory before the battle. Hoche fortified Pirmasens and Blieskastel and mounted a false attack against Brunswick. But this was a smokescreen to cover his real intentions which were to shift his strength against Wurmser's western flank. Already on 23 November, Philippe-Joseph Jacob's division was moved to Niederbronn-les-Bains. This was joined by Taponier's division on 5 December and Jean Grangeret's division a week later. On 22 December 1793, Hoche defeated Wurmser in the Battle of Froeschwiller.|$|E
25|$|Historians, James Huston notes, {{have been}} <b>baffled</b> <b>by</b> {{the role of}} high tariffs in general and have offered {{multiple}} conflicting interpretations over the years. (Low tariffs, all historians agree, were noncontroversial and were needed to fund the federal government.) One school of thought says the Republicans were the willing tools of would-be monopolists. A second schools says the Republicans truly believed tariffs would promote nationalism and prosperity for everyone along with balanced growth in every region (as opposed to growth only in the cotton South). A third school emphasizes the undeniable importance of the tariff in cementing party loyalty, especially in industrial states. Another approach emphasizes that factory workers were eager for high tariffs because it protected their high wages from European competition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. At {{present the}} {{study on the}} {{application}} of the topology optimum design in scraper conveyor is still under development. In this paper the topology optimization based on the homogenization method is applied to the design of the baffle on the scraper conveyer, which can provide a valuable conceptual design scheme for the selection of the baffle pattern. In conjunction with the homogenization theory and Finite Element Method (FEA), the mathematical models for designing the <b>baffle</b> <b>by</b> the minimizing mean compliance are developed in this paper. By applying the topology optimum design to the baffle, the topology optimization based on the homogenization method is proved to be reliable and practical at the conceptual design stage of baffle...|$|R
5000|$|In some cases, {{submarine}} commanders {{could choose}} to clear <b>baffles</b> <b>by</b> executing one or a series of hard turns in order to not only clear the baffles, but also be in a favorable position to attack the potentially following submarine. Such extreme maneuvers were more commonly used by Soviet Navy submarines during the Cold War than by other forces, leading to the maneuver's nickname: [...] "Crazy Ivan". The [...] "crazy" [...] came from the danger such a maneuver posed to both submarines, first being detection of the following submarine, which was commonly avoided by stopping the engines and going to maximum silence, and secondly by collision, as {{the momentum of the}} pursuing boat could result in collision with the leading submarine; dead ahead in the process of turning sharply.|$|R
25|$|Casino (1995), like The Age of Innocence before it, {{focused on}} a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is {{disrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to fans of the director who perhaps were <b>baffled</b> <b>by</b> the apparent departure of the earlier film. Casino was a box office success, but the film received mixed notices from critics. In large part this was due to its huge stylistic similarities to his earlier Goodfellas, and its excessive violence that garnered it a reputation as possibly the most violent American gangster film ever made. Indeed, many of the tropes and tricks of the earlier film resurfaced more or less intact, most obviously the casting of both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Pesci once again playing an unbridled psychopath. Sharon Stone was nominated for the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance. During the filming Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.|$|E
25|$|In December 1776, John Burgoyne {{returned}} to London to set strategy with Lord George Germain. Burgoyne's {{plan was to}} establish control of the Champlain-George-Hudson route from New York to Quebec, isolating New England. Efforts could then be concentrated on the southern colonies, where it was believed Loyalist support was in abundance. Howe instead argued capturing Philadelphia and defeating Washington was a priority. Germain approved this plan, leaving Howe unable to assist Burgoyne. Washington himself was <b>baffled</b> <b>by</b> Howe's choices. Alden argues Howe {{was influenced by the}} idea that, upon success, he would not receive credit, but Burgoyne. Controversy persists over whether Germain approved Burgoyne's plan after reading Howe's, and whether he shared this information with his subordinates. Howe was not given any explicit orders to assist Burgoyne, however, a copy Germain sent to Quebec explicitly stated Howe was to assist Burgoyne's efforts. Another letter stated Howe should launch his campaign against Philadelphia as intended, while allowing enough time to assist Burgoyne. Black argues Germain either left his generals too much latitude, or without a clear direction.|$|E
25|$|Instead, Napoleon {{planned on}} {{launching}} {{an invasion of}} Portugal from three directions, with Soult and 20,000 men overrunning the north, Lapisse with 9,000 troops advancing from the east, and Victor pushing in from the south. Robert Thomas Wilson's aggressive use of his 1,200 Portuguese regular troops completely fooled Lapisse, who became convinced that he was outnumbered and halted his advance. <b>Baffled</b> <b>by</b> Wilson's maneuvers, he was withdrawn and ordered to rejoin Victor. On 14 May 1809 Lapisse brushed aside Colonel Mayne's 1,850 Portuguese regulars and militia in the Battle of Alcantara in Extremadura. Lapisse's 2nd Division and a brigade of dragoons were engaged, a total of 9,500 soldiers and 12 guns. The Portuguese lost 250 men while French casualties were described as light. Lapisse's men sacked the town before rendezvousing with Victor at Mérida. Two days before, the British army of Arthur Wellesley's won a victory over Soult's corps at the Second Battle of Porto and chased him out of Portugal. So ended the second unsuccessful French invasion of that nation.|$|E

25|$|Alexios {{became aware}} that a {{substantial}} Seljuq army was approaching {{from the north and}} began his retreat to his own territory. His army resumed its defensive formation with the civilians accompanying the baggage in the centre. The Turks, under an officer called Manalugh, were initially <b>baffled</b> <b>by</b> the Byzantine formation and did not attack with any vigour. However, the following day Sultan Malik Shah arrived and the Byzantines were attacked in earnest. The Turks mounted a simultaneous attack on the van and rear of the Byzantine army. The Byzantine cavalry made two counterattacks, the first seems to have been unsuccessful, with Alexios' son Andronikos being killed. A further counterattack was more fortunate, led by Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger (Anna Komnene's husband and Alexios' son-in-law) the leader of the Byzantine right wing, it broke that part of the Turkish force led in person by the Sultan, which then turned to flight. Malik Shah narrowly escaped capture. The Seljuqs then made a night attack, but the Byzantine dispositions again frustrated them. The following day Malik Shah again attacked, his troops completely surrounding the Byzantine army on all sides. The Turks were once more repulsed with loss, having achieved nothing. The next day Malik-Shah sent to Alexios with proposals for peace.|$|E

5000|$|Crazy Ivan is a {{cold war}} term used in the US to {{describe}} two different concepts. The most common usage was the name given to a maneuver used by Soviet submarines to clear their <b>baffles</b> <b>by</b> performing a sudden, unexpected and dangerous 360° turn abaft, {{to see if they}} were being followed to their stern in the baffles, the spinning of which prevents Sonar from detecting the pursuing vessel [...] The second use was a catch-all term for the possibility of a rogue Soviet leader committing to military action, typically in reference to a limited launch of ICBMs against the US. The term Red October was sometimes used to describe the second concept, a reference to the 1984 Tom Clancy novel The Hunt for Red October in which a rogue Soviet submarine commander appears to threaten to launch a nuclear strike on the US. The novel uses the first version of the term as a plot point.|$|R
