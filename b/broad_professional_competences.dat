40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) A study into English {{language}} teaching in Indonesia has been conducted. English {{language teaching}} in Indonesia {{has not been}} successful in its goal of producing effective English speakers. Part of {{the problem has been}} inadequate teaching. The Indonesian government has taken steps {{to improve the quality of}} English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers. One of these steps has been a process of certification. The main objective of the certification for EFL teachers was to improve the quality of teachers, specifically, to strengthen their <b>professional</b> <b>competence.</b> With certification came an increase in remuneration. There is little evidence that certification has improved the quality of EFL teachers. The data gathered by the current study provides further evidence that the current process of certification has not produced the desired result. Teacher certification in Indonesia is problematic because the notion of <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> proposed by the Ministry of Education is insufficient to cover a <b>broader</b> conception of <b>professional</b> <b>competence.</b> Teachers are only assessed through portfolio; there is no assessment of their performance in the classroom. There is little evidence that certification improves teachers’ <b>professional</b> <b>competence.</b> There is no training incorporated into certification to improve teachers’ competence. The current study examined attitudes towards certification by EFL teachers and EFL assessors. Quantitative (surveys) and qualitative data (interviews) were gathered. Analyses of the data showed widespread dissatisfaction with the current process of certification. On the basis of empirical findings and theoretical perspectives, a proposal for an improved process of teacher certification is presented. This process includes pre-training and post-training, observation of teachers in classrooms, and on-going certification. The current study makes a substantial contribution to a reconceptualization of certification of EFL teachers in Indonesia...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{relationship}} between Teacher <b>Professional</b> <b>Competences</b> and Teacher Work-Autonomy. The purposes of this research were to investigate; first, what are Teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> of Sekolah Sukma Bangsa teachers in Aceh; second, what is Teacher work-autonomy of Sekolah Sukma Bangsa teachers in Aceh; third, what relationships can be found between teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> and Teacher Work-Autonomy and of Sekolah Sukma Bangsa teachers in Aceh; fourth, is there any difference in Teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> based on gender, school location, classroom teacher/subject teacher, grade level or teaching experiences; and, fifth, is there any difference in Teacher Work-Autonomy based on gender, school location, classroom teacher/subject teacher, grade level or teaching experiences. The thesis presents a quantitative research study carried in Aceh, Indonesia in 2016. The research data were collected through questionnaires. Seventy teachers participated in providing information for this research work. The participants completed two questionnaires on teachers work-autonomy and teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> Friedman s teacher work-autonomy construct measured teacher perceived autonomy, while Niemi s teachers <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> construct measured teacher perceived <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> Research results indicate that most teachers of Sekolah Sukma Bangsa in Aceh occupied moderate degree of teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> {{and most of the}} teachers attained a moderate degree of work-autonomy. This study results also claim that there was a moderate and positive correlation between teacher work-autonomy and teachers <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> The direction of correlation was positive and there was evidence found of correlation between Teacher work-autonomy and Teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> The results indicate that when level of teacher autonomy increase, the level of teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> escalated, and lower level of teacher autonomy is associated with lower level of teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> Supplying teacher with high level of work autonomy is one obvious way to upsurge teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> As degree of autonomy increased, degree of competences increased. On the opposite, when the score of autonomy decreased the score of <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> is decreased. Teacher autonomy was associated with teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> Research results also indicate that a degree to which teachers perceived work-autonomy and a degree to which teachers perceived <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> were diverse based on gender, classroom/subject teacher, experience, level of school and location of school, even though the differentiations were not statistically significant. This research suggests that one way to increase teachers levels of <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> is by enhancing teachers degrees of autonomy in the schools. School administrators should consider decentralizing the power of decision making in school and accommodate teachers to participate autonomously in school activities both in the classroom area and the school wide area...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{aspect of}} work integrated learning (WIL) {{is the development}} of <b>professional</b> <b>competence,</b> the ability of students to perform in the work place. Alignment theory therefore suggests that the assessment of WIL should include an assessment of students’ demonstration of <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> in the workplace. The assessment of <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> in WIL is, however, problematic. It may be impractical for the academic supervisor to directly assess <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> if there is a large number of students in external placements. If evidence of <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> is provided by the student, the student’s ability to articulate his or her own capabilities will interfere with the validity of the assessment. If evidence of professional competency is provided by the supervisor then the assessment is heavily dependent on the individual supervisor and may be unreliable. This paper will examine the literature relating to the assessment of <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> in WIL. The paper will be informed by the author’s experience in coordinating a WIL subject in an undergraduate law course. It will recommend that a mix of evidence provided by the student, the workplace supervisor and the academic supervisor should be used to assess <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> in WIL...|$|R
