After falling over to the left, enemy aircraft went down vertically. He has also been instrumental in bringing down other enemy machines.|$|E
25|$|Stereopsis {{was first}} {{described}} by Wheatstone in 1838. In 1840 {{he was awarded}} the Royal Medal of the Royal Society for his explanation of binocular vision, a research which led him to make stereoscopic drawings and construct the stereoscope. He showed that our impression of solidity is gained by the combination in the mind of two separate pictures of an object taken by <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> eyes from different points of view. Thus, in the stereoscope, an arrangement of lenses or mirrors, two photographs of the same object taken from different points are so combined as to make the object stand out with a solid aspect. Sir David Brewster improved the stereoscope by dispensing with the mirrors, and bringing it into its existing form with lenses.|$|E

But I feel like, by now, they know who we are, and I wanted something really different. I didn't feel like {{we had to put}} a photo on the cover, I wanted it to be more mysterious and more about Evanescence itself, not just me."

Heik was responsible {{for a lot of}} that. My conception of a good guard is one that stops anything that comes his way on defense and leads the blocking on offense. Heik has done just that. When we have the ball he is our fifth man in the backfield. He pulls out most of our plays and bowls over the opposition. We have made most of the gains through the line over his position.” ...|$|E
500|$|On September 29, 2009, Randazza {{requested}} that Beck voluntarily {{ask that the}} First Amendment {{be applied to the}} arbitration case, despite its international setting. Randazza made this request because Beck's political commentary favored the United States Constitution over international law. Randazza's September 29, 2009 letter to Beck's attorneys cited statements by Beck in which he indicated he preferred United States law over international law. Beck had said, [...] "Once we sign our rights over to international law, the Constitution is officially dead."

The episode {{was also the first}} to give a name to Marceline's father: Hunson Abadeer. According to Moynihan, the name was inspired by the name that his brother had given their family's car when they were growing up. The two later used it for a band that only recorded one song. To create the demonic effect of Marceline talking while possessed with the amulet, Olivia Olson and her father were required to say their lines in tandem. She later explained: [...] "We were going back-and-forth, line to line … We were screaming back and forth at each other, and trying to match pitches and stuff.

Evanescence then played several concerts in the United Kingdom, beginning at London's Hammersmith Apollo on November 4 and finishing the leg on November 13 at the O2 Academy Birmingham. Supported by The Pretty Reckless, Fair to Midland and Rival Sons, the tour's set list included songs from Evanescence's three albums.

She said, [...] "So we did that back and forth, which he always does with me until I get my point across. ... and then we met up and we got <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> ideas and feelings across. I wanted to be sexy and dark like the song is, in a really interesting way, and we pulled it off, I think." [...] The video was filmed in Los Angeles, California in late-April 2011, just before Dev joined Usher as the opening act for his OMG Tour. Dev took {{more control over the}} [...] "In the Dark" [...] video than previous video shoots as she used to let the director [...] "take a little bit of control" [...] when she was inexperienced in the process. In an interview with Idolator, Dev elaborated on the video's concept, stating that she wanted a dark feel similar to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland: [...] "I wanted the video to be sexy as well.

2500|$|In April 1823, U.S. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams {{discussed}} {{the rules of}} political gravitation, in a theory {{often referred to as}} the [...] "ripe fruit theory".

He furthermore warned that [...] "the transfer of Cuba to Great Britain would be an event unpropitious to the interest of this Union". Adams voiced concern that a country outside of North America would attempt to occupy Cuba upon its separation from Spain. He wrote, [...] "The question <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> right and our power to prevent it, if necessary, by force, already obtrudes itself upon our councils, and the administration is called upon, in the performance of its duties to the nation, at least to use all the means with the competency to guard against and forfend it".|$|E

[...] According to Roy Hattersley, a changed Britain entered the war in 1914, [...] "the political, social and cultural revolution had already happened. Modern Britain was born in the opening years of the twentieth century." [...] Asquith also worked strenuously to secure a settlement of the Irish question and, although unsuccessful, his work contributed to the 1922 settlement. Lastly, as a [...] "great head of a Cabinet," [...] Asquith directed and developed the talents of an extraordinary array of parliamentarians, for an extraordinarily long period. Hazlehurst contends that this [...] "ability to keep so gifted and divergently-inclined a group in harness (was) one of his major achievements." [...] Overall, Brock argues that; [...] "on the basis of his achievements 1908 to 1914 he must rank among the greatest British statesmen of any era."

Shortly after the departure of Ross and Walker, Smith revealed the band was recording: [...] "We're working on an album now that, hopefully, takes the best parts from <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> records ... because we love them both and are really proud of them."

2500|$|In {{the speech}} Bannon invoked the Christian {{concept of the}} Church Militant.

[...] Bannon {{went on to say}} [...] "I believe we've come partly off-track in the years since the fall of the Soviet Union and we're starting now in the 21st century, which I believe, strongly, is a crisis <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> church, a crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, a crisis of capitalism. And we're at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict, of which if the people in this room, the people in the church, do not bind together and really form what I feel is an aspect of the church militant, to really be able to not just stand with our beliefs, but to fight for our beliefs against this new barbarity that's starting, that will completely eradicate everything that we've been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years." [...] Bannon maintained that [...] "the West" [...] was successful due to a capitalism based on [...] "the underlying spiritual and moral foundations of Christianity and, really, Judeo-Christian belief." [...] Which was under threat from [...] "state-sponsored capitalism... you see in China and Russia.", from [...] "Ayn Rand or Objectivist School of libertarian capitalism", and from [...] "immense secularization of the West... the overwhelming drive of popular culture is to absolutely secularize this rising iteration [...]" [...] Bannon held that the undermining of [...] "enlightened capitalism", and the loss of [...] "Judeo-Christian belief" [...] he held it was based on, were in dangerous decline right as [...] "we are in an outright war against jihadist Islamic fascism" [...] which includes Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Boko Haram [...] "and other groups that will eventually partner with ISIS in this global war". Bannon called on Christian capitalists to examine the purpose of their wealth and if divine providence was calling on them [...] "to actually be a creator of jobs and a creator of wealth...and make sure that we are reinvesting that back into positive things... bind together as partners with others in other countries" [...] which would better prepare the West at these [...] "the very beginning stages of a global conflict".|$|E
