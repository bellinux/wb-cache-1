40|$|In this paper, several iron-free solenoid-based {{designs of}} a {{detector}} magnet {{for the future}} circular collider for hadron-hadron collisions (FCC-hh) are presented. The detector magnet designs for FCC-hh aim to provide bending power for particles over a wide pseudorapidity range (0 ≤|η|≤ 4). To achieve this goal, the main solenoidal detector magnet is combined with a forward magnet system, such as the previously presented force-and-torque-neutral dipole. Here, a solenoid-based alternative, the so-called balanced forward solenoid, is presented which comprises a larger inner solenoid for providing bending power to particles at |η|≥ 2. 5, in combination with a smaller <b>balancing</b> <b>coil</b> for ensuring that the net force and torque on each individual coil is minimized. The balanced forward solenoid is compared to the force-and-torque-neutral dipole and advantages and disadvantages are discussed. In addition, several conceptual solenoid-based detector magnet designs are shown, and quantitatively compared. The main difference between these designs {{is the amount of}} stray field reduction that is achieved. The main conclusion is that shielding coils can be used to dramatically reduce the stray field, but that this comes at the cost of increased complexity, magnet volume, and magnet weight and reduced affordability...|$|E

40|$|Metallic {{contaminant}} detectors {{based on}} the <b>balanced</b> <b>coil</b> system are widely used in the food industry. In the <b>balanced</b> <b>coil</b> system, an excitation coil and two identical pickup coils are used {{in a way that}} the magnetic coupling of pickup coils to the excitation coil is cancelled with each other when no metallic contaminants present. In a conventional system, the excitation coil and the pickup coil are planar and are parallel, therefore the magnetic coupling is strong even if there is no metallic contaminant. Such strong magnetic coupling makes balancing procedure tedious. In this paper, we introduce a new coil system in which pickup coils are set orthogonal to the excitation coil, making the magnetic coupling much small compared to conventional counterpart. Pickup coils are equipped with thin magnetic cores and placed inside the excitation coil being parallel to the excitation <b>coil</b> plane. The <b>balancing</b> method consists of two steps; the one is geometrical and the other is digital processing including down conversion. Experiments are carried out to show the detection capability of ferromagnetic contaminants and non-magnetic contaminants...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Results {{of studies}} of {{electromagnetic}} instabilities in Nb 3 Sn strands and cables produced using the Restack Rod Process technology are presented. The critical current of the strands was measured using the voltage-current and voltage-field methods. Magnetization was measured using a <b>balanced</b> <b>coil</b> magnetometer. Effects of strand deformation were studied. A superconducting current transformer with a maximum DC current of 28 kA was used for cable testing at self-fields under various experimental conditions. These results are in good agreement with magnet test data {{as well as with}} experimental studies of similar strands and cables. The strand and cable parameters, equipment and measurement methods used, and the results of the measurements are herein described. I...|$|R

50|$|Coil {{designers}} {{also tried}} out innovative designs. The original induction <b>balance</b> <b>coil</b> system {{consisted of two}} identical coils placed {{on top of one}} another. Compass Electronics produced a new design: two coils in a D shape, mounted back-to-back to form a circle. This system was widely used in the 1970s, and both concentric and D type (or widescan as they became known) had their fans. Another development was the invention of detectors which could cancel out the effect of mineralization in the ground. This gave greater depth, but was a non-discriminate mode. It worked best at lower frequencies than those used before, and frequencies of 3 to 20 kHz were found to produce the best results. Many detectors in the 1970s had a switch which enabled the user to switch between the discriminate mode and the non-discriminate mode. Later developments switched electronically between both modes. The development of the induction balance detector would ultimately result in the motion detector, which constantly checked and balanced the background mineralization.|$|R
5000|$|The current {{conceptions of}} a [...] "Pagan rock" [...] genre lay with two musical strands: first, {{with the idea}} of a modern music created by and for Neopagans as typified by the artist Gwydion Pendderwen and, secondly, with the occult themes pursued by early {{industrial}} music pioneers Genesis P-Orridge (Throbbing Gristle, Psychic TV) and John <b>Balance</b> (<b>Coil,</b> Current 93). Unlike the previous dabbling with occult and romantic pre-Christian themes pursued by rock bands in the 1960s and early 1970s (as typified by artists such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Donovan), these new artists were earnest subscribers to Neopagan religion (in the case of Pendderwen) and ritual magic (in the case of P-Orridge and Balance Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth). The mixture of openly Neopagan lyrics, occultism, and the counter-cultural impulses of the post-punk era would create fertile soil for the inspiration of several bands that would form from the late 1980s forward.|$|R

40|$|Using a Cu {{stabilized}} Nb{sub 3 }Al strand with Nb matrix, a 30 meter long Nb{sub 3 }Al Rutherford cable {{was made}} by a collaboration of Fermilab and NIMS. Recently the strand and cable were tested. In both cases instability was observed at around 1. 5 Tesla. The magnetization of this Nb{sub 3 }Al strand was measured first using a <b>balanced</b> <b>coil</b> magnetometer at 4. 2 K. Strands showed an anomalously large magnetization behavior around at 1. 6 T, which {{is much higher than}} the usual B{sub c 2 } {approx} 0. 5 Tesla (4. 2 K) of Nb matrix. This result is compared with the magnetization data of short strand samples using a SQUID magnetometer, in which a flux-jump signal was observed at 0. 5 Tesla, but not at higher field. As a possible explanation for this magnetization anomaly, the interfilament coupling through the thin Nb films in the strands is suggested. The instability problem observed in low field tests of the Nb{sub 3 }Al Rutherford cables is attributed to this effect...|$|R

40|$|Since 2005, we {{made and}} tested three RHQT Nb{sub 3 }Al strands, one with Nb matrix and two with Ta matrix, which are fully {{stabilized}} with Cu electroplating. We observed anomalously large magnetization curves extending beyond 1 to 1. 5 Tesla with the F 1 Nb matrix strand at 4. 2 K, when we measured its magnetization with a <b>balanced</b> <b>coil</b> magnetometer. This problem was eliminated with the Ta matrix strands operating at 4. 2 K. But with these strands a similar but smaller anomalous magnetization {{was observed at}} 1. 9 K. We studied these phenomena with FEM. With the F 1 Nb matrix strand, it is explained that at low external field, inter-filamentary coupling currents in the outer layers of sub-elements create a shielding effect. It reduces the inside field, keeps the inside Nb matrix superconductive, and stands against a higher outside field beyond the Hc of Nb. At an even higher external field, the superconductivity of the whole Nb matrix collapses and releases {{a large amount of}} energy, which may cause a big quench. Depending {{on the size of the}} energy in the strand or the cable, a magnet could quench, causing the low field instability. Some attempt to analyze the anomaly with FEM is presented...|$|R
40|$|Long Nb{sub 3 }Al strands with copper {{stabilizer}} {{are promising}} for future high field accelerator magnets. A 1. 2 kilometer Nb{sub 3 }Al strand with Cu stabilizer was fabricated at the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan. Using this strand a 30 meter Cu stabilized Nb{sub 3 }Al Rutherford cable {{was made for}} the first time by a collaboration of NIMS and Fermilab. The Nb{sub 3 }Al strands extracted from cable with a relatively low packing factor showed almost no J{sub c} degradation. But the extracted strands from the highly compacted cable showed some degradation in both J{sub c} and n value, which may be caused by local separation of the copper stabilizer. Still, its J{sub c} degradation is lower than that of typical Nb{sub 3 }Sn strands. The current limit due to magnetic instability in low field is about 500 A at 4. 2 K. The magnetization of the strands, which was measured with <b>balanced</b> <b>coils</b> at 4. 2 K, showed large flux jumps, usually around 1. 5 T. This value is much larger than the B{sub c 2 } (4. 2 K) of the Nb matrix, which is around 0. 4 Tesla. The magnetic instability of the Nb{sub 3 }Al strand at low field is not completely understood, but it might be explained by the superconducting coupling current through the Nb matrix...|$|R

25|$|The balance {{consisted}} of a circular steel balance wheel with two bimetallic strips attached diametrically. Each bimetallic strip terminated with a screw thread mounted with a weight or balance nut. The further along the strip this nut was screwed, the greater the compensating effect. Another part of the patent concerned an addition to {{the form of the}} <b>balance</b> spring—a <b>coil</b> of smaller radius {{at each end of the}} helical spring, which offered increasing resistance to the rotating balance as it turned towards the end of each vibration. This was an important invention, as it largely eliminated the problem of the positional adjustment of balance controlled watches. This device, known as the Overcoil balance spring is still used today in most precision mechanical watches.|$|R

40|$|Nuclear {{criticality}} {{safety in}} Separations canyon facilities is maintained primarily by {{control of the}} concentration of fissile materials in process equipment. Confidence in the attainment of this goal is clearly dependent upon how a measurement of solids concentration from the local sampling technique relates to concentrations elsewhere in the vessel, and {{on the quality of}} mixing prevailing under operating conditions. Clarification was therefore needed {{of the relationship between the}} local concentration of solids found at the present regular sampling point, and the prevailing maximum and average throughout the vessel. An experimental study was performed to document the quality of mixing for dilute solids suspension in an aqueous phase in baffled, paddle-agitated, cylindrical tanks used in Separations canyon facilities. Measurements were made for those variables that are capable of adjustments in the full scale: namely impeller speed, height of the total liquid, and number of impellers on the shaft. Appropriate total liquid levels and minimum impeller speed for just complete suspension of solids were established for the full scale operation. The effects of particle size distribution and mean concentration of solids are demonstrated, and conditions under which the regular single sampling point gives results comparable to the average of variously placed measurements around the vessel are identified. Solids distribution in the radial and axial directions were examined and some recurring trends have been identified. A simplified mass <b>balance</b> and <b>coil</b> impediment calculations indicate the need for new sampling techniques to explore the region around and between the impellers...|$|R
50|$|Tibet's main musical outlet is {{the band}} Current 93, the only {{constant}} member {{of which is}} Tibet himself. Current 93's first release was the cassette-only Mi-Mort, a split C60 with Nurse With Wound. The first vinyl release was LAShTAL, with the line-up of Tibet, John <b>Balance</b> of <b>Coil</b> and Psychic TV and Fritz Haaman (Fritz Catlin) of 23 Skidoo.David Tibet, the soul man of Current 93, often participated in making and producing several records {{by a number of}} industrial bands individually or in the name of Current 93. Those industrial bands include the Nurse With Wound, Coil, and some labels producing industrial noise music, such as Dark Vinyl. Among many important figures of the main line of industrial noise music, the network among David Tibet, Steven Stapleton and John Balance is an indispensable one. These people are proficient in various related musical styles from dark ambient to industrial noise music. They sometimes acquired knowledge from each other when working together, thus {{it is easy to see}} that in the music of David Tibet/Current 93, there are mainly two important genres of underground industrial music including ambient music and dark industry. These mixed styles of music represents the development of the industrial noise music. At the same time, as David Tibet used to be a member of Death in June, which is a band of death folk, the band Current 93 also has some works of neo-folk which are truly related to Death. It is not tough to see that the music created by David Tibet/Current 93 is a production mingled with industrial music, death folk and dark ambient music.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{induction}} tomography (MIT) is a tomographic {{imaging technique}} that {{is able to}} map the electromagnetic properties within an object or vessel from magnetic field measurements. Excitation coils are used to induce eddy currents in the medium, and the magnetic field produced by the induced eddy current is then sensed by receiver coils. Because of its noncontact nature, MIT is particularly attractive for biomedical and some industrial applications, such as pipe-flow monitoring, when compared with traditional contact electrode-based electrical impedance tomography. This paper describes the design and performance of an MIT transceiver circuit that can operate from 400 kHz to 12 MHz. The in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) demodulation technique is {{used to measure the}} signal perturbation due to the induced conduction eddy currents. The transceiver circuit design employs a single integrated circuit, containing a variable-gain amplifier and an I/Q demodulator. This paper contains characterizations of the transceiver's measurement noise, system stability, and sensitivity for detecting saline solutions and metal plates. A novel <b>balanced</b> coaxial screened <b>coil</b> structure with integrated current sensing was also developed to minimize capacitive coupling between coils and to allow measurement of the current in the driving coils. Experiments were carried out at 3 and 10 MHz using bottles of saline solutions (1 %– 5 % concentration) and metal sheets (aluminum and steel) to verify the sensitivity for conductivity imaging...|$|R
40|$|In modem tokamak machines, {{exploration}} and successful development of improved plasma regimes is impossible without adequate control systems. In ASDEX Upgrade, the control tasks are performed by two systems, the continuously operating machine {{control and the}} plasma control active {{as long as a}} plasma discharge lasts. Machine control based on programmable logic controllers operates on a relatively slow timescale of tau = 100 ms to configure and monitor the machine's technical systems. Real-time plasma controllers run on faster cycle times of a few milliseconds to feedback (FB) control plasma shape and performance quantities. During the burn of a discharge, a real-time supervisor monitors the full technical and physical system state (tau = 10 ms) and applies alternate discharge program segments to optimize discharge performance or react to failures. The supervisor is fully integrated with a layered machine protection system. Plasma position and shape control in ASDEX Upgrade is particularly difficult: Since the poloidal magnetic field (PF) coils are located reactor relevant outside the toroidal magnetic field coil system and distant from the plasma, each PF coil has a global effect on all shape quantities. This makes simultaneous control of shape parameters a multivariable problem. The feedback control algorithm is based on a matrix proportional-integral-derivative method, adapted to handle saturation of coil currents, excess of coil forces, or to <b>balance</b> loads among <b>coils.</b> Control cycle time is similar to 3 ms. In parallel, the plasma performance control (sometimes called kinetic control) acts on particle fueling and auxiliary heating systems. It consists mainly of FB loops each controlling a single variable. These circuits can be freely combined to simultaneously control a number of different plasma quantities. A clear hierarchy in the control processes allows special real-time processes to override the programmed plasma discharge feedback action: The set of controlled quantities may be changed dynamically, depending on the plasma regime detected; stabilizing actions may be triggered when plasma instabilities grow; and discharge termination by means of impurity addition is initiated when a neural network indicates an imminent disruption. The computation of the needed plasma parameters and instability indicators requires signal inputs from many diagnostic systems during each controller cycle. Currently, a new plasma control system is being implemented as a distributed system of real-time controllers and diagnostic systems, which are connected via a deterministic communication network...|$|R
