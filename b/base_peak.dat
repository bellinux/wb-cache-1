In the PIEI mode, molecular ions appeared for all compounds. Cations at m/z M- 121, corresponding to [M-OCOC 6 H 5]+, constituted <b>base</b> <b>peaks</b> for all compounds. In PICI mass spectra, all compounds showed intense [M+ 1]+ quasi-molecular cations, which constituted <b>base</b> <b>peaks,</b> together with small peaks at m/z [M+C 2 H 5]+ and/or [M+C 3 H 5]+.

In the PIEI mode, molecular ions appeared {{in all four}} compounds and three of them constituted the <b>base</b> <b>peaks.</b> In the PICI modes, intense [M]+ and [M+ 1]+ ions were observed; [M]+ ions were the <b>base</b> <b>peaks</b> for all compounds.

In the NICI mode, [M- 1]- <b>peaks</b> constituted the <b>base</b> <b>peaks,</b> but were much less intense than in other modes. In the SI mode, single and intense [M- 3]+ peaks appeared; these peaks are probably due to aromatization of the N-methyltetrahydropyridine ring.

50|$|The peak in {{the mass}} {{spectrum}} with the greatest intensity is called the <b>base</b> <b>peak.</b> The molecular ion is often, but not always, the <b>base</b> <b>peak.</b> Identification of the molecular ion can be difficult. Examining organic compounds, the relative intensity of the molecular ion peak diminishes with branching and with increasing mass in a homologous series. In the spectrum for toluene for example, the molecular ion peak is located at 92 m/z corresponding to its molecular mass. Molecular ion peaks are also often preceded by an M-1 or M-2 peak resulting from loss of a hydrogen radical or dihydrogen.|$|E

50|$|For linear alkanes, {{molecular}} ion peaks are often observed. However, for long chain compounds, {{the intensity of}} the {{molecular ion}} peaks are often weak. Linear fragments often differ by 14 Da (CH2 = 14). For example, hexane fragmentation patterns. The m/z=57 butyl cation is the <b>base</b> <b>peak,</b> and other most abudant peaks in the spectrum are alkyl carbocations at m/z=15, 29, 43 Da.Branched alkanes have somewhat weaker molecular ion peaks in the spectra.They tend to fragment at the branched point. For the 2,3-dimethylbutane, an isopropyl cation peak (m/z=43) is very strong.Cycloalkanes have relatively intense molecular ion peaks (two bonds have to break). Alkene fragmentation peaks are often most significant mode. Loss of “CH2CH2“ (= 28) is common, if present. However, for the substituted cycloalkanes, they prefer to form the cycloalkyl cations by cleavage at the branched points.|$|E

50|$|In an extracted-ion {{chromatogram}} (XIC or EIC), {{also called}} a reconstructed-ion chromatogram (RIC), {{one or more}} m/z values representing one or more analytes of interest are recovered ('extracted') from the entire data set for a chromatographic run. The total intensity or <b>base</b> <b>peak</b> intensity within a mass tolerance window around a particular analyte's mass-to-charge ratio is plotted at every point in the analysis. The size of the mass tolerance window typically depends on the mass accuracy and mass resolution of the instrument collecting the data. This is useful for re-examining data to detect previously-unsuspected analytes, to highlight potential isomers, resolve suspected co-eluting substances, or to provide clean chromatograms of compounds of interest. Extracted-ion chromatograms are created via a data-mining or data-analysis process; selected-ion chromatograms, discussed below, arise from a completely different type of experiment, i.e., one in which data is collected only for specific m/z values representing compounds or compound types of interest.|$|E

40|$|Two {{series of}} bicyclic sesquiterpanes have been {{identified}} in the crude oil from the Niger delta by Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry. The mass spectra of the sesquiterpanes were compared with those of previously reported compounds. The first series with <b>base</b> <b>peak</b> at m/z 193 or 123 had mass spectra that corresponded with C 15 H 28 (M + : 208) and C 16 H 30 (M + : 222). The second series was distinguished by <b>base</b> <b>peak,</b> m/z 123 and corresponded to C 21 H 40 (M + : 292), that is bicyclic terpanes having branched chain. The presence of these compounds in the Niger delta oil suggests a significant terrigenous input into the source-rock of the oils...|$|E
40|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) is {{a commonly}} used {{tool in the}} analysis of fluorescently labeled PCR amplification products. We have identified a CE artifact caused by the tissue stain eosin that can complicate the interpretation of CE data. The artifact was detected during routine analysis of a DNA sample isolated from a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sample considered histologically suspicious for a B-cell neoplasm. A standard clinical PCR and CE assay for immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene rearrangement revealed a weak polyclonal population of rearranged IGH genes and a 71 <b>base</b> <b>peak</b> suspicious for IGH clonality. The spectral properties of the 71 <b>base</b> <b>peak</b> were unusual in that although the dominant fluorescence of the peak was blue, it also fluoresced in green and yellow (blue>green>yellow), raising the suspicion that the peak might represent an artifact. CE analysis of the genomic DNA sample without PCR amplification demonstrated the presence of the 71 <b>base</b> <b>peak,</b> suggesting that the artifact was caused by a contaminant within the DNA sample itself. We demonstrate that eosin, which was used to stain the formalin-fixed tissue during processing, yields a discrete 71 <b>base</b> <b>peak</b> of similar morphology to the contaminant peak on CE analysis. The data suggest that eosin in the fixed tissue was not completely eliminated during nucleic acid extraction, resulting in the artifact peak. We discuss the implications of this potentially common contaminant on the interpretation of CE data and demonstrate that artifacts caused by eosin can be avoided by using more stringent DNA purification steps. Histological dyes may fluoresce, and artifacts from them should be considered when primary peaks contain additional underlying peaks of other colors...|$|E

40|$|Positive ion {{electron}} impact (PIEI), {{positive ion}} chemical ionization (PICI) and negative ion chemical ionization (NICI) mass spectra are presented for seven dinitroaniline herbicides; and each fragmentation pathway has been analyzed. In the PIEI mode, molecular ions appeared for all compounds, {{but they were}} relatively small. Base or intense cations at m/z M- 29, which probably correspond to [M-C 2 H 5] +, appeared in five compounds; [M - OH]+ peaks also observed for six compounds. In the PICI mass spectra, all compounds showed intense MH+ quasi-molecular ions, which constituted <b>base</b> <b>peaks,</b> together with small peaks at m/z M + C 2 H 5 and/or M + C 3 H 5; small peaks at m/z M - 33, which probably correspond to [MH- 2 OH]+,were observed in six compounds. In the NICI mass spectra, M- molecular anions appeared as <b>base</b> <b>peaks</b> in all compounds. Anions at m/z [M - 30]-, which {{may be due to}} loss of NO, were also observed in common for all compounds. The highest sensitivity could be obtained in the NICI mode by total ion monitoring for all compounds. The calibration curves obtained by selected ion monitoring in the NICI mode for isopropalin, nitralin and trifluralin, showed linearity in the range of 1. 56 - 100 pg on column, with detection limits of 2 - 20 pg on column. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|R
