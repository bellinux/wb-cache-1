40|$|Not long ago, American {{tort law}} clearly {{rejected}} an "outlaw" doctrine: a plaintiff engaged in tortious or criminal acts was not {{treated as an}} outlaw who could be injured with impunity. The plaintiff's <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct</b> might {{give rise to a}} defense such as contributory or comparative negligence under ordinary tort prlnciples, or might trigger a privilege assertable against the plaintiff. However, <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct,</b> by itself, did not inevitably bar the courthouse doors. The second Restatement's rejection of a rule making tortious or criminal conduct an absolute obstacle to recovery in tort was not surprising. Much has changed in American tort law during the past thirty years, including the rules relating to <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct.</b> There are questions as to how far the <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct</b> defense extends. Courts are in disagreement as to both the requirements of the <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct</b> defense and whether the plaintiff or the defendant bears the burden of proof. It makes a world of difference, both to the individual litigant and to the fairness of the justice system, whether <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct</b> is treated as an affirmative defense on which the defendant bears the burden of proof, versus an aspect of proximate causation that precludes a plaintiff from establishing a prima facie case...|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} thesis {{at large}} discusses {{the problems of}} <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct</b> in the economic area, possibilities for its exposure and prevention issues. Every human conduct, apart from the legal viewpoint, may also be assessed from the moral viewpoint, whereas in this context, law is designated as the "moral minimum". From this relationship, we arrive at the conclusion that every instance of <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct</b> is also immoral. On the contrary, conduct that complies with the law always need not be {{in compliance with the}} moral norms. In the Czech Republic, the New Criminal Code came into force on 1 January 2010, which also punishes the most severe forms of <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct</b> and fundamentally affects performance of the accounting and auditing professions. Apart from some concept changes, this Codex also introduced, for instance, changes in the punishability of planning crimes. From the viewpoint of the auditor, tax adviser and accountant, barring of perpetration, whose commitment or planning authentically comes to the knowledge of the auditor, tax adviser or accountant seems to be fundamental. The issues of occupational fraud are mainly related to the problems of the auditing profession. These unlawful acts take various forms, which can be split into three basic groups, which are asset misappropriation, fraudulent statements and corruption. When exposing occupational fraud, as well as other forms of <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct,</b> confidentiality issues are fundamental. In some cases, the law anticipates breaking through this confidentiality, mainly, for the purpose of exposing the most severe forms of <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct.</b> Within the framework of prevention of occupational fraud, internal control systems play an essential role. It is possible to evaluate the existence of ethical codices, respectively, building of ethical corporate culture as very fundamental...|$|R

50|$|Although {{in theory}} one {{could begin to}} study the general {{principles}} of criminal liability with {{any one of these}} three elements, the usual starting point is to consider the accused's conduct. If the State is unable to prove <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct</b> {{on the part of the}} accused, the accused cannot be criminally liable, and the enquiries into criminal capacity and fault become redundant. Criminal capacity and fault are never determined in isolation; they must be determined in relation to the relevant accused's particular <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct.</b> For these reasons, a trial court will normally begin its judgment by considering whether the State has proved the actus reus, before going on to consider the other two elements of liability.|$|R

2500|$|Stewart Lansley, {{writing in}} the Labour Party journal New Socialist in July 1985, argued that the ratecapping fight had very quickly turned from councils {{fighting}} the Government into a fight within the Labour Party.

Martin Loughlin, author of [...] "Legality and Locality", ascribed {{the reason for the}} failure of the ratecapping challenge to the councils not being as united as they appeared; some had viewed it as a direct confrontation of the Government, while the majority saw an opportunity to exploit an ambiguity in the law. Only {{a very small number of}} councils could get a majority for a <b>blatantly</b> <b>unlawful</b> policy.
