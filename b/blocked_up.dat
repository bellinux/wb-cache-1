Applying these techniques to matrix representations of more general D-brane configurations, we find that <b>blocking</b> <b>up</b> averages over far-off-diagonal matrix elements and brings them in towards the diagonal, so that the matrices become "less off-diagonal" under this process. We describe heuristic scaling relations for the matrix elements under this process. Further, we show that <b>blocking</b> <b>up</b> does not appear to exhibit any "chaotic" behaviour, suggesting that there is sensible physics underlying such a matrix coarse-graining. We also discuss briefly interrelations of these ideas with B-fields and noncommutativity.

40|$|Drawing analogies with block spin {{techniques}} {{used to study}} continuum limits in critical phenomena, we attempt to <b>block</b> <b>up</b> D-branes by averaging over near neighbour elements of their (in general noncommuting) matrix coordinates, i. e. in a low energy description. We show that various classes of D-brane (noncommutative) geometries appear to behave sensibly under <b>blocking</b> <b>up,</b> given certain key assumptions, in particular involving gauge invariance. In particular, <b>blocking</b> <b>up</b> on the noncommutative plane moves towards a commutative limiting Riemannian plane. This suggests that the commutative description is a coarse-grained approximation to the noncommutative one, {{in the sense that}} functions on the noncommutative geometry that have a matrix-Taylor expansion collapse down under <b>blocking</b> <b>up</b> to their coarse-grained approximations on the corresponding smooth commutative geometry. We find that this motivates a redefinition of the matrix variables, involving possible "counterterms" to the noncommutative algebra, similar in spirit to usual renormalization in field theory. We then apply these techniques to more general noncommutative geometries and find that <b>blocking</b> <b>up</b> averages over far-off-diagonal matrix elements and brings them in, towards the diagonal. We find constraints on the noncommuting scalar matrices defining the geometry for moving towards a commutative limit. Further, we show that <b>blocking</b> <b>up</b> does not appear to exhibit any "chaotic" behaviour, suggesting that there is sensible physics underlying such a matrix renormalization. We discuss briefly interrelations of these ideas with B-fields and noncommutativity in this preliminary paper...|$|R
5|$|The {{conversion}} to be a dovecote took place around 1780. Pigeons and doves were an important food source historically kept for their eggs, flesh, and dung. Although {{it is now}} a roofless ruin with some of the windows <b>blocked</b> <b>up,</b> it previously had a chimney and the fireplace can still be seen. The National Trust acquired the freehold from Sir Henry Hugh Arthur Hoare of the Hoare baronets, whose family seat was at Stourhead, in 1915. The tower was subsequently designated as a scheduled monument in 1953 and a listed building (Grade II*) in 1961.|$|E

The sewer feeding into the moat was <b>blocked</b> <b>up</b> around {{the middle of the}} century, and the moat, which previously seems to have been kept clean, was allowed to gradually fill up with debris, despite complaints from the House of Lords that this put the Jewel Tower at greater risk of fire and thieves.|$|E
5|$|The first {{church was}} {{markedly}} cruciform {{in shape and}} smaller than the present floor plan. This early structure had a choir without aisles and more truncated, and a nave with only a single aisle on its north and south sides (Fig. 4). The central tower rose above the crossing {{between the north and}} south transepts and may have held bells in its upper storey. The north wall of the choir is the earliest extant structure, dating to the years immediately after the church's 1224 foundation; the clerestory windows on top of it are from the later post-1270 reconstruction. This wall has <b>blocked</b> <b>up</b> windows extending to a low level above ground, indicating that it was an external wall and proving that the eastern limb then had no aisle (Fig. 5).|$|E

5|$|The {{ground floor}} contains, {{in the west}} section, the former dining room and kitchen. The {{openings}} in the wall between the billiard room and the garden room had been <b>blocked</b> <b>up</b> but the rooms were reconnected in the 19th century under Sir William Henry Cope, uncovering an original doorway with a four-centred pointed arch. Cope applied arabesque patterns to the panelling in the garden room, which he had traced when two of the bedrooms were being repainted. The billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance {{on the north side}} of the house through the Foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard, and several doorways remain in the kitchen and housekeeping areas.|$|E
5|$|The major {{exceptions}} to the common Greek cross plan are {{in the work of}} Smith, who had become a Jesuit in his youth. These included the rebuilding of Holyrood Abbey undertaken for James VII in 1687, which was outfitted in an elaborate style. In 1691 Smith designed the mausoleum of Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, in Greyfriars Kirkyard, a circular structure modelled on the Tempietto di San Pietro, designed by Donato Bramante (1444–1514). The drive to Episcopalian forms of worship may have resulted in more linear patterns, including rectangular plans with the pulpit at the end opposite the entrance. The Latin Cross form increasingly popular in Counter Reformation Catholicism, was also used, as in Smith's Canongate Kirk (1688–90), but the Presbyterian revolution of 1689–90 occurred before its completion and the chancel was <b>blocked</b> <b>up,</b> effectively transforming it into a T-plan.|$|E
5|$|Gunports {{for early}} {{gunpowder}} artillery {{had begun to}} be installed in English castles during the 15th century. At Kirby Muxloe, six gunports were constructed in the ground floor walls of both the gatehouse and west tower; these were then temporarily filled with bricks, probably to prevent vermin and to limit the drafts. Several more gunports were built lower down in the gatehouse, presumably in error as they were ultimately below the waterline of the moat and permanently <b>blocked</b> <b>up.</b> The range of any guns at the castle would have been quite limited, as they were positioned relatively low to the ground. Historians are uncertain to what extent any guns at Kirby Muxloe would have been useful in a conflict. The gunports are of early design {{and may have been}} intended to be symbolic rather than practical; they were well positioned across the castle's defences, however, and might well have been intended to deter a serious attack.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{widening}} {{of the tower}} arches in 1270 and 1320 the tower of St.Mary's had been structurally weak. The subsequent addition of the bells and belfry and the lead-covered spire added to {{the weight of the}} tower, and the number of burials of local notables within the church and of parishioners immediately outside the church building weakened the structure further. By the 18th century the problems had become severe enough that the west arch of the south transept was <b>blocked</b> <b>up</b> in an effort the strengthen the structure, and a hollow pillar which housed the stairway to the rood loft was filled in. The tower continued to weaken, a situation made worse by the addition in 1812 of a new ring of six bells with a 17cwt(860kg) tenor bell, cast by Thomas Mears II of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Iron bands were wrapped around the tower to strengthen it but these soon snapped, and by the 19th century large cracks, which had appeared in the tower, were filled with broken bricks and rubble and covered over with roughcast as an interim solution.|$|E
5|$|The west {{range was}} entirely rebuilt by the Gilmours, in the 1660s, {{to provide a}} spacious suite of modern accommodation, to suit Sir John's {{position}} as a senior judge. The ground floor contained a large central drawing room dining room, with large windows, and a carved stone fireplace. This room would also have had plaster ceilings and other decorative features. To the north was a kitchen, and to the south a chamber, with a wine cellar below. The first floor had four bedrooms. Another new stair was built, connecting the west range with the tower house. The door to this tower has a classical pediment, above which is a 20th-century plaque, erected by a descendant of the Gilmours, and bearing the arms of Sir John Gilmour and his wife. The west range is now roofless, the internal floor is also gone, and the large windows have been <b>blocked</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the later}} seventeenth century both the Presbyterian and episcopalian {{wings of the}} church had adopted the {{modestly}} sized and plain form of churches that had emerged after the Reformation. Most had a centralised plan {{with two or three}} arms, in a rectangular or T-planned arrangement. Steeples continued to be a major feature, either centrally on the long axis, or on an end gable, in as had been the case in pre-Reformation churches. As a result, there was little of the baroque extravagance in church building seen on the Continent and England. Some minor innovations may indicate a move back toward episcopacy in the Restoration era. Lauder Church was built by Sir William Bruce in 1673 for the Duke of Lauderdale, who championed the bishops in the reign of Charles II and the Gothic windows of which may have emphasised antiquity, but its basic Greek cross plan remained within the common framework of new churches. The drive to episcopalian forms of worship may have resulted in more linear patterns, including rectangular plans with the pulpit on the end opposite the entrance. The major exceptions to the standard pattern are in the work of James Smith, who had become a Jesuit in his youth. These included the rebuilding of Holyrood Abbey undertaken for James VII in 1687, which was outfitted in an elaborate style. In 1691 Smith designed the mausoleum of Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, in Greyfriars Kirkyard, a circular structure modelled on the Tempietto di San Pietro, designed by Donato Bramante (1444–1514). The Latin Cross form, increasingly popular in Counter Reformation Catholicism, was also used, as in Smith's Canongate Kirk (1688–90), but here it never saw episcopal service as the Presbyterian revolution of 1689–90 occurred before it was completed and the chancel was <b>blocked</b> <b>up,</b> making it, in effect, a T-plan.|$|E

5|$|The central {{range was}} begun around 1500, {{possibly}} as a two-storey building containing a great hall, although only fragments {{of this building}} remain. The south entrance to the tower house was <b>blocked</b> <b>up,</b> and replaced with a ground floor entrance from the east. A new stair tower, with a broad spiral stair, was built at the south-east corner. Originally topped by a conical roof, this stair gave access to the upper floors in the tower, and to the central range. Around 1570, the 4th Earl of Morton rebuilt the block, extending it further south to form new apartments. This block, forming the present three-storey central range, includes a vaulted kitchen and cellar in the basement, with suites of rooms above. The two bedrooms {{on the first floor}} each have their own closets and garderobes, or privies. The west apartment is accessed from the terraced garden, via another stair to the south-west, and has a private stair which led up to another chamber above, suggesting that these were the Earl and Countesses apartments. The upper storey, whose timber floor is now missing, comprised three more apartments, including one over the stair. The exterior of the block is decorated with a horizontal decorative strip of masonry known as a string course. One first-floor window is decorated with carved stone pilasters and strapwork, in a similar style to windows at Edinburgh Castle and Drochil Castle, in the Borders, both of which were built under Morton's Regency.|$|E
25|$|During {{the phase}} of {{occupation}} from 160AD, a number of turrets fell out of use, and their doorways were <b>blocked</b> <b>up.</b> In {{the latter part of}} the second century, or early part of the third century, turrets in the central section of the stone wall (between Turrets 33B and 41B, and many others) were abandoned and demolished. During this process, the turret recess was filled in, presumably to remove a possible point of structural weakness.|$|E

However, some Orcs had crept in through a culvert which let a stream out of Helm's Deep, and while the defenders were busy with {{the assault on the}} wall, they were suddenly attacked from behind. This was repulsed and the culvert was <b>blocked</b> <b>up</b> under Gimli's supervision.|$|E

25|$|The tower {{has been}} subject {{to a series of}} {{modifications}} over the centuries. The lower two floors were completed by 1302 while the third floor was added in around 1350. The watchtower was added in the 15th or 16th century, and in the 18th century some of the openings were <b>blocked</b> <b>up.</b> In addition, there have been changes as result of the restoration work in the 20th century. Areas of protruding stonework on the north and east sides the tower appear to be the remains of the bonding of a defensive curtain wall. On the east side there is a doorway that may have provided access to a walkway {{along the top of the}} wall, while on the north side a similar doorway has been <b>blocked</b> <b>up,</b> presumably at an early date, and fitted with an arrowslit. There is no evidence that a curtain wall at these positions was ever actually constructed and it is possible that the wall formed part of an original plan that was never realized. On the west wall of the tower there are two blocked doorways connecting to the spiral staircase. These are likely to have been used to access garderobes (latrines).|$|E
25|$|The {{north and}} south chapels, {{flanking}} the chancel, open to the chancel by fine arches of two chamfered orders. The south chapel, now used as a vestry, has a four-light east window {{similar to that in}} the north chapel. The 15ft wide arch (now <b>blocked</b> <b>up)</b> leading to the chantry is in the south wall. The organ is raised above the choir vestry (in what was the south transept) which is separated from the south aisle of the nave by a screen, on which is mounted the only medieval woodwork remaining in the church.|$|E

The town walls were strengthened, most of the gates were <b>blocked</b> <b>up</b> and some 200 cannon were deployed. 20,000 regulars were billeted on the Town Moor. These preparations were enough to force the rebel army to travel south via the west coast. They were eventually defeated at Culloden in 1746.|$|E
