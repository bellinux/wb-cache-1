30|$|Once the {{coefficients}} are estimated the travel time distribution can be fully described by random generation {{of a large}} number of samples. In this study the 4180 random samples (same size original data) are generated for SRSM analysis. All this procedure was implemented in MATLAB environment [12]. Travel Time estimated by SRSM model and MLR models are compared against with actual travel time is presented at Fig.  6. From this figure it can be observed that SRSM probability distribution is uni-modal (having one maximum at 625  sec), asymmetrical and similarly follows the actual travel time distribution. Whereas travel time distribution obtained by MLR models are <b>bimodal</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>curves</b> having two peaks, one maximum at 625  s and the other maximum at 925  s. Even travel time distribution estimated by MLR model by considering all the uncertainty parameters (Table  1) also follows <b>bimodal</b> <b>frequency.</b> From this it can be conclude that the MLR models are overestimating beyond the average actual travel time (783  s). It can also be concluded from the Fig.  5 that even if more uncertainty parameters are considered for modeling travel time MLR models are unable to follow the actual travel time distribution. Further, from travel time distribution it can be observed that travel time obtained by SRSM model is well distributed between travel time, 542  s to 2, 302  s. Whereas MLR models estimated travel time distribution varies between 493 to 1, 363  s. From this it can be concluded that MLR models are unable to map the worst case scenarios, this we can observe from tails of the probability distribution of travel time (Fig.  5).|$|R

Inheritance of fresh seed dormancy in Spanish x Spanish crosses was studied with two sets of segregating populations, an F 2 population derived from true F 1 hybrids identified with peanut microsatellites markers and other populations (F 2, BC 1 P 1 S and BC 1 P 2 S) from randomly-selected F 1 individuals. In the F 2 population developed with true F 1 hybrids, the chi square test was not significant for the deviation from the expected 3 : 1 (dormant: non-dormant) ratio. In addition, the <b>bimodal</b> <b>frequency</b> distribution <b>curve</b> with the F 2 population gave more evidence that fresh seed dormancy is controlled by a single dominant gene. The average frequency (48 %) of true F 1 hybrids give evidence that deviations from expected ratios in the populations (F 2 and BC 1 P 1 S) developed from non-tested F 1 individuals, is most likely due to inadvertent selfs. This study emphasized the need to identify with molecular markers the cross progenies in self-pollinated crops as peanut before testing for any trait. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

The Manzanares basin (Spain) was used as a study case. A continuous 100, 000 -year hourly rainfall series was generated using the stochastic spatial–temporal model RanSimV 3. Individual storms were extracted from the series by applying the exponential method. For each year, the extracted storms were transformed into hydrographs by applying an hourly time-step semi-distributed event-based rainfall–runoff model, and the maximum peak flow per year was determined to generate the reference flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve.</b> Then, different flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curves</b> were obtained considering the N storms with maximum rainfall depth per year, with 1 ≤ N ≤ total number of storms.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{illustrate}} the effects of selected catchment storage thresholds upon runoff behaviour, and specifically their impact upon flood frequency. The analysis is carried out with the use of a stochastic rainfall model, incorporating rainfall variability at intra-event, inter-event and seasonal timescales, as well as infrequent summer tropical cyclones, coupled with deterministic rainfall-runoff models that incorporate runoff generation by both saturation excess and subsurface stormflow mechanisms. Changing runoff generation mechanisms (i. e. from subsurface flow to surface runoff) associated with a given threshold (i. e. saturation storage capacity) are shown to be manifested in the flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve</b> as a break in slope. It is observed that the inclusion of infrequent summer storm events increases the temporal frequency occurrence and magnitude of surface runoff events, in this way contributing to steeper flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curves,</b> and an additional break in the slope of the flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve.</b> The results of this study highlight the importance of thresholds on flood frequency, and provide insights into the complex interactions between rainfall variability and threshold nonlinearities in the rainfall-runoff process, which are shown to have a significant impact on the resulting flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curves...</b>|$|R

In contrast, the frequency distributions of these dimensions in the other directions are bimodal, where the different modes can be attributed to earlywood and latewood. Analysis of the bimodal distributions results in the determination of threshold values of cell wall thickness and the lumen dimension for earlywood and latewood tracheids.
