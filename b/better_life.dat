5|$|Despite being {{across the}} world from the conflict, the Australian colonies were {{affected}} by the American Civil War both economically and by immigration. The Australian cotton crop became more important to England, which had lost its American sources, and it served as a supply base for Confederate blockade runners. Immigrants from Europe seeking a <b>better</b> <b>life</b> also found Australia preferable to war-torn North America.|$|E
5|$|Harold Oliver {{was born}} to Cornish {{immigrants}} James Oliver and Sarah Mill in the gold mining town of Waukaringa. It was common for Cornish people, where mining was a key industry, to move to Australia and use their knowledge to attempt a <b>better</b> <b>life</b> as the economy in Cornwall was waning. During Oliver's childhood in the 1890s the town was home to 600 people. Today it is a ghost town.|$|E
5|$|Mikhail Gorbachev's {{introduction}} of the policies of glasnost and perestroika in the 1980s also fueled Armenian visions of a <b>better</b> <b>life</b> under Soviet rule. The Hamshenis who were deported by Stalin to Kazakhstan began petitioning {{for the government to}} move them to the Armenian SSR. This move was denied by the Soviet government because of fears that the Muslim Hamshenis might spark ethnic conflicts with their Christian Armenian cousins. However, another event that occurred during this time made an ethnic clash between Christian Armenians and Muslims inevitable.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Espanyol {{was seen}} by the vast {{majority}} of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in stark contrast to Barça's revolutionary spirit. Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a <b>better</b> <b>life,</b> Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.|$|E

5|$|In early 1859, {{abolitionist}} Republican U.S. Senator William H. Seward sold Tubman a {{small piece}} of land on the outskirts of Auburn, New York, for US$1,200. The city was a hotbed of antislavery activism, and Tubman seized the opportunity to deliver her parents from the harsh Canadian winters. Returning to the U.S. meant that escaped slaves were at risk of being returned to the south under the Fugitive Slave Law, and Tubman's siblings expressed reservations. Catherine Clinton suggests that anger over the 1857 Dred Scott decision may have prompted Tubman to return to the U.S. Her land in Auburn became a haven for Tubman's family and friends. For years, she took in relatives and boarders, offering a safe place for black Americans seeking a <b>better</b> <b>life</b> in the north.|$|E

Unlike the TV series, which is based on the original, nonaddictive version, and which is only briefly mentioned in the novel, the novel version causes the user's imagination to develop semi-plausible explanations for certain events. For instance, in early versions of <b>Better</b> Than <b>Life,</b> the user could make a large, expensive car appear out of thin air. In the books, the user's imagination would create a scenario where they won the lottery, or created a successful business, so they could buy the car.|$|R

5|$|According to Baley, {{political}} and economic factors prompted two Hedgpeth and two Baley families to leave northwestern Missouri for California in early 1858. One factor was {{the enactment of the}} Kansas-Nebraska Act, which admitted Nebraska into the Union as a free territory and granted Kansas the right to decide on the legality of slavery within the state. The resulting tensions between pro-slavery and anti-slavery groups fueled conflict near the Missouri state line, affecting its western counties, including Nodaway, where the Baleys and Hedgpeths lived. In Baley's opinion, the financial Panic of 1857 further contributed to instability in the region, driving many mid-westerners to seek a <b>better</b> <b>life</b> in California. The combined Baley-Hedgpeth outfits were led by a forty-four-year-old veteran of the Black Hawk War, Gillum Baley, and comprised eight Murphy wagons, sixty-two oxen, seventy-five head of cattle, and several riding horses. They employed half-a-dozen grubstakers to tend their stock.|$|E

5|$|In 1634, another tale with a trickster cat as hero was {{published}} in Giambattista Basile's collection Pentamerone although neither the collection nor the tale were published in France during Perrault's lifetime. In Basile, the lad is a beggar boy called Gagliuso (sometimes Cagliuso) whose fortunes are achieved {{in a manner similar}} to Perrault's Puss. However, the tale ends with Cagliuso, in gratitude to the cat, promising the feline a gold coffin upon his death. Three days later, the cat decides to test Gagliuso by pretending to be dead and is mortified to hear Gagliuso tell his wife to take the dead cat by its paws and throw it out the window. The cat leaps up, demanding to know whether this was his promised reward for helping the beggar boy to a <b>better</b> <b>life.</b> The cat then rushes away, leaving his master to fend for himself. In another rendition, the cat performs acts of bravery, then a fairy comes and turns him to his normal state to be with other cats.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have <b>better</b> <b>life</b> satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E
