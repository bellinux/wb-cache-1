5|$|Following the 15th century Reformation when {{clerical}} {{marriage was}} permitted, larger households {{would have been}} required {{and as a result}} some of the houses were altered and combined by knocking through walls, into larger dwellings. Others had extensions built to the rear. Water supply was originally from two wells, one {{at each end of the}} close. By 1468 lead pipes had been installed to <b>bring</b> <b>water</b> into the houses, although the wells continued to function until the 19th century. Number 22 is the house which still has most of its original medieval structure as it was originally built.|$|E
5|$|The colony {{supported}} mostly rain-fed agriculture, {{with limited}} irrigation {{for its first}} 30 years. The only cash crops were nuts gathered close to the railroad between Kayes and Bamako. However, following successful tests of growing Egyptian cotton in West Africa during World War I, Émile Bélime began to campaign {{for the construction of}} a large irrigation system along the Niger river. Starting in 1921, significant irrigation projects around Koulikoro and later at Baguinéda-Camp and the Ségou Cercle began to <b>bring</b> <b>water.</b> The French believed this project could rival the major cotton growing centers of Egypt and the United States.|$|E

25|$|The Romans {{constructed}} numerous aqueducts {{in order}} to <b>bring</b> <b>water</b> from distant sources into their cities and towns, supplying public baths, latrines, fountains and private households. Waste water was removed by complex sewage systems and released into nearby bodies of water, keeping the towns clean and free from effluent. Aqueducts also provided water for mining operations, milling, farms and gardens.|$|E
25|$|Ocean {{currents}} can {{transport water}} {{over thousands of}} kilometres, and may <b>bring</b> <b>water</b> with different temperature and salinity into a region. Some ocean currents have a huge effect on local climate, for instance the warm water of the North Atlantic drift moderates the climate of the north west coast of Europe. The speed of water movement can affect dive planning and safety.|$|E

Collins' body would be recovered two months later.|$|E

25|$|In 1684, Louis XIV {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of a château in the proximity of an aqueduct built to <b>bring</b> <b>water</b> drawn from the Seine by the Machine de Marly to the Château de Marly. The king gave the building to Baron Arnold de Ville, the engineer of Liège who had conceived the hydraulic installation. The building was later given to Louise-Françoise de Bourbon, the eldest legitimised daughter of Louis XIV and his mistress Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan.|$|E
25|$|Situated {{at the tip}} of a windswept {{peninsula}} {{without water}} or firewood, San Francisco lacked most of the basic facilities for a 19th-century settlement. These natural disadvantages forced the town's residents to <b>bring</b> <b>water,</b> fuel and food to the site. The first of many environmental transformations was the city's reliance on filled marshlands for real estate. Much of the present downtown is built over the former Yerba Buena Cove, granted to the city by military governor Stephen Watts Kearny in 1847.|$|E

25|$|An October 2011 report {{published}} in Nature states that Herschel measurements of deuterium {{levels in the}} comet Hartley 2 suggests that much of Earth's water could have initially come from cometary impacts. On 20 October 2011, {{it was reported that}} oceans-worth of cold water vapor had been discovered in the accretion disc of a young star.

25|$|The Greek {{philosophers}} {{were the}} earliest Western thinkers to address chance and randomness. Around 400 BC, Democritus presented {{a view of}} the world as governed by the unambiguous laws of order and considered randomness as a subjective concept that only originated from the inability of humans {{to understand the nature of}} events. He used the example of two men who would send their servants to <b>bring</b> <b>water</b> at the same time to cause them to meet.

25|$|In 1895 Lowell {{published}} a book titled Mars, which speculated about an arid, dying landscape, whose inhabitants built canals to <b>bring</b> <b>water</b> from the polar caps to irrigate the remaining arable land. This formed the most advanced scientific ideas about the conditions on the red planet available to Wells at the time The War of the Worlds was written, but the concept was later proved erroneous by more accurate observation of the planet, and later landings by Russian and American probes such as the two Viking missions, that found a lifeless world too cold for water to exist in its liquid state.|$|E
25|$|The P.snelleni queens rise {{at sunrise}} and stop their {{activities}} at sunset. The queens begin their activities only when their body temperature is high enough from receiving sunbeams. This may not occur right at sunrise, {{but in the}} later months when the temperature is higher, the queen can start her activities earlier. The behaviors of P. snelleni males and females are quite distinct. Males rest in the nest and beg the workers for food, occasionally visiting flowers. Females {{on the other hand}} have different behaviors. Females rarely leave the brood, only sometimes to <b>bring</b> <b>water</b> drops to ventilate the nest on hot days. Food regurgitation is observed among females.|$|E
25|$|The Romans {{were the}} first to exploit mineral {{deposits}} using advanced technology, especially the use of aqueducts to <b>bring</b> <b>water</b> from great distances to help operations at the pithead. Their technology is most visible at sites in Britain such as Dolaucothi where they exploited gold deposits with at least 5 long aqueducts tapping adjacent rivers and streams. They used the water to prospect for ore by unleashing a wave of water from a tank to scour away the soil and so reveal the bedrock with any veins exposed to sight. They used the same method (known as hushing) to remove waste rock, and then to quench hot rocks weakened by fire-setting.|$|E
