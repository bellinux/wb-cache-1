5|$|Molecular {{biology is}} the study of <b>biology</b> <b>at</b> the {{molecular}} level. This field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly those of genetics and biochemistry. Molecular biology is a study of the interactions of the various systems within a cell, including the interrelationships of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and how those interactions are regulated.|$|E
5|$|Plath {{was born}} on October 27, 1932, in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. Her mother, Aurelia Schober Plath (1906–1994), was a second-generation American of Austrian descent, and her father, Otto Plath (1885–1940), was from Grabow, Germany. Plath's father was an {{entomologist}} {{and a professor of}} <b>biology</b> <b>at</b> Boston University who authored a book about bumblebees.|$|E
5|$|Aniru Sahib Sahib Conteh {{was born}} on 6 August 1942, {{in the town of}} Jawi Folu, Eastern Province, Sierra Leone, the son of a farmer and chief of the village. He moved to Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, after his mother died while he was in his teens. Conteh studied {{chemistry}} and <b>biology</b> <b>at</b> Fourah Bay College and began teaching after receiving his BSc. In 1968, he began studying medicine in Nigeria at the modern University of Ibadan, graduating in 1974. Conteh spent the next four years employed by the Ibadan Teaching Hospital. He returned home to Sierra Leone in 1979. Conteh married and raised a family with his wife Sarah, producing several sons and daughters.|$|E

5|$|Born in Lawton, Oklahoma {{and raised}} in Anaheim, California, Hillenburg became fascinated with the ocean {{as a child and}} also {{developed}} an interest in art. He started his professional career in 1984, instructing marine <b>biology,</b> <b>at</b> the Orange County Marine Institute, where he wrote The Intertidal Zone, an informative comic book about tide-pool animals, which he used to educate his students. In 1989, two years after leaving teaching, Hillenburg enrolled at the California Institute of the Arts to pursue a career in animation. He was later offered a job on the Nickelodeon animated television series Rocko's Modern Life (19931996) after his success with short films The Green Beret and Wormholes (both 1992), which he made while studying animation.|$|E
5|$|Robert Bigham Brode {{was born}} in Walla Walla, Washington, on June 12, 1900, the son of Howard S. Brode, a {{professor}} of <b>biology</b> <b>at</b> Whitman College, and his wife Martha Catherine née Bigham. He was the second {{of a set of}} quadruplets, being born between his brothers Wallace and Malcolm, the fourth child died within weeks of being born. They also had an older brother, James Stanley. All four attended Whitman College, and went on to earn doctorates and have distinguished careers as scientists and academics.|$|E
5|$|Stebbins's Ph.D. {{was granted}} by Harvard in 1931. In March that year, he married Margaret Chamberlin, {{with whom he}} had three children. In 1932, he took a {{teaching}} position in <b>biology</b> <b>at</b> Colgate University. While at Colgate, he continued his work in cytogenetics; in particular, he continued to study the genetics of Antennaria and began to study the behaviour of chromosomes in hybrid peonies bred by biologist Percy Saunders. Saunders and Stebbins attended the 1932 International Congress of Genetics in Ithaca, New York. Here, Stebbins's interest was captured by talks given by Thomas Hunt Morgan and Barbara McClintock, who spoke about chromosomal crossover. Stebbins reproduced McClintock's crossover experiments in the peony, and published several papers on the cytogenetics of Paeonia, which established his reputation as a geneticist.|$|E

5|$|During the {{peregrine}} falcon decline, Houle studied <b>biology</b> <b>at</b> Colorado College in Colorado Springs. The institution's block scheduling system meant that Houle had fewer classes each day, {{allowing her to}} travel frequently to experience various ecosystems {{in addition to her}} academic studies. Upon leaving college, Houle began working for the Colorado Division of Wildlife, and her first field assignment was to observe {{peregrine falcon}} activity along the Rocky Mountains for four summers, two of which were spent at Chimney Rock. Following her experience with the peregrine falcons, Houle had to decide whether to continue pursuing wildlife biology or to commit instead to her passion of writing. Wings for My Flight combined both of Houle's interests; it recounted her observations of the peregrines as well as her interaction with the community at Chimney Rock during her first summer there.|$|E
5|$|German {{was first}} {{introduced}} into the curriculum in 1931, the same time at which the school began to offer voluntary after-school art classes. F. H. Taylor attempted to achieve equilibrium in the curriculum between arts and science subjects; he made woodwork and art continuous for an entire term and introduced a geography course for the Higher School Certificate. In 1948 rural biology {{was added to the}} curriculum for the first time, for which the headmaster provided a plot of land {{to be used as a}} vegetable plot. At the end of that year, an after-school study period was introduced; following the seven normal periods (five in the morning, two in the afternoon), students were to either begin their homework, or attend a school society. However, the 1950s saw a definite swing towards maths and science, and a subsequent increase in staffing in those departments. In 1957, zoology and botany was taught at A-level for the first time, and physics and chemistry replaced rural <b>biology</b> <b>at</b> O-level (now replaced by the GCSE).|$|E
5|$|However, some {{researchers}} have hypothesized that the reason the proportion of fatalities is low is not because sharks do not like human flesh, but because humans are often able to escape after the first bite. In the 1980s, John McCosker, Chair of Aquatic <b>Biology</b> <b>at</b> the California Academy of Sciences, noted that divers who dove solo and were bitten by great whites were generally at least partially consumed, while divers who followed the buddy system were generally rescued by their companion. McCosker and Timothy C. Tricas, an author and professor at the University of Hawaii, suggest that a standard pattern for great whites is to make an initial devastating attack and then wait for the prey to weaken before consuming the wounded animal. Humans' ability {{to move out of}} reach with the help of others, thus foiling the attack, is unusual for a great white's prey.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the Division of <b>Biology</b> <b>at</b> Caltech, the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (and its precursors) at Cambridge, {{and a handful of}} other institutions, the Pasteur Institute became a major center for molecular biology research in the late 1950s. Scientists at Cambridge, led by Max Perutz and John Kendrew, focused on the rapidly developing field of structural biology, combining X-ray crystallography with Molecular modelling and the new computational possibilities of digital computing (benefiting both directly and indirectly from the military funding of science). A number of biochemists led by Frederick Sanger later joined the Cambridge lab, bringing together the study of macromolecular structure and function. At the Pasteur Institute, François Jacob and Jacques Monod followed the 1959 PaJaMo experiment with a series of publications regarding the lac operon that established the concept of gene regulation and identified what came to be known as messenger RNA. By the mid-1960s, the intellectual core of molecular biology—a model for the molecular basis of metabolism and reproduction— was largely complete.|$|E
5|$|Philosophical Transactions is {{the oldest}} and longest-running {{scientific}} journal in the world, having first been published in March 1665 by the first secretary of the society, Henry Oldenburg. It now publishes themed issues on specific topics and, since 1886, has been divided into two parts; A, which deals with mathematics and the physical sciences, and B, which deals with the biological sciences. Proceedings of the Royal Society consists of freely submitted research articles and is similarly divided into two parts. Biology Letters publishes short research articles and opinion pieces on all areas of biology and was launched in 2005. Journal of the Royal Society Interface publishes cross-disciplinary research at {{the boundary between the}} physical and life sciences, while Interface Focus, publishes themed issue in the same areas. Notes and Records is the Society's journal on the history of science. Biographical Memoirs is published annually and contains extended obituaries of deceased Fellows. Open Biology is an open access journal covering <b>biology</b> <b>at</b> the molecular and cellular level. Royal Society Open Science is an open access journal publishing high-quality original research across the entire range of science on the basis of objective peer-review. All the society's journals are peer-reviewed.|$|E
