The model extends existing models for ocean Raman scattering to the UV spectral range. Ocean Raman scattering radiance is propagated through the atmosphere using a concept of the Lambert equivalent reflectivity and an accurate radiative transfer model for Rayleigh scattering.

In this paper we estimate cloud pressure from GOME observations in the 355 - 400 nm spectral range using the concept of a Lambertian-equivalent reflectivity (LER) surface. GOME has full spectral coverage in this range at relatively high spectral resolution with a very high signal-to-noise ratio. This allows for much more accurate estimates of cloud pressure than were possible with its predecessors SBUV and TOMS. We also demonstrate the potential capability to retrieve chlorophyll content with full-spectral <b>buv</b> <b>instruments.</b> We compare our retrieved LER cloud pressure with cloud top pressures derived from the infrared ATSR instrument on the same satellite. The findings confirm results from previous studies that showed retrieved LER cloud pressures from buv observations are systematically higher than IR-derived cloud-top pressure.

The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on the EOS Aura satellite provides new and improved capabilities for PMC characterization. OMI uses smaller pixels than previous <b>BUV</b> <b>instruments,</b> which increases its ability to identify PMCs and discern more spatial structure, and its wide cross-track viewing swath provides full polar coverage up to 90 latitude every day in both hemispheres. This cross-track coverage allows the evolution of PMC regions to be followed over several consecutive orbits.

It is shown, however, that the bulk of the correlation derives from the long-term decreasing trends in both data sets. When the long-term trends are removed, a cross-correlation analysis produces a maximum with no phase shift or with the ozone variations leading the solar variations by one month, thereby reducing the likelihood of a cause and effect relationship on time scales of this order. In view of the current uncertainty in the long-term stability of the <b>BUV</b> <b>instrument</b> and the resulting uncertainty in any long-term trend derived from its data, it is considered unrealistic to draw firm conclusions about a solar cycle influence on total ozone from this satellite data set...|$|E

The data have been processed through the new version 8 algorithm, which is designed to be more accurate and, more importantly, to reduce the influence of the a priori on ozone trends. As a part of the version 8 reprocessing we have attempted to apply a consistent calibration to the individual instruments so that their data records can be used together in a time series analysis. Validation consists of examining not only the mean difference from external datasets (i. e trends) but also consistency in the interannual variability of the data. Here we validate the v 8 BUV data through comparison with ECC sondes, lidar and microwave measurements, and with SAGE II and HALOE satellite data records. We find that individual profiles generally agree with external data sets within +/- 10 % between 30 hPa and 1 hPa (approx. 24 - 50 km) and frequently agree within +/- 5 %. The interannual variability of the BUV ozone time series agrees well with that of SAGE II. On the average, different B W instruments usually agree within +/- 5 % with each other, though the relative error increases near the ends of the Nimbus 7 and NOAA 16 data records as a result of instrument problems.

We show that validation of radiances from the ground can be a very effective means for correcting long term drifts of backscatter type satellite measurements and can be used to cross calibrate all <b>BUV</b> <b>instruments</b> in orbit (TOMS, SBUV/ 2, GOME, SCIAMACHY, OMI, GOME- 2, OMPS). This method bypasses the retrieval algorithms used to derive ozone products from both satellite and ground based measurements that are normally used to validate the satellite data. Radiance comparisons employ forward models, but they are inherently more accurate than the retrieval This method employs very accurate comparisons between ground based zenith sicy radiances and satellite nadir radiances and employs two well established capabilities at the Goddard Space Flight Center, 1) the SSBUV calibration facilities and 2) the radiative transfer codes used for the TOMS and SBUV/ 2 algorithms and their subsequent refinements. The zenith sky observations are made by the SSBUV where its calibration is maintained to a high degree of accuracy and precision. Radiative transfer calculations show that ground based zenith sky and satellite nadir backscatter ultraviolet comparisons can be made very accurately under certain viewing conditions. Initial ground observations taken from Goddard Space Flight Center compared with radiative transfer calculations has indicated the feasibility of this method. The effect of aerosols and varying ozone amounts are considered in the model simulations and the theoretical comparisons.

40|$|An {{overview}} {{is given}} of the Nimbus 7 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) {{which was designed}} to observe the spatial characteristics of total ozone that were not resolved by the nadir-viewing Nimbus <b>BUV</b> and SBUV <b>instruments.</b> At the wavelengths suitable for total ozone measurements, the radiance is large enough that the entire daytime atmosphere could be surveyed with about 50 -km resolution from a polar orbiting satellite. The resulting high spatial resolution TOMS ozone images are found to reflect the internal dynamic structure of the lower atmosphere. Features which can be identified and tracked include: planetary wave scale troughs and ridges, mesoscale cutoff lows and rapidly moving troughs, jet stream confluence and difluence areas, hurricanes, and polar night lows. These features control the ozone above any given location and account for nearly all the variance in the total ozone. The instrument has been used to track the volcanic eruption clouds from El Chichon, Mount St. Helens, Alaid, and smaller eruptions such as Galunggung. It would be feasible to use a similar instrument on a geostationary platform to obtain half-hourly maps.

In this paper we describe the basic principles of the "soft" calibration approach that we have successfully applied to the data from many of these instruments to produce a consistent long-term record of total ozone, ozone profile and aerosols. This approach is based on using accurate radiative transfer models and assumed/known properties of the atmosphere in ultraviolet to derive calibration parameters. Although the accuracy of the results inevitably depends upon how well the assumed atmospheric properties are known, the technique has several built-in cross- checks that improve the robustness of the method. To develop further confidence in the data the soft calibration technique can be combined with data collected from few well- calibrated ground-based instruments.

40|$|The fluxes {{of solar}} protons have been {{measured}} by satellites for over forty years (1963 -present). Eight Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP) satellites measured solar proton fluxes from 1963 - 1993 and five NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) {{were used for}} the period 1994 present. These high energy solar protons precipitate on the Earth's polar atmosphere sporadically, especially during solar proton events (SPEs), which typically last a few days. Solar protons with energies greater than 30 MeV are capable of reaching the stratosphere and causing increases in odd hydrogen (HOx) and odd nitrogen (NOy) constituents at polar latitudes (greater than 60 degrees geomagnetic). The enhanced HOx leads to short-lived ozone depletion (-days) due to the short lifetime of HOx constituents. The enhanced NOy leads to long-lived ozone changes because of the long lifetime of the NOy family in the stratosphere. Several very large SPEs (August 1972, August and October 1989, July and November 2000, September and November 2001, and October 2003) over the 1963 - 2004 time period were simulated in the GSFC two-dimensional chemistry and transport model and were predicted to cause significant polar upper stratospheric ozone depletion greater than 10 %, which lasted for several weeks past the events. Several satellite <b>instruments</b> (<b>BUV,</b> SBUV, SBW/ 2, SAGE II, HALOE, etc.) have shown constituent changes as a result of SPEs. Long-term (greater than 40 year) model simulations of the influence of the solar protons and satellite measurements during and after some of the very large SPEs will be shown...|$|R
40|$|Daily average {{solar proton}} flux {{data for the}} years 1963 - 1984 (two solar cycles) {{have been used in}} a proton energy {{degradation}} scheme to derive ion pair production rates and, subsequently, HOx (H, OH, HO 2) and NOx (N, NO, NO 2) production rates. These HOx and NOx production rates are computed in a form suitable for inclusion in an atmospheric two-dimensional time-dependent photochemical model. The HOx increases, although large for certain solar proton events (SPEs), are relatively short-lived because the HOx species have lifetimes of only hours in the middle atmosphere. For longer-lived NOx species, increases are important for 2 - 4 months past the more intense SPEs but are generally negligible 6 months after the SPE. The only exception to this scenario was the gigantic August 1972 SPE, whose stratospheric effects lasted about a year past the event. Comparisons of model results with the ozone data from the Nimbus 4 backscattered ultraviolet (<b>BUV)</b> <b>instrument</b> indicate relatively good agreement in the time dependence and magnitude of the ozone depletion for the middle stratosphere between the model and measurements for the August 1972 SPE and for 2 months past the event.

40|$|We have {{produced}} a profile merged ozone data set (MOD) based on the SBUV/SBUV 2 series of nadir-viewing satellite backscatter instruments, covering the period from November 1978 - December 2003. In 2004, data from the Nimbus 7 SBUV and NOAA 9, 11, and 16 SBUV/ 2 instruments were reprocessed using the Version 8 (V 8) algorithm and most recent calibrations. More recently, data from the Nimbus 4 <b>BUV</b> <b>instrument,</b> which operated from 1970 - 1977, were also reprocessed using the V 8 algorithm. As part of the V 8 profile calibration, the Nimbus 7 and NOAA 9 (1993 - 1997 only) instrument calibrations have been adjusted to match the NOAA 11 calibration, which was established from comparisons with SSBUV shuttle flight data. Given the level of agreement between the data sets, we simply average the ozone values during periods of instrument overlap to produce the MOD profile data set. We use statistical time-series analysis of the MOD profile data set (1978 - 2003) to estimate the change in profile ozone due to changing stratospheric chlorine levels. The Nimbus 4 BUV data offer an opportunity to test the physical properties of our statistical model. We extrapolate our statistical model fit backwards in time and compare to the Nimbus 4 data.

40|$|This year we {{are celebrating}} the 40 th {{anniversary of the}} launch of the Backscatter Ultraviolet (<b>BUV)</b> <b>{{instrument}}</b> on NASA's Nimbus- 4 satellite. The purpose of this instrument was to demonstrate the capability to measure total column ozone and its vertical distribution from space. The success of this instrument led to about a dozen instruments of this type on various NASA and NOAA satellites. These instruments used a single photomultiplier tube (PMT) that restricted the measurements to 6 - 12 discrete wavelengths in the 250 - 380 nm range. With the availability of solid-state detector arrays in the past decade it has been possible to make similar measurements but with hyperspectral (contiguous in wavelength) sampling and enhanced spectral resolution. This has allowed global mapping of several weakly-absorbing trace gases including S 0 2, NO 2, BrO, HCHO, and CIIOCHO. Since these measurements are affected by clouds and aerosols, a great deal of effort has gone into understanding their effect on ultraviolet radiation- both upwelling and downwelling. The downwelling UV radiation is chemically and biologically active and has both negative (genetic damage, air pollution) and positive (production of vitamin D and OH radical) environmental effects. I will discuss how the interaction of Rayleigh-scattered UV radiation with clouds and aerosols produce a variety of interesting effects that are leading to new methods of remote sensing of their properties. The UV measurements can greatly enhance the information that one derives from more traditional methods that use infrared and visible part of the solar spectrum...|$|E
40|$|The Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) {{instruments}} are spatially-scanning UV spectrometers that have produced daily global images of total ozone {{over the last}} 21 years since {{the launch of the}} Nimbus 7 satellite. The instruments use a total ozone retrieval algorithm pioneered by J. V. Dave and C. L. Mateer for the Nimbus 4 Backscatter Ultraviolet (<b>BUV)</b> <b>instrument,</b> designed by D. F. Heath. The TOMS ozone maps have revealed the relations between total ozone and atmospheric dynamics, and shown the dramatic losses of ozone in the Antarctic ozone hole and the Northern hemisphere. The accepted long-term trends in global, regional, and local ozone are derived from data from the Nimbus 7 TOMS and three successive TOMS flights on Russian, Japanese, and American satellites. The next TOMS flight will be launched in 2000. The contiguous mapping design and fortuitous choice of TOMS wavelengths bands also permitted imaging of a second atmospheric gas, sulfur dioxide, which is transient due to its short lifetime. The importance of this measurement was first realized after the eruption of El Chichon volcano in 1982. The extreme range of sizes of volcanic eruptions and the associated danger require observations from a distant observing platform. The first quantitative time series of the input of sulfur dioxide by explosive volcanic eruptions into the atmosphere thus was developed from the TOMS missions. Finally, the Rayleigh and aerosol scattering spectral characteristic and reflectivity complete the four dominant pieces of information in the near UV albedo of the Earth. The four parameters are derived with a linear algorithm, the absorption coefficients of the gases, and effective paths computed from radiative transfer tables. Absorbing aerosol clouds (smoke, dust, volcanic ash) are readily identified by their deviation from a Rayleigh signature. The greatest shortcoming of the TOMS dataset is the 24 hour time resolution that is produced by the polar orbit of the satellite. Dynamic phenomena, such as upper air fronts that modulate total ozone and volcanic eruptions of sulfur dioxide and ash, cannot be adequately resolved. It is hoped that UV observations from geostationary satellites will soon be made to test the value of this unique information in weather forecasting and aviation safety...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we present the {{validation}} of ozone profiles {{from a number of}} Solar Back Scattered Ultra Violet (SBUV) and SBUV/ 2 instruments that were recently reprocessed using an updated (Version 8. 6) algorithm. The SBUV dataset provides the longest available record of global ozone profiles, spanning a 41 -year period from 1970 to 2011 (except a 5 -year gap in the 1970 s) and includes ozone profile records obtained from the Nimbus- 4 BUV and Nimbus- 7 SBUV instruments, and a series of SBUV(/ 2) instruments launched on NOAA operational satellites (NOAA 09, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19). Although modifications in instrument design were made in the evolution from the <b>BUV</b> <b>instrument</b> to the modern SBUV(/ 2) model, the basic principles of the measurement technique and retrieval algorithm remain the same. The long term SBUV data record allows us to create a consistent, calibrated dataset of ozone profiles {{that can be used for}} climate studies and trend analyses. In particular, we focus on estimating the various sources of error in the SBUV profile ozone retrievals using independent observations and analysis of the algorithm itself. For the first time we include in the metadata a quantitative estimate of the smoothing error, defined as the error due to profile variability that the SBUV observing system cannot inherently measure. The magnitude of the smoothing error varies with altitude, latitude, season and solar zenith angle. Between 10 and 1 hPa the smoothing errors for the SBUV monthly zonal mean retrievals are of the order of 1 %, but start to increase above and below this layer. The largest smoothing errors, as large as 15 - 20 %, were detected in in the troposphere. The SBUV averaging kernels, provided with the ozone profiles in version 8. 6, help to eliminate the smoothing effect when comparing the SBUV profiles with high vertical resolution measurements, and make it convenient to use the SBUV ozone profiles for data assimilation and model validation purposes. The smoothing error can also be minimized by combining layers of data, and we will discuss recommendations for this approach as well. The SBUV ozone profiles have been intensively validated against satellite profile measurements obtained from the Microwave Limb Sounders (MLS) (on board the UARS and AURA satellites), Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) and Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS). Also, we compare coincident and collocated SBUV ozone retrievals with observations made by ground-based instruments, such as microwave spectrometers, lidars, Umkehr instruments and balloon-borne ozonosondes. Finally, we compare the SBUV ozone profiles with output from the NASA GSFC GEOS-CCM model. In the stratosphere between 25 and 1 hPa the mean biases and standard deviations are within 5 % for monthly mean ozone profiles. Above and below this layer the vertical resolution of the SBUV algorithm decreases and the effects of vertical smoothing should be taken into account. Though the SBUV algorithm has a coarser vertical resolution in the lower stratosphere and troposphere, it is capable of precisely estimating the integrated ozone column between the surface and 25 hPa. The time series of the tropospheric - lower stratospheric ozone column derived from SBUV agrees within 5 % with the corresponding values observed by an ensemble of ozone sonde stations in North Hemisphere. Drift of the ozone time series obtained from each SBUV(/ 2) instrument relative to ground based and satellite measurements are evaluated and some features of individual SBUV(l 2) instruments are discussed. In addition to evaluating individual instruments against independent observations, we also focus on the instrument to instrument consistency in the series. Overall, Version 8. 6 ozone profiles obtained from two different SBUV(l 2) instruments compare within a couple of percent during overlap periods and are consistently varying in time, with some exceptions. Some of the noted discrepancies might bssociated with ozone diurnal variations, since the difference in the local time of the observations for a pair of SBUV(l 2) instruments could be several hours. Other issues include the potential short-term drift in measurements as the instrument orbit drifts, and measurements are obtained at high solar zenith angles (> 85). Based on the results of the validation, a consistent, calibrated dataset of SBUV ozone profiles has been created based on internal calibration only...|$|E
