40|$|The Newzbin cases mark a clear {{shift in}} the {{responsibility}} that European based internet service providers must take in protecting intellectual property rights. Previously, that burden laid primarily with rights holders. Today, however, legislative bodies and courts in both the European Union and the United States have shifted the expectation of protections to a <b>shared</b> <b>burden</b> amongst internet service providers (ISPs) and rights holders. The SABAM case begins to outline and define the full parameters of that <b>shared</b> <b>burden.</b> However, numerous issues exist {{in relation to the}} amount of burden each party must undertake within this <b>shared</b> <b>burden</b> standard and to date few reasonable responses have been advanced to assist ISPs in living up to this <b>shared</b> <b>burden</b> without being subjected to additional costs and potential liability.

5000|$|Cumulative per-capita {{approaches}} define {{climate justice}} as the convergence of, not individual per-capita emissions, but rather per-capita emissions over time.

Chinese analysts, in particular, seem to see them as direct responses to per-capita proposals. Such an approach is reflected in the interest and recent popularity of the carbon debt approach to global climate justice. The aims of both the carbon debt campaign and the GDRs project are closely aligned.

50|$|Prussia {{was able}} to {{leverage}} the Protestant Church as a partner and ally in the setup of its educational system. Prussian ministers, particularly Karl Abraham Freiherr von Zedlitz, sought to introduce a more centralized, uniform system administered by the state during the 18th century. The implementation of the Prussian General Land Law of 1794 was a major step toward this goal. However, there remains in Germany to the present a complicated system of <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> between municipalities and state administration for primary and secondary education. The various confessions still have a strong say, contribute religious instruction as a regular topic in schools and receive state funding {{to allow them to}} provide preschool education and kindergarten. In comparison, the French and Austrian education systems faced major setbacks due to ongoing conflicts with the Catholic Church and its educational role. The introduction of compusory schooling in France was delayed till the 1880s.|$|E
5000|$|According to Sheldon Ungar's {{comparison}} with global warming, the {{actors in the}} ozone depletion case had {{a better understanding of}} scientific ignorance and uncertainties. The ozone case communicated to lay persons [...] "with easy-to-understand bridging metaphors derived from the popular culture" [...] and related to [...] "immediate risks with everyday relevance", while the public opinion on climate change sees no imminent danger. The stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based as well on successfully reducing regional <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> conflicts. In case of the IPCC conclusions and the failure of the Kyoto Protocol, varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions remain an unsolved problem. In the UK, a report for a House of Lords committee asked to urge the IPCC to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change but the Stern Review ordered by the UK government made a stronger argument in favor to combat human-made climate change.|$|E

40|$|Personality-disordered {{offenders}} are difficult individuals to manage, and knowledge about effective treatment is sparse. In the UK, novel forensic psychiatric services were recently {{established for the}} treatment of offenders with personality disorder. In this paper we report the clinical and economic findings from a 2 -year follow-up of a cohort of service users recruited from these services. Baseline information on developmental, clinical and offending histories was obtained from case records. Case records were checked at 6 and 24 months for new episodes of self-harm, violence, alcohol and substance use, and offending behaviour. Ratings of social functioning and therapeutic alliance were obtained from service users at baseline, 6 and 24 months. Fifty-six percent of service users were still engaged with the services at 24 -month follow-up. Service users involved in the greatest number of behavioural incidents had greater impairment in baseline social functioning and lower IQ scores. There was no significant change in either therapeutic alliance or social functioning at 6 or 24 months. The economic analysis showed that although the services were predominantly run by the Health Service, there were considerable economic <b>burdens</b> <b>shared</b> by other service providers. Treatment costs at six-month follow-up were also significantly higher. Implications are discussed...|$|R

50|$|When Streseman reshuffled {{his cabinet}} on 6 October 1923, Luther {{took over the}} Ministry of Finance and kept that {{portfolio}} in the two cabinets led by Wilhelm Marx which followed. Luther thus {{was in charge of}} the currency reform which ended the hyperinflation and introduced a new stable Mark. By 15 October, Luther presented a plan that combined elements of a reform by economist Karl Helfferich with ideas of Luther's predecessor Rudolf Hilferding. With the help of the emergency law (Ermächtigungsgesetz) of 13 October 1923 which gave the government the power to issue decrees on financial and economic matters, the plan was implemented that same day, 15 October 1923. The restrictive monetary policy by Hjalmar Schacht at the Reichsbank helped to stabilize the currency, as did steps taken by Luther to close the budget deficit. On the revenue side, he pushed through three emergency tax hikes, brought forward due dates for taxes, increased prepayments of assesed taxes, raised the sales tax, taxed inflation gains and reorganized the financial <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> between Reich and Länder. On the spending side, Luther managed a drastic cut in personnel costs - by reducing the number of Reich employees by almost 25% over four months, a freeze on promotions and fixing public salaries at a level lower than that of 1913.|$|E
5000|$|The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (a {{protocol}} to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer) {{is an international}} treaty {{designed to protect the}} ozone layer by phasing out the production of numerous substances that are responsible for ozone depletion. It was agreed on 16 September 1987, and entered into force on 1 January 1989, followed by a first meeting in Helsinki, May 1989. Since then, it has undergone eight revisions, in 1990 (London), 1991 (Nairobi), 1992 (Copenhagen), 1993 (Bangkok), 1995 (Vienna), 1997 (Montreal), 1998 (Australia), 1999 (Beijing) and 2016 (Kigali, adopted, but not in force). As a result of the international agreement, the ozone hole in Antarctica is slowly recovering. Climate projections indicate that the ozone layer will return to 1980 levels between 2050 and 2070. [...] Due to its widespread adoption and implementation it has been hailed as an example of exceptional international co-operation, with Kofi Annan quoted as saying that [...] "perhaps the single most successful international agreement to date has been the Montreal Protocol". In comparison, effective <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> and solution proposals mitigating regional conflicts of interest have been among the success factors for the ozone depletion challenge, where global regulation based on the Kyoto Protocol has failed to do so. In this case of the ozone depletion challenge, there was global regulation already being installed before a scientific consensus was established. Also, overall public opinion was convinced of possible imminent risks.|$|E
5000|$|Through his {{capacity}} as Chairman of the FCE, Dr. Rupesinghe also seeks to provide policy support to {{each step of}} the Sri Lankan peace process writing articles and issue papers, and participating in seminars and TV opinion programmes. This role supports continued public discussion of pertinent issues and allows for the sharing of expertise with key decisionmakers, stakeholders and fellow civil society organisations. Since his return to Sri Lanka after the signing of the ceasefire agreement {{between the government and the}} LTTE in 2002, he has also initiated the National AntiWar Front (NAWF), with a presence in all the districts of Sri Lanka. It has been engaged in public demonstrations, sitins and vigils, to call for peace and a negotiated solution to the country’s civil war. While his nationbuilding efforts are invaluable, Dr. Rupesinghe remains open to criticism from political circles and outside, levelled by those critical of his endeavours towards peace. He has encouraged open discussions with such individuals and groups and believes that transparency and dialogue is the only way of reaching a national consensus on the issue. One of his valuable contributions has been his theoretical and conceptual reflections on advancing early warning and conflict resolution; the role of third parties in the mediation of protracted internal conflicts; and an advanced concept of multitrack solutions to civil wars. The advocacy programme, which he created, was to persuade governments and international organisations to develop programmes for early warning, early action and develop coalitions and <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> in civil wars. [...] As part of this work in influencing policy, he contributed to the discussion and creating policy instruments on early warning systems with the European Union (EU) and the O.A.U, and sought to influence the policy debate in UK, Canada, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Denmark, Germany and Japan. In Japan, his efforts led to the formation of the Centre for Preventive Diplomacy.|$|E
