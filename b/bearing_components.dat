40|$|The {{motion error}} of {{assembled}} bearing {{depends on the}} geometric profile of <b>bearing</b> <b>components.</b> Therefore, {{it is crucial to}} establish the relationship between geometric error of <b>bearing</b> <b>components</b> and motion error of assembled bearing, which contributes to improving the rotational accuracy of assembled bearing in the design and machining of the bearing. The main purpose of this research is to propose an accurate method for predicting the radial runout of inner ring based on the geometrical constraint model of cylindrical roller bearings. In the geometrical constraint model, dimension and form errors in the inner raceway, the outer raceway, and rollers are considered, and the change of contact positions between the raceways and rollers caused by geometric errors of <b>bearing</b> <b>components</b> is taken into account. This method could predict the radial runout of inner ring after <b>bearing</b> <b>components</b> with geometric error are assembled. In order to testify the validity of the proposed prediction method, two particular cases in which the profiles of the inner raceway are circle and ellipse are selected, and the analysis algorithms for the radial runout of inner ring are derived. Two analytical results obtained from the analysis algorithms validate accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed prediction method...|$|E

First, a mathematical model is assumed to generate vibration signals from damaged <b>bearing</b> <b>components,</b> such as the inner-race, outer-race, and rolling elements. The process of decomposing vibration signals into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and extracting statistical features is introduced to develop a damage-sensitive parameter vector. Finally, PCA and Isomap algorithm are used to classify and visualize this parameter vector, to separate damage characteristics from healthy <b>bearing</b> <b>components.</b> Moreover, the PSO-based optimization algorithm improves the classification performance by selecting proper weightings for the parameter vector, to maximize the visualization effect of separating and grouping of parameter vectors in three-dimensional space...|$|E

40|$|Scoliosis is {{a spinal}} {{deformity}} characterised by lateral curvatures of the spine. It typically occurs during adolescence, but in rare incidences {{can occur in}} young children. In adolescents, if severe or progressive, surgical treatment {{in the form of}} spinal fusion using screw and rod constructs may take place. However, in younger patients the spine and lungs are still growing, therefore, fusion is not recommended before the age of eight years. For early onset scoliosis fusionless techniques are used, with the current gold standard being traditional growing rods, incorporating pedicle screws and rods, which are periodically lengthened through frequent surgical interventions. Due to the number surgeries throughout the treatment period, this treatment suffers from high complication rates. As this treatment is far from ideal, alternative treatments are being explored to reduce these issues. This thesis describes the initial development of an alternative implant for the treatment of early onset scoliosis to alleviate the issues of traditional growing rods. The implant was based on a pedicle screw and rod system, but incorporated a <b>bearing</b> <b>component</b> to allow free extension of the construct without the need for further surgery. The development of the implant design was achieved through finite element analysis of individual components and of constructs using contact conditions. It was initially intended to use a UHMWPE <b>bearing</b> <b>component</b> incorporating a crosslink and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V sliding rod, with a commercially available pedicle screw. However, issues of the construct size lead {{to the development of a}} novel screw design incorporating an alumina bearing, a decoupled crosslink and CoCrMo sliding rod. The results of the finite element analysis show that an implant incorporating an alumina <b>bearing</b> <b>component</b> is a promising area for development, however, additional investigations of the construct are still required...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} fixed- and mobile-bearing {{implants}} were simulated using a multibody dynamic model and a {{finite element model}} to investigate the contact pressure distribution in the {{ultra high molecular weight}} polyethylene tibial <b>bearing</b> <b>component.</b> The thickness of polyethylene varied from 6. 8 to 12. 3 mm and the polyethylene was modelled as a non-linear material. It was found that the contact pressure on the polyethylene decreased in the fixed-bearing implant when the thickness of polyethylene increased from 6. 8 to 8 and 9. 6 mm, but there was little further decrease in pressure with the increase of polyethylene thickness from 9. 6 to 11. 0 and 12. 3 mm. In the mobile-bearing implant, no increase in contact pressure on the superior surface was found with the increase in the thickness of the polyethylene; however, the contact pressures on the inferior contact surface of the thicker designs were higher than those in the 6. 8 mm design. The numerical results obtained in this paper are in good agreement with published experimental test results. Moreover, the paper presents a detailed pressure dis-tribution on the tibial <b>bearing</b> <b>component</b> during a full gait cycle...|$|R
