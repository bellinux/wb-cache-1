500|$|In September 2004, Paige began {{a weekly}} Sunday {{afternoon}} radio show, Elaine Paige on Sunday, between 1 and 3 PM on BBC Radio2, featuring music from musical theatre and film. The 400th edition was broadcast on Sunday 29 July 2012. In an unfavourable review, {{the show was}} described by Elisabeth Mahoney of The Guardian as [...] "a chilly, alienating listening experience" [...] and a [...] "rare wrong move" [...] {{on the part of}} Radio2. Lisa Martland of The Stage agreed that [...] "it is by far the music that <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> back to the programme... and not her lightweight presenting style". However, the show regularly attracts 3million listeners, and interviews are also featured each week. Paige also focused on television appearances, playing Dora Bunner in the 2005 ITV adaptation of Agatha Christie's A Murder Is Announced in the Marple series, before performing a guest role as a post mistress in Where the Heart Is. The episode of Marple was watched by 7.78million viewers.|$|E
500|$|Israel entered one golfer {{into the}} Olympic tournament. Laetitia Beck (world no. 237) {{qualified}} directly {{among the top}} 60 eligible players for the women's event based on the International Golf Federation (IGF) World Rankings as of 11 July 2016. This {{marked the first time}} Israel sent a golfer to the Olympics. Due to Israel's inexperience representing golf athletes, Beck was required to procure all of her equipment to prepare for Rio, such as her uniform and hats. Israel's Olympic committee reimbursed her for the equipment. [...] On the topic of representing Israel at the Olympics, Beck said [...] "I think its because of what my grandparents had to go through, not just my grandparents but everyone during World War II, all the Jewish people during World War II and the holocaust, that obviously <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> anger, but i think what i'm trying to do is bring the anger and try to do something meaningful." [...] Beck finished tied for 31st with a score of two over par. Her best round was the third round, where she was tied for 13th place.|$|E
500|$|Both troubadours and trobairitz {{wrote of}} fin' amors, or courtly love. Women were {{generally}} {{the subject of}} the writings of troubadours, however: [...] "No other group of poets give women so exalted a definition within so tightly circumscribed a context of female suppression." [...] The tension between the suppression of women present in the poetry of the troubadours and similar themes in the poetry of the trobairitz is a major source of discussion for modern commentators. Trobairitz poetry pertaining to love tended to offer a less idealized conception of the subject than the poetry of their male counterparts, with a more conversational and less flourished style of writing intended to more closely emulate a more grounded vision of relationships. The trobairitz wrote in the canso (strophic song) and tenso (debate poem) genres. Besides cansos and tensos, trobairitz also wrote sirventes (political poems), planh (lament), salut d’ amor (a love letter not in strophic form), alba (dawn songs), and balada (dance songs). Judging by what survives today, the trobairitz wrote no pastorelas or malmariee songs, unlike their troubadour counterparts. Furthermore, in keeping with the troubadour tradition, the trobairitz closely linked the action of the singing to the action of loving. Comtessa de Dia demonstrates this in her poem Fin ioi me don'alegranssa, stating that [...] "Fin ioi me dona alegranssa/per qu'eu chan plus gaiamen," [...] translated as [...] "Happiness <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> pure joy/which makes me sing more cheerfully." ...|$|E

500|$|For the collaboration, Fraser McAlpine from BBC Radio 1 {{reviewed}} the song negatively, writing: [...] "So anyway, this <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> to 'Video Phone' – {{and what exactly}} is the point of Gaga featuring in this song? I know Beyoncé fans won't like me saying this, but I can't help but think that in this instance it's a case of 'if you can't beat em, join em' [...] For someone as naturally brilliant as Beyoncé (and a better singer than Gaga and Rihanna put together), perhaps she should actually stop trying so hard and do what she does best - singing proper songs." [...] Chris Willman from Yahoo! compared the song to Gaga's [...] "Telephone", where Knowles appears as a featured artist, and wrote that [...] "Maybe it's because the lack of a video for Gaga's [...] "Telephone" [...] leaves more to the imagination, but if this were a contest, I'd have to say her tune trumps Beyoncé's. [...] greatest promises of unbridled exhibitionism can't quite make the genre feel fresh." [...] The New York Times Jon Caramanica commented that [...] "Video Phone" [...] and [...] "Telephone", [...] "promised a new direction, but all Beyoncé did was show up to prove she could out-Gaga Gaga, then return to her comfort zone." [...] Kyle Anderson of MTV, felt that [...] "Gaga got a bit lost in the mix" [...] of [...] "Video Phone". David Balls of the website Digital Spy gave a negative review for the remix version, grading it two out of five stars. He further commented, ...|$|E
500|$|On May 10, Giuliani held what The New York Times {{described}} as an [...] "extraordinary, emotional news conference" [...] in Bryant Park to announce that he was seeking a separation from Hanover, saying, [...] "This is very, very painful. For quite some time it's probably been apparent that Donna and I lead in many ways independent and separate lives." [...] Regarding Nathan, Giuliani said [...] "I'm going to need her now more than maybe I did before", making reference to his battle with cancer and her background in nursing. Regarding the senate race, he again did not commit to a decision, saying, [...] "I don't really care about politics right now. [...] I'm thinking about my family, the people that I love {{and what can be}} done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best. [...] I'm not thinking about politics. Politics comes at least second, maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all work itself out some way politically." [...] Giuliani had, however, neglected to inform Hanover in advance of his announcement; her reaction was {{described as}} distraught. [...] Three hours later, she held her own news conference at Gracie Mansion, where she said, [...] "Today's turn of events <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> great sadness. I had hoped to keep this marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with one staff member." [...] In this, she was making reference to Cristyne Lategano, the former communications director for Giuliani; Vanity Fair had reported in 1997 that Lategano and Giuliani were having an affair, which both of them had denied. [...] Hanover continued, [...] "Beginning last May, I made a major effort to bring us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of our personal intimacy through the fall. At that point, he chose another path." ...|$|E
500|$|Featured music {{includes}} The Dixie Chicks' [...] "Lullaby", Tegan and Sara's [...] "Take Me Anywhere", Sleeping at Last's [...] "Quicksand", Emilíana Torrini's [...] "Nothing <b>Brings</b> <b>Me</b> Down", Gnarls Barkley's [...] "Gone Daddy Gone", Grant Lee Phillips's [...] "Under the Milky Way" [...] and Matt Kearney's [...] "All I Need". Rhimes {{disclosed that}} the main concept for the episode was to [...] "go in places the audience can imagine, but doesn't expect", {{in an attempt to}} [...] "freshen up" [...] the series for the new season. Rhimes stated that she originally planned to move the timeline three months after the conclusion of the second season, but the process did not occur, due to her not wanting the audience to miss significant moments from the character's complex lives. [...] "I feel like so much happened {{at the end of last}} season that I owe it to the characters to have them deal with the aftermath. And I owe it to the audience to let them watch the aftermath", stated Rhimes, in response to her decision to continue the storyline from where the previous season left off. Rhimes also described the prominence which Grey's underwear has in the first episode of the season, noting how they are [...] "a key element" [...] in the development of her character: [...] "Meredith never put them back on. She rushed out to deal with Izzie and left Derek who was asking what that meant, and she never had a chance to put those panties back on." [...] Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rhimes described it as achieving a balance between the aftermath of the recent events and the past experiences that define each character. In addition, she noted how the episode marked the transition to a new chapter in the personal backgrounds of the protagonists, stating: [...] "It was mean to bring us to a place where we can say goodbye to Denny, as well as deal with Meredith's love triangle. Just remember that nothing is ever wrapped up easily on this show. Because things aren't neat and clean in real life." ...|$|E

Yeager and Glennis moved to Grass Valley, California, after his retirement from the Air Force in 1975. The couple prospered because of Yeager's best-selling autobiography, speaking engagements and commercial ventures. Glennis Yeager died of ovarian cancer in 1990. They had four children (Susan, Don, Mickey and Sharon).|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} shot in a Scots Pine forest {{situated}} in the Guadarrama mountain range, Central Spain. Guillermo Navarro, the director of photography, said that [...] "after doing work in Hollywood on other movies and with other directors, working in our original language in different scenery <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> {{back to the original}} reasons I wanted to make movies, which is basically to tell stories with complete freedom and to let the visuals really contribute to the telling of the story".|$|E
2500|$|By November 1979, Hines {{had fallen}} out with Wizard Records' owner Robie Porter, {{and moved on to}} the Midnight label under Warner Music Australia, after waiting out her {{contract}} she returned to recording to achieve a few more hits including the dance track version of Dusty Springfield's [...] "Your Love Still <b>Brings</b> <b>Me</b> to My Knees", which reached Top Ten in 1981. A compilation Greatest Hits, released by Porter's Wizard Records, peaked at number 2 in January 1982. In April 1981, Hines' brother Dwight committed suicide, and Hines later recalled being given the news by her mother.|$|E
2500|$|Norfolk is {{the home}} county of Deaf Havana {{and many of the}} songs on Fools and Worthless Liars focus on the members childhoods' in the area. [...] "Hunstanton Pier" [...] is about the town of Hunstanton, where James Veck-Gilodi and bassist Lee Wilson went to school. 'It <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> back to the only place I ever really felt at home, and how much I miss it. It's hard for me to sing {{sometimes}} because it leads my mind to wander off and think about all the people I used to be so close to and what they are doing now'. [...] "Youth In Retrospect" [...] also deals with nostalgia and is again particularly personal to Veck-Gilodi and Lee Wilson. James has revealed that he is 'constantly battling with the fact that I'm constantly growing older' and how the pair 'wish we could go back to the days where... our biggest worry was whether our maths homework would be in on time'. [...] "Times Change, Friends Leave and Life Doesn't Stop For Anybody" [...] is about former member Ryan Mellor, with whom James has been friends since they were 14. 'This song is just, I suppose, about how much we miss him'.|$|E

2500|$|Groucho {{maintained}} his irrepressible {{sense of humor}} to the very end, however. [...] George Fenneman, his radio and TV announcer, good-natured foil, and lifelong friend, often related a story {{of one of his}} final visits to Groucho's home: When the time came to end the visit, Fenneman lifted Groucho from his wheelchair, put his arms around his torso, and began to [...] "walk" [...] the frail comedian backwards across the room towards his bed. As he did, he heard a weak voice in his ear: [...] "Fenneman," [...] whispered Groucho, [...] "you always were a lousy dancer." [...] When a nurse approached him with a thermometer during his final hospitalization, explaining that she wanted to see if he had a temperature, he responded, [...] "Don't be silly—everybody has a temperature." [...] Actor Elliott Gould recalled a similar incident: [...] "I recall the last time I saw Groucho, he was in the hospital, and he had tubes in his nose and what have you," [...] he said. [...] "And when he saw me, he was weak, but he was there; and he put his fingers on the tubes and played them like it was a clarinet. Groucho played the tubes for me, which <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> to tears." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Springfield {{released}} two albums on United Artists Records. The first was 1978's It Begins Again, produced by Roy Thomas Baker. The album peaked in the UK top 50 and was well received by critics. Her 1979 album, Living Without Your Love, {{did not reach}} the top50. In early 1979, Springfield played club dates in New York City. In London, she recorded two singles with David Mackay for her UK label, Mercury Records (formerly Philips Records). The first was the disco-influenced [...] "Baby Blue", co-written by Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes which reached No. 61 in the UK. The second, [...] "Your Love Still <b>Brings</b> <b>Me</b> to My Knees", released in January 1980, was Springfield's final single for Mercury Records; she had been with them for nearly 20 years. On 3 December 1979, she performed a charity concert for a full house at the Royal Albert Hall, {{in the presence of}} Princess Margaret. In 1980 Springfield sang [...] "Bits and Pieces", the theme song from the movie The Stunt Man. She signed a US deal with 20th Century Records, which resulted in the single [...] "It Goes Like It Goes", a cover of the Oscar-winning song from the film, Norma Rae. Springfield was uncharacteristically proud of her 1982 album White Heat, which was influenced by new wave music. She tried to revive her career in 1985 by returning to the UK and signing to Peter Stringfellow's Hippodrome Records label. This resulted in the single [...] "Sometimes Like Butterflies" [...] and an appearance on Terry Wogan's TV chat show, Wogan. None of Springfield's recordings from 1971 to 1986 charted on the UK Top40 or Billboard Hot100.|$|E
