5|$|BA {{was created}} in 1974 after a <b>British</b> Airways Board was {{established}} by the <b>British</b> government to manage the two nationalised airline corporations, <b>British</b> Overseas Airways Corporation and <b>British</b> European Airways, and two regional airlines, Cambrian Airways from Cardiff, and Northeast Airlines from Newcastle upon Tyne. On 31 March 1974, all four companies were merged to form <b>British</b> Airways. After almost 13 years as a state company, BA was privatised in February 1987 {{as part of a}} wider privatisation plan by the Conservative government. The carrier expanded with the acquisition of <b>British</b> Caledonian in 1987, Dan-Air in 1992, and <b>British</b> Midland International in 2012.|$|E
5|$|A <b>British</b> mission led by Akers {{assisted}} {{in the development of}} gaseous diffusion technology at the SAM Laboratories in New York. Another, headed by Mark Oliphant, assisted with that of the electromagnetic separation process at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Cockcroft became the director of the joint British-Canadian Montreal Laboratory. A <b>British</b> mission to the Los Alamos Laboratory was led by Chadwick, and later Peierls, which included several of Britain's most eminent scientists. As overall head of the <b>British</b> Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership, and ensured that <b>British</b> participation was complete and wholehearted.|$|E
5|$|A privately {{organised}} <b>British</b> team, {{which later}} became the <b>British</b> and Irish Lions, toured New Zealand in 1888. No test matches were played, and the side only played provincial sides. The <b>British</b> players were drawn mainly from Northern England, but there were representatives from Wales and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|After a {{full day}} of pursuit, the leading French ships made an attempt to cut off , {{trailing}} in the <b>British</b> rear. Cornwallis dropped back to support Mars, while Captain Robert Stopford of HMS Phaeton began making signals implying a <b>British</b> fleet was in sight. When French lookouts spotted distant topsails, Villaret de Joyeuse decided that Cornwallis's actions meant that a <b>British</b> fleet was approaching to support him, and called off the pursuit. There was no <b>British</b> fleet in the vicinity; the topsails were those of a convoy of <b>British</b> merchantmen.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} a virtual stalemate {{with these two}} wars against the Afghans, the <b>British</b> imposed the Durand Line in 1893, which divided Afghanistan and <b>British</b> India (now the North-West Frontier Province, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (F.A.T.A.) and Balochistan provinces of Pakistan). Named after Sir Mortimer Durand, the foreign secretary of the <b>British</b> Indian government, it was agreed upon by the Emir of Afghanistan (Abdur Rahman Khan) and {{the representatives of the}} <b>British</b> Empire but deeply resented by the Afghans. Its intended purpose was to serve as a buffer zone to inhibit the spread of Russian influence down into <b>British</b> India.|$|E
5|$|After the 52nd (Lowland), the 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions {{and nine}} <b>British</b> {{infantry}} battalions {{from each of}} the 10th, 53rd, 60th and 75th Divisions were sent to France between May and August 1918, the remaining <b>British</b> infantry battalions were reinforced by <b>British</b> Indian Army battalions. Infantry brigades were now reorganised with one <b>British</b> battalion and three <b>British</b> Indian Army battalions, {{with the exception of one}} brigade in the 53rd Division which had one South African and three Indian battalions. The <b>British</b> Indian Army's 7th (Meerut) Division arrived from the campaign in Mesopotamia in January 1918, followed by the 3rd (Lahore) Division in April 1918. Only the 54th (East Anglian) Division remained, as previously, an all <b>British</b> division.|$|E
5|$|After the {{effective}} {{completion of the}} evacuation, {{the mandate of the}} <b>British</b> forces began to expand. They assisted with the evacuation of besieged peacekeepers—including several <b>British</b> ceasefire observers—and began to assist the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and the Sierra Leone Army (SLA). Despite the mission expansion, it was not until 17 May that <b>British</b> soldiers came into direct contact with the RUF. The rebels attacked a <b>British</b> position near Lungi airport, but were forced to retreat after a series of firefights. On the same day, the RUF's leader, Foday Sankoh, was captured by Sierra Leonean forces, leaving the RUF in disarray. After deciding that the RUF would not disarm voluntarily, the <b>British</b> began training the SLA for a confrontation. During the training mission, a patrol returning from a visit to Jordanian peacekeepers was taken captive by a militia group known as the West Side Boys. Negotiations achieved the release of five of the eleven soldiers, and three weeks into the crisis, <b>British</b> special forces launched a mission codenamed Operation Barras, freeing the remaining six. The success of Operation Barras restored confidence in the <b>British</b> mission; one academic suggested that its failure would have forced the <b>British</b> government to withdraw all its forces from Sierra Leone.|$|E
5|$|Although a <b>British</b> frigate {{squadron}} under Josias Rowley {{was under}} orders {{to eliminate the}} French raiders, Rowley was distracted by the planned invasion of Île Bonaparte, which began the following week. Combined with limited <b>British</b> resources in the region, this allowed the French frigates significant freedom to attack <b>British</b> interests across the Ocean. The attack on Île Bonaparte was however part of a wider <b>British</b> strategy to seize and capture French raiding bases, {{and the success of}} the operation severely limited future French operations as Hamelin's squadron was required for the defence of Île de France. As a result, this was the last successful attack on a <b>British</b> merchant convoy in the Indian Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the primary}} {{role of the}} <b>British</b> Army was to protect the colonies against {{external}} attack, no actual threat ever materialised. The <b>British</b> Army was instead used in policing, guarding convicts at penal institutions, combating bushranging, putting down convict rebellions—as occurred at Bathurst in 1830—and to suppress Aboriginal resistance to the extension of European settlement. Notably <b>British</b> soldiers {{were involved in the}} battle at the Eureka Stockade in 1854 on the Victorian goldfields. Members of <b>British</b> regiments stationed in Australia also saw action in India, Afghanistan, New Zealand and the Sudan.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{facet of}} the <b>British</b> and American frontier was a system of forts built by the military. The forts provided safe shelter for soldiers and explorers on the frontier and a base of operations for expeditions, both military and commercial. The first forts in the area had been French, particularly Fort Beauharnois, built during the 18th century and later abandoned because of the French and Indian War with the <b>British.</b> <b>British</b> Fort Charlotte at Grand Portage became essential to the fur trade protecting and supplying <b>British</b> traders {{as well as the}} area natives. This <b>British</b> fort operated in the area (illegally) until 1803, even after the area's becoming recognized as part of the United States. Other French and <b>British</b> fortifications, such as Fort St. Charles, had existed in the region but had been abandoned much earlier.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of its}} {{establishment}} in 1973, the <b>British</b> Library absorbed the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (NLL), based near Boston Spa in Yorkshire, which had been established in 1961. Before this, the site had housed a World War II Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Thorp Arch, which closed in 1957. When the NLL {{became part of the}} <b>British</b> Library in 1973 it changed its name to the <b>British</b> Library Lending Division, in 1985 it was renamed as the <b>British</b> Library Document Supply Centre and is now known as the <b>British</b> Library Document Supply Service, often abbreviated as BLDSS.|$|E
5|$|As the Seven Years' War entered its {{later stages}} through 1758 and 1759, French forces and colonies in northeastern North America came under renewed attacks from <b>British</b> armies. In 1758 after defeat in July at the Battle of Carillon, the <b>British</b> took Louisbourg in August, causing Atlantic Canada {{to fall into}} <b>British</b> hands, and opening the sea route to attack Quebec. Fort Frontenac fell to the <b>British</b> in the same month, costing the French {{supplies}} for the Ohio Valley campaign. When some of the Indian supporters of the French made peace with the <b>British,</b> France was forced to draw its troops back. French leadership, specifically Governor de Vaudreuil and General Montcalm, were unsettled by the <b>British</b> successes. However, Quebec {{was still able to}} protect itself as the <b>British</b> prepared a three-pronged attack for 1759.|$|E
5|$|At 05:00 {{the leading}} <b>British</b> ship, HMS Monarch, was within range {{and opened fire}} on the French squadron, which divided. One frigate went north and was intercepted by HMS Mars, while another, {{accompanied}} by the two corvettes, turned south and managed to outrun HMS Windsor Castle. The {{main body of the}} French force remained together and met the attack of Monarch and the <b>British</b> flagship HMS Centaur with their broadsides. Although outnumbered and outclassed by the <b>British</b> squadron the French ships fought hard, inflicting damage on the leading <b>British</b> ships and severely wounding Commodore Hood. Eventually the strength of the <b>British</b> squadron told, and despite a fierce resistance the French ships surrendered one by one, the <b>British</b> capturing four of the seven vessels in the squadron.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1944, Ron Jeffery, an agent of <b>British</b> and Polish intelligence in occupied Poland, eluded the Abwehr and travelled to London with a report from Poland to the <b>British</b> government. His efforts were at first highly regarded, but subsequently ignored by the <b>British,</b> which a disillusioned Jeffery attributed to the treachery of Kim Philby and other high-ranking communist agents entrenched in the <b>British</b> system. Jeffery tried to inform the <b>British</b> government about the Katyn massacre, but was as a result released from the Army.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War all the <b>British</b> Army, Royal Navy, Royal Air Force, {{and some}} Royal Marines Commandos were disbanded, leaving only three Royal Marines Commandos and one brigade (with {{supporting}} Army elements). As of 2010 the <b>British</b> Commando force is 3 Commando Brigade, which consists of both Royal Marines and <b>British</b> Army components, as well as commando-trained personnel from the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Other units of the <b>British</b> armed forces that can trace their origins to the <b>British</b> Commandos of the Second World War are the Parachute Regiment, the Special Air Service, and the Special Boat Service.|$|E
5|$|Before the Spring Offensive on the Western Front began, the War Office {{had decided}} to {{substitute}} <b>British</b> units in the EEF with <b>British</b> Indian Army units. The relieved <b>British</b> units were to be retained in Egypt as reinforcements. When the Spring Offensive was launched these <b>British</b> units were quickly redeployed to the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Bitterness {{between the}} Assyrians and the Arabs was {{reported}} by <b>British</b> historians {{as far back as}} 1920. This was made worse by the <b>British</b> officers of the levies who encouraged the Assyrians to think that they were first-class troops, which had the effect of increasing the natural pride of the Assyrians. This, coupled {{with the fact that the}} <b>British</b> and Assyrian levies succeeded in suppressing Kurdish revolts when the Iraqi Army failed created an inferiority complex among some Iraqi corps towards the <b>British</b> and the Assyrians.|$|E
5|$|<b>British</b> Columbia has 50district {{municipalities}} {{that had}} a cumulative population of770,148 in the 2016 Census. <b>British</b> Columbia's largest and smallest district municipalities are Langley and Wells with populations of 117,285 and 217 respectively. The fastest-growing district municipality in <b>British</b> Columbia is Invermere, which grew 14.8% between 2011 and 2016, while the fastest-shrinking is Tumbler Ridge, which shrunk by 26.7%.|$|E
5|$|<b>British</b> Pacific Fleet – An {{analogous}} {{situation in}} World War II where a <b>British</b> and Commonwealth force was amalgamated into the United States Pacific Fleet in 1945.|$|E
5|$|<b>British</b> consuls in the United States {{sought to}} enlist Americans for the Crimean War in 1854, in {{violation}} of neutrality laws, and Pierce eventually expelled minister Crampton and three consuls. To the President's surprise, the <b>British</b> did not expel Buchanan in retaliation. In his December 1855 message to Congress Pierce had set forth the American case that Britain had violated the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty. The <b>British,</b> according to Buchanan, were impressed by the message and were rethinking their policy. Nevertheless, Buchanan was not successful in getting the <b>British</b> to renounce their Central American possessions. The Canadian treaty was ratified by Congress, the <b>British</b> Parliament, and by the colonial legislatures in Canada.|$|E
5|$|<b>British</b> {{cultural}} {{influence on}} the island is evident in its use of English as the main language and the <b>British</b> pound as its primary currency. Additional cultural commonalities include driving on the left, access to the BBC and ITV regions, a school curriculum following that of England, and the popularity of <b>British</b> sports, including football, cricket and rugby.|$|E
5|$|<b>British</b> {{documents}} {{show that the}} <b>British</b> government was shaken by satyagraha. Nonviolent protest left the <b>British</b> confused {{about whether or not}} to jail Gandhi. John Court Curry, a <b>British</b> police officer stationed in India, wrote in his memoirs that he felt nausea every time he dealt with Congress demonstrations in 1930. Curry and others in <b>British</b> government, including Wedgwood Benn, Secretary of State for India, preferred fighting violent rather than nonviolent opponents.|$|E
5|$|<b>British</b> ice hockey's {{structure}} underwent major reorganisation in 1996. The <b>British</b> Hockey League (the highest senior competition since 1982, {{featuring the}} top two divisions of the sport) was disbanded and replaced by the Ice Hockey Superleague (top tier) and <b>British</b> National League (second tier).|$|E
5|$|<b>British</b> {{military}} forces in Kenya were {{made aware of the}} revolution at 4:45am on 12 January, and following a request from the Sultan were put on 15 minutes' standby to conduct an assault on Zanzibar's airfield. However, the <b>British</b> High Commissioner in Zanzibar, Timothy Crosthwait, reported no instances of <b>British</b> nationals being attacked and advised against intervention. As a result, the <b>British</b> troops in Kenya were reduced to four hours' standby later that evening. Crosthwait decided not to approve an immediate evacuation of <b>British</b> citizens, as many held key government positions and their sudden removal would further disrupt the country's economy and government. To avoid possible bloodshed, the <b>British</b> agreed a timetable with Karume for an organised evacuation.|$|E
5|$|<b>British</b> {{relations}} were also difficult with the nominally conquered Acadians. They resisted repeated <b>British</b> demands to swear oaths to the <b>British</b> crown, and eventually this sparked an exodus by the Acadians to Île-Royale and Île-Saint-Jean (present-day Prince Edward Island). By the 1740s, French {{leaders such as}} Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre orchestrated a guerrilla war with their Mi'kmaq allies against <b>British</b> attempts to expand Protestant settlements in peninsular Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|By 1779, Haider Ali had {{captured}} parts of modern Tamil Nadu and Kerala in the south, extending the Kingdom's area to about 80,000mi² (205,000km²). In 1780, he befriended the French and {{made peace with}} the Marathas and the Nizam. However, Haider Ali was betrayed by the Marathas and the Nizam, who made treaties with the <b>British</b> as well. In July 1779 Haider Ali headed an army of 80,000, mostly cavalry, descending through the passes of the Ghats amid burning villages, before laying siege to <b>British</b> forts in northern Arcot starting the Second Anglo-Mysore War. Haider Ali had some initial successes against the <b>British</b> notably at Pollilur, the worst defeat the <b>British</b> suffered in India until Chillianwala, and Arcot, until the arrival of Sir Eyre Coote, when {{the fortunes of the}} <b>British</b> began to change. On 1 June 1781 Sir Eyre Coote struck the first heavy blow against Haider Ali in the decisive Battle of Porto Novo. The battle was won by Sir Eyre Coote against odds of five to one, and is {{regarded as one of the}} greatest feats of the <b>British</b> in India. It was followed up by another hard-fought battle at Pollilur (the scene of an earlier triumph of Haider Ali over a <b>British</b> force) on 27 August, in which the <b>British</b> won another success, and by the rout of the Mysore troops at Sholinghur a month later. Haider Ali died on 7 December 1782, even as fighting continued with the <b>British.</b> He was succeeded by his son Tipu Sultan who continued hostilities against the <b>British</b> by recapturing Baidanur and Mangalore.|$|E
5|$|By 1800, the <b>British</b> and French {{had been}} at war for seven years and the <b>British</b> {{dominated}} the sea, following {{a number of significant}} victories over the French, Dutch and Spanish fleets. Off every French port, large squadrons of <b>British</b> ships of the line and frigates awaited French movements and whenever possible intercepted and destroyed French merchant vessels and warships. While <b>British</b> trading ships travelled in large, well-armed convoys, French ships were forced to slip between harbours to avoid the <b>British</b> blockade. To counter <b>British</b> control of the seas, the French periodically despatched squadrons of ships to raid <b>British</b> trade lanes, particularly off West Africa and in the South Atlantic, where the stretched Royal Navy maintained only minimal forces.|$|E
5|$|By 1806, the French {{squadron}} under Rear-Admiral Charles Linois {{departed for}} the Atlantic Ocean and a <b>British</b> expeditionary force captured the Cape of Good Hope. Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew, {{commander of the}} <b>British</b> Royal Navy in {{the eastern half of}} the Indian Ocean at Madras in <b>British</b> India in the eastern half of the Indian Ocean was now able to concentrate on a major threat to <b>British</b> shipping in the region; the Dutch squadron based in the Dutch East Indies, specifically on Java at the port of Batavia.|$|E
5|$|By August, Cornwallis had {{established}} the <b>British</b> at Yorktown, and Lafayette took up position on Malvern Hill, stationing artillery surrounding the <b>British,</b> who {{were close to}} the York River, and who had orders to construct fortifications to protect the <b>British</b> ships in Hampton Roads. Lafayette's containment trapped the <b>British</b> when the French fleet arrived and won the Battle of the Virginia Capes, depriving Cornwallis of naval protection. On 14 September 1781, Washington's forces joined Lafayette's. On 28 September, with the French fleet blockading the <b>British,</b> the combined forces laid siege to Yorktown. On 14 October, Lafayette's 400men on the American right took Redoubt9 after Alexander Hamilton's forces had charged Redoubt10 in hand-to-hand combat. These two redoubts were key to breaking the <b>British</b> defenses. After a failed <b>British</b> counter-attack, Cornwallis surrendered on 19 October 1781.|$|E
5|$|By October 9, {{all of the}} French and American {{guns were}} in place. Among the American guns there were three twenty-four pounders, three {{eighteen}} pounders, two eight-inch (203mm) howitzers and six mortars, totaling fourteen guns. At 3:00pm, the French guns opened the barrage and drove the <b>British</b> frigate, HMS Guadeloupe across the York River, where she was scuttled to prevent capture. At 5:00pm the Americans opened fire. Washington fired the first gun; {{legend has it that}} this shot smashed into a table where <b>British</b> officers were eating. The Franco-American guns began to tear apart the <b>British</b> defenses. Washington ordered that the guns fire all night so that the <b>British</b> could not make repairs. All of the <b>British</b> guns on the left were soon silenced. The <b>British</b> soldiers began to pitch their tents in their trenches and soldiers began to desert in large numbers. Some <b>British</b> ships were also damaged by cannonballs that flew across the town into the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Caroline Island {{remained}} uninhabited and undisturbed through World War II and afterwards. It remained under <b>British</b> jurisdiction, repossessed by the <b>British</b> Western Pacific High Commission in 1943 and governed {{as part of}} the Central and Southern Line Islands. In January 1972, the Central and Southern Line Islands, including Caroline, {{were joined}} with the <b>British</b> colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, which had become autonomous in 1971 as part of <b>British</b> decolonization efforts.|$|E
5|$|Castelli {{understood}} that the <b>British</b> force only aspired to annex {{the city to the}} <b>British</b> Empire, and resigned to avoid swearing allegiance to Britain. Santiago de Liniers liberated Buenos Aires a short time later, but Saturnino Rodríguez Peña helped Beresford escape, hoping to influence an eventual second invasion to implement reforms supported by Burke and Miranda. The second <b>British</b> invasion, however, ended the patriot's hopes of <b>British</b> support, and they fought against their former allies.|$|E
5|$|Colonel François-Charles de Bourlamaque, {{in command}} of Fort Carillon prior to Montcalm's arrival, knew by June 23 that a major <b>British</b> {{offensive}} was about to begin. He had sent a messenger bearing a letter from Vaudreuil to Abercrombie (part of a conventional exchange of pleasantries between opposing commanders) on June 10, expecting him to return; {{the fact that the}} <b>British</b> held him was an indication that the messenger had probably learned too much just by being in the <b>British</b> camp. Bourlamaque increased scouting activities, and learned from captured <b>British</b> scouts the approximate size of the <b>British</b> force.|$|E
5|$|Complete {{independence}} from <b>British</b> rule was granted on 10 December 1963, with the ZNP/ZPPP coalition as the governing body. The government requested a defence agreement from the United Kingdom, {{asking for a}} battalion of <b>British</b> troops to be stationed on the island for internal security duties, but this was rejected as it was deemed inappropriate for <b>British</b> troops {{to be involved in}} the maintenance of law and order so soon after independence. Much of the cabinet which was seeking closer ties with Egypt (ruled by the radical, anti-Western nationalist Nasser) did not want <b>British</b> troops in Zanzibar anyway. <b>British</b> intelligence reports predicted that a civil disturbance, accompanied by increasing communist activity, was likely in the near future and that the arrival of <b>British</b> troops might cause the situation to deteriorate further. However, many foreign nationals remained on the island, including 130 Britons who were direct employees of the Zanzibar government.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>British</b> training, the SLA was {{not large}} enough or {{strong enough to}} enter into combat with the RUF while also holding the ground it had recaptured, so the <b>British</b> persuaded UNAMSIL to move forward behind the {{advancing}} SLA to defend its recaptured ground. Additional <b>British</b> liaison officers were attached to UNAMSIL, and the <b>British</b> facilitated a daily coordination meeting for SLA and UNAMSIL commanders, while also assisting the UN forces in drawing up a campaign plan.|$|E
5|$|Dubourdieu's {{squadron}} {{was spotted}} approaching {{the island of}} Lissa at 03:00 on 12 March 1811 by Captain Gordon in HMS Active, which had led the <b>British</b> squadron from Port St George on a cruise off Ancona. Turning west, the <b>British</b> squadron awaited the French approach in line ahead, sailing along the north coast of the island within half a mile of the shoreline. By 06:00, Dubourdieu was approaching the <b>British</b> line from the north-east in two divisions, leading in Favorite {{at the head of}} the windward or western division. Dubourdieu hoped to pass ahead of Active {{at the head of the}} <b>British</b> line and cross it further east with Danaé, which led the leeward division. Dubourdieu intended to break the <b>British</b> line in two places and destroy the <b>British</b> squadron in the crossfire.|$|E
