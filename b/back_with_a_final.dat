5000|$|Smyslov had again won the Candidates' Tournament at Amsterdam in 1956, {{which led}} to another world {{championship}} match against Botvinnik in 1957. Assisted by trainers Vladimir Makogonov and Vladimir Simagin, Smyslov won by the score 12½ - 9½. The following year, Botvinnik exercised his right to a rematch, and won the title <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>final</b> score of 12½ - 10½. Smyslov later said his health suffered during the return match, as he came down with pneumonia, but he also acknowledged that Botvinnik had prepared very thoroughly. Over {{the course of the}} three World Championship matches, Smyslov had won 18 games to Botvinnik's 17 (with 34 draws), and yet he was only champion for a year. Yet Smyslov was to write in his autobiographical games collection Smyslov's Best Games, [...] "I have no reason to complain of my fate.

50|$|Flight, {{especially}} flight {{driven by}} the muscle-powered flapping of wings, is a strenuous physical activity. Although a sally from a perch {{may look like a}} single, rapid movement to the human eye, actually the bird must perform several moves: it begins its take-off by pushing with its feet to get into the air, it flaps its wings to generate forward motion (thrust), pursues the prey item, turns in the air, flies <b>back,</b> and, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>final</b> flurry of wings, lands on its perch. When a bird hawks insects, the prey must be substantial enough to pay off in terms of a biological energy budget. In other words, the bird must take in more energy in food than it is using up in the pursuit of food. Therefore, flycatchers tend to prefer insect prey of moderate size, such as flies, over smaller insects like gnats.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the world}} {{experiences}} a mutant baby boom, {{much of the}} mutant community seemingly begins experiencing [...] "secondary mutations", often taking the form of additional or enhanced abilities. In the aftermath of Vargas' attack, Beast's secondary mutation is [...] "jumpstarted" [...] due to the powers of teammate Sage. The further mutation causes Beast to develop a more feline physique, to which he initially has some trouble adapting. A psychic attack by the genocidal Cassandra Nova leaves Beast humiliated, badly beaten (by the controlled body of his friend Beak) and haunted by the possibility that his new form is simply a step in a continuous state of devolution. Additionally, the alteration in form causes his long-time girlfriend, Trish Tilby, to break up with him after being accused of bestiality in the media. Over time, Beast strikes up <b>a</b> strong friendship <b>with</b> Emma Frost, in one incident bringing her flowers to cheer her up. He finds her diamond form shattered into thousands of pieces and spends some time putting her <b>back</b> together. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>final</b> jolt of psionic energy from Jean Grey, Frost returns to life.|$|R
