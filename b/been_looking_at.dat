5|$|As {{a market}} town, Wellingborough has major high street chains mainly {{located in the}} town centre. The only {{shopping}} centre, Swansgate, previously known as the Arndale Centre, {{was built in the}} 1970s. Since 2009 the Borough Council has <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> rebuilding the centre and major stores want bigger floor-spaces. The Britannica Fund, which owns Swansgate shopping centre is currently in administration, and decision {{on the future of the}} centre is expected in early 2013. Supplementing the town centre shops are several out-of-town retail parks and supermarkets including a Sainsbury's, four Tesco stores, an Aldi store and a Morrisons store in the town centre. The town has a market three times a week and a weekly privately organised market.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, German anatomist Johann Heinrich Meckel {{recorded}} black-brown pigment granules in {{the blood}} and spleen of a patient {{who had died in}} a mental hospital. Meckel was thought to have <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> malaria parasites without realizing it; he did not mention malaria in his report. He hypothesized that the pigment was melanin. The causal relationship of pigment to the parasite was established in 1880, when French physician Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, working in the military hospital of Constantine, Algeria, observed pigmented parasites inside the red blood cells of malaria sufferers. He witnessed the events of exflagellation and became convinced that the moving flagella were parasitic microorganisms. He noted that quinine removed the parasites from the blood. Laveran called this microscopic organism Oscillaria malariae and proposed that malaria was caused by this protozoan. This discovery remained controversial until the development of the oil immersion lens in 1884 and of superior staining methods in 1890–1891.|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{was about}} fifteen when Churchill {{returned}} from the Continent in 1675, and {{he appears to have}} been almost immediately captivated by her charms and considerable good looks. Churchill's amorous, almost abject, missives of devotion were, it seems, received with suspicion – his first lover, Barbara Villiers, was just moving her household to Paris, feeding doubts that he may well have <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Sarah as a replacement mistress rather than a fiancée. However, his persistent courtship over the coming months eventually won over the beautiful, if relatively poor, Maid of Honour. Although Winston wished his son to marry the wealthy Catherine Sedley (if only to ease his own burden of debt), Colonel Churchill married Sarah sometime in the winter of 1677–78, possibly in the apartments of the Duchess of York.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} {{narcosis}} {{is related to}} the increased solubility of gases in body tissues, {{as a result of the}} elevated pressures at depth (Henry's law). Modern theories have suggested that inert gases dissolving in the lipid bilayer of cell membranes cause narcosis. More recently, researchers have <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> neurotransmitter receptor protein mechanisms as a possible cause of narcosis. The breathing gas mix entering the diver's lungs will have the same pressure as the surrounding water, known as the ambient pressure. After any change of depth, the pressure of gases in the blood passing through the brain catches up with ambient pressure within a minute or two, which results in a delayed narcotic effect after descending to a new depth. Rapid compression potentiates narcosis owing to carbon dioxide retention.|$|E

Soon after he combined telescope and prism to observe the spectrum of Venus, the Moon, Mars, and various stars such as Betelgeuse; his company continued to manufacture and sell high-quality refracting telescopes based on his original designs until its closure in 1884.|$|E

There's a lot going on, lots of string arrangements that we haven't had in the past." [...] Despite fearing that the band's new musical direction would split Opeth's fanbase, when asked if it will it be heavier or softer than Heritage, Åkerfeldt said, [...] "Maybe a little bit heavier, not death metal heavy, but hard rock/heavy metal heavy. There's also lots of progressive elements and acoustic guitars, but also more sinister-sounding riffs." [...] Åkerfeldt also produced the new album which will include string instrumentation, something that he became interested in doing when working on Storm Corrosion. The band members in Opeth felt rejuvenated after creating Heritage which resulted in closer relationships between them.|$|E

500|$|Townshend had <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> way of {{progressing}} {{beyond the}} standard three minute pop single format since 1966. Co-manager Kit Lambert shared Townshend's views and {{encouraged him to}} develop musical ideas, {{coming up with the}} term [...] "rock opera". The first use of the term was applied to a suite called [...] "Quads", set in a future where parents could choose the sex of their children. A couple want four girls but instead receive three girls and a boy, raising him as a girl anyway. The opera was abandoned after writing a single song, the hit single, [...] "I'm a Boy". When the Who's second album, A Quick One ran short of material during recording, Lambert suggested that Townshend should write a [...] "mini-opera" [...] to fill the gap. Townshend initially objected, but eventually agreed to do so, coming up with [...] "A Quick One, While He's Away", which joined short pieces of music together into a continuous narrative. During 1967, Townshend learned how to play the piano and began writing songs on it, taking his work more seriously. That year's The Who Sell Out included a mini-opera in the last track, [...] "Rael", which like [...] "A Quick One..." [...] was a suite of musical segments joined together.|$|E

Bennett also {{explained that he was}} accustomed to playing in acoustic music halls and outdoor theaters, so Gaga had <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> such options. [...] "I'm not interested in playing to 45,000 people a night, so [...] finding places where we could work for three or four days, or three or four weeks, in one place at a time.

On New Year's Eve 2014, the duo started the Cheek to Cheek Tour by performing at the Cosmopolitan Casino of Las Vegas, making it their first concert in US following the album's release. They also performed at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards and its scheduled a post-Grammy concert on February 8, 2015, at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, just after the conclusion of the ceremony. More shows were scheduled in 2015, including Hollywood Bowl on May 30; the Royal Albert Hall in London on June 8; and Radio City Music Hall in New York City on June 19. Jesse Lawrence from Forbes reported that there was high demand for the tickets, leading to additional dates being added to the itinerary. He also noted that the concerts had a much higher ticket price than the average, especially in the secondary markets.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} {{development}} process, Marvel, Derrickson, and Spaihts all envisioned Benedict Cumberbatch playing the title role. By {{the end of}} June, Marvel had reportedly <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Tom Hardy and Jared Leto for the film's lead as well, while Édgar Ramírez, who worked with Derrickson on 2014's Deliver Us from Evil, had discussed a possible role with the director. In July, after fans and the media had also championed Cumberbatch {{for the role of}} Doctor Strange, the actor explained at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con International that he would be unable to accept the role due to commitments to other projects. Feige stated that a lead actor would be announced [...] "relatively quickly", {{and by the end of}} that month Joaquin Phoenix entered talks to play the character. By September 2014, Marvel Studios was in negotiations to shoot Doctor Strange at Pinewood-Shepperton in the UK, with crews being assembled for a move into Shepperton Studios in late 2014/early 2015, for filming in May 2015. Negotiations with Phoenix ended in October 2014, as the actor felt that blockbuster films would never be [...] "fulfilling", with [...] "too many requirements that went against [...] instincts for character." [...] Marvel then placed Leto, Ethan Hawke, Oscar Isaac, Ewan McGregor, Matthew McConaughey, Jake Gyllenhaal, Colin Farrell, and Keanu Reeves on their shortlist for the character. Ryan Gosling also had discussions to play the character, while Reeves was not approached about the role, and Cumberbatch was still considered to be in contention. In October, Cumberbatch entered negotiations to play the character, and was officially cast in December. Feige explained that Marvel had kept returning to him for the role while considering other actors, with Derrickson noting that even during discussions with Phoenix, he and Marvel still wanted to cast Cumberbatch in the role. The company eventually decided to change the film's production schedule to fit around Cumberbatch's commitments, allowing him to join the project.|$|E
