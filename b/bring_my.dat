[...] "Santa Claus Is Back In Town" [...] and [...] "Santa <b>Bring</b> <b>My</b> Baby Back (to Me)" [...] were both commissioned expressly for the album.

500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{commented that}} this episode [...] "felt really flat", citing that the plots [...] "were fine, but {{they needed to}} be taken further" [...] and that they [...] "were almost there, but needed one more pass through the script." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning said that his favorite storyline in the episode was Jack and Frank's, and enjoyed Lupone's role, but noted that the episode [...] "lacked that familiar 30 Rock punch and tight rhythm", and gave the episode a 7.8 out 10 rating. Rick Porter of Zap2it said that [...] "Goodbye, My Friend" [...] had its [...] "usual share of brilliantly funny moments, but I'm not sure whether I can fully get behind an episode that hangs an entire subplot on the subtleties of Harry and the Hendersons." [...] He observed that Liz's [...] "baby fever" [...] came of out of nowhere, as the show had not referenced Liz's desire of becoming a mother for some time. Porter wrote that Jenna's fake injury was mostly a throwaway, [...] "but it did <b>bring</b> <b>my</b> favorite line of the night", in regards to Tracy explaining that he does not have a birth certificate and therefore has never had a birthday. [...] "I don't need it. I buy myself all the presents I need. And because of my drinking, I'm often surprised." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Jordan's Restaurant was {{the brainchild}} of Joe and Gene Silverberg, owners of the Bigsby & Kruthers {{clothing}} store. They obtained the rights to use Jordan's name in 1990 and spent $6 million developing the restaurant. Jordan himself never had ownership stakes in the restaurant, though he provided input in terms of the decor and the menu. He said he wanted it to be the [...] "kind of place where I can <b>bring</b> <b>my</b> family and friends to eat".|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the things}} being {{discussed}} at the meetings was the pressing issue of recruitment. A West Point graduate, Ulysses was {{the only man in}} town with professional military training, and was elected to preside over the meeting. When Ulysses was given command of the 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, a regiment composed of unruly volunteers, Jesse expressed disappointment in a letter to him, feeling that Ulysses' talent and efforts would have been better used commanding regular army troops. In a reply letter to his father Ulysses attempted to abate Jesse's criticism maintaining, [...] "You ask if I should not like to go in the regular army. I should not. I want to <b>bring</b> <b>my</b> children (recruits) up to useful employment, and in the army the chance is poor", stressing the point that he was more concerned about the war than he was a career.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2011 the Pointer Sisters toured Australia {{and played}} one gig in New Zealand with a lineup {{consisting}} of Ruth Pointer, Sadako Johnson and Issa Pointer; the last-named was a last-minute and presumably temporary replacement for Anita Pointer, {{who did not}} feel up to travel due to an unnamed health concern. Ruth Pointer, Sadako Johnson and Issa Pointer were also the personnel for a February 11, 2012 Pointer Sisters concert in Metairie, LA. At the July 6, 2012 Essence Fest show in New Orleans, Anita Pointer had rejoined the group, the lineup for that concert being Ruth and Anita Pointer and Sadako Johnson. In an August 2012 interview Ruth Pointer stated: [...] "Anita has had some health issues recently so we try {{to give her a}} break when she needs it. When that happens we <b>bring</b> <b>my</b> daughter [...] in to fill in for her." [...] At most recent Pointer Sisters concert, performing with the Columbus Symphony on June 14, 2013 (and filling in for Chaka Khan with a week's notice), the lineup was Anita, Ruth and Issa Pointer.|$|E
2500|$|When the Philadelphia {{convention}} adjourned in September 1787, its president, Washington, {{returned home}} and immediately sent {{a copy of}} the new Constitution to Henry, recommending he support it. Henry was in Richmond for the autumn legislative session as delegate for Prince Edward County. While thanking Washington for presiding in Philadelphia and for sending the document, he said of it, [...] "I have to lament that I cannot <b>bring</b> <b>my</b> Mind to accord with the proposed Constitution. The Concern I feel on this account is really greater than I am able to express." [...] He hinted, however, that he was still open [...] to changing his mind. This allowed Henry to remain noncommittal as opponents of the Constitution, such as Mason and Edmund Randolph (both delegates at Philadelphia) published their opinions, and to refine his views. In the initial Virginia battle over the Constitution, the call for a convention to decide whether the state should ratify it, Henry and Mason were among those who supported allowing the convention to ratify it conditional on amendments being made. The matter was compromised with language allowing the convention's members full rein in deciding what to do, and it was set for June 1788, with elections in March; both those who supported it {{and those who did not}} felt time would be to their advantage.|$|E

2500|$|After Elijah's {{confrontation}} with Ahab, God {{tells him to}} flee out of Israel, to a hiding place by the brook Chorath, east of the Jordan, where he will be fed by ravens. When the brook dries up, God sends him to a widow living {{in the town of}} Zarephath in Phoenicia. When Elijah finds her and asks to be fed, she says that she does not have sufficient food to keep her and her own son alive. Elijah tells her that God will not allow her supply of flour or oil to run out, saying, “Do not be afraid ... For thus says the Lord the God of Israel: The jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the Lord sends rain on the earth.” She feeds him the last of their food, and Elijah's promise miraculously comes true. God gave her [...] "manna" [...] from heaven even while he was withholding food from his unfaithful people in the promised land. Some time later the widow's son dies and the widow cries, [...] "You have come to me to <b>bring</b> <b>my</b> sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!" [...] Elijah prays that God might restore her son so that the trustworthiness of God's word might be demonstrated. 1 Kings 17:22 relates how God [...] "listened to the voice of Elijah; the life of the child came into him again, and he revived." [...] This is the first instance of raising the dead recorded in Scripture. This non-Israelite widow was granted the life of her son, the only hope for a widow in ancient society. The widow cried, [...] "...the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth." [...] She made a confession that the Israelites had failed to make.|$|E
