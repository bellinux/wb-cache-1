25|$|In Saturday morning's free {{practice}} session Andrea Montermini, who had replaced Ratzenberger in the Simtek, {{had a huge}} crash exiting the high-speed final corner. In light of recent events, the paddock <b>breathed</b> <b>a</b> <b>sigh</b> <b>of</b> <b>relief</b> {{when it was announced}} Montermini had escaped with only a broken ankle and chipped heel. Schumacher took pole ahead of Hill, HÃ¤kkinen, Lehto, Barrichello and Alesi. As Simtek and Sauber both fielded only 1 car for the race, both Pacific cars were able to qualify for the race by default as they did in Monaco.|$|E
500|$|Critics judged Leyland {{a better}} Test than county batsman. His {{first-class}} batting figures were not exceptional {{compared to other}} cricketers who played far fewer Test matches, but in Tests, his average is six runs an innings higher; against Australia, the strongest of England's opponents during his career, he averaged 56, a further increase of ten runs. Gibson suggests that he rose to the big occasions, and that he performed best against the toughest opponents. According to Leyland's obituary in The Times, [...] "He was essentially a man for the big occasion, a batsman at his best in a crisis, and his favourite game was a Roses match or an Australian Test. England's supporters often <b>breathed</b> <b>a</b> <b>sigh</b> <b>of</b> <b>relief</b> to see his burly figure purposefully striding to the wicket." [...] The writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow suggested that Leyland in a Test match was like the [...] "four-squarers of ancient or romantic times. He was Horatius on the tottering bridge; Hector, who alone stood between Troy and destruction. He was born to rescue. But he is more dangerous {{than those who are}} stubborn or grim. He has something of D'Artagnan in him; there is a gaiety besides the simplicity and strength; seen in the slight list of the cap, and in a certain jauntiness and optimism of gait." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the afternoon, crowds {{had filled}} the floor outside the blocked-off aisle, and the {{galleries}} as well, {{wanting to see}} the President, {{even if they could}} not greet him. [...] McKinley arrived just on time, glanced at the arrangements, and walked over to his place, where he stood with Milburn on his left and Cortelyou on his right. [...] The pipe organ began to play [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] as McKinley ordered the doors open to admit those who had waited to greet him. The police let them in, and McKinley prepared to perform his [...] "favorite part of the job." [...] An experienced politician, McKinley could shake hands with 50 people per minute, gripping their hands first so as to both guide them past him quickly and prevent his fingers from being squeezed. [...] Cortelyou anxiously watched the time; about halfway through the ten minutes allotted, he sent word to Babcock to have the doors closed when the presidential secretary raised his hand. Seeing Cortelyou looking at his watch, Babcock moved towards the doors. [...] As the reception continued, the organist played works by Johann Sebastian Bach. The procession of citizens shaking hands with their President was interrupted when 12-year-old Myrtle Ledger of Spring Brook, New York, who was accompanied by her mother, asked McKinley for the red carnation he always wore on his lapel. [...] The President gave it to her, then resumed work without his trademark good-luck piece. [...] The Secret Service men looked suspiciously on a tall, swarthy man who appeared restless as he walked towards the President, but <b>breathed</b> <b>a</b> <b>sigh</b> <b>of</b> <b>relief</b> when he shook hands with McKinley without incident and began to move towards the exit. [...] The usual rule that those who approached the President must do so with their hands open and empty was not being enforced, perhaps due to the heat of the day, as several people were using handkerchiefs to wipe their brows; the man who followed the swarthy individual had his right hand wrapped in one, as if injured. [...] Seeing this, McKinley reached for his left hand instead. [...] As the two men's hands touched at 4:07pm, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice in the abdomen with a [...]32 Iver Johnson revolver concealed under the handkerchief.|$|E

5000|$|Australia's Prime Minister John Howard {{reacted to}} the news happily. He said the Iraqi people could <b>breathe</b> <b>a</b> <b>sigh</b> <b>of</b> relief now that the former {{dictator}} was no longer at large. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation interviewed him.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{had emerged}} from a grove of trees and now saw a light {{streaming}} {{from the window of}} a cottage but a short distance away. The sight of this caused him to <b>breathe</b> <b>a</b> <b>sigh</b> <b>of</b> relief.|$|R

60|$|We walked again along Pall Mall. Passing the Carlton she {{suddenly}} clutched at my arm. A little stifled cry escaped her; the color left her cheeks. We increased our speed. Presently she <b>breathed</b> <b>a</b> <b>sigh</b> <b>of</b> <b>relief.</b>|$|E
