5000|$|Storage: The VRTX chassis {{includes}} {{shared storage}} slots that connect {{to a single}} or dual PERC 8 controller(s) via switched 6Gbit SAS. This controller which is managed through the CMC allows RAID groups to be configured and then allows for those RAID groups to be subdivided into individual virtual disks that can be presented out to either single or multiple blades. The shared storage slots are either 12 x 3.5" [...] HDD slots or 24 x 2.5" [...] HDD slots depending on the VRTX chassis purchased. Dell offers 12Gbit SAS disks for the VRTX, but these will operate at the slower 6Gbit rate for compatibility with the older PERC8 and SAS switches.Networking: The VRTX chassis has a built in IOM for supporting ethernet traffic to the server blades. At present the options for this IOM are an 8 port 1Gb pass-through module, a 24 Port 1Gb switch (R2401) and a 20 X 10Gb (+2*1Gb) switch (R2210). The 8 port pass through module offers 2 pass-through connections to each internal <b>blade</b> <b>slot</b> where the 24 port 1Gb switch option provides 16 internal ports (4 per <b>blade</b> <b>slot)</b> and 8 external ports {{to be used to}} uplink to the network. The R2210 has 16 internal, 4 external and two additional 1Gb external ports.The I/O modules used on the VRTX are a different size to the I/O modules of the M1000e, so I/O modules are not compatible between the systems.Management: A CMC is responsible for the management of the entire system. The CMC is similar to the CMC used in the M1000e chassis. Connection to the CMCs is done via separate RJ45 ethernet connectors.Power and cooling: The system comes with four PSUs at 110 or 230V AC. There is no option to use -48V DC PSUs. Each 1100 Watt PSU has a built-in fan. For cooling of the server-modules there are four blower-modules, each containing two fans, and for cooling {{of the rest of the}} chassis there are 6 internal fans which can only be reached by opening the chassis. The fans used are the same units as used in the PowerEdge R-720xd rack-server.KVM: Unlike the M1000e the VRTX doesn't have a separate KVM module, but it is built into the main chassis. The system only supports USB keyboard and mouse. Control of the KVM function is done via the mini LCD screen. These USB ports as well as the 15 pin VGA connector are at the front of the system.USB: The USB connectors are only for connecting keyboard and mouse; it doesn't support external storage via USB.LCD: Via the mini-LCD screen at the front of the system you can find status information of the system, configure some basic settings (such as CMC IP address) and manage the built-in KVM switch. The LCD screen functions can be controlled via a 5 button navigation system, similar to the system used on the M1000e.Serial: A single RS-232 serial communication port is provided at the back of the system. This connector is only used for local configuration to the CMC: it doesn't allow you to use this connector as serial port of a server in the system.Expansion slots: The system provides space for five PCIe Gen2 (2.0) expansion cards and 3 'full height' PCIe Gen2 (2.0) expansion cards. Via the management controller you can assign each slot to a specific server. You can only assign a PCIe slot to a server when the server is powered off as the PCIe card is recognized and initialized by the server BIOS at startup. Only certain PCIe cards are supported by Dell. Currently, VRTX support is limited to eight different PCIe cards, including six Ethernet NICs (Intel and Broadcom), a 6Git SAS adapter (LSI) and the AMD FirePro™ W7000.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} a program of {{experimental}} and analytical research in casing treatments over axial compressor rotor blade tips are presented. Circumferential groove, axial-skewed <b>slot</b> and <b>blade</b> angle <b>slot</b> treatments were tested at low speeds. With the circumferential groove treatment the stalling flow was reduced 5. 8 % at negligible efficiency sacrifice. The axial-skewed slot treatment improved the stalling flow by 15. 3 %; 1. 8 points in peak efficiency were sacrificed. The <b>blade</b> angle <b>slot</b> treatment improved the stalling flow by 15. 0 %; 1. 4 points in peak efficiency were sacrificed. The favorable stalling flow situations correlated well with observations of higher-than-normal surface pressures on the rotor blade pressure surfaces in the tip region, and with increased maximum diffusions on the suction surfaces. Annulus wall pressure gradients, especially in the 50 to 75 % chord region, are also increased and blade surface pressure loadings are shifted toward the trailing edge for treated configurations...|$|R

40|$|With {{the growing}} use of air transportation, {{aerospace}} industries are looking towards automated airplane inspection systems {{that can provide}} more rapid and economical services and achieve greater safety. Eddy current nondestructive testing technique {{is one of the}} most commonly used methods in aircraft inspection. One demanding application of the eddy current technique is the inspection of jet engine disks. In rotary fan disks in jet engines, cracks often occur in high stressed regions of <b>blade</b> <b>slots</b> such as chamfered edges. This presents problems in terms of flaw detection using the eddy current method since the crack signals are overwhelmed by the edge signals. Therefore, a fairly robust algorithm to extract flaw signals and eliminate contribution from other sources is needed. In this paper, a novel method based on morphological operations is proposed for crack detection in eddy current images of jet engine disks. The method is specially designed to eliminate contribution to the eddy current signals from the large scale geometry of the disk such as slot edges while preserving small scale signals such as indications due to cracks. Initial classification results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in extracting flaw features of different scales. The algorithm is also simple, fast, and robust in presence of noise...|$|R

30|$|The sound {{pressure}} level of differently designed circular saw blades were investigated during idling. Nine blade samples were used: three differently designed <b>blade</b> bodies (without <b>slots,</b> with four radial slots, and with four slots with copper cork), each with three diameters (260, 280, and 300 mm). The {{sound pressure}} level was measured at different rotational frequencies ranging from 25 to 65 rps in increments of 1 rps. Rubber damping rings 80 mm in diameter and 0.3 mm thick were placed between the saw blade and the collars, and the emitted noise was measured. Because of the whistling sound the <b>blades</b> without <b>slots</b> emitted high {{sound pressure level}}s. There were no significant changes when rubber damping rings were used. The use of rubber damping rings on the samples with radial slots eliminates the whistling noise. The saws with copper corks did not emit a whistling noise at all, and their aerodynamic noise was 2 – 3 dB (A) lower than the aerodynamic noise of the saws with radial slots. The relation between sound pressure emitted by the damped idling saw and peripheral velocity can be described by the power function with the exponent value between 4.8 and 5.2.|$|R

The numerical analyses are performed by Comsol Multiphysics® and the results obtained for a Savonius wind turbine with overlap only are compared to numerical and experimental benchmarks. Parametric analyses are performed, for fixed overlap ratio, by varying the slot angle β and the results show that for low angle β the Savonius rotor exploits improved performance at low tip speed ratio λ, evidencing a better starting torque. This circumstance is confirmed by the static analyses performed on the <b>slotted</b> <b>blades</b> in order to investigate the starting characteristic of the proposed Savonius wing generator configuration...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWhen the airfoil is working, the {{geometry}} of the channel that the fluid flows through changes with the airfoil profile. It makes the magnitude {{and direction of the}} velocity change, and resulting in flow separation. The impact produced by flow separation causes the loss of the flow's energy. This paper takes the blade of G 4 - 73 No. 8 D centrifugal fan as the research object. The flow and aerodynamic characteristics of the blades under different incidence angles are analyzed and researched by means of CFD. The slotted technique on centrifugal fan <b>blade</b> with <b>slots</b> cut along the blades pressure side to suction side is adopted. And <b>slotted</b> <b>blade</b> models data are compared with generic models. The results show that the method to create a <b>slot</b> in <b>blade</b> can control the stall of centrifugal fan flow passage availably. And under the appropriate parameters, slotted model can decrease the blade surface resistance and increase lift force effectively. Slotted model also has a role of control and mitigation of boundary layer separation, improving blade aerodynamic performance observably. The slot plays a similar role as the balancing hole, and make the high pressure low speed fluid flow into low-pressure side where the fluid is accelerated and has no extra energy be consumed. The research shows that slotted technique on centrifugal fan blade is useful to improve the characteristics of blade surface flow field, resulting in significant energy saving...|$|R

40|$|The {{technique}} and {{uses of the}} multiple blade slurry (MBS) saw are considered. Multiple bands of steel are arranged in a frame and the frame is reciprocated with the steel bands to a workpiece, while simultaneously applying abrasive {{at the point of}} contact. The <b>blades</b> wear <b>slots</b> in the workpiece and progress through the piece resulting in several parts of wafers. The transition to MBA from diamond slicing is justified by savings resulting from minimized kerf losses, minimized subsurface damage, and improved surface quality off the saw. This allows wafering much closer to finished thickness specifications. The current state of the art MBS technology must be significantly improved if the low cost solar array (LSA) goals are to be attained.

The PIV technique offers special advantages for the investigation of transonic flow fields, but also yields to special experimental difficulties, which are also describle in this article. Measured losses display a maximum at the downstream Mach number 1. This is strongly related to the behaviour of the base pressure.
