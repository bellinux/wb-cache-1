When compared to transistor logic gates of the time, the tunnel diode offered much higher speeds. Unlike other diode types, the tunnel diode offered the possibility of amplification of signals at each stage. The operating principles of a tunnel diode logic rely on biasing of the tunnel diode and supply of current from inputs over a threshold current, to switch the diode between two states. Consequently, tunnel diode {{logic circuits}} required a means to reset the diode after each logical operation. A simple tunnel diode gate offered little isolation between inputs and outputs and had low fan in and fan out.

30|$|Electron {{and neutral}} {{reactions}} are isotropic while ion reactions are highly directional and {{vary with the}} applied bias. By adjusting the <b>bias</b> <b>power,</b> the ions can be accelerated along the desired direction to aid the etching reaction. It is generally accepted that Br does not react spontaneously with Si and that energetic ions are needed for the reaction to occur. Ion-assisted Br and Cl atoms can react with Ge or Si atoms spontaneously under activation to form the volatile products GeBr 4, GeCl 4, SiBr 4, and SiCl 4, which are desorbed from the substrate surface and can be pumped away. This ion-assisted chemical reaction of Si with Br {{has been shown to}} be highly anisotropic. Higher vertical etch rates were obtained using HBr for <b>bias</b> <b>power</b> variations, which confirms that addition of HBr in Cl 2 can enhance the etch rate [17]. Since Cl- and Br-based plasma etch Ge and Si by an ion-assisted mechanism, the energy of ions such as Br+, Br 2 +, HBr+, Cl+, and Cl 2 + can be controlled by biasing the substrate holder. There is no pronounced change of lateral etch rate by varying the <b>bias</b> <b>power</b> for both etching at top surface and necking area. Undercuts were found in the fin structures etched using HBr mixtures, in the necking area, since lateral etching was enhanced by the defects along the Ge/Si interface. And also the mask potentially influences the shape evolution due to the sidewall striking from ion flux. This phenomenon is amplified as the profile becomes deeper and as the lateral ion velocity component increases. Because of the high angular dependence of the HBr-plasma etching process [18], thus, it can be concluded that the crystal structure is relatively weaker at the Ge/Si interface because of the partially bound atoms from the misfit dislocations and the relatively weak Ge-Ge and Ge-Si bonds. By adjusting the ratio of HBr/Cl 2 and <b>bias</b> <b>power,</b> different types of fin-like structures can be obtained during Ge device fabrication. The etching properties of Ge and Si are very similar. Gases that etch Si usually etch Ge at a greater rate. The strengths of Ge and Si bonds have been shown to be Ge-Ge[*]=[*] 263.6 [*]±[*] 7.1  kJ mol− 1 and Si-Si[*]=[*] 325 [*]±[*] 7  kJ mol− 1 [2]. Different bias powers were applied to adjust the vertical etch rate by directional acceleration of the ions. Images were recorded after the gate stack process. The vertical etch rate was calculated from the film height relative to the oxide substrate. Lateral etch rates were determined from two parts of the fin: the lateral etching at the top surface of the fin, and the etching in the necking area close to the Ge/Si interface. In summary, the <b>bias</b> <b>power</b> was experimentally found to be the most critical parameter in the etching process and therefore, in affecting the device characteristics accordingly.|$|E

40|$|Optical {{wireless}} communication (OWC) is a promising alternative to radio frequency (RF) communication with a significantly larger and unregulated spectrum. Impairments {{in the physical}} layer, such as the non-linear transfer characteristic of the transmitter, the dispersive optical wireless channel and the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at the receiver, reduce {{the capacity of the}} OWC system. Single-carrier multi-level pulse position modulation (M-PPM) and multilevel pulse amplitude modulation (M-PAM) suffer from inter-symbol interference (ISI) in the dispersive channel which reduces their capacity even after channel equalization. Multi-carrier modulation such as optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (O-OFDM) with multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) is known to maximize the channel capacity through bit and power loading. There are two general signal structures: bipolar Gaussian signal with a direct current (DC) bias, i. e. DC-biased O-OFDM (DCO-OFDM), or unipolar half- Gaussian signal, employing only the odd subcarriers, i. e. asymmetrically clipped O-OFDM (ACO-OFDM). In this thesis, the signal distortion from the transmitter nonlinearity is minimized through pre-distortion, optimum signal scaling and DC-biasing. The optical front-ends impose minimum, average and maximum optical power constraints, as well as an average electrical power constraint, on the information-carrying signals. In this thesis, the optical signals are conditioned within these constraints through optimum signal scaling and DC-biasing. The presented analysis of the optical-to-electrical (O/E) conversion enables the derivation of the electrical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver, including or excluding the additional DC <b>bias</b> <b>power,</b> which is translated into bit-error rate (BER) performance. In addition, a generalized piecewise polynomial model for the non-linear transfer characteristic of the transmitter is proposed. The non-linear distortion in O-OFDM is translated by means of the Bussgang theorem and the central limit theorem (CLT) into attenuation of the data-carrying subcarriers at the receiver plus zero-mean complex-valued Gaussian noise. The attenuation factor and the variance of the non-linear distortion noise are derived in closed form, and they are accounted towards the received electrical SNR. Through pre-distortion with the inverse of the proposed piecewise polynomial function, the linear dynamic range of the transmitter is maximized, reducing the non-linear distortion to double-sided signal clipping. Finally, the OWC schemes are compared in terms of spectral efficiency and electrical SNR requirement as the signal bandwidth exceeds the coherence bandwidth of the optical wireless channel for a practical 10 dB linear dynamic range. Through optimum signal scaling and DCbiasing, DCO-OFDM is found to achieve the highest spectral efficiency for a target SNR, neglecting the additional DC <b>bias</b> <b>power.</b> When the DC <b>bias</b> <b>power</b> is counted towards the signal power, DCO-OFDM outperforms PAM with linear equalization, approaching the performance of the more computationally intensive PAM with non-linear equalization. In addition, the average optical power in O-OFDM is varied over dynamic ranges of 10 dB, 20 dB and 30 dB. When the additional DC <b>bias</b> <b>power</b> is neglected, DCO-OFDM is shown to achieve the Shannon capacity, while ACO-OFDM exhibits a 3 dB gap which grows with higher SNR targets. When the DC <b>bias</b> <b>power</b> is included, DCO-OFDM outperforms ACO-OFDM for the majority of average optical power levels with the increase of the SNR target or the dynamic range...|$|E
