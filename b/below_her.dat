5|$|Long ago, King Childeric I came to {{the forest}} to build a city while the Queen experimented with black magic to gain eternal life. A plague swept through the land, and she hid in her tower, while her husband and {{everyone}} <b>below</b> <b>her</b> perished. Her spell granted her immortal life, but not the youth and beauty {{to go along with}} it. Her youthful appearance now only exists in her mirror, the source of her life, as an illusion and nothing more.|$|E
5|$|The empress, {{the legal}} {{wife of the}} emperor, also had {{an area of the}} palace {{separate}} from that of the emperor's private apartments, where the empress was expected to spend every fifth night with the emperor. Both the empress and the heir apparent received an income from the taxes of forty counties. She also had a Supervisor of the Household (ranked 2,000-dan), and many other subordinates, either male eunuchs or female maids, who took care of domestic needs. The concubines of the harem were subordinates of the empress and were ranked <b>below</b> <b>her</b> in fourteen grades by the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han (r. 49–33). However, the founder of Eastern Han abolished the fourteen salary-ranks in favor of three ranks with no definite salary; instead, the concubines were irregularly granted gifts. The chief concubine of Western Han, the Brilliant Companion, shared the same salary-rank as the Chancellor, while the concubine ranked just <b>below</b> <b>her,</b> the Favorite Beauty, shared the same salary-rank as any one of the Nine Ministers.|$|E

5|$|The font design {{featured}} on the front cover was created by Pizz, a graphic artist from Long Beach, who also designed album cover art for several other indie rock bands. The {{back side of the}} album features a painting by bassist Emery, depicting a topless woman looking at herself through a hand mirror. On her chest is a red heart surrounded by arrows, and <b>below,</b> <b>her</b> ribs protrude from her sides, possibly a reference to anorexia and body image issues, a major theme of the album and its successor Live Through This.|$|E

5|$|The Dhyana Mantra of Raja-matangi {{from the}} Purashcharyarnava {{describes}} Matangi as green in colour with the crescent moon upon her forehead. She has long hair, a smiling expression and intoxicated eyes, and wears a garland of kadamba flowers and various ornaments. She perspires a little around the face, which renders {{her even more}} beautiful. <b>Below</b> <b>her</b> navel are three horizontal folds of skin and a thin vertical line of fine hair. Seated on an altar and flanked by two parrots, she represents the 64 arts. The Saradatilaka, adds to this description that Raja-Matangi plays the veena, wears conch-shell earrings and flower garlands, and has flower paintings adorning her forehead.|$|E

5|$|The carvings at {{the east}} {{entrance}} are battered and blurry. One in {{the southeast corner of}} the mandapa (see 2 on plan) depicts Shiva and Parvati in Mount Kailash in the Himalayas, and the shows the Umamaheshvara story. The scene includes rocky terrain and clouds layered horizontally. On top of a rock sit the four-armed Shiva and Parvati by his side. Nandi stands <b>below</b> <b>her,</b> while celestial apsaras float on the clouds above. There are traces of a crown and a disc behind Shiva, but it is all damaged. The scene is crowded with accessory figures, which may be because the eastern entrance was meant to have a devotional focus.|$|E
5|$|The song's video {{features}} close-up {{shots of}} Beyoncé and incorporates psychedelic light effects and symmetrical filming photography. As the acoustic guitar begins playing, Beyoncé's face comes into view. She stands with {{her blond hair}} draped just <b>below</b> <b>her</b> exposed shoulders. As she intently stares into the camera, her skin glistens as though it has been coated with a honey-like and glittery substance. Turning her head from right to left, with her eyes fixed off-camera, Beyoncé starts belting out the first verse. As the chorus is reached, scenes of Beyoncé in a darkened room are shown. Additionally, she places her face delicately against dripping water, gently brushing it with her lips and palms. The scenery changes and Beyoncé {{is back in the}} darkened chamber, where she removes her dress.|$|E
5|$|The woman {{wears an}} elegant low-cut black dress with dark bands of fur {{at the neck}} and wrist. Her clothes are of the then-fashionable Burgundian style, which emphasises the tall and thin {{aesthetic}} of the Gothic ideal. Her dress is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in <b>below</b> <b>her</b> breasts. The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention {{to the structure of}} the clothing—the careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its position—is typical for the artist.|$|E

5|$|When Stone lectured in {{the dress}} {{in the fall}} of 1851, hers was the first Bloomer most of her audiences had ever seen. But by then, the dress had become controversial. Although {{newspapers}} had initially praised the practicality of the new style, they soon turned to ridicule and condemnation, now viewing the trousers as a usurpation of the symbol of male authority. Many women retreated in the face of criticism, but Stone continued to wear the short dress exclusively for the next three years. She also wore her hair short, cut just <b>below</b> <b>her</b> jaw line. After Stone lectured in New York City in April, 1853, the report of her speeches in the Illustrated News was accompanied by this engraving of Stone in the Bloomer dress.|$|E
5|$|Wu {{returned}} to Beijing {{after three years}} of hard labour, but six years later, China fell into the even greater turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966. Xin Fengxia and Wu Zuguang were both denounced {{at the beginning of the}} period. She became disabled <b>below</b> <b>her</b> left knee after a severe beating. Their friend Lao She drowned himself after being similarly tortured. During the tumultuous decade Wu and Xin both served years of forced labour. In December 1975, she became paralyzed after suffering a stroke, and Wu took care of her for the rest of her life.|$|E
5|$|On 3October Speedy, while sailing {{once again}} off Gibraltar, spotted ten small ships {{coming out of}} Algeciras, gunboats {{apparently}} attempting to attack a British convoy that was then passing. Brenton identified the ships as merchantmen, attempting to evade the British at Gibraltar in the bad weather. On Speedys approach, they scattered, four sheltering under a fort. Speedy approached and fired on them, causing their crews to abandon their ships. They were driven ashore by the wind, and despite sending boats out, {{it was impossible to}} get them off, so they were left to be reduced to wrecks. Three days later, Speedy was standing off Europa Point when twelve gunboats were sighted coming out of Algeciras to attack two merchant ships making their way past Gibraltar. One, the Unity, was carrying wine and spirits for the fleet. Their combined firepower far outweighed that of Speedy, but Brenton turned his ship towards them, covering the escape of one of the merchantmen with his fire. The gunboats were attempting to catch the Unity when Brenton took his ship through the flotilla, close enough to break many of their oars, maintaining a constant fire from his guns and with every spare member of the crew firing muskets. The Spanish flotilla broke and fled. Speedy suffered two men killed and one wounded, and sustained considerable damage to her rigging and <b>below</b> <b>her</b> waterline. She was unable to return to Gibraltar in the rising wind, and was forced to run along the coast to Tétouan Bay, where her shot-holes were plugged to allow her to make her way back. During the engagement with the gunboats, the guns in the fortress of Gibraltar had not fired in support of Speedy. When Brenton asked why, the Governor of Gibraltar, General Charles O'Hara, replied that he had arranged with the Governor of Algeciras for the guns never to be fired at the gunboats so as not to annoy the inhabitants of the town.|$|E

25|$|Ælfgifu predeceased {{her husband}} in 944. In the early 12th century, William of Malmesbury wrote that she {{suffered}} from an illness {{during the last few}} years of her life, but there may have been some confusion with details of Æthelgifu's life as recorded in a forged foundation charter of the late 11th or 12th century (see <b>below).</b> <b>Her</b> body was buried and enshrined at the nunnery.|$|E

Ennis recorded personal best times in the 200metres (23.11seconds) and the 800metres (2minutes 8.46seconds). It was a result that meant Ennis had extended her unbeaten record in multi-events competition to two years.|$|E
