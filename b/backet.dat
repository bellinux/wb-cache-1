Flow over the Savonius rotor separates when the rotor <b>backet</b> 2 ̆ 7 s incident angle becomes large, influencing on the performance figure. Feasibility study of the delta-vortex generator applied on the Savonius rotor showed promising results in improving power coefficient figure. This paper reports the optimum arrangement of the slit, which is acting as both suction and blowing device, applied on the Savonius rotor through systematically varying installed locations. Based on the experimental studies, the following general conclusions can be made:(1) Boundary layer control using slit is very effective in preventing or delaying separation from the rotor particularly at lower speed range. (2) Optimum angle of the slit location with suction was 40 ゜from <b>backet</b> edge...|$|E

In the course of the ALTQ development, we have faced a number of limitations and complexities imposed by hardware and software. These practical issues are often overlooked by research people. This paper examines gaps between the theoretical QoS models and the real system. One is in the queue operation model and the other is in the output buffer model. A new set of queue operations are defined in ALTQ as a tradeoff between clean abstraction and compatibility with the existing drivers. A token <b>backet</b> regulator is added to the output queue model in order to control the number of packets buffered in network cards. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Sports Engineering [© 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd]. The definitive published version can be found at: [URL] high-speed first serve has become an increasingly dominant factor in tennis, raising concerns over the influence modern racket technology has on the game. One concern is that rackets are now too powerful and so overemphasise a player’s ability to produce fast serves. This may help explain the ‘penalty shootout’ scenario, where match result id dictated by the relative speed and consistency of the players’ first serves. There is some concern that on the faster surfaces, maximum service speeds have reached, or are approaching, the service returnee’s reaction threshold, making it virtually impossible for players to return the ball. To {{shed light on the}} issue the factors relating to <b>‘racket</b> power’, the amount a racket magnifies a player’s innate ability to impart linear velocity to a tennis ball, need to be considered. Various studies have been performed that shed some light on the subject. This paper presents an overview of the published literature related to <b>‘racket</b> power’ in the game of tennis, a review of previous research on specific and sometimes controversial issues. Areas meriting further investigation are identified to encourage future research into racket power...|$|R

40|$|A self-recording water-stage or {{rainfall}} gauge exposed {{under the}} severe meteorologicalconditions {{for several years}} has sometimes troubles in the accuracy of time. These troubles are aptto cause fundamental faults in hydrological researches especially in a small or urbanized watershed. In order to mitigate the influence of such troubles, we have developed a device to recordrainfall data simultaneously on self-recording charts of a water gauge without the fundamentalremodeling of the water gauge. Four types of the device are introduced in this paper. Types A and B are both mono-response style to the signal from a tipping <b>backet</b> rain gauge,but the former records the signal in {{one side and the}} latter in both sides to the base line. Types Cand D are both response-cumulating style, but the former is used for a water gauge with the one-scale type of recording chart and the latter for two-scale type. Types A and B have difficulty inreading data of high-intensity rainfall, because they are designed as a time-marker. On the otherhand, types C and D are useful for high-intensity rainfall...|$|E
50|$|Organized {{crime in}} major cities, {{most of which}} were Democratic Party strongholds, was a {{favorite}} attack theme of Republican politicians and the media. Petty crime rates went up after 1945, now that far more young men were back on the streets, and much more money was in circulation. Far more serious was organized crime run by professional criminal gangs. The Justice Department in 1947 organized a <b>'racket</b> squad' to build evidence for grand jury investigations in several major cities. The income tax returns of gambling entrepreneurs and racketeers were audited. However, federal officials were reluctant to share their new information with local law enforcement. Truman and his Attorney General J. Howard McGrath in February 1950, told local officials that they had to bear the chief burden in defeating organized crime. Senator Estes Kefauver, a liberal Democrat from Tennessee, launched a major Senate investigation in 1950 as chairman of the Special Committee to Investigate Organized Crime in Interstate Commerce. Kefauver, although only a freshman in the Senate, received large-scale national coverage and became a presidential contender. He defeated Truman in the first primary, that of New Hampshire in March 1952; Truman surprised everyone by dropping out of the presidential race. Kefauver remained visible and was the vice presidential nominee in 1956.|$|R
40|$|A formal {{segregation}} {{analysis for the}} disease 'chronic childhood spinal muscular atrophy' is presented. This disease {{is also known as}} 'Kugelberg-Welander disease', 'arrested Werdnig-Hoffmann disease', and 'chronic proximal or generalised spinal muscular atrophy'. There were 124 index cases occurring in 115 families. Ascertainment of index patients was by incomplete multiple selection. Three types of {{segregation analysis}} were performed: Weinberg Proband, an improved Weinberg Proband with a variance corrected formula for differences both in family size and ascertainment probability and a <b>backeting</b> technique assuming the extremes of both single and of truncate selection. All three methods gave similar results. The improved Weinberg Proband method with corrections for differences in ascertainment and in family size gave a segregation ratio of 0. 18 and a 95 % confidence range of 0. 11 to 0. 25. The mid-point of the bracketing method assuming extremes of truncate and of single selection was 0. 19. The segregation ratio of that group of children with clinical onset before 9 months of age was 0. 21, which does not differ significantly from the 0. 25 predicted on the basis of autosomal recessivity. Evidence is presented to indicate that 25 % of index patients may be due to new dominant mutations, or phenocopies, or both, and that these occur particularly among sporadic cases with clinical onset over 2 years of age. Empirical risk figures for use in genetic counselling are presented, and the literature of the subject is reviewed...|$|R

The scope of the SYR of the Fourth Assessment Report includes material contained in the three Working Group contributions to the AR 4, and it draws on information contained in other IPCC Reports as required. The SYR is based exclusively on assessments by the IPCC Working Groups, it does not refer to or assess the primary scientific literature itself. The SYR is largely self-contained but provides only a very condensed summary of the much richer information contained in the underlying Working Group reports. Users may wish to access relevant material at the required level of detail in the following manner: The Summary for Policymakers (SPM) of the SYR provides the most condensed summary of our current understanding of scientific, technical and socio-economic aspects of climate change. All references in curly brackets in this Summary for Policymakers refer to numbered sections of this SYR. The Introduction and six Topics of this SYR provide more detailed and more comprehensive information than the SYR SPM.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the pupils' and teacher's perceptions and learning experiences from a season of Sport Education that was conducted for the first time at the research school. Two groups of Year 10 (age 14 / 15) pupils participated in a nine week season (16 & 17 sessions per group) of badminton. Data collection included questionnaire, lesson observation, group and individual interviews before, during and after the season. Nine-month follow-up group interviews were carried out to assess the sustainability of outcomes from Sport Education. All qualitative data were transcribed and analysed using the constant comparison of emerging themes. Quantitative data provided a psychological motivational profile and physical activity levels of pupils before and after the intervention for both a Sport Education group and a non-Sport Education (normative) group. The motivational profile was measured using a validated questionnaire used in the Nike/YST multi-site study (Kirk, Fitzgerald, Wang & Biddle, 2000). Physical activity was measured using a modified form of the Self-Administered Physical Activity Checklist (Sallis, 1996). The results indicated that Sport Education was viewed a success by the pupils and teacher at this school. The pupils preferred this teaching model to their previous PE experiences. The teacher felt the model held much potential to achieve their department aims and continued to use Sport Education with his classes following this first time experience. The emerging themes from the study were the competitions, changing power hierarchies, team affiliation and persistent team membership, changes to the motivational climate, and changes to traditional PE. These themes described the positive perceptions from both pupils and the teacher while also revealing issues that caused difficulties or that would require further attention before any subsequent delivery of Sport Education. Quantitative findings showed no significant (p> 0. 05) difference between all motivation variables. Physical activity levels increased pre- to post-Sport Education for boys and girls in the activity <b>'racket</b> sports' where both the number of pupils participating and the number of hours per week increased (P< 0. 01) following the season of Sport Education, where no change was shown for the normative group. Recommendations are given for future research in Sport Education.
