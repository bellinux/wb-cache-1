2500|$|Non-specific <b>binding</b> of <b>primers</b> {{frequently}} occurs and {{may occur}} for several reasons. These include repeat sequences in the DNA template, non-specific <b>binding</b> between <b>primer</b> and template, {{high or low}} G-C content in the template, or incomplete <b>primer</b> <b>binding,</b> leaving the 5' end of the primer unattached to the template. Non-specific <b>binding</b> of degenerate <b>primers</b> is also common. Manipulation of annealing temperature and magnesium ion concentration {{may be used to}} increase specificity. For example, lower concentrations of magnesium or other cations may prevent non-specific primer interactions, thus enabling successful PCR. A [...] "hot-start" [...] polymerase enzyme whose activity is blocked unless it is heated to high temperature (e.g., 90–98˚C) during the denaturation step of the first cycle, is commonly used to prevent non-specific priming during reaction preparation at lower temperatures. Chemically mediated hot-start PCRs require higher temperatures and longer incubation times for polymerase activation, compared with antibody or aptamer-based hot-start PCRs.|$|R

By analysis of the native structure of the Ty 1 <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> site and {{by a series of}} manipulations of this region and assessment of the effects on retrotransposition, we show that <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> site inheritance is not from the tRNA primer, which is inconsistent with classical retroviral models. This unusual inheritance pattern holds even when the Ty 1 <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> site is lengthened in order to be more retrovirus-like. Finally, the distantly related Ty 3 element has an inheritance pattern like Ty 1, indicating evolutionary conservation of the alternative pathway used by Ty 1.

40|$|High {{affinity}} target-binding aptamers {{are identified}} from random oligonucleotide libraries by an in vitro selection process called Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX). Since the SELEX process includes a PCR amplification step the randomized {{region of the}} oligonucleotide libraries need to be flanked by two fixed <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> sequences. These <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> sites are often difficult to truncate because they {{may be necessary to}} maintain the structure of the aptamer or may even be part of the target binding motif. We designed a novel type of RNA library that carries fixed sequences which constrain the oligonucleotides into a partly double-stranded structure, thereby minimizing the risk that the <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> sequences become part of the target-binding motif. Moreover, the specific design of the library including the use of tandem RNA Polymerase promoters allows the selection of oligonucleotides without any <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> sequences.

RESULTS: Eighteen different primer pairs were analyzed in silico regarding specificity (using BLAST analysis) and the presence of secondary structures at <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> sites (using mFOLD). The most specific and efficiently <b>binding</b> <b>primer</b> pairs, according to these analyses, were selected for qPCR-analysis to determine amplification efficiency, limit of quantification and intra-run reproducibility.

40|$|Human {{telomerase}} is a ribonucleoprotein {{which uses}} its internal RNA moiety as {{a template for}} telomeric DNA synthesis. This enzyme is up-regulated in most malignant tumors and is therefore considered as a possible cancer target. Here we {{examined the effects of}} differently modified oligomers on telomerase activity from HL- 60 cell extracts (TRAP-eze assay). Phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides (PS-ODNs) inhibited telomerase activity at subnanomolar concen-trations and proved to be more efficient than peptide nucleic acids. In contrast to all the investigated oligomers, PS-ODNs were found to bind to the protein motif of telomerase called the <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> site but poorly to its RNA. This is suggested by kinetic investigations demonstrating a competitive interaction of PS-ODNs and TS primer at the <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> site. The Km value of the TS primer was 10. 8 nM, the Ki value of a 20 mer PS-ODN was 1. 6 nM. When the TS primer was PS-modified a striking increase in the telomerase activity was found which correlates with the number of phosphodiesters replaced. The Km value of a completely PS-modified TS primer was 0. 56 nM. Based on these results the design of chimeric ODNs is proposed consisting of a 5 ′-PS-modified part targeting the <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> site and a 3 ′-terminus part targeting the telomerase RNA...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The reverse {{transcriptase}} (RT) enzyme of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) {{plays a crucial role}} in the life cycle of the virus by converting the single stranded RNA genome into double stranded DNA that integrates into the host chromosome. In addition, RT is also responsible for the generation of mutations throughout the viral genome, including in its own sequences and is thus responsible for the generation of quasi-species in HIV- 1 -infected individuals. We therefore characterized the molecular properties of RT, including the conservation of functional motifs, degree of genetic diversity, and evolutionary dynamics from five mother-infant pairs following vertical transmission. Results The RT open reading frame was maintained with a frequency of 87. 2 % in five mother-infant pairs' sequences following vertical transmission. There was a low degree of viral heterogeneity and estimates of genetic diversity in mother-infant pairs' sequences. Both mothers and infants RT sequences were under positive selection pressure, as determined by the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions. Phylogenetic analysis of 132 mother-infant RT sequences revealed distinct clusters for each mother-infant pair, suggesting that the epidemiologically linked mother-infant pairs were evolutionarily closer to each other as compared with epidemiologically unlinked mother-infant pairs. The functional domains of RT which are responsible for reverse transcription, DNA polymerization and RNase H activity were mostly conserved in the RT sequences analyzed in this study. Specifically, the active sites and domains required for <b>primer</b> <b>binding,</b> template <b>binding,</b> <b>primer</b> and template positioning and nucleotide recruitment were conserved in all mother-infant pairs' sequences. Conclusion The maintenance of an intact RT open reading frame, conservation of functional domains for RT activity, preservation of several amino acid motifs in epidemiologically linked mother-infant pairs, and a low degree of genetic variability following vertical transmission is consistent with an indispensable role of RT in HIV- 1 replication in infected mother-infant pairs. </p...|$|R

30|$|The {{recently}} described {{detection of}} micro RNA (=miRNA, miR) introduced yet another complexity {{to the value}} of qRT-PCR namely post-transcriptional modification of translation in which mRNA level is stable with attenuation of protein synthesis.

Additionally, the qRT-PCR method itself is fraught with issues such as loading of reagents, variability between technicians, normalization between samples and choice of housekeeping genes.

40|$|The current {{model for}} in¯uenza virus mRNA tran-scription {{involves}} the sequential {{interaction of the}} viral polymerase with the 5 ¢- and 3 ¢-ends of vRNA, with each RNA±protein interaction triggering a polymerase function necessary for cap-primed transcription. Here we show that {{the order in which}} this ternary complex is assembled is in fact important. Polymerase bound simultaneously to a pre-annealed duplex of the 5 ¢- and 3 ¢-ends of vRNA had greatly increased levels of <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> and endonuclease activities compared to a sequentially assembled complex. Increased <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> was due to the activation of a high af®nity binding site with a preference for primer length RNAs. This cor-related with enhanced levels of cap-primed tran-scription. Polymerase that was bound initially to just 5 ¢ vRNA had low <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> activity, but was endonucleolytically active. Neither activity was signi®cantly increased by the subsequent addition of 3 ¢ vRNA, and this sequentially assembled com-plex had correspondingly low mRNA transcription activity. Nevertheless, both routes of assembly led to complexes that were highly competent for di-nucleotide ApG-primed transcription. Therefore, polymerase complexes assembled on pre-annealed 5 ¢ and 3 ¢ terminal viral RNA sequences have distinct properties from those assembled by sequential loading of polymerase onto the 5 ¢-end followed by the 3 ¢-end. This suggests a mechanism by which the virus couples transcription initiation and termination during mRNA transcription...|$|R

Within the group of Moloney leukemia virus-related viruses, only the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus showed high enhancer activity in myeloid (including ery-throid) cells.
