5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh <b>beetroot</b> <b>juice,</b> while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture.

40|$|Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) {{results in}} a failure to adequately supply blood and oxygen (O 2) to working tissues and presents as claudication pain during walking. Nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is essential for vascular health and function. Plasma nitrite (NO 2 −) is a marker of vascular NO production but {{may also be a}} protected circulating “source” that can be converted to NO during hypoxic conditions, possibly aiding perfusion. We hypothesized that dietary supplementation of inorganic nitrate in the form of <b>beetroot</b> (BR) <b>juice</b> would increase plasma NO 2 − concentration, increase exercise tolerance, and decrease gastrocnemius fractional O 2 extraction, compared with placebo (PL). This was a randomized, open-label, crossover study. At each visit, subjects (n = 8) underwent resting blood draws, followed by consumption of 500 ml BR or PL and subsequent blood draws prior to, during, and following a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) test. Gastrocnemius oxygenation during the CPX was measured by near-infrared spectroscopy. There were no changes from rest for [NO 2 −] (152 ± 72 nM) following PL. BR increased plasma [NO 2 −] after 3 h (943 ± 826 nM; P ≤ 0. 01). Subjects walked 18 % longer before the onset of claudication pain (183 ± 84 s vs. 215 ± 99 s; P ≤ 0. 01) and had a 17 % longer peak walking time (467 ± 223 s vs. 533 ± 233 s; P ≤ 0. 05) following BR vs. PL. Gastrocnemius tissue fractional O 2 extraction was lower during exercise following BR (7. 3 ± 6. 2 vs. 10. 4 ± 6. 1 arbitrary units; P ≤ 0. 01). Diastolic blood pressure was lower in the BR group at rest and during CPX testing (P ≤ 0. 05).

Therefore, we investigated the effect of dietary nitrate supplementation on arterial, muscle, and cerebral oxygenation status, symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS), and exercise tolerance at simulated 5, 000 m altitude. Fifteen young, healthy volunteers participated in three experimental sessions according to a crossover study design. From 6 days prior to each session, subjects received either <b>beetroot</b> (BR) <b>juice</b> delivering 0. 07 mmol nitrate/kg body wt/day or a control drink (CON). One session was in normoxia with CON (NOR(CON)); the two other sessions were in hypoxia (11 % O(2)), with either CON (HYP(CON)) or BR (HYP(BR)). Subjects first cycled for 20 min at 45 % of peak O(2) consumption (VO(2) peak; EX(45 %)) and thereafter, performed a maximal incremental exercise test (EX(max)). Whole-body VO(2), arterial O(2) saturation (%SpO(2)) via pulsoximetry, and tissue oxygenation index of both muscle (TOI(M)) and cerebral (TOI(C)) tissue by near-infrared spectroscopy were measured. Hypoxia per se substantially reduced VO(2) peak, %SpO(2), TOI(M), and TOI(C) (NOR(CON) vs. HYP(CON), P < 0. 05). Compared with HYP(CON), VO(2) at rest and during EX(45 %) was lower in HYP(BR) (P < 0. 05), whereas %SpO(2) was higher (P < 0. 05). TOI(M) was ∼ 4 - 5 % higher in HYP(BR) than in HYP(CON) both at rest and during EX(45 %) and EX(max) (P < 0. 05). TOI(C) {{as well as the}} incidence of AMS symptoms were similar between HYP(CON) and HYP(BR) at any time. Hypoxia reduced time to exhaustion in EX(max) by 36 % (P < 0. 05), but this ergolytic effect was partly negated by BR (+ 5 %, P < 0. 05). Short-term dietary nitrate supplementation improves arterial and muscle oxygenation status but not cerebral oxygenation status during exercise in severe hypoxia.

The studied pulps were formulated by a mix of pear and pineapple (P_Amarela) and of pear, strawberry, <b>beetroot</b> and lemon <b>juice</b> (P_Vermelha). The thermal binomials were optimized taking into account the achieved peroxidase activity inhibition (≥ 80 %) and microbial load reduction (≥ 1 Log cycle) just after processing.

50|$|The {{simplest}} {{method to}} preserve an egg {{is to treat}} it with salt. Salt draws water out of bacteria and molds, which prevents their growth. The Chinese salted duck egg is made by immersing duck eggs in brine, or coating them individually with a paste of salt and mud or clay. The eggs stop absorbing salt after about a month, having reached osmotic equilibrium. Their yolks take on an orange-red color and solidify, but the white remains somewhat liquid. They are often boiled before consumption, and are often served with rice congee.Another method is to make pickled eggs, by boiling them first and immersing them {{in a mixture of}} vinegar, salt and spices, such as ginger or allspice. Frequently, <b>beetroot</b> <b>juice</b> is added to impart a red color to the eggs. If the eggs are immersed in it for a few hours, the distinct red, white, and yellow colors can be seen when the eggs are sliced. If marinated for several days or more, the red color will reach the yolk. If the eggs are marinated in the mixture for several weeks or more, the vinegar will dissolve much of the shell's calcium carbonate and penetrate the egg, making it acidic enough to inhibit the growth of bacteria and molds. Pickled eggs made this way will generally keep {{for a year or more}} without refrigeration.|$|E

The two cultures demonstrated better fermentative activity in the mixture of tested substrates, while acidifying activity (production of lactic acid and a decrease in pH) of the L. acidophilus BGSJ 15 - 3 culture was considerably better than that of the L. plantarum A 112 culture. L. plantarum A 112 culture showed better growth than L. acidophilus BGSJ 15 - 3. From the results obtained, it has been concluded that the L. plantarum A 112 and L. acidophilus BGSJ 15 - 3 can be successfully used for fermentation of the mixture of <b>beetroot</b> <b>juice</b> and brewer’s yeast autolysate in order to obtain a functional food additive...|$|E

The aims {{of the present study}} were to assess the phytochemical constituents of red <b>beetroot</b> <b>juice</b> and to measure the postprandial glucose and insulin responses elicited by either 225 ml <b>beetroot</b> <b>juice</b> (BEET), a control beverage matched for macronutrient content (MCON) or a glucose beverage in healthy adults. <b>Beetroot</b> <b>juice</b> was a particularly rich source of betalain degradation compounds. The orange/yellow pigment neobetanin was measured in particularly high quantities (providing 1 · 3 g in the 225 ml). A total of sixteen healthy individuals were recruited, and consumed the test meals in a controlled single-blind cross-over design. Results revealed a significant lowering of the postprandial insulin response in the early phase (0 – 60 min) (P < 0 · 05) and a significantly lower glucose response in the 0 – 30 min phase (P < 0 · 05) in the BEET treatment compared with MCON. Betalains, polyphenols and dietary nitrate found in the <b>beetroot</b> <b>juice</b> may each contribute to the observed differences in the postprandial insulin concentration...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundDietary {{inorganic}} nitrate (NO 3 −) and its reduced forms nitrite (NO 2 −) and {{nitric oxide}} (NO), respectively, are {{of critical importance}} for host defense in the oral cavity. High concentrations of salivary nitrate are linked to a lower prevalence of caries due to growth inhibition of cariogenic bacteria. ObjectiveIn-vitro {{studies suggest that the}} formation of antimicrobial NO results in an increase of the pH preventing erosion of tooth enamel. The {{purpose of this study was}} to prove this effect in-vivo. MethodsIn a randomized clinical study with 46 subjects we investigated whether NO 3 − rich <b>beetroot</b> <b>juice</b> exhibits a protective effect against caries by an increase of salivary pH. ResultsOur results show that, in comparison to a placebo group, consumption of <b>beetroot</b> <b>juice</b> that contains 4000  mg/L NO 3 − results in elevated levels of salivary NO 2 −, nitrite NO 3 −, and NO. Furthermore, we determined an increase of the mean pH of saliva from 7. 0 to 7. 5, confirming the anti-cariogenic effect of the used NO 3 −-rich <b>beetroot</b> <b>juice.</b> ConclusionsTaken together, we have found that NO 3 −-rich <b>beetroot</b> <b>juice</b> holds potential effects against dental caries by preventing acidification of human saliva.

J., East Stroudsburg University, East Stroudsburg, PA Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} dietary nitrate (NO 3 -) in the form of <b>beetroot</b> <b>juice</b> may enhance particular physiological responses that result in improvement in aerobic exercise performance. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of <b>beetroot</b> <b>juice</b> on fatigue, peak power output (PPO), mean power output (MPO), delta blood lactate (ΔHLA), and oxygen uptake (VO 2) during a repeated-sprint test (10 x 6 second sprints interspersed with 30 second recovery periods) in active males aged 18 - 24 years. Methods: Thirteen recreationally active, healthy males participated in the study. Subjects were assigned in a double-blind randomized, crossover design consuming 70 ml of <b>beetroot</b> <b>juice</b> (1 shot) containing. 4 -. 5 g of NO 3 - or a nitrate depleted placebo 2. 5 h prior to testing. A 10 -day wash-out was completed during the crossover. During testing days, subjects completed a standardized warm-up followed by 10 - 6 s repeated-sprints on a cycle ergometer interspersed with 30 s passive recovery periods. Results: Statistical analysis (p≤ 0. 05) found no significant difference in mean VO 2, ΔHLA, PPO, MPO, and fatigue between treatments. Conclusion: In conclusion, the present study showed that there was no significant difference in fatigue during a repeated-sprint cycling test after acute supplementation with <b>beetroot</b> <b>juice</b> (~ 5 mmol of NO 3 -), The researchers believe that the low acute dose of <b>beetroot</b> <b>juice</b> and/or differences in data reduction between previous studies and the current study may be possible explanations for the lack of effect on performance...|$|E
