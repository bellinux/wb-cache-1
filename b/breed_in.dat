5|$|The time of {{breeding}} {{depends on the}} elevation and latitude of the salamander's habitat. Generally, the lower-elevation salamanders <b>breed</b> <b>in</b> the fall, winter, and early spring. Higher-elevation salamanders <b>breed</b> <b>in</b> spring and early summer. In the higher climates especially, salamanders will enter ponds and lakes that still have ice floating.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{developed}} in the Cleveland district of Yorkshire, England, the Cleveland Bay {{is said to be}} the oldest established English horse breed, and the only horse native to Britain that does not belong to the heavy horse group. The closest <b>breed</b> <b>in</b> type, although completely unrelated, is the Irish Draught.|$|E
50|$|The {{woodchat shrike}} <b>breeds</b> <b>in</b> {{southern}} Europe, the Middle East and northwest Africa, and winters in tropical Africa. It <b>breeds</b> <b>in</b> open cultivated country, preferably with orchard trees and some bare or sandy ground.|$|R
25|$|In 2011, a {{study found}} that herding dogs were more trainable than hounds, working dogs, toy dogs and non-{{sporting}} dogs. The sporting dogs were more trainable than non-sporting dogs. Terriers were bolder than hounds and herding dogs. Breeds with ancient Asian or African origin were less trainable than <b>breeds</b> <b>in</b> the herding/sighthound cluster and the Hunting <b>breeds.</b> <b>Breeds</b> <b>in</b> the mastiff/terrier cluster were bolder than the ancient <b>breeds,</b> the <b>breeds</b> <b>in</b> the herding/sighthound cluster, and the hunting breeds.|$|R
50|$|The West African Dwarf goat breed from coastal West and Central Africa is the {{progenitor}} of the African Pygmy and Nigerian Dwarf <b>breeds</b> <b>in</b> the United States, and the Dutch Dwarf and Pygmy goat <b>breeds</b> <b>in</b> Great Britain. This <b>breed</b> probably evolved <b>in</b> {{response to}} the conditions in the humid forests of West and Central Africa.|$|R
5|$|Terns are {{normally}} monogamous, although trios or female-female pairings {{have been observed}} {{in at least three}} species. Most terns breed annually {{and at the same time}} of year, but some tropical species may nest at intervals shorter than 12 months or asynchronously. Most terns become sexually mature when aged three, although some small species may <b>breed</b> <b>in</b> their second year. Some large sea terns, including the sooty and bridled terns, are four or older when they first breed. Terns normally <b>breed</b> <b>in</b> colonies, and are site-faithful if their habitat is sufficiently stable. A few species nest in small or dispersed groups, but most <b>breed</b> <b>in</b> colonies of up to a few hundred pairs, often alongside other seabirds such as gulls or skimmers. Large tern species tend to form larger colonies, which in the case of the sooty tern can contain up to two million pairs. Large species nest very close together and sit tightly, making it difficult for aerial predators to land among them. Smaller species are less closely packed and mob intruders. Peruvian and Damara terns have small dispersed colonies and rely on the cryptic plumage of the eggs and young for protection.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Forest breed is {{very popular}} in Norway and Sweden. Since 2003, {{it has been the}} fifth most popular cat <b>breed</b> <b>in</b> France, where there are about 400 to 500 births per year.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{remains one}} of the most popular worldwide, {{primarily}} for its temperament and relatively small size. As of 2016 it is the 17th most popular <b>breed</b> <b>in</b> the U.S.|$|E

50|$|The pin-tailed {{sandgrouse}} <b>breeds</b> <b>in</b> North Africa and the Middle East, Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Kazakhstan. <b>In</b> Europe it <b>breeds</b> <b>in</b> Spain, Portugal {{and the southern}} part of France. Eastern populations, particularly those from Kazakhstan, migrate to Pakistan and parts of northern India in winter.|$|R
50|$|This species <b>breeds</b> <b>in</b> {{ponds and}} lakes.|$|R
5|$|The {{common and}} Asian house martins have {{sometimes}} been {{considered to be}} a single species, although both <b>breed</b> <b>in</b> the western Himalayas without hybridising. There is also limited DNA evidence that suggests a significant genetic distance between these two martins.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon lives mostly along mountain ranges, river valleys, coastlines, and increasingly in cities. In mild-winter regions, {{it is usually}} a permanent resident, and some individuals, especially adult males, will remain on the breeding territory. Only populations that <b>breed</b> <b>in</b> Arctic climates typically migrate great distances during the northern winter.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{great deal}} of variety among Labradors. The {{following}} characteristics are typical of the conformation show bred (bench-bred) lines of this <b>breed</b> <b>in</b> the United States and are based on the American Kennel Club standard. Significant differences between UK and US standards are noted.|$|E

50|$|It <b>breeds</b> <b>in</b> lowland forest {{streams and}} rivers.|$|R
50|$|The fly <b>breeds</b> <b>in</b> {{large numbers}} in dung pads. Larvae {{have been found}} in the feces of large mammals. The species {{continually}} <b>breeds</b> <b>in</b> subtropical Australia, and migrations help repopulate Australia and Tasmania each spring. In a study, a mixture of levamisole and oxfendazole killed larvae in sheep feces.|$|R
5|$|Two {{members of}} the British Royal Family {{influenced}} {{the evolution of the}} <b>breed.</b> <b>In</b> 1767, Queen Charlotte, Queen-consort of King George III of England, brought two Pomeranians to England.|$|E
5|$|After 55 to 65 days, juveniles reach full adult {{measurements}} and battle among themselves until a dominant juvenile forces its siblings {{to leave the}} natal area. The dominant bird remains with its parents until the following season, while its siblings leave the natal territory to join an unrelated pair who failed to <b>breed.</b> <b>In</b> a study by Dan Strickland, two-thirds of dominant juveniles were male.|$|E
5|$|An ephemeral/fluctuating pool natural {{community}} {{known as}} the Edgewood Vernal Pools is located on and near Nescopeck Mountain. It consists of dozens of vernal pools created by glaciation. Numerous amphibian species <b>breed</b> <b>in</b> the pools and hardwood trees and hemlock are present on {{the southern edge of}} the pool system. A globally rare species of invertebrate was observed in the pools in 1990. Another system of vernal pools {{known as the}} Briggsville Vernal Pools are found north of the ridge.|$|E
5000|$|The double-banded plover (Charadrius bicinctus), {{known as}} the banded {{dotterel}} in New Zealand, is a species of bird in the plover family. Two subspecies are recognised: the nominate Charadrius bicinctus bicinctus <b>breeds</b> <b>in</b> New Zealand, and the Chatham Islands while Charadrius bicinctus exilis <b>breeds</b> <b>in</b> the Auckland Islands.|$|R

5|$|Between 1918 and 1922, over 350 Percherons were {{imported}} to Britain from France and, {{combined with}} stock from the US and Canada, {{were used as}} breeding stock to establish the <b>breed</b> <b>in</b> the country. In 1918, the British Percheron Horse Society was formed. British breeders and owners continue to import Percherons from France, and also occasionally from Canada, when not prohibitively expensive.|$|E
5|$|Choughs <b>breed</b> <b>in</b> mountains, from Morocco and Spain eastwards through {{southern}} Europe and the Alps, across Central Asia and the Himalayas {{to western}} China. The Alpine chough {{is also found}} in Corsica and Crete, and the red-billed chough has populations in Ireland, the UK, the Isle of Man, and two areas of the Ethiopian Highlands. Both species are non-migratory residents throughout their range, only occasionally wandering to neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|Crested and marbled newts {{live and}} <b>breed</b> <b>in</b> vegetation-rich ponds or similar aquatic {{habitats}} {{for two to}} six months and usually {{spend the rest of}} the year in shady, protection-rich land habitats close to their breeding sites. Males court females with a ritualised display, ending in the deposition of a spermatophore that is picked up by the female. After fertilisation, a female lays 200–400 eggs, folding them individually into leaves of water plants. Larvae develop over two to four months before metamorphosing into land-dwelling juveniles.|$|E

40|$|Differences between {{reciprocal}} crosses {{are the result}} of <b>breed</b> differences <b>in</b> prenatal maternal effects and/or <b>breed</b> differences <b>in</b> postnatal maternal effects. <b>Breed</b> differences <b>in</b> postnatal maternal effects are well documented and are mediated through <b>breed</b> differences <b>in</b> milk production and perhaps through other maternal factors. <b>Breed</b> differences <b>in</b> prenatal maternal effects have received less attention by research interests than <b>breed</b> differences <b>in</b> postnatal maternal effects. <b>Breed</b> differences <b>in</b> prenatal maternal effects may be caused by either differences in ovum cytoplasm or by differences in uterine environment or by both. In most reports of experimental results, the prenatal and postnatal components of maternal effects have been confounded, as is the case for the results reported here...|$|R
