5|$|The first {{recorded}} {{use of the}} term <b>Borders</b> Railway to describe the reopened line was in a paper by the Corus Rail Consultancy in January 2004, entitled Delivering an innovative <b>Borders</b> Railway, which had been commissioned by the Waverley Route Trust. Previously, the Edinburgh–Tweedbank line had been variously described as the Waverley Railway and the <b>Borders</b> Rail Link. In mid-2014, Transport Scotland considered launching a competition for the public to submit their ideas for a name but the Scottish <b>Borders</b> Council was strongly opposed on the basis that <b>Borders</b> Railway had developed a strong brand identity. The use of Waverley Line or Waverley Route for the line was considered historically inaccurate by the Council and the Campaign for <b>Borders</b> Rail since these names were only ever used for the whole of the original line as far as Carlisle.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we generalize {{the notion}} of <b>border</b> bases of zero-dimensional {{polynomial}} ideals to the module setting. To this end, we introduce order modules as a generalization of order ideals and module <b>border</b> bases of submodules with finite codimension in a free module as a generalization of <b>border</b> bases of zero-dimensional ideals {{in the first part}} of this paper. In particular, we extend the division algorithm for <b>border</b> bases to the module setting, show the existence and uniqueness of module <b>border</b> bases, and characterize module <b>border</b> bases analogously like <b>border</b> bases via the special generation property, <b>border</b> form modules, rewrite rules, commuting matrices, and liftings of <b>border</b> syzygies. Furthermore, we deduce Buchberger's Criterion for Module <b>Border</b> Bases and give an algorithm for the computation of module <b>border</b> bases that uses linear algebra techniques. In the second part, we further generalize {{the notion of}} module <b>border</b> bases to quotient modules. We then show the connection between quotient module <b>border</b> bases and special module <b>border</b> bases and deduce characterizations similar to the ones for module <b>border</b> bases. Moreover, we give an algorithm for the computation of quotient module <b>border</b> bases using linear algebra techniques, again. At last, we prove that subideal <b>border</b> bases are isomorphic to special quotient module <b>border</b> bases. This isomorphy immediately yields characterizations and an algorithm for the computation of subideal <b>border</b> bases. Comment: 65 page...|$|R
