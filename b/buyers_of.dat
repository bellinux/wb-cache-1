5|$|A study {{conducted}} at the Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS), at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) published in 2014 found that many car dealers are less than enthusiastic about plug-in vehicles. ITS conducted 43 interviews with six automakers and 20 new car dealers selling plug-in vehicles in California’s major metro markets. The study also analyzed national and state-level J.D. Power 2013 Sales Satisfaction Index (SSI) study data on customer satisfaction with new car dealerships and Tesla retail stores. The researchers found that <b>buyers</b> <b>of</b> plug-in electric vehicles were significantly less satisfied and rated the dealer purchase experience much lower than <b>buyers</b> <b>of</b> non-premium conventional cars, while Tesla Motors earned industry-high scores. According to the findings, plug-in buyers expect more from dealers than conventional buyers, including product knowledge and support that extends beyond traditional offerings.|$|E

The administrators, SV Partners, {{took control of the}} day-to-day running of the business, and searched for potential <b>buyers</b> <b>of</b> the business. Eagle Boys announced that trade would continue as normal at franchisee-operated outlets during the administration, and franchisees were told their fees were due as normal.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>buyers</b> <b>of</b> {{medicine}} {{made from}} slow lorises are middle- to upper-class women {{between the ages}} of 25 and 45 who primarily use loris rice wine tonic to alleviate the pain of childbirth. One bottle of wine is made by mixing rice wine with the carcasses of three dead animals. Minority groups in Cambodia also use loris-based medicine for treating broken bones, asthma, and sexually transmitted diseases. A survey by primatologist Anna Nekaris etal. (2010) showed that these belief systems were so strong that the majority of respondents expressed reluctance to consider alternatives to loris-based medicines.|$|E

5|$|A soundtrack album, Soma Bringer Original Soundtrack, was {{released}} through the Sleigh Bells label on April 2, 2008. The soundtrack covers three discs. In addition to tracks used in-game, the album includes four tracks with full orchestral versions of particular tracks. Ben Schweitzer, writing for RPGFan, positively compared the score to earlier works by Mitsuda, calling it his best recent soundtrack despite some tracks being overly similar to earlier work. Don Kotowski of Video Game Music Online gave the soundtrack album a perfect score of 5/5 stars. He frequently praised Mitsuda's style, and like Schweitzer {{noted that it}} often recalled his earlier work. He also praised the additional tracks for their richness and depth, finishing his review by {{saying that it was}} a soundtrack not to be missed by <b>buyers</b> <b>of</b> video game music.|$|E
5|$|Arulpragasam befriended {{students}} in the college's fashion, advertising and graphics departments. She met Justine Frischmann, front woman of the British band Elastica, through her friend Damon Albarn at an Air concert in 1999, and Frischmann commissioned Arulpragasama to create the cover art for the band's 2000 album, The Menace, and video document their American tour. Arulpragasam returned to Jaffna in 2001 to film a documentary on Tamil youth, {{but was unable to}} complete the project because she encountered harassment. In 2001, Arulpragasam's first public exhibition of paintings after graduating took place at the Euphoria Shop on London's Portobello Road. It featured graffiti art and spray-paint canvasses mixing Tamil political street art with images of London life and consumerist culture. The show was nominated for an Alternative Turner Prize and a monograph book of the collection was published in 2002, titled M.I.A.. Actor Jude Law was among early <b>buyers</b> <b>of</b> her art.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} weekend of sale, {{more than one million}} units were sold. Soon after {{the first weekend}}, Ashok Kumar, a {{technology}} analyst for a financial firm predicted that Apple would sell 35 million iPad 2s in 2011. Investment banking firm, Piper Jaffray monitored the initial sales of the iPad 2 and reported that 70% of all iPad 2 sales were to first-time iPad buyers with 49% of buyers owning a PC compared to the initial <b>buyers</b> <b>of</b> the original iPad where only 26% of buyers owned a PC. 12,000 units were sold on auction site eBay in its first two weeks of release. When the iPhone 4S was released, rumors about the third generation iPad caused a decline in iPad 2 sales. Official figures released {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2011 indicate that Apple sold 11.4 million iPads in the third quarter, a 166% increase from the third quarter of 2010.|$|E

5|$|The hotel {{closed in}} 2000 after Occupational Safety and Health Administration {{building}} inspectors found safety problems during a 1999 inspection. The building's owner, Heaven on Earth Inns Corp, run by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, looked into several options before selling {{the property to}} Rubloff, Inc., which in 2001 announced plans to convert the building into condominiums priced as high as $8.5million. Rubloff's plans were unsuccessful due to financing difficulties and a lackluster market for <b>buyers</b> <b>of</b> Blackstone condominiums. Even two rounds of price cuts were not enough to spur interest in the condo opportunities and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's non-profit organization was unable to obtain financing.|$|E
5|$|After his death, {{the court}} ruled that Van Meegeren’s estate be {{auctioned}} and the proceeds from his property and the sale of his counterfeits be used to refund the <b>buyers</b> <b>of</b> his works and to pay income taxes on the sale of his paintings. Van Meegeren filed for bankruptcy in December 1945. On 5 and 6 September 1950, the furniture and other possessions in his Amsterdam house at Keizersgracht 321 were auctioned by order of the court, along with 738 other pieces of furniture and works of art, including numerous paintings by old and new masters from his private collection. The house was auctioned separately on 4 September, estimated to be worth 65,000 guilders. The proceeds of the sale together with the house amounted to 123,000 guilders. Van Meegeren’s unsigned The Last Supper I was bought for 2,300 guilders, while Jesus among the Doctors (which van Meegeren had painted while in detention) sold for 3,000 guilders (about $800 or about $7,000 today.) Today the painting hangs in a Johannesburg church. The sale of the entire estate amounted to 242,000 guilders ($60,000, or about $500,000 today).|$|E
5|$|In early 2007, {{the band}} {{announced}} a new World Tour, their first {{for nearly a decade}} to include dates outside North America or Japan. The band performed at London's Hard Rock Cafe in February 2007 to promote their European tour which included a night in Hyde Park as part of the Hyde Park Calling festival sponsored by Hard Rock Cafe. In the spring, the band toured Latin America to sold-out stadium crowds. In the summer, the band toured Europe, performing at several major rock festivals and visiting some countries they had never played before. Additionally, the band played in Middle East countries such as the United Arab Emirates and India for the first time. The band also played a few select dates in California and Canada in late July. The July 21 concert in Prince Edward Island, was the largest in that province's history. In September, the band performed eight dates in major markets in Northeastern North America. These shows were opened by Joan Jett. The band also played a private gig in Hawaii. A public show in Maui was canceled for logistical reasons, which spurred a class action lawsuit against the band. In April 2009, Aerosmith agreed to compensate all ticket <b>buyers</b> <b>of</b> the canceled show with a free ticket to a rescheduled Maui show to be held on October 20, 2009, along with reimbursements of all out-of-pocket expenses related to the show.|$|E
