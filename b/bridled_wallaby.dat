40|$|Non-invasive {{methods of}} {{monitoring}} wild populations (such as genotyping faeces or hair) are now widely used and advocated. The potential advantages of such methods over traditional direct monitoring (such as live capture) are that accuracy improves because sampling of non-trappable individuals may be possible, species in difficult and remote terrain can be surveyed more efficiently, and disturbance to animals is minimal. Few studies have assessed {{the effects of}} interactions between species on remote sampling success. We test the use of non-invasive monitoring for the cryptic, forest-dwelling, solitary and endangered <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallaby</b> (Onychogalea fraenata) that is sympatric with the ecologically similar and more common black-striped wallaby (Macropus dorsalis). Six types of hair traps were tested for 3668 trap days, and hairs were caught with about a 10 % success rate. Camera traps showed that baited hair traps targeted both wallaby species. We microscopically identified hair as <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallaby</b> or black-striped wallaby. We compared these hairs and their genotypes (using seven microsatellite loci) with known <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallaby</b> hairs and genotypes derived from animal trapping. Trapped <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallaby</b> hairs had characteristics that could be mistaken for black-stripe wallaby hairs; characteristics were not diagnostic. Genetic assignment tests consistently differentiated the known <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallaby</b> samples from identified black-striped wallaby samples, however genetic overlap between most of the microsatellite markers means {{that they are not}} suitable for species identification of single samples, {{with the possible exception of}} the microsatellite locus B 151. With similar trapping effort and within the same area, live-capture mark-recapture techniques estimated 40 - 60 individuals and non-invasive methods only detected 14 genotypes.

40|$|The <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallaby,</b> Onychogalea fraenata, is a {{relatively}} small, solitary and sexually size dimorphic macropod. We studied the mating system of free-ranging wallabies over 3 years, using microsatellite analysis of paternity, radiotelemetry and behavioural observations. Both sexes were promiscuous, and general reproductive behaviour {{was similar to that}} of larger, better-known macropods. Home range size influenced the number of associations with oestrous females, and was a significant component of male reproductive success. Female population density varied within the site, but males with home ranges that overlapped more females did not sire more offspring. Aggression between males occurred only around oestrous females and males did not establish a predetermined dominance hierarchy. Male body weight strongly influenced priority of access to oestrous females, and was related to age. The number of times that males were seen closest to an oestrous female when other males were present (priority of access) was the most important predictor of variation in the number of offspring sired. Females mated with several males within and between oestrous cycles, and may have influenced male–male competition by prolonging advertisement of approaching oestrus, expanding their home ranges at oestrus and engaging in mate chases that attracted groups of up to six males. Despite overall similarities in the mating system of this species and that of other macropods, male mating success may be less skewed in <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallabies</b> than in other species, although paternity analysis of free-ranging populations of other species is required to confirm this conclusion...|$|R

5000|$|In 1973 a <b>bridled</b> nail-tail <b>wallaby</b> was sighted on {{a cattle}} {{property}} named 'Taunton' and reported by a fencing contractor.

[...] Causes for the original population decline are complex, but are generally thought to have arisen {{from a combination of}} interacting factors including predation and drought.

40|$|Many {{species have}} {{suffered}} severe range contractions {{as a result}} of human impacts, and require careful management if they are to persist. An understanding of the ecology, population structure and mating system is important for the conservation of these endangered species. Translocation has become a widely used tool in the conservation of threatened species; however, without proper planning and monitoring, many programmes end in failure. The <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallaby</b> {{is one of the most}} endangered macropods in Australia, having suffered an extensive range contraction from the semi-arid region of eastern Australia to a single remnant population of ~ 500 animals at Taunton National Park in Queensland. In 1996, a translocated population of <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallabies</b> was established at Idalia National Park, on the western edge of the former range of this species. The aims of this study were to: 1) determine the factors underlying variation in reproductive success among animals released at Idalia; 2) investigate the effects of a range decline on the genetic variation and population structure of the remnant population at Taunton; 3) assess the impact of captive breeding and translocation on the genetic diversity and structure of the established population at Idalia; and 4) investigate male and female mating strategies in this species. Chapter two investigated reproductive success among males released at Idalia National Park. The <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallaby</b> is a sexually dimorphic, polygynous species and there is a large amount of variation in male reproductive success. Animals of different origin were released, including animals bred in captivity off the park, animals bred on-site in enclosures, and wild-caught animals from the remnant population that were moved directly to Idalia. There was significant variation in reproductive success among males released, but the origin of those animals did not explain this variation. Instead, large males were the most reproductively successful regardless of origin. Survival probability and release location were also important factors. This study highlighted the importance of considering mating system when choosing animals for translocation and suggests that, for polygynous species, a greater proportion of females and males of high breeding potential should be released. In Chapter three I investigated the genetic diversity and fine-scale genetic structure of the remnant population at Taunton. This last remaining population has been isolated for at least 60 years, corresponding to 30 generations for this species. Animals are patchily distributed in assemblages of different size that cover ~ 10 % of suitable habitat on the park. Genetic diversity was surprisingly high within the population remnant and this species showed one of the highest levels of heterozygosity and allelic diversity of any macropod. The three sub-populations of animals sampled over 10 km were significantly differentiated, and fine-scale spatial genetic structure was also observed within a continuous sub-population of animals covering just 750 ha. Females were more related to each other than expected from random, whereas males were less related to each other than expected. Fine-scale genetic structure was observed among females but not males, providing evidence for female philopatry and male-biased dispersal. I suggest that fine-scale population structure and restricted gene flow among females but not males may maintain genetic diversity in this remnant population. Chapter four assessed the effect of translocation of animals of different origin on genetic diversity in <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallabies.</b> Both wild-caught and captive-bred animals were initially released, but subsequent releases consisted of captive-bred animals only. In this study, I compared genetic diversity of released animals to animals sampled in the remnant population. Heterozygosity did not differ between the remnant and translocated population, however allelic diversity was significantly reduced among all groups released. Animals bred in captivity were significantly differentiated from the source population, whereas animals moved directly from Taunton were not. Releasing more captive-bred animals into the population after the initial release resulted in a decline in overall heterozygosity and allelic diversity. This study highlights the importance of sourcing animals directly from remnant populations in order to maintain genetic diversity and minimize genetic drift between source and recipient populations. The <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallaby</b> has a polygynous mating system and reproductive success is skewed toward large males. However unlike most polygynous, sexually dimorphic macropods, the <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallaby</b> is highly solitary; animals only associate to breed and males do not form stable dominance hierarchies. In Chapter five I investigated behavioural strategies used by males to secure matings, and mate choice among females. I found that males of different size adopted different mating strategies. Large males spent more time guarding females against other males and maintaining contact with them, whereas smaller males spent less time with guarded females in order to search for other females in oestrus. Females also preferred larger males and were more likely to engage in mate chases if there was a large number of males within the group...|$|R
40|$|Loss {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} and increased population differentiation from source populations are common {{problems associated with}} translocation programmes established from captive-bred stock or {{a small number of}} founders. The <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallaby</b> {{is one of the most}} endangered macropods in Australia, having been reduced to a single remnant population in the last 100 years. A translocated population of <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallabies</b> was established using animals sourced directly from the remnant population (wild-released) as well as the progeny of animals collected for a captive breeding programme (captive-bred). The aims of this study were to compare genetic diversity among released animals and their wild-born progeny to genetic diversity observed in the remnant population, and to monitor changes in genetic diversity over time as more animals were released into the population. Heterozygosity did not differ between the translocated and remnant population; however, allelic diversity was significantly reduced across all released animals and their wild-born progeny. Animals bred in captivity and their wild-born progeny were also significantly differentiated from the source population after just four generations. Wild-released animals, however, were representative of the source population and several alleles were unique to this group. Both heterozygosity and allelic diversity among translocated animals decreased over time with the additional release of captive-bred animals, as no new genetic stock was added to the population. Captive breeding programmes can provide large numbers of animals for release, but this study highlights the importance of sourcing animals directly from remnant populations in order to maintain genetic diversity and minimise genetic drift...|$|R
40|$|Translocation is an {{important}} tool {{for the conservation of}} species that have suffered severe range reductions. The success of a translocation should be measured not only by the survival of released animals, but by the reproductive output of individuals and hence the establishment of a self-sustaining population. The <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallaby</b> is an endangered Australian macropod that suffered an extensive range contraction to a single remaining wild population. A translocated population was established and subsequently monitored over a four year period. The aim {{of this study was to}} measure the reproductive success of released males using genetic tools and to determine the factors that predicted reproductive success. Captive-bred and wild-caught animals were released and we found significant variation in male reproductive success among release groups. Variation in reproductive success was best explained by individual male weight, survival and release location rather than origin. Only 26 % of candidate males were observed to sire an offspring during the study. The <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallaby</b> is a sexually dimorphic, polygynous macropod and reproductive success is skewed toward large males. Males over 5800 g were six times more likely to sire an offspring than males below this weight. This study highlights the importance of considering mating system when choosing animals for translocation. Translocation programs for polygynous species should release a greater proportion of females, and only release males of high breeding potential. By maximizing the reproductive output of released animals, conservation managers will reduce the costs of translocation and increase the chance of successfully establishing a self-sustaining population.

40|$|Several {{behavioral}} {{studies of}} large, gregarious, and sexually dimorphic macropods {{have shown that}} males form dominance hierarchies and large males have the highest reproductive success. The <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallaby</b> (Onychogalea fraenata) is a smaller and strongly sexually dimorphic macropod, but is also highly solitary and males do not form dominance hierarchies that are maintained temporally or spatially. Genetic studies of paternity have shown that large males are the most reproductively successful and only one-quarter of males sire offspring at any one time. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the tactics that males adopt to secure access to females at the time of estrus and to investigate whether females can influence which males have access to them. This study was conducted using 2 wild, free-ranging populations of <b>bridled</b> nailtail <b>wallabies.</b> Females in estrus were located and observed. and the total number of males present, the relative weight rank of each mate, and interactions between individuals were recorded. Females showed a preference for large males and incited male-male competition when the group of males present was large. Unlike other dimorphic macropods, fights among males were rare and were restricted to males of similar size. Large males gained access to females by guarding and following them closely and threatening other males who attempted to gain access. Smaller males spent less time with females, suggesting that small males may leave multimale groups in an attempt to locate unguarded females. Given the solitary nature of this species and the lack of a stable dominance hierarchy to influence male reproductive success. mate searching and mate guarding may be important male reproductive tactics in this species...|$|R
