40|$|The {{following}} report documents a California Polytechnic State University, Mechanical Engineering Senior Project {{sponsored by}} the gas turbine manufacturer, Solar Turbines. The senior project team consisted of four senior mechanical engineering students at Cal Poly, all with general concentrations; Ryan Bruce, Carolyn Honeycutt, Steve Oltrogge, and Emmett Ross. Kenneth Thomas sponsored the group and serves as the point of contact between the senior project team and Solar Turbines. He {{is a member of}} the Solar Turbines Mechanical Design Engineering Team and a Cal Poly graduate. Christoph Maurer served as the project team’s on-campus advisor. A gas turbine uses internal combustion to produce output shaft work and can be broken down into a “cold” section and a “hot” section. The cold section is composed of the air inlet and the air compressor, while the hot section is composed of the burner, turbine, and diffuser. This project was focused on the compressor, specifically compressor blade installation. Solar Turbines’ T 130, Mars, and T 250 turbines all contain multi-stage compressors, meaning that many sets of compressor blades spin around a single shaft to continually compress the air as it nears the burner. Many of the compressor stages are installed using a ring method, where the compressor blades are slid into large slots around the compressor rotor, radially, and held into place, axially, by a large ring. These stages require additional hardware to restrain the blades radially. However, the first several stages of the compressor use axially installed fan blades, where each blade slides into an individual slot on the rotor disk and is held in place, radially by the geometry of the compressor. These stages therefore require additional hardware to restrain the axial movement of the blades. This is accomplished via small steel retainer tabs. This project focuses on the installation of these metal retainer tabs. The current process for installing the early stage compressor blades, those requiring retainer tabs, involves several, individual, time-consuming steps. Additionally, there are numerous tools required for each of these steps and every individual installation technician can have an additional, personal set of installation tools. As a result compressor blade installation is a lengthy and imprecise process that leads to inconsistencies and risks damaging the compressor rotor. The task for the Cal Poly senior project group was to design a tool(s) and a corresponding standardized process to bend these retainer tabs into position. The sponsor, Solar Turbines, owns all Intellectual Property for the tools designed during the course of the project. In return, they provided funding for the project, access to necessary company proprietary information, manufacturing support (as needed), and general project guidance. The overall aim of this project was to design a tool or set of tools that removed as much of the variation from compressor <b>blade</b> <b>retainer</b> tab installation as possible. As well as reduced the time spent installing blades, therefore reducing the risk of damage to the turbine blades and rotors from non-standardized processes and tooling. Additionally the team focused on minimizes the number of tools used in the overall process. The final tool design consisted of two tools, a “backing” and a “bending” tool. Each should decrease the installation time, increase consistency, are more ergonomic, and are safer than the current methods...|$|E
40|$|There was an {{incidence}} to {{an aircraft}} wherein after flight, pilot noticed “Decelerate Right Engine” caption on MFWS along with longitudinal thud. Also, there was momentary display of “Right Engine Vibration” caption. Following this, the pilot {{switched off the}} RH engine and the aircraft landed with one engine (port). Boroscopic examination of the affected engine revealed damages in the turbine area, mostly concentrated in and around LP turbine. On strip examination, {{it was found that}} the LPTR blades, and a labyrinth with the LP turbine disc were severely damaged. A few of these damaged components, viz., (a) fractured and dislodged labyrinth support ring of LP turbine disc, (b) fractured and dislodged labyrinth, (c) parts of LPTR disc containing the fracture surface, (d) LPTR blades, and (e) lock and pin of LPTR <b>blades</b> <b>retainer</b> ring were sent to this laboratory for establishing the probable cause(s) of failure. Examination revealed that the damages to LPTR blades were mostly confined to the tip region except for one where the blade had fractured in the airfoil at one-third height from the blade root platform. Evidences suggested that the damages to the LPTR blades were caused due to tip rubbing with the turbine casing. Fractographic examination confirmed that the fracture in all the blades was by overload. None of the blades showed any signatures of progressive failure. The damages on the lock and pin of LPTR <b>blades</b> <b>retainer</b> ring were also found to be secondary in nature. A part of the labyrinth was retrieved from the damaged engine. It was found mangled and separated from the labyrinth support ring with the LP turbine disc. No pins were available with the labyrinth. The fractured ends of the labyrinth were severely damaged. Fractographic examination showed dimple rupture wherever the fracture features were preserved, indicating failure under overload. The labyrinth support ring got completely separated from the LP turbine disc. Again, only a part of this ring was available for examination. But, the entire mating fracture surface of the ring was available with the disc. Fracture surface analysis showed that separation of the labyrinth support ring from the disc was by overload fracture. The force acted on the support ring was in the radial direction from outside to inside. Further examination of the separated labyrinth support ring showed presence of cracks in four pin holes, located in a sector adjacent to each other. The cracks were located at the edge of the holes on the free surface. It was confirmed through scanning electron fractographic study that these cracks were progressive in nature and they had propagated by fatigue mechanism. From the laboratory investigation, it could not be established whether or not these cracks have bearing on the separation of the labyrinth support ring from LP turbine disc. The presence of fatigue cracks, however, does indicate some distress at the pin holes originating either from assembly or during engine run. Considering the overall damages to various components of the engine in and around LP turbine and the laboratory investigation, it appears that the failure in the labyrinth was due to some location specific problem(s). Analysis also suggests that the overload fracture of labyrinth support ring is indicative of sudden overload on this component during the engine run. Although it was not possible to establish as to what caused this sudden overload, it is believed that the detachment of labyrinth support ring was the first in the chain of events that led to engine failure. In view of this, it is suggested that various possibilities that could lead to sudden overload on the labyrinth support ring of the LP turbine disc be investigated. It also needs to be investigated whether or not there could be any common cause(s) which is responsible for generation of fatigue cracks at the pin holes as well as the separation of the labyrinth support ring from LP turbine disc. Laboratory test results showed that the materials used for fabrication of the components in question conform to specification in terms of chemical composition. No comments can be offered on the microstructure and hardness parameters because of the insufficient data made available to this laboratory. However, based on the overall understanding of the failure, any metallurgical abnormality leading to separation of the labyrinth support ring appears to be a remote possibility...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} has been done to observe the effect of varying the retainer angle on the performance of oil burner in terms of exhaust gas emissions and temperatures. Retainer was a flame stabilizer used to stabilize the flame, improve mixing between air and fuel and affect the formation of emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), oxides of nitrogen (NOX), and sulfur dioxide (SO 2). These emissions can cause harm to the world ecosystem. One of the methods to reduce emissions was by varying the <b>retainer's</b> <b>blade</b> angle to certain angle that complete the combustion with high efficiencies and less emissions. In this research, an oil burner with four different retainer angles has been investigated using a combustor of one meter length. Tests were conducted using diesel as feedstock. Four different retainer angles used are 15 °, 30 ° (baseline), 45 °, and 60 ° with swirl number 0. 2016, 0. 4344, 0. 7524, and 1. 3032. From the experiment, data shown that swirling flow affect the formation of recirculation zone thus provides the aerodynamics blockage to stabilize the flame and emissions reduced due to varying the retainer angles and the best retainer angle was achieved by consider the exhaust gas emission reduction...|$|R
40|$|A unique {{configuration}} of the P&W SSME Alternate Fuel Turbopump turbine disk/blade assembly, combined with a severe thermal environment, resulted in several structural anomalies that were driven by frictional contact forces. Understanding the mechanics of these problems provides new quality checks for future turbo machinery designs. During development testing in 1997 of the SSME alternate fuel turbopump at Stennis Space Center, several potentially serious problems surfaced with the turbine disk/blade assembly {{that had not been}} experienced in extensive earlier testing. Changes to the operational thermal environment were noted based on analytical prediction of modifications that affected performance and on stationary thermal measurements adjacent to the rotor assembly. A detailed structural investigation was required to reveal the mechanism of distress induced by the change. The turbine disk experienced cracking in several locations due to increased thermal gradient induced stress during start and shutdown transients. This was easily predictable using standard analysis procedures and expected once the thermal environment was characterized. What was not expected was the curling of a piston ring used for blade axial retention in the disk, indentation of the axial face of the blade attachment by a spacer separating the first and second stage blades, and most significantly, galling and cracking of the blade root attachment that could have resulted in blade release. Past experience, in gas turbine environments, set a precedent of never relying on friction for help and to evaluate it only in specific instances where it was obvious that it would degrade capability. In each of the three cases above, friction proved to be a determining factor that pushed the components into an unsatisfactory mode of operation. The higher than expected temperatures and rapid thermal transients combined with friction to move beyond past experience. The turbine disk/blade assembly configuration contributed to the potential for these problems to occur by limiting the radial deflection from thermals and centrifugal loading. The cooled solid bore configuration was chosen to improve rotordynamic stability by limiting the length of rotor overhang while still protecting the roller bearing by maintaining zero slope under the inner race. During a start transient, the rim area of the disk heats rapidly and expands axially and circumferentially and requires corresponding radial and axial growth of the disk to maintain relative positioning of the disk, <b>blades,</b> spacers and <b>retainer</b> rings. The stiffness, large thermal mass, and bore cooling flow combine to severely limit the disk rim radial growth which results in the potential for relative movement between these parts. Friction then becomes a player in the determination of component stress...|$|R
