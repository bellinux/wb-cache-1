5|$|Allen and {{his family}} moved to Burlington in 1787, which was no longer a small {{frontier}} settlement <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> town, and much more to Allen's liking than the larger community that Bennington had become. He frequented the tavern there, and began work on An Essay on the Universal Plenitude of Being, which he characterized as an appendix to Reason. This essay was less polemic than many of his earlier writings. He affirmed the perfection of God and His creation, and credited intuition as well as reason as a way to bring Man closer to the universe. The work was not published until long after his death, and is primarily of interest to students of Transcendentalism, a movement the work foreshadows.|$|E

Loring was primarily home to active duty units, although this changed in the 1980s, when the Massachusetts Air National Guard's 101st Fighter Squadron sent a detachment to Loring. As the base was the closest in the U.S. to Europe, it also functioned as an important stopover point.|$|E
5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E
5|$|The third Chinook carried {{half of the}} {{enhanced}} A Company group from 1 PARA to Magbeni. The helicopter hovered low above the landing zone that had been identified by the second SAS observation team and the paras jumped from the rear ramp. The observation team had warned that the ground was wet but {{had been unable to}} determine the depth of the water, so the paras were surprised to find themselves jumping into a chest-deep swamp. The majority of the first group immediately waded through the swamp to get to the nearby tree line and from there to the village, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> party tasked with securing the landing zone had to wait in the swamp for the Chinook to pick up the remaining members of the company group and return to insert them at the landing zone.|$|E

5|$|After the 2002 World Cup, {{the team}} {{weakened}} {{with the loss}} of more veterans and coach Waseige. They missed out five successive major finals from Euro 2004 until Euro 2012, and went through an equal number of head coaches. A 2005 win over reigning European champions Greece meant nothing <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> comfort. In between, a promising new generation was maturing at the 2007 European U-21 Championship; Belgium's squad qualified for the following year's Summer Olympics in Beijing, where the Young Red Devils squad finished fourth. Seventeen of them appeared in the senior national team, albeit without making an immediate impact. Belgium finished in second (and last) place at the Kirin Cup in May 2009, and lost against the 125th FIFA-ranked Armenian team in September 2009. After Georges Leekens' second stint as national manager, his assistant Marc Wilmots became the caretaker in May 2012.|$|E
5|$|Enthusiasts claim {{descent from}} the horses {{painted on the}} cave walls of Lascaux, though {{this has not been}} {{verified}} by scientific studies. Horses have been recorded in the area since at least the 10th century, and the regional type was preferred by magistrates and clergy in medieval times. The Poitevin breed as it is known today began to take shape in the early 17th century, as engineers began draining the French marshes and brought with them their draft horses, which were crossed with native horses. Since early in its history, the Poitevin has been used extensively for the breeding of mules, and although commonly called a draft horse, was not favored for agricultural purposes. During the 19th century, the population of the Poitevin increased, reaching 50,000 pure and crossbred mares by 1867. Crossbreeding with other draft breeds led to concerns about the purity of the Poitevin population, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> group of breeders worked to preserve the remaining purebred population.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this failure, the Belgians were asked to fall back to the Yser river and protect the Allied left flank and rear areas. The King's aide, General Overstraten said that such a move could not be made and {{would lead to the}} Belgian Army disintegrating. Another plan for further offensives was suggested. The French requested the Belgians withdraw to the Leie and the British to the French frontier between Maulde and Halluin, the Belgians were then to extend their front to free further parts of the BEF for the attack. The French 1st Army would relieve two more divisions on the right flank. Leopold was reluctant to undertake such a move because it would abandon all <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> portion of Belgium. The Belgian Army was exhausted and it was an enormous technical task that would take too long to complete.|$|E

5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro by participation. Shatilov participated in both the London and Beijing Olympics. He did not advance following the qualification round in the floor and horizontal bar events due to not achieving eighth place or higher in either. Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s nothing I can do about it. You {{need to know how}} to cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and wanted to have a good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. I started my floor drill well, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> mistake cost me and I knew I had no chance after that. I never imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.|$|E
5|$|Textual {{critics have}} had a {{challenging}} task in classifying the Codex, the exact relationship to other known texts and families is still disputed. The Greek text of the codex is of mixed text-types. It is {{a representative of the}} Byzantine text-type in the Gospels - the oldest examples of the type - {{and the rest of the}} New Testament books are of the Alexandrian text-type, with some Western readings. Kurt Aland placed it in Category III in the Gospels, and in Category I in rest of the books of the New Testament. The Byzantine text of the Gospels has a number of Alexandrian features, it has some affinities to the textual Family Π. Soden associated the text of the gospels with Family Π, though it is not a pure member of this family. According to Streeter, it is the earliest Greek manuscript which gives us approximately the text of Lucian the Martyr, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> proportion of the readings seem to be earlier.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of shipping and the docks started to decline after 1886, {{the year in}} which the opening of the Severn Tunnel caused a severe drop in coal imports by sea. The situation worsened as the railways were extended into Somerset and beyond, and ships became too big for the port. The last commercial use of the docks was when coal imports ceased on 31 July 1971, and although they now house a marina they are currently little used. The surrounding quays have been developed for housing, although the remains of wooden quays on the riverbank can still be seen. All <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> remnant of the mump (a huge mound of spoil from the original dock excavations) was removed in the 1980s {{to make way for the}} development on the north side of the dock. Due to the port, ship building was also an important industry, and around 140 ships were built in the town during the 19th century by companies including David Williams, Joseph Gough, Watsons and William Lowther. F J Carver and Son owned a small dry dock on East Quay and constructed the last ship to be built in the town— the Irene. The former associated industry of rope making is commemorated in street furnishings and paving on East Quay and in the name of Ropewalk street.|$|E
