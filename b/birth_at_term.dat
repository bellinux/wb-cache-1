40|$|Background: Preterm birth {{defined as}} birth prior to 37 weeks of {{gestation}} {{is caused by}} different risk factors and implies an increased risk for disease and early death for the child. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the effect of maternal stress during pregnancy on the risk of preterm birth. Methods: A case-control study that included 340 women; 168 women who gave birth preterm and 172 women who gave <b>birth</b> <b>at</b> <b>term.</b> Data were manually extracted from standardized medical records. If the medical record contained a psychiatric diagnosis or a self-reported stressor e. g., depression or anxiety the woman was considered to have been exposed to stress during pregnancy. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was used to calculate the attributable risk (AR) of maternal stress during pregnancy on preterm birth, both for the women exposed to stress during pregnancy (AR 1 = (AOR- 1) /AOR) and for the whole study population (AR 2 = AR 1 *case fraction). Results: Maternal stress during pregnancy was more common among women who gave birth preterm compared to women who gave <b>birth</b> <b>at</b> <b>term</b> (p &lt; 0. 000, AOR 2. 15 (CI = 1. 18 - 3. 92)). Among the women who experienced stress during pregnancy 54 % gave birth preterm with stress as an attributable risk factor. Among all of the women the percentage was 23 %. Conclusions: Stress seems to increase the risk of preterm birth. It is of great importance to identify and possibly alleviate the exposure to stress during pregnancy and by doing so try to decrease the preterm birth rate.

Design: secondary analyses using published data from the Euro-PERISTAT study. Setting and participants: women that gave birth in 2004 in the 29 European regions and countries called 'countries' included in the Euro-PERISTAT study (4, 328, 441 women in total and 1, 940, 977 women <b>at</b> <b>term).</b> Methods: odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for the comparison of perinatal mortality rates between European countries and the Netherlands, through logistic regression analyses using summary country data. Main outcome measures: combined perinatal mortality rates overall and <b>at</b> <b>term.</b> Perinatal deaths below 28 weeks, between 28 and 37 weeks and from 37 weeks onwards per 1000 total births. Findings: compared to the Netherlands, perinatal mortality rates <b>at</b> <b>term</b> were significantly higher for Denmark and Latvia and not significantly different compared to seven other countries. Eleven countries had a significantly lower rate, and for eight the term perinatal mortality rate could not be compared.

The controls included 1966 women who gave <b>birth</b> <b>at</b> <b>term</b> (≥ 37 weeks of gestation) to healthy infants on randomly selected days at the hospitals where cases had been identified. Results: There was inverse association for coffee consumption in the third trimester of pregnancy in SGA cases compared to NGA (heterogeneity test between OR: χ 12 P≤ 0. 05). In comparison with not drinkers, all the ORs of overall intake of caffeine were closed near the unity for both SGA and NGA preterm birth. Conclusion: Compared with no consumption, a low consumption of coffee during pregnancy may not have significant effects on preterm birth. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to compare effects of {{respiratory}} distress syndrome (RDS) on the myocardial function of newborn preterm infants and the later effects of chronic lung disease of prematurity on pulmonary artery stiffness in school age children. The first study in this thesis compared global and regional myocardial function in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) with preterm and term-born controls (30 with RDS, 30 preterm control ≤ 34 weeks, 60 term control) using conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography at <b>birth,</b> <b>at</b> <b>term,</b> one month, and one year of age. The second study compared the pulmonary artery stiffness, an early preclinical marker of pulmonary hypertension, in children (aged 8 - 12 years) who had chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) with preterm and term-born controls. Pulmonary artery pulse wave velocity (PA PWV) was assessed in 59 children: 13 with CLD, 21 preterm (≤ 32 weeks gestation) and 25 term controls) using velocity encoded MRI technique while breathing room air and after 20 minutes of breathing 12...|$|E
40|$|Background: Preterm birth {{associates}} with a substantially {{increased risk of}} later cardiovascular disease and neurodevelopmental disorders. Understanding underlying mechanisms will facilitate the development of screening and intervention strategies to reduce disease risk. Changes in DNA methylation have been proposed as one mechanism linking the early environment with later disease risk. We tested the hypothesis that preterm birth {{associates with}} altered DNA methylation in genes encoding insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF 2) and FK 506 binding protein 5 (FKBP 5), which appear particularly vulnerable to early life adversity. Methods: 50 preterm infants were seen and assessed <b>at</b> <b>birth,</b> <b>term</b> equivalent age, 3 months and 1 year corrected ages; 40 term infants were seen <b>at</b> <b>birth,</b> 3 months and 1 year. Saliva was collected for DNA extraction <b>at</b> <b>birth,</b> <b>term</b> and 1 year. Pyrosequencing of bisulfite converted DNA was performed to measure DNA methylation at specific CpG sites within the IGF 2 and FKBP 5 loci. Results: Weight and head circumference was reduced in preterm infants at all time points. Preterm infants had a higher percentage body fat <b>at</b> <b>term</b> corrected age but this difference was not persistent. DNA methylation at the differentially methylated region (DMR) of IGF 2 (IGF 2 DMR 2) and FKBP 5 was lower in preterm infants at birth/term corrected age compared to <b>term</b> infants <b>at</b> <b>birth.</b> IGF 2 DMR 2 and FKBP 5 methylation was related to birthweight standard deviation score in preterm infants. Amongst preterm infants, social deprivation was an independent contributor towards reducing DNA methylation at IGF 2 DMR 2 <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> and <b>term</b> corrected age and maternal smoking was associated with reduced DNA methylation at FKBP 5 <b>at</b> <b>birth.</b> There were no persistent differences in DNA methylation at 1 year of age. Conclusions: Changes in DNA methylation were identified at key regions of IGF 2 /H 19 and FKBP 5 in preterm infants in early life. Potential contributing factors include maternal smoking and social deprivation. However, these changes did not persist at one year of age and further longitudinal studies are required to determine any associations between altered DNA methylation in the perinatal period of individuals born preterm and their long-term health...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—Low {{birth weight}} is {{consistently}} {{associated with an}} increased risk of type 2 diabetes in adulthood, but the individual contributions from poor fetal growth and preterm birth are not known. We therefore investigated the significance of these two factors separately. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—We identified a co-hort of subjects born preterm or with low <b>birth</b> weight <b>at</b> <b>term</b> <b>at</b> four major delivery units in Sweden from 1925 through 1949. A comparison cohort of subjects was identified from the same source population. Of 6, 425 subjects in all, 2, 931 were born at 37 weeks of gestation and 2, 176 had a birth weight 2, 500 g. Disease occurrence among participants was assessed through nationwide hospital registers from 1987 through 2006. RESULTS—During follow-up, there were 508 cases of diabetes. Low birth weight was strongly negatively associated with risk o...|$|R
