5|$|Amira goes to Yusef for help, {{saying she}} needs him on her side, {{threatening}} to tell Zainab that Yusef <b>bought</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> plane ticket {{if he does}} not help her get Syed back. She convinces Zainab to talk to Yusef, and when Yusef sees 15-year-old Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe), who has recently come out as homosexual, running out of Christian's flat, he asks if Christian acted inappropriately. At first Ben says nothing happened but later Ben tells Yusef that Christian touched him, and they tell Ben's father, Phil.

On seeing her dedication and commitment in helping the poor and sick, Ursula <b>bought</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> 0.6-hectare piece of land at Jalan Payoh Lai in 1965, so that Hsu could open the first home for the aged sick in Singapore.

5|$|Mimi had {{relatives}} in Eketahuna, New Zealand, because her maternal aunt, Harriet Millward, had married and moved there. Mimi had exchanged letters with her relatives over the years, so Lennon {{arranged for a}} tour of New Zealand in 1964. The success of The Beatles caused problems for {{her and she was}} constantly pestered by fans at 'Mendips', so she sold the house for £6,000 in 1965; Lennon <b>bought</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> £25,000 bungalow by the beach called Harbour's Edge in Sandbanks, at 126 Panorama Road, Poole, Dorset, which was her home {{for the rest of her}} life. The Lennons and their son visited her there in the summer of 1965, which was the last time all three of them visited the house together. Lennon later gave his aunt his MBE medal, but later asked for it back so that he could return it in protest.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} of Ibsen's Ghost at Toole's Theatre in London {{was seen by}} William Archer, the translator of Ibsen's works into English. Apparently comfortable with the parody, he enjoyed the humour of the play and recommended it to others. Barrie's third play Walker, London (1892) resulted in him being introduced to a young actress named Mary Ansell. He proposed to her and they were married on 9 July 1894. Barrie <b>bought</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> Saint Bernard puppy, who {{played a part in}} the novel The Little White Bird. He used Ansell's given name for many characters in his novels. Barrie also authored Jane Annie, a comic opera for Richard D'Oyly Carte (1893), which unfortunately failed. He begged his friend Arthur Conan Doyle to revise and finish it for him.|$|E

In London, she took an advanced cooking course, but seldom cooked for her roommates. She took {{a series of}} low-paying jobs; {{she worked as a}} dance instructor for youth until a skiing accident caused her to miss three months of work. She then found employment as a playgroup pre-school assistant, did some cleaning work for her sister Sarah and several of her friends, and acted as a hostess at parties. Diana spent time working as a nanny for the Robertsons, an American family living in London, and worked as a nursery teacher's assistant at the Young England School in Pimlico. In July 1979, her mother <b>bought</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> flat at Coleherne Court in Earl's Court as an 18th birthday present. She lived there with three flatmates until 25 February 1981.|$|E

Her father <b>bought</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> microphone, a drum kit, a keyboard, and several guitars, and converted their basement into a studio; following his own love for music Jean-Claude led the family to church at Third Day Worship Center in Kingston, Ontario, where he often played bass.

500|$|When {{she passed}} her driving test, Lennon {{serially}} <b>bought</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> white Mini, a gold Porsche, a red Ferrari, {{and a green}} Volkswagen Beetle, usually as surprises without consulting her first. Cynthia enjoyed the closeness of Pattie Boyd (George Harrison's wife) and Maureen Starkey (Ringo Starr's wife), as both lived nearby, often going on holiday together or shopping. She was often photographed at Beatles' movie premieres and special occasions, and sometimes with Lennon and Julian at home, which meant she had {{the role of a}} Beatle wife, as well as being a mother. The Lennons often went to a nightclub in central London until nearly dawn, after which she took Julian to school. [...] Kenwood became the place to visit for the other Beatles, various American musicians, and total strangers who Lennon had met the previous night in London nightclubs.|$|E
500|$|When Pound told Dorothy {{about the}} birth, she {{separated}} from him {{for much of}} that year and the next. In December 1925, she left on an extended trip to Egypt. She was pregnant by her return in March. In June she and Pound left Rapallo for Paris for the premiere of Le Testament de Villon, without mentioning the pregnancy to his friends or parents. In September, Hemingway drove Dorothy to the American Hospital of Paris {{for the birth of}} a son, Omar Pound. In a letter to his parents in October, Pound wrote, [...] "next generation (male) arrived. Both D & it appear to be doing well". Dorothy gave the baby son to her mother, Olivia, who raised him in London until he was old enough to go to boarding school. When Dorothy went to England each summer to see Omar, Pound would spend the time with Olga, whose father had <b>bought</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> house in Venice. The arrangement meant his children were raised very differently. Mary had a single pair of shoes, and books about Jesus and the saints, while Omar was raised in Kensington as an English gentleman by his sophisticated grandmother.|$|E

500|$|McCartney's {{first serious}} girlfriend in Liverpool was {{seventeen}} year old Dorothy [...] "Dot" [...] Rhone (a bank clerk or a cashier at a chemist's, according to varying accounts), {{whom he had}} met at The Casbah Club in 1959. McCartney picked out the clothes he liked Rhone to wear and told her which make up to use, also paying {{for her to have}} her blonde hair done in the style of Brigitte Bardot, whom both he and John Lennon idolised. He disliked Rhone seeing her friends, and stopped her from smoking, even though he did so himself. When McCartney first went to Hamburg with The Beatles he wrote regular letters to Rhone, and she accompanied Lennon's girlfriend, Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when the group played there again in 1962. According to Rhone, McCartney <b>bought</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> gold ring in Hamburg, a leather skirt, took her sightseeing, and was very attentive and caring. For the time Rhone was there, the couple lived in a bungalow by the Hamburg docks that belonged to Rosa, a former cleaner at the Indra club. McCartney admitted that he had other girlfriends in Hamburg when Rhone was in Liverpool, admitting that they were usually strippers, who knew a lot more about sex than Liverpool girls.|$|E
500|$|When a {{majority}} of the nation's newspapers expressed support of the strikers, Goldman and Berkman resolved to assassinate Frick, an action they expected would inspire the workers to revolt against the capitalist system. Berkman chose to carry out the assassination, and ordered Goldman to stay behind in order to explain his motives after he went to jail. He would {{be in charge of the}} deed; she of the word. Berkman tried and failed to make a bomb, then set off for Pittsburgh to buy a gun and a suit of decent clothes. Goldman, meanwhile, decided to help fund the scheme through prostitution. Remembering the character of Sonya in Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment (1866), she mused: [...] "She had become a prostitute in order to support her little brothers and sisters...Sensitive Sonya could sell her body; why not I?" [...] Once on the street, she caught the eye of a man who took her into a saloon, <b>bought</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> beer, gave her ten dollars, informed her she did not have [...] "the knack," [...] and told her to quit the business. She was [...] "too astounded for speech". She wrote to Helena, claiming illness, and asked her for fifteen dollars.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the largely}} {{positive}} view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 {{that he had}} at some point announced, [...] "The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes." [...] A journalist with the national African American weekly Jet, Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of Jailhouse Rock, Presley granted Robinson an interview, though {{he was no longer}} dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement or holding in any way to its racist view: [...] "I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that." [...] Also, Red Robinson stated, [...] "Take a look at the things that are only publicized now, of how he'd be driving down the street and see a destitute black woman with a little child. He went and <b>bought</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> Cadillac. Now if this guy hated blacks, he wouldn't even have gone near them". Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist. Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening, reported of Presley, [...] "He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest." [...] Dudley Brooks, an African-American composer and studio musician who worked with Presley during the 1950s and 1960s, also disputed allegations that Presley was a racist. Though the rumored remark was wholly discredited at the time, it was still being used against Presley decades later. The identification of Presley with racism—either personally or symbolically—was expressed most famously in the lyrics of the 1989 rap hit [...] "Fight the Power", by Public Enemy: [...] "Elvis was a hero to most / But he never meant shit to me / Straight-up racist that sucker was / Simple and plain".|$|E

[...] Studying in London during the 1960s, she was influenced by Pop Art, the Dada movement and surrealism.
