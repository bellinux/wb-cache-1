In 1680, Dutch naturalist Anton van Leeuwenhoek first microscopically observed yeast, but at the time did not consider them to be living organisms, but rather globular structures. Researchers were doubtful whether yeasts were algae or fungi, but in 1837 Theodor Schwann recognized them as fungi.|$|R

It {{can be reduced}} by desiccating or <b>baking</b> the <b>chamber,</b> and removing absorbent materials. Outgassed water can condense in the oil of rotary vane pumps and reduce their net speed drastically if gas ballasting is not used.

40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} {{to support}} {{improvements in the}} design and performance of ovens were performed on in situ wood-fired bakery ovens (WFBO) in order to evaluate the dependence {{of the quality of the}} bread produced on different process conditions that originate from the design of the oven, the temperature profile and the wood used in combustion. Temperatures were taken in different positions and the amount of inlet air entering the combustion chamber, along with the determination of quality parameters of the bread produced, are used. Analyses of the heat transferred to the bread during the baking process and the heat distribution in the oven were also performed. The results show that the quality of the bread shows a dependence on the distribution of heat and its intensity inside the <b>baking</b> <b>chamber</b> due to the temperature being non-uniform, even with steady temperature conditions in the oven. The heat intensity is affected by burning different wood species. The varying baking time used by the bakers is an additional factor that resulted in a nonuniform quality of the final product. Furthermore, the differences in the layers of sand that are under the oven base give rise to variations in conduction during the baking process and thus impact on the quality of the final product. Reducing the distance between the base and roof of the oven may increase the contact between the hot gases and the dough and result in a better distribution of heat in the baking oven...|$|E
40|$|Na lokalitetu Podšilo (općina Lopar, otok Rab) nalazi se djelomično očuvana rimska keramičarska peć. Zbog izravne ugroženosti njenih arhitektonskih dijelova, Institut za arheologiju u Zagrebu proveo je u proljeće 2009. godine zaštitna arheološka iskapanja. Prema rezultatima istraživanja, loparska peć pripada standardnom rimskom IIb tipu (Cuomo di Caprio). Ova peć pravokutnog tlocrta sastoji se iz dva osnovna dijela: ložišnoga kanala i komore za sušenje. Unutar komore proteže se dimni kanal koga nadsvođuje lučna konstrukcija, oslonjena na tri para nasuprotnih pilastara s lukovima. Uz otkriće keramičarske peći, na širem prostoru uz lokalitet Podšilo otkriven je cijeli niz pokretnih i nepokretnih nalaza koji ukazuju na vrlo intenzivan život ovog prostora u doba rimske antike. The Roman {{archaeological site}} of Podšilo {{is located in}} {{southern}} part of the Lopar Peninsula (Lopar Municipality, island of Rab, County of Primorje and Gorski Kotar). It is situated in a bay, encompassing the entire coastal area (between the bays of Dubec and Sahare) as well {{as a part of the}} immediate hinterland towards the south-west, all the way to the next antiquity site called “Beli Grad”. Since 2007 the Institute of Archaeology has conducted field survey of the territory of this site within the project “Northern Croatian Coastland within the Context of the Classical Antiquity Defense System”, led by Goranka Lipovac Vrkljan, PhD. At the Podšilo site a partly preserved Roman kiln was identified. Since its architectural elements are directly endangered, from 27 th April until 17 th May 2009 the Zagreb Institute of Archaeology conducted archaeological rescue excavations. The Roman kiln lays in the north-eastern peripheral part of the Podšilo Bay (opposite Goli Otok) and it seems that an elevated earthen hill was chosen for its position above the sea. But the fact that this hill is elevated compared to the surrounding landscape is a consequence of the disappearance of the surrounding soil due to erosion. Above the earthen cover its bow was visible, and it was not possible to identify whether it belonged to the bottom parts of the architecture or to the kiln’s roofing. In the last survey of this structure, conducted near the end of the year 2008, a devastation of the bow was stated, which in fact set off the kiln’s rescue excavation at the very beginning of the year 2009. After the preparatory stage of the site’s arrangement and documenting the existing status of the finds, the humus part SU 001 (only 0. 5 m thick) was removed. The first surface stratigraphic data enabled an immediate identification of the important spatial determinant for the location of the Lopar Roman kiln. The Romans decided to locate it on the hilly elevation (which was out of reach of sea), and the kiln’s entire structure – apart from the entrance part of the firing channel and its final coverings – was sunken into the ground. The method of burying the kiln is most evident from the height differences of sterile soil, and thus between the entrance to the kiln and its gable. At the entrance to the <b>baking</b> <b>chamber</b> the sterile soil ranged from ▼ 273 m above sea level to ▼ 3. 57 m above sea level. At the gable part of the kiln it is ▼ 5. 20 m above sea level. In addition to choosing a hilly elevation for burying the kiln, its constructors used another natural characteristic of the terrain: the presence of schist rocks, SU 013. Although schist is not as firm as other rock types, in this region it is an extraordinarily valuable construction element, used for kiln foundations and for reinforcement of its construction elements on a tremor flysch terrain. The kiln was buried in line with the ramp system: from the lowest point at the entrance into the praefurnium towards the highest point at the end of the kiln i. e. the gable wall. The Lopari Roman kiln was built as a standard Roman kiln type with a rectangular chamber, type II b (according to Cuomo di Caprio). The kiln consists of two basic parts: the firing channel – praefurnium (SU 021) and a combustion chamber (SU 087). The firing channel is 0. 70 m / 0. 80 m wide. The praefurnium floor (SU 048 and SU 079) is ▼ 3. 370 m above sea level. The firing channel walls were built of tiles and arch vaulted. No visible remains of the vault were preserved. The larger part of the channel was sunken (praefurnium SU 022 buried in sterile soil), with the exception of the entrance part. The preserved remains suggest that the firing channel length is 2. 20 m. The firing channel leads to the <b>baking</b> <b>chamber</b> and its smoke channel, SU 028. The <b>baking</b> <b>chamber</b> is of a rectangular shape 3. 00 m x 2. 90 m. Only the bottom layers of the chamber’s walls, SU 020, were preserved. Within the chamber there is a smoke channel SU 028, which had an arch vault with three opposite pairs of pilasters (diagonal compartments) followed by bows. As the fill of the kiln’s chamber was emptied, numerous contemporary materials were found pointing to a recent attempt at devastating this archaeological site. It was identified that the layers of almost the entire fill are upside-down. At the point where the firing channel turned to the chamber’s smoke channel, beneath the flooring of this preserved kiln, an extraordinarily thick layer of collapsed material, SU 080, was found, consisting of construction ceramic fragments. The collapsed layer is part of an earlier kiln that used to be at the same spot. Thus our assumption was confirmed that the remains of the Lopari kiln are not an isolated antiquity find at this site, but part of a pottery workshop belonging to a nearby Roman villa rustica. According to the first analyses, the Lopar kiln can be dated approximately in the first two centuries BC. Parallel with the archaeological digs, field survey was conducted of the wider area near the Podšilo site, and of the Lopar area. Thanks to information provided by the local population, numerous antiquity sites were identified, which testify to a very intensive life in the Lopar area during Roman antiquity...|$|E
40|$|Beam induced {{pressure}} rise was an intensity limit at CERN ISR {{during the early}} 1970 's. The beam gas ionization created pressure rise caused more gas ionization, resulting in pressure run-away at high beam intensity. Extensive <b>baking,</b> <b>chamber</b> treatment, and perhaps more importantly, a lot of added pumps helped raise the intensity threshold. Due to the large charge exchange cross sections low energy heavy ion machines such as the AGS Booster, CERN LEAR, and GSI SIS require very high vacuum to obtain good beam lifetime. Nevertheless, the beam loss/gas ionization created pressure rise increases with beam intensity, limiting the maximum attainable intensity. Pressure rise can also be created by electron stimulated desorption if an electron cloud has been formed by the beam. For most machines, electron cloud induced beam instability and/or beam emittance growth limit the beam intensity before pressure rise does. A special case is the RHIC, where electron clouds occur only in part of the warm sections (the total warm section is less than 1 / 4 of the ring). The beam intensity can be increased without inducing beam instability and emittance growth until the pressure rise impacts operation. The beam {{induced pressure}} rise is of concern, therefore, for several machines in operation. These include the AGS Booster, the GSI SIS, and the RHIC heavy ion and proton operations. The beam induced pressure rise {{is also an important}} issue for machines under construction or being planning. These include the LHC, SNS, LEIR, GSI upgrade, RHICII, eRHIC, and heavy ion fusion accelerators. The Workshop focused on three aspects relevant to the beam induced pressure rise: electron and ion desorption, vacuum chamber coating and treatment, and electron cloud effects. ELECTRON AND ION DESORPTION The main sources of beam induced pressure rise are electron stimulated gas desorption, ion desorption, and beam loss/halo scraping [2]. For electron multipacting and ISR type ion desorption, the incident angles are typically perpendicular. Given * Work performed {{under the auspices of the}} US Department of Energy...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} evaluation of an automated traveling baking and roasting oven is presented. The oven {{consists of a}} 300 mm x 300 mm traveling tray, a 4500 mm chain, and a 17 teeth sprocket to drive the chain. Heating is provided by two 30 -Watt heaters installed in a baking/roasting area of 0. 18 m 2. Two delay timers are installed to control {{the movement of the}} tray and the heating chamber while a thermostat regulates the heaters temperatures. A 70 g meat pie sample was baked at 200 oC, 250 oC, and 300 oC oven temperatures for 40 minutes. The meat pie sample was inspected every 5 minutes interval to determine the time for the bread roll to be fully baked. The result of the inspection tests carried out on the samples showed that it took the 15 minutes for a 70 g meat pie sample to be baked. It also revealed that the best baking temperature is 250 oC.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a novel atom chip trapping {{system that allows}} the placement and high-resolution imaging of ultracold atoms within microns from any < 100 um-thin, UHV-compatible material, while also allowing sample exchange with minimal experimental downtime. The sample is not connected to the atom chip, allowing rapid exchange without perturbing the atom chip or laser cooling apparatus. Exchange of the sample and retrapping of atoms has been performed within a week turnaround, limited only by <b>chamber</b> <b>baking.</b> Moreover, the decoupling of sample and atom chip provides the ability to independently tune the sample temperature and its position {{with respect to the}} trapped ultracold gas, which itself may remain in the focus of a high-resolution imaging system.

40|$|Combustion {{of biomass}} in {{small-scale}} furnaces {{is widely used}} in many countries and in different applications. The technology used is often “fixed grate” combustion in small batch furnaces. The efficiency of such furnaces is often low, which results in high environmental impact due to the poorly controlled combustion of the wood logs that are largely used as the heat source for baking bread in wood-fired bakery ovens. This work has been undertaken {{in order to develop}} an efficient and environmentally friendly bakery oven furnace fired by biomass. The work was performed in Mozambique, and a survey was used to evaluate the consumption of wood and the technology used in the process of bread baking in two selected townships. The data collected from the 104 bakeries consisted of the dimensions of the oven, the temperature profiles of the combustion chamber and baking oven, the baking time and the bread quality. The circulation of hot gases within a baking oven was used to describe and predict the behaviour of the heat exchange {{and the quality of the}} products produced. A bi-dimensional cold flow model and a CFD model were used to estimate the flow pattern inside the oven by varying the velocity of the air flow in order to simulate changes in the combustion chamber. Experimental measurements to support improvements in the design and performance of the oven were performed on in situ wood-fired bakery ovens in Mozambique in order to evaluate the dependence of the quality of bread produced on different process conditions that originated from design of oven, the temperature profile and the wood used in combustion. 3 D CFD model was also used to study the heat transfer process during the baking process to predict the causes of the differences in quality of the bread baked in same batch. The effects of the design of the oven were analysed concerning velocity, temperature distribution and heat transfer during the baking process. As much as 60 tonnes/day of green wood are consumed in the bread baking process in the areas investigated. Two types of bakery ovens are used most commonly: indirect and semi-direct. The specific consumption was found to be 0. 55 and 0. 90 kg of wood per kg of wheat flour baked for the indirect and semi-direct, respectively. The inlet velocity, the geometry and the mode of the feeding dough into the oven affect the flow pattern in the baking oven. The temperature becomes non-uniform, the velocity varies according to the inlet velocity and consequently the quality of the bread baked in WFBO is not uniform. The analyses of heat transfer from in situ bakery oven shows the dependence on distribution of heat and intensity inside the <b>baking</b> <b>chamber</b> due to the temperature being non-uniform, even with steady temperature conditions in the oven. The heat intensity is affected by burning different wood species. The differences in layers of sand under the oven base give rise to variations of the condition during the baking process. A mathematical model of the transient heat transfer in a wood-fired bakery oven shows a high accuracy with earlier experimental results. Furthermore, it describes the differences in the distribution of heat in the oven. Fifty per cent of hot gases cross the oven without releasing any heat. The variations in the heat distribution are the cause of the differences in the quality of the bread baked in this device. An example of optimisation using CFD model shows good approximation of the optimal geometry of the oven with reasonable heat distribution. However, the number of the samples must be increased to get the realistic heat distribution, which also requires substantial computing resourc...|$|E
