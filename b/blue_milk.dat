500|$|Lactarius indigo, {{commonly}} known as the indigo milk cap, the indigo (or blue) lactarius, or the <b>blue</b> <b>milk</b> mushroom, is a species of agaric fungus in the family Russulaceae. A widely distributed species, it grows naturally in eastern North America, East Asia, and Central America; it has also been reported in southern France. L.indigo grows on the ground in both deciduous and coniferous forests, where it forms mycorrhizal associations with a broad range of trees. The fruit body color ranges from dark blue in fresh specimens to pale blue-gray in older ones. The milk, or latex, that oozes when the mushroom tissue is cut or broken — a feature common to all members of the Lactarius genus — is also indigo blue, but slowly turns green upon exposure to air. The cap has a diameter of , and the stem is [...] tall and [...] thick. It is an edible mushroom, and is sold in rural markets in China, Guatemala, and Mexico.|$|E

Close to one plate a bunch of stocks and gilly flowers reposed on the dirty tablecloth, as though dropped and {{forgotten}} by the God of Love. Their faint perfume stole through the other odours.

On the previous night {{he had taken the}} manuscript out of a long-neglected chest, containing old shooting jackets, old Oxbridge scribbling-books, his old surplice, and battered cap and gown, and other memorials of youth, school, and home. He read in the volume in bed until he fell asleep, for the commencement of the tale was somewhat dull, and he had come home tired from a London evening party.|$|E

[...] And at last far below him he saw, as it were, a lake of heatless fire, the waters of the Central Sea, glowing and eddying in strange perturbation, [...] "like luminous <b>blue</b> <b>milk</b> that is just on the boil." ...|$|E

40|$|Six tests {{commonly}} {{used for the}} presumptive identification of group D streptococci were evaluated. Strains tested included 282 group D streptococci and 366 non-group D. Ratios of percentages of group D to non-group D strains which gave positive reactions for each test are as follows: bile-esculin, 100 : 2; salt tolerance, 88 : 24; heat tolerance, 100 : 80; SF broth, 86 : 1; KF broth, 99 : 40; and methylene <b>blue</b> <b>milk</b> reduction, 90 : 17. These data indicate that the bile-esculin test provided a reliable means of identifying group D streptococci and differentiating them from non-group D streptococci. Methodology for reading and interpreting positive reactions and time of incubation of the bile-esculin medium was defined. Evidence {{of the need for}} standardization of salt and heat-tolerance tests was obtained...|$|E
40|$|A {{methylene}} blue azide medium (MBA), developed by Schaedler, Dubos, and Costello to isolate enterococci from the gastrointestinal tract of animals, was evaluated. This {{was done by}} comparing the isolation of enterococci from feces and saliva on the medium. Fifty-two catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci from human feces isolated from MBA were classified as enterococci. All strains grew in S F, 6. 5 % NaCl, and streptomycin broths, and all fermented mannitol. The isolates were provisionally subdivided into Streptococcus faecalis and S. faecium groups. S. faecalis-like strains fermented glycerol and pyruvate aerobically and produced acid in Snyder's medium (initial pH, 4. 8). The S. faecium group fermented raffinose. Among all strains, several tests were variable. These included growth at 45 C, in 0. 1 % tellurite and in methylene <b>blue</b> <b>milk.</b> Three methods were employed to isolate and identify enterococci from the oral cavity. Direct streaking of MBA with saliva failed to produce any growth on the medium. Two other methods, {{with the use of}} various selective broths to promote the recovery of oral enterococci, failed to produce any bacteria capable of growing on MBA. The MBA-isolated fecal strains and oral viridans streptococci were generally indistinguishable on Mitis-Salivarius and K F agars. In experiments with fecal material, no gram-negative bacilli were found among the isolates selected. The MBA medium was judged as a high selectivity-low yield medium, and may provide a means of separating fecal and nonfecal enterococci...|$|E

40|$|The {{suitability}} {{of using the}} angular peak shape of the coherent backscattered light for estimating the light transport parameters of biological media has been investigated. <b>Milk</b> and methylene <b>blue</b> doped <b>milk</b> were used as tissue phantoms for the measurements carried out with a He-Ne laser (632. 8 nm).

Thus, anyone with sheep of the right breeds can make Roquefort cheese, if they are located in the part of France where that cheese is made, but nobody can make a <b>blue</b> sheep's <b>milk</b> cheese and call it Roquefort, even if they make {{it in such a way}} as to completely duplicate the process described in the definition of Roquefort.|$|R
