50|$|A blitter is a circuit, {{sometimes}} as a coprocessor or a logic block on a microprocessor, {{dedicated to the}} rapid movement and modification of data within a computer's memory. A blitter can copy large quantities of data from one memory area to another relatively quickly, and in parallel with the CPU, while freeing up the CPU's more complex capabilities for other operations. A typical use for a blitter is the movement of a bitmap, such as windows and fonts in a graphical user interface or images and backgrounds in a 2D computer game. The name comes from the bit blit operation of the 1973 Xerox Alto, which stands for bit-block transfer.

40|$|Abstract. Future {{semiconductors}} {{no longer}} guarantee permanent deterministic operation. They {{are expected to}} show probabilistic behavior due to lowered voltages and shrinking structures. Compared to radiation-induced errors, probabilistic systems face increased error frequencies leading to unexpected bit-flips. Approaches like probabilistic CMOS provide methods to control error distributions which reduce the error probability in more significant <b>bits.</b> However, instructions <b>handling</b> control flow or pointers still require determinism, requiring a classification to identify these instructions. We apply our transient error classification to probabilistic circuits using differing voltage distributions. Static analysis ensures that probabilistic effects only affect unreliable operations which accept {{a certain level of}} impreciseness, and that errors in probabilistic components will never propagate to critical operations. To evaluate, we analyze robustness and quality-of-service of an H. 264 video decoder. Using classification results, we map unreliable arithmetic operations onto probabilistic components of an ARM-based simulator, while remaining operations use deterministic components. ...|$|R

In operation, as the drilling bit rotate it penetrates the soil until the required depth is attained. A depth of 1 m was chosen {{for the purpose of}} this study and if more drilling pipes are provided, a depth of 4 - 6 m can be achieved.

The constructed drilling rig uses human power to operate and for this reason it can only be used for shallow borehole drilling, where the water table is close to the surface. A device of this nature can be manufactured in small workshop to aid water supply in small farms especially during dry season, mostly in the rural areas.
