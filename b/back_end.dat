5|$|The {{locomotive}} {{received its}} official naming ceremony in March 1945, {{although it was}} well over five {{years old at the}} time. Alderman Wiggins-Davies performed the ceremony at the <b>back</b> <b>end</b> of Birmingham New Street Station as the locomotive was too large to be accommodated within {{the main part of the}} station.|$|E
5|$|In the {{mandible}} (lower jaw), {{the mental}} foramen, an opening {{just before the}} first molar, opens sidewards, not upwards as in a few other oryzomyines. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, join at a point below the first molar and do not extend forward beyond that point. The capsular process, a raising of the bone {{of the back of}} the mandible that houses the <b>back</b> <b>end</b> of the incisor, is large.|$|E

40|$|Devices for {{generating}} streamwise vorticity in a boundary includes {{various forms of}} vortex generators. One form of a split-ramp vortex generator includes a first ramp element and a second ramp element with front <b>ends</b> and <b>back</b> <b>ends,</b> ramp surfaces extending between the front <b>ends</b> and the <b>back</b> <b>ends,</b> and vertical surfaces extending between the front <b>ends</b> and the <b>back</b> <b>ends</b> adjacent the ramp surfaces. A flow channel is between the first ramp element and the second ramp element. The <b>back</b> <b>ends</b> of the ramp elements have a height greater than a height of the front ends, and the front ends of the ramp elements have a width greater than a width of the <b>back</b> <b>ends...</b>|$|R
50|$|EMMS has {{multiple}} <b>back</b> <b>ends</b> {{to connect to}} external players so EMMS can support many different audio and video formats, while remaining clean and small itself. EMMS {{is divided into three}} parts, the player <b>back</b> <b>ends,</b> media sources (which can be a local file system or a network stream), and the core player. One of the player <b>back</b> <b>ends</b> connects to MPD. Other backends are available for mplayer and gstreamer. Additional players can be easily defined.|$|R
50|$|Fortunately, {{for this}} and several reasons {{outlined}} later, DNS servers that use such sophisticated database <b>back</b> <b>ends</b> in general rarely use zone transfer as their database replication mechanism in the first place, and usually instead employ the vastly superior distributed database replication mechanisms that the <b>back</b> <b>ends</b> themselves provide.|$|R
5|$|The United States Veterans Hospital at Northport Long Island New York {{maintains}} a memorial plaque that names {{all of the}} Medal of Honor recipients who have lived in Long Island. Lt. Murphy's name was placed in honor on this memorial shortly after {{he was awarded the}} Medal of Honor. Others honored include President Theodore Roosevelt, General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., and Murphy’s fellow Eastern Long Island hero Garfield Langhorn. The Memorial, which is at the <b>back</b> <b>end</b> of the hospital lobby, is in close proximity to where his mother works in the hospital.|$|E
5|$|The interorbital {{region is}} 4.14mm {{long and the}} {{zygomatic}} plate is 2.38mm. The diastema (gap) between the incisors and molars is 6.39mm long. The incisive foramina are 5.25mm long and 1.77mm broad. The palatal bridge (the portion of the palate between the incisive foramina and the mesopterygoid fossa behind the <b>back</b> <b>end</b> of the palate) is 4.29mm long and 2.75mm broad at the first molars. The upper molar row is 4.13mm long and M1 is 1.19mm broad. These measurements make J.anoblepas the largest known species of Juliomys.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) is robust. The two masseteric ridges, which anchor {{some of the}} chewing muscles, {{are joined}} together as a single crest {{for a portion of}} their length and extend forward to a point below the first molar. The capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone at the <b>back</b> <b>end</b> of the lower incisor, is well developed.|$|E

5000|$|Furthermore, the {{paradigm}} of database replication for which the serial number check (and indeed zone transfer itself) is designed, which involves a single central DNS server holding the master version of the database with all other DNS servers merely holding copies, simply does not match that of many modern DNS server packages. Modern DNS server packages with sophisticated database <b>back</b> <b>ends</b> such as SQL servers and Active Directory allow administrators to make updates to the database in multiple places (such systems employ Multi-master replication), with the database <b>back</b> <b>end's</b> own replication mechanism handling the replication to all other servers. This paradigm simply does not match that of a single, central, monotonically increasing number to record changes, and thus is incompatible with zone transfer to a large extent. Modern DNS server packages with sophisticated database <b>back</b> <b>ends</b> often will create a [...] "shim" [...] serial number, simulating {{the existence of a}} single central place where updates are made, but this is at best imperfect.|$|R
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) {{is short}} and deep. The mental foramen, an opening {{at the front of}} the mandible, just before the first molar, opens to the side. The capsular process of the lower incisor, a raising of the mandibular bone at the <b>back</b> <b>end</b> of the incisor, is well developed. The two masseteric ridges, to which some of the chewing muscles are attached, are entirely separate, joining only at their front edges, which are located below the first molar.|$|E
5|$|In the {{mandible}} (lower jaw), {{the upper}} and lower masseteric ridges come close together below the first molars, but do not fuse. The <b>back</b> <b>end</b> of the lower incisor root is in a capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone behind the molars. The upper incisors have yellowish enamel and are opisthodont, with the cutting edge inclined backwards. The molars are relatively small and are brachydont (low-crowned) and bunodont (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests). They {{are similar to those of}} the marsh rice rat in structural details. The upper and lower first molars have small accessory roots, as in many other oryzomyines, and the second and third lower molar each have two roots only.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} part, Lewis Hamilton quickly set a fast lap time, the quickest {{of the weekend}} up to that point, about half a second ahead of his {{teammate}} Rosberg. Meanwhile, Daniel Ricciardo set his fastest lap on the harder supersoft compound tyre, meaning {{that he would be}} able to start the race on them, should it have stayed dry. On the <b>back</b> <b>end,</b> Williams struggled for pace and both Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa missed out on Q3 by qualifying 11th and 14th respectively. Also eliminated were Esteban Gutiérrez, Jenson Button, Romain Grosjean and Magnussen.|$|E

5|$|In the skull, {{it has a}} {{significantly}} longer rostrum (the front part of the skull) and diastema (the gap between the incisors and the molars). Furthermore, it has shorter molar rows in both {{the upper and lower}} jaws. The <b>back</b> <b>end</b> of the incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate), which is located in front of the first molars, is rounded in eastern voalavo, but angular in northern voalavo. The sutures of the maxillary and palatine bones (the line where the two bones, part of the skull, join) are straight and parallel to each other, the toothrows, and the midline of the skull in eastern voalavo. Northern voalavo, in contrast, are more curved. Statistical analysis of measurements of the skull and teeth clearly separates the two species of Voalavo.|$|E
5|$|In third {{practice}} on Saturday morning, Hamilton narrowly beat Rosberg to the fastest time, lapping just 0.068 seconds faster than his teammate. All drivers used the super-soft tyre compound {{to set their}} fastest lap times, with the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen third and fourth ahead of the Williams pair of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas. Vettel {{had spent most of}} the session testing his car with a heavier fuel load in preparation for the race that would see him start with a five-place grid penalty for a change of the gearbox. He completed the highest number of laps with 28, ahead of Daniel Ricciardo, who was 11th fastest. At the <b>back</b> <b>end,</b> the Sauber drivers of Ericsson and Nasr were slowest, behind both Manor cars.|$|E
5|$|Like Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, {{and other}} styracosternans, Eolambia has {{cervical}} vertebrae {{which are very}} opisthocoelous, meaning that their front ends are strongly convex while their back ends are strongly concave. Unusually, {{the front end of}} the third cervical is set slightly higher than the <b>back</b> <b>end,</b> which is not seen in any other cervical vertebrae. Vertebrae from further back in the neck have a greater angle between the elongate articular processes known as the postzygapophyses, and also more elongate transverse processes. On the transverse processes, there are further articular processes – the rounded parapophyses and rod-like diapophyses – are located. In the rearmost cervicals, there is also a deep depression separating the postzygapophyses, and the neural spines have steeply-angled front margins, which has the effect of creating prominent spike-like projections.|$|E

5|$|Viewed {{from the}} top, the parietal {{increases}} in width at the back; {{the increase is}} small in K. langenbergensis, such that the bone is overall rectangular, but the difference is larger in K. guimarotae. The back of the bone bears a small notch in K. langenbergensis and a general concavity in K. guimarotae that slightly exposes the underlying supraoccipital. The postorbital bears two branches that join with a gentle curve, separated by an angle of 130° in K. langenbergensis. The supratemporal fenestra is roughly square in K. guimarotae but has a thinner <b>back</b> <b>end</b> in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the maximum distance between the supratemporal fenestrae is {{about a third of}} the total width of the top of the skull. The trapezoidal infratemporal fenestra is 1.5 times as long as it is wide in K. langenbergensis.|$|E

5|$|All {{isotopes}} between 242Cm and 248Cm, {{as well as}} 250Cm, {{undergo a}} self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction and thus in principle {{can act as a}} nuclear fuel in a reactor. As in most transuranic elements, the nuclear fission cross section is especially high for the odd-mass curium isotopes 243Cm, 245Cm and 247Cm. These can be used in thermal-neutron reactors, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for fast breeder reactors since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn-up increases. The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which is to be used in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the neutron activation of 248Cm will create californium. This is strong neutron emitter, and would pollute the <b>back</b> <b>end</b> of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel. Hence, if the minor actinides are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor, the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present.|$|E

40|$|Contemporary Web sites {{typically}} {{consist of}} front-end Web servers, application servers, and back-end information {{systems such as}} database servers. There has been limited research on how to provide overload control and service differentiation for the back-end systems. In this paper we propose an architecture called tiered service (TS) for these purposes. In TS, there are several heterogeneous back-end systems to serve the Web applications. The Web applications communicate with a routing intermediary to intelligently route the queries to the appropriate back-end servers based on various policies such as client profiles and server load. In our system the <b>back</b> <b>ends</b> may store different qualities of data; lower quality data typically requires less overhead to serve. The main contributions of this paper include (i) a tiered content replication scheme that replicates tiered qualities of data on heterogeneous <b>back</b> <b>ends</b> with different capacity to satisfy clients with diverse requirements for latency and quality of data (ii) an application-transparent query routing architecture that automatically routes the queries to the appropriate <b>back</b> <b>ends.</b> The architecture was implemented in our test bed, and its performance was benchmarked. The experimental results demonstrate that TS offers significant performance improvement...|$|R
5000|$|Like {{various other}} DNS servers, Microsoft's DNS server {{supports}} different database <b>back</b> <b>ends.</b> Microsoft's DNS server supports two such <b>back</b> <b>ends.</b> DNS {{data can be}} stored either in master files (also known as zone files) or in the Active Directory database itself. In the latter case, since Active Directory (rather than the DNS server) handles the actual replication of the database across multiple machines, the database can be modified on any server ("multiple-master replication"), and the addition or removal of a zone will be immediately propagated to all other DNS servers within the appropriate Active Directory [...] "replication scope". (Contrast this with BIND, where when such changes are made, the list of zones, in the /etc/named.conf file, has to be explicitly updated on each individual server.) ...|$|R
5|$|At 6.8 to 9.2 (7.7) mm, {{males are}} only about half as long as females. Their maximum width is 34 to 42 (37) μm. The length of the {{esophagus}} is 2.3 to 3.0 (2.6) mm, of which the muscular pharynx makes up 260 to 315 (273) μm, and is lined by 35 to 42 (37) stichocytes. The back region of the worm is 4.5 to 6.2 (5.1) mm long. The back, or rectal, opening of the digestive tube is located {{near the end of}} the worm, and the length of the cloaca is 530 to 576 (550) μm. Near the <b>back</b> <b>end,</b> there are two alae (ridges) at the sides (laterally), which are 40 to 55 (46) μm long; these are located at 10 to 15 μm from another, small ala at the tip. In A.putorii, the lateral alae are much longer and reach the ala at the tip. The spicule, a spikelike structure that functions in reproduction, is curved at the tip and hardened and has a length of 380 to 426 (406) μm. It is smaller than that of the similar A.tamiasstriati from North American chipmunks and larger than that of A.murissylvatici from various North American and European small rodents, but about as long as that of A.putorii, which however lacks the curved tip.|$|E
5|$|Compared to E.nitidus and E.macconnelli, {{the skull}} is {{relatively}} small and slender. It has broad and short incisive foramina (perforations of the palate between the incisors and the molars) and lacks sphenopalatine vacuities which perforate the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind {{the end of the}} palate. The animal is similar to other members of the genus in the pattern of the arteries of the head. The alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone which separates two foramina (openings) in the skull (the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium) is rarely present; its presence is more frequent in E.nitidus. The capsular process, a raising of the bone of the mandible (lower jaw) behind the third molar, houses the <b>back</b> <b>end</b> of the lower incisor in most Euryoryzomys, but is absent in E.emmonsae and E.macconnelli. Traits of the teeth {{are similar to those of}} E.nitidus and other Euryoryzomys.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011, it was {{announced}} that Mertens had signed for fellow Eredivisie club PSV as a replacement for the departing Balázs Dzsudzsák in a dual transfer with Utrecht teammate Kevin Strootman for a combined fee of €13million. He scored on his competitive debut for the club on 7 August 2011, netting PSV's only goal in a 3–1 loss to AZ. Later that month, on 28 August, Mertens scored his first hat-trick for PSV in a 6–1 drubbing of Excelsior. Mertens' strong start to season culminated with him netting four goals in a 7–1 rout of Roda JC on 24 September 2011, meaning he had scored 11 goals in his first 7 appearances for PSV. Towards the <b>back</b> <b>end</b> of the campaign, Mertens lost a number of teeth during a collision with Heracles goalkeeper Remko Pasveer, although he managed to score during the incident. It was revealed on social media platform Twitter that Pasveer had found one of Mertens' teeth lodged in his head three weeks after the players had collided. Mertens ultimately ended the season having scored 21 goals in 33 matches, the fourth highest in the Eredivisie. He also scored three goals in four KNVB Cup matches, including a header in the final at De Kuip, Rotterdam, leading PSV to a 3–0 win over Heracles.|$|E
