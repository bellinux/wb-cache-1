This paper presents the process of designing and the result from the automotive refrigeration system simulation that have been integrated into the test rig. To perform the test on automotive refrigeration simulator the location for the temperature measurement selected and thermocouples were installed. The locations of the temperature probes are at the inlet and outlet of compressor, condenser outlet and the inlet of the evaporator. The gas pressure was measured at low and high pressure sides located at evaporator outlet and receiver-drier respectively.

40|$|During {{last few}} decades {{research}} on Automotive Air Conditioning System (AACS) reached a milestone in terms of comfort, safety and economy. However investigation on system performance due to AACS’s variable operating conditions is limited. The performance of any AACS mostly depends on compressor speed, <b>blower</b> <b>speed,</b> refrigerant charge level and ambient condition. However, the combined effect of these parameters {{on the performance of}} AACS could be non-intuitive. Reduction in compressor speed and <b>blower</b> <b>speed</b> reduces the cooling capacity. Again, higher <b>blower</b> <b>speed</b> induces large volume of fresh air inside the cabin, which requires more compression work to maintain the same comfort level. Further the best performance of the system is achieved at an optimum charge level which is not independent of the other operating conditions. Therefore, it is essential to assess the performance of AACS for a wide combination of operating variables so that the range of optimum operating zone can be identified. With this purpose, an off board test bench has been developed for evaluating the performance of an automotive air conditioning system. The facility consists of the mechanical hardware used in an automobile along with a large number of additional sensors and a standalone control system that mimics the operations in a car. The experiments were carried out with varying compressor and <b>blower</b> <b>speed</b> along with a variable refrigerant charge for a given ambient condition. Total sixty set of experiments were conducted at 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 g of refrigerant charge level. In each charge level the speed of the compressor was fixed at 1000, 1300, 1600 and 1900 rpm by using a variable frequency drive. Again in each compressor speed, the <b>blower</b> <b>speed</b> of the evaporator was selected at three different set points. The cooling capacity, compression work and COP of the system are reported in this paper over this wide operating range. It is observed that with the increase in compressor speed, cooling capacity and compression work increases along with a decrease in the COP of the system. The results indicate that the AACS could operate over a wide range of charge levels, 15 % below to 15 % above the design value without any significant impact on its performance. Beyond this range, the performance of the system was found to be strongly dependent upon the charge level. The degree of superheat at the evaporator outlet and degree of subcooling at the condenser outlet were shown to be significantly dependent on the level of refrigerant charge. Though the system performance depends on the speed of both the compressor and the blower, the effect of the latter on the refrigeration cycle is only marginal. The optimum operating condition with compressor and <b>blower</b> <b>speed</b> along with refrigerant charge level has also been identified...|$|E
40|$|Residential-scale ale systems control indoor {{temperature}} but not humidity. The {{advent of}} variable-speed compressors and blowers make such control possible. This paper uses a detailed simulation model {{to explore the}} tradeoff between energy efficiency and comfort, as measured by indoor humidity. Simultaneous solution of heat and mass transfer equations for the building, along with simulation of the air conditioner, {{makes it possible to}} calculate indoor humidity as a function of outdoor dew point and infiltration rate. The results presented in Chapter 4 show how indoor humidity can be lowered by decreasing the evaporator air flow rate, because the fin temperatures are reduced and remove more condensate. In a moderate climate condition (75 ??P indoor temperature, 80 ??P outdoor temperature and 700 P outdoor dew-point temperature), indoor relative humidity can be reduced from 61 to 57 % by reducing the <b>blower</b> <b>speed</b> from 500 cfm/ton to 200 cfm/ton. In addition to the extra comfort, system power input, averaged over the on/off cycles, decreases for most climate conditions with this <b>blower</b> <b>speed</b> reduction. In a moderate climate (75 /S 0 / 70), average power drops from 0. S 3 to 0. 77 kW, a 7 % decrease in power usage in addition to the increase in comfort. Reducing the compressor speed, and therefore refrigerant mass flow rate, increases EER by utilizing the heat exchangers for longer runtimes at lower Ll T's. However the refrigerant-side LlT becomes a larger fraction of the total LlT, so the effect of reducing <b>blower</b> <b>speed</b> is diluted. Overall, the system runs more efficiently but for a longer time, removing the same sensible load and latent load, and preventing shortcycling that would increase indoor humidity. In the baseline climate (75 /S 0 / 70) halving the compressor speed and reducing the <b>blower</b> <b>speed</b> from 500 to 200 cfm/ton has a negligible effect in indoor humidity, and reduces average power 33 % from 0.

Paradoxically, {{it turned out that}} DC locomotives were somewhat more efficient overall than AC locomotives. [...] "Auxiliary Electric Motors" [...] are mainly used for air cooling electric machinery such as traction motors. Electric locomotives concentrate high power electric machinery in a relatively small space and thus require a lot of cooling. [...] Per the table below, a sizeable amount of energy (11-17%) is used for this, but when operating at nominal power only 2-4% is used. [...] The fact that the cooling motors run at full speed (and power) all the time makes their power consumption constant, so when the locomotive motors are operating at low power (far below the nominal regime) the percent of this power used for cooling blowers becomes much higher. The result is that under actual operating conditions, the percent energy used for cooling is a few times higher than [...] "nominal". Per the table below, AC locomotives used about 50% more energy for this purpose since in addition to cooling the motors, the blowers must cool the transformer, rectifiers and the smoothing reactor (inductors), which are mostly absent on DC locomotives. [...] The 3-phase AC power for these blower motors is supplied from a rotary phase converter which converts single phase (from the catenary via the main transformer) to 3-phase (and this also takes energy).

Combustion temperatures highest in the experiment using a speed of 3 m / s, in the 7 th minute, with the temperature 700. 66 ℃, to the speed of 3. 5 m / s in the 7 th minute of 718. 33 ℃, and at a speed of 4 m / s on a minute - 4 amounted to 644. 16 ℃. From a comparison between the temperature of combustion speed of 3 m / s, 3. 5 m / s and 4 m / s indicates the lowest speed will produce effective flame longer, while using the air velocity will be obtained most large combustion temperature. This happens as long as the stoichiometric limits of course...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient speed governor for the blower motor {{used in the}} air conditioning of electric vehicles (EV). Performance optimization of blowers offers tremendous potential for energy saving and hence the running cost. Pulse width modulation (PWM) technique {{is one of the}} most economical and widely used techniques in the motor control applications. SG 3525 device is used to generate the required PWM signals for the regulation of the <b>blower</b> motor <b>speed.</b> The PWM signal with 0 - 100 % duty ratio control governs the semiconductor switches such as MOSFETs in controlling the supply voltage to the motor. The proposed control scheme governs the speed by varying the reference voltage to the SG 3525 and also protects the motor from high current as the scheme monitors the current flow through the motor indirectly via gate control signal of the semiconductor switches...|$|R
40|$|In the paper, the {{development}} of high-speed industrial turbo blowers with foil air bearings {{is presented as a}} first successful commercialization in the world. Their target market is various from wastewater treatment to cement factory processes which require compressed air ranging between 0. 6 and 0. 8 bar gauge. Employing the state-of-the-art technology of the high-speed BLDC motors, the bump-type foil air bearings and the high-efficient turbo impellers/diffusers, so much compact, efficient and silent blower machines of a single stage are now available in the market, aiming to replace the existing inefficient, bulky and noisy ones, such as roots blowers. The first production lines are established for 75 and 150 hp class <b>blowers.</b> Rotational <b>speeds</b> up to 40, 000 rpm are realized directly from the high-speed BLDC motors without any gear boxes, and no lubrication oil is required. A brief introduction of design, manufacture and test results is presented for mechanical, electrical and aerodynamic performance...|$|R
50|$|VAV hoods, {{the newest}} generations of {{laboratory}} fume hoods, vary {{the volume of}} room air exhausted while maintaining the face velocity at a set level. Different VAV hoods change the exhaust volume using different methods, such as a damper or valve in the exhaust duct that opens and closes based on sash position, or a <b>blower</b> that changes <b>speed</b> to meet air-volume demands. Most VAV hoods integrate a modified bypass-block system that ensures adequate airflow at all sash positions. VAV hoods are connected electronically to the laboratory building’s HVAC, so hood exhaust and room supply are balanced. In addition, VAV hoods feature monitors and/or alarms that warn the operator of unsafe hood-airflow conditions.|$|R
