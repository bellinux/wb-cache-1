25|$|Rod {{sticking}} {{has been}} attributed to misalignment, corrosion product build-up, <b>bearing</b> <b>wear,</b> clutch wear, and drive mechanism seal wear. Many of the failure modes that caused a stuck rod during tests (like bearing and clutch wear) would only apply to a movement performed by the control rod drive mechanism. Since the No. 9 rod is centrally located, its alignment may have been better than Nos. 1, 3, 5, and 7 which were more prone to sticking. After the accident, logbooks and former plant operators were consulted to determine if there had been any rods stuck during the reassembly operation that Byrnes was performing. One person had performed this about 300 times, and another 250 times; neither had ever felt a control rod stick when being manually raised during this procedure. Furthermore, no one had ever reported a stuck rod during manual reconnection.|$|E

50|$|Integral {{bearings}} are not {{as common}} because bushings are easier to accommodate and can be replaced if necessary. Depending on the material, an integral bearing may be less expensive but it cannot be replaced.

Integral bearings were very common in 19th-century machinery, but became progressively less common as interchangeable manufacture became popular.|$|R

50|$|One {{important}} {{part is the}} seamer setup. This process is usually performed by an experienced technician. Amongst the parts that need setup are seamer rolls and chucks which have to be set in their exact position (using a feeler gauge or a clearance gauge).

Locomotives always {{travelled}} with their boilers facing [...] "down" [...] the line, i.e. towards Lynton (down as it was away from London by rail, although geologically, Lynton was higher, and geographically nearer to London). The turntable was used to turn rolling stock periodically to even-out <b>bearing</b> <b>wear.</b> After closure, the turntable was installed at the Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch Railway in Kent, but is now owned by the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway Trust and in storage for eventual restoration and reuse on the new L&B.|$|E

The isolastic frame made it much smoother than the Atlas. It used rubber bushings to isolate the engine and swing arm from the frame, forks, and rider. However, as the steel-shims incorporated in the Isolastic <b>bearings</b> <b>wore,</b> often from rusting, the bike became prone to poor handling - fishtailing in high-speed turns.|$|R

Because they do not contain polyethylene, these <b>bearings</b> <b>wear</b> {{at a much lower}} rate, provided they are manufactured according to specifications, and are implanted well. These allow the patients to return to higher levels of activity after the operation without the fear of early wear. Furthermore, because the devices have the same diameter as the patients' own, they are less prone to dislocation.|$|R

5000|$|Machining or {{remanufacturing}} crankshafts are {{precision machined}} to exact tolerances with no odd size crankshaft bearings or journals.

50|$|The pistons {{are made}} of light metal alloy and have three {{compression}} rings {{as well as one}} oil ring. They are connected to the crankshaft with I-shape connecting rods made of heat treatable steel. The bearings of the connecting rods {{are made of}} a lead bronze alloy and are fixed with a pin. Each connecting rod has a small oil pipe for the lubrication of it′s bearings. For weight reduction, the connecting rod pins are hollow-drilled. The crankshaft with hardened pins is supported in five bearings and is equipped with couter-weights to reduce crankshaft <b>bearing</b> <b>wear.</b> The covers of the crankshaft bearings are mounted with two pin screws each. The flywheel is flanged onto the crankshaft. On the opposite site of the crankshaft, it holds a friction- and vibration damper.|$|E
5000|$|... "Dyna Drive" [...] - A pedal {{system with}} no pedal axle {{and with the}} {{bearings}} located {{in the part of}} the pedal which screws into the crank. This required an oversized hole in the crank 25mm (1" [...] diameter) to accept the Dyna Drive pedals. The theory behind this was to allow the foot to be lower than the pedal axle for better biomechanics. This system was relatively short lived, one reason being that the pedal <b>bearings</b> <b>wore</b> out quickly. However, they were used by Alexi Grewal (USA) in his gold medal winning ride in the 1984 Olympic cycling road race in Los Angeles.|$|R

50|$|Many {{people think}} that {{long-term}} use may induce additional wear {{due to lack of}} oil lubrication. For the crankshaft bearing half shells and the big end bearings this can translate into frequent high-speed rotary movement before a hydrodynamic film is established. During this phase of boundary lubrication, metal-to-metal contact can occur between the crankshaft surface and the bearing’s sliding surface. This was not an issue while the number of engine restarts totaled at what was generally understood to be a normal magnitude. However, in a vehicle with start-stop system this effect can necessitate new technological solutions to avoid premature <b>bearing</b> <b>wear,</b> depending on the driving cycle. Consequently, future engines for start-stop applications need to be designed for 250,000 to 300,000 starts. Traditional bearing shells with aluminum or copper lining show severe wear after only 100,000 cycles. In a start stop system the short stop times keep the engine and oil warm, retaining lubrication. Some implementations do not use a starter motor, eliminating concerns of starter motor wear. Mazda i-stop used in their Mazda3/Axela line (in Europe and JDM) uses combustion to restart their engine by sensing the position of the piston in the cylinder. They claim quieter and quicker engine restart within 0.35 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Powerplant {{failure of}} the type that afflicted the LOT {{aircraft}} was extremely rare because <b>bearing</b> <b>wear</b> is generally identified by vibration tests during maintenance. At the time, however, LOT did not have equipment to test or fault-diagnose engines of the size used in the Il-62. Unfortunately this meant that any potential problem might not be identified between overhauls. There were other known instances of engine failure (e. g. YR-IRD & CU-T1283) but these {{did not result in}} loss of control. The LOT accidents involving different engine types (but same engine position) was a fatal crash-rate 30 times higher than the Il-62 average (2.8% vs 0.092%). At least one other LOT Soloviev D-30-equipped aircraft (Tu-154) also suffered a similar engine failure (non-fatal) around this time. After 1987, LOT introduced turbine vibration-detecting equipment and shortened the time between inspections. It also adopted the dual flight control system used on some other Il-62s and deleted the auxiliary engine-pod fuel tanks. These planes were subsequently sold to Air Ukraine in 1991/1992 which operated them until the airline closed in 2000. In 2010, 30 years after the loss of Flight 007, an investigation of previously unreleased IPN archives at Instytut Pamięci Narodowej revealed that during the industrial unrest of the 1980s LOT had been instructed by the PRL authorities to effect operational cost savings by over-exploitation of service life of its jet engines (see LOT Flight 007, Causes of disaster).|$|E
50|$|In all gliding <b>{{bearings}}</b> <b>wear</b> is {{an issue}} of concern, as well as lubrication. Conventional gliding yaw bearings incorporate gliding elements manufactured out of polymer plastics such as POM or PA. To reduce friction, wear, and avoid stick-slip effects (often present in such high friction slow moving systems), lubrication is often introduced. This solution generally solves the gliding issues, but introduces more components to the systems and increases the general complication (e.g., difficult maintenance procedures for removal of used lubricant). Some wind turbine manufacturers now use self lubricating gliding elements instead of a central lubrication system. These gliding elements are manufactured from low friction materials or composites (e.t.g Teflon) that allow reliable operation of dry (non-lubricated) gliding yaw systems.|$|R
50|$|Rolling-element {{bearings}} {{are widely}} used in the industries today, and hence maintenance of these bearings becomes an important task for the maintenance professionals. The rolling-element <b>bearings</b> <b>wear</b> out easily due to metal-to-metal contact, which creates faults in the outer race, inner race and ball. It {{is also the most}} vulnerable component of a machine because it is often under high load and high running speed conditions. Regular diagnostics of rolling-element bearing faults is critical for industrial safety and operations of the machines along with reducing the maintenance costs or avoiding shutdown time. Among the outer race, inner race and ball, the outer race tends to be more vulnerable to faults and defects.|$|R
2500|$|Camshaft {{bearings}} {{are similar}} to crankshaft main bearings, being pressure-fed with oil.

40|$|Most {{high speed}} {{cryogenic}} turbopumps for liquid propulsion rocket engines currently use ball or roller contact bearings for rotor support. The operating speeds, loads, clearances, and environments of these pumps combine to make <b>bearing</b> <b>wear</b> a limiting factor on turbopump life. An {{example is the}} high pressure oxygen turbopump (HPOTP) used in the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). Although the HPOTP design life is 27, 000 seconds at 30, 000 rpms, or approximately 50 missions, bearings must currently be replaced after 2 missions. One solution to the <b>bearing</b> <b>wear</b> problem in the HPOTP, {{as well as in}} future turbopump designs, is the utilization of fluid film bearings in lieu of continuous contact bearings. Hydrostatic, hydrodynamic, and damping seal bearings are all replacement candidates for contact bearings in rocket engine high speed turbomachinery. These three types of fluid film bearings have different operating characteristics, but they share a common set of mechanical design opportunities and difficulties. Results of research to define some of the mechanical design issues are given. Problems considered include transient strat/stop rub, non-operational rotor support, <b>bearing</b> <b>wear</b> inspection and measurement, and bearing fluid supply route. Emphasis is given to the HPOTP preburner pump (PBP) bearing, but the results are pertinent to high-speed cryogenic turbomachinery in general...|$|E
