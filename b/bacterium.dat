40|$|This paper {{presents}} the species of <b>bacteria</b> {{used in this}} study as well as the effect of the <b>bacteria</b> on compressive strength of bioconcrete. Bioconcrete is not only more environmentally friendly but it is easy to procure. The objective of this research is to identify the ureolytic <b>bacteria</b> and sulphate reduction <b>bacteria</b> that have been isolated and further use the <b>bacteria</b> in concrete to determine the effect of <b>bacteria</b> on compressive strength. Identification of <b>bacteria</b> is conducted through Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and DNA sequencing. The DNA of the <b>bacteria</b> was run through BLAST algorithm to determine the bacterial species. The <b>bacteria</b> were added into the concrete mix as a partial replacement of water. 3 % of water is replaced by ureolytic <b>bacteria</b> and 5 % of water is replaced by sulphate reduction <b>bacteria.</b> After running BLAST algorithm the <b>bacteria</b> were identified as Enterococcus faecalis (ureolytic <b>bacteria)</b> and Bacillus sp (sulphate reduction <b>bacteria).</b> The result of the compressive strength for control is 36. 0 Mpa. Partial replacement of 3 % water by ureolytic <b>bacteria</b> has strength of 38. 2 Mpa while partial replacement of 5 % of water by sulphate reduction <b>bacteria</b> has strength of 42. 5 Mpa. The significant increase of compressive strength with the addition of <b>bacteria</b> shows that <b>bacteria</b> {{play a significant role in}} the improvement of compressive strength...|$|R
5|$|Beauveria bassiana (Hyphomycetes) is a {{pathogenic}} fungus that infects a {{wide range}} of insect species, including the Colorado potato beetle.

5|$|For {{many years}} exobiologists have {{proposed}} {{the existence of}} a shadow biosphere, a postulated microbial biosphere of Earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life. One of the proposals was the existence of lifeforms that use arsenic instead of phosphorus in DNA. A report in 2010 of the possibility in the <b>bacterium</b> GFAJ-1, was announced, though the research was disputed, and evidence suggests the <b>bacterium</b> actively prevents the incorporation of arsenic into the DNA backbone and other biomolecules.|$|E
40|$|Analyses of pond {{water and}} mud samples show that nitrifying <b>bacteria</b> (including ammonifying <b>bacteria,</b> nitrite <b>bacteria,</b> {{nitrobacteria}} and denitrifying <b>bacteria)</b> are in general closely correlated with various physico-chemical factors, ammonifying <b>bacteria</b> are mainly correlated with dissolved oxygen; denitrifying <b>bacteria</b> are inversely correlated with phosphorus; nitrite <b>bacteria</b> are closely correlated with nitrites, nitrobacteria are inversely correlated with ammoniac nitrogen. The nitrifying <b>bacteria</b> are more closely correlated with heterotrophic <b>bacteria.</b> Nitrobacteria are inversely correlated with anaerobic heterotrophic <b>bacteria.</b> The correlation is quite weak between all the nitrite <b>bacteria</b> {{which indicates that}} the nitrite <b>bacteria</b> have a controlling and regulating function in water quality {{and there is no}} interdependence as each plays a role of its own. The paper also discusses how the superficial soil (pond mud down to 3. 5 cm deep) and different layers of the mud affect the biomass of <b>bacteria.</b> The study shows that the top superficial layer (down to 1. 5 cm deep) is the major area for decomposing and converting organic matter...|$|R

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{promoting}} effect of starch on cellulose digestion by mixed rumen <b>bacteria</b> in a cellulose-urea medium.

At the bottom of the column will be green sulfur photosynthetic anaerobic <b>bacteria,</b> the layer above will be purple which is sulphur anaerobic <b>bacteria,</b> followed by another column of purple anaerobic non-sulfur <b>bacteria</b> and at the top will be a layer of Cyanobacteria which is sulphur oxidising <b>bacteria.</b> This top layer of aerobic <b>bacteria,</b> produces CO2 which feeds back into the column creating further reaction.|$|R
40|$|Fluorescence in situ hybridizations {{were used}} to {{identify}} and determine the abundance of nitrifying <b>bacteria</b> and Anammox <b>bacteria</b> (recycling <b>bacteria)</b> in freshly settled sludge of biological nutrient removal (BNR) secondary clarifiers.

Escherichia Colt and other coliform <b>bacteria</b> were counted using the membrane filter technique to describe the distribution of the coliform <b>bacteria.</b> Phylogenetic analysis was applied to investigate the diversity of the coliform <b>bacteria.</b> The results suggested that the quantities of coliform <b>bacteria</b> varied greatly between five sampling sites with the highest value at site YT 4 and the lowest value at site YT 2. Highest concentrations of E. coli and other coliform <b>bacteria</b> were also observed at YT 4, while the lowest value was detected at sites YT 3 and YT 2, respectively. Various coliform <b>bacteria</b> were classified by phylogenetic analysis, including Citrobacter, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Raoultella. Components of coliform <b>bacteria</b> affiliated into these four genera were various in all sampling sites.
