Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) is the newest thermal infrared sensor for the Landsat project, providing two adjacent thermal bands, which has a great benefit for the LST inversion.

Establishing a link between these two trends, however, is challenging due to complex interactions between aerosols, clouds, and radiation.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{methodology}} to generate 30 -m resolution land surface albedo using Landsat surface reflectance and anisotropy information from concurrent MODIS 500 -m observations. Albedo information at fine spatial resolution is particularly useful for quantifying climate impacts associated with land use change and ecosystem disturbance. The derived white-sky and black-sky spectral albedos maybe {{used to estimate}} actual spectral albedos by {{taking into account the}} proportion of direct and diffuse solar radiation arriving at the ground. A further spectral-to-broadband conversion based on extensive radiative transfer simulations is applied to produce the broadband albedos at visible, near infrared, and shortwave regimes. The accuracy of this approach has been evaluated using 270 Landsat scenes covering six field stations supported by the SURFace RADiation <b>Budget</b> <b>Network</b> (SURFRAD) and Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains (ARM/SGP) network. Comparison with field measurements shows that Landsat 30 -m snow-free shortwave albedos from all seasons generally achieve an absolute accuracy of +/- 0. 02 - 0. 05 for these validation sites during available clear days in 2003 - 2005,with a root mean square error less than 0. 03 and a bias less than 0. 02. This level of accuracy has been regarded as sufficient for driving global and regional climate models. The Landsat-based retrievals have also been compared to the operational 16 -day MODIS albedo produced every 8 -days from MODIS on Terra and Aqua (MCD 43 A).

The MERSI data are suitable for mapping terrestrial, atmospheric and oceanographic variables at continental to global scales. This study presents a direct-estimation method to retrieve surface shortwave net radiation (SSNR) data from MERSI top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and cloud mask products. This study is the first attempt to use the MERSI to retrieve SSNR data. Several critical issues concerning remote sensing of SSNR were investigated, including scale effects in validating SSNR data, impacts of the MERSI calibration update on the estimation of SSNR and the dependency of the retrieval accuracy of SSNR data on view geometry. We also incorporated data from twin MODIS sensors to assess how time and the number of satellite overpasses affect the retrieval of SSNR data. Validation against one-year data over seven Surface Radiation <b>Budget</b> <b>Network</b> (SURFRAD) stations showed that the presented algorithm estimated daily SSNR at the original resolution of the MERSI with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 41. 9 W/m 2 and a bias of − 1. 6 W/m 2. Aggregated to a spatial resolution of 161 km, the RMSE of MERSI retrievals can be reduced by approximately 10 W/m 2. Combined with MODIS data, the RMSE of daily SSNR estimation can be further reduced to 22. 2 W/m 2.

40|$|Surface solar {{irradiance}} (SSI) {{is required in}} a wide range of scientific researches and practical applications. Many parameterization schemes are developed to estimate it using routinely measured meteorological variables, since SSI is directly measured at a very limited number of stations. Even so, meteorological stations are still sparse, especially in remote areas. Remote sensing can be used to map spatiotemporally continuous SSI. Considering the huge amount of satellite data, coarse-resolution SSI has been estimated for reducing the computational burden when the estimation is based on a complex radiative transfer model. On the other hand, many empirical relationships are used to enhance the retrieval efficiency, but the accuracy cannot be guaranteed out of regions where they are locally calibrated. In this study, an efficient physically based parameterization is proposed to balance computational efficiency and retrieval accuracy for SSI estimation. In this parameterization, the transmittances for gases, aerosols, and clouds are all handled in full band form and the multiple reflections between the atmosphere and surface are explicitly taken into account. The newly proposed parameterization is applied to estimate SSI with both Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) atmospheric and land products as inputs. These retrievals are validated against in situ measurements at the Surface Radiation <b>Budget</b> <b>Network</b> and at the North China Plain on an instantaneous basis, and moreover, they are validated and compared with Global Energy and Water Exchanges-Surface Radiation Budget and International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project-flux data SSI estimates at radiation stations of China Meteorological Administration on a daily mean basis.

40|$|The {{major part}} of 2007 was devoted to the {{integration}} of the data acquisition infrastructure of the GAW Swiss Atmospheric Radiation Monitoring program (CHARM) in the main MeteoSwiss ground measurement network SwissMetNet (SMN). This required the interruption of the radiation monitoring while the infrastructure was renewed. Furthermore, the transition was more difficult than anticipated, and the interruption lasted longer than foreseen. CHARM radiation data monitoring at the Jungfraujoch was resumed end of October 2007. As a consequence, the data availability is below 10 % for radiation parameters at the Jungfraujoch in 2007. In order to mitigate the impact of this transition, an independent and self-sufficient measuring system for short-wave global and long-wave downward radiation (used as travelling reference by the Alpine Surface <b>Budget</b> <b>Network)</b> has been installed to supply data at least for these two parameters during the interruption. Currently, quality control and analysis is on-going on the data from the new system to ensure at least the same level of quality as in the previous setting. Because SMN will include all standard surface meteorological stations as well as other stations such as the CHARM stations with common data acquisition software, hardware, and a dedicated data transmission network, resources can be focused on insuring the reliability of this network, and CHARM will profit from it. In addition, this common network will improve the compatibility of CHARM data with other meteorological data, and the maintenance of CHARM will be simplified. Finally, this will insure that CHARM data acquisition hardware and software are updated with state-of-the-art technology.

However, currently, fine resolution estimates of net-radiation are not available and consequently {{it is challenging to}} develop multi-year estimates of evapotranspiration at scales that can capture land surface heterogeneity and are relevant for policy and decision-making. We developed and evaluated a global net-radiation product at 5 km and 8 -day resolution by combining mutually consistent atmosphere and land data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board Terra. Comparison with net-radiation measurements from 154 globally distributed sites (414 site-years) from the FLUXNET and Surface Radiation <b>budget</b> <b>network</b> (SURFRAD) showed that the net-radiation product agreed well with measurements across seasons and climate types in the extratropics (Wilmott’s index ranged from 0. 74 for boreal to 0. 63 for Mediterranean sites). Mean absolute deviation between the MODIS and measured net-radiation ranged from 38. 0 ± 1. 8 W∙m− 2 in boreal to 72. 0 ± 4. 1 W∙m− 2 in the tropical climates. The mean bias was small and constituted only 11 %, 0. 7 %, 8. 4 %, 4. 2 %, 13. 3 %, and 5. 4 % of the mean absolute error in daytime net-radiation in boreal, Mediterranean, temperate-continental, temperate, semi-arid, and tropical climate, respectively. To assess the accuracy of the broader spatiotemporal patterns, we upscaled error-quantified MODIS net-radiation and compared it with the net-radiation estimates from the coarse spatial (1 ° × 1 °) but high temporal resolution gridded net-radiation product from the Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES). Our estimates agreed closely with the net-radiation estimates from the CERES. Difference between the two was less than 10 W·m− 2 in 94 % of the total land area.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the first available satellite-based global albedo product at 1 -km resolution is essential for its application in climate studies. We evaluate {{the accuracy of the}} Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo product using available field measurements at Surface Radiation <b>Budget</b> <b>Network</b> (SURFRAD) and Cloud and Radiation Testbed–Southern Great Plains (CART/SGP) stations and examine the consistency between the MODIS surface albedos and the Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) top-of-the-atmosphere albedos as well as historical global albedos from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) observations. A comparison with the field measurements shows that the MODIS surface albedo generally meets an absolute accuracy requirement of 0. 02 for our study sites during April–September 2001, with the root mean square errors less than 0. 018. Larger differences appear in the winter season probably due to the increased heterogeneity of surface reflectivity in the presence of snow. To examine the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the validation of the MODIS albedos using fine resolution field measurements, we derive an intermediate albedo product from four Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images at 30 -m spatial resolution as a surrogate for the distributed field measurements. The surface albedo is relatively homogeneous over the study stations in growing seasons, and therefore the validation during April–September is supported. A case study over three SURFRAD stations reveals that the MODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function model is able to capture the solar zenith angle dependence of surface albedo as shown by the field measurements. We also find that the MODIS surface shortwave albedo is consistent with the contemporary and collocated CERES top-of atmosphere albedos derived directly from broadband observations. The MODIS albedo is also well correlated with historical surface albedos derived from AVHRR and ERBE observations, and a high bias of 0. 016 and a low bias of 0. 034 compared to those of the latter albedos are reasonable considering the differences in instruments and retrieval algorithms as well as environmental changes...|$|E
40|$|The surface {{radiation}} budget (SRB) {{is important in}} addressing a variety of scientific and application issues related to climate trends, hydrological and biogeophysical modeling, and agriculture. The three longwave components of SRB are surface downwelling, upwelling, and net longwave radiation (LWDN, LWUP, and LWNT). Existing surface longwave {{radiation budget}} (SLRB) datasets have coarse spatial resolution and their accuracy needs to be greatly improved. This study develops new hybrid methods for estimating instantaneous clear-sky high spatial resolution land LWDN and LWUP from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, 1 km) and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES, 2 - 10 km) data. The hybrid methods combine extensive radiation transfer (physical) and statistical analysis (statistical) and share the same general framework. LWNT is derived from LWDN and LWUP. This study is the first effort to estimate SLRB using MODIS 1 km data. The new hybrid methods are unique {{in at least two}} other aspects. First, the radiation transfer simulation accounted for land surface emissivity effect. Second, the surface pressure effect in LWDN was considered explicitly by incorporating surface elevation in the statistical models. Nonlinear models were developed using the simulated databases to estimate LWDN from MODIS TOA radiance and surface elevation. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were developed to estimate LWUP from MODIS TOA radiance. The LWDN and LWUP models can explain more than 93. 6 % and 99. 6 % of variations in the simulated databases, respectively. Preliminary study indicates that similar hybrid methods can be developed to estimate LWDN and LWUP from the current GOES- 12 Sounder data and the future GOES-R data. The new hybrid methods and alternative methods were evaluated using two years of ground measurements at six validation sites from the Surface Radiation <b>Budget</b> <b>Network</b> (SURFRAD). Validation results indicate the hybrid methods outperform alternative methods. The mean RMSEs of MODIS-derived LWDN, LWUP, and LWNT using the hybrid methods are 16. 88, 15. 23, and 17. 30 W/m 2. The RMSEs of GOES- 12 Sounder-derived LWDN and LWUP are smaller than 23. 70 W/m 2.

40|$|Long-term {{data sets}} of all-sky and clear-sky {{downwelling}} shortwave (SW) radiation, cloud cover fraction, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) were analyzed together with surface concentrations from several networks (e. g., Surface Radiation <b>Budget</b> <b>Network</b> (SURFRAD), Clean Air Status and Trend Network (CASTNET), Interagency Monitoring of Protection Visual Environments (IMPROVE) and Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM)) in the United States (US). Seven states with varying climatology {{were selected to}} better understand the effects of aerosols and clouds on SW radiation. This analysis aims to assess the effects of reductions in anthropogenic aerosol burden resulting from substantial reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and nitrogen oxides (NO x) over the past 16 yr across the US, based on trends in SW radiation. The SO 2 and NO x emission data show decreasing trends from 1995 to 2010, which indirectly validates the effects of the Clean Air Act (CAA) in the US. Meanwhile, the total column AOD and surface total PM 2. 5 observations also show decreasing trends in the eastern US but slightly increasing trends in the western US. Moreover, measured surface concentrations of several other pollutants (i. e., SO 2, SO 4 and NO x) have similar behavior to AOD and total PM 2. 5. Analysis of the observed data shows strong increasing trends in all-sky downwelling SW radiation with decreasing trends in cloud cover. However, since observations of both all-sky direct and diffuse SW radiation show increasing trends, there may be other factors contributing to the radiation trends in addition to the decreasing trends in overall cloud cover. To investigate the role of direct radiative effects of aerosols, clear-sky downwelling radiation is analyzed so that cloud effects are eliminated. However, similar increasing trends in clear-sky total and diffuse SW radiation are observed. While significantly decreasing trends in AOD and surface PM 2. 5 concentrations along with increasing SW radiation (both all-sky and clear-sky) in the eastern US during 1995 – 2010 imply the occurrence of direct aerosol mediated "brightening", the increasing trends of both all-sky and clear-sky diffuse SW radiation contradicts this conclusion since diffuse radiation would be expected to decrease as aerosols direct effects decrease and cloud cover decreases. After investigating several confounding factors, the increasing trend in clear-sky diffuse SW may be due to more high-level cirrus from increasing air traffic over the US. The clear-sky radiation observations in the western US also show indications of "brightening" even though the AOD, PM 2. 5 and surface concentration do not vary drastically. This outcome was not unexpected because the CAA controls were mainly aimed at reducing air pollutant emissions in the eastern US and air pollutant levels in the western US were much lower at the onset. This suggests other factors affect the "brightening" especially in the western US...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a statistical regression method {{to estimate the}} instantaneous Downwelling Surface Longwave Radiation (DSLR) for cloud-free skies using only the satellite-based radiances measured at the Top Of the Atmosphere (TOA), and subsequently combines the DSLR with the MODIS land surface temperature/emissivity products (MOD 11 _L 2) to estimate the instantaneous Net Surface Longwave Radiation (NSLR). The proposed method relates the DSLR directly to the TOA radiances in the MODIS Thermal InfraRed (TIR) channels provided that the terrain altitude and the satellite Viewing Zenith Angle (VZA) are known. The simulation analysis shows that the instantaneous DSLR could be estimated by the proposed method with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 12. 4  W/m 2 for VZA = 0 and terrain altitude z = 0  km. Similar results are obtained for the other VZAs and altitudes. Considering the MODIS instrumental errors of 0. 25  K for the TOA brightness temperatures in channels 28, 33 and 34, and of 0. 05  K for channels 29 and 31, and of 0. 35  K for channel 36, the overall retrieval accuracy {{in terms of the}} RMSE is decreased to 13. 1  W/m 2 for the instantaneous DSLR. Moreover, a comparison of MODIS derived DSLR and NSLR are done with the field measurements made at six sites of the Surface Radiation <b>Budget</b> <b>Network</b> (SURFRAD) in the United States for days with cloud-free conditions at the moment of MODIS overpass in 2006. The results show that the bias, RMSE and the square of the correlation coefficient (R 2) between the MODIS derived DSLR with the proposed method and the field measured DSLR are 20. 3  W/m 2, 30. 1  W/m 2 and 0. 91 respectively, and bias = 11. 7  W/m 2, RMSE = 26. 1  W/m 2 and R 2 = 0. 94 for NSLR. In addition, the scheme proposed by Bisht et al. [Bisht, G., Venturini, V., Islam, S., & Jiang, L. (2005). Estimation of the net radiation using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data for clear-sky days. Remote Sensing of Environment, 97, 52 - 67], which requires the MODIS atmospheric profile product (MOD 07) and also the MODIS land surface temperature/emissivity products (MOD 11 _L 2) as inputs, is used to estimate the instantaneous DSLR and NSLR for comparison with the field measurements as well as the MODIS derived DSLR and NSLR using our proposed method. The results of the comparisons show that, at least for our cases, our proposed method for estimating DSLR from the MODIS radiances at the TOA and the resultant NSLR gives results comparable to those estimated with Bisht et al. 's scheme [Bisht, G., Venturini, V., Islam, S., & Jiang, L. (2005). Estimation of the net radiation using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data for clear-sky days.

40|$|Abstract. We {{show how}} binary {{decision}} diagrams (BDDs) {{can be used}} to solve and obtain postoptimality analysis for linear and nonlinear integer programming problems with binary or general integer variables. The constraint set corresponds to a unique reduced BDD that represents all feasible or near-optimal solutions, and in which optimal solutions correspond to certain shortest paths. The BDD can be queried in real time for in-depth postoptimality reasoning. The approach is equally effective for linear and nonlinear problems. There are currently no other methods for obtaining such an analysis, short of repeatedly re-solving the problem. We illustrate the analysis on capital <b>budgeting</b> and <b>network</b> reliability problems. ...|$|R
