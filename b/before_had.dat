5|$|In 2005, {{the body}} of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in her apartment in Hamburg, Germany. The body was bloated and discolored, and upon initial examination, {{it was found that the}} head of the fetus had made its appearance in the vaginal opening. At autopsy, medical examiners found that both the head and shoulders of the fetus had emerged, and concluded that it was a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress. The woman, who had given birth twice <b>before,</b> <b>had</b> died of a heroin overdose. The case was unusual and serendipitous, as few medical practitioners have been able to observe and document the progress of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E

5|$|In the post-classic era, a {{significant}} trend in noir crossovers has involved science fiction. In Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville (1965), Lemmy Caution {{is the name}} of the old-school private eye in the city of tomorrow. The Groundstar Conspiracy (1972) centers on another implacable investigator and an amnesiac named Welles. Soylent Green (1973), the first major American example, portrays a dystopian, near-future world via a self-evidently noir detection plot; starring Charlton Heston (the lead in Touch of Evil), it also features classic noir standbys Joseph Cotten, Edward G. Robinson, and Whit Bissell. The film was directed by Richard Fleischer, who two decades <b>before</b> <b>had</b> directed several strong B noirs, including Armored Car Robbery (1950) and The Narrow Margin (1952).|$|E
5|$|Maria Theresa was as {{conservative}} {{in matters of}} state as in those of religion, but implemented significant reforms to strengthen Austria's military and bureaucratic efficiency. She employed Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz, who modernised the empire by creating a standing army of 108,000men, paid for with 14million gulden extracted from each crown-land. The central government {{was responsible for the}} army, although Haugwitz instituted taxation of the nobility, who never <b>before</b> <b>had</b> to pay taxes. Maria Theresa oversaw the unification of the Austrian and Bohemian chancellories in May 1749.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{regression}} also {{resulted in}} the loss of epeiric seas, such as the Western Interior Seaway of North America. The loss of these seas greatly altered habitats, removing coastal plains that ten million years <b>before</b> <b>had</b> been host to diverse communities such as are found in rocks of the Dinosaur Park Formation. Another consequence was an expansion of freshwater environments, since continental runoff now had longer distances to travel before reaching oceans. While this change was favorable to freshwater vertebrates, those that prefer marine environments, such as sharks, suffered.|$|E

5|$|The ships' armor {{protection}} was improved over earlier designs. The {{belt and}} barbette armor was increased by an inch {{compared to an}} earlier version of the twelve-gun battleship. A new protection scheme for the funnels was devised, after the Russian experience at the Battle of Tsushima three years <b>before</b> <b>had</b> highlighted the risk of a destroyed exhaust system. The designers also emphasized the need for improved underwater protection. As a result, the Wyomings design incorporated a torpedo bulkhead, the first time the feature was included on an American battleship design. Congress approved two new battleships, BB-32 and BB-33, on 3 March 1909. Design 502 later proved to be the basis for the subsequent class of battleships, the s.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of {{the exact}} {{location}} of the blockading squadron, Decatur set a course to avoid them and seek a safe port, but approximately two hours later the squadron's sails were spotted on the horizon. President changed course to outrun them, but the damage she suffered the night <b>before</b> <b>had</b> significantly reduced her speed. Attempting to gain speed, Decatur ordered expendable cargo thrown overboard; by late afternoon of 15January, HMS Endymion under Captain Henry Hope came alongside and proceeded to fire broadsides. Decatur planned to bring President in close to Endymion, whereby Presidents crew could board and capture the opposing ship and sail her to New York. (President would be scuttled to prevent her capture).|$|E
5|$|Montevideo, a royalist stronghold {{during the}} Argentine War of Independence, was under siege by José Gervasio Artigas. Those {{in the city}} raided {{population}} centres along the nearby rivers for supplies. José de San Martín, who shortly <b>before</b> <b>had</b> arrived in Buenos Aires and formed the regiment, followed the royalist ships to San Lorenzo. The area around San Lorenzo formed a large empty plain, so the regiment hid inside the San Carlos convent during the night and San Martín studied the battlefield and the enemy ships from the tower. The battle started at dawn, when the grenadiers made a surprise pincer movement to trap the enemy forces. One column was led by San Martín, and the other by Justo Germán Bermúdez. San Martín fell from his horse, and was nearly killed, but Juan Bautista Cabral and Juan Bautista Baigorria intervened and saved him. The royalists were defeated, but continued to raid villages for some more time afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Danes Island in {{the summer}} of 1897, the {{expedition}} found that the balloon hangar built the year <b>before</b> <b>had</b> weathered the winter storms well. The winds were more favorable, too. Andrée had strengthened his leadership by replacing the older and critical Ekholm, an authority in his field, with the 27-year-old enthusiast Knut Frænkel. On July 11, in a steady wind from the south-west, the top of the plank hangar was dismantled, the three explorers climbed into the already heavy basket, and Andrée dictated one last-minute telegram to King Oscar and another to the paper Aftonbladet, holder of press rights to the expedition. The large support team cut away the last ropes holding the balloon and it rose slowly. Moving out low over the water, it was pulled so far down by the friction of the several-hundred-meter-long drag ropes against the ground as to dip the basket into the water. The friction also twisted the ropes round, detaching them from their screw holds. These holds were a new safety feature that Andrée had reluctantly been persuaded to add, whereby ropes that got caught on the ground could be more easily dropped.|$|E
5|$|The Saturday morning {{practice}} session was 17minutes {{shorter than the}} scheduled 60minutes, due to Kovalainen's Renault having a suspected engine failure. The failure caused oil to be split on the track, this failure persisted during the race weekend. This resulted in a red flag period, from 10:33am until 10:50am local time. Hamilton led the practice with the fastest lap; with Räikkönen, Alonso and Massa posting the second, third and fourth fastest laps respectively. Sato finished the session with the fifth fastest lap in the Super Aguri car, outpacing the Honda works team {{for the second time}} during the race weekend. Toyota continued a disappointing race weekend, with the 14th and 16th fastest laps. Their suspension problems from the day <b>before</b> <b>had</b> not been resolved, and the two drivers were given instructions to avoid the kerbs at turn 8 to minimise further damage to the suspension. Red Bull came back with both of the two repaired cars entering the top ten.|$|E

The war broke out in June 1866, as Italy, which had allied with Prussia, sought to take {{advantage}} of the Austro-Prussian War to seize Austrian-controlled Venice. After initially remaining in port, the Italian fleet under Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano launched an attack on the island of Lissa in mid-July; the Austrian fleet under Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff sortied to mount a counterattack, which resulted in the Battle of Lissa on 20 July. Formidable, which had been badly damaged during an engagement with Austrian coastal fortifications on Lissa the day <b>before,</b> <b>had</b> withdrawn by the time Tegetthoff arrived and took no part in the battle. Terribile also played no role in the action, as she had been stationed too far to the south in preparation for another attack on the island, and she arrived on the scene of the battle only after the two fleets had disengaged.|$|E
