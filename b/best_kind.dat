Through his interaction (at first satirizing it before ultimately accepting it as essential to his development) with Stein's Three Lives (1909) and [...] (1914), Anderson found the plain, unambiguous voice that became a staple of his prose. As indicated by the correspondence the two writers developed after the publication of Winesburg, Ohio, variations on the repetition found in Stein's writing in addition to their mutual appreciation for the sentence as a basic unit of prose were also likely features of her writing that Anderson noticed and drew upon in writing his Winesburg, Ohio. Literary critic Irving Howe summarized the pair's connection aptly when he wrote, [...] "Stein was the <b>best</b> <b>kind</b> of influence: she did not bend Anderson to her style, she liberated him for his own." ...|$|E

Even prior to the airing of the episode, James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly suggested that the actor's voice would be perfect for an animated television series.

Carp noted that [...] "Cranston's work is even more impressive {{when you consider that}} he not only plays the hero and villain but manages to be funny as both." [...] In addressing [...] "Part II", Carp concluded that [...] "as early as the stunning end of the world sequence, the actor plants the hint of suppressed craziness in Spaceman Drake and it was soon obvious that the just crew would not only be manning a mission to help him combat the mutineers but probably get wrapped up in this nut's dream to terra form Mars."

[...] Cleave questioned: [...] "If a government can't even successfully proof-read such a fundamental document, how seriously can we take its asylum procedure?" [...] In writing The Other Hand, Cleave hoped to [...] "humanise" [...] the issue for readers. Despite discussions of political violence and British Colonialism within the novel, Sarah L. Courteau, editor of the Wilson Quarterly commented: [...] "You're almost entirely unaware of its politics because the book doesn't deal in abstractions but in human beings." [...] For this reason, she deemed The Other Hand [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>kind</b> of political novel".

[...] A month later Darwin emphasised that he was bewildered by the theological aspects and [...] "had no intention to write atheistically, but could not see, as plainly as others do, & as I shd wish to do, evidence of design & beneficence on all sides of us.
