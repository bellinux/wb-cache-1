Attalea vitrivir was recognised as a distinct species by Michael Balick and coauthors; Glassman and Govaerts and Dransfield concurred, but Henderson considered it part of A.speciosa. Glassman also described a fourth member of this group, A.brejinhoensis, and it is accepted by Govaerts and Dransfield.|$|E
5|$|At about 75 Jupiter radii {{from the}} planet, the {{interaction}} of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath—a region <b>between</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from the solar wind.|$|E

40|$|Strategic {{alignment}} or the fit <b>between</b> {{information technology}} (<b>IT)</b> <b>and</b> business strategy remains a key topic of concern among managers worldwide. Change has always being considered the foremost challenge affecting strategic alignment.

Reviewing the literature showed {{that there is a}} positive relationship <b>between</b> <b>IT</b> infrastructure flexibility <b>and</b> strategic alignment with strategic information systems planning (SISP) serving as a moderator of this relationship. Additionally, according to literature on exporting area and logical arguments we proposed that export performance can moderators the link <b>between</b> <b>IT</b> flexibility <b>and</b> strategic alignment. Also, studies results emphasize the need for organizations to use SISP to consistently monitor the relationship <b>between</b> <b>IT</b> flexibility <b>and</b> alignment. Doing so during periods of increased change in dynamic and uncertain environments reduces the risk of being ensnared by rigidity traps that could transform IT into an inhibitor rather than an enable...|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{information}} technology (IT) have enabled firms to increasingly rely on open innovation. Although researchers and practitioners are interested in this phenomenon, {{there is a lack}} of theoretically driven research on how IT impacts organizational open innovation performance. Drawing on the strategic <b>IT</b> alignment perspective <b>and</b> related literature, we proposed a model to explain the performance of organizational open innovation; i. e., the alignment <b>between</b> <b>IT</b> strategies <b>and</b> the openness of open innovation strategies results in different outcomes for open innovation. Through the analysis of data from 225 firms in China, we found that the alignment <b>between</b> <b>IT</b> flexibility <b>and</b> breadth enhances innovation radicalness and innovation volume, whereas the alignment <b>between</b> <b>IT</b> integration <b>and</b> depth positively affects innovation volume only. Innovation volume and radicalness were found to enhance organizational performance in terms of sales growth.

40|$|Significant {{amounts of}} {{resources}} {{have been and}} continue to be invested in information technology (IT). Much of this investment is {{made on the basis of}} assumption that returns will occur. Prior studies have shown that IT investment increases firm’s performances and operational efficiency. Although, IT investment by Malaysian public listed companies (PLCs) increases annually, but the investment is still insufficient. Additionally, empirical studies and scientific research on <b>IT</b> <b>and</b> firm’s performance in Malaysian PLCs are still lacking. The objective of this research work is to examine the relationship <b>between</b> <b>IT</b> investment <b>and</b> firm’s financial performance in Malaysian PLCs. Firm performance was measured by revenue, return on investment (ROI) and return on assets (ROA). A panel data analysis was applied to the data observed from 2009 to 2012. Data for three years on <b>IT</b> investment <b>and</b> firm’s performance was collected from a sample of 90 firms via annual reports. The result of regressing return on investment against IT investment indicates that there is a relationship <b>between</b> <b>IT</b> investment <b>and</b> return on investment. However, the result of regressing return on assets and revenue indicates that there is no relationship <b>between</b> <b>IT</b> investment <b>and</b> return on assets, <b>IT</b> investment <b>and</b> revenue respectively. The analysis provides useful implications for managers to better understand the relationship <b>between</b> <b>IT</b> investment <b>and</b> firms’ performance so that they can make wiser decisions to maximize the business value of their investments...|$|R

Based on empirical data collected from 74 US construction firms, the analyses provide evidence that IT has {{a positive impact on}} overall firm performance, schedule performance, and cost performance.
