5|$|Akshaya Tritya is {{considered}} holy and supremely auspicious by Jains. It {{is believed that}} Rishabhanatha took his first ahara (alms) after becoming an ascetic on this day. Rishabhanatha, Jains <b>believe,</b> <b>was</b> the first monk of the present half cycle of time (avasarpini). Therefore, people {{did not know how}} to offer food (ahara) to monks. King Shreyansa of Hastinapur offered sugarcane juice (ikshu-rasa) to Rishabhanatha. Jains attach great importance to this day as it was only after one year that Rishabhanatha was offered food. The day is celebrated in the Jain tradition on the third day of the bright fortnight of the month Vaishaka (usually April).|$|E
5|$|In 2007, McCann {{launched}} a multi-platform global advertising campaign titled Believe, that included sixminutes of live-action sequences called Landfall, {{to promote the}} latest game in the Halo series, Halo 3. Landfall was directed by Neill Blomkamp who also agreed to direct a full length Halo film, but it was cancelled due to funding disagreements. Believe proved a critical and financial hit. Over £84 million of sales were made {{on the first day}} of release alone, the highest-grossing opening sale of an entertainment product at the time. Believe received dozens of awards from the advertising community, including eight Clio Awards, Best in Show at the ANDY Awards, and two Grand Prix (for Film and Integrated campaigns) at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, the most prestigious awards ceremony in the advertising industry. According to the Gunn Report, <b>Believe</b> <b>was</b> the second-most-awarded integrated advertising campaign of 2008, behind Earth Hour for the World Wide Fund for Nature.|$|E

25|$|Additional tests {{conducted}} {{at both the}} University of Edinburgh and the Roslin Institute, in which bee venom and acetic acid was injected into the lips of rainbow trout, resulted in fish rubbing their lips along the sides and floors of their tanks, which the researchers <b>believe</b> <b>was</b> an effort to relieve themselves of pain.|$|E
25|$|The elites of Tiwanaku lived inside {{four walls}} that were {{surrounded}} by a moat. This moat, some <b>believe,</b> <b>was</b> to create {{the image of a}} sacred island. Inside the walls were many images devoted to human origin, which only the elites would see. Commoners may have entered this structure only for ceremonial purposes, since it was home to the holiest of shrines.|$|E

25|$|Ahmadiyya claims its {{objective}} to be {{the peaceful}} propagation of Islam with special emphasis on spreading the true message of Islam by the pen. Ahmadis point out that as per prophecy, who they <b>believe</b> <b>was</b> the promised messiah, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, rendered the concept of violent jihad unnecessary in modern times. They believe that the answer of hate should be given by love.|$|E
25|$|Jerry Palus, a Chicago southsider, {{reported}} that in 1939 he met a person whom he came to <b>believe</b> <b>was</b> Resurrection Mary at the Liberty Grove and Hall at 47th and Mozart (and not the Oh Henry/Willowbrook Ballroom). They danced and even kissed and {{she asked him to}} drive her home along Archer Avenue, exiting the car and disappearing in front of Resurrection Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|The Table Talk of Martin Luther {{contains}} {{the story of}} a twelve-year-old boy who some <b>believe</b> <b>was</b> severely autistic. According to Luther's notetaker Mathesius, Luther thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated. In 2003, an autistic boy in Wisconsin suffocated during an exorcism by an Evangelical minister in which he was wrapped in sheets.|$|E
50|$|The {{plot of the}} {{original}} Escape Velocity involves disputes between the Confederation government and a Rebellion against it. As noted earlier, the player may choose sides (or not) based on who they <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> right, who they <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> stronger, who they <b>believe</b> it <b>is</b> more profitable to support, or any other criteria. The player begins with a shuttlecraft resembling those from Star Trek.|$|R

25|$|Ray and Bill dragged {{dedication}} around Australia for 103 days last summer...they {{dragged it}} from Brisbane to Perth and {{back across the}} Nullabor to the eastern capitals {{as if it was}} their last dollar. Unfortunately they directed most of it towards avoidance of defeat during a seven-act performance which most of us were naive enough to <b>believe</b> <b>was</b> staged primarily for public entertainment and which was financed by the public.|$|E
25|$|In {{another study}} {{examining}} the Forer effect, students took the MMPI personality assessment and researchers evaluated their responses. The researchers wrote accurate {{evaluations of the}} students' personalities but gave the students an accurate assessment and a fake assessment using vague generalities. Students {{were then asked to}} choose which personality assessment they <b>believe</b> <b>was</b> their own, actual assessment. More than half of the students (59%) chose the fake assessment as opposed to the real one.|$|E
25|$|About {{two hours}} after the attack on La Rambla, a white Ford Focus rammed a police {{barricade}} in Avinguda Diagonal, leaving an officer injured. The vehicle fled to a neighboring area, Sant Just Desvern, and the driver abandoned the car near the building known as Walden 7. The police found a man stabbed {{to death in the}} rear seat whom, they <b>believe,</b> <b>was</b> murdered by the Ramblas driver who had escaped by hijacking the car.|$|E

25|$|Most sources documenting Germanic paganism have presumably been lost. From Iceland {{there is}} {{substantial}} literature, namely the Nordic Sagas and the Eddas, but most of this was written long after Iceland's conversion to Christianity. Some information {{is found in the}} Nibelungenlied. The closest literary source may be Beowulf, which some scholars <b>believe</b> <b>was</b> composed as early as the eighth century, and therefore within living memory of Anglo-Saxon paganism. Limited information also exists in Tacitus' ethnographic work Germania.|$|E
25|$|There were {{selective}} {{portions of}} al-Fadl's testimony that I <b>believe</b> <b>was</b> false, {{to help support}} the picture that he helped the Americans join together. I think he lied {{in a number of}} specific testimony about a unified image of what this organization was. It made al-Qaeda the new Mafia or the new Communists. It made them identifiable as a group and therefore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with al-Qaeda for any acts or statements made by bin Laden.|$|E
25|$|Birgenair Flight 301 was {{a flight}} {{chartered}} by Turkish-managed Birgenair partner Alas Nacionales from Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic to Frankfurt, Germany, via Gander, Canada, and Berlin, Germany. On 6 February 1996, the Boeing 757–225 operating the route crashed shortly after take-off from Puerto Plata's Gregorio Luperón International Airport. All 189 {{people on board}} died. The cause was a pitot tube that investigators <b>believe</b> <b>was</b> blocked by a wasp nest that was built inside it. The aircraft had sat unused for two days without the pitot tube covers in place.|$|E

25|$|Gregorio Fuentes, who {{many critics}} <b>believe</b> <b>was</b> an {{inspiration}} for Santiago, was a blue-eyed man born on Lanzarote in the Canary Islands. After going to sea at age ten on ships that called in African ports, he migrated permanently to Cuba when he was 22. After 82 years in Cuba, Fuentes attempted to reclaim his Spanish citizenship in 2001. Critics have noted that Santiago was also at least 22 when he immigrated from Spain to Cuba, and thus {{old enough to be}} considered an immigrant—and a foreigner—in Cuba.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the Slovak Republic in January 1993, Slovakia has undergone a transition from a centrally planned economy to a free market economy, a process which some observers were to <b>believe</b> <b>was</b> slowed in the 1994–98 period due to the crony capitalism and other fiscal policies of Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar's government. While economic growth and other fundamentals improved steadily during Mečiar's term, public and private debt and trade deficits also rose, and privatization was uneven. Real annual GDP growth peaked at 6.5% in 1995 but declined to 1.3% in 1999.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Gateway 2000 {{released}} The Destination, {{the first}} version of a smart TV, which included a 32-inch monitor and Harman Kardon surround sound. The $7,500 system had a shipping weight of over 300lbs. A pet project of Waitt's known by some employees as the Lisa-Nation, a reference to Steve Jobs early Apple Computer failure, Gateway tried to partner with east coast electronics retailer Nobody Beats the Wiz to market the product, and was thought {{to be one of the}} primary reasons for proliferation of Gateway Country Stores which, many <b>believe</b> <b>was</b> the reason for the company's ultimate failure.|$|E
