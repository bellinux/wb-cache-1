5|$|At {{a meeting}} in Paris in 1914, Piłsudski presciently {{declared}} that in the impending war, for Poland to regain independence, Russia must <b>be</b> <b>beaten</b> by the Central Powers (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the latter powers must in their turn <b>be</b> <b>beaten</b> by France, Britain and the United States. By contrast, Roman Dmowski, Piłsudski's rival, believed {{that the best way}} to achieve a unified and independent Poland was to support the Triple Entente against the Central Powers.|$|E

5|$|As {{punishment}} for his escape, he {{is forced to}} repeatedly dig a grave-sized hole in the prison camp yard, fill it back in, and then <b>be</b> <b>beaten.</b> The prisoners observe his persecution, singing spirituals. Finally, as the other prisoners watch from {{the windows of the}} bunkhouse, an exhausted Luke collapses in the hole, begging God for mercy and pleads with the bosses not to hit him again. Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain stops the punishment. Boss Paul warns Luke that he will be killed if ever he runs away again, which Luke promises in tears not to do.

Homer desperately tries to prevent the letter from reaching Mr. Burns, but fails. Mr. Burns becomes furious and demands that Homer <b>be</b> <b>beaten.</b> However, Smithers calls off the beating {{on the grounds that}} is no way to thank the man who saved Mr. Burns' life, and instead convinces Mr. Burns to instead reward the Simpson family. The Simpsons receive an antique Xtapolapocetl, an Olmec head (a massive, Tiki-god-like affair) that Bart, the blood donor, likes, and which Homer hates.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Gelimer {{remained}} blockaded by Pharas at {{the mountain}} stronghold of Medeus, {{but as the}} blockade dragged through the winter, Pharas grew impatient.

While a success for Gelimer, it did not alter his hopeless situation as he and his followers remained tightly blockaded and began to suffer from lack of food. Pharas sent him messages calling upon him to surrender and spare his followers the misery, {{but it was not until}} March that the Vandal king agreed to surrender after receiving guarantees for his safety. Gelimer was then escorted to Carthage.|$|E

5|$|Three men {{sought the}} Democratic {{nomination}} for governor at the 1899 party convention in LouisvilleGoebel, Wat Hardin, and William J. Stone. When Hardin {{appeared to be}} the front-runner for the nomination, Stone and Goebel agreed to work together against him. Stone's supporters would back whomever Goebel picked to preside over the convention. In exchange, half the delegates from Louisville, who were pledged to Goebel, would vote to nominate Stone for governor. Goebel would then drop out of the race, but would name many of the other officials on the ticket. As word of the plan spread, Hardin dropped out of the race, believing he would <b>be</b> <b>beaten</b> by the Stone–Goebel alliance.|$|E
5|$|During the Chunin exams, Team 7 {{encounters}} Orochimaru, an infamous ninja exiled from Konoha, who infects Sasuke with a curse mark. When active, {{the mark}} increases Sasuke's physical abilities, but makes him cruel and sadistic, as the mark contains {{a fragment of}} Orochimaru's consciousness. Soon after, Kakashi teaches Sasuke his own Chidori technique, attempting to appease his desire for power. During the siege of Konoha, Sasuke is beaten by Gaara, but is rescued by Naruto. Not long after, Itachi returns to Konoha and Sasuke attempts to kill him, only to <b>be</b> <b>beaten</b> and tortured. In response, Sasuke decides he has to leave Team 7 and Konoha {{in order to become}} stronger. Believing Orochimaru's tutelage will make him more powerful, Sasuke defects from Konoha and becomes an outlaw. Naruto follows him, and the two fight when Sasuke refuses to return. Sasuke wins, but he spares Naruto's life and continues on to Orochimaru's hideout to seek power.|$|E

5|$|Far more to Mao's liking {{were the}} {{accounts}} of war and banditry found in the Four Great Classical Novels, including Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West, and Water Margin; while also steeped in Confucian morality, they emphasised the need to fight for justice in society, {{and it is possible}} that these texts inspired his interest in history. According to his later account, it was at this point that he attained a strong belief in justice; he began to divide his lunch in two to share with a poorer boy who could not afford food. On another occasion, he got into a physical fight with an older classmate; this greatly upset his mother, who held pacifist beliefs. According to his later account, at one point he rebelled when the teacher tried to punish him for disobedience; rather than permitting himself to <b>be</b> <b>beaten</b> with a rod, he marched out of the school and into the wooded mountains. He remained there for three days, until being discovered by a family member and brought home.|$|E
5|$|He is {{critical}} of greed for gold, such as the absurdity of using the metal for coins in the early Republic. He gives examples of the way rulers proclaimed their prowess by exhibiting gold looted from their campaigns, such as that by Claudius after conquering Britain, and tells the stories of Midas and Croesus. He discusses why gold is unique in its malleability and ductility, far greater than any other metal. The examples given are its ability to <b>be</b> <b>beaten</b> into fine foil with just one ounce, producing 750 leaves four inches square. Fine gold wire can be woven into cloth, although imperial clothes usually combined it with natural fibres like wool. He once saw Agrippina the Younger, wife of Claudius, at a public show on the Fucine Lake involving a naval battle, wearing a military cloak made of gold. He rejects Herodotus's claims of Indian gold obtained by ants or dug up by griffins in Scythia.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} protect areas of Croatia away from Sectors North and South, the HV {{conducted}} defensive operations while the HVO started a limited offensive north of Glamoč and Kupres to pin down part of the VRS forces, exploit the situation and gain positions for further advance. On 5 August, the HVO 2nd and 3rd Guards Brigades attacked VRS positions north of Tomislavgrad, achieving small advances to secure more favourable positions for future attacks towards Šipovo and Jajce, while tying down part of the VRS 2nd Krajina Corps. As {{a consequence of the}} overall battlefield situation, the VRS was limited to a few counter-attacks around Bihać and Grahovo as it was short of reserves. The most significant counter-attack was launched by the VRS 2nd Krajina Corps on the night of 11/12 August. It broke through the 141st Brigade, consisting of the HV's reserve infantry, reaching the outskirts of Bosansko Grahovo, only to <b>be</b> <b>beaten</b> back by the HV, using one battalion drawn from the 4th Guards and the 7th Guards Brigade each, supported by the 6th and the 126th Home Guard Regiments.|$|E

5|$|The 'Beating of the bounds' is {{an ancient}} annual custom first carried out in 1612, which revives the {{traditional}} checking of the sea boundaries awarded to Poole by the Cinque Port of Winchelsea in 1364. The Admiral of the Port of Poole (the mayor) and other dignitaries, {{and members of the}} public sail {{from the mouth of the}} River Frome to Old Harry Rocks to confirm the Mayor's authority over the water boundaries of the harbour and check for any encroachments. As there are no physical landmarks that can <b>be</b> <b>beaten</b> at sea, traditionally children from Poole were encouraged to remember the bounds of their town by taking part in the 'Pins and Points' ceremony involving the beating of a boy and pricking of a girl's hand with a needle. In modern times, the acts have been symbolically carried out.|$|E
5|$|The player, as Yumetaro, must {{venture into}} the {{alternate}} dimension to rescue his new owner. The player character can jump and spawn stars above the horn on his head. The star is a central mechanic to the game, being necessary to defeat enemies found while also doubling as a platform, capable of being ridden to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. The player must make their way through six stages and six bosses to complete the game. Once the sixth boss is defeated, it is revealed that the girl is still missing and the game restarts from the beginning. To truly complete Gimmick!, the player must find a hidden area in each stage where a magic item resides. If one can obtain each all the magic items without losing every life (i.e. using no continues), a secret stage will appear in which an extra boss must <b>be</b> <b>beaten.</b> Only after this boss is defeated is the game completed in full, with a cutscene showing Yumetaro rescuing the girl and leading {{her back to the}} real world.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{was built}} with one {{stand before the}} opening of another in 1928 which could hold 18,000 people to replace an earth embankment. It hosted its first {{international}} match in March 1911 with a Welsh match against Scotland. Towards {{the end of its}} lifespan, the ground eventually was replaced by Cardiff Arms Park as increasing doubts mounted over the safety of the aging ground. The club record attendance in the ground is 57,893 which was achieved during a league match against Arsenal on 22 April 1953. The record stands to this day, and is unlikely to <b>be</b> <b>beaten</b> due to the scaling down of grounds throughout the 1970s and 1980s due to safety fears, which saw the ground capacity fall to 22,000. In its final years of its use, the club was forced to seek special dispensation from authorities {{in order to keep the}} remaining standing areas of the ground open as clubs at Championship level or above were given three years to redevelop their grounds to remove standing areas.|$|E
