5|$|Civil service examinations: In the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD), the xiaolian {{system of}} {{recruiting}} government officials through formal recommendations {{was the chief}} method of filling bureaucratic posts, although there was an Imperial Academy to train potential candidates for office and some offices required its candidates to pass formal written tests <b>before</b> <b>appointment.</b> However, {{it was not until}} the Sui Dynasty (581–618) that civil service examinations became open to all adult males not belonging to the merchant class (although having wealth or noble status were not requirements) and were used as a universal prerequisite for appointments to office, at least in theory. The civil service system was implemented on a much larger scale during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), when an elite core of dynastic-founding and professional families lost their majority in government to a broad strata of lesser gentry families from throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|The Minister of the Household (Guangluxun 光祿勳), {{also known}} as Superintendent of the Household and Supervisor of Attendants, was {{originally}} titled the Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace (Lang zhongling 郎中令) before 104 BC. He {{was responsible for the}} emperor's security within the palace grounds, external imperial parks, and wherever the emperor made an outing by chariot. However, to ensure that the emperor's entire safety was not entrusted to a single officer, the subordinates of the Minister of the Guards were given sole right to patrol the palaces' entrances and walls while the eunuchs guarded the emperor's private apartments and harem. Three of the five cadet corps commanded by the Minister of the Household were actually armed civilian nominees serving a period of probation <b>before</b> <b>appointment</b> to a government office; the other two corps were composed of imperial bodyguards who were never appointed to civilian offices. The former were often recommended by commandery-level Administrators as Filial and Incorrupt, while others could be relatives of high officials in central government. The Minister of the Household oversaw subordinate court advisors (Yi Lang /议郎） who advised the emperor and engaged in scholarly debates. They were allowed to openly criticize the emperor, participate in provincial inspections, and conduct mourning ceremonies for recently deceased kings and marquesses while installing their successors. Internuncios (Yezhe 謁者), led by a Supervisor of the Internuncios (Yezhe puye 謁者僕射), were subordinates of the Minister of the Household who participated in state ceremonies, condoled on behalf of the emperor for recently deceased officials, inspected public works and military camps along the frontiers, and acted as diplomats to the semi-autonomous fiefs and non-Han-Chinese peoples along the borders.|$|E

500|$|The young Air Force staged {{numerous}} public {{displays in}} its early years; on one such occasion over the Melbourne suburb of Essendon in September 1924, Anderson, Ray Brownell and another pilot {{took part in a}} mock dogfight while ace Harry Cobby gave a demonstration of balloon busting. During 1925–26, Anderson again took command of No.1 FTS, as well as occupying a position on the Air Board as Air Member for Personnel. He was posted to England between 1927 and 1929, attending RAF Staff College, Andover, and serving as Air Liaison Officer (ALO) to the British Air Ministry. On 23March 1927 he was promoted to wing commander. As ALO in 1928, he provided information to the Air Board concerning shortcomings of the de Havilland Hound light day bomber, then being strongly considered for the RAAF, that led to the Westland Wapiti being ordered instead. Returning to Australia in mid-1929, Anderson was for a short time in charge of No.1 AD, now based at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, <b>before</b> <b>appointment</b> to the Air Board as Air Member for Supply in October. He spent most of the 1930s in this position, aside from an acting role as Air Member for Personnel in 1933–34, and attendance at the Imperial Defence College, London, the following year. Anderson had no formal training in the supply field, and though regarded with affection was variously considered [...] "not quite on the same wave length as others" [...] and [...] "so immersed in the minutiae of administration that some important policy matters languished". His chronic shyness with women other than his unmarried sister also made him an object of fun in some quarters. [...] He was raised to group captain in December 1932 and air commodore in January 1938. Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1933 King's Birthday Honours, he was promoted Commander in the same order (CBE) in the 1934 New Year Honours.|$|E
2500|$|John Hicklin Hall (July 17, 1854 [...] July 27, 1937) was a {{politician}} and {{attorney in the}} U.S. state of Oregon. A native of the Portland area, {{he served in the}} Oregon House of Representatives in the early 1890s <b>before</b> <b>appointment</b> as the United States District Attorney for Oregon. As the federal prosecutor, he became involved in the Oregon land fraud scandal, in which several high-profile public officials conspired to defraud the government in acquiring land for a private entity. Hall was convicted, but subsequently pardoned, for failing to prosecute some of the participants.|$|E

2500|$|In the United Kingdom, anti-Masonic {{sentiment}} grew {{following the}} publication of Martin Short's 1989 book, Inside the Brotherhood (Further Secrets of the Freemasons). [...] The allegations made by Short led {{several members of the}} British Government to propose laws requiring Freemasons who join the police or judiciary to declare their membership publicly to the government amid accusations of Freemasons performing acts of mutual advancement and favour-swapping. [...] This movement was initially led by Jack Straw, Home Secretary from 1997 until 2001. In 1999, the Welsh Assembly became the only body in the United Kingdom to place a legal requirement on membership declaration for Freemasons. Currently, existing members of the police and judiciary in England are asked to voluntarily admit to being Freemasons. However, all first time successful judiciary candidates had to [...] "declare their freemasonry status" [...] <b>before</b> <b>appointment</b> until 2009, when – following a successful challenge in the European Court by Italian Freemasons – Jack Straw accepted that the policy was [...] "disproportionate" [...] and revoked it. Conversely, new members of the police are not required to declare their status.|$|E
2500|$|Founded in 1976, the Law School {{is named}} for Supreme Court Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo. Cardozo, {{who was born in}} 1870 in New York City, and was renowned for his integrity, social consciousness, and {{important}} opinions. Cardozo studied law at Columbia Law School from 1889–91 and subsequently rose to prominence during 23 years of private practice, becoming known as a lawyer’s lawyer <b>before</b> <b>appointment</b> to the New York State Court of Appeals in 1914. His tenure was marked by a number of original rulings, in tort and contract law in particular. This is partly due to timing; rapid industrialization was forcing courts to look anew at old common law components to adapt to new settings. He became the nation’s best-known and most admired state court judge. He added to his reputation through highly acclaimed off-the-bench writings, of which the most important is The Nature of the Judicial Process (1921). Shortly thereafter, Cardozo {{became a member of the}} group that founded the American Law Institute, which crafted a Restatement of the Law of Torts, Contracts, and a host of other private law subjects. He wrote three other books that also became standards in the legal world. By asking, and answering, the monumentally simple question, [...] "What is it that I do when I decide a case?", he helped many see the judicial role with greater clarity. In 1932, President Herbert Hoover appointed Cardozo to succeed Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. on the Supreme Court. In his six years as an Associate Justice, he handed down opinions that stressed the necessity for the law to adapt to the realities and needs of modern life. The New York Times said of Cardozo's appointment that [...] "seldom, if ever, in the history of the Court has an appointment been so universally commended." [...] Democratic Cardozo's appointment by a Republican president has been referred to as one of the few Supreme Court appointments in history not motivated by partisanship or politics, but strictly based on the nominee's contribution to law.|$|E
