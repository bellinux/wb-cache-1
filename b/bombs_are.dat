5|$|Acting as a NATO {{observer}} of Royal Air Force procedure, Petacchi is in SPECTRE's pay to hijack the bomber in mid-flight by killing its crew and flying {{it to the}} Bahamas. Once there, Petacchi is killed and the plane, with <b>bombs,</b> <b>are</b> taken by Emilio Largo (aka SPECTRE Number One) on board the cruiser yacht Disco Volante.|$|E
5|$|Unguided {{air-to-ground}} weaponry includes rocket pods, gravity {{bombs and}} Matra Durandal anti-runway munitions. Precision-guided munitions such as LGBs and satellite-guided <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> also {{compatible with the}} JF-17, as are other guided weapons such as anti-ship missiles and anti-radiation missiles. Pakistan planned to bring the Brazilian MAR-1 anti-radiation missile into service on its JF-17 fleet in 2014.|$|E
5|$|It {{is clear}} that John has an ulterior motive; first, he paralyses Gwen and locks her in a crate telling {{her that if she}} is not found in two hours, her main organs will stop working and she would die. He then finds Owen and Tosh, {{shooting}} the former in the hip. After letting Ianto go, he finally confronts Jack, who realises that the <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> an elementary 51st century confidence trick. Jack throws the device over the building, and John pushes him off the roof in retaliation.|$|E
50|$|In August 1945, on Truman's orders, two atomic <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> {{dropped on}} Japanese cities. The first <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> dropped on Hiroshima, {{and the second}} <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> dropped on Nagasaki by the B-29 bombers named Enola Gay and Bockscar respectively.|$|R
50|$|In Lucknow two <b>bomb</b> <b>were</b> {{found one}} {{triggered}} panic after explosion and other unexploded powerful live <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> deactivated by <b>bomb</b> disposal squads. Both the <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> planted in bicycles in civil court premises. Lucknow blast was mildest among all other blasts in Faizabad and Varanasi.|$|R
50|$|On 23 August 1973 a <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> {{found in}} an {{abandoned}} bag in Baker Street station ticket hall. The <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> defused.A week later another <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> found {{by a member of}} staff at the same station and was also defused. It was planted by the Provisional IRA.|$|R
5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is {{approached by}} the FBI when {{a series of}} <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> detonated in Washington, DC. Black's investigation soon reveals that the culprit seeks {{to be seen as}} a hero, setting off explosions in order to rescue people from the scenes; leaving Black to track down the fame-hungry bomber before more people are killed.|$|E
5|$|The Smithsonian Institution {{displayed}} a Little Boy (complete, except for enriched uranium), until 1986. The Department of Energy took the weapon {{from the museum}} to remove its inner components, so the bombs could not be stolen and detonated with fissile material. The government returned the emptied casing to the Smithsonian in 1993. Three other disarmed <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> {{on display in the}} United States; another is at the Imperial War Museum in London.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Leiter {{alert the}} Thunderball war room of their suspicions of Largo {{and join the}} crew of the American nuclear {{submarine}} Manta as the ransom deadline nears. The Manta chases the Disco Volante to capture it and recover the bombs en route to the first target. An undersea battle ensues between the crews, while Bond fights Largo. Bond, now very weak from his efforts to disable the bombs, tries to get away, but Largo corners him in an underwater cave and easily overpowers him. Before Largo can finish Bond off Domino shoots him with a spear gun. The <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> recovered and Bond is sent to hospital with Domino.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bomb</b> <b>is</b> {{placed on}} the lower path of a Mach-Zehnder {{interferometer}} with a single-photon light source. If the photon takes the lower path and the <b>bomb</b> <b>is</b> live, then the photon is absorbed and triggers the bomb; otherwise, if the <b>bomb</b> <b>is</b> a dud, the photon will pass through unaffected.|$|R
50|$|Five <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> detonated in Mahabodhi temple {{premises}} on 7 July 2013. 4 <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> also detonated in town while {{three were}} defused.|$|R
25|$|In early June 2008 an SC 1000 <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> dredged {{from the}} River Lea near Three Mills Island in London. The <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> defused and the {{explosive}} liquefied and pumped out using steam by bomb disposal {{officers from the}} Royal Engineers before the <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> destroyed in a controlled explosion after five days.|$|R
5|$|Bond {{investigates the}} {{hijacking}} of an Avro Vulcan loaded with two atomic bombs, {{which had been}} taken by SPECTRE. The organisation demands a ransom {{for the return of}} the bombs. Bond follows a lead to the Bahamas, where he meets up with his CIA counterpart and friend Felix Leiter. The pair suspect a rich playboy, Emilio Largo, and search the area around his yacht and then the area where they think the yacht may have travelled. After finding the plane—but without the nuclear devices on board—the two agents arrange for Largo's yacht to be tracked and ambushed once the <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> being moved by Largo.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} stages of World War II, the entire Cold War, {{and to a}} lesser extent afterwards, {{uranium-235}} has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (thermonuclear weapon) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion. Such <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process.|$|E
5|$|Turkey has {{the second}} largest {{standing}} military force in NATO, after the US Armed Forces, with an estimated strength of 495,000 deployable forces, according to a 2011 NATO estimate. Turkey {{is one of five}} NATO member states which are part of the nuclear sharing policy of the alliance, together with Belgium, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. A total of 90 B61 nuclear <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> hosted at the Incirlik Air Base, 40 of which are allocated for use by the Turkish Air Force in case of a nuclear conflict, but their use requires the approval of NATO.|$|E
50|$|In 2007 and 2008, {{unactivated}} <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> {{found in}} Maksimir during construction. In 2008 a <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> {{found in the}} nearby town of Sveta Nedelja.|$|R

5|$|Combat {{comes in}} the form of both avoidable random {{encounters}} and scripted fights where the camera is fixed within the fighting area: enemies and bosses are primarily drawn from Japanese folklore and mythology. Battles are triggered only when enemies are near, with the player character otherwise keeping their weapons sheathed. In combat, characters attack and guard using a single-button prompt, while another button accesses items such as healing potions. Continuously attacking triggers combos. Different moves include sword slashes combined with directional buttons, which have different effects such as throwing an enemy into the air with an upward slash. Additional offensive items such as smoke <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> acquired during the course of the game. At the end of each battle, experience points are awarded to the player character depending on how fast the battle was finished: leveling up increases a character's health, stats, and the amount of damage inflicted upon enemies.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{continuing}} to use the side-scrolling perspective introduced to the series by , A Link to the Past reverts to an overhead perspective {{similar to that of}} the original. While A Link to the Past still uses mechanics and concepts from the original game, it also introduces new elements and innovations. For instance, arrows are now separate items, as <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> in the original, instead of using a Rupee to fire an arrow. A Link to the Past also takes concepts from The Adventure of Link, such as the magic meter, which is used by items such as the Lamp. Control of Link is more flexible than in previous games, as he can walk diagonally and can run with the aid of the Pegasus Boots (Pegasus Shoes in the GBA version),although he cannot use the Pegasus boots diagonally. Link's sword attack was improved to swing sideways instead of merely stabbing forward; this gives his sword a broader range and makes combat easier. Link swings his sword as the default attack in future Zelda games, although stabbing is also possible in the later 3D incarnations.|$|E
25|$|While {{all modern}} nuclear weapons (fission and fusion alike) make some use of D-T fusion, {{in the public}} {{perception}} hydrogen <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> multi-megaton devices a thousand times more powerful than Hiroshima's Little Boy. Such high-yield <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> actually two-stage thermonuclears, scaled up to the desired yield, with uranium fission, as usual, providing most of their energy.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bombing</b> <b>is</b> {{a central}} plot feature of Hari Kunzru's 2007 novel My Revolutions, {{in which the}} <b>bomb</b> <b>is</b> the work of {{political}} radicals who are never caught.|$|R

25|$|In 1952, the 10.4-megaton Ivy Mike {{explosion}} {{was announced}} {{as the first}} hydrogen bomb test, reinforcing the idea that hydrogen <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> a thousand times more powerful than fission bombs.|$|E
25|$|About 1.5 kg of Neogel {{with metal}} ball-bearings {{was put in}} boat-shaped wooden cases in Jaipur and Hyderabad. In both cases, timers were used. The {{similarities}} in the signatures of the <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> shocking.|$|E
25|$|Many strikes {{have been}} carried out by Israeli Air Force attack {{helicopters}} (mainly the AH-64 Apache) that fire guided missiles toward the target, after Shin Bet supplies intelligence for the target. Sometimes, when heavier <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> needed, the strike is carried out by F-16 warplanes.|$|E
50|$|During the convention, two {{dynamite}} <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> discovered {{outside of}} the hall; a total of seven <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> discovered in the greater Philadelphia area during the convention. The discoveries of the <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> inadvertently {{released to the public}} by an emotional New York City police commissioner Lewis J. Valentine while discussing the New York World's Fair bombing that killed two police officers.|$|R
50|$|The Little Boy atomic <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> dropped over Hiroshima at 08:15 local time. Tibbets {{recalled}} {{that the city}} was covered with a tall mushroom cloud after the <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> dropped.|$|R

25|$|In 1961 and 1980, letter {{bombs were}} sent to Brunner while he was {{resident}} in Syria. As {{a result of the}} letter bomb he received in 1961, he lost an eye, and in 1980 he lost the fingers on his left hand when the parcel blew up in his hands. The senders of the letter <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> unknown.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to this, the U.S. military can also deploy smaller {{tactical nuclear weapons}} either through cruise missiles or with conventional fighter-bombers. The U.S. maintains about 400 nuclear gravity bombs capable of use by F-15, F-16, and F-35. Some 350 of these <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> deployed at seven airbases in six European NATO countries; of these, 180 tactical B61 nuclear bombs fall under a nuclear sharing arrangement.|$|E
50|$|Uttar Pradesh, Chief Secretary, Mr. Sinha said <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> made in Bihar. The {{material}} to make <b>bombs</b> <b>was</b> procured in Nepal {{which was then}} smuggled across the porous Indo-Nepal border.|$|R
2500|$|A doomsday bomb, made popular by Nevil Shute's 1957 novel, and {{subsequent}} 1959 movie, On the Beach, the cobalt <b>bomb</b> <b>is</b> a hydrogen <b>bomb</b> with a jacket of cobalt. The neutron-activated cobalt would have maximized the environmental damage from radioactive fallout.
