She decides to fight for her love and not become the victim, singing emotively: [...] "I don't want a broken heart / And I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl". Despite the desire to have her lover back, she sings, [...] "I know that I love you <b>but</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> just say / I don't want to love you in no kind of way". The woman gains confidence, and {{towards the end of the}} song, she wants to spend her life with her lover despite the previous letdowns.|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} commended by several critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "I've {{never met anyone}} like Forrest Gump in a movie before, {{and for that matter}} I've never seen a movie quite like 'Forrest Gump.' Any attempt to {{describe}} him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, <b>but</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream. The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction...The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths...What a magical movie." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that the film [...] "has been very well worked out on all levels, and manages the difficult feat of being an intimate, even delicate tale played with an appealingly light touch against an epic backdrop." [...] The film did receive notable pans from several major reviewers. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker called the film [...] "Warm, wise, and wearisome as hell." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said that the film [...] "reduces the tumult of the last few decades to a virtual-reality theme park: a baby-boomer version of Disney's America." ...|$|E

Indeed, he was: all of his interests were indulged despite a background of dire poverty, and he remarked of his celebrity in botanical circles that [...] "fame is not bread". He remained a gingham weaver and during his lifetime the sole financial benefit from his interests came when he raised a new hybrid lily– Tigridia conchiflora– in his garden and sold it to a Manchester nurseryman, Thomas Watkinson, for £10. His poverty caused him to be exempted from contributing to the book fund of the Prestwich Botanical Society from the mid-1820s, and he was later exempted from paying into the liquor funds of both that society and the wider-based group. These concessions demonstrate the extent to which his knowledge was appreciated and occurred despite the teetotal Hobson having to pay into a liquor fund of which by definition he took no advantage. Horsefield received £13 10s. from a subscription that was started in 1853 in another attempt to alleviate his penurious state. After his death on 6 March 1854, Esther, with whom he had six sons and five daughters, received £37 from this fund, and he left 37 bulbs of one of the earliest hybrid daffodils to be cultivated, Narcissus horsefieldii, that raised another £2 11s (£2.55). N. horsefieldii {{became one of the most}} popular and extensively grown varieties of daffodil.|$|E

[...] After this first series was over, one {{interviewer}} asked McGoohan {{if he would have}} liked the series to continue, to which he replied, [...] "Perhaps, <b>but</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> tell you this: I would rather do twenty TV series than go through what I went through under that Rank contract I signed {{a few years ago and}} for which I blame no one but myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his {{consumer}} {{guide for}} The Village Voice, Robert Christgau attributed the record's intense quality to [...] "the natural enthusiasm of an inspired collaboration", and remarked on its standing in Chicago blues, [...] "except maybe for B.B. King's Live at the Regal and Otis Spann's Walking the Blues (oh, {{there must be}} others, <b>but</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go on) I can't recall a better blues album than this." [...] In a later review for Blender, Christgau found Muddy Waters to be in [...] "virile voice" [...] and commented that [...] "all-star musicians and fresh prospects stimulate the excitement promised in the title." ...|$|E

"We knew {{we could}} have played better in that Test [...] The {{fact that we had}} got so close to the Blacks proved we were close to them in ability, and {{when it came to the}} third Test in Wellington, we had a sense of giving {{everything}} to salvage our reputation. New Zealand had not won a Test match against Australia in Wellington since 1982. Not so long ago, you might think, <b>but</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> tell you, that is a lifetime by New Zealand's standards. And what happened that day really angered me. We played as though our lives depended on it; we tackled them as though they were demons; we knocked them back and we kept at them, mercilessly hounding them when they had possession and flattening them in some shuddering tackles. Not surprisingly, it won us the Test, but immediately apparent was the question: why the hell hadn't we played like that in the first two Tests?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 11, 2012, {{an attack}} on the U.S. {{diplomatic}} mission in Benghazi took place, resulting in the death of U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The next day, Clinton also made a statement describing the perpetrators as [...] "heavily armed militants" [...] and [...] "a small and savage group – not the people or government of Libya." [...] Clinton also responded to the notion that the attack had been related to the reactions in Egypt and elsewhere to the anti-Islamic online video known as Innocence of Muslims, saying: [...] "Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. <b>But</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind." [...] She and President Obama appearing together in the White House Rose Garden the same day and vowed to bring the attackers to justice. On September 14 the remains of the slain Americans were returned to the U.S. Obama and Clinton attended the ceremony; in her remarks, Clinton said, [...] "One young woman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said 'Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam.'" ...|$|E
