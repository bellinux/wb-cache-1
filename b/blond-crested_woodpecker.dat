50|$|The <b>blond-crested</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Celeus flavescens) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Picidae, the woodpeckers, piculets and wrynecks.It is found in Brazil, southeastern Paraguay, and extreme northeastern Argentina. A small disjunct {{population}} occurs at the Amazon River mouth and upstream, including {{the southern part of}} Ilha de Marajo. The ochre-backed woodpecker is sometimes considered a subspecies.|$|E
50|$|In {{eastern and}} southeastern South America, the <b>blond-crested</b> <b>woodpecker</b> ranges in {{eastern and central}} {{portions}} of the cerrado; it is also {{in most of the}} caatinga. A small range of the bird, (disjunct), occurs {{at the mouth of the}} Amazon River and upstream for 800 km in the Amazon Basin; the range also covers the southern parts of Marajó Island.|$|E
50|$|The ochre-backed {{woodpecker}} (Celeus ochraceus) is {{a bird in}} {{the family}} Picidae that occurs over a large area of eastern Brazil. It was previously always considered as a subspecies of the <b>blond-crested</b> <b>woodpecker</b> but the authors of a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2015 argued {{that it should be}} treated as a distinct species. This recommendation was accepted by the International Ornithologists' Union and the online edition of the Handbook of the Birds of the World but the South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society has yet to rule on its status.|$|E

We report {{here on the}} <b>blond-crested</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Celeus flavescens) taking nectar from flowers of two canopy species, Spirotheca passifloroides (Bombacaceae) and Schwartzia brasiliensis (Marcgraviaceae), in the Atlantic forest of south-eastern Brazil. Spirotheca passifloroides blooms for three months in the austral winter, whereas S. brasiliensis blooms for two months in the summer. Flowers of both species produce large amounts of dilute nectar. Celeus flavescens visits several flowers per plant touching the anthers and stigmas with its head and throat, and thus acts as a pollen vector. We suggest that woodpeckers may be more frequent flower visitors than previously thought, and that feeding on ripe fruits may be a simple behavioural step for the origin of nectar feeding by Neotropical woodpeckers...|$|E

Insetos formam a dieta básica dos pica-paus, porém algumas espécies também se alimentam habitualmente de frutos e poucas espécies procuram flores para tomar néctar. Registramos aqui o joão-velho ou pica-pau-de-cabeça-amarela (Celeus flavescens) ao tomar néctar de flores em duas espécies de plantas do dossel, Spirotheca passifloroides (Bombacaceae) e Schwartzia brasiliensis (Marcgraviaceae), em Mata Atlântica do sudeste do Brasil. Spirotheca passifloroides floresce por três meses no inverno, ao passo que S. brasiliensis floresce ao longo de dois meses no verão. As flores de ambas as espécies produzem néctar abundante e diluído. Celeus flavescens visita várias flores por planta, tocando as anteras e os estigmas com a cabeça e o pescoço, assim agindo como polinizador. Sugerimos que visitas de pica-paus a flores sejam mais freqüentes do que o suposto e que se alimentar em frutos maduros seria um passo comportamental simples para a origem da tomada de néctar por pica-paus neotropicais...|$|E
