5|$|Politically, the Belgians did {{not trust}} the French. Marshal Philippe Pétain had {{suggested}} a French strike at Germany's Ruhr area using Belgium as a spring-board in October 1930 and again in January 1933. Belgium feared it would be drawn into a war regardless, and sought to avoid that eventuality. The Belgians also feared being drawn into a war {{as a result of}} the French–Soviet pact of May 1935. The Franco-Belgian agreement stipulated Belgium was to mobilise if the Germans did, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> not clear was whether Belgium would have to mobilise in the event of a German invasion of Poland.|$|E
25|$|Cuba {{developed}} slowly and, {{unlike the}} plantation {{islands of the}} Caribbean, had a diversified agriculture. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> most important was that the colony developed as an urbanized society that primarily supported the Spanish colonial empire. By the mid-18th century, its colonists held 50,000 slaves, compared to 60,000 in Barbados; 300,000 in Virginia, both British colonies; and 450,000 in French Saint-Domingue, which had large-scale sugar cane plantations.|$|E

25|$|Amongst {{other things}} this {{recommended}} a curator be appointed for the Commission’s holdings (John M. Scholes), retention of the York museum, creation of other regional museums (not {{carried out in}} the way proposed), a small relics display in the old Great Hall at Euston railway station (done on a temporary basis) and a large museum of collections elsewhere in London. For the latter, the former station at Nine Elms was originally favoured as a site, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> eventually opened in 1961 was the Museum of British Transport in a former bus garage in Clapham.|$|E
25|$|The {{borough of}} Croydon has 14 {{libraries}}, a joint library and a mobile library. Many of the libraries were built {{a long time}} ago and therefore have become outdated, so the council started updating a few including Ashburton Library which moved from its former spot into the state-of-the-art Ashburton Learning Village complex which is on the former site of the old 'A Block' of Ashburton Community School which is now situated inside the centre. The library is now on one floor. This format was planned to be rolled out across all of the council's libraries <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> seen as costing too much.|$|E

25|$|In total, some 800 {{modifications}} {{were made}} to the Redstone design in the process of adapting it for the Mercury program. The process of man-rating Redstone was so extensive that NASA quickly found themselves not using an off-the-shelf rocket, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> in effect a completely new one and thus negating all of the hardware and flight test data from previous Redstone and Jupiter-C launches. This created a series of disputes between Von Braun's team at ABMA and NASA, as the former preferred simply making the abort system as foolproof as possible so as to guarantee that the astronaut would be bailed out of a malfunctioning launch vehicle, while the latter favored maximum booster reliability to minimize the chance of aborts happening at all.|$|E

500|$|Cresswell was not {{buried at}} Knockholt and was {{possibly}} interred in the Bridewell graveyard.

When the newsreels were screened in cinemas, Churchill was booed with shouts of [...] "shoot him" [...] from audiences. His presence was controversial to many and the Leader of the Opposition, Arthur Balfour, remarked, [...] "He [...] was, I understand, in military phrase, in {{what is known as}} the zone of fire—he and a photographer were both risking valuable lives.

500|$|Oxford's {{boat was}} heavily criticised: [...] "it was {{everything}} <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> right", {{but it became}} quickly apparent that the Cambridge boat was too light for the conditions, and began taking on water from the moment it left the shore. Oxford made a good start and after the first mile, were two-to-three lengths ahead of Cambridge. [...] Conditions soon worsened: some of the steamboats in the flotilla following the crews looked [...] "bound to capsize". [...] By Hammersmith Bridge the Cambridge boat was [...] "ankle deep in water" [...] and was sinking under the rough water. [...] Oxford {{took the opportunity to}} extend their lead and pulled away from their opponents and the boats following.

500|$|The First Amendment bars Congress from [...] "abridging {{the freedom}} of speech, or of the press…." [...] U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens commented about this phraseology in a 1993 journal article: [...] "I {{emphasize}} the word 'the' in the term '{{the freedom of}} speech' because the definite article suggests that the draftsmen intended to immunize a previously identified category or subset of speech." [...] Stevens said that, otherwise, the clause might absurdly immunize things like false testimony under oath. Like Stevens, journalist Anthony Lewis wrote: [...] "The word 'the' can be read to mean what was understood {{at the time to}} be included in the concept of free speech." [...] <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> understood at the time is not 100% clear.

The Manchu prince Dorgon (1612–1650) treated these shipwrecked Japanese with respect, pitied them for their misfortune, and provided them with provisions and ships to return to Japan. When they returned to Japan, they were interrogated by Tokugawa authorities, and submitted a report to Tokugawa Iemitsu (r. 1623–1651) on their experiences in China. Just like in the case of Choe Bu, this account was published as the Dattan hyōryūki ("Account of drifting into the [...] Tartars", [...] ) and as the Ikoku monogatari ("Stories from a Foreign Land", [...] ).|$|E
