25|$|The Roadmap for the Integration of ASEAN in Finance is {{the latest}} {{regional}} initiative, which aims to strengthen regional self-help and support mechanisms. The implementation of the roadmap {{will contribute to the}} realisation of the ASEAN Economic Community that was launched by the ASEAN leaders in October 2003 in Bali. The AEC is the end-goal of economic integration as outlined in the ASEAN Vision 2020 and the Bali Concord II to establish a single market and production base, characterised by the free movement of goods, services, investment, and a freer flow of capital. The AEC will also facilitate the movement of business professionals, skilled labour, and talent within the region. As in the EU, adoption of an ASEAN common currency, when conditions are ripe, could be the final stage of the ASEAN Economic Community. Under the roadmap, approaches and milestones have been identified in areas deemed crucial to financial and monetary integration, namely: (a) capital market development, (<b>b)</b> <b>capital</b> account liberalisation, (c) financial services liberalisation, and (d) ASEAN currency co-operation. Capital market development entails promoting institutional capacity, including the legal and regulatory framework, as well as the facilitation of greater cross-border collaboration, linkages, and harmonisation between capital markets in the region. Orderly capital account liberalisation will be promoted with adequate safeguards against volatility and systemic risks. To expedite the process of financial services liberalisation, ASEAN has agreed on a positive list modality and adopted milestones to facilitate negotiations. Currency co-operation would involve exploration of possible currency arrangements, including an ASEAN currency payment system for trade in local goods to reduce the demand for US dollars and to help promote stability of regional currencies, such as by settling intra-ASEAN trade using regional currencies.|$|E

This paper discusses China’s globalization process and estimates an income generating function, incorporating trade and FDI variables.

It is found that (a) globalization exerts a decreasing impact on regional inequality; (<b>b)</b> <b>capital</b> input and infrastructure are the largest contributors to regional inequality; and (c) privatization helps equalize incomes across regions but its equalizing impact has diminished since 1992.

40|$|The {{incomplete}} contracting {{literature has}} postulated that vertical integration eliminates hold-up {{problems at the}} expense of lower-powered incentives because of central management’s inability to commit not to intervene in operations. Both these predictions, however, are undermined by the widespread practice of decentralization. First, non-integrated firms are seldom owner-managed and hence are plagued by similar commitment problems. Second, division managers are compensated mainly based on divisional performance, so that hold-up problems are likely to resurface in integrated firms. This paper develops a model where managers, who benefit from investment returns via compensation (incentives) and private benefits of control (“empire benefits”), negotiate the terms of trade under asymmetric information. I find that: (a) incentives are lower-powered; (<b>b)</b> <b>capital</b> investments are higher; and (c) bargaining is “more cooperative ” in verticall...|$|E

40|$|The present article {{develops}} a post-keynesian macrodynamic {{model in which}} {{the growth rate of}} real income is an endogenous variable in order to analyze the effects of capital controls over macroeconomic performance of emergent economies. For such we start from the models developed by Oreiro (2004) and Oreiro and Guerberoff (2004). I this framework is possible to reevaluate the impact of capitals controls over long-term dynamics of emergent economies, taking in account possible interactions <b>b</b> <b>capital</b> controls and economic growth. The first important conclusion is that the capitals controls do not affect the stability properties of the long-run equilibrium positions of the model. The simulation results show that introduction of capitals controls is a useful policy to reduce the level of domestic interest rate, to raise economic growth, to increase the degree of capacity utilization and to reduce the level of external indebtedness. However, the deficit in current account was relatively higher with capitals controls. ...|$|E

40|$|China {{appears to}} be taking various actions to {{increase}} the international role of its currency, the renminbi, through its greater use as a settlement currency in China’s exports and imports, and bilateral swap lines with a few central banks {{in the world that}} make the renminbi available to them. Some have started to talk about the eventual displacement of the U. S. dollar by the renminbi as the preeminent international reserve currency; others noted (perhaps with an audible sigh of relief) that many of the prerequisites for the renminbi to be a reserve currency are not fulfilled, and therefore the talk of the renminbi as a major international currency is way too premature. The list of prerequisites is said to include (a) a deep and liquid domestic financial market, including vibrant government and corporate bond markets, (<b>b)</b> <b>capital</b> account convertibility, (c) a flexible nominal exchange rate regime, (d) a stable domestic macroeconomic situation including low inflation and a government debt level within a sustainable threshold.
