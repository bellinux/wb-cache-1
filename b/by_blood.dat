5|$|Bonded <b>by</b> <b>Blood</b> is an American thrash metal band, {{named after}} Exodus' debut album Bonded <b>by</b> <b>Blood.</b> Like its labelmates Evile, Gama Bomb, and Municipal Waste, Bonded <b>by</b> <b>Blood</b> {{is part of}} the thrash metal revival movement. The band was formed in mid-2005 by vocalist Jose Barrales, who with the help of friends {{completed}} the band's original lineup with guitarist Alex Lee, drummer Carlos Regalado, and bassist Ruben Dominguez.|$|E
5|$|A year later, {{the band}} decided {{to enter into}} a battle of bands contest, which {{included}} over 250 musical ensembles. The music competition's prize was $3,000 and two days in a recording studio. The band then decided it was time for another guitarist, to fill in some of that empty sounds during guitar solo's and to add to the band for a more full sound live. Through friends, Barrales contacted guitarist Juan Juarez and asked him to join Bonded <b>by</b> <b>Blood.</b> Juarez accepted and he then met the rest of the members and they all liked him as well. After winning round after round, Bonded <b>by</b> <b>Blood</b> finally won first place. The band then recorded the demo Four Pints of Blood at Love Juice Labs in the Californian city of Riverside. With this demo, Bonded <b>by</b> <b>Blood</b> gave people something to listen to and it gave the band an audience.|$|E
5|$|Bonded <b>by</b> <b>Blood</b> {{along with}} its labelmates Evile, Gama Bomb, and Municipal Waste {{are part of the}} thrash metal revival movement. These young bands are {{bringing}} the classism of the new wave of British heavy metal and the aggressiveness of hardcore punk to a new generation of fans. Even though the members of Bonded <b>by</b> <b>Blood</b> were not born when their favorite 1980s thrash metal bands released their debut albums, the music and fashion of that era {{had a profound impact on}} them.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{correlative}} epidemiological studies have implicated selenium deficiency (measured <b>by</b> <b>blood</b> levels) {{in a number}} of serious or chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. In addition, selenium supplementation {{has been found to be}} a chemopreventive for some types of cancer in some types of rodents.|$|E
5|$|Bonded <b>by</b> <b>Blood</b> {{commenced}} {{the recording}} of its first full-length, Feed the Beast, in January 2008 at J Street studios in Sacramento, California with producer Michael Rosen. At first, the recording sessions were going well, but when the band finish off Rosen began to manipulate the songs in ways that musicians were not enjoying it. The band then decided to re-record the album in the same studio where they recorded the Extinguish the Weak EP. Earache released Feed the Beast on May 9 in the United Kingdom and June 24 in the United States. Bonded <b>by</b> <b>Blood</b> supported the album with the Thrashing Like a Maniac tour. They toured the United States between June and July along with Fueled by Fire and Merciless Death, and in Europe between September and October with Gama Bomb headlining.|$|E
5|$|Hailing from Pomona, California, {{the members}} of Bonded <b>by</b> <b>Blood</b> met through mutual friends. The idea of {{creating}} a band was conceived by lead vocalist Jose Barrales, a singer with hardcore punk and crossover thrash backgrounds, influenced by groups like The Blackheads, Cryptic Slaughter, D.R.I. and Black Flag. He always had an appreciation for heavy metal music, {{but it was not}} until a friend recommended him to listen to Exodus that Barrales got into the thrash metal subgenre. Exodus' debut album Bonded <b>by</b> <b>Blood</b> had a profound impact on Barrales, and it was inspiring to the point he idealized the creation of a thrash metal band, as he had noticed that there were few or even no groups in this genre in the music scene.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Knauf {{overlaid}} the Avatars of {{the fictional}} universe with an elaborate order of succession <b>by</b> <b>blood,</b> similar to the ascent of royal families. The descriptors Royals, King and Prince are replaced in the series with Vectori, Prophet and Prince. Female royals like Queens and Princesses {{do not have a}} fictional counterpart and are instead replaced with the concepts of the Alpha, the Omega and the Usher. These Wild Card Avatars have special rules in addition to, or replacing, the normal ones. Reviewers rarely focused on the significance of the mentioned Avataric terms and their implied characteristics in the story, despite detailed explanations by Knauf and the later public availability of Carnivàles Pitch Document, setting out the complex mythological structure.|$|E
5|$|Filitti's death {{occurred}} {{shortly before}} a Romanian communist regime came into existence. He was {{survived by his}} wife and son. An aristocrats <b>by</b> <b>blood</b> and conservatives by conviction, Ioan C.'s descendants and relatives suffered heavily {{as a result of the}} new policies: the outspoken anti-communist Filitti-Robănești became a political prisoner, as did his cousin Puiu Filitti, who had been the King's Adjutant. Alexandrina Filitti was stripped of virtually all her land during the land reform and nationalization, but still forced to meet agricultural quotas imposed by the government; when she failed to do so, Manole Filitti took it upon himself to face the consequences, and spent some three years in communist jails.|$|E

5|$|Grand Duke Vytenis' origins are {{relatively}} well-established; {{he was the}} son of Butvydas, who was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1291 to 1295. No consensus exists about the identity of Butvydas' father. While some genealogies give Traidenis as the ancestor, this has been described as unlikely: the later marriage of Gediminas' daughter Eufemija and Traidenis' great-grandson Boleslaw-Yuri would have violated canon law, since the two would have been related <b>by</b> <b>blood,</b> and this violation would likely have been noticed by the pope.|$|E
5|$|Groups often {{form when}} {{individuals}} converge on a food source, whereupon {{a feeding frenzy}} may occur. This seems to be triggered not <b>by</b> <b>blood</b> in the water or by bloodlust, but by the species' highly strung and goal-directed nature (conserving energy between infrequent feeding opportunities {{when it is not}} slowly plying the open ocean). The oceanic whitetip is a competitive, opportunistic predator that exploits the resource at hand, rather than avoiding trouble in favour of a possibly easier future meal.|$|E
5|$|Hemorrhagic cystitis, {{characterized}} <b>by</b> <b>blood</b> in the urine, {{can occur}} secondary {{to a number}} of causes including: infections, radiation therapy, underlying cancer, medications and toxins. Medications that commonly cause this problem include the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide with rates of 2 to 40%. Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare condition where eosinophiles are present in the bladder wall. Signs and symptoms are similar to a bladder infection. Its cause is not entirely clear; however, it may be linked to food allergies, infections, and medications among others.|$|E

5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{can occur}} in those with acute or chronic liver disease. Episodes can be triggered by infections, GI bleeding, constipation, electrolyte problems, or certain medications. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the build up of ammonia in the blood, a substance that is normally removed by the liver. The diagnosis is typically made after ruling out other potential causes. It may be supported <b>by</b> <b>blood</b> ammonia levels, an electroencephalogram, or a CT scan of the brain.|$|E
5|$|Humans are not {{appropriate}} prey because the shark's digestion is {{too slow to}} cope with a human's high ratio of bone to muscle and fat. Accordingly, in most recorded shark bite incidents, great whites broke off contact after the first bite. Fatalities are usually caused <b>by</b> <b>blood</b> loss from the initial bite rather than from critical organ loss or from whole consumption. From 1990 to 2011 there have been a total of 139 unprovoked great white shark bite incidents, 29 fatal.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Bonded <b>by</b> <b>Blood</b> won {{a battle}} of bands that {{featured}} over 250 musical groups. With the contest prize, the band recorded the demo Four Pints of Blood {{and a year later}} they self-financed the recording of the EP Extinguish the Weak, releasing the songs through their MySpace page. The band attracted the attention of Earache Records, which signed them in late 2007. The band released its first full length Feed the Beast in 2008. While on tour Dominguez left the band and was replaced by bassist Jerry Garcia, who had his debut on Bonded by Blood's second full length Exiled to Earth, released in 2010.|$|E

The band's founding member was replaced by Mauro Gonzales from local band Mutants of War. The new lineup have been rehearsing for the upcoming tour dates. In early 2011 Jerry left the band for personal and financial reasons and Alex Lee left the band to join Holy Grail. On October 8, 2011 they welcomed Jessie Sanchez (ex Holy Grail) into the group as their new bassist.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the area}} resembles Pennsylvania in climate, {{vegetation}} and wildlife. The park is near the southern limit for eastern hemlock and eastern white pine. Coves in the area vary by elevation and topography, with second-growth oak and hickory more common in lower-lying areas. The surrounding forests contain rich, high-altitude flora including rare wildflowers and ferns, such as Persistent Trillium, which grows near Rhododendron. Nearby boulderfields <b>by</b> <b>Blood</b> Mountain include Dutchman's breeches, squirrel corn, waterleaf and other herbaceous plants.|$|E
