40|$|Abstract. We study various {{generating}} {{operators of}} a given odd Poisson <b>bracket</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> supermanifold. They arise as the operators that map a function to the divergence of the associated hamiltonian derivation, where divergences of derivations can be defined either in terms of berezinian volumes or of graded connections. Examples include generators of the Schouten <b>bracket</b> of multivectors <b>on</b> <b>a</b> manifold (the supermanifold being the cotangent bundle where the coordinates in the fibres are odd), generators of the Koszul-Schouten <b>bracket</b> of forms <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Poisson manifold (the supermanifold being the tangent bundle, with odd coordinates on the fibres) and the “odd laplacian”, ∆, of Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{two classes of}} Poisson <b>brackets</b> <b>on</b> algebras (or on sheaves of algebras). We call them locally free and nonsingular Poisson brackets. Using the Fedosov’s method we prove that any locally free nonsingular Poisson bracket can be quantized. In particular, it follows from this that all Poisson <b>brackets</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary field of characteristic zero can be quantized. The well known theorem about the quantization of nondegenerate Poisson <b>brackets</b> <b>on</b> smooth manifolds follows from the main result of this paper as well. ...|$|R
