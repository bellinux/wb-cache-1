5|$|Several journalists {{hypothesized}} that the Johnson–Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness ("Showtime") and Boston/Indiana blue collar grit ("Celtic Pride"), and <b>between</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites.</b> The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings. With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won {{a whole generation of}} new fans, drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's public park flair. According to sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN, Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from bankruptcy.|$|E

25|$|The {{period after}} World War I was {{disruptive}} in the United States as numerous veterans sought to re-enter {{the job market}} and society. The government had no program to help them. Racial antagonism erupted in 1919 as race riots of whites against blacks in numerous cities across the North and Midwest; {{it was called the}} Red Summer of 1919. Unlike in mob action in the South, blacks in Chicago and other cities fought back against these attacks. After the riots subsided, racial relations <b>between</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> remained strained and volatile.|$|E

25|$|The Rhodesian economy {{experienced}} a modest {{boom in the}} early 1970s. Real per capita earnings for blacks and whites reached record highs, although the disparity in incomes <b>between</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> remained, with blacks earning only about one-tenth as much as whites. After 1975, however, Rhodesia's economy was undermined by the cumulative effects of sanctions, declining earnings from commodity exports, worsening guerilla conflict, and increasing white emigration. When Mozambique severed economic ties, the Ian Smith regime was forced to depend on South Africa {{for access to the}} outside world. Real gross domestic product (GDP) declined between 1974 and 1979, before full independence in 1980. An increasing proportion of the national budget, an estimated 30%–40% per year, was allocated to defence, and a large budget deficit raised the public debt burden substantially.|$|E
500|$|To this end, Welensky {{organised}} {{a conference}} in February 1949 to investigate {{the idea of a}} federation. Held at the Victoria Falls Hotel (a common venue for Rhodesian political conferences), representatives from the Northern and Southern Rhodesian Governments were present, but native Africans and the British Government were not. It was agreed that continued pushes for amalgamation would fail, with both the British and native Africans opposed. Welensky suggested that the Constitution of Australia be used as a basis for the proposed federal constitution, and pushed the idea of 'partnership' <b>between</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites.</b> However, he insisted that [...] "for as long as I can see, in that partnership [...] will be senior partners".|$|E

[...] His plan did not include black equality, suggesting that legislation and foresight would ensure relations <b>between</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> would not materially change.

[...] As of October 2007, the city of Omaha, the 42nd largest in the country, has the fifth highest percentage of low-income African Americans in the country. Census data from 2000 in Douglas County show more than 7,800 families live below the poverty line, about 6.7 percent of families.

500|$|Race, like in {{the rest}} of the series, is a central theme in The Heart of a Woman. The book opens with Angelou and Guy living in an {{experimental}} commune with white people, trying to participate in the new openness <b>between</b> <b>Blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites.</b> She is not completely comfortable with the arrangement; Angelou never names her roommates, even though [...] "naming" [...] has been an important theme in her books thus far. For the most part, Angelou is able to get along well with whites, but she occasionally encounters prejudice, as when she needs help from white friends to rent a home in a segregated neighborhood. Hagen calls Angelou's descriptions of whites and the hopes for eventual equality in this book [...] "optimistic". Angelou continues her indictment of white power structure and her protests against racial injustice.|$|E
500|$|Phillips's {{interpretation}} of slavery was challenged by Kenneth M. Stampp in The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the Ante-Bellum South (1956) and Stanley M. Elkins in Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life (1958). Stampp's study lacks the racist interpretation found in American Negro Slavery and approaches the {{issue from the}} position {{that there is no}} innate difference <b>between</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites.</b> He questions the reality of plantation paternalism described by Phillips: [...] "the reality of ante-bellum paternalism ... needs to be separated from its fanciful surroundings and critically analyzed." [...] Elkins also dismisses Phillips's claim that African American slaves were innately submissive [...] "Sambos". He argues that slaves had instead been infantilized, or [...] "made" [...] into Sambos, by the brutal treatment received at the hands of slaveowners and overseers. Elkins compares the process to the infantilization of Jews in Nazi concentration camps.|$|E

500|$|Trotter's father {{broke through}} many racial {{obstacles}} placed before him, but was often frustrated in {{his attempts to}} gain equal treatment or fair consideration. [...] While serving in the Union Army, he protested the inequality of pay <b>between</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites.</b> [...] In Boston {{he was the first}} man of color to be employed by the Post Office Department (now the U.S. Postal Service), a job he left after he was repeatedly passed over for promotion because of discriminatory Republican-led federal government policy. [...] Politically active, the elder Trotter was a leading African-American Democrat in New England. He supported Grover Cleveland for President, and was rewarded in 1886 when Cleveland appointed him Recorder of Deeds for the District of Columbia, the highest federal position filled by black men at the time. Two other prominent men of color of that era, Fredrick Douglass and Senator Blanche Kelso Bruce, also held the post. [...] The job was a lucrative one, and the Trotter family prospered.|$|E

For the most part, Angelou was able to freely interact with whites in this book, but she occasionally encountered prejudice similar to earlier episodes, like when she required the assistance of white friends to rent a home in a segregated neighborhood. Lupton stated that compared to her other books, Angelou had come [...] "a long way" [...] from her interactions with whites and people of other races. [...] Hagen called the descriptions of whites and the hopes for eventual equality in this book [...] "optimistic". [...] Angelou continued, however, her indictment of white power structure and her protests against racial injustice that had been a theme throughout all her books. Instead of offering solutions, however, she simply reported on, reacted to, and dramatized events.|$|E
500|$|History {{views the}} results of the [...] "Tuskegee Airmen Experiment" [...] as a {{tremendous}} success, in which Parrish played a significant role, and proved that blacks could perform well in both leadership and combat roles. Parrish felt people should be judged by their capability, not their color. During its development Parrish would often return from Washington DC depressed because of the massive resistance to the Tuskegee program. Decades later at Tuskegee Airmen reunions, when Parrish's name was called everyone applauded with a standing ovation. The experience of the AAF during World War II necessitated that the military review its policies on the utilization of black servicemembers. Confrontation, discussion, and coordination with both black and white groups led AAF leaders to the conclusion that active commitment, leadership, and equal opportunity produced a more cost-effective, viable military force. In 1948, President Harry Truman signed an Executive Order on equality of treatment and opportunity in the military, due in no small part to the successes of the Tuskegee Airmen. Parrish was commander of Tuskegee Field from 1942 to 1946 and historians generally give him credit for improving morale, living conditions, relations <b>between</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites,</b> and relations with local citizens.|$|E

500|$|The 1920s in the United States was {{a period}} marked by {{considerable}} anxiety and discussion over the crossing of racial boundaries, the so-called [...] "color line" [...] <b>between</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites.</b> This anxiety was exacerbated by the Great Migration, in which {{hundreds of thousands of}} blacks left the rural south for northern and midwestern cities, where, together with new waves of immigrants, they changed the social makeup. The practice of persons [...] "crossing the color line"—attempting to claim recognition in another racial group than the one they were believed to belong to—was known as [...] "passing". As many African Americans had European ancestry in varying proportions, some appeared visibly European. The legacy of slavery, with its creation of a racial caste, and the imposition in the early 20th century of the so-called one-drop rule (by which someone with even one ancestor of sub-Saharan-African origin was considered black) led to a hardening of racial lines that had historically been more fluid; at any time, the concept of race was [...] "historically contingent." [...] Although the exact numbers of people who passed is, for obvious reasons, not known, many estimates were made at the time. The sociologist Charles S. Johnson (1893–1956) calculated that 355,000 blacks had passed between 1900 and 1920.|$|E
2500|$|According to many historians, {{economic}} negotiations <b>between</b> <b>Blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Whites</b> in the South thus unfolded {{within the}} parameters {{dictated by the}} Johnson administration. Southern plantation owners pushed Blacks toward servitude, while the Republican Congress pushed for free wage labor and civil rights. Eventually, under this framework, sharecropping emerged as the dominant mode of production. Some historians, such as Robert McKenzie, have challenged the prevalence of this [...] "standard scenario" [...] and argued that land ownership fluctuated significantly during the 1870s. Black land ownership did increase across the South.|$|E
