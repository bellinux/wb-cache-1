5|$|Emraan Hashmi, who {{appeared}} in the original film, was initially chosen to play the lead role. However, Luthria was looking for an older actor and chose Kumar {{for the role of}} Shoaib Khan (based on Dawood Ibrahim). In February 2012 it was announced that there were two male leads in the film, the second said to be Shahid Kapoor, but the following month Imran Khan was confirmed as the second male lead. Many actresses were considered for the female lead, including Illeana D'Cruz, Kareena Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut, Asin Thottumkal, Sonam Kapoor and Deepika Padukone, but in April it was reported that Sonakshi Sinha had been cast. Sonali Bendre was also signed as a lead character in the film. The film marked Bendre's first role since Shankar Dada MBBS. Bendre did not charge her fees for the film owing to the fact that Sobha Kapoor, one of the producers of the film has been the friend of her Mother-in-law for the past 40 years also out of gratitude for Luthria, who shot her first song Sambhala hai Maine in the 1994 film Naaraaz. In November 2012, it was announced that the film was scheduled for release on Eid 2013. TV actor Chetan Hansraj was signed as an antagonist in the film. Kumar revealed during the trailer launch of the film about having no aspirations to set new benchmarks on a role previously enacted by Hashmi. Khan in preparation {{for his role in the}} film drew inspiration from Jackie Shroff and Anil Kapoor, copying their mannerisms, behaviour and dressing style by watching DVD's of films starring them produced in the 1980s. <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> days copying mannerism of film stars drew appreciation from peers.|$|E
25|$|Bali Jatra: The festival which Cuttackis {{look forward}} to most is the Bali Jatra. Bali Yatra is {{supposedly}} the second largest trade festival in Asia and the largest in India. The name Bali Jatra literally means A Voyage to Bali. In olden times, merchants used to trade with South-East Asian Island Countries of Bali, Java, sumatra, Borneo. Whatever items they brought from those places after trading Oriya goods used to be put up {{for sale in the}} capital (which was then Cuttack). People from all over the state and beyond used to come to Cuttack to buy these items. Bali Jatra is the festival of continuing this ancient tradition. It is held every year in November {{on the banks of the}} Mahanadi. Many stalls are set up selling both local and exotic goods. People from all over Odisha come to the Bali Jatra to buy items, as was the custom <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> days.|$|E
500|$|O'Leary {{also worked}} in the early 1970s to exclude trans people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for trans people would be too {{difficult}} to attain. Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [...] upstate New York, but later returned to {{the city in the}} mid-1990s to advocate for homeless members of the gay community. The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: [...] "Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now." [...] "It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites {{and at the same time}} criticize the feminists who were doing their best <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> days to exclude lesbians?" ...|$|E

500|$|According to writer Peter Buckley, {{the record}} {{presented}} a faster, [...] "thrashier kind of heavy metal". Steve Huey of AllMusic opined {{that the music}} on Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! is predominantly [...] "chaotic", accompanied by [...] "lightning-fast" [...] solo sections. Sputnikmusic's Mike Stagno said that the original pressing greatly suffered from the poor production, which made the record difficult to listen to. However, {{he noted that the}} music is performed at rapid speed, with precise riffing by both Poland and Mustaine. In his book , editor Jeff Wagner wrote the album displayed unusual rhythms and unorthodox guitar riffs, which carried [...] "like a runaway train". Speaking about the intensity of the record, Ellefson said that [...] "extreme speed was deemed the cool factor in thrash metal <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> days". Although Ellefson considers the album as a solid debut release, he wanted some of the songs to be recorded in slower tempo.|$|E
2500|$|Until the 1970s, the {{ridership}} {{continued to}} grow heavily, which surprised even the builders of the line. In 1959 the number of travellers reached over 50 million passengers annually. About 152,700 residents were said to live within a distance no more than 800 metres from SKM stations. [...] More than 40% of the Tricity population used this means of urban transport. [...] However, {{this led to a}} problem that is still [...] evident to this day—crowding in the trains. [...] <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> days, some people were forced to ride {{on the outside of the}} trains.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{musician}} Weldon [...] "Big Bill" [...] Lister, {{who performed}} in the Hadacol Caravan, [...] "The only way you could get into that show was with a Hadacol boxtop, And believe me, we played to crowds of ten, twelve thousand people a night. <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> days there wasn't many auditoriums that would hold that many people. We played ball parks, race tracks - you know anywhere where they had enough big bleachers to handle those kind of crowds." [...] The final show was on 17 September 1951. Paul Schrader wrote a script entitled Eight Scenes from the Life of Hank Wlliams, which {{has not yet been}} produced. It includes a sequence on his performances with the Hadacol Caravan.|$|E

50|$|Powell {{began his}} American {{professional}} career {{after he was}} drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles and put together an impressive rookie season in 1959, finishing second in kickoff returns with a 27-yard average while serving as a reserve defensive <b>back.</b> Included <b>in</b> <b>those</b> returns was a 95-yard touchdown run against the New York Giants on October 4 that jolted the defending conference champions in a 49-21 defeat.|$|R

2500|$|Subsequent {{legislation}} amended ACTAAP {{to conform}} to No Child Left Behind. Later, in 2005, Huckabee stated, [...] "And one thing I salute about [...] is No Child Left Behind, {{and no matter what}} you've heard about it let me tell you it's {{the best thing that ever}} happened in education because it says we're not going to let children spend years and years and let taxpayers spend thousands and thousands of dollars only to find out when the kid graduates high school that he's basically a functional illiterate, that we're not going to leave him lingering <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> classrooms and that he or she will get a decent education and we will hold accountable those who are responsible for getting that child a good education." ...|$|E
2500|$|Western swing {{began in}} the dance halls of small towns {{throughout}} the lower Great Plains in the late 1920s and early 1930s, growing from house parties and ranch dances where fiddlers and guitarists played for dancers. During its early development, scores of groups from San Antonio to Shreveport to Oklahoma City played different songs with the same basic sound. Prince Albert Hunt's Texas Ramblers out of Terrell in East Texas, and the East Texas Serenaders in Lindale, Texas, both added jazz elements to traditional music in the later half of the 1920s through the early 1930s. Fred [...] "Papa" [...] Calhoun recalled that around 1930, he played in a band in Decatur, Texas that played [...] "a lot of swing stuff like the Louisiana Five was playing <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> days. We also liked Red Nichols and Bix Beiderbecke." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> days [...] it was RCA, our {{record label}} then, {{went over the}} edge with Virgin Killer. Today {{when you think of}} child {{pornography}} on the net, you would never do something like that. We never did this in the sense of pornography, we did it in the sense of art. It is about the song and the label was pushing the idea because they wanted to get the controversy to help the album sale and you cannot get better promotion than that. Looking back from the band point of view it was never an album cover that we took home to our parents and said, [...] "Look what we just released.." [...] There was always mixed feelings about it and even 30 years later it caused a scandal at Wikipedia because the site for that album was blocked and even the FBI was getting involved. All of that after so many years, can you believe that? ...|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, Sura Al-Baqara 2:190-193 of the Quran {{requires}} that in combat Muslims are only allowed to strike <b>back</b> <b>in</b> self-defense against <b>those</b> who strike against them, but, {{on the other}} hand, once the enemies cease to attack, Muslims are then commanded to stop attacking.|$|R
50|$|Stories {{about local}} characters, like Rōnu Eduru, Kuda Tuttu Didi, Kalhukuru or Naalaafushi Fagīru (the poor man of Naalaafushi) {{give us a}} glimpse on {{the way of life}} in the Maldives when the {{archipelago}} was a kingdom, and Malé, the capital, was a quaint, laid <b>back</b> place. <b>In</b> <b>those</b> stories we learn much about the life in the court in Malé and about the mutual interaction between the Radun (the king of Maldives) and his subjects.|$|R
5000|$|In 1918 Ludwig Schunk {{moved the}} company, {{operated}} in rented premises, from Fulda to Heuchelheim near Giessen {{where he was}} able to buy the former tourist restaurant [...] "Windhof" [...] which had sufficient space to set up production equipment. As far <b>back</b> as <b>in</b> <b>those</b> early days, the first representation offices were founded in various large German cities and export business was set up. In the next few years, this new company acquired a sound reputation with customers and competitors.|$|R
2500|$|Bhutto {{was highly}} {{confident}} that her party would secure an overwhelming {{victory in the}} coming Senate elections in 1999, due to the prime minister's widening unpopularity. Controversially, when the Pakistani armed forced initiated a coup d'état, Bhutto neither criticised nor issued any comment, remaining silent on supporting General Musharraf, as Dalrymple notes. She continued to support Musharraf's coordinated arrests of the supporters and staff of Sharif. Musharraf destroyed Sharif's political presence in Sindh and Kashmir provinces. [...] Many political offices in Sharif's constituency or district were forcibly closed and many sympathisers were jailed. In 2002, Bhutto and the MQM made a side-line deal with Musharraf that allows both to continue underground political activities in Sindh and Kashmir, and {{to fill the gap}} after Musharraf had destroyed Sharif's presence in the both provinces. The effects of the arrests was seen clearly in the 2008 parliamentary elections, when Nawaz Sharif failed to secure support <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> two provinces.|$|E

50|$|On October 21, 1952, it was {{announced}} that the Windsor Royals had withdrawn from the ORFU, meaning that their three remaining games would be canceled. The Royals had lost all nine games that season and had not won a game since 1950. As a result, attendance at games was dwindling, causing problems with funding and being able to pay players. While there were plans to come <b>back</b> <b>in</b> 1953, <b>those</b> plans never came to fruition, and the Windsor football club folded after the 1952 season.|$|R
50|$|Barranco spent Christmas in {{his family}} house, and got <b>back</b> <b>in</b> touch with his friends in Jerez. As one of them recalls:since his return to Jerez we often met and we talk much, you could feel in {{conversation}} {{that he was a}} communist, he didn't say it, but he didn't deny it either. You mustn't bring malicious gossip over yourself <b>back</b> then. <b>In</b> <b>those</b> days Grimau was arrested and half dead since he had been pushed in front of a window located in the General Security Department, just to wind up executed by shooting. Francoist information services were aware of this affiliation and he was under surveillance since he crossed the border.|$|R
2500|$|On 1 July 2005, the leu was revalued at {{the rate}} of 10,000 [...] "old" [...] lei (ROL) for one [...] "new" [...] leu (RON), thus psychologically {{bringing}} the purchasing power of the leu <b>back</b> <b>in</b> line with <b>those</b> of other major Western currencies.

60|$|There was {{a dinner}} such as Shefford {{had not seen}} for many a day, and such as Fay had never seen, and that brought to Jane Withersteen's eyes the dreamy memory of the {{bountiful}} feasts which, long years ago, had been her pride.
