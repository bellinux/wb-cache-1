5|$|By 1916, the Great War {{had been}} ongoing {{for almost two}} years, during which anarchists had taken part in anti-war {{movements}} across Europe, issuing numerous anti-war statements in anarchist and leftist publications. In February 1915, a statement was issued by an assembly of anarchists from various regions, including England, Switzerland, Italy, the United States, Russia, France, and the Netherlands. The document was signed by such figures as Domela Nieuwenhuis, Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Luigi Bertoni, Saul Yanovsky, Harry Kelly, Thomas Keell, Lilian Wolfe, Rudolf Rocker, and George Barrett. It was also endorsed by Errico Malatesta and Alexander Schapiro, two of three secretaries elected to their position at the Anarchist International of 1907. It set out several viewpoints, including that all wars {{were the result of}} the current system of society, and therefore not the blame of any particular government; did not regard a defensive and offensive war as being fundamentally distinctly different; and encouraged all anarchists to support only class conflict and the liberation of oppressed populaces as a means <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> resolve wars between nation-states.|$|E
5|$|On Allen's {{return to}} Bennington, the {{settlers}} {{met at the}} Catamount Tavern to discuss their options. These discussions resulted {{in the formation of}} the Green Mountain Boys in 1770, with local militia companies in each of the surrounding towns. Allen was named their Colonel Commandant, and cousins Seth Warner and Remember Baker were captains of two of the companies. Further meetings resulted in the creation of committees of safety, and laid down rules <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> resist attempts by the New York provincial government to establish its authority. These included denying surveyors sent by the province the ability to survey any land in the Grants, not just land owned through the Wentworth grants.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes {{was created}} with {{the merger of}} Serbia, Montenegro and the South Slav-inhabited areas of Austria-Hungary on 1 December 1918, in the {{immediate}} aftermath of World War I. The Army of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was established at war's end to defend the new state. It was formed around the nucleus of the victorious Royal Serbian Army, as well as armed formations raised in regions formerly controlled by Austria-Hungary. Many former Austro-Hungarian officers and soldiers became members of the new army. From the beginning, much like other aspects of public life in the new kingdom, the army was dominated by ethnic Serbs, who saw it as a means <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> secure Serb political hegemony.|$|E

5|$|The {{lieutenant}} governor is elected {{on the same}} election ticket as the Governor in a statewide election held every four years, concurrent with United States presidential elections. Should a {{lieutenant governor}} die while in office, resign, or succeed to the governorship, the constitution specifies no mechanism <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> fill vacancies in the lieutenant governor's office. Historically, the position has generally remained vacant during such events. The last attempt to fill such a vacancy in 1887 led to the outbreak {{of violence in the}} state legislature known as the Black Day of the General Assembly. However, in recent years the Governor has appointed a Lieutenant Governor if a vacancy arises.|$|E
5|$|In March 1909, Riley was {{stricken}} {{a second}} time with Bell's palsy, and partial deafness, the symptoms only gradually eased {{over the course of}} the year. Riley was a difficult patient, and generally refused to take any medicine except the patent medicines he had sold in his earlier years; the medicines often worsened his conditions, but his doctors could not sway his opinion. On July 10, 1910 he suffered a stroke that paralyzed the right side of his body. Hoping for a quick recovery, his family kept the news from the press until September. Riley found the loss of use of his writing hand the worst part of the stroke, which served only to further depress him. With his health so poor, he decided to work on a legacy <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> be remembered in Indianapolis. In 1911 he donated land and funds to build a new library on Pennsylvania Avenue. By 1913, with the aid of a cane, Riley began to recover his ability to walk. His inability to write, however, nearly ended his production of poems. George Ade worked with him from 1910 through 1916 to write his last five poems and several short autobiographical sketches as Riley dictated. His publisher continued recycling old works into new books, which remained in high demand.|$|E
5|$|Parma {{was more}} than willing to help. The Electorate, {{strategically}} important to Spain, offered another land route <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> approach the rebellious northern Provinces of the Netherlands. Although the Spanish road from Spain's holdings on the Mediterranean shores led to its territories in what is today Belgium, it was a long, arduous march, complicated by the provisioning of troops and the potentially hostile populations of the territories through which it passed. An alternative route on the Rhine promised better access to the Habsburg Netherlands. Furthermore, the presence of a Calvinist electorate almost on the Dutch border could delay their efforts to bring the rebellious Dutch back to the Spanish rule and the Catholic confession. Philip II and his generals could be convinced to support Ernst's cause for such considerations. Indeed, the process of intervention had started earlier. In 1581, Philip's forces, paid for by papal gold, had taken Aachen, which Protestants had seized; by the mid–1580s, the Duke of Parma's forces, encouraged by the Wittelsbachs and the Catholics in Cologne, had secured garrisons throughout the northern territories of the Electorate. By 1590, these garrisons gave Spain access to the northern provinces and Philip felt comfortable enough with his military access to the provinces, and with their isolation from possible support by German Protestants, to direct more of his attention to France, and less to his problems with the Dutch.|$|E
