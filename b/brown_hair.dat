50|$|Developing {{parts of}} the plant bear an indumentum of long, <b>brown</b> <b>hairs.</b> However, most of these {{disappear}} during {{the normal course of}} development, and mature parts only have a sparse covering of short, <b>brown</b> <b>hairs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mature {{individuals}} have brown carapaces with short golden hairs (setae) {{with a slight}} purple sheen. Females have abdomens with long greyish <b>brown</b> <b>hairs</b> {{on the front of}} the upper (dorsal) surface and the sides; males have these longer hairs evenly distributed. Both sexes have legs and palps with short <b>brown</b> <b>hairs</b> with a pink sheen and long <b>brown</b> <b>hairs</b> with darker bases and a whitish apex.

5|$|Aerith was {{designed}} by Tetsuya Nomura, with influence from director and scenario writer Yoshinori Kitase and Hironobu Sakaguchi, whilst Yoshitaka Amano created conceptual artwork which also helped to influence her design. She has green eyes and long <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> tied in a braid with a pink ribbon. She wears a long pink dress, a bolero jacket, and brown hiking boots. The long dress {{was designed}} to appear ladylike and as a contrast to Tifa Lockhart's miniskirt. During development, Aerith {{was supposed to be}} Sephiroth's sister as both designs resembled each other, but they were made former lovers with Aerith remembering Sephiroth when meeting Cloud as both are ex-SOLDIERS. Late during development, Aerith's first love was changed to Zack Fair.|$|E

5|$|The Smiths {{saw the man}} {{at around}} 22:00 on Rua da Escola Primária, 500 yards (457 m) from the McCanns' apartment, {{walking away from the}} Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was {{carrying}} a girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair and pale skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5ft 7in–5ft 9in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short <b>brown</b> <b>hair,</b> wearing cream or beige trousers. He did not look like a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child. E-fits based on the Smiths testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on Crimewatch.|$|E
5|$|During the fall, elk grow a thicker coat of hair, {{which helps}} to {{insulate}} {{them during the}} winter. Males, females and calves of Siberian and North American elk all grow thin neck manes; female and young Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis do not. By early summer, the heavy winter coat has been shed, and elk are known to rub against trees and other objects to help remove hair from their bodies. All elk have small and clearly defined rump patches with short tails. They have different coloration based on the seasons and types of habitats, with gray or lighter coloration prevalent {{in the winter and}} a more reddish, darker coat in the summer. Subspecies living in arid climates tend to have lighter colored coats than do those living in forests. Most have lighter yellow-brown to orange-brown coats in contrast to dark <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> on the head, neck, and legs during the summer. Forest-adapted Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis have darker reddish-brown coats with less contrast between the body coat {{and the rest of the}} body during the summer months. Calves are born spotted, as is common with many deer species, and they lose their spots by the end of summer. Adult Manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spots on the back of their summer coats until they are older. This characteristic has also been observed in the forest-adapted European red deer.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} this mixing depend on the types (the alleles) of the gene. If the father has two copies of an allele for red hair, and the mother has two copies for <b>brown</b> <b>hair,</b> all their {{children}} get the two alleles that give different instructions, one for red hair and one for brown. The hair color of these children depends on how these alleles work together. If one allele dominates the instructions from another, {{it is called the}} dominant allele, and the allele that is overridden is called the recessive allele. In the case of a daughter with alleles for both red and <b>brown</b> <b>hair,</b> brown is dominant and she ends up with <b>brown</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{length of}} the Indiana bat's head to the body is from 4.1-4.9 centimeters. The animal weighs about 1/4 an ounce. These bats are very {{difficult}} to distinguish from other species, especially the more common little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), unless examined closely. The size of the feet, the {{length of the}} toe hairs, and the presence of a keel on the calcar are characteristics used to differentiate the Indiana bat from other bats. Indiana bats live an average of 5 to 9 years, but some have reached 12 years of age. It can have fur from black to chestnut with a light gray to cinnamon belly. Unlike other common bats with <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> and black lips, the Indiana bat has <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> and pink lips, which is helpful for identification.|$|E
25|$|Now {{imagine that}} this woman grows up and has {{children}} with a brown-haired man who also has a Bb genotype. Her eggs will be a mixture of two types, one sort containing the B allele, and one sort the b allele. Similarly, her partner will produce a mix of two types of sperm containing {{one or the other}} of these two alleles. When the transmitted genes are joined up in their offspring, these children have a chance of getting either brown or red hair, since they could get a genotype of BB = <b>brown</b> <b>hair,</b> Bb = <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> or bb = red hair. In this generation, there is therefore a chance of the recessive allele showing itself in the phenotype of the children—some of them may have red hair like their grandfather.|$|E
