50|$|Due to {{the large}} ear size, English lops are {{slightly}} more vulnerable {{to a number of}} health problems, particularly ear infections, and it is advised that the ears should be checked periodically, especially for excess wax that can be accumulated on their deep ear canals and cleaned when appropriate. Ear blemishes can be kept to a minimum by keeping the toenails clipped, which can prevent injuries arising from the rabbit treading on its ears. The large surface area of its ears and body, and the absence of a dense undercoat can result in greater heat loss, which can become a problem for outdoor rabbits in cold climates and winters, and in the onset of these conditions, special measures should be taken to insulate the hutch, such as the provision of increased bedding and hay, and draft excluders. In freezing conditions, an English Lop should never be given a water dish or crock, since wet ears will freeze. Accordingly, English Lops do better in heat than many other rabbit breeds, due to the cooling factor of their large ears. However, any temperature over 85 degrees is considered dangerously high and care should be made to ensure the rabbit has plenty of shade, fresh water, or cool surface to lie against. An English Lop can live in either a solid bottom hutch or cage with bedding provided, or an adequetly spaced wire <b>bottom</b> <b>cage</b> provided they have a thick resting board/pad to prevent injury to hocks.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} combinations of tagging and release methods was examined on the survival, moulting, growth increment and recapture rates of slipper lobsters Thenus spp. on the Queensland (Australia) east coast using generalised linear modelling methods. Laboratory experiments indicated that while tagging is unlikely to significantly affect the survival rate or growth increments of lobsters, {{it is likely to}} lower the incidence of moulting. In the field, recapture rates of tagged lobsters increased markedly by applying an antibiotic/antifungal ointment to the tag wound and by minimising the length of time lobsters were held on board prior to release. Recapture rates for Thenus orientalis declined by about 0. 5 % for every hour lobsters were held on board prior to release, even though they were kept in aerated seawater. About twice as many male T. orientalis were recaptured compared to females. Reasons for this may be related to size differences between the sexes and how the fishers valued the rewards for different size classes. The size of the T-bar anchor tag affected recapture rates of Thenus indicus; recapture rates of lobsters tagged with small tags were about 33 % higher than those with large tags. Two different methods of release were also compared; surface release and <b>bottom</b> <b>cage</b> release. Recapture rates of large lobsters and those that were held on board for several hours prior to release were improved by using the <b>bottom</b> <b>cage</b> method. However, under some conditions, the cage may lower recapture rates relative to the surface release method, possibly because of increased stress and trauma from crowding in the cage. For both species, growth increments of recaptured lobsters increased with the period at liberty and declined with increasing lobster size. Females had significantly larger growth increments than males...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} {{the establishment of}} an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) system in the tropical open waters of southern Cebu, Philippines using a combination of locally available species, namely donkey’s ear abalone (Haliotis asinina) as fed species and seaweeds (Gracilaria heteroclada and Eucheuma denticulatum) as inorganic extractive species. The culture of Caulerpa lentillifera as a biofilter did not work in the open sea cultivation system using baskets. Monthly measurements of shell length, width and body weight of the cultured abalones, together with in situ measurements of physicochemical parameters to assess any changes in water quality, mainly nitrate, nitrite, ammonia and phosphate, were conducted over a year period from February 2013 to January 2014 in three designated stations (Abalone, Seaweed and Control Stations) at three different depths (surface, middle and <b>bottom).</b> <b>Cage</b> culture of abalone side by side with seaweeds in the open sea did not result in any significant water quality disturbance in the area—at least not in the current volume of caged abalones being used. Of the four inorganic compounds monitored in the field, nitrate and ammonia in the Seaweed Station were shown to have relatively lower year-round average values when compared with the Abalone Station, although in the case of nitrate, it was higher in the Control Station compared with the abalone and Seaweed Stations. Although this difference was not significant, it shows the red seaweeds, G. heteroclada and E. denticulatum, to be functioning as a natural filter for these two nutrients. In contrast, nitrite, and phosphate concentrations were not reduced indicating that the seaweeds were not effective biofilter for these two nutrients. The two-month old hatchery-bred donkey’s ear abalones can grow to a size of 53. 8 × 28. 2 mm (L×W) and body weight of 37. 8 g after a period of 12 months. Any expansion of the farm into a much larger commercial-scale farm will have to be complimented with seaweeds stocked around it if only to mitigate possible build-up of excess inorganic wastes—to serve as both a natural filter and as a source of natural feed. The potential use of an organic extractive species has to be further studied under farm condition to achieve its full potential as an IMTA species...|$|E

Copper {{is an essential}} dietary trace metal responsible for the functioning of at least 12 mammalian enzymes. Despite current increases in cases of copper deficient humans, a sensitive, reliable, and easily evaluated copper deficiency biomarker {{has yet to be}} identified. Multiple studies using rodent models were used to evaluate currently accepted blood biomarker proteins through Western blotting and activity assays. In the first study, male postweanling Sprague Dawley rats were fed copper deficient (CuD) or copper adequate (CuA) diets and deionized water and sampled after one, two, and four weeks. A group fed an iron deficient diet (FeD) was also included and sampled after two weeks. Lastly, after the four weeks a repletion study was performed for two weeks with samples taken after a total of six weeks of study. Superoxide dismutase (Sod 1) and ceruloplasmin (Cp) were influenced by CuD and FeD diets, while the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) and the ratio of CCS/Sod 1 were influenced only by CuD diet and after just one week. Blood cuproenzymes from CuD repleted rats normalized after two weeks on the CuA diet. Next, for two weeks male postweanling Sprague Dawley rats were fed CuA or CuD diets and compared with a group of marginally copper deficient (CuM) rats whose water was copper supplemented. Although differences between the CuD and CuM groups versus the CuA groups were identified, only CCS showed statistically different results between all groups, allowing for the identification of marginally copper deficient individuals. Further, there was high negative statistical correlation between liver copper and erythrocyte CCS. For all mouse trials, Swiss Webster mice were fed either CuD or CuA diets for five weeks. In one experiment, postweanling mice were housed in solid <b>bottom</b> <b>cages</b> and thus had access to their feces. In another postweanling mice were housed in stainless steal mesh <b>bottom</b> <b>cages.</b> CuD mice from solid <b>bottom</b> <b>cages</b> were found to be less deficient, likely due to coprophagia. These animals showed no reduction in plasma Cp or Sod 1 expression, but did have higher CCS expression. Lastly, adult Swiss Webster mice were house in stainless steal mesh <b>bottom</b> <b>cages</b> and then evaluated for copper deficiency. CuD adult mice had no changes in Cp activity, liver copper levels, hemoglobin quantities, or Sod 1 and Cp expression, but they did have a significantly elevated expression of CCS. These rodent model results indicated that CCS maybe an excellent biomarker for marginal copper deficiency in human diagnosis due to CCS’s reliability and sensitivity to variable copper status...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} a 5 -month experiment at Turpialito in the Golfo de Cariaco, Venezuela, {{to examine whether}} the previously reported more rapid growth of scallop Euvola ziczac in bottom compared to suspended culture {{can be attributed to}} more abundant or higher quality food resources near the sediment/water interface. The various body components (shell, muscle, digestive gland, gonad and remaining tissues) increased in size at a much greater rate for scallops maintained on the bottom, in partly buried cages at 5 m in depth, than in cages suspended at the same depth in the water column. Furthermore, survival was greater on the bottom. Food abundance and quality were examined by analyzing the seston collected in sediment traps at the sediment/water interface {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>cages</b> and next to the suspended cages. Phytoplankton abundance (chlorophyll a) and the proportion of various fatty acids in the lipid fraction of the seston were similar on the bottom and in suspension. However, sestonic protein, lipid and carbohydrate levels, and the estimated energetic content of the seston, were higher on the bottom than in suspension, and probably contributed to the greater growth on the bottom. As the increase in the energetic content of the seston on the bottom compared to in suspension was less than the increase in growth (biomass) on the bottom compared to in suspension, and the evidence showed in previous studies above the negative influence of fouling and wave action in suspended culture, we conclude that the more rapid growth of Euvola ziczac in bottom than suspended culture is principally due to stress relative to suspended culture system.

40|$|Introduction Crohn’s {{disease and}} {{ulcerative}} colitis {{are the main}} clinical phenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Both forms of IBD can increase the incidence of gastrointestinal and colon cancers, and both ones are associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. In addition, they can begin early in life and persist for long periods. The pathogenesis of IBD is complex and multifactorial. Differential alteration of Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression in inflammatory bowel disease was first described 15 years ago. Studies {{have led to the}} current concept that TLRs represent key mediators of innate host defense in the intestine, and they are involved in mucosa maintaining as well as commensal homeostasis. Recent findings in diverse murine models of ileitis have helped to reveal the importance of TLR dysfunction mechanisms in IBD pathogenesis. The aim of research The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of acute ileitis on expression intensity of TLR- 2 in lymphocytes of small intestine. Materials and methods Male Wistar rats with weight 200 – 250 g were housed in standard wire-mesh <b>bottom</b> <b>cages</b> at constant temperature of 25 °C and 12 / 12 h light/dark cycles. The rats were given water and standard laboratory diet with no restriction prior to indomethacin injection. A total number of 20 rats were examined, including control group (n = 10). For induction of acute ileitis, rats received one subcutaneous dose of indomethacin (Sigma, 15 mg/kg). Tissue was examined on the fifth day. For histological examination sections were colored with haematoxylin and eosin. The TLR- 2 +cells were determined using a direct immunofluorescence technique with using monoclonal rat anti-TLR- 2 antibodies. Images were taken by using a fluorescence microscope PrimoStar (ZEISS, Germany) with a computer-assisted video system AxioCam 5 c (ZEISS, Germany) including the NIH-Image software (NIH Image version 1 · 46). All statistical analyses were performed using EXCEL MS Office 2010 (Microsoft Corp., USA), STATISTICA 6. 0 (Stat-Soft, 2001) software. Results are expressed as mean values ± SEM. Differences were considered statistically significant if the p value was < 0. 05. Results In our study the significant increase of TLR- 2 + lymphocytes during the acute intestinal inflammation over a short time-course suggests that TLR- 2 + lymphocytes are involved in the inflammatory process and therefore it might be one of the factors that support the progression of IBD.

Growth, in terms of shell width, dry tissue weight and condition index {{of the same size}} class, did not show significant differences (P > 0. 05) between the transplanted populations at the open sea bottom and in enclosure cages. Fastest growth was noted for the small-size class during the initial 12 -month period, with a net increase in maximum shell width of 50 - 60 mm (100 - 120 mm shell length). Thereafter, growth tended to slow down and all growth parameters became similar for all the three size classes. In comparison of the small-size fan mussels between the <b>bottom</b> (open and <b>caged)</b> transplants and that on the suspended rafts, a better growth result was registered in the suspended raft population possibly due to a faster induced flow and availability of food in the water column. Mortality of transplanted P. bicolor was the highest at open sea bottom, and predominantly caused by predation by fish and crabs. Highest mortality was also noted in the small-size class as the larger fan mussels were less vulnerable to predation than the small juvenile. The number of transplanted P, bicolor at open sea bottom fell to the same natural density within the fast 12 months of the study and stabilized afterwards, suggesting that the natural population of P. bicolor was controlled by its predators.
