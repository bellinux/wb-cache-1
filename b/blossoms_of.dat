25|$|Like most warblers, grey-breasted prinias are insectivorous. They feeds {{mainly on}} insects like ants, small beetles, {{caterpillars}} which are found among twigs and foliage of small trees. They also feeds on nectar from <b>blossoms</b> <b>of</b> trees like Erythrina and Bombax and during summer their forehead is sometimes sprinkled with pollen giving them an orange or yellowish head {{that can lead}} to mistaken identification.|$|E
25|$|In a {{competitive}} market the title of miscellanies was increasingly important. Without a specific selling-point, more generic complications would use catch-all titles as a tactic to familiarise themselves {{with a wide range}} of audiences and to appeal to a breadth of tastes. Titles could evoke the ornamental (The Bouquet: or <b>Blossoms</b> <b>of</b> Fancy, 1796), the medicinal (The Merry Companion: or, A Cure for the Spleen, 1730), the festive or feast (A Banquet of the Muses: or The Miscellany of Miscellanies, 1746), the curious (A Museum for Young Gentlemen and Ladies, 1751–82), and the curatorial (The Foundling Hospital for Wit, 1743–64).|$|E

25|$|Flowers and blossoms: Undoubtedly {{the largest}} and most common source of perfume aromatics. Includes the flowers of several species of rose and jasmine, as well as osmanthus, plumeria, mimosa, tuberose, narcissus, scented geranium, cassie, {{ambrette}} as well as the <b>blossoms</b> <b>of</b> citrus and ylang-ylang trees. Although not traditionally thought of as a flower, the unopened flower buds of the clove are also commonly used. Most orchid flowers are not commercially used to produce essential oils or absolutes, except in the case of vanilla, an orchid, which must be pollinated first and made into seed pods before use in perfumery.|$|E
25|$|On 20 December, Jong-il's embalmed body lay {{in state}} in a glass coffin at the Kumsusan Memorial Palace, where his father Kim Il-sung is also interred, for an 11-day {{mourning}} period prior to the funeral. Like his father, Kim's body was covered in a red flag and surrounded by <b>blossoms</b> <b>of</b> his namesake flowers, red kimjongilia. It is expected that the body will be placed next to his father's bier following the funeral and mourning period. As solemn music played, Kim Jong-un entered the hall to view his father's bier, surrounded by military honour guards. He observed a moment of solemn silence, then circled the bier, followed by other officials.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{primitive}} matriarchal religions, which {{derived from the}} work of the Swiss lawyer Johann Jakob Bachofen, was popular in Gardner's day, both among academics (e.g., Erich Neumann, Margaret Murray) and amateurs (e.g. Robert Graves). Later scholars (e.g. Carl Jung and Marija Gimbutas) continued research in this area, and later still Joseph Campbell, Ashley Montagu and others became admirers of Gimbutas' theories of matriarchies in ancient Europe. Matriarchal interpretations of the archaeological record and the criticism of such work continue to be matters of academic debate. Some academics carry on research in this area (such as the 2003 World Congress on Matriarchal Studies). Critics argue that such matriarchal societies never actually existed and are an invention of researchers such as Margaret Murray. This is disputed by documentaries such as <b>Blossoms</b> <b>of</b> Fire (about contemporary Zapotec society).|$|E
