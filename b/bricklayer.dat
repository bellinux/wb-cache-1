40|$|Background: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) due to occupational exposures remains an important {{public health problem}} taking significant toll on the global burden of the disease. Aim: In order to assess chronic prevalence and characteristics of COPD in bricklaying we performed a cross-sectional study including 47 never-smoking male <b>bricklayers</b> (aged 34 to 57 years) and {{an equal number of}} never-smoking male office workers studied as a control. Methods: Evaluation of examined subjects consisted of completion of a questionnaire, baseline spirometry, and bronchodilator reversibility testing. Results: We found higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms in <b>bricklayers</b> with significant difference for cough and phlegm. Majority of the chronic respiratory symptoms in <b>bricklayers</b> were work-related. The mean values of all measured spirometric parameters in <b>bricklayers</b> were significantly lower than in office workers. The prevalence of COPD was significantly higher in <b>bricklayers</b> than in office workers (14. 9 % vs. 4. 3 %, P = 0. 034). COPD in both examined groups was close related to age over 45 years, while in <b>bricklayers</b> significant association was registered for duration of occupational exposure longer than 20 years and work-related respiratory symptoms. Conclusion: Our findings support data about relationship between occupational exposure to inorganic dust and fumes in construction workers and persistent airflow limitation...|$|R
50|$|In May 1929 Gregg {{signed with}} Holley Carburetor F.C., of Detroit, Michigan, U.S.A., and in September that year moved West {{to sign with}} the Carpenters S.C. in Chicago, Illinois.

5|$|Fleming and {{the judge}} {{who presided over the}} trial each spoke with her; both argued that they did not deserve blame for the lynching. A schoolteacher who had known Washington told Freeman that Washington was illiterate, and that all {{attempts}} to teach him to read had been futile. Freeman concluded that white residents were generally supportive of Washington's lynching, although many disliked that his body was mutilated. She determined that the mob was led by a <b>bricklayer,</b> a saloonkeeper, and several employees of an ice company. The NAACP did not publicly identify them. Freeman concluded that Washington killed Fryer, and that he was motivated by her domineering attitude towards him.|$|E

5|$|William Wilde was Ireland's leading oto-ophthalmologic (ear and eye) {{surgeon and}} was knighted in 1864 for his {{services}} as medical adviser and assistant commissioner to the censuses of Ireland. He also wrote books about Irish archaeology and peasant folklore. A renowned philanthropist, his dispensary {{for the care of}} the city's poor at the rear of Trinity College, Dublin, was the forerunner of the Dublin Eye and Ear Hospital, now located at Adelaide Road.

5|$|In 1666 as the Great Fire of London {{swept through}} the city, Derby Place, the College's home since 1555, was {{completely}} gutted and destroyed. Fortunately the College's library was saved, and at first was stored in the Palace of Whitehall, then later moved to the Palace of Westminster, where a temporary office was opened in an apartment called the Queen's court. An announcement was also made in the London Gazette to draw public notice to the situation. Due to a shortage of funds, the planned rebuilding of a new College was delayed until 1670. It was then that Francis Sandford, the Rouge Dragon Pursuivant and Morris Emmett, the King's <b>bricklayer,</b> were together able to design and begin {{construction of a new}} structure on the old site. The costs of the rebuilding was financed in stages, and the structure was erected slowly in parts.The heralds contributed significantly out of their own pockets; at the same time, they also sought subscriptions among the nobility, with the names of contributors recorded into a series of splendid manuscripts known as the Benefactors Books.|$|E

His father soon built him a kart from discarded parts and at the age of six Schumacher won his first club championship. To support his son's racing, Rolf Schumacher took on a second job renting and repairing karts, while his wife worked at the track's canteen.

5|$|The Limehouse Cut {{would give}} {{direct access to}} the River Thames, {{avoiding}} the tidal Bow Creek. It was expected to open in July 1770, but some of the brickwork collapsed, and had to be repaired before the cut opened on 17 September 1770. It closed again briefly in December, when a bridge collapsed into it, and it was soon decided that it was too narrow, and so was widened to allow barges to pass each other along its complete length. This work was finished on 1 September 1777. The contract for the Hackney Cut was given to Jeremiah Ilsley on 18 January 1768, and a <b>bricklayer</b> called Henry Holland was asked to build two locks on the cut on 23 April 1768. A millwright from Bromley called Mr Cooper was given the job of building Bromley Lock (close to Bow tidal gates). Work progressed quickly, and the cut was opened for traffic on 7 August 1769.|$|E
