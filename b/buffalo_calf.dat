40|$|A bovine {{strain of}} myxovirus parainfluenza- 3 (MP 3) virus, {{designated}} S virus, was isolated from lung tissue collected from cattle with respiratory illness in 1963. The virus agglutinates mammalian and avian erythrocytes, and {{is sensitive to}} ether, sodium desoxycholate and trypsin. It grows in primary <b>calf</b> kidney, <b>buffalo</b> kidney, dog kidney, camel kidney and MS cell cultures. The S virus forms well-defined plaques in <b>buffalo</b> and <b>calf</b> kidney cells on the 5 th or 6 th day after inoculation. Examination of cell cultures following inoculation with S virus revealed giant cell formation, and introcytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions. At 37 °C the virus titer dropped from 1010. 4 to 102. 6 in 3 days. Virus was completely inactivated at 56 °C within 15 minutes. Growth-curve studies in tissue culture monolayer cells revealed a latent period of 10 hours. The intracellular virus titer was slightly {{lower than that of}} extracellular virus. The isolate was identified as MP 3 virus by serum neutralization and hemagglutination-inhibition tests. Antibodies (HI) to S virus were shown to be present in a significant proportion of Egyptian cattle. The epidemiological significance of MP 3 (bovine strain) virus in U. A. R. is discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the transmission of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) from experimentally infected Indian buffalo to in-contact naïve and vaccinated cattle and buffalo. In each of six rooms, two donor buffalo that had been inoculated with FMDV were housed for five days with four recipient animals, comprising one vaccinated <b>buffalo,</b> one vaccinated <b>calf,</b> one unvaccinated <b>buffalo</b> and one unvaccinated calf. Vaccination was carried out with current Indian vaccine strain (O/IND/R 2 / 75) and challenged on 28 days post-vaccination with an antigenically similar strain (O/HAS/ 34 / 05). All 12 donor buffalo and the six unvaccinated cattle and six unvaccinated calves developed clinical signs of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). In contrast, all six vaccinated cattle (100 %) and four out of six vaccinated buffalo (66. 6 %) were protected from disease but all became infected with FMDV. This confirms that buffalo {{have the potential to}} spread FMD by direct contact and that vaccination can block this spread. The numbers of animals in the study were too small to determine if the differences in clinical protection afforded by vaccination of cattle and buffalo are significant and warrant a different dose regime...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to validate an immunofluorimetric method to measure free triiodothyronine (fT 3) and free thyroxine (fT 4) concentrations in the serum of buffalo and to develop a better understanding of thyroid metabolism in buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) of different ages and reproductive statuses. Free triiodothyronine and fT 4 were determined in sera from 4 groups of 10 animals, each representing 5 – 10 -year-old lactating buffalo, 2 – 3 -year-old first calf heifers, 1 – 1. 5 -year-old virgin heifers, and 5 – 10 -year-old dry buffalo. The average sensitivity of the immunofluorimetric assay was 5. 9 pmol/l for fT 3 and 14. 7 pmol/l for fT 4. Intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation were 5. 6 % and 5. 1 % for fT 3 and 1. 5 % and 4. 3 % for fT 4, respectively. Virgin heifers had higher average values for fT 3 and fT 4, while lactating buffalo had the lowest average values. Dry <b>buffalo</b> and first <b>calf</b> heifers had intermediate fT 3 and fT 4 values. The findings of this study suggested that lactating buffalo were in a state of low thyroid activity, while virgin heifers had increased thyroid activity...|$|R

25|$|There {{are various}} types of stories among many {{indigenous}} communities.

These stories may be used for coming of age themes, core values, morality, literacy and history. Very often, the stories are used to instruct and teach children about cultural values and lessons. The meaning within the stories is not always explicit, and children are expected to make their own meaning of the stories. In the Lakota Tribe of North America, for example, young girls are often told the story of the White <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Calf</b> Woman, who is a spiritual figure that protects young girls from the whims of men. In the Odawa Tribe, young boys are often told {{the story of a young}} man who never took care of his body, and as a result, his feet fail to run when he tries to escape predators.

I don't think the calf was much hurt. But those blood-thirsty devils will return, and like as not get the calf. That's the worst of cattle raising. Now, take the buffalo. Do you suppose those wolves could have gotten a <b>buffalo</b> <b>calf</b> out from under the mother? Never. Neither could a whole band of wolves. Buffalo stick close together, and the little ones do not stray. When danger threatens, the herd closes in and faces it and fights.

6000|$|By {{this time}} I knew not whither I was going, and turned {{aside from a}} broad, paved road (it was the Appian Way) into the Via Latina, which I {{supposed}} would lead {{to one of the}} city gates. It was a lonely path: on my right hand extensive piles of ruin, in strange shapes or shapelessness, built of the broad and thin old Roman bricks, such as may be traced everywhere, when the stucco has fallen away from a modern Roman house; for I imagine {{there has not been a}} new brick made here for a thousand years. On my left, I think, was a high wall, and before me, grazing in the road [...] . [the <b>buffalo</b> <b>calf</b> of the Marble Faun.--ED.]. The road went boldly on, with a well-worn track up to the very walls of the city; but there it abruptly terminated at an ancient, closed-up gateway. From a notice posted against a door, which appeared to be the entrance to the ruins on my left, I found that these were the remains of Columbaria, where the dead used to be put away in pigeon-holes. Reaching the paved road again, I kept on my course, passing the tomb of the Scipios, and soon came to the gate of San Sebastiano, through which I entered the Campagna. Indeed, the scene around was so rural, that I had fancied myself already beyond the walls. As the afternoon was getting advanced, I did not proceed any farther towards the blue hills which I saw in the distance, but turned to my left, following a road that runs round the exterior of the city wall. It was very dreary and solitary,-- not a house on the whole track, with the broad and shaggy Campagna on one side, and the high, bare wall, looking down over my head, on the other. It is not, any more than the other objects of the scene, a very picturesque wall, but is little more than a brick garden-fence seen through a magnifying-glass, with now and then a tower, however, and frequent buttresses, to keep its height of fifty feet from toppling over. The top was ragged, and fringed with a few weeds; there had been embrasures for guns and eyelet-holes for musketry, but these were plastered up with brick or stone. I passed one or two walled-up gateways (by the by, the Parts, Latina was the gate through which Belisarius first entered Rome), and one of these had two high, round towers, and looked more Gothic and venerable with antique strength than any other portion of the wall. Immediately after this I came to the gate of San Giovanni, just within which is the Basilica of St. John Lateran, and there I was glad to rest myself upon a bench before proceeding homeward.|$|E
