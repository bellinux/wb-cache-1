They do not have {{external}} ears; the eardrums (tympanic membranes) are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular area just behind the eye. The size and distance apart of the eardrums is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog calls. In some species such as the bullfrog, the size of the tympanum indicates the sex of the frog; males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females, the eyes and tympani are much the same size. A noise causes the tympanum to vibrate and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear. The middle ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation. In the inner ear, the auditory hair cells are arranged in two areas of the cochlea, the basilar papilla and the amphibian papilla. The former detects high frequencies and the latter low frequencies. Because the cochlea is short, frogs use electrical tuning to extend their range of audible frequencies and help discriminate different sounds. This arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding calls of their conspecifics. In some species that inhabit arid regions, the sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse them from a dormant state. A frog may be startled by an unexpected noise <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> usually take any action until it has located the source of the sound by sight.|$|E

It also covers three trials of IVF in primary infertility cases. Some health insurance companies cover the diagnosis and the treatment of infertility for those with government health insurance, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> cover any of the assisted reproductive techniques. In private sector, there are many centers offering private treatment for infertility including the assisted reproductive techniques.|$|E

25|$|Concrete {{reinforced}} with fibers (which are usually steel, glass, or plastic fibers) is {{less expensive than}} hand-tied rebar, while still increasing the tensile strength many times. The shape, dimension, and length of the fiber are important. A thin and short fiber, for example short, hair-shaped glass fiber, is only effective during the first hours after pouring the concrete (its function is to reduce cracking while the concrete is stiffening), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> increase the concrete tensile strength. A normal-size fiber for European shotcrete (1mm diameter, 45mm lengthâ€”steel or plastic) will increase the concrete's tensile strength.|$|E
25|$|Orion {{is located}} on the {{celestial}} equator, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> always be so located due to the effects of precession of the Earth's axis. Orion lies well south of the ecliptic, and it only happens to lie on the celestial equator because the point on the ecliptic that corresponds to the June solstice is close to the border of Gemini and Taurus, to the north of Orion. Precession will eventually carry Orion further south, and by AD 14000 Orion will be far enough south that it will become invisible from the latitude of Great Britain.|$|E

Most bowhunters, it responded, will be using tree stands on the perimeter and will only need to enter the site briefly to retrieve any kills. It will be administered under a special fee permit system.

25|$|The {{problem that}} is slowing down {{high-speed}} rail in Sweden is the present signaling system (ATC), which does not allow speeds over 200km/h. It can be upgraded, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be done since it shall {{be replaced by the}} European signaling system ERTMS level 2 on major lines in the near future, allowing high speeds up to 250km/h. ERTMS level 2 has been installed and is being tried out on Botniabanan, and that railway allows 250km/h, although no passenger train goes above 200 for now. The train set X55-Regina has been delivered to the rail company SJ with the max speed of 200km/h but with the option to upgrade the EMU to 250km/h when possible. Also the mix with freight trains slow down the practical speed.|$|E

For the 2009 season, 4,525 permanent bleacher seats were constructed, which allowed the stadium {{to become the first}} football stadium in Texas capable of seating in excess of 100,000 people and brought the stadium to its current seating capacity. In May 2013, Regents for the University of Texas system approved a $62 million stadium improvement project.

25|$|On {{the other}} side of the house, Pam leads Vic into the garden toward a pond with a statue of Ellen in it. She {{suddenly}} disappears. When Vic looks down into the pond, he sees what he believes to be Pam's dead body. He attempts to pull her out of the water, but the body vanishes and he is left clutching only her nightgown. He panics and runs back toward the house. Looking back, he sees the statue come to life and has a heart attack. Vic tries to draw the attention of Emery (who is inside the house), but Emery again believes this to be an apparition and refuses to open the window. Nick arrives and tries to open the window, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> open and the glass cannot be broken. Vic collapses and dies in full view of Emery and Nick. Out in the woods, Mrs. Waterman is stopped and knocked unconscious by the ghost of Kevin Bollinger.|$|E
25|$|A {{thermodynamic}} process {{might be}} initiated by a thermodynamic {{operation in the}} surroundings, that mechanically increases in the controlled volume of the vapor. Some mechanical work will be done within the surroundings by the vapor, but also some of the parent liquid will evaporate and enter the vapor collection which is the contiguous surrounding subsystem. Some internal energy will accompany the vapor that leaves the system, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> make sense to try to uniquely identify part of that internal energy as heat {{and part of it}} as work. Consequently, the energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of matter between the system and its surrounding subsystem cannot be uniquely split into heat and work transfers to or from the open system. The component of total energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of vapor into the surrounding subsystem is customarily called 'latent heat of evaporation', but this use of the word heat is a quirk of customary historical language, not in strict compliance with the thermodynamic definition of transfer of energy as heat. In this example, kinetic energy of bulk flow and potential energy with respect to long-range external forces such as gravity are both considered to be zero. The first law of thermodynamics refers to the change of internal energy of the open system, between its initial and final states of internal equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|Nitric acid, after {{distillation}} {{to increase}} the acid strength, is capable of dissolving the silver <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> (by itself) dissolve the gold. However, nitric acid {{is not able to}} (fully) extract silver and other impurities from an alloy with a high content of gold. Therefore, one part of scrap gold was typically alloyed with three parts of copper (quartering) before parting with nitric acid. Another method uses Sterling silver instead of copper. One part pure gold is alloyed with three parts Sterling silver (inquarting). The resulting six karat (6K) gold can then be parted with dilute nitric acid (one part 68-70% nitric acid to one part DISTILLED water). With the karat gold this low (6K), and over medium high heat, the dilute nitric acid will dissolve the Sterling silver (and other base metals in the karat gold) starting on the outside surface of the 6K gold alloy, working its way into the gold alloy, forming a honeycomb structure as it works its way into the metals. Since nitric acid will not dissolve gold, nearly pure gold (very close to 99.5% pure) will be left behind after the reaction is complete. After removing the solid gold other elements like silver and copper may be extracted from the liquid. To get the gold to a very high level of purity (999 fine gold) it is sometimes processed further with aqua regia to effectively remove all the impurities.|$|E

25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E

The former has been preferred by the Rail Administration, while the latterâ€”which would cost NOK 1billion moreâ€”has been preferred by the municipality. There are no intermediate commuter stations between SkÃ¸yen and Lysaker, so there is little regularity or speed potential to gain from the construction, since the Oslo Tunnel from SkÃ¸yen to Oslo Central Station will still remain a bottleneck with only two tracks.
