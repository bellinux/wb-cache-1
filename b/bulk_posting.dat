30|$|With the {{development}} of nanomaterial-based nanodevices, it became inevitable to develop cost-effective and simple nanofabrication technologies enabling the formation of nanomaterial assembly in a controllable manner. Herein, we present suspended monolithic carbon single nanowires and nanomeshes bridging two <b>bulk</b> carbon <b>posts,</b> fabricated in a designed manner using two successive UV exposure steps and a single pyrolysis step. The pyrolysis step is accompanied with a significant volume reduction, resulting in the shrinkage of micro-sized photoresist structures into nanoscale carbon structures. Even with the significant elongation of the suspended carbon nanowire induced by the volume reduction of the <b>bulk</b> carbon <b>posts,</b> the resultant tensional stress along the nanowire is not significant but grows along the wire thickness; this tensional stress gradient and the bent supports of the bridge-like carbon nanowire enhance structural robustness and alleviate the stiction problem that suspended nanostructures frequently experience. The feasibility of the suspended carbon nanostructures as a sensor platform was demonstrated by testing its electrochemical behavior, conductivity-temperature relationship, and hydrogen gas sensing capability.|$|R

The present study is to investigate the effect of using different covering flux compositions on mould-metal reaction during in-situ melting of AZ 91 D magnesium alloy. In this study the alloy {{in the form of}} granules was charged into a ceramic shell mould and heated up under argon atmosphere and the covering fluxes to different temperatures until it was melted and filled the mould at the possible lowest temperature. Thermal analysis was used to explore the melting behavior of the granules during using in-situ melting technique. Results showed that employing covering flux is necessary to approach to a lower temperature for melting. In addition, it diminished the mould metal reaction which led to a higher quality casting surface. Moreover, the granules showed the characteristic temperatures similar to the <b>bulk</b> material melting. <b>Post</b> publication note (26 July 2012) : The order of the authors has been updated and an affiliation has been added...|$|R

Several bound and free exciton transitions along with their first excited states have been observed at low temperatures, with the main neutral-donor-bound exciton peak at 3. 3605 eV having a linewidth of 0. 7 meV and dominating the PL spectrum at 10 K. This bound exciton transition was visible only below 150 K, whereas the A-free exciton transition at 3. 3771 eV persisted up to room temperature. A-free exciton binding energy of 60 meV is obtained from {{the position of the}} excited states of the free excitons. Additional intrinsic and extrinsic fine structures such as polariton, two-electron satellites, donor-acceptor pair transitions, and longitudinal optical-phonon replicas have also been observed and investigated in detail. Time-resolved PL measurements at room temperature reveal a biexponential decay behavior with typical decay constants of similar to 170 and similar to 864 ps for the as-grown sample.

ZR and ZL GaAs boules had background impurity levels and deep donor EL 2 concentrations near or below detectable limits. The crystal mosaic of the material at locations near the seed end was slightly superior to commercial liquid encapsulated Czochralski (LEC) material, and nearly equivalent to commercial vertical gradient freeze (VGF) material. The crystal mosaic in ZL material degraded towards the tail end. The homogeneity of the electrical properties for the ZL and ZR VZM material was inferior compared to commercially available <b>bulk</b> GaAs material. <b>Post</b> growth annealing may help to homogenize some electrical properties of the material. The charge collection efficiency of the ZR GaAs detectors was only 30 % maximum, and only 25 % maximum for the ZL GaAs detectors. Resulting gamma ray spectra was poor from detectors fabricated with the ZL or ZR VZM material. Detectors fabricated from material that was both ZR and ZL did not demonstrate gamma ray resolution, and operated mainly as counters. The poor spectroscopic performance is presently attributed to the inhomogeneity of the electrical properties of the ZR and ZL GaAs materials.

Higher dietary SPC inclusion was combined with increased supplementation of methionine, lysine, threonine and phosphorus. The experiment was carried out for 177 days. On day 92 salmon in each tank were <b>bulk</b> weighed. <b>Post</b> weighing eighty salmon from each tank were redistributed in two sets of 12 tanks. Salmon from {{the first set of}} tanks were vaccinated, while the second group was injected with phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Salmon were sampled on day 92 (pre-vaccination), day 94 (2 days post vaccination [dpv]/PBS injection [dpPBSinj]) and day 154 (62 dpv/dpPBSinj) of the trial for the assessment of their immune responses, prior to the performance of salmon bulk weights for each tank. On day 154, fish from each tank were again bulk weighed and then seventeen salmon per tank were redistributed in two sets of twelve tanks and intra-peritoneally infected with Aeromonas salmonicida. At Day 154, SPC 80 demonstrated lower performance (weight gain, specific growth rate and thermal growth coefficient and feed conversion ratio) compared to SPC 35 salmon. Reduced classical and total complement activities for salmon fed diets with over 58 % of protein from SPC, were demonstrated prior to vaccination. Reduced alternative complement activity was detected for both SPC 58 and SPC 80 salmon at 2 dpv and for the SPC 80 group at 62 dpv. Total and classical complement activities demonstrated no differences among the dietary groups after vaccination. Numerical increases in classical complement activity were apparent upon increased dietary SPC levels. Increased phagocytic activity (% phagocytosis and phagocytic index) was exhibited for the SPC 58 group compared to SPC 35 salmon at 62 dpPBSinj. No differences in serum lysozyme activity, total IgM, specific antibodies, protein, glucose and HKM respiratory burst were detected among the dietary groups at any timepoint or state.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{applicability}} of ground penetrating radar (GPR) as a technique for determining the thickness and internal structure of four peat deposits on Terceira Island (Azores archipelago, mid-Atlantic region). The peatlands studied are all Sphagnum mires located above 500 m a. s. l., but they differ hydrogenetically and in their degree of naturalness. Radargrams for all four bogs, obtained using both 100 MHz and 500 MHz GPR antennae, are presented and compared. The radargram data were validated against peat characteristics (<b>bulk</b> density, von <b>Post</b> H, US method) obtained by direct sampling (‚Äòopen cores‚Äô) across the whole peat profile at each site. A scheme of ‚Äòsoft scoring‚Äô for degree of naturalness (DN) of the peatland was developed and used as an additional validation factor. The GPR data were positively correlated with DN, and relationships between GPR data, peat bulk density and degree of humification (H) were also found. From the radargrams {{it was possible to}} distinguish the interface between the peat and the mineral substratum {{as well as some of}} the internal structure of the peat deposit, and thus to derive the total thickness of the peat deposit and (in some cases) the thicknesses of its constituent layers. The first evaluation of the propagation velocity of electromagnetic waves in Azorean peat yielded a value of 0. 04 m ns- 1 for 100 MHz and 500 MHz radar antennae. For one of the study sites, the GPR data were analysed using GIS software to produce tridimensional models and thus to estimate the volumes of peat layers.

The damages to IS in pull - through operation and in those who had hypermotile proximal bowel segments have increased the need for increasing the IS pressure. Materials and Methods: 35 children with fecal incontinence after pull - t hrough, who presented to our unit from January 2008 to February 2012, were enrolled in the study and investigated with endoanal sonography and anorectal manometry. The bulking agent was injected into the sub - mucosal anal plane of IS. The assessments undertaken were clinical assessment of the functional score and anorectal manometery for 6 - 12 months. Data were analyzed with IBM SPSS version 21 using repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA). Friedman test was used for analyzing soilage score changes during the study. Results: Manometry readings before and 6 months after intervention were 21. 8 ¬± 4. 2 and 25. 2 ¬± 4. 7 mmH 2 O, respectively. High - pressure zone area changed from 1. 98 ¬± 0. 63 to 2. 8 ¬± 0. 75 cm (P < 0. 0001). B efore intervention, all the patients had complaints of soilage and complete incontinency.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringStacey KuleszaIn Kansas, {{mechanically}} stabilized earth (MSE) {{retaining walls}} are typically backfilled with coarse aggregate. Current backfill material testing procedures {{used by the}} Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) utilize on-site observations for construction quality assurance and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials standard T 288 - 12 (‚ÄúStandard Method of Test for Determining Minimum Laboratory Soil Resistivity‚Äù). AASHTO T 288 - 12 is designed to test a soil sample‚Äôs electrical resistivity (ER) that correlates to its corrosion potential. However, the test, based on material passing through a No. 10 sieve, is inappropriate for coarse aggregate typically used by KDOT as the aggregate will be retained on a No. 10 sieve and potentially leads to over-conservative designs. However, ER imaging provides a two-dimensional (2 D) profile of bulk ER of backfill material, thereby yielding more information regarding backfill uniformity compared to traditional sampling. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize bulk ER of in-place MSE wall backfill aggregate. In this study, MSE walls selected by KDOT were tested using ER imaging during construction to determine bulk ER of the backfill. Variations within backfill ER may be a result of varying aggregate material, inclusions of fines, thoroughness of compaction, and the presence of water. ER imaging was used on five walls: four MSE walls and one gravity retaining wall that contained no reinforcement. One MSE wall contained metal reinforcement, while the other four walls contained geosynthetic. The ER imaging field method produced a 2 D profile that depicted ER uniformity for <b>bulk</b> analysis. A <b>post</b> processing algorithm was generated to remove the subjective nature of the ER imaging results. The program determines the bulk ER based upon the ER imaging results. These results indicate that the laboratory analysis of AASHTO T 288 - 12 under-estimates the bulk ER of in-situ backfill material. Identification of a material‚Äôs bulk ER will help characterize the ER of aggregates in a complementary KDOT project. Results of this study will be used to recommend an in-situ test method for aggregate used by KDOT...|$|R
40|$|Silicon {{nanowire}} based multiple gate {{metal oxide}} field effect transistors(MG-MOSFET) appear as replacements for conventional <b>bulk</b> transistors in <b>post</b> 45 nm technology nodes. In such transistors the short channel effect(SCE) {{is controlled by}} the device geometry, and hence an undoped (or, lightly doped) ultra-thin body silicon nanowire is used to sustain the channel. The use of undoped body also solves several issues in bulk MOSFETs e. g., random dopant fluctuations, mobility degradation and compatibility with midgap metal gates. The electrostatic integrity of such devices increases with the scaling down of the body thickness. Since the quantization of electron energy cannot be ignored in such ultra-thin body devices, it is extremely important to consider quantum effects in their threshold voltage models. Most of the models reported so far are valid for long channel double gate devices. Only Munteanu et al. [Journal of non-crystalline solids vol 351 pp 1911 - 1918 2005] have reported threshold voltage model for short channel symmetric double gate MOSFET, however it involves unphysical fitting parameters. Only Munteanu et al. [Molecular simulation vol 31 pp 839 - 845 2005] reported threshold voltage model for quad gate transistor which is implicit in nature. On the other hand no modeling work has been reported for other types of MG-MOSFETs (e. g., tri gate, cylindrical body) apart from numerical simulation results. In this work we report physically based closed form quantum threshold voltage models for short channel symmetric double gate, quad gate and cylindrical body gate-all-around MOSFETs. In these devices quantum effects aries mainly due to the structural confinement of electron energy. Proposed models are based on the analytical solution of two or three-dimensional Poisson equation and one or two-dimensional Schrodinger equation depending on the device geometries. Judicial approximations have been taken to simplify the models in order to make them closed form and efficient for large scale circuit simulation. Effort has also been put to model the quantum threshold voltage of tri gate MOSFET. However it is found that the energy quantization in tri gate devices are mainly due to electronic confinement and hence {{it is very difficult to}} develop closed form analytical equations for the threshold voltage. Thus in this work the modeling of tri gate devices have been limited to long channel cases. All the models are validated against the professional numerical simulator...|$|R
