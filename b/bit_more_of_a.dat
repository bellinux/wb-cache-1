The songs were strung together {{with a bit of}} character and plot and a good bit of improvisation. The performance by Goldfaden, Grodner, Sokher Goldstein, and possibly as many as three other men went over well. The first performance was either Di bobe mitn einikl (Grandmother and Granddaughter) or Dos bintl holts (The Bundle of sticks); sources disagree. (Some reports suggest that Goldfaden himself was a poor singer, or even a non-singer and poor actor; according to Bercovici, these reports stem from Goldfaden's own self-disparaging remarks or from his countenance as an old man in New York, but contemporary reports show him to have been a decent, though not earth-shattering, actor and singer.) ...|$|E

500|$|The {{competition}} between Kieswetter and Buttler for England's one-day wicket-keeping role also caused conflict at Somerset for the 2013 season: both players wanted to fulfil the {{role for the}} county. Kieswetter began the season as the wicket-keeper in the County Championship, but broke his thumb during the third match of the season, which {{kept him out of}} action for six weeks. Kieswetter had a particularly strong Twenty20 season, finishing as the leading run-scorer in the 2013 Friends Life t20 with , including five half-centuries. His teammate, Peter Trego, praised Kieswetter's ability to build big innings in Twenty20 cricket, and Kieswetter himself said that he [...] "tried to be a <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> responsible player, rather than just power blazing." [...] He scored a late-season century against Warwickshire in the County Championship, but in a season in which Somerset struggled against relegation, he scored a relatively modest 606 first-class runs at an average of 31.89. At the end of the season, Buttler, whose contract with Somerset had expired, announced that he was joining Lancashire, leaving Kieswetter as the clear first-choice wicket-keeper at Somerset.|$|E

500|$|Bungie {{used the}} beta to fix mistakes, glitches, and balance issues within {{gameplay}} elements. [...] "We needed our fans to provide feedback," [...] said Lehto, adding {{that having a}} large audience to [...] "hammer" [...] on the game allowed them to gather useful feedback to mold the finished product. The game automatically collected statistics such as upload and matchmaking speeds, as well as game preferences; sorting out what Jarrard called [...] "the more subjective anecdotal feedback" [...] from emails, notes, and forums proved more difficult. The Reach beta generated over 360,000 forum posts on Bungie's community forums. Bungie created official threads for groups of issues to manage the high volume of feedback; [...] "We tried {{to give people a}} little <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> direct avenue to give that feedback and to make our lives easier.

Chris Carney, lead designer for the multiplayer mode, recalled vocal dissatisfaction with the pistol early in the beta; {{by the end of the}} beta, the weapon was responsible for most of the kills coming from newly included weapons in the game. Bungie deployed special test matches to eliminate lurking variables, balance gameplay, and make other informed changes.|$|E

Unlike {{her debut}} album where she travelled between cities, Lewis remained in Los Angeles for {{the recording of}} Echo, which took nine months to produce. It contains ballads, racier tracks and dancefloor anthems. Lewis titled the album Echo [...] "since an echo describes a big, organic sound," [...] and it appealed to her love of fantasy as Echo was a nymph who, in Greek mythology, [...] "pined away till only her voice remained." [...] In August 2009 Lewis told her official website: [...] "I'm {{in the midst of}} the recording process, working with incredible songwriters and producers, and my music has really evolved.

2500|$|Lewis {{commented on}} the musical style of her debut album {{describing}} the album as [...] "classic songs with a contemporary edge", with R and [...] "fresh pop" [...] styles, ballads and [...] "soulful up-tempo numbers".

Lewis's second album, [...] "Echo", mixed pop and R during an interview with Variety magazine, she said on the album's sound that she [...] "wanted the album {{to have a little}} <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> live feel to it, with a little more live instrumentation."

[...] Several years before Angel debuted, Joss Whedon {{developed}} the concept behind Buffy the Vampire Slayer to invert the Hollywood formula of [...] "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie." [...] The character Angel was first seen in the first episode and became a regular, appearing in the opening credits during seasons 2 and 3. According to the fictional universe first established by Slayer, the 'Buffyverse', Angel was born in 18th-century Ireland; after being turned into a soulless, immortal vampire, he became legendary for his evil acts, until a band of wronged Gypsies punished him by restoring his soul, overwhelming him with guilt. Angel eventually {{set out on a}} path of redemption, hoping that he could make up for his past through good deeds. In Buffys Season Three finale, he leaves Sunnydale for L.A. to continue his atonement without Buffy. Whedon believed that [...] "Angel was the one character who was bigger than life {{in the same way that}} Buffy was, a kind of superhero." [...] Whedon has compared the series to its parent, [...] "It's a little bit more straightforward action show and a little <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> guys' show." ...|$|E

We want to show something that’s more high class, that adult males of our generation could look at a woman [...] and be impressed with her as a woman, not just as a pin-up," [...] as opposed to the previous concept of just [...] "make her breasts big and just make them jiggle." [...] Dead or Alive 5s overseas producer Peter Garza said the game's revised aesthetic direction: [...] "Dead or Alive is known for its sexiness and high-kicking characters and certain aspects of the physics engine... Those are definitely going to be in Dead or Alive 5 - it's part of the series, it's part of its history and it's part of why people like it. But we're trying to take a <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mature take on it." [...] After the release, the game's director Yohei Shimbori said they were originally [...] "getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality -- to tone down the sexiness of the game, and of the characters." [...] However, the team then changed their decision due to negative feedback from fans who were playing the alpha demo version who demanded bigger breasts. Shimbori said: [...] "That was kind of surprising. There's definitely still room for having sexualized aspects," [...] adding that he [...] "really tries" [...] to take fan feedback into account and to keep an open mind. Hayashi himself made a 180 turn from his previous position. Asked [...] "what would you say to those people who think that the bikini-clad babes in DOA5 are sexist," [...] he said their goal was to create [...] "the cutest chicks in videogames" [...] and so they made a lot of effort to develop an advanced breast physics model that works differently with various types of clothing.
