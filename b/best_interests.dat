40|$|This thesis explores {{current and}} {{historical}} child custody {{laws in the}} State of Arizona and how they have correlated with child development theories. It discusses the impact child development theories have had on Arizona child custody cases. Additionally, it includes an overview of early Arizona Supreme Court cases and the implications it has on the <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of the child. The thesis also provides insight to problems with Arizona courts and the actors involved with making the decision for the <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of the child. The investigation demonstrates a disconnection between judicial discretion and the <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of the child standard. An example from the United States Supreme Court case Troxel v Granville (1999) is reviewed to illustrate how courts discretion, in general, can be misused. Overall, court discretion in Arizona is liberal and the impact it has on child custody decisions can sometimes conflict with the <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of the child...|$|R
5|$|In {{many social}} insect communities, sex is {{determined}} through haplodiploidy. Haploid male drones develop from unfertilized eggs while diploid females develop from fertilized eggs. Queens of a colony may mate {{with one or}} several drones. On average, a queen shares half of her genes with her sons, but only shares a quarter of her genes with the sons of fertile female workers. Therefore, {{it is in the}} queen's <b>best</b> <b>interests</b> to have her own sons raised, and not the sons of workers. Workers can reproduce in many ants, bees, and wasps because male offspring come from unfertilized eggs.|$|E
5|$|Parents {{are assumed}} to have the child's <b>best</b> <b>interests</b> in mind. Ethically, it is {{imperative}} that the medical practitioner informs the parents about the benefits and risks of the procedure and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents come to a decision about circumcising the child before he is born, and a discussion of the benefits and risks of the procedure with a physician has not been shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child's <b>best</b> <b>interests</b> and may ethically perform the procedure. Equally, without a clear medical benefit relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform the procedure. Medical organization such as the British Medical Association state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform the procedure in such situations.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} and understand how the principle of the child’s <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> in the asylum process for families with children is interpreted and implemented in practice by the asylum bureaucrats at the Swedish Migration Agency. Our questions are: “How is the <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of the child in families with children interpreted by the asylum bureaucrats at the Swedish Migration Agency?” "How are asylum bureaucrats at the Swedish Migration Agency reasoning about the implementation in practice of the child's <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> in families with children? The essay rests upon semi-structured interviews with eight asylum bureaucrats at three different asylum units. The interviews are based on an interview guide together with a vignette, which purpose was to see how the interviewees are implementing the <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of the child in a specific case of a potential application. We are analyzing our results by using Lipsky’s theory of street-level bureaucrats and their professional discretion. We are also using Roine Johansson’s (2007) interpretation of Lipsky and Svensson et al., (2008) and their perspectives about professional discretion. Our main findings and conclusions in the study are showing that the asylum bureaucrats interpretations of the <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of the child are statutory. According to the asylum bureaucrats, the main definition of the principle is related to the importance of talking with the children. These statements in the interviews also reflects how they look upon the implementation in practice of the child's <b>best</b> <b>interest.</b> The asylum bureaucrats felt they have a wide discretion in their everyday work...|$|R

5|$|Rodham then entered Yale Law School, {{where she}} {{served on the}} {{editorial}} board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action. During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center, learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the <b>Best</b> <b>Interests</b> of the Child (1973). She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale–New Haven Hospital and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor. In the summer of 1970 she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman's Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers' issues including education, health and housing. Edelman later became a significant mentor. Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey, with Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{responded by}} {{promptly}} moving south, besieging Arundel and trapping Matilda inside the castle. Stephen then {{agreed to a}} truce proposed by his brother, Henry of Blois; the full details of the agreement are not known, but the results were that Matilda and her household of knights were released from the siege and escorted to the south-west of England, where they were reunited with Robert of Gloucester. The reasons for Matilda's release remain unclear. Stephen may {{have thought it was}} in his own <b>best</b> <b>interests</b> to release the Empress and concentrate instead on attacking Robert, seeing Robert, rather than Matilda, as his main opponent {{at this point in the}} conflict. Arundel Castle was also considered almost impregnable, and Stephen may have been worried that he risked tying down his army in the south whilst Robert roamed freely in the west. Another theory is that Stephen released Matilda out of a sense of chivalry; Stephen had a generous, courteous personality and women were not normally expected to be targeted in Anglo-Norman warfare.|$|E

5|$|The Committee {{first met}} in London on 9 September 1936 and was {{attended}} by representatives of solely European countries, and did not include Switzerland (whose policy of neutrality prohibited even inter-governmental action). It was chaired by W. S. Morrison, Britain's Financial Secretary to the Treasury. The meeting was concerned mostly with procedure only. Charles Corbin represented the French, Italy by Dino Grandi, and the Soviets were represented by Ivan Maisky. Germany was represented by Ribbentrop (with Otto Christian Archibald von Bismarck as deputy) but left the running to Grandi, although they found working with him difficult; Portugal, whose presence had been a Soviet requirement, was not represented. There was little hope in the committee, since the British and French would {{have been aware of}} the continued shipment of arms to the Nationalists from Italy and Germany. Britain protested twice to the Italians, once in response to Italian aircraft landing in Majorca, the other pre-emptively over any significant change in the Mediterranean. Stanley Baldwin, British prime minister, and Blum attempted to halt global exports to Spain, believing it in Europe's <b>best</b> <b>interests.</b> Soviet aid to the Republic was threatened in the Committee.

5|$|Although McGregor envisaged the League as a {{friendly}} union, within which clubs would share ticket revenues {{and work together}} in their mutual <b>best</b> <b>interests,</b> the immediate effect of its creation was that football came {{to be treated as}} a business for the first time, as opposed to something that players and officials simply regarded as a pastime. All the clubs involved experienced significant increases in their turnover, which at Aston Villa, McGregor's own club, increased more than sixfold between 1889 and 1899. The wages paid to players, however, remained low due to restrictions imposed by the FA, so clubs were able to use their increased profitability to build larger stadiums and accommodate ever larger crowds of spectators. Although the League initially contained a small number of clubs, all of which were based in the northern half of the country, by {{the early years of the}} twentieth century it included clubs from all parts of England. At its peak nearly 100 clubs played in the Football League, and it remained the pre-eminent competition in English football until the 1990s, when the top clubs broke away to form the Premier League. In keeping with McGregor's views on mutual support and co-operation, gate receipts were shared amongst the clubs until the 1980s, which helped to ensure that a select few wealthy clubs were not able to dominate the competition. McGregor himself had little interest in the business aspect of football, and was adamant that the Football League should not challenge the longstanding authority of the FA. The success of the Football League directly inspired the creation of similar competitions in other countries, beginning with Scotland, where the Scottish Football League was formed in 1890.|$|E
