50|$|Two major uses of GGBS {{are in the}} {{production}} of quality-improved slag cement, namely Portland <b>Blastfurnace</b> <b>cement</b> (PBFC) and high-slag blast-furnace cement (HSBFC), with GGBS content ranging typically from 30 to 70%; and in {{the production}} of ready-mixed or site-batched durable concrete.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Chloride induced {{corrosion}} {{of steel}} reinforcement {{is the main}} cause of deterioration of reinforced concrete marine structures. This paper investigates the relative performance of alternative repair options with respect to the deterioration of reinforced concrete bridge elements in marine environments. Focus is placed on the initiation phase of reinforcement corrosion. A laboratory study is described which involved exposing concrete samples to accelerated chloride-ion ingress. The study examined the relative efficiencies of two repair methods, namely Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) concrete and a concrete which utilised Ground Granulated <b>Blastfurnace</b> <b>Cement</b> (GGBS) as a partial cement replacement. The mix designs and materials utilised were identical to those implemented in the repair of a marine bridge on the South East coast of Ireland in 2007. The results of this testing regime serve to inform input variables employed in probabilistic modelling of deterioration for subsequent reliability based analysis to compare the relative performance of the studied repair options...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the results of}} a suite of tests designed to assess the structural and durability characteristics of hydraulic lime-pozzolan concretes. Specifically this paper reports on the rate of strength development, elastic modulus, linear shrinkage and rate of carbonation of four hydraulic-lime-pozzolan concretes. The purpose of this investigation was to ascertain the technical feasibility of producing high strength concretes using hydraulic lime and pozzolans as an alternative binder to Portland cement. Results have emonstrated that 28 -day compressive cube strengths of 35 MPa can be attained by water-cured lime-pozzolan concretes. These strengths make the material suitable for many structural applications. The results are presented alongside comparable test results for Portland-cement (CEMI) and <b>blastfurnace</b> <b>cement</b> (CIII/A) concretes as a point of reference. Similarities and differences in material characteristics are discussed in terms of fundamental material properties {{and in terms of the}} emergent threats and opportunities for the potential development of these novel concretes...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{studying}} the antifungal effect of ground granulated blastfurnace slag (GGBS) and the cements made from it. Antifungal effects were tested on the fungi using the procedure {{given in the}} Czech national standard CSN 72 4310 : 1977 - Testing the mould proofness properties of building products and materials. A mixture of the fungi Aspergillus niger, Chaetomium globosum, Penicillium funiculosum, Paecilomyces variotii and Gliocladium virens was used for testing. The scale for evaluating mould proofness properties according to CSN 72 4310 : 1977 is from 0 to 5 in degree of fungi growth, where a value of 0 means that no growth of fungi occurs and the building products and materials possess fungistatic properties. The study confirms the fungistatic propeties of GGBS with mould proofness property 0. The addition of GGBS to cements from 65 wt. % to 95 wt. % ensures the achieving of a fungistatic environment, which enables the production of fungistatic <b>blastfurnace</b> <b>cements</b> CEM III/A 32. 5 N (with GGBS content of 65 wt. %), CEM III/B 32. 5 N and CEM III/C 32. 5 N with mould proofness property 0...|$|R
40|$|In {{the nuclear}} industry, cement-based {{materials}} are extensively used to encapsulate spent {{ion exchange resins}} (IERs) before their final disposal in a repository. It {{is well known that}} the cement has to be carefully selected to prevent any deleterious expansion of the solidified waste form, but the reasons for this possible expansion are not clearly established. This work aims at filling the gap. The swelling pressure of IERs is first investigated as a function of ions exchange and ionic strength. It is shown that pressures of a few tenths of MPa can be produced by decreases in the ionic strength of the bulk solution, or by ion exchanges (2 Na+ instead of Ca 2 +, Na+ instead of K+). Then, the chemical evolution of cationic resins initially in the Na+ form is characterized in CEM I (Portland cement) and CEM III (Portland <b>cement</b> + <b>blastfurnace</b> slag) <b>cements</b> at early age and an explanation is proposed for the better stability of CEM III material...|$|R
5000|$|Portland clinker is {{the main}} {{constituent}} of most cements. In Portland cement, a little calcium sulfate (typically 3-10%) is added in order to retard the hydration of tricalcium aluminate. The calcium sulfate may consist of natural gypsum, anhydrite, or synthetic wastes such as flue-gas desulfurization gypsum. In addition, up to 5% calcium carbonate and up to 1% of other minerals may be added. It is normal to add {{a certain amount of}} water, and small quantities of organic grinding aids and performance enhancers. [...] "Blended cements" [...] and Masonry cements may include large additions (up to 40%) of natural pozzolans, fly ash, limestone, silica fume or metakaolin. <b>Blastfurnace</b> slag <b>cement</b> may include up to 70% ground granulated blast furnace slag. See cement. Gypsum and calcium carbonate are relatively soft minerals, and rapidly grind to ultra-fine particles. Grinding aids are typically chemicals added at a rate of 0.01-0.03% that coat the newly formed surfaces of broken mineral particles and prevent re-agglomeration. [...] They include 1,2-propanediol, acetic acid, triethanolamine and lignosulfonates.|$|R
40|$|Use of Rhenish trass in (historic) lime mortars is well known. However, its {{application}} to concrete has not been investigated elaborately. In the past, trass {{was used as a}} pozzolanic addition to concrete for marine structures in the Netherlands. Recent investigations of several structures have shown that identification of trass in aged concretes by polarization-and-fluorescence microscopy is difficult. In order to facilitate PFM studies, historic mixtures were recast. Two mixtures have been recast, viz. a mixture of 300 kg m- 3 ordinary Portland cement (CEM I) and another mixture of 310 kg m- 3 ground granulated <b>blastfurnace</b> slag <b>cement</b> (CEM III/B), both with an addition of 10 % trass by cement mass. Concrete mixes were originally designed for a major lock, built in the 1920 ’s, and a quay constructed in Rotterdam harbour in the 1970 ’s, respectively. Difficulties of recognizing trass in aged concretes by PFM and apparent effects of trass on both microstructure of the concrete and durability are discussed. Durability in a maritime environment has extensively been studied in the case of Rotterdam harbour. It is shown that addition of 10 % of trass to CEM III/B has no effect on the durability of concrete...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{search for}} {{techniques}} and materials able to improve structure quality and durability has lead to research some methods that {{are able to}} measure the transfer properties of composites. Cement type has an important influence on mortar performance, and chemical and physical deteriorations modify microstructure, and thereby transfer properties. The aim of this work is to evaluate two methods which can measure the transfer properties of cement based materials: capillary absorption and air permeability tests in mortars produced with <b>blastfurnace</b> slag Portland <b>cement.</b> The relationship between these two methods was investigated. The mortars were submitted to steam curing (60 ºC) and standard curing. Results show that steam curing improved initial compressive strength. At 28 days all mortars had the same performance. Water absorption coefficient and air permeability was higher for steam cured mortars. There was a significant correlation between both tests results...|$|R
