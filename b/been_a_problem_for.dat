5|$|Bautista throws three pitches: a fastball, a curveball, and a changeup. His fastball {{travels in}} the high 90mph range. His curve can break down sharply, and he learned the changeup from Pedro Martínez. Wildness had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> Bautista {{throughout}} his career. He has trouble controlling his fastball and walks {{a great deal of}} hitters, which has often contributed to his departure from teams.|$|E
5|$|Mota {{has three}} {{different}} kinds of pitches: a fastball, a slider, and a circle changeup. The slider is the pitch he usually uses to get outs. Wildness has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> him, though, and his fastball is easy to hit when thrown over the plate. In the past, he has thrown a splitter and a curveball.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, {{there was}} serious {{flooding}} in Salford, {{caused by a}} bottleneck at {{a bend in the}} river at Strangeways, on the border with Manchester. Flooding had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> hundreds of years, and, in 1946, {{the decision was made to}} straighten and widen the river to increase its capacity. Work started in 1951 but it was not until September 1970 that water first flowed through the Anaconda Cut. The total cost of the project was £2m.|$|E

5|$|Natural predators of the Puerto Rican amazon {{include the}} red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), the broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus), the {{peregrine}} falcon (Falco peregrinus) and the pearly-eyed thrasher (Margarops fuscatus). The thrasher invaded Puerto Rico in the mid-20th century and has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> the parrot population since 1973; to combat this, specially designed deep nests {{were prepared for}} the parrots in subsequent years to prevent competition from the invaders. Introduced honeybees (Apis mellifera), the related Hispaniolan amazon (Amazona ventralis), black rats (Rattus rattus) and Indian mongooses (Herpestes javanicus) may compete for nesting cavities, and the latter two may eat eggs and chicks.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez {{throws a}} fastball that travels about ninety-one mph for his main pitch, though it {{sometimes}} {{can go up}} to ninety-five mph. His other pitches (slurve and change-up) travel in the low eighties. Wildness has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> Sánchez; he has walked 10% – 15% of major-league batters faced each season. However, he also strikes {{out a lot of}} batters; he struck out two hundred {{for the first time in}} his career in 2010. That year, he led all qualifying MLB starting pitchers in limiting hits per innings pitched (6.61 H/9), and his career swinging-strike percentage is among the best in the majors.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} combat {{aircraft}} had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> ONUC. The UN had been delaying {{the commencement of}} the operation until sufficient air strength had been amassed to conduct a single attack that could destroy the Katangese Air Force. They feared that a limited attack would fail to eliminate all Katangese aircraft and stretch their own forces thin, thereby allowing Katanga to disperse its air forces among hidden airfields and launch retaliatory attacks on Kamina Air Base. India had withdrawn its Canberra bombers in October to guard against China, and Ethiopia repatriated its force of Sabres after one was lost in an accident. However, new air surveillance radar equipment was deployed in Kamina and Élisabethville. The ONUC Air Division was bolstered in November by the delivery of two Saab 29 Tunnan (J-29) reconnaissance-variant jets from Sweden, greatly enhancing the force's intelligence capabilities. This was followed shortly thereafter {{by the arrival of}} several J-29 combat aircraft and a 380-strong anti-aircraft unit from Norway. In all, the UN would field 10 combat J-29s in the operation.|$|E

25|$|Government {{corruption}} in Madagascar has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> {{more than a}} decade. Transparency International has rated the country between a 1.7 and a 3.4 on its 10-point Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), with a score less than 3.0 indicating rampant corruption. With the political disturbance in 2009, Madagascar fell from a 3.4 to a 3.0, and suffered a slide in rank from 85 out of 180 countries to a rank of 99.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the conflict, ethnic identity is now of much greater social importance in Bosnia than it was prior to 1992. From the 1960s until the beginning of the war, nearly twelve percent of marriages were mixed (between members of different communities), and young citizens would often refer to themselves as Bosnians rather than identifying their ethnicity. After the conflict it has been effectively mandatory to be identified as either Bosniak, Serb or Croat and this has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> the children of rape victims as they come of age.|$|E

25|$|Human {{trafficking}} in Southeast Asia have long <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> {{the area and}} still is prevalent today. It has been observed that as economies continue to grow, the demand for labor {{is at an all-time}} high in the industrial sector and the sex tourism sector. A mix of impoverished individuals and the desire for more wealth creates an environment for human traffickers to benefit in the Southeast Asia region. Many nations within the region have taken preventative measures to end human trafficking within their borders and punish traffickers operating there.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the craft}} has been waning {{and may be}} in danger of extinction. On Comonfort Street in Metepec {{there are dozens of}} pottery {{workshops}} but only two of these remain making the trees. One major reason for this is cheap imitations, mostly imported from Asia. This has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> many Mexican crafts, with the federal government stepping in to develop trademarks and “denomination of origin” for traditional crafts. In 2009, the Tree of Life was trademarked for artisans from Metepec and neighboring Calimaya, befitting the approximately 300 families that dedicate themselves to making them. In addition to authenticity, there are plans to use the trademark to promote the product internationally.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, Chartres' windows {{have been}} remarkably fortunate. The medieval glass largely escaped harm during the Huguenot iconoclasm and the {{religious}} wars of the 16th century although the west rose sustained damage from artillery fire in 1591. The relative darkness of the interior seems to have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> some. A few windows were replaced with much lighter grisaille glass in the 14th century to improve illumination, particularly {{on the north side}} and several more were replaced with clear glass in 1753 as part of the reforms to liturgical practice that also led to the removal of the jubé. The installation of the Vendôme Chapel between two buttresses of the nave in the early 15th century resulted in the loss of one more lancet window, though it did allow for the insertion of a fine late-gothic window with donor portraits of Louis de Bourbon and his family witnessing the Coronation of the Virgin with assorted saints.|$|E

500|$|He {{noted that}} Lord Hoffmann in Hall v Simons (2001) {{had said that}} a witness owed no duty of care in respect of his evidence, only a duty to tell the truth, but he {{considered}} that to be incorrect, since it failed to distinguish between witnesses of fact and experts. The expert would have {{a contract with the}} client in which he agreed to perform the duties that he owed to the court, and so there was no conflict between the two duties. In this respect, expert witnesses were more like advocates, who owed duties to client and court, than to witnesses of fact. He noted that barristers had long been immune from negligence claims until the decision of the House of Lords in Hall v Simons. Removing their immunity, he said, had not led to any diminution in advocates performing their duty to the court, and it would be [...] "mere conjecture" [...] to assume that this would be any different for expert witnesses. Neither had vexatious claims <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> barristers – in any event, the present case was not vexatious and there were other hurdles, both procedural and financial, in the way of an unsuccessful litigant making unmeritorious claims against an expert. As there was no justification for continuing to hold that expert witnesses were [...] "immune from suit in relation to the evidence they give in court or for the views they express in anticipation of court proceedings", he concluded that the immunity for claims for breach of duty (but not defamation) should be abolished.|$|E

2500|$|A review from 1996 said of Crying, “ If expressionist art {{demands the}} {{simultaneous}} release and recording of deep feeling, then {{this might be}} expressionism's quintessence - but as the tape plays again, and again, emotion becomes performance. What may have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> Jackson Pollock here appears as strategy: repeated, the gesture that carries emotion loses meaning. Yet enough of a trace of it remains that one would be ashamed to write it off as rote or fake; better {{to say that it}} becomes elusive and unreliable. And Starr, who seems to show us herself so openly, eludes us too." ...|$|E
