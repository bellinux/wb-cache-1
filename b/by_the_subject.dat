5|$|Barrymore's {{achievements}} and his colorful life have ensured that several biographical studies followed his 1926 autobiography, Confessions of an Actor. Alma Power-Waters produced a 1941 study, authorized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> John Barrymore: The Legend and the Man; Fowler, wrote Good Night, Sweet Prince: The Life and Times of John Barrymore (1943); Alpert published The Barrymores (1964); and John Kobler wrote Damned in Paradise: The Life of John Barrymore (1977), although Norden noted in 2000 {{that many of}} these earlier works are less than reliable. Those he identified as being more thoroughly researched are Peters' 1990 history, The House of Barrymore, and his own study of the actor's work in John Barrymore: A Bio-Bibliography (1995). Subsequent to Norden's comments on the available literature, Morrison published the positively reviewed John Barrymore, Shakespearean Actor in 1997, which focuses on Barrymore's stage work.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Potts was poorly {{received}} by critics. Etty's admirers were angered by his apparent abandonment of history painting for the then poorly regarded field of portrait painting, while Etty's critics {{felt he had}} demonstrated {{that he did not}} have the technical skills to produce high quality portraits, and was simply trying to use his name to make money in the more lucrative field of portraiture. History paintings were generally sold at exhibition for no less than the asking price, and as a consequence often remained unsold. Portraits were commissioned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> or their family, providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist. History painting was much more highly regarded as an art form; portrait painting was seen as reflecting nature whereas history painting involved more creativity and also gave the artist the opportunity to tell moral lessons.|$|E

5|$|Roughly speaking, Mongolian {{has eight}} cases: {{nominative}} (unmarked), genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, instrumental, comitative and directional. If a direct object is definite, it {{must take the}} accusative, while it must take the nominative if it is unspecific. In addition to case, a number of postpositions exist that usually govern genitive, ablative, or comitative case or a form of the nominative that has sometimes -Vn either for lexical historical reasons or analogy (thus maybe becoming an attributive case suffix). Nouns can take reflexive-possessive clitics indicating that the marked noun is possessed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of the sentence: bi najz(-)aa avarsan I friend- save- 'I saved my friend'. However, there are also somewhat noun-like adjectives to which case suffixes seemingly cannot be attached directly unless there is ellipsis. Plurality may be left unmarked, but there are overt plurality markers, {{some of which are}} restricted to humans. A noun that is modified by a numeral usually does not take any plural affix.|$|E
25|$|Typically, in passive clauses, what {{is usually}} {{expressed}} by the object (or sometimes another argument) of the verb is now expressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> while what is usually expressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> is either deleted, or is indicated by some adjunct of the clause. Thus, turning an active verb into a passive verb is a valence-decreasing process ("detransitivizing process"), because it turns transitive verbs into intransitive verbs. This {{is not always the}} case; for example in Japanese a passive-voice construction does not necessarily decrease valence.|$|E

The result of these investigations was later published by his wife Sophia. De Morgan believed that his career as a scientist might have been affected if he had revealed his interest in the study of spiritualism so he helped to publish the book anonymously. The book was published in 1863 titled From Matter to Spirit: The Result of Ten Years Experience in Spirit Manifestations.|$|E

25|$|The hyper-vigilance {{response}} {{can lead}} to the creation of endogenous stimuli that contribute to the perceived threat. A similar process may explain hallucinations, with slight variations, in which an evil presence is perceived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> to be attempting to suffocate them, either by pressing heavily on the chest or by strangulation. A neurological explanation hold that this results from a combination of the threat vigilance activation system and the muscle paralysis associated with sleep paralysis that removes voluntary control of breathing. Several features of REM breathing patterns exacerbate the feeling of suffocation. These include shallow rapid breathing, hypercapnia, and slight blockage of the airway, which is a symptom prevalent in sleep apnea patients.|$|E
25|$|A {{recognized}} {{skill is}} tolerance for ambiguity {{and being able}} to handle open-ended problems. For instance, a knowledge-based engineering system can enhance its operational aspect and thereby its stability through more involvement <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> matter expert, thereby opening up issues of limits that are related to being human. As in, many times, computational results have to be taken at face value due to several factors (hence the duck test's necessity arises) that even an expert cannot overcome. The end proof may be the final results (reasonable facsimile by simulation or artifact, working design, etc.) that are not guaranteed to be repeatable, may have been costly to attain (time and money), and so forth.|$|E
25|$|A mild form of {{hallucination}} {{is known}} as a disturbance, and can occur in most of the senses above. These may be things like seeing movement in peripheral vision, or hearing faint noises and/or voices. Auditory hallucinations are very common in schizophrenia. They may be benevolent (telling the subject good things about themselves) or malicious, cursing the subject, etc. Auditory hallucinations of the malicious type are frequently heard, for example people talking about the subject behind his/her back. Like auditory hallucinations, the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject's back. Their visual counterpart is the feeling of being looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent. Frequently, auditory hallucinations and their visual counterpart are experienced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> together.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether differing composition software formats, personality, and gender affect the psychological approach that middle school students employed in their compositions. <b>The</b> <b>subjects</b> (N = 77) were seventh and eighth grade band students enrolled in a Western middle school. <b>The</b> <b>subjects</b> were administered <b>the</b> Murphy-Meisgeier Type Indicator for Children (MMTIC) to determine their dominant personality function. Upon the completion of <b>the</b> personality inventory, <b>subjects</b> were given a 30 minute exploratory period using the iconic and standard notation composition software formats. Two compositions were created <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> in subsequent class periods using Making Music, the iconic format, and Making More Music, the standard notation composition format. Upon the completion of each composition <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> were administered <b>the</b> Measure of Psychological Approach toward Composition to determine which dominant psychological approach was used to create their composition. Descriptive statistics and the chi-square statistical test were used to determine the relationship between the independent variables and the psychological approaches used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects.</b> <b>The</b> findings of the study indicate that middle school students employ one of the four psychological approaches observed by Carbon (1986) as their dominant approach toward composition. Most often the intuitive approach was utilized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects,</b> followed <b>by</b> feeling, thinking, and sensing. Furthermore, the relationship between the psychological approach employed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> and <b>the</b> computer software format used during the composition process were found to be significant This finding suggests that middle school subjects are likely to employ the same psychological approach toward composition when using either an iconic or standard notation software format.
