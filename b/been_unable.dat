50|$|Mussels are {{somewhat}} stationary; they <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> to move long distances, {{which is why}} they live in very specific, stable habitats that fulfill all of their needs.

When their habitat is constantly being tampered with, they <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> to fully develop and reproduce.|$|R

5|$|Because Manor Marussia {{failed to}} notify the {{stewards}} of their inability to field a car, the team was summoned by the FIA to explain why they {{did not participate in}} qualifying.
