5|$|While Theophilus Cibber was disputing with Highmore and Ellys, Aaron Hill became {{interested}} in partnering at the Theatre Royal. Hill was earlier a partner at the theatre until he was removed during a previous actor riot {{that took place in}} June 1710. On 22 March 1733, Hill, in a letter to Benjamin Victor, a dramatist who had arranged the sale of Booth's shares to Highmore, criticised {{the fact that he was}} kept from <b>buying</b> <b>into</b> the theatre's management and attacked Theophilus. He offered 900 pounds for three years for Booth's shares and 1800 pounds for Mary Wilks's shares. Negotiations continued until May when they were dropped. Hester Booth, widow of Barton Booth, sold her remaining shares to Henry Giffard, the manager of Goodman's Fields Theatre, just few days after her husband died on 10 May.|$|E

500|$|Green Day and Dookies {{enormous}} sales {{paved the}} way for a host of bankable North American pop punk bands in the following decade. With punk rock's renewed visibility came concerns among some in the punk community that the music was being co-opted by the mainstream. They argued that by signing to major labels and appearing on MTV, punk bands like Green Day were <b>buying</b> <b>into</b> a system that punk was created to challenge. Such controversies {{have been part of the}} punk culture since 1977, when the Clash was widely accused of [...] "selling out" [...] for signing with CBS Records. The Vans Warped Tour and the mall chain store Hot Topic brought punk even further into the U.S. mainstream.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after signing}} a record deal with Lava Records, {{aspiring}} English singer Jessie J commenced {{to work on}} her debut album. She collaborated with songwriters and producers Dr. Luke and Claude Kelly in her first writing session, where [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] was conceived {{with the intention of}} being performed by Jessie J. However, she decided not to record the song, believing it was not edgy enough for her to perform. She explained, [...] "And I remember thinking this song is amazing, but I don't know if it's me 110 percent, you know. You can kind of feel it." [...] The song reached Cyrus while she was creating an EP with Dr. Luke. The writing team then reworked the lyrics, intending to write an accompanying theme for Cyrus' joint clothing line with Max Azria, exclusively sold in Wal-Mart stores. In order to please audiences, Dr. Luke, Kelly and Jessie J fixated on composing a fun, upbeat song that narrated reflections of Cyrus' personality. [...] "They feel they're <b>buying</b> <b>into</b> a great experience but also <b>buying</b> <b>into</b> the artist," [...] Kelly said of the song's fans. To write his contributions to the song, Kelly said he desired to mimic Cyrus' songwriting: [...] "It's the same song from a different point of view, you just have to find that unique perspective." [...] To record the song's instrumentation, they decided to mingle computerized sound with [...] "the warmth of live instrumentation", using live electric guitars and drums. Cyrus was pleased with the song and selected it partially due to a need of tracks for The Time of Our Lives. This is the first of two collaborations between Dr. Luke and Cyrus. Dr. Luke would later co-produce Cyrus' 2013 smash hit single [...] "Wrecking Ball".|$|E

We were a pretty traditional bunch of guys, positive for civil rights and women's rights but formal, transformed by the social revolution to some extent but not <b>buying</b> <b>into</b> something we considered detrimental to our country." [...] Gore helped his father write an anti-war address to the Democratic National Convention of 1968 but stayed with his parents in their hotel room during the violent protests.|$|E

He praised the early scene where Amy was abandoned for the [...] "zingy dialogue" [...] but found himself [...] "enjoying the cleverness of the explanation without really <b>buying</b> <b>into</b> it". He expressed confusion at how the time-shift worked and thought the problem was too thin {{to carry out the}} whole episode, and that Amy's abandonment and love for Rory which was left [...] " [...] pull it off".

500|$|In house music, {{a desire}} to define precise stylistic strands and taste markets saw the {{interposition}} of prefixes like [...] "progressive", [...] "tribal", and [...] "intelligent". According to disc jockey and producer Carl Craig, the term [...] "progressive" [...] was used in Detroit in the early 1980s in reference to Italian disco. The music was dubbed [...] "progressive" [...] because it drew upon the influence of Giorgio Moroder's Euro disco rather than the disco inspired by the symphonic Philadelphia sound. In this context, Reynolds criticizes terms like [...] "progressive" [...] and [...] "intelligent", arguing that [...] "when an underground scene starts talking this talk, it's usually a sign that it's gearing up the media game as a prequel to <b>buying</b> <b>into</b> traditional music industry structure of auteur-stars, concept albums, and long-term careers. Above all, it's a sign of impending musical debility, creeping self-importance, and the hemorrhaging away of fun." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1949, O'Hara played {{what she}} {{described}} as a [...] "frustrated talent manager who shoots her star client in a jealous rage" [...] opposite Melvyn Douglas in A Woman's Secret. She only agreed {{to appear in the}} production to meet the one-picture-a-year contractual obligation to RKO. It was a box office flop and at the time not well received critically—director Nicholas Ray himself was dissatisfied with it. She next had a role as a wealthy widow who falls in love with an alcoholic artist ( [...] Dana Andrews) in the Victorian melodrama The Forbidden Street, which was shot at Shepperton Studios in London. O'Hara felt that her performance was poor and admitted that she did not have her heart set on the film. After the poorly received comedy Father Was a Fullback, [...] dismissed by Picturegoer magazine as an [...] "unhappy mixture of Freud and football", she starred in her first film with Universal Pictures, the escapist adventure, Bagdad, portraying Princess Marjan. The film was shot on location in the Alabama Hills of Lone Pine, California. O'Hara noted that the film earned a tremendous amount of money for Universal, and its success led to Universal <b>buying</b> <b>into</b> her RKO contract. Malone wrote that she sings, dances, fights, and loves in a tale of derring-do that ticks all the requisite boxes for an opulent history lesson", adding that [...] "when it came to dexterity in action, O'Hara was a nonpareil".|$|E

500|$|Bruce was high-minded {{and ambitious}} in setting an agenda as prime {{minister}} he pursued complex and aspiring schemes of economic, social and administrative development, including grandiose {{solutions to the problem}} of industrial relations and an egalitarian reworking of the British Empire. In his diplomatic career he pursued better treatment for the Commonwealth and programs through the League of Nations and United Nations that would address world questions of pressing social and economic concern, culminating in his most ambitious work to eliminate world hunger through the Food and Agriculture Organization. The Australian government even nominated Bruce for the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition for these efforts. Yet his schemes frequently bordered on the idealistic, and he was frequently disappointed at the limited degree to which he could practically implement his ideas. As Bruce himself would concede in later life, he was overly ambitious by nature and [...] "forever <b>buying</b> <b>into</b> things that aren't really my concern". But despite his lack of public recognition in Australia, peers and historians have long recognised the abiding impact Bruce had both {{as prime minister}} and internationalist, leading his successor as Chancellor of the Australian National University Sir John Cockcroft to conclude in 1962 that Bruce was [...] "probably the outstanding Australian of our time". The Melbourne Sun agreed with the assessment, stating upon his death that Bruce was [...] "probably the least remembered but the most extraordinary of our Prime Ministers".|$|E
500|$|The other {{production}} credit on Raising Hell went to Run's brother, Russell Simmons; he ran Rush Artist Management, now Rush Communications, which {{as well as}} handling Run-D.M.C., managed the Beastie Boys, LL Cool J, Whodini and Public Enemy. Simmons also co-owned [...] Def Jam Recordings, an important new school label, with Rubin. Simmons rose with Def Jam {{to become one of}} the biggest moguls in rap, while Rubin claimed credit for introducing radio-friendly brevity and song structure to hip hop. Def Jam's first 12-inch release was the minimalist drum machine breakdown [...] "I Need A Beat" [...] by LL Cool J (1984). This was followed by [...] "I Can't Live Without My Radio" [...] (Def Jam, 1985), a loud, defiant declaration of public loyalty to his boom box which the New York Times in 1987 called [...] "quintessential rap in its directness, immediacy and assertion of self". Both were on his debut album for Def Jam, 1985's Radio ("Reduced by Rick Rubin", read the liner notes), which contained another minimalist b-boy classic with shards of rock guitar, [...] "Rock the Bells". Perhaps rock fan Rubin's natural protégés were the Beastie Boys, sampling AC/DC on their Rock Hard EP on Def Jam in 1984, and recording a Run-D.M.C. outtake and a heavy metal parody on their hugely commercially successful debut album Licensed To Ill (Def Jam, 1986). In 1987, Raising Hell surpassed three million units sold, and Licensed to Ill five million.

500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008–09 NHL season, Panthers head coach Peter DeBoer, who first saw Horton play at seven years old, said about his hopes for Horton, [...] "If I'm looking for guys to do more, he wouldn't be at the top of the list. If he can give us 30-plus, I'd be happy with Nathan. There's a group of guys {{underneath}} him that I think can make a lot bigger jumps than I need out of Nathan Horton goal-wise." [...] Horton was also moved from his position of right wing to centre before the season. After playing a few games at centre, Horton said, [...] "It's not as easy as wing. You can play wing and all you have to concentrate on is getting the puck and shooting it. At center, you have more responsibilities." [...] Against the Nashville Predators on November 1, Horton played in his 300th career game, but failed to record a point. On November 26, Horton suffered a deep cut in his leg after it was stepped on by a skate. At the time of the injury, Horton had 6 goals and 7 assists. In early December, the Ottawa Sun reported that the Panthers might have been looking to trade Horton after he was reportedly unhappy playing for the team. Horton returned to the lineup on December 17 after missing eight games. After the game, Horton commented, [...] "I'm excited to play. It's kind of a different Panthers team than the past. It's really changed in a matter of a month. Things are going good now, and everybody's really <b>buying</b> <b>into</b> what Pete has been telling us all year." [...] On January 17, Horton recorded 3 assists to help the Panthers defeat Tampa Bay, 43. For the second time during the season, Horton's name came up in trade rumours, this time with the Chicago Blackhawks. In early March, days after the trade deadline, Horton suffered a finger injury that forced him to have surgery. He returned to the lineup on March 23, recording an assist in a Panthers loss to the Carolina Hurricanes. Horton ended the season with 22 goals and 23 assists in 67 games.|$|E
