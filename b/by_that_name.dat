5|$|The {{archaeological site}} and tourist {{attraction}} of Mixco Viejo {{was named after}} being erroneously associated with the Postclassic Poqomam capital referred to in colonial records <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>name.</b> The archaeological site has now been identified as Jilotepeque Viejo, {{the capital of the}} Chajoma Kaqchikel kingdom. To distinguish between the two, the ruins of the Chajoma capital are now referred to as Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo) while the former Poqomam capital is referred to as Mixco Viejo (Chinautla Viejo).|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} Diolkos at Corinth, there is scant {{literary}} evidence {{for two more}} ship trackways <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>name</b> in antiquity, both in Roman Egypt: The physician Oribasius (c. 320–400AD) records two passages from his 1st centuryAD colleague Xenocrates, in which the latter casually refers to a diolkos close to the harbor of Alexandria {{which may have been}} located at the southern tip of the island of Pharos. Another diolkos is mentioned by Ptolemy (90–168AD) in his book on geography (IV, 5, 10) as connecting a false mouth of a partly silted up Nile branch with the Mediterranean Sea. Neither Xenocrates nor Ptolemy offers any details on his trackway.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of conquest, polities in the {{northern}} Yucatán peninsula included Mani, Cehpech and Chakan; further east along the north coast were Ah Kin Chel, Cupul, and Chikinchel. Ecab, Uaymil, Chetumal all bordered on the Caribbean Sea. Cochuah {{was also in the}} eastern half of the peninsula. Tases, Hocaba and Sotuta were all landlocked provinces. Chanputun (modern Champotón) was on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, as was Acalan. In the southern portion of the peninsula, a number of polities occupied the Petén Basin. The Kejache occupied a territory between the Petén lakes and what is now Campeche. The Cholan Maya-speaking Lakandon (not {{to be confused with the}} modern inhabitants of Chiapas <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>name)</b> controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning eastern Chiapas and southwestern Petén. The Lakandon had a fierce reputation amongst the Spanish.|$|E

5|$|Despite his severe manner Stevenson was {{extremely}} sociable, {{and he was}} often the centre of a lively crowd at the bar of the Garrick Club, {{of which he was}} a member. His home on the Sussex coast was called Truncheons, sometimes taken to reflect his authoritarian views, but the area had been known <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>name</b> for many years before his arrival. Following his retirement Stevenson called for the restoration of the death penalty for all murders, and made frequent guest appearances on television until his health and eyesight began to fail. Among the programmes he took part in was Granada Television's six-part series The Bounds of Freedom, broadcast in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{was arrested}} {{when he arrived}} at Changi Airport on the evening of 19 March 1995 and {{produced}} a passport with his assumed name, Simon Davis. Police had put the name on their wanted list on 14 March after they determined that Lowe had checked into River View Hotel with someone <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>name.</b> In a police interview room in the airport, Martin smashed a glass panel and cut his wrist with a shard of glass in a suicide attempt, fearing that he would be hanged like Flor Contemplacion, a Filipino who had been hanged two days before for a double murder. He was taken to Alexandra Hospital for treatment.|$|E
5|$|The club {{began in}} 1883 as the Ottawa Hockey Club and was known <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>name</b> officially, even after joining the Ottawa Amateur Athletic Association (OAAA). Reports {{of the club}} in early play in the 1890s {{sometimes}} refer to the club as the Generals. The club is {{also referred to as}} the Capitals, although there was a competing Capital Athletic Association hockey team using that name. Other nicknames included the Silver Seven, a name the players gave themselves after receiving silver nuggets from manager Bob Shillington after the 1903 Stanley Cup win. The Super Six name was given in the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|On April 18, 1831, an {{institution}} was established, {{with the support}} of a group of prominent New York City residents from the city's merchants, bankers, and traders. Albert Gallatin was elected as the institution's first president. On April 21, 1831, the new institution received its charter and was incorporated as the University of the City of New York by the New York State Legislature; older documents often refer to it <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>name.</b> The university has been popularly known as New York University since its inception and was officially renamed New York University in 1896. In 1832, NYU held its first classes in rented rooms of four-story Clinton Hall, situated near City Hall. In 1835, the School of Law, NYU's first professional school, was established. Although the impetus to found a new school was partly a reaction by evangelical Presbyterians to what they perceived as the Episcopalianism of Columbia College, NYU was created non-denominational, unlike many American colleges at the time. American Chemical Society was founded in 1876 at NYU.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia's major {{industries}} {{of the era}} were the Baldwin Locomotive Works, William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Company, and the Pennsylvania Railroad. Westward expansion of the Pennsylvania Railroad helped Philadelphia keep up with nearby New York City in domestic commerce, as both cities fought for dominance in transporting iron and coal resources from Pennsylvania. Philadelphia's other local railroad was the Reading Railroad, but {{after a series of}} bankruptcies, it was taken over by New Yorkers. The Panic of 1873, which occurred when the New York City branch of the Philadelphia bank Jay Cooke and Company failed, and another panic in the 1890s hampered Philadelphia's economic growth. While the depressions hurt the city, its diverse array of industries helped it weather difficult times. It had numerous iron and steel-related manufacturers, including Philadelphian-owned iron and steel works outside the city, most notably the Bethlehem Iron Company in the city <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>name.</b> The largest industry in Philadelphia was textiles. Philadelphia produced more textiles than any other U.S. city; in 1904 the textile industry employed more than 35 percent of the city's workers. The cigar, sugar, and oil industries also were strong in the city. During this time the major department stores: Wanamaker's, Gimbels, Strawbridge and Clothier, and Lit Brothers, were developed along Market Street.|$|E
5|$|The Kejache {{occupied}} a territory {{to the north}} of the Itza, between the lakes and what is now Campeche. To the west of them was Acalan, inhabited by a Chontal Maya-speaking group with their capital in the south of what is now Campeche state. The Ch'olan Maya-speaking Lakandon (not to be confused with the modern inhabitants of Chiapas <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>name)</b> controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning southwestern Petén in Guatemala and eastern Chiapas. The Lakandon had a fierce reputation among the Spanish. The Xocmo were another Ch'olan-speaking group; they occupied the remote forest somewhere to the east of the Lakandon. Never conquered, the Xocmo escaped repeated Spanish attempts to locate them and their eventual fate is unknown; they may be ancestors of the modern Lacandon people. The Manche Ch'ol held territory in the extreme south of what is now the Petén department. The Mopan and the Chinamita had their polities in the southeastern Petén. The Manche territory was to the southwest of the Mopan.|$|E

5|$|The central {{highlands}} {{were occupied}} {{by a number of}} Maya peoples, including the Tzotzil, who were divided into a number of provinces; the province of Chamula was said to have five small towns grouped closely together. The Tojolabal were another Maya people, with territory around Comitán. The Coxoh Maya held territory in {{the upper reaches of the}} Grijalva drainage, near the Guatemalan border, and were probably a subgroup of the Tojolabal. Soconusco was an important communication route between the central Mexican highlands and Central America. It had been subjugated by the Aztec Triple Alliance at the end of the 15th century, under the emperor Ahuizotl, and paid tribute in cacao. The Cholan Maya-speaking Lakandon (not to be confused with the modern inhabitants of Chiapas <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>name)</b> controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning eastern Chiapas and southwestern Petén in Guatemala. The Lakandon had a fierce reputation amongst the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of conquest, polities in the north {{included}} Mani, Cehpech and Chakan. Chakan was largely landlocked with a small stretch of coast on {{the north of the}} peninsula. Cehpech was a coastal province to its east; further east along the north coast were Ah Kin Chel, Cupul, and Chikinchel. The modern city of Valladolid is situated upon the site of the former capital of Cupul. Cupul and Chinkinchel are known to have been mutually hostile, and to have engaged in wars to control the salt beds of the north coast. Tases was a small landlocked province south of Chikinchel. Ecab was a large province in the east. Uaymil was in the southeast, and Chetumal was to the south of it; all three bordered on the Caribbean Sea. Cochuah was also in the eastern half of the peninsula; it was southwest of Ecab and northwest of Uaymil. Its borders are poorly understood and it may have been landlocked, or have extended to occupy a portion of the Caribbean coast between the latter two kuchkabaloob. The capital of Cochuah was Tihosuco. Hocaba and Sotuta were landlocked provinces north of Mani and southwest of Ah Kin Chel and Cupul. Ah Canul was the northernmost province on the Gulf coast of the peninsula. Canpech (modern Campeche) was to the south of it, followed by Chanputun (modern Champotón). South of Chanputun, and extending west along the Gulf coast was Acalan. This Chontal Maya-speaking province extended east of the Usumacinta River in Tabasco, as far as what is now the southern portion of Campeche state, where their capital was located. In the southern portion of the peninsula, a number of polities occupied the Petén Basin. The Kejache occupied a territory {{to the north of the}} Itza and east of Acalan, between the Petén lakes and what is now Campeche, and to the west of Chetumal. The Cholan Maya-speaking Lakandon (not to be confused with the modern inhabitants of Chiapas <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>name)</b> controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning southwestern Petén in Guatemala and eastern Chiapas. The Lakandon had a fierce reputation amongst the Spanish.|$|E
