40|$|This study {{investigated}} the increase of <b>beta-damascenone</b> content during aging {{in a variety of}} commercial Belgian beers. Quantities detected in fresh beers were generally low (from 6 ng/g to 25 ng/g). After 5 days at 40 degrees C, the level increased (to as much as 210 ng/g) in most of the beers studied, according to the type of beer. Further experiments showed that wort initially contains large quantities of <b>beta-damascenone</b> (450 ng/g), but that degradation of the compound during fermentation accounts for the low concentrations observed in fresh beers. Production during beer aging can be partially explained by acid hydrolysis of glycosides...|$|E

Mechanistic studies revealed that C(sp(3)) -H bond activation in the hydrocarbon was the turnover-limiting step and the in-situ formed [Co(III) ]Ot-Bu did not engage in hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) of a C H bond.

40|$|Flavor {{quality is}} of major {{importance}} to the consumer, but the flavor characteristics of beer appear to deteriorate greatly with time, at a rate depending on {{the composition of the}} beer and its storage conditions (notably pH). Prior to identifying the influence of pH {{on the development of the}} most intense staling flavors found in aged lager beers, the corresponding key flavor compounds were determined by aroma extract dilution analysis. In addition to trans- 2 -nonenal, <b>beta-damascenone</b> seems at least as important in the flavor of aged beer. Ethyl butyrate, dimethyl trisulfide, 2 -acetylpyrazine, 3 -(methylthio) propionaldehyde, 2 -methoxypyrazine, maltol, gamma-nonalactone, and ethyl cinnamate are also relevant to the sensory profile of aged beer. Upon aging, a beer having a higher pH produces less <b>beta-damascenone,</b> because acid-catalyzed glycoside hydrolysis is decreased. On the other hand, it produces more 3 -(methylthio) propionaldehyde, owing to Strecker degradation of methionine. Raising the beer pH additionally causes the release of 3 -(methylthio) propionaldehyde from sulfitic adducts. These adducts, more stable at a lower pH, protect the aldehyde against premature oxidation to 3 -(methylthio) propionic acid, thus making it available for dimethyl trisulfide formation during aging...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{investigate}} Sauternes wine aromas. In all wine extracts, polyfunctional thiols were revealed to have a huge impact. A very strong bacon-petroleum odor emerged at RI = 845 from a CP-Sil 5 -CB column. Two thiols proved {{to participate in this}} perception: 3 -methyl- 3 -sulfanylbutanal and 2 -methylfuran- 3 -thiol. A strong synergetic effect was evidenced between the two compounds. The former, never mentioned before in wines, and not found in the musts of this study, is most probably synthesized during fermentation. 3 -Methylbut- 2 -ene- 1 -thiol, 3 -sulfanylpropyl acetate, 3 -sulfanylhexan- 1 -ol, and 3 -sulfanylheptanal also contribute to the global aromas of Sauternes wines. Among other key odorants, the presence of a varietal aroma (alpha-terpineol), sotolon, fermentation alcohols (3 -methylbutan- 1 -ol and 2 -phenylethanol) and esters (ethyl butyrate, ethyl hexanoate, and ethyl isovalerate), carbonyls (trans-non- 2 -enal and <b>beta-damascenone),</b> and wood flavors (guaiacol, vanillin, eugenol, beta-methyl-gamma-octalactone, and Furaneol) is worth stressing...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} 26 staling {{compounds}} on the aged flavour of a Belgian lager beer was studied. Strikingly, thresholds were regularly {{found to be}} substantially lower than those previously reported, and it appeared important to consider threshold values as indicative rather than absolute because of very large variations in sensitivity of individuals. In addition, a masking effect of isoamyl acetate and various interactions were observed between flavour compounds, which can considerably influence their flavour activity, even at sub-threshold concentrations. Cardboard flavour was essentially caused by (E) - 2 -nonenal. Additionally, methional, 3 -methylbutanal, 2 -furfuryl ethyl ether, <b>beta-damascenone</b> and acetaldehyde were confirmed as key contributors to the aged flavour {{and to a lesser}} extent, (E,E) - 2, 4 -decadienal, phenylacetaldehyde, 2 -methylpropanal, diacetyl and 5 -hydroxymethyfurfural. Finally, the addition of a selection of compounds could fairly well reproduce the flavour of aged lager beer, indicating that these compounds account for the major part of this flavour.

The frontier orbitals and molecular electrostatic potential surface study has also been employed to understand the active sites of title compounds. The calculation of the IR spectra is not only important in order to confirm the validity of the simulations but it also allows additional insight into the molecular level of the system not accessible from experiment. Therefore, simulated IR and Raman spectra of the title compounds are also presented in this study.

40|$|Abstract The {{differences}} among young wines from berries at 3 heights (fruit-zone 1 (FZ 1) : 140 - 200 cm above the ground; FZ 2 : 80 - 140 cm; FZ 3 : 20 - 80 cm) on Vitis vinifera L. cv Merlot and Chardonnay were assessed {{to evaluate the}} influence of berry-heights on the final wine quality. Stir bar sorptive extraction coupled with gas chromatography&# 8211;mass spectrometry (SBSE-GC/MS) was used to analyse the characteristics of wine aromas. The results revealed that berry-heights exert significant influence on ethyl octanoate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, and ethyl butanoate in various- FZ Merlot wines and <b>beta-damascenone</b> in the Chardonnay -FZ wines. As a result, FZ 1 wines of Merlot are more aromatic than the other FZ wines and had the highest floral and fruity series intensity. For the Chardonnay wines, fruity and sweet series were highly intense in the FZ 1 wines. The PCA results demonstrated {{a high degree of}} differences in the aroma of various- FZ wines of the 2 grape cultivars, especially the Merlot variety, which indicates a need to separate the berries from the different- FZs. These results suggest that wineries should consider the possibility of separating berries from different-heights to produce wines of distinctive quality. Furthermore, this knowledge about the volatile composition of young wines offers a means of evaluating the aroma potential of wines from berries taking into account their position along the vines...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{revealed}} {{the importance of}} polyfunctional thiols in young Sauternes wines, but very little is yet known {{about the fate of}} such compounds during aging in the bottle. In this study, two Sauternes wines were investigated by gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and gas chromatography-pulsed flame photometric detector (GC-PFPD) after XAD 2 and thiol-specific extractions. Most polyfunctional thiols (3 -sulfanylpropyl acetate, 2 -sulfanylethyl acetate, 3 -methyl- 3 -sulfanylbutanal, etc.) proved to be completely degraded after 2 years of bottle aging in a cellar. Only 3 -sulfanylhexan- 1 -ol was still found in aged samples at concentrations above its threshold value. Most other key odorants found in the young noble rot wine were still detected 5 - 6 years after harvest: varietal aroma (alpha-terpineol), sotolon, fermentation alcohols (3 -methylbutan- 1 -ol and 2 -phenylethanol) and esters (ethyl butyrate, isobutyrate, hexanoate, and isovalerate), and oak maturation-related compounds (guaiacol, vanillin, eugenol, <b>beta-damascenone,</b> trans-non- 2 -enal, beta-methyl-gamma-octalactone, gamma-nonalactone, and furaneol), as well as three newly identified aromas exhibiting interesting cake, honey-like, and dried apricot odors: homofuraneol, theaspirane, and gamma-decalactone. Interestingly, abhexon, never mentioned in sweet wines before, was found to be synthesized during bottle aging. An optimized extraction method allowed us to quantify this honey/spicy compound at levels close to its threshold value (up to 7 mug/L after 5 - 6 years), thus suggesting a key role of this strong odorant in old Sauternes wines...|$|E
40|$|The {{quantitative}} determination of volatile compounds of Chardonnay wines using HS-SPME-GC × GC/TOFMS {{along with the}} determination of odor activity value (OAV) and relative odor contribution (ROC) of volatiles are reported for the first time. The use of GC × GC/TOFMS {{for the analysis of}} Chardonnay wine of Serra Gaucha resulted in the tentative identification of 243 compounds, showing the superior performance of this analytical technique for this specific varietal wine, considering that the number of compounds usually separated by 1 D-GC for this type of wine is lower. Furthermore, 42 compounds co-eluted in the first dimension and 34 of them were separated in the second dimension, while the others were resolved by spectral deconvolution (8), which indicates that the conventional 1 D-GC/MS may result in misleading results. The calculation of OAV and ROC allowed the determination of the volatile compounds that presented the greater contribution to wine aroma. Ethyl octanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl butanoate, and <b>beta-damascenone</b> showed the highest OAV and ROC values, although other 43 compounds showed also potential to contribute to wine aroma. Figures of merit of the developed method were: accuracies from 92. 4 to 102. 6 %, repeatability from 1. 2 % to 13. 4 %, LOD from 0. 001 ?g L? 1 (ethyl isovalerate and hexanoic acid) to 2. 554 ?g L? 1 (ethyl 3 -hydroxybutanoate), LOQ from 0. 003 ?g L? 1 (ethyl isovalerate and hexanoic acid) to 7. 582 ?g L? 1 (ethyl 3 -hydroxybutanoate). 2014 DOI 10. 1016 /j. foodres. 2014. 02. 00...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2007 American Chemical SocietyThe {{influence}} of irrigation strategy on grape berry carotenoids and C 13 -norisoprenoid precursors was investigated for Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon. Two irrigation treatments were compared, {{one in which}} vines received reduced irrigation applied alternately {{to either side of}} the vine (partial rootzone drying, PRD) and a second control treatment in which water was applied to both sides of the vine. Over the two years of the experiments, PRD vines received on average 66 % of the water applied to the controls. Initially, the PRD treatment did not alter midday leaf (psiL) and stem (psiS) water potential relative to the control, but decreased stomatal conductance (gs). Continued exposure to the PRD treatment resulted in treated grapevines experiencing hydraulic water deficit relative to the control treatment and induced lowered midday psiL and psiS, which was also reflected in decreased berry weight at harvest. In both irrigation treatments, the most abundant grape berry carotenoids, beta-carotene and lutein, followed the developmental pattern typical of other grape varieties, decreasing post-veraison. At certain points in time, as the fruit approached maturity, the concentration of these carotenoids was increased in fruit of PRD-treated vines relative to the controls. This effect was greater for lutein than for beta-carotene. PRD consistently caused increases in the concentration of hydrolytically released C 13 -norisoprenoids <b>beta-damascenone,</b> beta-ionone, and 1, 1, 6 -trimethyl- 1, 2 -dihydronaphthalene in fruit at harvest (24 degrees Brix) over two seasons. The effect of the PRD treatment on the concentration of hydrolytically released C 13 -norisoprenoids was greater in the second of the two seasons of the experiment and was also reflected in an increase in total C 13 -norisoprenoid content per berry. This suggests that the increases in the concentration of the C 13 -norisoprenoids in response to PRD were independent of water deficit induced changes in berry size and were not the result of an altered berry surface area to volume ratio.

40|$|Different beers with {{intensive}} hop {{additions to}} achieve a hop bouquet were aged for up to 700 days at 20 °C and 30 °C and {{the behavior of the}} hop aroma substances was examined, based on low oxygen bottling and the use of scavenger crown corks. Special attention was paid to the linalool, which produced the following results in summary: - the stereoisomers R-linalool and S-linalool are observed separately, because R-linalool is much more sensorily active than S-linalool - R-linalool as %-rel. of total linalool decreases about 30 % per year at 20 °C, S-linalool increases about 150 % per year - The R-linalool decreases from 90 % in fresh beer to 75 % within one year at 20 °C - Influences from the type of hopping (for example in the wort or dry hopping) or the type of beer (for example bottom fermenting or top fermenting) were not noticeable - Since R-linalool is sensorily much more active than S-linalool, the decrease in R-linalool plays a decisive role. Just the analysis of total linalool is not sufficient to describe sensory effects. The behavior of other aroma substances during storage at 20 °C can be defined as follows: - Monoterpenes were surprisingly stable; the sesquiterpenes too suffered only slight losses - Some carboxylic esters are relatively stable, the majority decreased by 12 and 20 % per 100 days at 20 °C - Of the monoterpene alcohols R-linalool decreased significantly, nerol and geraniol behaved differently, whereas alpha-terpineol and 1 -terpinen- 4 -ol increased - The oxidized sesquiterpenes decreased slightly - <b>Beta-damascenone</b> and 2 terpene ethers increased significantly The examinations did not include sensory assesment. Obviously the decrease in R-linalool leads to less hoppy-floral notes and the loss of some esters means less fruity notes. Overall the hop aroma substances proved to be more stable than presumed. A hop aroma in the beer will change during beer aging but will not completely disappear depending on the original impact. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Ikigage is a Rwandese {{traditional}} beer {{made from}} sorghum malt and local plants, mainly Vernonia amygdalina “umubirizi”. However, this beer remains less attractive than Western beers of pils type {{because of poor}} hygienic quality, variations of organoleptic quality and limited shelf life. The aim of this work is to characterize ikigage beer {{in order to improve}} its hygienic quality and to reduce the organoleptic variations using the local raw materials. The first part of our study shows that ikigage beer marketed in Rwanda is characterized by the presence of Stapylococcus aureus and many micro-organisms of fecal origin (Escherichia coli and fecal streptococci), by the low ethanol content, high total acidity and an important amounts of proteins. The yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Issatckenkia orientalis), followed by the lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus buchneri), are the predominant microorganisms involved in fermentation of ikigage beer fermentation. Besides, one of the major problems in sorghum beer brewing is the efficient conversion of the starch extracts into fermentable sugars due to the weak activity of β-amylase in sorghum malt. The use of Eleusine coracana “uburo” (Musama variety) malt (30 %), associated with mashing decantation procedure, increases the content of sugar fermentable, maltose particularly, in sorghum wort, and consequently ethanol content in the beer. The second part of our study shows that V. amygdalina, known for its antibacterial properties and its bitterness similar to hops, contributes to the production of methyl salycilate, <b>beta-damascenone</b> and many terpenes compounds (δ- 3 -carene, β-farnesene, farnesol, β-citronellol and linalool), in the sorghum beer “ikigage”. This work reveals also the presence of 14 polyfunctional thiols in beers brewed with ‘non-Western’ raw materials. Among them, the well-known hop constituent 3 -methyl- 2 -buten- 1 -thiol emerged as a key flavour in the unhopped beers containing V. amygdalina. V. amygdalina also contributes to the production of 1 -butanethiol and 4 -sulfanyl- 4 -methyl- 2 -pentanone in sorghum beer. However, contrary to hops, V. amygdalina addition during boiling also appears to strongly inhibit the production of 2 -sulfanylethyl acetate. The third part of our study shows that the use of S. cerevisiae in combination with I. orientalis and L. fermentum as starter allows producing ikigage beer having the GRAS (generally recognized as safe) statute while preserving the organoleptic characteristics similar to those of local traditional beer “ikigage” produced by peasants...|$|E
40|$|The {{first step}} of odor {{perception}} is an interaction between odorants and olfactory receptors [1]. The corresponding transduced olfactory signals, conveyed by olfactory sensory neurons, are then processed by the brain [2]. It is now accepted that the main strategy used to discriminate thousands of odors results from a combinatorial coding [3]. Moreover, odors perceived in our environment are mainly the result of mixtures of odorants; however, the specific mechanisms involved in their processing remain poorly understood [4]. In previous studies performed in the CSGA of Dijon [5 - 7], we investigated the perception of a mixture of 6 components: vanillin, oxanone (4 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) butan- 2 -one), isoamyl acetate, beta-ionone, ethyl acetate, and <b>beta-damascenone.</b> We have shown that, at specific proportions, this mixture is configurally processed and perceived as different from its components and carries the specific odor of red cordial (blending RC mixture). Assuming that combinations of activated ORs encode odor qualities [8, 9], we used Common Feature Pharmacophore Generation protocol (Discovery Studio 4. 1, Biovia) to generate pharmacophore hypotheses [10]. The purpose is to identify whether molecular characteristics may be common to the molecules of the mixture, which would highlight that configural perception is linked to overlapping patterns of OR. In our study, the pharmacophoric features considered are hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) and hydrophobic regions (HY); {{the maximum number of}} generated hypothesis for each run was set to 10. The pharmacophores obtained by using the six molecules are built up of one HY and one HBA; this seems not very meaningful despite a satisfactory alignment of the molecular structures. Besides, we generated the pharmacophores for each molecule using its conformers as individual molecules (maximum 250 conformers in energy range 20 kcal/mol). By comparing the pharmacophores two by two, we identified a pair of molecules, vanillin and oxanone, whose pharmacophores possess some common characteristics 2 HBA located 8 Å from each other and 1 HY between those two. Interestingly, the basis of RC consists of a mixture of vanilla and red berries, while vanillin and oxanone carry respectively the notes “vanilla” and “raspberry”. These results suggest that a similar binding site could exist for at least the two molecules likely sharing key odor notes of the blending mixture. It thus supports the hypothesis that molecules involved in a mixture that elicits an emergent odor recognize a c ommon set of ORs. Bibliography [1] L. Buck, R. Axel Cell 65 (1991) 175 - 187. [2] D.
