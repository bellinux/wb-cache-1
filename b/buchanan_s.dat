Baeza (Spain), 23 - 25 September (2013) The {{regulation}} of ionic transport in plants is essential because it establishes the key physicochemical parameters for cell function. Under abiotic stress, the intracellular levels of pH, potassium (K+) and toxic cations, such as Na+, change and this affect multiple cellular systems. Consequently, {{the knowledge of}} the molecular mechanism that regulates the ionic transport is fundamental and provides opportunities to use plants to our benefit [1]. The plant cells use calcium-signaling pathways to activate certain ion channels providing the correct response to a particular stress situation. As the most abundant cation in a living plant cell, K+ is an essential ion for processes of growth, development, maintenance of turgor pressure, and plasma membrane polarization [2]. Plants living under low K+ conditions often adapt their K+ uptake through the CBL-CIPK calcium-signaling pathway, that mobilizes K+ uptake in roots [3]. Under K+ deficiency, a CBL calcium sensor activates a CIPK kinase [3] that in turn phosphorilates and activate the K+ channel. When K+ levels are restored, a phosphatase dephosphorilates and inactivates the channel (Fig. 1) [5]. We have carried out structural studies with the kinase domain and its binding partner, the interacting region of the K+ channel, to understand at molecular level how K+ uptake is regulated under stress conditions.

40|$|The cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), encoded by the gene mutated in {{cystic fibrosis}} patients, {{belongs to the}} family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins, but, unlike other members, functions as a chloride channel. CFTR is activated by protein kinase A (PKA) -mediated phosphorylation of multiple sites in its regulatory domain, and gated by binding and hydrolysis of ATP at its two nucleotide binding domains (NBD 1, NBD 2). The recent crystal structure of NBD 1 from mouse CFTR (Lewis, H. A., S. G. <b>Buchanan,</b> <b>S.</b> K. Burley, K. Conners, M. Dickey, M. Dorwart, R. Fowler, X. Gao, W. B. Guggino, W. A. Hendrickson, et al. 2004. EMBO J. 23 : 282 – 293) identified two regions absent from structures of all other NBDs determined so far, a “regulatory insertion” (residues 404 – 435) and a “regulatory extension” (residues 639 – 670), both positioned to impede formation of the putative NBD 1 –NBD 2 dimer anticipated to occur during channel gating; as both segments appeared highly mobile and both contained consensus PKA sites (serine 422, and serines 660 and 670, respectively), it was suggested that their phosphorylation-linked conformational changes might underlie CFTR channel regulation. To test that suggestion, we coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes CFTR residues 1 – 414 with residues 433 – 1480, or residues 1 – 633 with 668 – 1480, to yield split CFTR channels (called 414 + 433 and 633 + 668) that lack most of the insertion, or extension, respectively. In excised patches, regulation of the resulting CFTR channels by PKA and by ATP was largely normal. Both 414 + 433 channels and 633 + 668 channels, as well as 633 (S 422 A) + 668 channels (lacking both the extension and the sole PKA consensus site in the insertion), were all shut during exposure to MgATP before addition of PKA, but activated like wild type (WT) upon phosphorylation; this indicates that inhibitory regulation of nonphosphorylated WT channels depends upon neither segment. Detailed kinetic analysis of 414 + 433 channels revealed intact ATP dependence of single-channel gating kinetics, but slightly shortened open bursts and faster closing from the locked-open state (elicited by ATP plus pyrophosphate or ATP plus AMPPNP). In contrast, 633 + 668 channel function was indistinguishable from WT at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. We conclude that neither nonconserved segment is an essential element of PKA- or nucleotide-dependent regulation...|$|E

40|$|Lectin-like bacteriocins are {{antibacterial}} proteins constituted of two structurally similar monocot {{mannose-binding lectin}} (MMBL) domains, and {{are followed by}} a short C-terminal extension. These so-called LlpA bacteriocins have been characterized in strains of Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas and Burkholderia, and display highly specific intra-genus activity [1]. In contrast to typical Gram-negative bacteriocins (such as Escherichia coli colicins or Pseudomonas aeruginosa	 S-type pyocins), LlpAs do not require a cognate immunity protein [1, 2]. These antibacterials are retrieved in soil-dwelling and plant-associated isolates, but are not widely distributed in these populations. Recently it was demonstrated that {{only one of the}} MMBL modules of LlpAs displays sugar-binding properties. Interestingly, LlpAs seem to prefer D-rhamnose over D-mannose. The latter property enables the use of D-rhamnose-containing lipopolysaccharide as a cellular receptor, presumably for initial attachment of the bacteriocin to the outer membrane of a target cell. In contrast, the other MMBL domain of the LlpAs serves a role as a target strain specificity determinant. Presence of both lectin modules is mandatory to obtain a fully active antibacterial molecule [3, 4], but the actual killing mechanism of lectin-like bacteriocins remains unknown. We identified two highly-divergent groups of lectin-like bacteriocin genes in recently sequenced Pseudomonas aeruginosa genomes. The encoded proteins show only borderline sequence homology to previously identified LlpAs. Recombinant His-tagged proteins, purified via affinity chromatography, were tested against a large panel of Pseudomonas isolates and other Gram-negative bacteria. Antagonistic interactions were detected solely against P. aeruginosa strains. In addition to environmental isolates, these L pyocins also targeted multidrug-resistant clinical isolates, with minimum inhibitory concentrations down to the nanomolar range. Spectrum overlap between close homologues belonging to one of the L pyocin groups was only minimal. This is in contrast to the spectral redundancy that was observed for LlpAs in other Pseudomonas species. Residues differing between these close homologues, potentially responsible for the spectrum differences observed, were mapped on the L pyocin 3 D-structure [4], and appeared to mainly cluster in the domain lacking D-rhamnose binding capacity. We found no correlation between susceptibility to L pyocins and phylogenetic relatedness of the P. aeruginosa isolates, suggesting that a highly variable characteristic is responsible for the spectrum differences observed. Out of 15 O serotypes tested, 13 contained L pyocin susceptible strains, excluding the possibility that the highly variable and immunogenic O serotype antigen of the LPS coating would represent a susceptibility-discriminating factor [5].

Asa was a Texas oil baron millionaire {{who had a}} love-hate relationship with his sons, and practically everyone he knew. The Buchanan clan was an obvious attempt to imitate the then wildly popular prime-time soap Dallas, but the Buchanans proved to be such big hits that they soon dominated the entire show. Most of the Wolek and Lord family members who anchored OLTL since its inception were written out, or (in the case of Viki) married into the Buchanan family. (Ironically the Buchanan family has remained a popular fixture on the daytime soap to this day, outlasting their inspirations on Dallas {{by more than a}} decade.) Asa was as much a scoundrel as J.R.

40|$|Higginson, Jill <b>S.</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> Thomas <b>S.</b> In the United States, {{approximately}} 795, 000 {{adults are}} affected by a stroke per year and stroke {{is the leading cause}} of adult long term disability. Individuals who have suffered a stroke are often limited in performing many daily functional tasks, especially walking. Therefore, the primary goal of individuals during post-stroke rehabilitation is to regain their ability to walk. Following stroke, muscle weakness contralateral to the brain lesion, or hemiparesis, is the most common impairment. However, it is unclear whether post-stroke muscle weakness is solely due to neurological impairment following stroke, or whether changes in muscle architecture are additional contributing factors. In Aim 1, changes in muscle morphology (i. e. muscle volume, fascicle length and pennation angle) for individual post-stroke dorsiflexor and plantar flexor muscles were quantified using magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound. The findings indicate that 1) dorsiflexor weakness is not due to changes in muscle architecture and is most likely due to neurological impairments and 2) while individual plantar flexor muscles are affected differently post-stroke, the relative contribution to plantar flexor torque remains the same. Slow walking speed is common for many stroke survivors, and overall function and quality of life improves as walking speed is able to be increased. Therefore, understanding potential factors that may limit speed progression and determining what compensatory mechanisms are utilized to achieve faster walking speeds is important for developing speed-related rehabilitation techniques. In Aim 2, a novel multi-joint hybrid method that utilizes the strengths of both EMG-driven and computed muscle control methods to estimate muscle activations and forces has been developed. Using this method, we found that faster ambulators tended to use a wider range of available hip muscle functions (e. g. abduction and adduction), which was manifested in a circumduction strategy that was mostly regulated by the hip flexors and gluteals. Recent developments in musculoskeletal modeling and computer simulation techniques have enabled the estimation of muscle forces during dynamic tasks and provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of different movement strategies. However, these techniques have been primarily used to describe what does occur rather than predicting what could occur as a result of rehabilitation. In Aim 3, forward dynamic simulations were used to predict the sagittal kinematics during dorsiflexor and plantar flexor functional electrical stimulation (FES) during post-stroke gait. These simulations confirmed that our models have the potential to investigate therapeutic interventions, and also provided the much needed foundation for future research using simulations to predict novel rehabilitation interventions.

5000|$|In December 2006, one of Vincent's {{properties}} {{is burned}} down, and police commissioner Bo <b>Buchanan</b> (Robert <b>S.</b> Woods) confirms {{it to be}} arson. After two more properties burn, Vincent accuses Cristian, believing Cristian was looking for revenge from the boxing incident. After another arson attacks against Hispanic Cristian and Jewish district attorney Nora, the arsons are revealed to have been committed by white supremacist group called [...] "One Pure People". Kirk Harmon (Randolph Mantooth) confesses to the crimes but only to protect son and former baseball player Tate Harmon. Natalie asks Vincent {{out on a date}} when she and John are on the outs, but he turned her down because he and Layla were on the road to reconciliation. In July 2007, plans further attacks against Vincent, Layla, and Adriana Cramer (Melissa Fumero). After Vincent plans a romantic dinner for himself and Layla on The Palace Hotel rooftop, Tate sneaks up and knocks Vincent over the head with a baseball bat. Layla arrived and found Vincent knocked out and tied to a chair. Soon enough, Adriana calls Layla and Tate answers, ordering Adriana to come to the rooftop alone. Adriana keeps the assault from fiancé Rex Balsom (John-Paul Lavoisier) and Talia Sahid (BethAnn Bonner). Rex follows Adriana, and Tate orders Adriana to tie up Rex. Talia receives a tip from the hotel owner, Renée Divine Buchanan (Patricia Elliott), and rescues Vincent, Layla, Adriana, and Rex. Vincent and Layla reunite and have sex for the first time. Tate is sent to prison.|$|R
