40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to induce {{synchronized}} estrus by short-term progestagen treatments plus PMSG at nulliparous ewes from the breed Synthetic Population <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Milk</b> at the beginning of the estrus season. The experiment was carried out with 30 ewes, divided in 3 groups (each group – n= 10). I group – vaginal sponge impregnated with 30 mg FGA for six days, as at the time of the placement of the sponge 125 µg cloprostenolum was put i. m. At the time of the removal of the sponge, 300 UI PMSG was put i. m.; II group – the same as the I group, but without cloprostenolum treatment; III group – control. The applied schemes had good synchronized effect, but low fertility (90 % and 66, 67 %, 22, 22 % and 33, 33 respectively for Group I and Group II) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim {{of present}} study was to {{investigate}} the polymorphism of calpastatin and myostatin genes in sheep from Synthetic Population <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Milk</b> (SPBM) breed because they are considered as candidate genes for meat and growth traits. Blood samples were collected from 121 sheep represented SPBM and genomic DNA was extracted using commercial purification kit. Genotypes were determined by PCR amplification followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. Based on results, calpastatin gene was found to be polymorphic but myostatin gene was monomorphic. The allelic frequencies in CAST gene were 92 % for allele M and 8 % for N. Genotype frequencies were 84 %, 15 % and 1 % for MM, MN and NN in calpastatin locus, respectively. In this population, calpastatin locus did not show Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P< 0. 05). Observed heterozygosity for this locus was 0. 148. Established polymorphism of CAST gene in SPBM sheep can be used in future research for detection of possible association between effective genotype and meat tenderness...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the pregnancy rate (PR) in goats with natural and synchronized estrus after artificial insemination (AI) by frozen semen during breeding season. Methods: The experiment {{was carried out}} with 89 <b>Bulgarian</b> White <b>milk</b> goats divided as follows: group I (n =  54) animals with natural estrus (NE), allocated in two subgroups treated with or not with GnRH after the last insemination and group II (n =  35) goats with synchronized estrus by intravaginal sponges and injection of PMSG after the sponges withdrawal. Both groups were also divided according to number AI – single or double. All animals in group I were inseminated by frozen semen after proved standing estrus {{as a part of}} goats received second insemination 8  h later. Single insemination in synchronized goats was done 48 and double at 48 and 56  h after the sponge removal. Ultrasound pregnancy diagnosis was performed on day 30 post insemination. Results: The pregnant animals in both subgroups with natural estrus and single AI (33. 3 % and 45. 2 %) were less than those (58. 3 %) after estrus synchronization (ES). The pregnancy rate in synchronized goats with double insemination was 63. 6 %, whereas in animals with natural estrus varied from 40  to 50 %. Overall pregnancy rate in group I (60 %) was significantly (P <  0. 05) higher than (37 %) in goats without GnRH treatment. Conclusion: The goats with natural estrus and GnRH treatment tend to enhance pregnancy rate after double artificial insemination 8  h apart. The insemination number has no significant impact on pregnancy rate in synchronized goats as the overall pregnancy rate is better than in animals with natural estrus without GnRH administration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. During 2013 – 2015 on pellic {{vertisol}} {{soil type}} was conducted a field experiment. Under investigation was <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>milk</b> thistle cultivar Silmar (Silybum marianum Gaertn.). Factor A included {{the years of}} investigation. Factor B included no treated check, 6 soil-applied herbicides – Tendar EC, Sharpen 33 EC, Merlin flex 480 SC, Smerch 24 ЕC, Raft 400 SC, Eagle 75 DF and 5 foliar-applied herbicides – Kalin flo, Eclipse 70 DWG, Sultan 500 SC, Granstar super 50 SG, Starane 250 EK. Factor C included no treated check and 1 antigraminaceous herbicide – Tiger platinium 5 EC. All herbicides, herbicide combinations and herbicide tank-mixtures were applied in a working solution of 200 l/ha. Mixing of foliar-applied herbicides {{was done in the}} tank on the sprayer. Soil-applied herbicides were treated during the period after sowing before emergence. Foliar-applied herbicides were treated during rosette stage of the milk thistle. Tank mixtures of antigraminaceous herbicide Tiger platinum with foliar herbicides Kalin flo, Eclipse, Sultan, Granstar super and Starane leads to obtaining high seed yields of milk thistle. High yields seeds are also obtained by foliar treatment with Tiger platinum after soil-applied herbicides Raft, Sharpen and Eagle. The use of the soil-applied herbicides Smerch, Merlin flex and Tendar does not increase the seed yield due to its higher phytotoxicity against milk thistle. Herbicide Tendar and herbicide combination Tendar + Tiger platinum are the most unstable, followed by herbicide Merlin flex. Herbicide tank-mixtures Kalin flo + Tiger platinum and Eclipse + Tiger platinum and herbicide combination Raft + Tiger platinum are technologically the most valuable. They combine high seed yield with high stability with relation to different years. Single application of soil-applied or foliar-applied herbicides have low estimate; due to that they must be combined for full control of weeds in milk thistle crops. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} 45 years the {{production}} of buffalo milk in the world increases with much higher rates compared with the cow milk. This {{is a result of}} the process of restructuring of the buffalo breeding towards production of milk and meat. In Bulgaria this restructuring ended with the full replacement of the aboriginal Bulgarian buffalo for work, milk and meat with the new breed Bulgarian Murrah, which possesses high productive qualities for milk and meat. It is used as a genetic source for improving the milk productivity in dozens of countries on the four continents of the world. In the next years, as a EU member, the national economy of Bulgaria will endure significant changes, which will influence positively the agrarian production and respectively the buffalo breeding. Therefore the view in the future of this perspective branch requires a profound analysis of the buffalo breeding, as well as the business environment, in which it will develop. Based on this analysis and the specific biological specifics, methodological and methodical conditions in the study, the development of the buffalo breeding in 2005 - 2020 is foreseen. Special place in it occupies {{the production of}} high quality tribal material for the domestic needs and the needs of the foreign markets. Suitable productive structure of acknowledged <b>Bulgarian</b> brands of <b>milk</b> and meat products with high VAT is mentioned. The tendencies and directions towards the perspective economi-organizational structures, technological changes and the increase of the incomes on the whole chain from the connected with the business of buffalo breeding activities are defined. Necessary attention is drawn to the contemporary requirements to the comfort of the animals, ecological purity of the final food products and the protection of the environment from pollutions. ...|$|R
