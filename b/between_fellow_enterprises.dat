40|$|Purpose: Previous {{studies of}} the visual outcome in {{bilateral}} non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) have yielded conflicting results, specifically regarding congruity <b>between</b> <b>fellow</b> eyes. Prior studies have used measures of acuity and computerized perimetry but none has compared Goldmann visual field outcomes <b>between</b> <b>fellow</b> eyes. In order to better define the concordance of visual loss in this condition, we reviewed our cases of bilateral sequential NAION, including measures of visual acuity, pupillary function and both pattern and severity of visual field loss. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 102 patients with a diagnosis of bilateral sequential NAION. Of the 102 patients, 86 {{were included in the}} study for analysis of final visual outcome between the affected eyes. Visual function was assessed using visual acuity, Goldmann visual fields, color vision and RAPD. A quantitative total visual field score and score per quadrant was analyzed for each eye using the numerical Goldmann visual field scoring method previously described by Esterman and colleagues. Based upon these scores, we calculated the total deviation and pattern deviation <b>between</b> <b>fellow</b> eyes and <b>between</b> eyes of different patients. Statistical significance was determined using nonparametric tests. Results: A statistically significant correlation was found <b>between</b> <b>fellow</b> eyes for multiple parameters, including logMAR visual acuity (P = 0. 0101), global visual field (P = 0. 0001), superior visual field (P = 0. 0001), and inferior visual field (P = 0. 0001). In addition, the mean deviation of both total (P = 0. 0000000007) and pattern (P = 0. 000000004) deviation analyses was significantly less <b>between</b> <b>fellow</b> eyes ("intra"-eyes) than between eyes of different patients ("inter"-eyes). Conclusions: Visual function <b>between</b> <b>fellow</b> eyes showed a fair to moderate correlation that was statistically significant. The pattern of vision loss was also more similar in <b>fellow</b> eyes than <b>between</b> eyes of different patients. These results may help allow better prediction of visual outcome for the second eye in patients with NAION. These findings may also be useful for evaluating efficacy of therapeutic interventions...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE To better {{define the}} {{concordance}} of visual loss {{in patients with}} nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). METHODS The medical records of 86 patients with bilateral sequential NAION were reviewed retrospectively, and visual function was assessed using visual acuity, Goldmann visual fields, color vision, and relative afferent papillary defect. A quantitative total visual field score and score per quadrant were analyzed for each eye using the numerical Goldmann visual field scoring method. RESULTS Outcome measures were visual acuity, visual field, color vision, and relative afferent papillary defect. A statistically significant correlation was found <b>between</b> <b>fellow</b> eyes for multiple parameters, including logMAR visual acuity (P = . 01), global visual field (P <. 001), superior visual field (P <. 001), and inferior visual field (P < . 001). The mean deviation of total (P < . 001) and pattern (P < . 001) deviation analyses was significantly less <b>between</b> <b>fellow</b> eyes than <b>between</b> first and second eyes of different patients. CONCLUSIONS Visual function <b>between</b> <b>fellow</b> eyes showed a fair to moderate correlation that was statistically significant. The pattern of vision loss was also more similar in <b>fellow</b> eyes than <b>between</b> eyes of different patients. These results may help allow better prediction of visual outcome for the second eye in patients with NAION...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the bilateral symmetry {{of the global}} corneal topography in normal corneas {{with a wide range}} of curvature, astigmatism and thickness values Design: Cross-Sectional Study Methods: Topography images were recorded for the anterior and posterior surfaces of 342 participants using a Pentacam. Elevation data were fitted to a general quadratic model that considered both translational and rotational displacements. Comparisons <b>between</b> <b>fellow</b> corneas of estimates of corneal shape parameters (elevation, radius in two main directions, Rx and Ry, and corresponding shape factors, Qx and Qy) and corneal position parameters (translational displacements: x 0, y 0 and z 0, and rotational displacements: a, b and c) were statistically analyzed. Results: The general quadratic model provided average RMS of fit errors with the topography data of 1. 760. 6 mm and 5. 761. 3 mm in anterior and posterior corneal surfaces. The comparisons showed highly significant bilateral correlations with the differences <b>between</b> <b>fellow</b> corneas in Rx, Ry, Qx and Qy of anterior and posterior surfaces remaining insignificantly different from zero. Bilateral differences in elevation measurements at randomly-selected points in both corneal central and peripheral areas indicated strong mirror symmetry <b>between</b> <b>fellow</b> corneas. The mean geometric center (x 0, y 0, z 0) of both right and left corneas was located on the temporal side and inferior-temporal side of the apex in anterior and posterio...|$|R
