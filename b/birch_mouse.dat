It was also in Jämtland that the beaver was reintroduced in Sweden from Norway in 1922. The current beaver population is quite large and common. Among the smaller mammals inhabiting Jämtland that are rare {{in the rest of}} Scandinavia are e.g. the taiga shrew and the northern <b>birch</b> <b>mouse.</b> The læmel, Norway lemming is also present in Jämtland and the latest major population boom usual for this species occurred in 2001.|$|E

50|$|The Dipodidae, or dipodids, are {{a family}} of rodents found across the Northern Hemisphere, the sole family in the {{superfamily}} Dipodoidea. This family includes over 50 species among the 16 genera.They include the jerboas, jumping <b>mice,</b> and <b>birch</b> <b>mice.</b> Different species are found in grassland, deserts, and forests. They are all capable of saltation (jumping while in a bipedal stance), a feature that is most highly evolved in the desert-dwelling jerboas.|$|R
50|$|The seventh {{volume is}} devoted to the nine {{families}} of mouse-like rodents (Myomorpha), including the true <b>mice,</b> rats, <b>birch</b> <b>mice,</b> tree mice, jerboas, hamsters, and voles. In contrast to other systematics (e.g. Wilson/Reeder: Mammal Species of the World, 2005) the family Dipodidae was split into Dipodidae, Zapodidae and Sminthidae, a new name proposed for the former subfamily Sicistinae. The 62 colour plates are created by Toni Llobet. It covers the details to the taxonomy, range, habitat, reproduction, behaviour, and conservation status of 1,749 species from 345 genera and 9 families in one suborder. It includes a special chapter entitled Priorities for Conserving the World’s Rodents. Edited by Don E. Wilson, Thomas E. Lacher Jr, and Russell A. Mittermeier.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Birch</b> <b>mice</b> (genus Sicista) {{are small}} jumping desert rodents that {{resemble}} mice {{with a long}} tufted tail and very long hind legs, allowing for remarkable leaps. All variants possess a long tail of 65 to 110 mm of length and weigh about 6 to 14 g. Head and body length of 50 to 90 mm and hind foot length of 14 to 18 mm. The skin color is light brown or dark-brown to brownish yellow on the upper side and paler on the underside, but generally brownish.|$|R

50|$|Dipodids {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} rodents, ranging from 4 to 26 cm in body length, excluding the tail. They are all adapted for jumping, although to varying degrees. The jerboas have very long hind legs which, in most species, include cannon bones. They move either by jumping, or by walking on their hind legs. The jumping mice have long feet, but lack the extreme adaptations of the jerboas, {{so that they}} move by crawling or making short hops, rather than long leaps. Both jerboas and jumping mice have long tails to aid their balance. <b>Birch</b> <b>mice</b> have shorter tails and feet, but they, too, move by jumping.|$|R
50|$|Most dipodids are omnivorous, with a diet {{consisting}} of seeds and insects. Some species of jerboa, however, such as Allactaga sibirica, are almost entirely insectivorous. Like other rodents, they have gnawing incisors {{separated from the}} grinding cheek teeth by a gap, or diastema. The dental formula for dipodids is: Jerboas and <b>birch</b> <b>mice</b> make their nests in burrows, which, {{in the case of}} jerboas, may be complex, with side-chambers for storage of food. In contrast, while jumping mice sometimes co-opt the burrows of other species, they do not dig their own, and generally nest in thick vegetation. Most species hibernate for at least half the year, surviving on fat that they build up in the weeks prior to going to sleep.|$|R
50|$|Muroids {{are most}} {{closely related to}} the Dipodidae, a smaller group of rodents that {{includes}} the jerboas, <b>birch</b> <b>mice,</b> and jumping mice. Jerboas have a dental formula of , including incisors in the upper and lower jaws, three molars in the upper and lower jaw, and in most species a small premolar (the fourth upper premolar, P4) in the upper jaw only. In contrast, all muroids lack the P4, but some species of Pappocricetodon from the Eocene of Asia, one of the earliest known muroids, do have a P4. Some have suggested that the first molar in muroids is in fact a retained deciduous premolar, but this hypothesis has been discredited. Several species have lost the M3 and/or m3, and four species of the New Guinea murine genus Pseudohydromys have also lost the M2 and m2, so that they only have four minute molars.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>birch</b> <b>mouse</b> (Sicista subtilis) is {{a species}} of <b>birch</b> <b>mouse</b> in the family Dipodidae. It is found on the Balkan Peninsula, Ukraine, Romania, southern Russia and one isolated location in Hungary in the Borsodi Mezőség Protected Landscape Area. The Hungarian subspecies (S. subtilis trizona) is critically endangered and strictly protected. The first living specimen was captured after a 70-year-long hiatus in 2006.|$|E
50|$|The {{ecology of}} the long-tailed <b>birch</b> <b>mouse</b> is little known. It hibernates {{for at least six}} months during the winter. It builds its nest, made of a woven ball of grass, in crevices or in bushes. Litters usually consist of four to six young. This <b>birch</b> <b>mouse</b> eats green plants, berries but mostly feeds on seeds, being chiefly active at night and {{spending}} the daytime in a shallow burrow.|$|E

40|$|<b>Birch</b> <b>mice</b> (genus Sicista) {{represent}} an early diverging lineage of dipodid rodents {{with a wide}} geographic distribution and a cryptic lifestyle that makes the genus difficult to study. As a result, reconstructing the evolutionary phylogeny of the group remains incomplete. Here, we report the molecular phylogeny of the genus based on mitochondrial and nuclear markers sampled from 12 of the 14 known living species. Moreover, we discuss morphological character (i. e., fur coloration and glans penis morphology) evolution in the genus. We have found a strong agreement between phylogenetic relationships among species and morphological peculiarities, both supporting a mountainous origin of Sicista, and a recent spread towards lowlands of some lineages. Glans penis structure {{turned out to be}} rather simple in the early lineages, but became more complex in phylogenetically later diverging taxa. The presence of dorsal stripes is associated with the colonization of lowland habitats. In addition, we describe here a species new to science from the Tien Shan Mountains, and provide evidence of uncovered cryptic diversity from the region. Additionally, we revise the identification of a specimen collected from China, thus documenting the presence of Sicista pseudonapaea, previously unreported from that country...|$|R
40|$|The {{superfamily}} Dipodoidea (Rodentia, Myomorpha) in {{its current}} interpretation contains a single family subdivided into six subfamilies. Four of them include morphologically specialized bipedal arid-dwelling jerboas (Dipodinae – three-toed jerboas, Allactaginae – fivetoed jerboas, Cardiocraniinae – pygmy jerboas and Euchoreutinae – long-eared jerboas), {{the other two are}} represented by more generalized quadrupedal taxa (Zapodinae – jumping mice and Sminthinae – <b>birch</b> <b>mice).</b> Despite considerable effort from morphologists, the taxonomy as well as the phylogeny of the Dipodoidea remains controversial. Strikingly, molecular approach has never been envisaged to investigate these questions. In this study, the phylogenetic relationships among the main dipodoid lineages were reconstructed for the first time using DNA sequence data from four nuclear genes (IRBP, GHR, BRCA 1, RAG 1). No evidence of conflict among genes was revealed. The same robustly supported tree topology was inferred from the concatenated alignment whatever the phylogenetic methods used (maximum parsimony, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic methods). Sminthinae branches basally within the dipodoids followed by Zapodinae. Monophyletic Cardiocraniinae is sister to all other jerboas. Within the latter, the monophyly of both Dipodinae and Allactaginae is highly supported. The relationships between Dipodinae, Allactaginae and Euchoreutinae should be regarded as unresolved trichotomy. Morphological hypotheses were confronted to findings based on the presented molecular data. As a result, previously proposed sister group relationships between Euchoreutes and Sicista, Paradipus and Cardiocraniinae as well as the monophyly of Cardiocaniinae + Dipodinae were rejected. However, the latter association is consistently supported by most morphological analyses. The basis of the obvious conflict between genes and morphology remains unclear. Suggested modifications to the taxonomy of Dipodoidea imply recognition of three families: Sminthidae, Zapodidae and Dipodidae, the latter including Cardiocraniinae, Euchoreutinae, Allactaginae and Dipodinae as subfamilies.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore the immunomodulatory effects of betulinic acid (BA) extracted from the bark of white <b>birch</b> on <b>mice.</b> Female mice were orally administered BA for 14 days in doses of 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, and 1 mg/kg body weight. We found that BA significantly enhanced the thymus and spleen indices, and stimulated lymphocyte proliferation induced by Concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharide as shown by MTT assay. Flow cytometry revealed that BA increased the percentage of CD 4 + cells in thymus as well as the percentage of CD 19 + and the ratios of CD 4 +/CD 8 + in spleen. BA increased the number of plaque-forming cell and macrophage phagocytic activity as indicated by a neutral red dye uptake assay, and the peritoneal macrophages levels of TNF-α were also increased. In contrast, serum levels of IgG and IgM and serum concentrations of IL- 2 and IL- 6 were significantly decreased in BA-treated mice compared to the control as assayed by haemagglutination tests and ELISA, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that BA enhances mouse cellular immunity, humoral immunity, and activity of macrophages. Thus, BA is a potential immune stimulator and may strengthen the immune response of its host...|$|R

40|$|Infectious Diseases of Wild Rodents is a {{collection}} of reference material {{on a wide variety of}} infectious diseases documented in rodent species throughout the world. Editorially, this was a massive undertaking to provide a comprehensive and systematic coverage of the information on so many rodent species and infectious diseases in one volume. Although the information is not presented in much detail, the breadth of coverage makes this a good reference book for those interested in rodent diseases throughout the world. The information is presented in two different formats: disease information in the first part of the book is arranged by rodent species, and in the second part, by infectious diseases. The first five sections contain lists of specific rodent genera and species from five continents and the infectious diseases found in them. This is followed by 18 sections on individual families of viral infections in wild rodents, 18 sections on specific infectious bacterial disease agents or groups of bacterial diseases, and six sections on fungal infections. Unfortunately, infectious parasitic diseases are not included. The book is well-indexed by rodent species and by specific diseases. Each section includes a number of references depending upon the availability of information; diseases of North American rodents have the most references (344), and Coronaviruses of rodents have the fewest references (7). The sources of the references vary from original publications to reference articles, chapters, or books. The index is organized by rodent genera and common names, and by disease or pathogen name, or genus and species of pathogen. In the first part of the book, the rodent material is arranged by continent and within these sections, by family and genus of rodent. The amount of information for each genus or species of rodent varies depending upon how common the rodents are. Padovan includes the distribution of the rodents, some limited taxonomy, and a little information on behavior and habitat associations. The rodent information is followed by evidence of isolation of disease agents from, or specific antibody in, each rodent species and limited information on the disease. For some of the rodent species, the information is very brief. For example, ‘‘a hantavirus (Family Bunyaviridae) has been found in northern <b>birch</b> <b>mice</b> (Sicista betulina) in Russia’’; the citation for this is a book chapter. For more common rodents, such as species in the Peromyscus genus, there are multiple tables listing the disease agents found in each species and several pages of summary information about the diseases found in these rodent species. The descriptions appear to be accurate and the taxonomy of the rodents and pathogens correct. There are some redundancies in the descriptions of the rodent species that are unnecessary, for example, the statement, ‘‘Yersinia pestis, the cause of plague,’’ is repeated for multiple rodent descriptions instead of using the common name of plague following its original appearance...|$|R
50|$|A {{theme of}} Wiedermann's allergy {{research}} has been the treatment of allergies via mucosal tolerance induction with recombinant allergens, probiotics or other microbes. For a key 2001 paper in the International Archives of Allergy and Immunology Wiedermann used recombinant fragments of the birch pollen allergen Bet v I to induce mucosal tolerance in a <b>mouse</b> model of <b>birch</b> pollen allergy. In 2008 the Wiedermann lab challenged the 'microflora hypothesis', which holds that altered microflora contributed to allergies, by showing that Bet v 1 could induce mucosal tolerance in mice regardless of {{the presence or absence}} of microflora. In 2009 the Wiedermann lab provided some supporting evidence for the hygiene hypothesis of allergies by showing that infection with the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii could prevent allergic immune responses in <b>birch</b> pollen allergic <b>mice.</b> In 2011 the Wiedermann lab showed in mice that probiotics could have anti-allergic effects against multiple allergens. In 2012 the Wiedermann lab showed that a fusion protein containing several allergens could treat birch pollen-related food allergy, in which patients are allergic to homologues of Bet v I. Also in 2012 the Wiedermann lab showed in mice that perinatal administration of Lactobacillus paracasei to pregnant and lactating mothers could protect against the development of airway inflammation in offspring.|$|R
