40|$|ABSTRACT. The rate {{of losses}} {{resulting}} from fish (rainbow trout {{of a total}} length of 12 – 23 cm, {{the same size as}} sea trout smolts) passing through turbines was estimated. The fish were provided with 3 x 4 cm Styrofoam floats tied to their backs under the dorsal fin. The tagged fish were immersed in covered buckets into the inlet of the turbine canal before switching on the turbines. The <b>bucket</b> <b>lids</b> were removed by a special line, and the fish were drawn into the turbine canal with the water flow. After passing through the canal, the fish, which had a limited area to move in at a greater depth and were easily identified due to the styrofoam floats, were recaptured manually with nets from boats. Fish losses at the hydroelectric power plants situated on Pomeranian rivers ranged from 0. 0 to 60 % and depended on the differences between water levels upstream and downstream from the hydroelectric power plants and on the turbine’s rotation speed per minute...|$|R

30|$|We {{surveyed}} all plots {{using an}} array of seven pitfall traps, three funnel traps, and 18 Sherman live-traps. For the pitfall trap array, we buried seven 19 L buckets flush with the ground and connected them using shade cloth drift fence. These arrays formed a “Y” shape, with each arm being approximately 15 m long and the buckets buried 7.5 m apart as described by Fisher et al. (2008). We placed one funnel trap along each arm between the two outer buckets (Fisher et al. 2008). We then placed nine pairs of Sherman live-traps approximately 1 m and 16 m from the center bucket between each arm of the drift fence and approximately 9 m from the center bucket along each arm of the drift fence. Each pair was composed of one Sherman XLK trap (8 cm × 9 cm × 30.5 cm) and one larger Sherman XLF 15 trap (10 cm × 11.5 cm × 38 cm). We left pitfall and funnel traps unbaited as passive traps for mammals, and baited Sherman traps with steam-rolled oats. We placed raised <b>bucket</b> <b>lids</b> over the pitfall traps and wood roof tiles over the funnel and Sherman traps to provide daytime shading and cover for captured animals. We placed a baseball sized piece of polyester batting {{in all of the}} trap types to insulate captured animals from colder nighttime temperatures. For each session, we sampled traps each morning for four consecutive days. Including all trap types, our sampling effort totaled 168 trap-nights per array before the fire and 336 trap-nights per array after the fire.|$|R

50|$|Milk was {{originally}} distributed in 'pails', a <b>lidded</b> <b>bucket</b> with a handle. Often two pails would {{be carried on}} either end of a wooden yoke. Once the railways started carrying milk, the pail proved less than ideal as it was top-heavy and tended to spill. Dairy farmers used a tall conical wooden container - a butter churn - to 'churn' the milk into butter, and this proved to be preferable for the railways to transport. It held a lot more milk (about seventeen gallons) and its conical shape made it less likely to spill or topple over. These wooden churns were intrinsically heavy, and starting in the 1850s a steel version was introduced and soon became the standard. The usage of the word 'churn' was retained for describing these containers, although they were not themselves used for 'churning' butter.|$|R
25|$|LLDPE {{is defined}} by a density range of 0.915–0.925nbsp&g/cm3. LLDPE is a {{substantially}} linear polymer with significant numbers of short branches, commonly made by copolymerization of ethylene with short-chain alpha-olefins (for example, 1-butene, 1-hexene, and 1-octene). LLDPE has higher tensile strength than LDPE, and it exhibits higher impact and puncture resistance than LDPE. Lower thickness (gauge) films can be blown, compared with LDPE, with better environmental stress-cracking resistance, but is not as easy to process. LLDPE is used in packaging, particularly film for bags and sheets. Lower thickness may be used compared to LDPE. It is used for cable coverings, toys, <b>lids,</b> <b>buckets,</b> containers, and pipe. While other applications are available, LLDPE is used predominantly in film applications due to its toughness, flexibility, and relative transparency. Product examples range from agricultural films, Saran wrap, and bubble wrap, to multilayer and composite films. In 2013, the world LLDPE market reached a volume of US$40 billion.|$|R

40|$|Magister Public Health - MPHIntroduction: In-house {{contamination}} {{of drinking water}} stored in wide-mouthed <b>buckets</b> (even with <b>lids)</b> has been widely reported in epidemiologic investigations as vehicles for diarrhoea disease transmission. The long handled mukombe cup (LHM cup), recently developed by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), a department of the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC) in Zimbabwe, is a promising low cost dipping devise for extraction of water from wide-mouthed containers. Aim: The study aim {{was to assess the}} effectiveness and household acceptability of the long handled mukombe cup in reducing bacteriological {{contamination of}} drinking water stored in wide-mouthed vessels in the home in a peri urban settlement in Harare, Zimbabwe. Methodology: A randomised controlled trial of a long handled mukombe cup was conducted in Hatcliffe, Harare. After collecting baseline data on demographics, household water quality, and other sanitation and water handling practices, households were given basic health education before the two selected communities were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the two groups of 119 households each. The intervention group received the LHM cup while the control group received no intervention. Households were followed up after two months and assessed effectiveness and user acceptability of the intervention. Data Analysis: Data analysis was conducted using STATA 11. Descriptive statistics were calculated and reported as percentages, proportions, frequencies and measures of central tendency. Bivariate statistics were carried out to test independent associations between use of the LHM cup and E. coli. All analyses were conducted in an intention-to-intervene analysis. Results: A total of 230 households were analysed during follow-up. Samples of stored drinking water from intervention households were significantly lower in E. coli levels than those of control households (geometric mean E. coli of 0. 8 / 100 ml vs 13. 0 / 100 ml, p 5 (p = 0. 071). Acceptability of the LHM cup was very high (100 %). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study on the evaluation and acceptability of the LHM cup in the Sub-Saharan Africa. Positive results were recorded that showed that the LHM cup was effective in minimising E. coli contamination in the intervention group as compared to the control group. It is postulated that this is because the LHM cup reduces hand contact with stored water during scooping, thus maintaining improved water quality in communities in Zimbabwe that collect and store drinking water in wide-mouthed containers with lids where extraction is by scooping. However, more research is required to document the LHM cup's continued and effective use, durability and overall sustainability in the absence of any serious sampling or monitoring...|$|R
5000|$|Billie Davies {{was born}} in Brugge, Belgium. Mostly growing up on the Belgian Coast, in Western Europe, at the North Sea, between Bruges, Knokke, Blankenberge and Zeebrugge, her grandfather, Maurice Clybouw (1912 Eernegem - 1984 Brugge), who immigrated with his parents to Paris, France when he was 8, in 1920, and moved back to Belgium, Bruges in 1943, {{was the first to}} {{introduce}} her to the drums when Billie was about three years old. She has had a love relationship with rhythm and drums ever since. Her mother, Simone Clybouw (born in Rueil-Malmaison 1934), was her biggest influence on a personal and artistic level, and introduced her to Jazz and Classical music before Billie had made her first footstep. It was her mother who sent Billie to music school when she was 7, which did not work out very well as Billie started skipping classes, and who introduced her to live jazz and other music performances from when she was a toddler until she was a young teenager, and introduced her to the world of art, entertainers, painters, poets and professors, musicians and chefs. While Billie grew up with music from Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Mahalia Jackson, Nina Simone, Edith Piaf, Frank Sinatra, Django Reinhardt, Ella Fitzgerald, Toots Thielemans, Joe Pass, Oscar Peterson, Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Mozart, Ravel, Paganini, Vivaldi and Chopin, in her ears, at age 11 Billie began singing with school choirs and church choirs. At age 12, Billie’s first serious stage performance was with a Youth Opera in Sint-Kruis (Bruges), a rendition of Romeo and Juliet fashioned Billie as Romeo due to her exceptional vocal range and sense of music and theatre. As she continued to develop her love of the arts some of the highlights were, at age 14, her first performance as a drummer playing John Lennon’s “Power to the People” on plastic <b>buckets,</b> and aluminum <b>lids</b> in front of a crowd of about 100 kids at the beach in De Panne where she also sang a duet [...] "Who'll Stop the Rain" [...] by John Fogerty. At age 17, at the Royal Concert Building of Bruges, Koninklijke Stadsschouwburg Brugge, she directed and choreographed a group of 5 performers and co-performed in Sunshiny Days, which was inspired by writer Johnny Nash’s song [...] "I Can See Clearly Now" [...] and the music of Gladys Knight and the Pips. The audience demanded an encore. With DJing becoming such a huge part of our culture by the time she reached 18, Billie had started presenting professionally in the entertainment industry in Bruges where she specifically remembers the [...] "Saaihalle", which now seems to be The Frietmuseum, where she enjoyed her first DJ adventures, [...] "Le Carrousel", that since has transformed into a hotel, where she worked as a bartender/DJ from around 5pm to 2am and mostly entertained the Opera crowd, singers, directors, artists and Opera employees, and her absolute favorite, the hottest small jazz club in town in 1976-77, [...] "Het Patriciershof" [...] on the Jan Van Eyck Square, Jan van Eyckplein, where she worked from around 2-2:30 am to 8 am and where René, one of the owners and an old jazz friend of her mother, introduced her to the jazz of Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker, Miles Davies, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, Lester Bowie, Cecil Taylor, Archie Shepp and even more at the time considered obscure jazz musicians, and where she became a bartender and Dj, and entertained the Jazz crowd of Bruges deep nightlife that usually consisted of entertainers, musicians, painters, writers, chefs, hair stylists, fashion designers, models, gamblers and lots of whisky drinkers which were served [...] "under the table" [...] due to the existing prohibition of no alcohol to be served in public. All these experiences further enriched her love of rhythms and beats, of music, of jazz, cementing her desire to pursue drumming and fulfilling her need to entertain.As an early adult at 21, Billie became a solo singer for 1 year with the Royal Army Choir of Belgium. The high point of that adventure was singing at the Antwerp Opera with a complete symphonic orchestra. A year later, her voice underwent a dramatic change and she never felt comfortable singing again.|$|R
40|$|Essential {{beekeeping}} tools Cue: Ask {{anyone who}} earns {{a living from}} a practical job ? a mechanic, carpenter, plumber or builder ? about the secrets of success, {{and you can be}} fairly certain that having the right tools {{will be one of the}} most important. Without the right tool, a job can take twice as long, and you may end up completely breaking what you are trying to mend. Some people describe beekeeping as almost like an art; it demands specialist knowledge to do it well. It also needs some specialised equipment. This does not have to be expensive, and much of it beekeepers can make themselves, but without it the beekeeper will struggle, and may become both discouraged by failure and stung by bees. Warwick Selzer is an experienced beekeeper from Midrand, a town just north of Johannesburg in South Africa. Lucas Moloi spoke to him about the most important items of beekeeping equipment. Number one, according to Warwick, is the smoker, a tool which beekeepers use to push smoke around and into a hive before they begin their work. Lucas asked him why a smoker is so important. IN:		?A smoker, what it does for a beekeeper ? OUT:		?long as you are not highly allergic. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 23 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Warwick Selzer, a beekeeper from Midrand in South Africa. In addition to the advice he gave to Lucas, people who are allergic to bee stings must be extremely careful not to get stung. If possible, they should keep anti-sting drugs with them whenever they go to a place where bees may be found. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Selzer	A smoker, what it does for a beekeeper is it just makes your work with the hive or with the colony that you are working with easier, it calms them done. Because the natural reaction to smoke is that there is a veld fire or a wild fire, and with that they may need to leave their hive. So in that instance they eat as much honey as they can so that if in the event that they need to leave the hive, they can do so and at least have some kind of resources. And with that, what happens is that the bees, because they are so full of honey they struggle to sting. It makes them also a little bit lethargic, they are less likely to fly, less likely to sting you. But what you do not also want to do Lucas is over-smoke. If you over-smoke bees it takes them about a week to ten days to regain their stable environment inside the hive. You lose potentially a week to ten days of efficient harvesting if you over-smoke. Moloi		So can beekeepers make their own smokers? Selzer	Yes they can. It is very possible; all you need is a cylinder, a bellow, you drill a hole within the cylinder, you need a lid for the cylinder to be closed on which will have a funnel leading off of it. The bellow then must be attached to that cylinder. All you need to do then is basically open the lid, put the fuel into the cylinder, light it, let it burn for a while and then once you have got enough of a fire going or enough of the fuel is lit, you close it and then wait about another minute or two and you should be able to puff the bellow and smoke will be produced. Moloi		So what fuel is best to burn in the smoker? Selzer	Pine needles are very good, they are extremely effective, they give off a good smoke, they burn easily as well. Secondly would be horse manure, strangely enough. You can also use oak chips. I also use non marked or non printed cardboard material. Moloi		So are there other tools that could be useful? Selzer	You need to also have what we call a hive tool, it is very similar to a chisel. It has got like a wrench on the one side and then a flat chisel end on the other side. Now this Lucas is used to actually pry open the lid from the hive. To pry that open you need to have quite a strong piece of stainless steel metal which we call this hive tool. You put it in there and give it a hard jerk and then basically it pries it open pretty neatly. Other than that I would say a bucket is probably useful as well for when you are harvesting honey. You take off the honeycomb and empty it into a <b>bucket</b> with a <b>lid,</b> keep the lid on at all times so that bees do not get into the bucket as well. Other than that probably just a light if you are working at night, or a torch and that would be about it. Moloi		What is the best thing to do if bees start to attack you? Selzer	In a case like that the best thing to do is to get indoors, make sure the doors and windows are closed. If you cannot do that, do not jump into a pool or a body of water. That does not work. Bees are clever, they are intelligent insects and what they will do is that they will wait for you because you cannot hold your breath for ever, right? So what happens is as soon as you come up from the water for air they will sting you every time and they are quick. So do not jump into a body of water or a pool. Do not try and spray the bees with water, that does not work either. Get indoors, get into a car, close the windows, close the doors. The other alternative basically Lucas is to run. Bees will follow you probably for a kilometre but no more than, I would say, two kilometres at an extreme. So those are your two options. Moloi		So what is the best treatment for bee stings? Selzer	Once you have been stung vinegar, applying vinegar, even honey itself; if you can get raw honey apply that. A hot shower actually can also assist, especially with the itching. But the way that you remove that sting is also vital. If you try and pinch that sting to take it out, or scratch it, you could in fact inject yourself with more of the poison in the process. So what I would suggest in the case of being stung, is to use a flat item like a ruler, scissors, knife, anything that is flat, where you lie the thing flat against the skin and you scrap along the skin so that you ensure that you are basically breaking off the tip of the sting rather than trying to go for the head of the sting. It is also important to take note when you are stung what area that you have been stung or somebody has been stung in. If you are stung anywhere on the face you are going to have a much more heightened reaction, especially with the eyes and the lips, ears, breathing, that type of thing. If it is in the mouth, even worse. In that instance, doctor immediately, clinic, hospital whatever the case is. Because with the swelling, the reaction is that your mouth and your tongue and even possibly your throat swells up to such an extent that you actually cannot breathe without assistance. If you are stung on the hand or the arms it is not really that important as long as you are not highly allergic. End of track. Making and using smokers and hive tools, and what to do if attacked or stung by bees...|$|R
40|$|Authors: Edward Hutchinson & Ervin Fodor ### Abstract It {{is often}} useful to {{concentrate}} and purify the pleomorphic, enveloped virions of influenza viruses prior to analysis. This protocol describes a standard method for purifying ‘spherical’ influenza virions, {{the most common}} morphology of laboratory-adapted strains, by rate-zonal ultracentrifugation through a discontinuous density gradient. The protocol, which takes around eight hours to complete, is designed for virions shed into the growth media of infected cells, and would also be suitable for concentrating virions from the allantoic fluid of embryonated chicken eggs. Two different density gradients are described: a conventional gradient of sucrose and a gradient of iodixanol (OptiPrep™ density gradient medium). A high degree of virion purity can be achieved, but small quantities of contaminants will remain. These can be removed by an optional haemadsorption-elution (HAd) step, which takes an additional one and half hours. This allows extremely efficient removal of the original contaminants, but introduces other, distinct contaminants at low levels. ### Materials Consumables required: 1. 0. 45 μm syringe filters - 50 ml syringes - 50 ml plastic tubes - 15 ml plastic tubes – optional - Thickwall tubes for the SW 28 rotor (polyallomer centrifuge tubes, 25 × 89 mm; Beckman Coulter; 355642) - Thinwall tubes for the SW 41 rotor (polyallomer centrifuge tubes, 14 × 89 mm; Beckman Coulter; 331372) - 5 ml syringe and needle (21 G or similar) - 1. 5 ml tubes - Standard plasticware, pipettes, permanent marker pen Reagents required: 1. 10 × NTC solution (1 M NaCl, 0. 2 M Tris-HCl pH 7. 4, 50 mM CaCl 2) - sucrose or OptiPrep™ density gradient medium (Sigma; D 1556) - sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) - ddH 2 O - adult chicken blood cells in Alsever’s (TCS Biosciences; FB 010) – optional ### Equipment 1. Rotating wheel – optional - Refrigerator - 37 °C water bath - Benchtop centrifuge with refrigeration (e. g. a Rotanta 460 R, Hettich Lab Technology) - Mass balance - Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) - Beckman Coulter SW 28 swinging bucket rotor - Beckman Coulter SW 41 swinging bucket rotor - Aspiration vessel suitable for infectious material (e. g. an Integra Vacusafe; optional) - - 80 °C freezer ### Procedure 1. Prepare solutions in advance and store in the refrigerator – all should be used cold. Prepare: - a. 1 × NTC solution (from 10 × stock). - b. Working dilutions for the density gradient. If using sucrose, make 50 ml aliquots of 30, 40, 50 and 60 % solutions (w/v) by adding the required mass of sucrose to 5 ml 10 × NTC and topping up with ddH 2 O. Mix on a rotating wheel until dissolved, then pass through an 0. 45 μm syringe filter into a clean 50 ml tube. Mix equal amounts of these solutions in additional tubes to produce 35, 45 and 55 % solutions (w/v). If using OptiPrep™, follow a similar procedure to prepare a 10 – 40 % (w/v) series of iodixanol solutions in NTC (OptiPrep™ is 60 % iodixanol, so 12 ml solutions at 10, 20, 30 and 40 % should contain 1. 2 ml 10 × NTC and 2, 4, 6 and 8 ml OptiPrep™, respectively. Intermediate concentrations (15, 25 and 35 %) can be prepared by mixing, as above.) - c. To prepare a step gradient, layer 1. 5 ml {{of each of the}} seven solutions into a thinwall tube. Starting with the most concentrated solution, use a pipette to slowly add layers, 0. 75 ml at a time, taking care not to mix layers (the interfaces of different concentrations should remain visible). Gradients can be prepared in advance and stored at 4 °C (some mixing by diffusion is acceptable); if prepared during the purification this should be done during the first ultracentrifugation step. If only one gradient is required a balance can be quickly prepared by mixing 5. 25 ml of the most and least concentrated solutions, or using 10. 5 ml of the middle concentration. - d. If performing HAd, prepare chicken blood. To prevent lysis, blood should be centrifuged at no more than 1, 250 g (around 2, 500 rpm if using 15 ml tubes in a benchtop centrifuge, depending on the rotor) at 10 °C; although it should be kept cold it should not be put directly on ice. On receipt cells should be rinsed twice in chilled PBS. Comparison of the cell pellet to liquid in another tube should be used to estimate the volume of cells, and the pellet resuspended in PBS to 20 % packed cell volume (pcv) for storage in the refrigerator. If haemolysis occurs during storage the cells should be rinsed again in PBS and resuspended in an appropriate volume. When about to begin purification, pre-warm an aliquot of PBS to 37 °C. - Prepare virus to be concentrated. A maximum of 150 ml of virus-containing medium can be prepared without prior HAd. This can be obtained from six 175 cm 2 tissue culture flasks which have been seeded with a suitable cell line (e. g. Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney or Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells), infected when sub-confluent with an influenza virus at a low multiplicity of infection, and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator for approximately 48 h. - When the virus is ready to harvest, extensive cytopathic effect will be apparent by microscopy. Transfer the media to six 50 ml tubes and centrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min at approximately 2000 g (around 4, 000 rpm, depending on the rotor) to pellet cellular debris. - Transfer the supernatant to six (thickwall) tubes and place in the buckets of an SW 28 rotor. Weigh the <b>buckets</b> (with the <b>lids</b> on) and transfer media between them as necessary to balance. Centrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min at 18, 000 g (10, 000 rpm) in an SW 28 rotor to further pellet cellular debris. Retain 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - If extremely high purity is required (and chicken red blood cell contaminants are not problematic) perform HAd as described in steps (3) – (9). Otherwise, proceed to step (10). - Optional. Transfer supernatants to six clean, chilled 50 ml tubes and add 325 μl of chicken red blood cells (20 % pcv) to each tube. Mix by gentle inversion and refrigerate for 30 min, inverting regularly. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend all pellet in a single aliquot of 10 ml chilled PBS – to do so, sequentially rinse each tube with the same 5 ml aliquot of PBS, repeat with a second 5 ml aliquot, and pool both aliquots a single 15 ml tube. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend pellet in 10 ml chilled PBS (some agglutination of cells is likely to be apparent). Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend pellet in 10 ml 37 °C PBS, transfer to a clean, room-temperature 50 ml tube and increase the volume to 20 ml with 37 °C PBS. Incubate at 37 °C for 15 min, mixing regularly by gentle inversion. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C), and take 100 μl of the supernatant for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Prepare two thickwall tubes with 5 ml chilled 5 % sucrose or 10 % iodixanol. Gently layer the supernatant onto the 5 ml cushion, using gravity flow and taking care not to mix the layers (the interface should remain visible). Add 20 ml PBS or water to the second tube to balance. Place the tubes in SW 28 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volume of the balance tube as necessary. Proceed to step (11). - If HAd was not performed, prepare 6 thickwall tubes with 5 ml chilled 5 % sucrose or 10 % iodixanol in each. Gently layer the supernatants onto the 5 ml cushions, using gravity flow and taking care not to mix the layers (the interface should remain visible). Place the tubes in SW 28 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 28 rotor at 4 °C for 90 min at 112, 000 g (25, 000 rpm). Aspirate the supernatants, taking care not to disturb the pellet (which may not be visible). When nearing the bottom of the tube, run the aspiration pipette around the meniscus and tilt away from the pellet to remove the supernatant. Add 50 μl chilled 1 × NTC to each tube (or around 500 μl to the single tube if HAd was used) and resuspend by pipetting up and down. Pool the suspension and layer gently onto the top of a density gradient (see 1. c, above) taking care not to mix the layers. Place the gradient tube and a balance tube into SW 41 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 41 rotor at 4 °C for 150 min at 209, 000 g (35, 000 rpm). Afterwards, the virions should be visible as a ‘milky’ band of material at around 40 % sucrose or 30 % iodixanol. Hold the tube against a dark background and use a pen to mark the position of the meniscus and of the virions. Secure the tube and, using a 5 ml syringe and needle, carefully pierce the side of the tube a few millimetres below the virions. While moving the needle tip gently forwards and backwards, withdraw around 1 cm height of the gradient (1 – 2 ml), including the band of virions. Eject the contents of the syringe into a new thinwall tube containing 9 ml chilled 1 × NTC, and rinse out the syringe once in this solution. Place the tube and a balance tube in SW 41 rotor buckets weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 41 rotor at 4 °C for 60 min at 154, 000 g (30, 000 rpm). Aspirate the supernatant, taking care not to disturb the pellet. Add around 80 μl chilled 1 ×NTC and resuspend by pipetting; this should give around 150 μl of a milky solution of purified virions. Reserve around 10 % for analysis, and store the rest in a 1. 5 ml tube at - 80 °C. ### Timing - 1. Solution preparation. When convenient. - 2. Generation of virus. Two days. - 3. Harvesting and clarification. 40 min. - 4. Transfer, balance and clarification. 50 min. - 5 – 9. HAd (optional). 90 min. - 10. Layering onto cushions. 15 min. - 11. Ultracentrifugation. 120 min. - 12. Ultracentrifugation. 180 min. - 13. Ultracentrifugation. 80 min. Approximate time for purifications (steps 3 – 13) : 8 hours without HAd, 9 and a half hours with HAd. ### Troubleshooting - Growth of virus can be assessed before beginning by microscopic examination of cells (step 3). If no cytopathic effect is visible it is unlikely that there will be enough virus to purify. - With the volumes described, concentrated virus should be visible in steps 12 and 13 (though a dark background may be necessary in step 12, and the band may be faint). Additional bands may appear in step 12 depending on the mixing of the gradient steps and on the morphology of the virus; for most applications the major band can be harvested, but if this is ambiguous the entire gradient can be harvested in aliquots from the top (step 13 is then not required). - Samples taken throughout the purification can help to identify problems. A number of assays can be used to detect virions, including plaque assay (to detect fully infectious virions – typically recovery of infectious material is around 10 – 30 %) and SDS-PAGE followed by silver-staining (to assess purity). If chicken blood is being used a quick assay for the presence of virions (whether infectious or not) can be performed while other steps are being carried out using a modified haemagglutination (HA) assay. In a 96 -well round-bottomed dish add 50 μl PBS to 11 of the 12 columns, leaving the first column empty (a multi-channel pipette is helpful throughout this assay). In the first column add 100 μl of sample or PBS (up to eight samples per dish; material from the final step in the purification should only be used if heavily diluted beforehand), and perform twofold serial dilutions of this by transferring 50 μl into the second column, mixing, changing pipette tip and repeating across the dish. Then add 50 μl chicken red blood cells (at 1 % pcv) to each well, mix and leave to stand, preferably at 4 °C. For each sample the last dilution in which the blood cells agglutinate and cannot settle {{to the bottom of the}} well contains one haemagglutinating unit (HAU). Note that, as this is a modification of the standard assay, the HAU values here are useful only for relative measures and should not be compared to other experiments. Note also that the assay is rather insensitive to low concentrations of virus. Typical end-points are 1 / 128 for the input material (in 120 ml) and 1 / 512 after HAd (in 20 ml – i. e. around 2 / 3 recovery of material). ### Anticipated Results The method described should result in a thousand-fold decrease in volume with, typically, a 10 – 30 % recovery of infectious material (plaque-forming units). As some virus will be inactivated during purification the physical recovery of material is likely to be better than this. Electron microscopy shows that virions generally remain intact during purification (see Fig 1 b of ref (1) and Fig 1 b of ref (2)). Purification without HAd is sufficient to remove the majority of contaminating material, as can be seen by SDS-PAGE and silver staining in Fig 1 a of ref (1) and Fig 1 a of ref (2), and this is likely to be sufficient for the majority of applications. However, as shown in Fig 3 b of ref (2) low levels of contaminants are still present when material is purified in this way. These contaminants can be excluded by HAd, as shown in Fig 3 c of ref (2), though this method introduces additional contaminants derived from chicken red blood cells. Readers interested in the presence of specific protein contaminants after purification with and without HAd are referred to the supplementary data of ref (2). ### References 1. Hutchinson, E.
