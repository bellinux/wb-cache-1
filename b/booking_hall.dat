5|$|Over 1,000 GER {{employees}} who {{died during the}} war were honoured on a large marble memorial installed in the <b>booking</b> <b>hall,</b> unveiled on 22 June 1922 by Sir Henry Wilson. On his return home from the unveiling ceremony, Wilson was assassinated by two Irish Republican Army members. He was commemorated by a memorial plaque adjoining the GER monument, unveiled one month after his death. The GER memorial was relocated during the modification of the station and now incorporates both the Wilson and Fryatt memorials, {{as well as a}} number of railway related architectural elements salvaged from demolished buildings.|$|E
5|$|The sixth {{line into}} Preston {{was that of}} the Preston and Blackburn Railway, which opened on 1 June 1846, joining the North Union line {{immediately}} south of Farrington Station (respelt “Farington” from October 1857). The railway company was absorbed into the East Lancashire Railway (ELR) on 3 August 1846. Once again, the NUR charged high tolls for the use of its line which led the ELR to build its own line into Preston. The line was initially opposed by Preston Corporation, but was eventually permitted on condition that the embankment north of the Ribble (which later became the dividing line between Avenham and Miller Parks) be ornamentally laid out, and that a pedestrian path (still in use today) be provided on the river bridge. The line ran into new platforms built {{on the east side of}} the North Union station, which were managed and staffed by the ELR, and which had their own <b>booking</b> <b>hall</b> and entrance in Butler Street. The new platforms were effectively a separate station. The new line and station opened on 2 September 1850.|$|E
5|$|Following the takeover, a new {{stationmaster}}'s {{house was}} built at Sea Mills, {{at a cost of}} £240. The stationmaster is recorded as having kept a variety of farm animals and sold eggs to passengers. Increased levels of traffic saw the line through Sea Mills doubled in the early 1900s, and the opportunity was taken to rebuild the station. A second platform opened on 6 January 1907 {{to the west of the}} tracks to serve northbound trains. The original platform now exclusively served southbound trains, and was lengthened to , the same length as the new platform. A station building was constructed on the original platform in a domestic style, with an arched terracotta entrance, spar-covered walls and a high-pitched tiled roof. The building contained a <b>booking</b> <b>hall,</b> booking office, toilets and a ladies' waiting room. A smaller building on the northbound platform contained a general waiting room. The subway under the bridge over the River Trym was also built at this time, with the porter's job being expanded to include washing the rubbish out of the subway after high tide, for which the railway provided a hosepipe and Wellington boots. By 1910 there were 17 trains from Bristol to Avonmouth and 15 back, increasing to 21 and 19 respectively by 1920, though not all stopped at Sea Mills. The station was completely closed on Sundays.|$|E

The current station {{was built to}} replace it and was opened by Sir Peter Parker (chairman of BR) on 9 October 1978. The station was moved about 110 yd north; the slow lines were realigned to the west next to the 1890 fast lines, to which platforms were added.|$|R

5|$|In 1934 the Cunard Steamship Company {{merged with}} the White Star Line to form Cunard White Star Line, which became the largest {{passenger}} steamship company in the world, helping to make Liverpool {{one of the most}} important centres of the British trans-Atlantic ocean liner industry. The Cunard building subsequently acted as the central headquarters for the newly merged firm, with both administrative and ship-designing facilities located within the building. Many ships and liners were developed and designed at the Cunard Building, including the RMS Queen Mary and RMS Queen Elizabeth. Given that Liverpool was a major trans-Atlantic port and due to the building's proximity to the River Mersey, the lower floors of the Cunard Building were allocated to provide space for cruise liner passengers, both prior to and after sailing. Within the building there were passenger facilities including separate waiting rooms for first, second and third class passengers, a <b>booking</b> <b>hall,</b> luggage storage space, and a currency exchange. The building also provided facilities for both land and sea based Cunard employees. During the Second World War, the sub-basement level of the Cunard Building was used as an air raid shelter for workers in the building and also for those from adjacent premises. The basement levels also served as the central Air Raid Precautions headquarters for the City of Liverpool during the war. Additional reinforced steel joists were fitted to further strengthen the basement in case of a direct hit on the building.|$|E

50|$|This was Buckle's {{big break}} {{and during the}} pre-war years {{and after the war}} until 1963 Buckle {{produced}} some estimated 85 posters and 25 carriage prints for the railways making him one of the most prolific and recognised railway poster artists. He was a close friend of Terence Cuneo whom he met frequently on travels around England recording scenes for the railway posters that were a common site on railway station platforms and <b>booking</b> <b>halls.</b> Both Artists have surviving artwork in the National Railway Museum NRM. However when the work started to dry up in 1963, following the Beeching Axe, Buckle relied more and more on the private market place to earn a living. On the advice of Terence Cuneo, he moved away almost entirely from oil painting to concentrate his efforts on watercolours.|$|R
5|$|In 1973 the British Railways Board, London Transport Executive, Greater London Council and the Department of the Environment {{produced}} a report examining the modernisation of London transport. It recommended high priority given to reconstructing Liverpool Street and Broad Street stations and recommended financing this through property {{development on the}} site. Liverpool Street {{had a number of}} design and access issues, many of which derived from the 1890 extension which had effectively created two stations on one site, with two concourses linked by walkways, multiple <b>booking</b> <b>halls,</b> and inefficient traffic flows within the station. Additionally the rail infrastructure presented limitations; only seven of the platforms could accommodate 12-carriage trains, and the track exit layout was a bottleneck. In 1975 British Railways announced plans to demolish and redevelop both stations. The proposed demolition met considerable public opposition and prompted a campaign led by the Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman, leading to a public inquiry from November 1976 to February 1977.|$|R
25|$|The station <b>booking</b> <b>hall</b> was sympathetically {{refurbished}} {{over the}} five months to March 2008 {{to resemble the}} original Great Western Railway art-deco style, including the installation of ticket barriers.

25|$|Network Rail {{announced}} in early 2013 that Lime Street {{was to be}} the third station to be refurbished as part of the £40million investment which would see all Merseyrail underground stations excluding Conway Park refurbished. This included the refurbishment of the platform and the <b>booking</b> <b>hall.</b> The station refurbishment work took place between April and August 2013.|$|E
25|$|As of late 2013 {{the main}} station {{entrance}} and <b>booking</b> <b>hall</b> were closed due to extensive repairs {{being required to}} the ticket office floor and {{the replacement of the}} station's glazed roof.

25|$|As {{part of the}} public–private {{partnership}} {{arrangement for}} maintenance of the London Underground, the station was due to be refurbished by Metronet. Following the collapse of Metronet, responsibility of station upkeep was transferred to Transport for London in 2008. Works were planned to include provision of tactile strips and colour contrasted handrails for the visually impaired, installation of closed-circuit television cameras, passenger help points, new electronic departure information displays on the platforms, a new public address system, and improved lighting. Transport for London has assigned the station to the 'limited works' category and plans to complete these improvements incrementally, according {{to the need to}} preserve assets. The station does not have step free access from the platforms to the street, although there are two out of use lift shafts from the platforms to the <b>booking</b> <b>hall.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Born on 16 April 1843 in London, he was {{the tenth}} of {{thirteen}} children of Swithin Horne of Regent’s Park. In 1860, he was articled for five years to the architect George Rowden Burnell. Following some early independent work, he was engaged by the NLR to replace six of the earlier wooden stations with distinctive buildings to project the Company's image and accommodate {{the increasing number of}} passengers using the line. Located at Highbury and Islington, Bow, Barnsbury, Canonbury, Camden Town and Hackney, these new stations with their vast <b>booking</b> <b>halls,</b> mansard roofs & arcades of shops were described in" [...] London’s Historic Stations."
