25|$|The cars, as built, {{featured}} an old {{style of}} WABCO passenger braking equipment previously used on passenger railroads. The braking schedule {{was known as}} AM(P). Originally, it was known as AM, but the 'P' was added later to distinguish the setup from newer AM types like AML. Therefore {{for the purposes of}} this notation, the P has been included in parentheses – as in Braking Schedule AM(P) – to acknowledge this change. On a train equipped with AM(P), there was no electric synchronization of braking throughout a train, so a <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> took a few seconds to apply or release uniformly throughout a train as different cars reacted to the brake request (which was entirely pneumatic) at different times. Additionally, an operator could not partially reduce his <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> so as to smooth out stops or correct if he had undershot the mark (a feature known as a graduated release of the brakes). The AM(P) setup required the train to fully release the brakes before they could be applied again. This made making precision stops in stations by motormen a real art, but a task that the majority of IRT motormen proved up to.|$|E
25|$|Disc brakes {{were most}} popular on sports cars {{when they were}} first introduced, since these {{vehicles}} are more demanding about brake performance. Discs have now become the more common form in most passenger vehicles, although many (particularly light weight vehicles) use drum brakes on the rear wheels to keep costs and weight down as well as to simplify the provisions for a parking brake. As the front brakes perform most of the <b>braking</b> <b>effort,</b> this can be a reasonable compromise.|$|E
25|$|By 1910, an {{improved}} braking schedule had been introduced, known as AMRE. This setup, and all others to come after, permitted graduated {{release of the}} brakes for finer control of brake applications. Additionally, AMRE allowed for the electric synchronization of braking throughout an entire train, causing all brakes on all cars of the train to apply uniformly and simultaneously. This created a smoother <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> throughout the train. In order for the electric synchronization to work, {{it was necessary to}} insert an electric brake key to activate the feature. All of the older IRT cars, including the Composites, were refitted with the new AMRE system circa 1910.|$|E

30|$|As a consequence, a {{considerable}} amount of the total <b>brake</b> <b>effort</b> should be distributed to traction motors, by performing regenerative or dissipative braking, according to the capability of the overhead line for managing the corresponding recovered power. In particular, not only regenerative but also dissipative electric braking is quite attractive, considering the corresponding reduction of wear of friction braking components such as pads and disks. Since electric braking is applied in parallel with the conventional pneumatic one, an optimized mixing strategy in the usage of both systems, usually called blending, has to be performed.|$|R
2500|$|If {{the brakes}} must be applied before {{recharging}} has been completed, a larger brake pipe reduction {{will be required}} in order to achieve the desired amount of <b>braking</b> <b>effort,</b> as the system is starting out at a lower point of equilibrium (lower overall pressure).

In the DB the permitted top speed was raised from 30 to 45 km/h where compressed-air brakes had been installed. These locos can be easily recognised by their air reservoirs on the front.

40|$|The {{realization}} of movement by railway vehicles creates {{a problem that}} {{is connected to the}} wear process for elements of a tribological wheel–rail system. Wheel–rail wear is a complex phenomenon that depends on many factors. One of the main wear zones is the contact area between a wheel flange and a rail gauge. As is well known, wear in this contact zone occurs when a railway vehicle moves on curved parts of track, realizes tractive, <b>braking</b> <b>efforts</b> or moves in a high-speed mode. In this case, the solution of this kind of wear problem can be found by means of lubricant implementation. The choice of a lubricant requires information about contact characteristics at the moment of a vehicle’s movement.

2500|$|Chrysler {{developed}} a unique braking system, offered from 1949 to 1953.

Because of the expense, the brakes were only standard on the Chrysler Crown and the Town and Country Newport in 1950. They were optional, however, on other Chryslers, priced around $400, {{at a time when}} an entire Crosley Hot Shot retailed for $935.

50|$|Originally, the Class 01's {{top speed}} was {{restricted}} to 120 km/h.

The Deutsche Bundesbahn converted their engines to the smaller Witte smoke deflectors and moved the pumps to the running board in the centre of the vehicle.

2500|$|When it {{had been}} decided to {{transfer}} the Composites to the elevated division of the IRT in 1916, the cars' braking was modernized further. In AMRE schedule braking, the electric brake must be activated at all times by use of the electric brake key to synchronize the train's <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> electrically. If it was not [...] "cut in" [...] or failed en route, the system could still be manipulated to apply the brakes pneumatically. This would still allow the train to stop, but deceleration would take longer such as on the older AM(P) schedule braking. However, in AMRE, the notches in the brake stand to cause this pneumatic application are completely separate from the notches to cause an electric application. Therefore, if a motorman with a defective or inactive electric AMRE brake were to electrically apply the brakes, nothing would happen! Valuable seconds would be lost while he realized his electric brake was inactive, before he could move to the pneumatic apply notch to begin slowing his train down (which would still take longer than usual without electric synchronization of the brakes). In a serious scenario, this could cause him to overshoot a station or an important stopping point, or overspeed. In a new braking schedule known as AMUE, however, the electric and pneumatic notches are joined together on the motorman's brake stand. Therefore, even if the electric brake is defective or inactive, his moving the brake handle to the apply position would still begin setting up a pneumatic application of the brakes, creating a much quicker response to the condition than possible under any other previous system. As part of the modifications for elevated service, the Composites were equipped with AMUE schedule braking from 1916 until their retirement.|$|E

Additionally, a [...] "Variable Load" [...] feature automatically adjusted each car's <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> to compensate for uneven passenger loads in different cars throughout the train.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of adhesion forces for a rail vehicle in tangent and curving parts of track {{is a very}} difficult process because it is connected with use of tractive and <b>braking</b> <b>efforts,</b> and also depends on the contact characteristics in the zone between the wheels and rails.

The existing methods for the estimationcan be used for the creation traction and braking control systems of running gears of rail vehicles. Recently, some publications describe works on study of adhesion forces. The approaches for the detection of these forces in a real time mode have very much in common. From results of this works, it is possible to see that approaches are based on experimental results and use the short time for calculations of wheel-rail contact forces.

40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} work focuses {{on issues of}} vehicle modeling incorporating wheel-terrain interaction and low-level control design taking into account uncertainties and input time delay. Addressing these issues is of significant importance in achieving persistent autonomy for outdoor UGVs, especially when navigating on unprepared terrains. The vehicle is driven in the skid-steering mode, which is popular for many off-road land vehicle platforms. In this {{research work}}, a comprehensive approach is proposed for modeling the dynamics of UGV. The approach considers the difference in speed between two outputs of the differential and the turning mechanism of the vehicle. It describes dynamics of all components in the vehicle driveline in an integrated manner with the vehicle motion. Given a pattern of the throttle position, left and right <b>braking</b> <b>efforts</b> as the inputs, the dynamic behavior of the wheels and other components of the UGV can be predicted. For controlling the vehicle at the low level, PID controllers are firstly used for all actuators. As many components of the vehicle exhibit nonlinearities and time delay, the large overshoots encountered in the outputs can lead to undesirable vehicle behaviors. To alleviate the problem, a novel control approach is proposed for suppression of overshoots resulting from PID control. As a result, the proposed approach can improve significantly system robustness and reduce substantially step response overshoot. Notably, the design is generic in {{that it can be}} applied for many dynamic processes. Knowledge of the interaction between the UGV and the terrain {{plays an important role in}} increasing its autonomy and securing the safety for off-road locomotion. The novel interaction model takes into account the relationship between normal stresses, shear stresses, and shear displacement of the terrain that is in contact with the wheels in deriving the three-dimensional reaction forces. Finally, all modeling and control algorithms are integrated into a unique simulator for emulating the vehicle mobility characteristics. In particular, th...|$|R
