The de-aerated water was taken by the main feed pump (multi stage cartridge design pump or a smaller start up pump) and discharged at [...] into the <b>boiler</b> <b>water</b> feed system through feed regulating valves. Both feed pump types were electric motor driven.

This had the <b>boiler,</b> coal and <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> and everything else encased in a smooth double-ended body reminiscent of a diesel locomotive. The drive was through two six-wheel bogies, each with three cylinders. The axles on each bogie were connected by chains.

The system works well with a measured daily thermal coefficient of performance (COP) of between 1. 3 and 1. 45 for the absorption heat pump.

50|$|Depending on {{the quality}} of the <b>water</b> under <b>supply,</b> it may need to be treated {{chemically}} to eliminate hardness which induces scale buildup on the inside of the locomotive boiler.

[...] External treatment of raw <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> intended for use within a boiler is focused on removal of impurities before they reach the boiler.

50|$|Notwithstanding the {{difficulty}} of theoretical interpretation, measured conductivity is a good indicator of {{the presence or absence}} of conductive ions in solution, and measurements are used extensively in many industries. For example, conductivity measurements are used to monitor quality in public <b>water</b> <b>supplies,</b> in hospitals, in <b>boiler</b> <b>water</b> and industries which depend on water quality such as brewing. This type of measurement is not ion-specific; it can sometimes be used to determine the amount of total dissolved solids (T.D.S.) if the composition of the solution and its conductivity behavior are known.It should be noted that conductivity measurements made to determine water purity will not respond to non conductive contaminants (many organic compounds fall into this category), therefore additional purity tests may be required depending on application.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{principles}} {{based on}} Belgian inventor Alfred Belpaire, Churchward preferred free steaming boilers.

Churchward inherited from Dean a series of parallel cylindrical boilers, but by applying mathematical principles to the flow of <b>boiler</b> <b>water,</b> quickly improved the flow of steam by adopting tapered boilers, which give their largest area {{to the point of}} highest steam production.

5000|$|An aquastat is {{a device}} used in {{hydronic}} heating systems for controlling water temperature. To prevent the boiler from firing too often, aquastats {{have a high}} limit temperature and a low limit. If the thermostat is calling for heat, the boiler will fire until the high limit is reached, then shut off (even if the thermostat is still calling for heat). The boiler will re-fire if the <b>boiler</b> <b>water</b> temperature drops below a range around the high limit. The high limit exists {{for the sake of}} efficiency and safety. The boiler will also fire (regardless of thermostat state) when the <b>boiler</b> <b>water</b> temperature goes below a range around the low limit, ensuring that the <b>boiler</b> <b>water</b> temperature remains above a certain point. The low limit is intended for tankless domestic hot water---it ensures that <b>boiler</b> <b>water</b> is always warm enough to heat the domestic hot water. Many aquastats also have a differential ("diff") control which determines the size of the range around the [...] "low" [...] and/or [...] "high" [...] controls.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Characteristics of <b>boiler</b> feedwater== <b>Water</b> has higher heat {{capacity}} {{than most other}} substances. This quality makes it an ideal raw material for boiler operations. Boilers {{are part of a}} closed system as compared to open systems in a gas turbine. The closed system that is used is the Rankine cycle. This means that the water is recirculated throughout the system and is never in contact with the atmosphere. The water is reused and needs to be treated to continue efficient operations. <b>Boiler</b> <b>water</b> must be treated in order to be proficient in producing steam. <b>Boiler</b> <b>water</b> is treated to prevent scaling, corrosion, foaming, and priming. Chemicals are put into <b>boiler</b> <b>water</b> through the chemical feed tank to keep the water within chemical range. These chemicals are mostly oxygen scavengers and phosphates. The <b>boiler</b> <b>water</b> also has frequent blowdowns {{in order to keep the}} chloride content down. The boiler operations also include bottom blows in order to get rid of solids. Scale is precipitated impurities out of the water and then forms on heat transfer surfaces. This is a problem because scale does not transfer heat very well and causes the tubes to fail by getting too hot. Corrosion is caused by oxygen in the water. The oxygen causes the metal to oxidize which lowers the melting point of the metal. Foaming and priming is caused when the <b>boiler</b> <b>water</b> does not have the correct amount of chemicals and there are suspended solids in the water which carry over in the dry pipe. The dry pipe is where the steam and water mixture are separated.|$|R
