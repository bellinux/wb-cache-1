5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland <b>built</b> <b>its</b> first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary sewer system {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E
5|$|Haifa's {{development}} owed much to British {{plans to}} make it a central port and hub for Middle-East crude oil. The British Government of Palestine developed the port and built refineries, thereby facilitating the rapid development of the city as a center for the country's heavy industries. Haifa was also among the first towns to be fully electrified. The Palestine Electric Company inaugurated the Haifa Electrical Power Station already in 1925, opening the door to considerable industrialization. The State-run Palestine Railways also <b>built</b> <b>its</b> main workshops in Haifa.|$|E
5|$|The Smashing Pumpkins {{broke into}} the musical {{mainstream}} with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream.

With 21million albums sold in the United States alone, The Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up.|$|E

5|$|This trend {{continued}} {{and increases in}} the production of hydroelectric power are directly related to industrial development. In 2005, Landsvirkjun produced 7,143 GWh of electricity total of which 6,676 GWh or 93% was produced via hydroelectric power plants. Additionally 5,193 GWh or 72% was used for power-intensive industries like aluminum smelting. In 2009 Iceland <b>built</b> <b>its</b> biggest hydroelectric project to date, a 690 MW hydroelectric plant to provide energy for another aluminum smelter — the Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant. This project was opposed strongly by environmentalists.|$|E
5|$|Dawson Creek is a {{regional}} node for air, rail, and bus services. The Dawson Creek Airport, which services commercial flights by Central Mountain Air, {{was built in}} 1963; its 1,524m (5,000ft) runway was paved in 1966. There are larger airports in Fort St. John and Grande Prairie that maintain more comprehensive flight schedules. Passenger rail service was available in Dawson Creek between 1931 and 1974. Service began when the Northern Alberta Railways (NAR) <b>built</b> <b>its</b> northwest terminus in the town and was extended in 1958 to Vancouver with a rail line through the Rocky Mountains. Passenger rail service ended as commodity shipments of grains, oil and gas by-products, and forestry products became {{more important in the}} resource-based economy. Greyhound Lines maintains a bus station in Dawson Creek which connects the city to Vancouver, Edmonton (via Grande Prairie), and Whitehorse (via Fort Nelson).|$|E

5|$|During the 1920s, the American Budd Company, at {{the time}} a {{relatively}} obscure auto-frame supplier, developed an extensive working relationship with the French firm Michelin, which was best known for its tires. In 1929, Michelin <b>built</b> <b>its</b> first rail car, and by 1932 nine of its cars were in operating service, all of which featured innovative and distinctive pneumatic tires. The company claimed that its application of tires on its rail cars afforded both a substantially more cushioned ride and increased the cars' traction by 35%. The design of Michelin's tired wheels included an aluminum safety ring and a flange that were only used {{in the event of a}} puncture or other type of tire failure; during normal operation, only the rubber tire made contact with the rail.|$|E
5|$|GO {{has always}} owned its {{locomotives}} and coaches, but its trackage {{used to be}} owned entirely by Canada's two major commercial railways: the large majority by the Canadian National Railway (CN) and the remainder (the current Milton line) by Canadian Pacific Railway (CP). In 1988, as part of expanding service east of Pickering, GO <b>built</b> <b>its</b> first section of self-owned purpose-built trackage. From 1998 until 2009, GO owned only 6% of the railway trackage on which it operated. Starting in 2009, Metrolinx incrementally acquired further trackage from the two commercial railways {{in order to improve}} GO service. As of 2014, Metrolinx has complete ownership of the Barrie, Stouffville and Lakeshore East lines, and a majority of the Lakeshore West, Richmond Hill, and Kitchener lines. CP still owns most of the Milton line. This puts Metrolinx ownership at 80% of GO Transit's trackage.|$|E
5|$|In 1282, Edward I of England {{conquered the}} principality of Wales and divided the area into counties. One of {{thirteen}} traditional counties in Wales, Cardiganshire {{was also a}} vice-county. Cardiganshire was split into the five hundreds of Genau'r-Glyn, Ilar, Moyddyn, Penarth and Troedyraur. In the 18th century there was an evangelical revival of Christianity, and non-conformism became established in the county as charismatic preachers like Daniel Rowland of Llangeitho attracted large congregations. Every community <b>built</b> <b>its</b> own chapel or meeting house, and Cardiganshire {{became one of the}} centres of Methodism in Wales with the Aeron Valley being at the centre of the revival.|$|E

It departed the Los Angeles area on April 15 for Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, and shipped aboard the USS Argentina for Europe on May 3. The 479th arrived in Scotland on May 14, 1944, and entrained for RAF Wattisham, England, where it arrived the next day.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} several decades, South Framingham became an {{important}} regional rail hub. The Boston and Worcester <b>built</b> <b>its</b> 12-mile Milford Branch from South Framingham to Milford via Holliston in 1848. The next year, the B built a short branch to Framingham Center, which the B mainline had bypassed. This line, later called the Agricultural Branch Railroad, was realigned near Framingham Center and extended to Pratts Junction in Sterling in 1855. Franklin Street {{was built on the}} former branch right of way. The Agricultural Branch and the Framingham & Lowell (which branched off it at Framingham Center) were the northernmost section of the Old Colony Railroad, which took over the lines in 1879.|$|E
5|$|The Church had its {{beginnings}} in 1926 just as Mexico {{plunged into a}} violent struggle between the anti-clerical government and Catholic rebels. The conflict centered in the west-central states like Jalisco, where González focused his missionary efforts. Given {{the environment of the}} time, La Luz del Mundo remained a small missionary endeavor until 1934 when it <b>built</b> <b>its</b> first temple. Thereafter the Church continued to grow and expand, interrupted only by an internal schism in 1942. Apostles: Aarón Joaquín is believed to be designated the ministry of the Lord by revelation of God, then his son Samuel; thereafter by his son Naasón. The Church is now present in 50 countries and has between 1 and 7 million adherents worldwide.|$|E

Birger Jarl sank in an accident in 1813 and Erik Segersäll was planned for conversion as a paddlewheel steam battery for coastal defense, though the idea was eventually abandoned and the ship scrapped in 1826.|$|E
5|$|The early {{settlers}} of Minnesota were anxiously seeking railroad transportation, but insufficient {{capital was}} available after the Panic of 1857. Rails were finally built in Minnesota in 1862, when the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad <b>built</b> <b>its</b> first ten miles (16km) of track from the Phalen Creek area in St. Paul {{to a stop}} just short of St. Anthony Falls. The railroad continued building track from Minneapolis to Elk River in 1864 and to St. Cloud in 1866, and from Minneapolis west to Howard Lake in 1867 and Willmar in 1869. Meanwhile, the Minnesota Central, an early predecessor of the Milwaukee Road, built a line from Minneapolis to Fort Snelling in 1865. The railroad gradually extended to Faribault, Owatonna, and Austin. It crossed the Iowa border and met up with the McGregor & Western line. This connection gave Minneapolis rail service to Milwaukee via Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, with through service beginning on October 14, 1867.|$|E
5|$|By May 1940, Castle Bromwich {{had not yet}} <b>built</b> <b>its</b> first Spitfire, {{in spite}} of {{promises}} that the factory would be producing 60 per week starting in April. On 17 May, Minister of Aircraft Production Lord Beaverbrook telephoned Lord Nuffield and manoeuvred him into handing {{over control of the}} Castle Bromwich plant to his Ministry. Beaverbrook immediately sent in experienced management staff and experienced workers from Supermarine and gave over control of the factory to Vickers-Armstrong. Although it would take some time to resolve the problems, in June 1940, 10 Mk IIs were built; 23 rolled out in July, 37 in August, and 56 in September. By the time production ended at Castle Bromwich in June 1945, a total of 12,129 Spitfires (921 Mk IIs, 4,489 Mk Vs, 5,665 Mk IXs, and 1,054 Mk XVIs) had been built. CBAF {{went on to become the}} largest and most successful plant of its type during the 1939–45 conflict. As the largest Spitfire factory in the UK, by producing a maximum of 320 aircraft per month, it built over half of the approximately 20,000 aircraft of this type.|$|E
