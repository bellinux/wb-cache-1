50|$|The enamel {{workshops}} {{within the}} Byzantine Empire likely perfected their techniques through their connections with Classical Greek examples. The Greeks were already experts in enameling, soldering a filagree onto {{a flat base}} and later adding a paste of glass, or a liquid flux, to the <b>base</b> <b>piece.</b> The entire work was then fired, melting the glass paste into the frame to create the finished work. Occasionally, the ancient Greek craftsman would apply the glass flux to the base {{with the aid of}} a brush. The Romans, who were experienced in glass production already, would carve a recess into the base plate and then pour glass flux into each enclosure. The metal peeking through between the recessed glass would create the outline of the image. This technique is called champlevé, and is considerably easier than the cloisonné form of enameling practiced by the Greeks and Byzantines.|$|E

40|$|Cytochrome f/b 6 and ATP {{synthetase}} (CF 0 -CF 1) complexes from spinach chloroplasts {{have been}} reconstituted into liposomes prepared from soybean phospholipids and purified spinach galactolipids. Freeze- fracture analysis revealed homogeneous populations of particles spanning the lipid bilayers with their elongated axes {{perpendicular to the}} membrane plane. The lipid composition of the liposomes {{had no effect on}} the size of the reconstituted complexes, the average diameter of cytochrome f/b 6 complex measuring 8. 5 nm, and of the CF 0 <b>base</b> <b>piece</b> of the ATP synthetase, 9. 5 nm. When reconstituted cytochrome f/b 6 complexes were cross-linked by means of antibodies prepared against the whole complex, the thus aggregated particles formed either hexagonal or square arrays. In both instances the center-to-center spacing of the particles was 8. 3 nm, thereby suggesting that this value could be closer to the real diameter of the complexes than the one obtained from measuring individual particles. Assuming an ellipsoidal shape for these particles, and using a measured height of 11 nm, a molecular weight of approximately 280, 000 could be calculated for the reconstituted cytochrome f/b 6 complex, consistent with a dimeric configuration. In many instances the crystalline sheets of antibody-aggregated cytochrome f/b 6 complexes were found to be free in the buffer solution; apparently the antibody-induced strains caused the sheet-like aggregates to pop out of the liposomal membranes. Agglutination studies of inside-out and right-side-out thylakoid vesicles revealed the antigenic determinants of the cytochrome f and cytochrome b 6 polypeptides to be exposed on the inner thylakoid surface and to be present in stacked and unstacked membrane regions. The molecular weight calculated from the size of freeze-fractured CF 0 base pieces was over twice the value determined by x-ray scattering data. This discrepancy may be caused by significant lipid domains within the <b>base</b> <b>piece,</b> or by an unusual fracturing behavior of the <b>base</b> <b>piece</b> in reconstituted liposomes...|$|E

40|$|The {{unauthorized}} copying of software {{is often referred}} to as software piracy. Soft- ware piracy causes billions of dollars of annual losses for companies and governments worldwide. In this project, we analyze a method for detecting software piracy. A meta- morphic generator is used to create morphed copies of a <b>base</b> <b>piece</b> of software. A hidden Markov Model is trained on the opcode sequences extracted from these mor- phed copies. The trained model is then used to score suspect software to determine its similarity to the base software. A high score indicates that the suspect software may be a modified version of the base software and, therefore, further investigation is warranted. In contrast, a low score indicates that the suspect software differs sig- nificantly from the base software. We show that our approach is robust, in the sense that the base software must be extensively modified before it is not detected...|$|E

40|$|A repeating {{particle}} {{associated with}} the cristae and the inner membrane of the external envelope has been recognized and characterized in beef heart mitochondria by correlated electron microscopic and biochemical studies. Many thousands (ca. 104 to 105) of these particles, disposed in regular arrays, are present in a single mitochondrion. The repeating particle, called the elementary particle (EP), consists of three parts: (1) a spherical or polyhedral head piece (80 to 100 A in diameter); (2) a cylindrical stalk (about 50 A long and 30 to 40 A wide); and (3) a <b>base</b> <b>piece</b> (40 X 110 A).

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that automation can improve industrial pipe lifting productivity. However, there is little information on finding how much productivity can be improved in the other parts of pipe erection processes to coordinate with the productivity improvement in pipe lifting. The processes of piping construction include pipe delivery, pipe lifting, pipe alignment, pipe connection, and pipe inspection & connection. This paper studied the potential productivity improvement by simulating the process of piping operations in order to synchronize with the productivity improvement in piping lifting. This paper is based in part on previous findings from studies performed by Glass and Fisher at the University of Texas at Austin in 1984 and 1989. The semi-automated environment for piping erection assumes a Grove Pipe Manipulator attached to the boom nose of a 22 -ton crane as the <b>base</b> <b>piece</b> of equipment for piping erection. A system model is established to simulate and analyze the process of piping construction. A simulation technique is developed in this study to identify the possible critical tasks and the factors of obstruction in the process of piping construction that would eliminate the productivity improvement in piping erection...|$|E

40|$|The task of {{this study}} was to examine post exodontia {{dynamics}} that lead to the use of an equine dental spacer on cheek teeth. Research involved the conceptualization of a spacer, which should negate a variety of undesirable consequences resulting from tooth removal. The application of the spacer should be non traumatic and easy for the practitioner to handle as well as economically feasible for the owner. Additionally, the newly designed spacers were to be tested on the patient. The cited literature is extensive and provided detailed information, for example, on how to approach the sedated standing patient, which can be manipulated in the mouth for a longer period of time. Information on cheek tooth replacement was limited and almost no practical solutions for the treatment of pathological consequences of a cheek tooth gap without general anaesthesia were found. Moreover, indications of long term effects in the dentition after cheek tooth removal appeared to be incomplete and the potential of specific tooth replacement was not discussed. Dentition radiographs of 70 patients (42 were studied clinically within this paper) and 4 sculls served to examine whether teeth move after exodontia, which teeth move, where teeth move, reason for movement, the rate of speed at which teeth move, and lastly the width of movement. Additionally, the factors influencing movement and the pathologies created by these movements were investigated. Radial calculations on the skulls, the radiographs and the clinical examinations which included dental gap impressions revealed that in all cases studied (P 2, P 3, M 1, M 2; n = 66) the teeth adjacent to the gap tipped quickly in the first few months, while later the rate of tipping declined. The tipping process terminated when teeth met and led to pathological conditions in all patients of the study. According to the requirements, dental spacers were constructed from horse teeth, urethane plugs and from metal. The spacers were tested on skulls, slaughter heads, and patients. While initially spacers had to be therapeutically effective, practicable, easy and gently to use as well as cost effective, demands on the spacer evolved to be additionally applicable for tipping correction, stable to anchor, usable on the standing patient and medically unobjectionable. Moreover the evolution of the final spacer design necessitated the use of a Dremel tool for application, whereas the prior designs were applied with adhesive, intraoral steel pins, and activated with a custom made long handled wrench. The use of the Dremel tool as a drill in the last design was to bore holes in the adjacent teeth to apply the spacer. The spacer was inserted into the holes by spring-loaded nipples and then activated by adjusting a threaded mechanism to the correct gap width. Thereby, the idea of a fast and easy adaptable plastic spacer which can be pressed in the tooth gap had to be renounced. With most models it was difficult to insert the spacer into the maxilla without causing trauma to the soft tissues. Although model 13 b (adjusting screw without tooth pieces, <b>base</b> <b>piece</b> and side piece; passive fixation through spring-loaded nipples, which snap into tooth borings) could not be tested due to the lack of an appropriate dental drill, preliminary results indicated that only this model may meet all criteria for a dental spacer...|$|E
