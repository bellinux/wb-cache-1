Anwar explained to the camera that he needed to do it because their family was so poor. [...] "That's tough", commented Water, [...] "because that's a dishonour to his family." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{have said}} that All That You Can't Leave Behind was an album that {{acknowledged}} the band's past. For example, there was a <b>big</b> <b>debate</b> amongst the band members during the writing and recording of [...] "Beautiful Day"; The Edge was playing with a guitar tone {{that he had not}} used much since their 1983 album War and the band wanted something more forward-looking. The Edge won out and the tone made it into the final studio version of the song. Additionally, although the record was described as [...] "a return to the traditional U2 sound", many songs were complex and retained elements of the band's 1990s experimenting; [...] "Beautiful Day" [...] features an electronic drum beat, and the song's intro features an [...] "electronification of the [...] chords with a beat box and a string part"; [...] "New York" [...] came together when the band members were away at a meeting and Lanois and Eno were playing around with a drum loop that Mullen had recorded. The album's recording wrapped up in 2000.|$|E

As {{most would}} know, the {{question}} has gained national attention largely {{through the efforts of}} Keith Windschuttle who, in four "Quadrant" articles in 2000 and 2001, argued, among other things, that historians had inflated the numbers of Aborigines killed on the Australian frontier and that the National Museum of Australia's 'Contested Frontiers' exhibit contained factual errors. In December 2001 the National Museum organised a conference that brought together Windschuttle and many of the historians he had criticised.

More specifically, the analysis focuses on the implications of, and the reporting on, the "caricature-debate" 2005 / 6. Commonly used, mostly negative stereotypes and frames regarding Muslims are detected; moreover, the genesis of "enemy images" is made explicit through detailed discourse analysis. In sum: alternative discourses have to be created which deconstruct the "binary reductionism". Hence, other opinions, voices and positions should find access to the media and become visible.

40|$|One of the <b>biggest</b> <b>debates</b> in impact {{investing}} is whether investors must sacrifice financial return {{to achieve their}} desired social or environmental impact.

But when the researchers compared the impact-investing funds' performance to the Russell 2000 and other public market indices, they saw that the funds had achieved comparable financial results without the companies they invested in abandoning their social or environmental missions...|$|R

The high watermark of this Dutch contribution {{can be found in the}} period 1680 - 1730. After this, and closely related to the decrease in urbanization and the social problems associated with economic decline, the Dutch Enlightenment would acquire a character all of its own, unfamiliar to other Europeans. </p...|$|R
