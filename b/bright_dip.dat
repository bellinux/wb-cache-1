40|$|The {{evaporative}} {{recovery and}} wastewater treatment systems installed for an anodizing and plating plant {{are discussed in}} this wpor. The performance of the systems is sufficiently effective to meet "four-day averages " proposed by EPA for discharges to POW. The plating department at Weiser Lock Co., a division of Norris Industries in Huntington Beach, CA, has been in operation since November 1978. It includes one semiautomatic and six automatic plating machines, a manual plating line, and a burnishing area-all located on the ground floor. Wastewater from this equipment flows by gravity to chemical treatment systems located in a basement area directly below the plating department. Figure 1 depicts the basic design concepts of the plating/recovery/treatment layout. A further description of the plant has been published elsewhere. ' The characteristics of the wastewater {{are similar to those}} found in effluent from most decorative plating plants.

This implies that the complex spectral changes in the X-ray continua observed from dip sources can be mostly explained by changes in the highly-ionized absorbers present in these systems.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{corrosion}} behavior of AlSi 10 Mg alloy produced by {{direct metal laser sintering}} (DMLS). Potentiodynamic tests were performed in aerated diluted Harrison solution, on specimens with different orientation {{with respect to}} the building plane. Different surface finishing were analyzed, covering rough surfaces as produced by DMLS and after polishing by means of emery papers and alumina slurry or chemical polishing with phosphoric and nitric acid <b>bright</b> <b>dipping</b> (BD). A conversion treatment by short immersion in Ce(III) salt solution was evaluated in order to improve corrosion resistance of both as-produced surface and polished surface. Selective attack of α-Al phase occurs at the border of the melting pools, typical of DMLS process, and slightly reduces on transversal planes, perpendicular to the building plane. Acid pickling slightly improves the corrosion resistance of as-produced surface, but no positive effects were noticed on polished one. The Ce(III) conversion treatment does not inhibit corrosion on as-produced specimens. Its effectiveness is higher on polished and pickled specimens. On polished surface, the effectiveness of conversion treatment mainly depends on plane orientatio...|$|R
40|$|Anodizing of {{aluminum}} {{is a fascinating}} technical study and a practical finishing system of great commercial importance. This paper will discuss coil anodizing as {{an important part of}} the anodizing industry. Some unpublished information on the range of organic sulfonic acids which could be used for integral color anodizing is covered. A theory regarding the movement of chromium in the barrier layer during the anodizing is proposed. Some ideas on the mechanism of sealing, the resulting anodic coating structure, and the usefullness of incremental dissolution in studying these phenomena are described. Coil anodizing Coil anodizing is a branch of commercial anodizing which has received little notice in the technical literature 1. Electrochemically coil anodizing is identicd to piece part anodizing, but the material handling is quite different. A coil of rolled aluminum is mounted on the payoff chuck and the sheet is pulled over and under rolls through a line of tanks in which the various individual treatments are accomplished.

40|$|X-ray {{observations}} {{have revealed}} that many microquasars and low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) exhibit narrow absorption features identified with resonant absorption from Fe XXV and Fe XXVI and other abundant ions. In many well studied systems there is evidence for blue-shifts, indicating outflowing plasmas. We succesfully model the changes in both the X-ray continuum and the Fe absorption features during dips from all the <b>bright</b> <b>dipping</b> LMXBs observed by XMM-Newton (EXO 0748 - 676, XB 1254 - 690, X 1624 - 490, MXB 1659 - 298, 4 U 1746 - 371 and XB 1916 - 053) as resulting primarily from an increase in column density {{and a decrease in}} the ionization state of a highly-ionized absorber in a similar way as was done for 4 U 1323 - 62. This implies that the complex spectral changes in the X-ray continua observed from the dip sources as a class can be most simply explained primarily by changes in the highly ionized absorbers present in these systems. There is no need to invoke unusual abundances or partial covering of extended emission regions. Outside of the dips, the absorption line properties do not vary strongly with orbital phase. This implies that the ionized plasma has a cylindrical geometry with a maximum column density close to the plane of the accretion disk. Since dipping sources are simply normal LMXBs viewed from close to the orbital plane this implies that ionized plasmas are a common feature of LMXBs.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{spectral}} {{analysis of a}} large set of XMM-Newton observations of EXO 0748 - 676, a <b>bright</b> <b>dipping</b> LMXB. In particular, {{we focus on the}} dipping phenomenon as a result of changes in the properties of the ionised gas close to the source. Using the high-resolution spectra collected with the RGS, we explored two simple geometrical scenarios for which we derived physical quantities of the absorbing material like the density, size, and mass. We find that the continuum is absorbed by a neutral gas, and by both a collisionally (temperature T 70 eV) and photoionised (ionisation parameter logξ 2. 5) absorbers. Emission lines from OVII and OVIII are also detected. This {{is the first time that}} evidence of a collisionally ionised absorber has been found in a low-mass X-ray binary. The collisionally ionised absorber may be in the form of dense (n> 10 ^ 14 cm^- 3) filaments, located at a distance r> 10 ^ 11 cm. During dips, the photoionised absorber significantly increases its column density (factor 2 [...] 4) while becoming less ionised. This strengthens the idea that the colder material of the accretion stream impinging the disc is passing on our line of sight during dips. We find that the distance from the neutron star to the impact region (5 x 10 ^ 10 cm) is similar to the size of the neutron star's Roche lobe. The gas observed during the persistent state may have a flattened geometry. Finally, we explore the possibility of the existence of material forming an initial, hotter portion of a circumbinary disc.

40|$|We {{present results}} of a {{detailed}} study of X-ray flaring in the Z-track source Sco X- 1 in a highly super-Eddington state made using high quality Rossi-XTE data from the PCA and HEXTE instruments. The emission model successfully used to explain the dipping LMXB, and other classes of LMXB in recent years, was applied to study the physical evolution along the Z-track which remains a major problem. This model consists of blackbody emission from the neutron star plus Comptonized emission from an extended accretion disk corona. As found in earlier work, major changes {{take place in the}} neutron star blackbody emission with kT increasing in flaring, and the blackbody radius R BB increasing substantially to a maximum value of 9. 4 ± 0. 6 km, consistent with the radius of the neutron star, after which R BB decreases. Thus this result is a measurement of neutron star radius. The behaviour of Sco X- 1 in flaring is compared with our previous results for the strong flaring that takes place in the <b>bright</b> <b>dipping,</b> flaring LMXB X 1624 - 490. Remarkably, during movement along the Normal Branch towards the apex with the Flaring Branch, the luminosities of both spectral components decrease, suggesting the possibility that M may decrease on the Normal Branch, contrary to the widely-held view that M increases monotonically along the Z-track. During flaring, we detect for the first time an increase of the Comptonization cut-off energy which may suggest heating of the ADC plasma by the neutron star flare. The energy of a broad Gaussian line at 6. 4 keV does not change, but the intensity of the line increases in flaring suggesting either an increase in ADC size in flaring or the effects of irradiation by the neutron star. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{luminosity}} function (LF) of the Pleiades cluster stars {{was constructed}} {{for the study}} of the LF fine structure related to pre-MS stellar evolution. Theoretical luminosity functions based on present-day pre-MS and MS stellar models were constructed and compared with observations. We tested both power- and log-normal laws describing the cluster star IMF. Both single star formation burst- and age spread-models were examined. The agreement between the observed Pleiades CMD with the new HIPPARCOS distance and the theoretical ZAMS for a normal metallicity is excellent when the model positions in the HRD are corrected to the helium abundance Y= 0. 34. The corresponding age of the cluster is log t = 7. 95. Three features (dips) were found in the observed cluster LF in a magnitude range MV = 5 m – 12 m. Two of them (at MV = 7. 5 m and 9. 5 m) are assumed to be field LF features: Wielen and Kroupa dips. Theoretical models fail to reproduce them. We attributed the third (<b>brightest)</b> detail (the <b>dip</b> at MV = 5. 5 m) to the pre-MS evolution of Pleiades stars. The observed Pleiades LF corresponds in its brighter part to the standard Population I IMF. The log-normal IMF fits the observations much better than a simple power-law IMF. The brightest LF feature could be reproduced in the theoretical LF if a substantial age spread of order of several tens of Myrs is supposed to exist among the Pleiades stars.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} principally ROSAT and HST {{observations of}} magnetic (or proposed magnetic) cataclysmic variables. Chapter 2 details a ROSAT {{observation of the}} polar EK UMa. The orbital light curve reveals a single bright phase. During this <b>bright</b> phase deep <b>dips</b> in the flux are seen, consistent with accretion stream occultation. The soft X-ray spectrum has an unusually high temperature of 50 KTBB 62 eV. No hard X-ray flux is detected. Chapter 3 details ROSAT observations of proposed intermediate polars SW UMa and 1 H 0709 - 360. The previously reported X-ray/optical periodicities in SW UMa were not detected. Spectral analysis indicates a two-temperature model is appropriate. The weak signal from 1 H 0709 - 360 precludes a detailed spectral analysis. 1 H 0709 - 360 has dropped in flux by ~ 2 orders of magnitude since its detection. The intermediate polar classification of these two systems remains unconfirmed. Chapter 4 describes ROSAT and contemporaneous optical and HST observations of the intermediate polar AE Aqr. During this observation X-ray flares were detected for the first time. The white dwarf spin modulated count rate increased only slightly with increased intensity. AE Aqr has an unusually soft spectrum which is only fit by a two temperature optically thin plasma emission model. Chapters 5 and 6 detail ROSAT, HST, EUVE and complementary optical observations of the polar QS Tel. The soft X-ray/EUV data showed a bright-faint morphology. The EUVE observations, ~ 1 year later, revealed a change in morphology, indicating that both poles were active. A deep narrow dip is observed in both the ROSAT and EUVE observations. The HST (FOS) observation had a mean spectrum of an underlying continuum with strong emission lines superposed. Orbital modulation was present in both.
