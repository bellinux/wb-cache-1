40|$|Training the <b>bench</b> press {{exercise}} on a traditional flat <b>bench</b> does not induce {{a level of}} instability as seen in sport movements and activities of daily living. Twenty participants were recruited to test two forms of instability: using one dumbbell rather than two and lifting on the COR <b>bench</b> compared to a flat <b>bench.</b> Electromyography (EMG) amplitudes of the pectoralis major, middle trapezius, external oblique, and internal oblique were recorded and compared. Differences in range of motion (ROM) were evaluated by measuring an angular representation of the shoulder complex. Four separate conditions of unilateral <b>bench</b> press were tested while lifting on a: flat <b>bench</b> with one dumbbell, flat <b>bench</b> with two dumbbells, COR <b>Bench</b> with one dumbbell, and COR <b>Bench</b> with two dumbbells.

5|$|Sanchez {{started the}} next week, but was <b>benched</b> {{in the third}} quarter of the Jets' contest against the Arizona Cardinals on December 2, 2012 in favor of third string back-up Greg McElroy. Prior to being <b>benched</b> by Rex Ryan, Sanchez threw three interceptions. McElroy threw a {{touchdown}} to tight end Jeff Cumberland to score the team's only points in a 7–6 victory over Arizona. Rex Ryan renamed Sanchez the starting quarterback the following Wednesday after seeking out multiple opinions within the organization. Sanchez returned to complete 12 his 19 passes for 111 yards against the Jacksonville Jaguars, fumbling once that led to a Jaguar field goal. The Jets won 17–10. In a must-win game against the Tennessee Titans to remain in playoff contention, Sanchez struggled; he completed 13 of his 28 passes for 131 yards while throwing four interceptions and fumbling the ball in Titans territory in the closing minutes of the Jets' 14–10 defeat. A day later, Ryan named McElroy the starter. Sanchez started the Jets' final game against the Buffalo Bills after McElroy revealed he had been experiencing concussion symptoms in the days preceding. The Jets were defeated 28–9 with Sanchez completing 17 of his 35 passes for 205 yards and two turnovers.|$|E
5|$|After Euro 2004, Juventus manager Marcello Lippi was {{replaced}} by Fabio Capello.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{perforated}} <b>bench</b> {{is to reduce the}} air humidity beneath the plant canopy without excessive energy consumption. A <b>bench</b> heating system with heating pipes under a perforated <b>bench</b> with skirts creates an airflow through the <b>bench</b> openings due to buoyancy forces. Because the heated air is relatively dry compared to the surrounding air, it has a moisture absorbing and transporting capacity. The moisture transporting capacity will be decrease, thereby reducing the advantages of the perforated <b>bench,</b> if airflow rate is impeded by the <b>bench</b> structure, plant shape or leaf area index. Thus the airflow rate is of importance for the performance of a perforated <b>bench.</b> In an experimental setup the airflow rate was determined for different perforated <b>bench</b> designs with and without plants. Measurements were carried out with five different plant types on four <b>bench</b> designs. It was found that the airflow rate was effected by the design of the perforated <b>bench,</b> but on the same type of <b>bench</b> the effect of plant type and leaf area index was insignificant. A model to predict the airflow rate for each <b>bench</b> design as a function of temperature difference created by the <b>bench</b> heating system for the investigated <b>bench</b> designs is presented...|$|R
5|$|After Leaf threw four {{interceptions in}} the first half against the New York Giants in the Week 4 game (September 28), coach Kevin Gilbride <b>benched</b> Leaf in favor of Craig Whelihan.

Indianapolis won 17–12, as both quarterbacks completed 12 of 23 passes with an interception each, but Leaf threw for 160 yards (23 more than Manning), and only Manning threw a touchdown. Manning was never sacked; Leaf was sacked four times. Inside the final two minutes and San Diego down 14–6, Leaf's 56-yard pass to Charlie Jones set up a one-yard Natrone Means touchdown run, but Leaf's potential tying two-point conversion pass to Webster Slaughter was incomplete.|$|E
5|$|After Leafs General Manager Pat Quinn {{was unwilling}} to give Joseph a {{four-year}} contract (he offered three years), he left after the 2001–02 season to sign with the Detroit Red Wings. Some also speculated {{that the relationship between}} Quinn and Joseph was frosty because Quinn had <b>benched</b> Joseph in the Salt Lake City Olympics after the first game, although Joseph himself denied the rumours, saying that he played a bad first game against Sweden (losing 5–2) and that Martin Brodeur played very well {{for the rest of the}} tournament, earning his spot as the starter. Joseph had also hinted at wanting to play for a team that could win it all, implying the Leafs were not such a team. Joseph's move to Detroit was highly publicized and unpopular in Toronto.|$|E

After the Jets finished the season with a disappointing 8–8 record, Ryan admitted to having lost the pulse of the team.
