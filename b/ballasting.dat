5|$|In 1998, the Marine Racecar Board of the National Academy of Science {{conducted}} a survey of industry experts regarding {{the pros and cons}} of double-hull design. Some of the advantages of the double-hull design that were mentioned include ease of <b>ballasting</b> in emergency situations, reduced practice of saltwater <b>ballasting</b> in cargo tanks decreases corrosion, increased environmental protection, cargo discharge is quicker, more complete and easier, tank washing is more efficient, and better protection in low-impact collisions and grounding.|$|E
5|$|Incorrect {{unloading}} sequences and <b>ballasting</b> {{which resulted}} in the buoyancy of the hull becoming uneven and the hull therefore strained: Lack of crew training or knowing malpractice were possible explanations. Total was held largely to blame for this. However, given that all the personnel involved in the unloading had died in the explosion, it was difficult to be certain as to what had happened.|$|E
5|$|Prior to any {{transfer}} of cargo, the chief officer must develop a transfer plan detailing {{specifics of the}} operation such as how much cargo will be moved, which tanks will be cleaned, and how the ship's <b>ballasting</b> will change. The next step before a transfer is the pretransfer conference. The pretransfer conference covers issues such as what products will be moved, the order of movement, names and titles of key people, particulars of shipboard and shore equipment, critical states of the transfer, regulations in effect, emergency and spill-containment procedures, watch and shift arrangements, and shutdown procedures.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- <b>Ballast</b> flying {{problems}} obsess the <b>ballasted</b> {{high speed}} railway, its microscopic mechanics {{is less of}} discovered. In the paper, the railway <b>ballast</b> particle force equilibrium is analyzed through basic mechanics and mathematic formula, and a model is set up to discover the factors and influence. The microscopic <b>ballast</b> flying model is used for <b>ballast</b> bed geometry and <b>ballast</b> shape optimization, and guide the <b>ballast</b> flying countering methods. Results show that <b>ballast</b> flying particle is correlated with <b>ballast</b> shape and mass, especially the <b>ballast</b> shape mass ratio corresponds to operation speed. <b>Ballast</b> interlock ability governs the <b>ballast</b> flying possibility and severity. <b>Ballast</b> flying possibility increases with <b>ballast</b> bed acceleration. The paper focus on <b>ballast</b> particle force equilibration, shape and mass, under the condition of vibration and wind effects, the <b>ballast</b> flying mechanism is analyzed and discussed with related counteracting methods presented.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation {{is to develop a}} <b>ballast</b> quality evaluation computer model based on the relations among the <b>ballast</b> particle characteristics and <b>ballast</b> performance. ^ Much effort has been given in the past to seek suitable criteria for <b>ballast</b> material selection considering <b>ballast</b> performance and maintenance costs. But the selection of <b>ballast</b> material has appeared to be based on limited information without full regard to the effect of <b>ballast</b> particle characteristics on the ability of <b>ballast</b> to fulfill its functions in track. This will result in some misjudgments in the <b>ballast</b> material selection. ^ The developed model can quantify the <b>ballast</b> suitability with a <b>ballast</b> quality index which has taken the basic <b>ballast</b> particle characteristics and the main <b>ballast</b> field functions into consideration. The basic <b>ballast</b> particle characteristics included are shape, angularity, surface texture, gradation, and specific gravity. The main <b>ballast</b> field functions for track are providing resistance forces, resiliency, void storage, drainage, and facilitating maintenance. The <b>ballast</b> particle characteristics are numerically related to the <b>ballast</b> field functions based on available data from field and laboratory tests on granular materials and some assumptions. Weighting factors are used to represent the relative importance of the basic <b>ballast</b> particle characteristics to each <b>ballast</b> function and then the relative importance of the main <b>ballast</b> functions to the overall <b>ballast</b> field performance. ^ The developed model is evaluated using the <b>ballast</b> field data related to the track performance. The verification results show that the developed <b>ballast</b> quality index can reflect the <b>ballast</b> quality. ...|$|R

5|$|Specialized bulk {{carriers}} {{began to appear}} as steam-powered ships became more popular. The first steam ship recognized as a bulk carrier was the British coal carrier SS John Bowes in 1852. She featured a metal hull, a steam engine, and a <b>ballasting</b> system which used seawater instead of sandbags. These features helped her succeed in the competitive British coal market. The first self-unloader was the lake freighter Hennepin in 1902 on the Great Lakes. This greatly decreased the unloading time of bulkers by using conveyor belt to move the cargo. The first bulkers with diesel propulsion {{began to appear in}} 1911.|$|E
5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel with double sides adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already required to have double bottoms. One of the advantages of the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double sides also improve a ship's capacity for <b>ballasting,</b> which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|E

50|$|Conversion bulbs are {{manufactured}} so {{they work with}} either a MH or HPS <b>ballast.</b> A grower can run an HPS conversion bulb on a MH <b>ballast,</b> or a MH conversion bulb on a HPS <b>ballast.</b> The difference between the <b>ballasts</b> is an HPS <b>ballast</b> has an igniter which ignites the sodium in an HPS bulb, while a MH <b>ballast</b> does not. Because of this, all electrical <b>ballasts</b> can fire MH bulbs, but only a Switchable or HPS <b>ballast</b> can fire an HPS bulb without a conversion bulb. Usually a metal halide conversion bulb {{will be used in}} an HPS <b>ballast</b> since the MH conversion bulbs are more common.|$|R

25|$|Less {{than two}} months prior to her sinking, on 7 October 2014 Cemfjord was left with a list in the Pentland Firth, after her cargo shifted.

50|$|After {{the track}} renewal train completes the tasks, the <b>ballast</b> {{will be put}} back on the track.

The reusable <b>ballast</b> will be put back to the new track together with the new <b>ballast</b> materials. For track renewal trains that do not include track copying or leveling, a <b>ballast</b> tamper will be used to make final adjustments to the track to the correct specification. A <b>ballast</b> regulator will then be used to make the final shape of the <b>ballast.</b>|$|R
25|$|By {{the spring}} of 1847, {{portions}} of the line were ready for <b>ballasting</b> and, as neither Dargan nor the B had any locomotives, a second-hand engine {{was obtained from the}} Ulster Railway to carry out the work.

25|$|M/T Unirea (Union) – {{broke up}} and sank at the {{beginning}} of the 1980s in Bulgarian waters of the Black Sea. Official reports claim that the accident was caused by a collision with a World War II mine.

25|$|Following World War I, the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics {{conducted}} studies {{concerning the}} possibility of submarine-borne observation and scouting aircraft. After surfacing, this plane should be rolled out and quickly assembled. It was planned to launch the seaplane by <b>ballasting</b> the submarine until the deck was awash.

25|$|The average {{human body}} with a relaxed lungful of air is close to neutral buoyancy. If the air is exhaled, most people will sink in fresh water, and with full lungs, most will float in seawater. The amount of weight {{required}} to provide neutral buoyancy to the naked diver is usually trivial, though {{there are some people}} who require several kilograms of weight to become neutral in seawater due to low average density and large size. This is usually the case with people with a large proportion of body fat. As the diver is nearly neutral, most <b>ballasting</b> is needed to compensate for the buoyancy of the diver's equipment.|$|E
25|$|Dagenett's job was {{to track}} down labor-intensive projects, such as railroad, dam {{construction}} and large-scale agricultural ventures, bargain with the employer to accept {{a certain number of}} Indian workmen, and then notify agency superintendents in the area as to the number of men wanted, the kind of work and the wages. Dagenett placed 600 men in his first season, and by summer 1906 he had placed 1,100 on the Salton Sea flood control project in Southern California; some 200 on the construction of the Saint Mary's Canal on the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana; more than 200 <b>ballasting</b> on the Santa Fe Railroad; 600 in the sugar-beet fields at Rocky Ford, Colorado; and about 3,000 in other activities, including sheepherding, lumbering, cantaloupe growing, road construction and irrigation projects. The Zuni Dam at Black Rock, New Mexico, was also built by Indian labor. A supervisor with each crew acted as liaison to the employer and was responsible for scheduling, helping the men with problems, and overseeing their health. Though the Indians had to pay for food, clothing and supplies out of their wages, it was reported that they still took home between 60 and 93 percent of the proceeds. Many Indians who showed aptitudes for special kinds of work received training and became skilled workers.|$|E

40|$|The human-mediated {{transfer}} of harmful organisms via shipping, especially via <b>ballast</b> water transport, has raised considerable attention {{especially in the}} last decade due to the negative associated impacts. <b>Ballast</b> water sampling is important to assess the compliance with <b>ballast</b> water management requirements (i. e. compliance monitoring).

40|$|The {{foundation}} of <b>ballasted</b> railway is usually {{consisted of a}} graded layer of granular media of <b>ballast</b> placed above naturally deposited subgrade. The <b>ballast</b> layer is responsible for limiting the vertical stress magnitudes applied to the weaker subgrade and also prevents the vertical and lateral train-induced sleeper movements. In recent years, the progressive use of faster and heavier trains has compromised the ability of <b>ballast</b> to resist such movements due to the increased magnitude of <b>ballast</b> breakage (degradation). Therefore, accurate determination of <b>ballast</b> breakage is important. The amount of <b>ballast</b> breakage can be estimated by comparing the gradation (particle size distribution) curves of fresh and degraded <b>ballast,</b> using a <b>ballast</b> breakage index. However, the Australian railway authorities currently rely on the visual inspection for estimating <b>ballast</b> breakage. Despite {{the fact that the}} visual inspection is convenient, as it does not require transport of <b>ballast</b> samples or testing, it is subjective and can lead to uneconomical maintenance cycles.
