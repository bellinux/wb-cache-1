40|$|Post spinal {{puncture}} headache (PSPH) {{is a well}} known complication of spinal anesthesia. It occurs after spinal anesthesia induction due to dural and arachnoid puncture and has {{a significant effect on}} the patient's postoperative well being. This manuscript is based on an observational study that runs on Babol University of Medical Sciences and review of literatures about current concepts about the incidence, risk factors and predisposing factors of post {{spinal puncture}} headache. The overall incidence of post-dural puncture headache after intentional dural puncture varies form 0. 1 - 36 %, while it is about 3. 1 % by atraumatic spinal needle 25 G Whitacre. 25 G Quincke needle with a medium <b>bevel</b> <b>cutting</b> is popular with widespread use and the incidence of PSPH is about 25 %, but its incidence obtained 17. 3 % by spinal needle 25 G Quincke in our observation.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a study where acoustic imaging technology was employed for problem identification and high damping interfaces (HDI) were {{implemented in the}} machine tool structure to improve performance of process machine interaction, in <b>bevel</b> gear <b>cutting,</b> in terms of resistance to instability. Chatter marks at the gear root and tool fracturing represent a serious and widespread problem in the studied process. The acoustic image approach showed good agreement with modal analysis and also allowed to identify the chatter frequency. Once identified the problem, the paper also {{presents a}} novel approach for improving resistance to cutting instability by implementing HDI in the structure. The HDI consists of a viscoelastic composite material and is used to damp out the stick blade motion relative to the clamp block by transformation of vibratory energy, into heat. The primary contributions of this paper are the introduction of acoustic imaging for identification of chatter in gear cutting and employment of HDI for performance improvement for rotating tools...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{spiral bevel}} gear NC {{manufacture}} principle and generating motion of the generating gear and the work gear, the NC generation of spiral <b>bevel</b> gear <b>cutting</b> is realized {{by means of the}} vector transformation. As sophisticated calculation of the transformation is hard to implement in each interpolation cycle of NC machining, the coordinated motion of NC coordinate axes is expressed as quintic parametric spline functions, which use the rotation angle of the work gear as the parameter. The constrained optimization method of three design variables is established to obtain contacting points of gear tooth surfaces, which are acquired by solving nonlinear equations sets traditionally. The condition of normal coincidence is simplified and the object function of the equal position vectors of mating gears is established. The contacting points of gear tooth surfaces can be used for tooth contact analysis. The parametric curve interpolator is combined with {{spiral bevel gear}} NC machining, and is applied to the self-developed spiral bevel gear NC milling machine to control the gear cutting. Experimental results show that the proposed method is feasible and effective in the control of NC machining for the spiral bevel gear...|$|R

40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{fluctuation}} of the <b>cutting</b> <b>bevel</b> angle in the plasma cutting process, a magnetic field parallel to the arc column is applied by a ring-shape permanent magnet installed in a plasma torch. The theoretical analysis is carried out on the relative interaction between the applied magnetic field and the arc in the torch, and it is shown that the diffusion time of the magnetic field to the arc is very small compared with the time scale of the arc fluctuation. This means that the magnetic field does not move {{in accordance with the}} arc fluctuation. The applied magnetic field generates a magnetic pressure of 8 Pa at the top surface of the cathode. The metal cutting test under the applied magnetic pressure shows the remarkable effect on the prevention of the arc fluctuation and the cut surface inclination...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop a laser cutting process model that can predict the relationship between the process input parameters and resultant surface roughness; kerf width characteristics. The research conduct is based on the Design of Experiment (DOE) analysis. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is used in {{this research}}, {{it is one of the}} most practical and most effective techniques to develop a process model. Even though RSM has been used for the optimisation of the laser process, published RSM modelling work on the application of laser cutting process on cutting material is lacking. This research investigates laser cutting stainless steel to be best the circumstances laser cutting using RSM process. The input parameters evaluated are gas pressure, power supply and cutting speed, the output responses being kerf width, surface roughness. The laser cutting process is one of the widely used techniques to cut thickness material for various applications such as fiber, steel wood fabrication. In the area of laser cutting material,it can be improved drastically with the application of hard cutting. The application of cut on stainless steel for various machining techniques, such as bevel linear and <b>bevel</b> non-linear <b>cutting,</b> requires different cut characteristics, these being highly dependent on the process parameters under which they were formed. To efficiently optimize and customize the kerf width and surface roughness characteristics, a machine laser cutting process model using RSM methodology was proposed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – In this study, an {{optimization}} model based on fuzzy logic {{was developed to}} determine the optimum value for cutting force of wheat stem. The input parameters of the fuzzy model were stem moisture, stem <b>cutting</b> height and <b>bevel</b> angle of <b>cutting</b> blade. In order to write the fuzzy rules for the stem cutting height, two low (0 - 15 cm), two middle (10 - 25 cm) and two high (20 - 35 cm) membership functions were considered. In the case of moisture content four membership functions, namely, suitable (0 - 20 %), semi suitable (10 - 30 %), high (20 - 40 %), and very high (35 - 50 %) and for the blade bevel angle three membership functions, including very low (0 - 10 º), low (10 - 20 º) and common (15 - 30 º) were assigned. Three membership functions were also assigned to the shearing strength, including good (0 - 3000), middle (2920 - 3574 kPa), and bad (3500 - 4300 kPa). The {{results showed that the}} fuzzy model used in this study had an acceptable prediction for determining the level of shear force to cut the stem. The developed fuzzy model had an accuracy of 91 %, 97 % and 100 %, respectively in bad, middle and good levels to predict the stem shearing strength...|$|R
50|$|Complex forms {{made on a}} {{wood lathe}} develop from {{surprisingly}} few types of cuts: parting, planing, bead, cove, and hollowing. Parting separates the wood from the holding device, or establishes depth cuts. Planing is done with a tool in which the <b>bevel</b> below the <b>cutting</b> edge supports wood fibers, just as in a typical wood planer. Beads are a convex shape relative to the cylinder, and coves are a concave shape. Hollowing techniques are a combination of drilling and scooping out materials. The woodturner is at liberty to choose {{from a variety of}} tools for all of these techniques, {{and the quality of the}} cuts improves with practice wielding the tool selected. Turners rely upon three points of contact making any type of cut: the tool presses down on the tool rest, and against the woodturner's body before contacting the surface of the wood, most often with a bevel edge riding the surface of the wood. The objective is to position the tool correctly so that the wood comes around to the cutting edge, generating a thin shaving without chipping or tearing out sections of the wood. Woodturners prefer to use very clean cuts to minimize the time spent with abrasives. When it is necessary to sand the piece, they do so on the lathe, using abrasives held by hand, in an inertial sander which revolves with the wood's own rotation, or with power tools—drills or right-angle drills. The lathe also becomes a useful holding device for carving, burning, texturing, coloring, and finishing the form.|$|R
