5|$|All Type IXA {{submarines}} {{were ordered}} by the Kriegsmarine between 29 July 1936 and 21 November 1936 as part of Plan Z and the overall German plan of re-armament {{in violation of the}} Treaty of Versailles. The design of the IXA submarines was derived from the German Type IA submarine. All contracts for the construction of the submarines were awarded to DeSchiMAG AG Weser, Bremen. The first U-boat to <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> down in the Bremen ship yards was U-37, whose keel was laid down on 15 March 1937. The last U-boat to <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> down was , whose construction began on 15 September 1937. By November 1939, all eight submarines had been fully constructed and commissioned into the Kriegsmarine.|$|E
5|$|It must be {{concluded}} that the Tower from Top to Bottom and the adjacent parts are such a heap of deformaties that no Judicious Architect will think it corrigible by any Expense that can <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> out upon new dressing it.|$|E
5|$|The August 1938 {{shipbuilding}} plan {{envisioned a}} total of 15 Project 23-class battleships, and this grandiose scheme was only slightly revised downward to 14 ships in the August 1939 plan. Eight of these were to <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> down before 1942 and the remaining six before 1947. However, only four were actually laid down before the outbreak of World War II forced the Soviets to reassess their ambitious plans. On 19 October 1940 an order was issued, signed by Stalin and Molotov, that no new battleships would <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> down in order to concentrate on smaller ships' building (and also, probably, because more resources were required for the Army), one ship is to be scrapped, and priority {{should be given to}} only one of the three remaining battleships.|$|E
25|$|Between 2001 and 2015 {{the company}} was {{reported}} as having multiple rounds of layoffs. In 2001, 350 employees, or 24% of total workforce, <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> off. Then in January 2003, 176 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> off and in June 2005, 89 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> off. In August 2006, 30 to 40 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> off. In 2007 two rounds of layoffs happened, first in March 2007, 175 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> off and then in December 2007, 18 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> off. In July 2015, roughly 200 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> off {{as part of a}} restructuring measure.|$|R
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of mines in Sri Lanka <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> on the Jaffna peninsula during the 1990s. Most of these <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> in dense well-structured belts by government forces, {{in the course of}} successive advances. However, mines <b>were</b> also <b>laid</b> on the peninsula by the LTTE; generally in 'nuisance minefields', where the mines <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> at random, and scattered over wide areas.|$|R
5|$|The bags <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> in courses, with {{barbed wire}} between each course to prevent slipping. Each course is tamped after it <b>is</b> <b>laid.</b>|$|R
5|$|The damp {{conditions}} meant {{required a}} large amount of sawdust to <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> down to help the players keep their grip. Along with the rain, the humid conditions assisted the Australian bowlers, who were able to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E
5|$|A {{bigger problem}} was the {{resistance}} of the Shipbuilding Commissariat which said {{it would be impossible to}} lay down any ships of new design until about 1950 and that only incremental changes could be made to the designs currently in production. The Navy saw no reason why new ships, reflecting wartime experience, could not <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> down beginning in 1948. To resolve the dispute a special commission was appointed, led by Lavrentiy Beria, which mostly sided with the Shipbuilding Commissariat in that most ships of the program would be improved versions of current designs. Four of the large cruisers were to begin construction, two each at Shipyard 402 in Molotovsk and Shipyard 444 at Nikolayev with another three planned to <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> down in 1953 and 1955. This compromise was approved on 27 November 1945 and detailed design work began in 1946 for designs equipped with both the 220mm and 305mm guns.|$|E

5|$|In Japan, the two battleships of the 1903-4 Programme {{were the}} first to <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> down as all-big-gun designs, with eight 12-inch guns. However, the design had armor which was {{considered}} too thin, demanding a substantial redesign. The financial pressures of the Russo-Japanese War and the short supply of 12-inch guns which had to be imported from Britain meant these ships were completed with a mixed 10- and 12-inch armament. The 1903-4 design also retained traditional triple-expansion steam engines.|$|E
5|$|On July 23 at Raw 1000, The Rock {{announced}} he would face the WWE Champion at the Royal Rumble.

He later saved Cena from an assault by Big Show, only to <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> out by CM Punk.|$|E
5|$|Rammed {{earth is}} {{generally}} made without much water, {{and so does}} not need much time to dry as the building rises. It is susceptible to moisture, so must <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> on a course that stops rising dampness, must be roofed or covered to keep out water from above, and may need protection through some sort of plaster, paint or sheathing.|$|E
25|$|The railway line <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> {{through the}} Square in 1875. The {{foundation}} stone {{for the original}} All Saints Church <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> by Louisa Snelson on 29 September 1875.|$|R

5|$|The Monarch-class {{ships were}} ordered in May 1892 with Budapest and Wien {{to be built}} at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} in Trieste. Both ships were laid down on 16 February 1893, the first ships in the class to <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> down. Budapest was launched on 27 April 1896 by Countess Marie Széchényí-Andrássy, wife of the Governor of Fiume, and commissioned on 12 May 1898.|$|E
5|$|The Pipeline Authorization Act {{required}} the pipeline {{to be able}} to withstand the maximum earthquake ever recorded in the area it was built. When crossing the Denali Fault, Teflon-coated sliders were designed to allow the pipeline to move side-to-side in an earthquake. To protect against forward-and-backward shocks and to allow for thermal expansion, the pipeline wasn't designed as a straight line. Instead, it was intended to <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> in an S-shape, and the bends would allow for expansion and movement without breaking.|$|E
5|$|The Tower Athletic Grounds was a {{multi-purpose}} {{stadium and}} ground that could <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> out for athletics field events. The field was encircled by an athletics track {{surrounded by a}} banked cycle track, which hosted the World Cycling championships in July 1922. It was the biggest sporting and motorcycling track in the North of England. In 1933, the athletics track was replaced for use every Saturday by motorcycle speedway racing.|$|E
50|$|Adults pair up {{when they}} are breeding. The eggs <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> in the substrate. Once the eggs <b>are</b> <b>laid,</b> the male guards and aerates the eggs until they hatch.|$|R
50|$|Typically 50-100 <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> over 3 days, {{the adult}} not {{surviving}} {{to see them}} hatch. They <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> in fairly moist places, e.g. stem of grass or under moss.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{public school}} {{teachers}} in New York who <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> off <b>are</b> placed on a Preferred Eligible List for employment in the school district where they <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> off for seven years from the date of layoff.

5|$|The {{bodies of}} the two Neville {{brothers}} were brought back to London. They did not suffer the customary fate accorded to traitors—quartering and display at the city gates. Edward exhibited the brothers' naked corpses in St. Paul's Cathedral for three days to quell any rumours that they had survived, before allowing them to <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> {{to rest in the}} family vault at Bisham Abbey.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of Bartholdi's statue was to <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> inside Fort Wood, a disused army base on Bedloe's Island constructed between 1807 and 1811. Since 1823, it had rarely been used, though during the Civil War, it {{had served as}} a recruiting station. The fortifications of the structure were in the shape of an eleven-point star. The statue's foundation and pedestal were aligned so that it would face southeast, greeting ships entering the harbor from the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{consensus is}} that responsibility or guilt for the war was not attached to the article. Rather, the clause was a prerequisite to allow a legal basis to <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> out for the reparation payments that were to be made. Historians have also highlighted the unintended damage created by the clause, which caused anger and resentment amongst the German population.|$|E
50|$|Southwestern Indiana has {{clusters}} of separate towns of varying sizes and layouts. Vincennes <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> {{out in the}} French quadrangular, while Jasper and Princeton <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> out in a standard grid.

50|$|The town <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> out by Maxwell Woodhull on September 30, 1857. An {{addition}} <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> out in 1867, {{and another}} in 1870. That same year, the town was incorporated.|$|R
5000|$|The Rajputana-Malwa Railway {{extended}} the [...] wide metre gauge Delhi-Rewari line to Bathinda in 1884. The metre gauge Hisar-Sadulpur link <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> in 1911. The Bhiwani-Rohtak link <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> in 1979.|$|R
5|$|The line winds {{south from}} Llanhilleth for miles (4.5km), past {{the village of}} Crumlin, to the next station at Newbridge, at {{the eastern end of}} Newbridge town centre. Newbridge station {{provides}} Park and Ride car park and bus interchange facilities. To enable the additional service between Ebbw Vale and Newport to begin dual track would need to <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> and second platforms constructed at Llanhilleth and Newbridge stations, allowing trains to pass each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} {{supposed}} to find five Tarot cards in the game in order to solve a crucial puzzle. Each card triggers a cut-scene.

5|$|The {{ships were}} {{originally}} intended to <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> down 1 September 1939, but they were delayed until November to allow improvements to the shipyards to be completed. A total of sixteen ships were planned in the August 1939 building program, but this was scaled back to four in July 1940 and two in October 1940 {{when it became clear}} just how unprepared the Soviets were for any large-scale naval construction program. Work on these ships ceased shortly after the German invasion.|$|E
