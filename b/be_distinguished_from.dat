5|$|Leccinellum albellum {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to L.holopus, but grows in association with oak and has a more southerly distribution. L.scabrum is a widely distributed lookalike that can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> L.holopus by its larger size and generally darker colors.|$|E
5|$|The Dorrigo waratah can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> {{other members}} of the genus Alloxylon by its pinnate adult leaves. This feature serves to {{differentiate}} it as other species in the genus have simple adult leaves. The other species have inflorescences with fewer flowers (50 maximum), and have yellow pollen.|$|E

50|$|Pseudocalotes was disassociated {{from the}} genus Calotes by Moody (1980). Pseudocalotes <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> Calotes in having weak limbs, {{as may be}} noted {{in one of the}} species named brevipes. It <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> the C. versicolor group in having mixed {{orientation}} of dorsal scales, and lacking spines on the head. It <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> Bronchocela in lacking a cheek skin fold, and in having short weak limbs. Pseudocalotes species do not have any enlarged compressed set of scales behind the orbit.|$|R

5|$|The nelicourvi weaver can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> {{the related}} sakalava weaver, which has {{streaked}} plumage. The somewhat related forest fody and Madagascar fody mostly have streaked upperparts and scarlet {{as the most}} obvious colour.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow loris has a diploid {{chromosome}} number of 2n=50. Although the banding patterns on the chromosomes of all slow lorises are similar, this species may <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> the Bengal slow loris (N.bengalensis) by distinct differences in the number and location of nucleolus organizer regions.|$|E
5|$|The site should <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> Luscombe in {{the parish}} of Rattery in Devon, about 16 miles to the south-west, {{the seat of the}} Luscombe family from before the 16th century to shortly before 1810.|$|E
5000|$|A second aorist passive <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> a first aorist passive only by {{the absence}} of [...] A few verbs have passive aorists in both forms, usually with no {{distinction}} in meaning; but [...] "I appeared" [...] <b>is</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> [...] "I <b>was</b> shown".|$|R

5|$|With its short stipe {{and sticky}} cap, S.quiescens {{is similar to}} S.brevipes. It may <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> the latter species {{by the color of}} the young (light-brown) cap, the glandular dots at the top of stipes in mature specimens, and the {{yellowish}} color {{at the top of the}} stipe.|$|E
5|$|A.coccinea {{closely resembles}} A.arachnoidea, but may <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> the latter by its bright red arms, and its larger spores (4–5 by 2.5–3μm in A.coccinea {{compared}} with 2.5–3.5 by 1.5μm in A.arachnoidea). A.arachnoidea is known from Asia and West Africa. A.rubra {{is a relatively}} common pantropical species, and differs from A.coccinea in its reddish receptacle (compared with pink to cream-colored in A.coccinea) and bifurcating arms that are typically multichambered.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum {{closely resembles}} the other {{species in the}} A.pedatum complex (A.pedatum and A.aleuticum), and {{distinguishing}} the three {{in the field is}} difficult. Paris and Windham, in their study of the complex, noted that while each species, collectively, can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> the others, no single morphological character was absolutely distinctive among species. Sterile triploid hybrids between A.viridimontanum and the other two species may occur, further complicating field identification.|$|E

5|$|Among myriapods, millipedes have {{traditionally}} been considered most {{closely related to the}} tiny pauropods, although some molecular studies challenge this relationship. Millipedes can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> the somewhat similar but only distantly related centipedes (class Chilopoda), which move rapidly, are carnivorous, and have only a single pair of legs on each body segment. The scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology, and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist.|$|E
5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity {{depend on the}} ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species can}} <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> most other {{swallows}} in their breeding or wintering ranges by the streaking on the underparts. Although the lesser striped swallow has white underparts with dark streaking, it is larger, has a deeply forked tail {{and a very}} different plumage, with dark blue upperparts, a red rump and a chestnut head.|$|E

5|$|FH {{needs to}} <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> {{familial}} combined hyperlipidemia and polygenic hypercholesterolemia. Lipid levels {{and the presence}} of xanthomata can confirm the diagnosis. Sitosterolemia and cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis are two rare conditions that can also present with premature atherosclerosis and xanthomas. The latter condition can also involve neurological or psychiatric manifestations, cataracts, diarrhea and skeletal abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|For giant stars, the {{atmospheric}} microturbulence {{can result in}} line broadening that is much larger than effects of rotational, effectively drowning out the signal. However, an alternate approach can be employed that makes use of gravitational microlensing events. These occur when a massive object passes {{in front of the}} more distant star and functions like a lens, briefly magnifying the image. The more detailed information gathered by this means allows the effects of microturbulence to <b>be</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> rotation.|$|E
