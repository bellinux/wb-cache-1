40|$|<b>Bluefish,</b> Pomatomus saltatrix, is a migratory {{pelagic species}} {{found in most}} {{temperate}} and tropical marine waters throughout the world. Along the U. S. Atlantic Coast, <b>bluefish</b> commonly occur in estuarine and continental shelf waters. <b>Bluefish</b> are a schooling species that migrate in response to seasonal changes, moving north and inshore during the spring and south and offshore in the late autumn. The Atlantic <b>bluefish</b> fishery is believed to exploit a single stock or population of fish. <b>Bluefish</b> {{is one of the}} most sought after species in the recreational fisheries along the Atlantic Coast. In 2004, recreational anglers along the Atlantic Coast harvested over 6. 9 thousand metric tons (mt) of <b>bluefish,</b> second only to striped bass (11. 7 thousand mt harvested). Recreational catch of <b>bluefish</b> has averaged over 19 thousand mt since 1982. Landings from the commercial <b>bluefish</b> fishery have been consistently lower than the recreational catch. Regional variations in commercial fishing activity are linked to the seasonal migration of <b>bluefish.</b> <b>Bluefish</b> are most abundant in the North and Mid-Atlantic from late spring to early fall, when the majority of commercial fishing activity for <b>bluefish</b> in these areas occurs. In the late fall and winter, <b>bluefish</b> move southward and landings peak in the South Atlantic region. Annually, the majority of commercial landings are taken in the Mid- and South Atlantic regions where approximately 87 % of the coastwide total landings have occurred since 1950...|$|R

40|$|Spatial {{gradients}} of {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides {{were examined in}} the young-of-the-year (YOY) <b>bluefish</b> (Pomatomus saltatrix) {{in the vicinity of}} a PCB Superfund Site in New Bedford Harbor, Massachusetts, and in the adjacent waters. PCB concentrations in <b>bluefish</b> varied between different locations, and also among fish from a given location. A generally decreasing gradient in PCB concentrations was evident as the <b>bluefish</b> were collected away from the Superfund Site. The average sum of PCB concentrations were highest for <b>bluefish</b> collected in the Upper Harbor between Interstate- 195 Bridge and Coggeshall Street Bridge (Upper Harbor), followed by <b>bluefish</b> in Lower Harbor from north of Popes Island Bridge (Lower Harbor), and <b>bluefish</b> from Outer Harbor south of Hurricane Barrier (Outer Harbor). The levels of PCBs in <b>bluefish</b> from Clarks Cove and PCBs in <b>bluefish</b> from Buzzards Bay were similar and lowest among all <b>bluefish</b> specimens analyzed in the present study. Pesticide concentrations were about one order of magnitude or lower than the PCB concentrations, and the gradient of pesticide concentrations generally followed the gradient of PCB concentrations. Some of the commonly detected pesticides in the order of decreasing concentrations included DDTs and metabolites, heptachlor epoxide, endosulfan sulfate, and α-chlordane. Distribution of PCBs and organochlorine pesticides were examined in the tissues of YOY <b>bluefish</b> from Clarks Cove. PCBs and lipids in the brain samples of YOY <b>bluefish</b> were generally numerically greater than PCBs in the liver samples, but these differences were not statistically significant. PCBs and lipids in hypaxial muscle samples were numerically greater than PCBs in epaxial muscle samples, although these two groups of tissues were not statistically different. Despite the higher susceptibility of lighter PCB homologs to geophysical and biogeochemical weathering processes, the relative dominance of lighter homologs in the Upper Harbor and Lower Harbor samples suggested ongoing or recent sources of these lighter PCBs, particularly Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1016 in this area. The presence of heavier homologs in the Upper Harbor and Lower Harbor <b>bluefish</b> samples could be attributed to Aroclor 1252 and Aroclor 1254 that were being used in relatively smaller quantities in the manufacture of electrical components in addition to Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1016. The concentration of heavier PCB homologs appears to increase in YOY <b>bluefish</b> the further away from the PCB Superfund Site in the Acushnet Estuary the samples were collected. Principal component analyses of PCB 153 normalized concentrations of the individual PCB congeners resulted in two general groupings; a relatively tight group comprised of YOY <b>bluefish</b> from Upper Harbor, Lower Harbor, and Outer Harbor, and a rather loose and more dispersed group comprised of Buzzards Bay <b>bluefish</b> and the tissue samples of <b>bluefish</b> from Clarks Cove. Principal component analyses of major pesticides suggested close groupings of <b>bluefish</b> from Clarks Cove and <b>bluefish</b> from Buzzards Bay. Pesticides in <b>bluefish</b> from Upper Harbor, Lower Harbor, and Outer Harbor formed a loose group, with some <b>bluefish</b> from these locations populating close to Clarks Cove and Buzzards Bay <b>bluefish.</b> Although PCBs have been implicated in various behavioral and health effects in the experimental and field studies, the deleterious effects of chronic exposure to high concentrations of PCBs and the potential for recruitment of New Bedford Harbor YOY <b>bluefish</b> population to the adult stock remains obscure. Adaptive or evolutionary resistance to contaminants have been documented in resident species in some highly contaminated estuaries, however similar responses have not been investigated in the migratory species like <b>bluefish.</b> The {{results of the present study}} provide a reference baseline for YOY <b>bluefish</b> for ‘‘before-and-after’’ comparative studies and other toxicological studies for the New Bedford Harbor Superfund Site that is currently being remediated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —Previous {{field studies}} of <b>bluefish</b> Pomatomus saltatrix have {{documented}} variation in young-of-the-year (age- 0) growth rates among years and between spring- and summer-spawned cohorts. However, the potential factors responsible for generating variable growth in age- 0 <b>bluefish</b> {{have not been}} investigated. We constructed an individual-based model that combined size-dependent <b>bluefish</b> foraging with a bioenergetics model to quantify the potential effects of variable prey fish dynamics on first-summer growth of juvenile <b>bluefish.</b> We used long-term monitoring data to define baseline conditions and calibrate the model. We then performed three simulation experiments designed to assess the effects of initial density and arrival timing of prey species and <b>bluefish</b> cohorts on <b>bluefish</b> length distributions on October 1. Simulation experiments indicated that spring-spawned <b>bluefish</b> were robust to fluctuations in prey dynamics because of a spawning strategy that ensures temporal overlap with a diversity of prey fish species. In contrast, summer-spawned <b>bluefish</b> were sensitive to variation in prey fish dynamics because of their dependence on a single prey species. Model results also revealed {{the potential for the}} time of arrival and the initial density of the spring-spawned cohort to affect the growth of the summer-spawned cohort. Our findings demonstrate that population-level interactions between <b>bluefish</b> and their prey can be complex and have a considerable influence on the early growth rates of the summer-spawned cohort...|$|R

40|$|Coastal sea-cage farms {{aggregate}} large {{concentrations of}} pelagic and demersal fish. The {{large numbers of}} cultured fish and aggregated wild fish often attract a range of marine mammal predators which may break into cages and attack the cultured fish. To date, predation by a finfish species within sea-cages has not been documented. In the Mediterranean Sea, the <b>bluefish</b> Pomatomus saltatrix (L.) aggregates around sea-cage farms and enters into cages to predate on the cultured fish. We obtained information {{about the effects of}} <b>bluefish</b> predation on aquaculture production through a questionnaire that was completed by fish farmers in Spain, Italy, Malta, Turkey, Greece and Cyprus. In addition, we identified the abundance, size and stomach contents of <b>bluefish</b> aggregated around three fish farms on the coast of Spain through visual counts, and from captured <b>bluefish</b> both inside and outside of the sea-cages. <b>Bluefish</b> occurred around fish farms in Spain, Italy, Malta and Turkey. Farmers in SE Spain reported its presence only inside seabream (Sparus aurata) cages, while in Turkey <b>bluefish</b> were reported from inside seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and seabream cages. Greatest aggregated biomass of <b>bluefish</b> reached 1049 and 3191 kg at the Altea and Guardamar farms, respectively, with abundance peaking at 4500 individuals at both farms. Size structures differed markedly between farms, with smaller individuals aggregating at Altea. Stomach content analysis revealed that <b>bluefish</b> on the outside of sea-cages consumed pelagic species such as Sardinella aurita and Trachurus mediterraneus, while they predated on seabream once they incurred into cages, often consuming only the tails of many fish. The interaction of <b>bluefish</b> with sea-cage aquaculture is, at present, a problem of local concern restricted to some areas of the Mediterranean Sea, but its widespread distribution suggests this piscivore may be a problematic predator in other regions...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bluefish,</b> Pomatomus saltatrix (Linnaeus, 1766), is {{commonly}} observed close to Mediterranean open-sea fish farms.

40|$|Recruitment in fishes, {{defined as}} the {{survival}} of a cohort through {{the first year of}} life, can be highly variable and affected by small changes in biological and physical factors. Much of the historical focus into the sources of recruitment variability has concentrated on the larval stage, but recent attention has shifted to the relatively longer juvenile period. Spawning behavior that results in the production of multiple cohorts over time and space within a year-class may dampen recruitment variability by decreasing natural mortality risk. The <b>bluefish</b> (Pomatomus saltatrix) is a migratory marine species that produces multiple cohorts of offspring during annual spawning migrations. Juvenile <b>bluefish</b> are among the fastest growing fish in the ocean. Consequently, <b>bluefish</b> {{is one of the few}} species that both mature and enter the fishery shortly after its first birthday, so recruitment success may be particularly critical in determining year-class strength. The following dissertation explores the factors that influence recruitment potential of <b>bluefish.</b> The first chapter provides a brief history of the study of recruitment in fisheries science and an introduction to <b>bluefish</b> life history. Chapter two investigates the interaction between the juvenile <b>bluefish</b> cohorts in the Hudson River estuary prior to the autumn migration.
