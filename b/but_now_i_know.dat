500|$|Almost a {{year after}} filming her final scenes, Lister {{explained}} that she felt her exit was the right choice, saying: [...] "It felt {{it was time to}} go so I just ran with my instincts. Looking back, I was nervous <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> I've done the right thing. I love theatre work. It gives me such a buzz. [...] was the break I'd been praying for. I threw myself into the part and enjoyed every minute of it. I had three superb years and it was brilliant." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album cover}} was photographed by Björk's former boyfriend, the French {{director}} Stéphane Sednaoui. It shows the singer {{standing in a}} London street, her pale skin and dark hair contrasting with the vivid colours of the Japanese-inspired signs behind her. An earlier shoot by Jean-Baptiste Mondino was scrapped; it would later appear in a 1995 article for The Face, in which Björk explained: [...] "It cost £24,000. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what I want. OK, I admit it, [...] I'm a pop star"! In the original cover picture, Björk was surrounded by silver balls, but she scrapped the cover in favour of something [...] "more poppy". Designer Paul White of Me Company—who had been a frequent collaborator since The Sugarcubes—"surrounded her with giant postcards to represent communication with friends and family". Me Company designed the artwork, while Martin Gardiner modelled the lotus flower used in the album's booklet and packaging. The jacket Björk wears, shown on the cover, was inspired by Royal Mail airmail envelopes, referencing the album's title. It was specially crafted from envelope paper called Tyvek by designer Hussein Chalayan. Björk {{was a friend of}} Chalayan and an admirer of his designs, modelling for him in September 1995. The jacket is displayed under glass at Hard Rock Reykjavík, and was part of a 2015 MoMA retrospective on the singer, titled Björk. Vice has identified the airmail jacket look as one the [...] "ultimate fashion moments" [...] of Björk's career.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, a Midrash {{interpreted}} [...] where Moses told Aaron, [...] "This is {{what the}} Lord meant when He said: ‘Through those near to Me I show Myself holy, and gain glory before all the people.'" [...] The Midrash taught that God told this to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, when in [...] God said, [...] "there I will meet with the children of Israel; and the Tabernacle shall be sanctified by My glory." [...] And {{after the death of}} Nadab and Abihu, Moses said to Aaron, [...] "At the time that God told me, I thought that either you or I would be stricken, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that they [...] are greater than you or me." ...|$|E
60|$|On this {{occasion}} I had no misgivings. On the former visit I {{had for a}} moment been overwhelmed at the unexpected sight {{of the body of}} the woman I thought <b>I</b> loved--I <b>knew</b> it now--lying in her tomb. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> all, and it was to see this woman, though in her tomb, that I came.|$|R
60|$|That was enough! From {{that moment}} I have never again felt {{suspicion}} of Raja, as I immediately named him. Somehow {{all sense of}} loneliness vanished, too--I had a dog! I had never guessed precisely {{what it was that}} was lacking to life in Pellucidar, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> it was the total absence of domestic animals.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; for her sake. I {{would have}} {{shielded}} him once---if <b>I</b> could. <b>But</b> not <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> at last, {{that there is}} no single good thing left in him." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how few and small, [...] The {{things we}} crave need be-- [...] Toys and the {{universe}} and you-- [...] A little friend to tea.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let's don't wait," [...] {{returned}} Dorothy. [...] "I've {{heard of}} the Rigmaroles, and wondered what they were like; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> and I'm ready to move on." ...|$|E
6000|$|She said: [...] "I can't {{tell whether}} I've been asleep or not, sometimes; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> I have been; and I feel so rested. Where {{are we going}} to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose so. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it is {{all right}} I shall not mind it. I wonder if I couldn't send my father the good news by telegraph?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, yes. It was iniquitous. They {{corrupted}} him thoroughly, {{the poor}} old boy. Oh! why wouldn't {{he let me}} go back to him? <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>know</b> how to grapple with this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh oft have I {{heard of}} the Micklegard, [...] What I held for chapmen's lies; <b>But</b> <b>now</b> do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> of the Micklegard, [...] By the sight of mine own eyes.|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that it {{was more}} [...] Than idle fancy. O, my sweet, [...] I did not think such little feet [...] Could make a buried heart so sore! ...|$|E
60|$|MINNIE. And I took to religion. You {{meant to}} be kind, Mrs. Pindar, and I thank you. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> why Jamesy took to drink--it was {{for the same reason}} I took to religion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very true. Valentin annoyed {{me at the}} time, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you better, I {{may tell}} you he was right. If you come often, you will see!" [...] and Madame de Cintre turned away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thus that Spirit {{spoke to}} me, Councillors, {{though at the}} time <b>I</b> did not <b>know</b> whether the vision {{were more than a}} happy dream. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> do <b>know</b> that it was no dream, but the truth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ten days since, child, I {{would have}} sworn to it; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> hardly <b>know</b> what to believe. May I take {{the liberty of}} asking, Arrowhead, why you fancy that smoke, now, a pale-face's smoke, and not a red-skin's?" ...|$|R
6000|$|But my reward came at last. It was {{the print}} of the thumb of the forty-third man of Company C whom I had experimented on--Private Franz Adler. An hour before, <b>I</b> did not <b>know</b> the murderer's name, or voice, or figure, or face, or nationality; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> all these things! I {{believed}} I might feel sure; the Frenchman's repeated demonstrations being so good a warranty. Still, {{there was a way}} to MAKE sure. I had an impression of Kruger's left thumb. In the morning I took him aside when he was off duty; and when we were out of sight and hearing of witnesses, I said, impressively-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She rather irritated {{me at the}} time," [...] {{continued}} my mother. [...] "I {{thought it}} one of those commonplaces with which we console ourselves for other people's misfortunes. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> she spoke the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{this the}} Sheriff turned to Little John and said bitterly, [...] "Long ago I thought I remembered thy face, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> thee. Woe betide thee, Little John, for thou hast betrayed me this day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is, indeed, good news," [...] said Shaggy. [...] "I {{suspected}} {{that my brother}} was the prisoner of Ruggedo; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it. Tell us, Tik-Tok, how shall {{we get to the}} Nome King's underground cavern?" ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{studying}} vocal {{performance and}} theater {{studies at the}} University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Guarini later moved to New York City where he attended the School for Film and Television. He worked in New York nightclubs, and auditioned for New York Theatre before successfully auditioning for American Idol in April 2002. Shortly after being chosen for American Idol, he was offered {{a role in the}} Broadway production of The Lion King. Guarini wrote about his decision between the two offers in his exclusive 2008 blog for the television site, Fancast, stating, [...] "I had attended master classes… I learned Zulu and Sotho phrases, as well as the music from the show. It was a dream almost come true at the time. <b>But,</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was onto something, and I wasn’t letting go. I politely declined the offer of a role...". He was also considering a contract offer from an independent record label, but the show's rules prohibited participants from having existing record contracts.|$|R
60|$|There was Kari, it is true, who <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> {{loved me}} in his fashion, but between him and me {{there was a great}} gulf fixed, not only of race and faith, <b>but</b> of {{something}} <b>now</b> which <b>I</b> did not wholly understand. In London he had been my servant and his ends were my ends; on our wandering he had been my companion in great adventures. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that other interests and desires had taken a hold of him, and that he trod a road of which I could not see the goal; and no longer thought much of me save when what I did or desired to do came between him and that goal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{he is too}} young, though I don't see how {{it could}} be helped. Papa always {{intended}} it, because of the living; and Herbert never wished anything else. I thought he really desired it, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> whether he did not only take it as a matter of course." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it's green," [...] moaned Anne. [...] "I {{thought nothing}} could {{be as bad as}} red hair. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it's ten times worse to have green hair. Oh, Marilla, you little know how utterly wretched I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the meaning}} of the moonlight, and the essence of the poetry," [...] {{continued}} the impassioned girl. [...] "I did not know then why I liked such things, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> It was because I longed to be loved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I was; {{and then}} I {{followed}} the chase by mere nature and inclination. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> I {{have a right}} to follow it, because it gives me endurance, promptness, courage, self-control, as well as health and cheerfulness: and therefore--Ah! a fresh ostrich-track!' ...|$|E
50|$|Asked if I {{would do}} it all again, I used to give an unequivocal reply that of course <b>I</b> would. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> if <b>I</b> would.

6000|$|... "When I got {{the letter}} I thought the same, and I also {{thought we might}} ask Songbird and Minnie--Dora and Nellie could {{chaperon}} her, you <b>know.</b> <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> what we'll do about them. Most likely Songbird wouldn't feel like going if that money wasn't recovered, and more than likely Mr. Sanderson wouldn't let Minnie go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They grew so {{fast that}} by the time the cold weather came, they were as big as their father and mother," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Quack. [...] "And they were smart, too. They had learned {{how to take care of}} themselves just as well as I could. I certainly was proud of that family. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> where one of them is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I {{could not}} think where all the water came from, to keep the brook running so fast all the time. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that some {{of it has been}} coming all the time from this bog. Does it all come from bogs?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not wish it, Margery!" [...] exclaimed the bee-hunter, in {{the manner}} of a {{disappointed}} man. [...] "I had supposed you would have wished my company. <b>But,</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the contrary, I shall not much care how soon I go, or into whose hands I fall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By George!" [...] I yelled, greatly excited. [...] "I {{heard that}} lion breathing. Don chased him up there. I heard hard, {{wheezing}} breaths somewhere behind me, {{but in the}} excitement I didn't {{pay any attention to}} them. I thought it was Jones panting, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what it meant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had hoped," [...] said Thuvia, [...] "that {{we might}} find an asylum with these fair-skinned people. Notwithstanding their valour upon the field of battle, they did not strike me as a ferocious or warlike people. I had been about {{to suggest that we}} seek {{entrance}} to the city, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> scarce <b>know</b> if <b>I</b> care to venture among people whose dead vanish into thin air." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{say there}} is no Master <b>now.</b> <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> carried the bodies into the sea, O Walker in the Sea! the bodies of those you slew. I am your slave, Master." ...|$|R
6000|$|The teacher's {{pretty face}} was {{strained}} and white, and her wide-set eyes were painful to see. She set her slim hands together. [...] "Oh, I can't answer you <b>now,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you are wrong--wickedly wrong!" ...|$|R
