Studies with a model Mycobacterium (Mycobacterium smegmatis) revealed that by removing salts and cryoprotectant (e. g., glycerol) from bacterial suspensions, the significant osmotic pressures that are normally produced on bacterial membranes through droplet drying can be reduced sufficiently to minimize loss of viability on drying by up to 2 orders of magnitude. By placing the bacteria in a matrix of leucine, high-yield, free-flowing, “vial-fillable” powders of bacteria (including M. smegmatis and M. bovis BCG) can be produced. These powders show relatively minor losses of activity after maintenance at 4 °C and 25 °C up to and beyond 4 months.

The work {{was carried out}} on the academic basis of pediatric infectious departments of Donetsk region and Donetsk regional laboratory center of State sanitary and epidemiological service of Ukraine. Comparative analysis of complications of BCG vaccinations {{in the form of}} regional lymphadenitis for 3 years is carried out. Evaluation of immune status was based on a comprehensive study of indicators of general reactive potential of the organism by studying the qualitative-quantitative characteristics of hemogram. Results. In Donetsk region for 3 years 19, 078 children were vaccinated with <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> (Denmark) and 14, 328 — with <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> (Russia), of whom 210 children developed complications: 143 (0. 74 %) children were vaccinated with <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> (Denmark) and 67 (0. 46 %) — with Russian <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Clinical forms of complications to some extent were determined {{by the nature of the}} <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine.</b> When using the <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> (Denmark), infiltrative forms were 2. 2 times more common among the complications in the form of lymphadenitis of various localization, and the presence of a fistula (5. 7 %) were detected compared with children vaccinated with <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> (Russia). In addition, very rare complications were 3 times more frequent — 10 versus 3. 3 %. They are: plague is the middle third of the left shoulder; sternoclavicular combination of BCG assoc., dest. + MBT(–), newly diagnosed tuberculosis (NDT), secondary pulmonary tuberculosis; tuberculous osteitis of the right hip; tuberculous osteitis of the lower third of the right hip; tuberculous osteitis of the 4 / 3 of the right femur; tuberculous osteitis of the left knee joint with <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> (Denmark). When <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> (Russia) was used, we detected only NDT, tuberculous osteitis and NDT, onitis, D+, MBT(+). Features of general reactive potential of the organism at BCG vaccination are determined by more significant degree of inflammatory activity in young children, as well as by a decrease in the body’s ability to respond to antigenic stimulus and a pronounced risk of breaking a barrier to infection — the possibility of generalization of infection in infants on the background of normal allergic disposition of the body. Conclusions. When using <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> of Russian production, there is far less significant overload of blood flow by products of intoxication and inflammation, more pronounced body’s ability to respond to antigenic stimulus generalization and no risk of infection, especially in infants, compared with Danish <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine.</b> For vaccination of infants against tuberculosis, it is advisable to use more refined, with high immunogenicity and less reactogenic <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> of Russian production.

The World Health Organization (WHO) established the Expanded Program on Immunization in 1974 {{to ensure that all}} children have access to routinely recommended <b>vaccines</b> including <b>BCG.</b> Each year 120 million doses of <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> are administered worldwide.

40|$|Rationale: Approximately 100 {{million doses}} of bacille Calmette-Guérin (<b>BCG)</b> <b>vaccine</b> are given {{each year to}} protect against {{tuberculosis}} (TB). More than 20 genetically distinct <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> strains are in use worldwide. Previous studies suggest that <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> strain influences the immune response and protection against TB. Current data on which <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> strain induces the optimal immune response in humans are insufficient. Objectives: To compare the immune response to three different <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> strains given to infants at birth. Methods: Newborn infants in a tertiary women's hospital were immunized at birth with one of three <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> strains. A stratified randomization according to the mother's region of birth was used. Measurements and main results: The presence of mycobacterial-specific polyfunctional CD 4 T cells measured by flow cytometry 10 weeks after immunization. Of the 209 infants immunized, data from 164 infants {{were included in the}} final analysis (BCG-Denmark, n = 54; BCG-Japan, n = 54; BCG-Russia, n = 57). The proportion of polyfunctional CD 4 T cells was significantly higher in infants immunized with BCG-Denmark (0. 013 %) or BCG-Japan (0. 016 %) than with BCG-Russia (0. 007 %) (P = 0. 018 and P = 0. 003, respectively). Infants immunized with BCG-Japan had higher concentrations of secreted Th 1 cytokines; infants immunized with BCG-Denmark had higher proportions of CD 107 -expressing cytotoxic CD 4 T cells. Conclusions: There are significant differences in the immune response induced by different <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> strains in newborn infants. Immunization with BCG-Denmark or BCG-Japan induced higher frequencies of mycobacterial-specific polyfunctional and cytotoxic T cells and higher concentrations of Th 1 cytokines.

Other relevant topics such as BCG and HIV/AIDS, use of tuberculin skin test, issues related to vaccine scars and to the development of new vaccines were also reviewed. Summary of the findings: <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> has been used since 1921. However, the data concerning its use are variable and inconsistent. The protective efficacy of the first dose of <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> against miliary tuberculosis or tuberculous meningitis is remarkably important.

Results: Out of total number of 35 patients in case group, 3 (8. 6 %) patients had severe complication, also they diagnosed as BCG-osis; 32 (91. 42 %) cases had moderate symptoms‎. In the control group 25 (71. 4 %) patients had mild complications and 10 (28. 57 %) patients had no complications. The mean of IL- 23 level in the two groups had significant difference (P= 0. 027).

40|$|Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative {{agent of}} tuberculosis, {{is the most}} lethal single {{infectious}} agent afflicting man today causing 2 million deaths per year. The World Health Organization recommends a vaccine as the best option to prevent this disease. The current <b>vaccine,</b> <b>BCG,</b> has a variable efficacy and does not protect adults. It is known that <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> becomes sequestered in special phagosome compartments of macrophages that do not fuse with lysosomes. Since lysosome fusion is necessary for peptide production and T cell priming leading to protective TH 1 immunity, we hypothesized that vaccine efficacy is reduced and occurs perhaps due to non-lysosome dependent mechanisms. We therefore proposed an in depth analysis of phagosome environment, and its proteome to unravel mechanisms of antigen processing and presentation. We initially discovered that three mechanisms of pH regulation including vacuolar proton ATPase, phagocyte oxidase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) secretion from <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> affect antigen processing within phagosomes. These studies led to the discovery that a mutant of <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> which lacked SOD was a better vaccine. Subsequently, the proteomic analysis of vaccine phagosomes led {{to the discovery of}} novel protease (γ-secretase) enriched on <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> phagosomes. We then demonstrated that these proteases generated a peptide from the <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> which was presented through the MHC-II pathway to T cells and induced a TH 1 response. The specificity of antigen production from γ-secretase was confirmed through siRNA knockdown of the components of the protease namely, nicastrin, presenilin and APH, which led to a decrease in antigen presentation. We therefore conclude that, even though BCG phagosomes are sequestered and do not fuse with lysosomes to generate peptide antigens, there are complex and novel in situ mechanisms within phagosomes that are capable of generating an immune response. We conclude that TH 1 immunity to <b>BCG</b> <b>vaccine</b> arises mostly due to non-lysosome dependent immune mechanisms of macrophages and dendritic cells...|$|R
