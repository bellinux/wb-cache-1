5|$|The bronze nails, {{with their}} flat tops and raised edges which prevent coins from {{tumbling}} onto the pavement, were made as convenient tables at which merchants could {{carry out their}} business. The oldest pillar is undated, <b>but</b> <b>experts</b> say it is late Elizabethan. The second oldest was given by Bristol merchant Robert Kitchen, who died in 1594. The two remaining nails are dated 1625 and 1631.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, two {{students}} {{claimed to have}} found a large tooth embedded in the body of a deer on the loch shore. They publicised the find, setting up a website, <b>but</b> <b>expert</b> analysis soon revealed that the [...] "tooth" [...] was the antler of a muntjac. The tooth was a publicity stunt to promote a horror novel by Steve Alten, The Loch.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{a passionate}} traveller, and he visited both the North and South poles. Mihailo Petrović got the {{nickname}} [...] "Alas" [...] {{because of his}} passion for fishery.

25|$|An inquest {{into the}} wreck was {{scheduled}} for August 30. The inquest determined that flooding caused by the hurricane had undermined the bridge's piers. There was concern that dredging of the river's bottom, which {{had been going on}} since the bridge was completed, may have cause the velocity of the river to speed up and helped undermine the bridge's foundation. <b>But</b> <b>experts</b> from the Interstate Commerce Commission ruled this out in November 1933.|$|E
25|$|Blood {{pressure}} readings do vary <b>but</b> <b>experts</b> recommend that blood pressure should not range above 140/80. Secondly, {{high blood pressure}} is a silent disease and thus it is vital for all diabetics to regularly check their blood pressure or have it checked at a doctor's office on a regular basis. The American Diabetes Association recommends that all diabetics get their blood pressure measured by a health care professional at least 2-5 times a year.|$|E
50|$|In the Soviet Union, {{reactors}} {{were considered}} too expensive, until Brezhnev came to power. Under his leadership, Anatoly Petrovich Alexandrov designed cheap reactors that were produced at high speed, {{with very few}} safety features, sometimes not even containment vessels.

5000|$|Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote [...] "Despite {{the rather}} bleak setting and content, A Marine Story has tough-love humor and affection for its characters, who become very likable as things proceed. A violent blast of climactic meth-lab drama works well, as does a poignant, {{reserved}} coda. Through it all, Weber (the helmer's spouse and star of his prior feature, The Gymnast) is first-rate, and other cast members are assured; ditto the modest <b>but</b> <b>expert</b> assembly." ...|$|R
25|$|Apart from {{comparisons}} between HFCS and table sugar, {{there is some}} evidence that the overconsumption of added sugar in any form, including HFCS, is a major health problem, especially for onset of obesity. Consuming added sugars, particularly as sweetened soft drinks, is strongly linked to weight gain. The World Health Organization has recommended that people limit their consumption of added sugars to 10% of calories, <b>but</b> <b>experts</b> say that typical consumption of empty calories in the United States is nearly twice that level.|$|E
25|$|On 12 August 2011, {{researchers}} from the U.S. described a fossil of a pregnant plesiosaur found on a Kansas ranch in 1987. The plesiosauroid, Polycotylus latippinus, has confirmed that these predatory marine reptiles gave birth to single, large, live offspring - contrary to other marine reptile reproduction which typically involves {{a large number of}} small babies. Before this study, plesiosauroids had sometimes been portrayed crawling out of water to lay eggs in the manner of sea turtles, <b>but</b> <b>experts</b> had long suspected that their anatomy was not compatible to movement on land. The adult plesiosaur measures 4 m long and the baby is 1.5 m long.|$|E
25|$|Many {{witnesses}} {{testified that}} portholes across {{the ship had}} been open {{at the time of}} the sinking, and an expert witness confirmed that such a porthole three feet under water would let in four tons of water per minute. Testimony varied on how many torpedoes there had been, and whether the strike occurred between the first and second funnel, or third and fourth. The nature of the official cargo was considered, <b>but</b> <b>experts</b> considered that under no conditions could the cargo have exploded. A record exists that Crewman Jack Roper wrote to Cunard in 1919 requesting expenses for his testimony in accord with the line indicated by Cunard.|$|E

500|$|In 1934, Birkett {{acted as}} {{counsel for the}} second of the two Brighton trunk murders, a case which was {{described}} as [...] "his greatest triumph in a capital case". In June 1934, a woman's torso was found in a suitcase in Brighton railway station. The legs were discovered at King's Cross station the next day, but her head and arms were never found, and the case is still unsolved. A woman by the name of Violette Kaye had disappeared, and the appearance of the first woman's body prompted greater scrutiny on Kaye's case. On 14 July, they interviewed Toni Mancini, Kaye's boyfriend, who convinced them that the dead woman could not possibly be Kaye; the dead woman had been identified as around thirty five years old and five months pregnant, while Kaye was ten years older. Kaye was last seen alive on 10 May looking distressed in the doorway to her house and had been scheduled to visit her sister in London who received a telegram on 11 May reading [...] "Going abroad. Good job. Sail Sunday. Will write. Vi." [...] in block capitals. The post office clerks could not remember who sent it, <b>but</b> <b>experts</b> testified that the handwriting on the telegram had similarities to that on a menu written by Mancini. On 14 May, with the help of another man, Mancini moved his belongings from the house he shared with Kaye, which included a large trunk which was too heavy to move by hand. Mancini had told people that he had broken up with Kaye and she had moved to Paris, and that before she left he had beaten her. He later said to a friend, [...] "What is the good of knocking a woman about with your fists? You only hurt yourself. You should hit her with a hammer same as I did and [...] her up." [...] A hammerhead was later found in the rubbish at his old house.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, while filmmaker Julie Anne Robinson directed it. Featured music includes Psapp's [...] "King of You", The Whitest Boy Alive's [...] "Fireworks", Iain Archer's [...] "Canal Song", Miho Hatori's [...] "Barracuda" [...] and Sybarite's [...] "Runaway". Rater described that she got the idea after being told {{that her husband had}} to undergo a craniotomy. She noted that the plan for the episode was to focus on Ellis' inner feelings, mainly her fright, frustration and stress. [...] "The concept of someone with this disease having a lucid day is real. The disease varies for everyone, <b>but</b> <b>experts</b> we talked to said that patients have bad days and good days and then sometimes they have great days where it seems like they are their old selves. Maybe it's a moment, maybe an hour, for some a whole afternoon, but we were fascinated with the idea of getting this time, this gift, and knowing that it's only temporary. What would you do with that one day? And what would it mean for Meredith?", stated Rater, explaining the premise of the episode. She also stated that [...] "the cool idea" [...] to have Meredith and Ellis connect again had been considered for almost a year before the actual concept of the episode was written, after numerous attempts to include the storyline in other episodes that [...] "didn't feel quite right": [...] "If you're going to give Meredith her mother back and then take her away again, you'd better have a pretty good reason." [...] Rater also explained that, in her vision, the episode introduces a new period in the interns' lives, focusing on their finding an identity as surgeons, becoming more central than {{in the beginning of the}} season, which revolved around the aftermath of Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)'s death and Meredith's involvement in the love triangle between her, Shepherd and Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell).|$|E
2500|$|According to The Wall Street Journal, Blue Coat's {{devices are}} also used to block the public from viewing certain {{websites}} in Bahrain, Qatar, and U.A.E., among others. By 2013, Citizen Lab had published three reports regarding BlueCoat devices being found in countries known for using technology to violate human rights. It identified 61 countries using Blue Coat devices, including those known for censoring and surveilling their citizens' internet activity, such as China, Egypt, Russia, and Venezuela. According to The Washington Post, [...] "it remains unclear exactly how the technologies are being used, <b>but</b> <b>experts</b> say the tools could empower repressive governments to spy on opponents." ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that academic papers are rarely cited or even read. But {{what kind of}} data lies behind these assertions? Dahlia Remler {{takes a look at}} the academic research on citation practices and finds that whilst it is clear citation rates are low, much confusion remains over precise figures and methods for determining accurate citation analysis. In her investigation, Remler wonders whether academics are able to answer these key questions. <b>But</b> <b>expert</b> evaluation has indeed correctly discredited the overblown claim resulting from embellished journalism...|$|R
5000|$|Cape horse {{mackerel}} (Trachurus capensis) is a pelagic species, usually found {{to a depth}} of 300 m. They are mostly found over the continental shelf, often over sandy bottoms. The shoals rise to feed in surface waters at night, but can be found close to the bottom during the day. Horse mackerel are very abundant in South African and Namibian waters, though much of the catch is exported. Their stock status is uncertain, <b>but</b> <b>expert</b> opinion is that the stock is most likely underfished.|$|R

2500|$|Energy drinks {{have the}} effects that {{caffeine}} and sugar provide, <b>but</b> <b>experts</b> still argue about the possible effects of the other ingredients. Most {{of the effects of}} energy drinks on cognitive performance, such as increased attention and reaction speed, are primarily due to the presence of caffeine. Still there is evidence that energy drinks can increase mental [...] and athletic [...] performance. Performance of prolonged driving, for example is increased significantly after consumption of Red Bull. Other tests for physical performance showed results such as increased endurance and power. Red Bull energy drink significantly increased upper body muscle endurance during repeated Wingate [...] tests in young healthy adults. Excessive or repeated consumption of energy drinks can lead to cardiac and psychiatric conditions.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2012 a Parisian {{auction house}} {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} two previously unknown draft manuscript pages that included new text. In the newly discovered material the Prince meets his first Earthling after his arrival. The person he meets is an [...] "ambassador of the human spirit". The ambassador is too busy to talk, saying he is searching for a missing six letter word: [...] "I am looking for a six-letter word that starts with G that means 'gargling'," [...] he says. Saint-Exupéry's text does not say what the word is, <b>but</b> <b>experts</b> believe it could be [...] "guerre" [...] (or [...] "war"). The novella thus takes a more politicized tack with an anti-war sentiment, as 'to gargle' in French is an informal reference to 'honour', which the author may have viewed as {{a key factor in}} military confrontations between nations.|$|E
2500|$|Atlanta, {{prosecutors}} threatened {{legal action}} if {{the film was}} to be screened in the city, <b>but</b> <b>experts</b> testified in court {{on behalf of the}} film, and Atlanta, too, declared that the film was not obscene. Citizens for Decency through Law, a private watchdog group which protested against films which it deemed immoral, sought to prevent the film's exhibition in Fairlawn, Ohio, {{on the grounds that it}} would be a [...] "public nuisance", leading Penthouse to withdraw the film from exhibition there to avoid another trial. CDL's lawyer advised against attempting to prosecute Penthouse for obscenity and instead recommended a civil proceeding, because the film would not be placed against the Miller test. The Penthouse attorney described the Fairlawn events as being driven by conservative morality reinforced by Ronald Reagan's presidential victory, stating, [...] "Apparently, these extremists have interpreted a change by administration to mean a clarion call for a mandate to shackle the public's mind again." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} several speculations about the game's origins {{including}} some that it was created in France or Flanders.
