40|$|In {{the science}} of {{engineering}} there is knowledge about a well-established procedure for constructing lightweight designs. A critical step within this procedure is {{the search for a}} suitable concept. In the technical field, this critical step is usually solved through practical experience or by using existing constructions serving as models. In nature the evolution has created mature constructional principles which can serve as models for technical lightweight constructions. According to Darwin, only the best adapted individual survives the process of natural selection. Plankton organisms for example have developed highly optimized lightweight shells over several billion years. On the one side they need to have extremely stable and defensive structural components in order to defend themselves against predators. On the other side they must be very economical with their use of construction material to prevent them from sinking into water depths where photosynthesis is no longer possible. In this context, this dissertation examines how to systematically transfer <b>biological</b> <b>construction</b> principles to find innovative technical lightweight solutions. Therefore, a systematical method for building bionic lightweight designs is developed. It uses the potential of plankton shells in order to identify preliminary lightweight designs. To integrate this bionic method into the acknowledged standards of engineering, an addition to the well-established developing process is made. Firstly, the selection process will be examined. Its role is it to identify one or more natural models which suit the technical purpose. A specific search feature enables the rapid finding of suitable natural models within a knowledge repository. A simplified evaluation method is introduced and allows an objective qualification of several constructions regarding load cases. The abstraction of the <b>biological</b> <b>construction</b> principles is then examined {{with the help of a}} modified topology optimization. In the next step, parametric optimization is used as a tool to further specialize the constructional principles. The considered methods and tools are finally tested and examined by applying them to a real life case. In this regard, a foundation structure for offshore wind energy plants is designed...|$|E

This work briefly addresses the state-of-the-art in the fields of cells and scaffolds that have high regenerative potential. Additional tools that are required to reconstruct more complex parts of the body, such as a human arm, seem achievable with the already available more sophisticated culture systems including three-dimensional organization, dynamic condi-tions and co-cultures. Finally, we present results on cell differentiation and cell and tissue maturation in culture when cells are exposed to mechanical forces. We postulate that in the foreseeable future even such complicated structures such as a human arm will be regrown in full in vitro under the conditions of a mechanically controlled co-culture system. ...|$|E
40|$|While Battlestar Galactica reinvigorated {{the science}} fiction genre by {{representing}} contemporary political {{problems in a}} complex, often radical fashion, the series also makes visible a new articulation of eugenic thinking. Postmodern eugenics repurposes turn-of-the 20 th century ideas of racial progress and recombines them with different narratives and ideologies so that audiences may receive them as new and cut off from history. By centering its finale on the survival of one genetically idealized child, Battlestar constructs a new narrative context for an old story that rationalizes the sacrifice of the non-heterosexual, non-reproductive, and non-conformist to build a "better" race.

40|$|Plato theorizes in the Phaedrus the “holy fury” {{as a form}} of poetry. Primordial impulses as the {{foundation}} of art and philosophy are theorized by Nietzsche as well as by Pasolini. After all, Nietzsche and the avant-garde emphasize the “furious”, productive and creative aspect of vitalism. A great number of artists of {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century – each one in his own way and with his own poetic strategy – has tried to give a concrete form to this transfiguration of the conflict between “bare life” and work of art seen as an artificial machinery that aims to accentuate their distance. The paradox of the theorists of “bare life” depends on the fact that they start with remarks based on “science” and Darwin to end up with nihilism, as it is impossible not to observe the transience of life. The possibility to interfere with the body – to “pilot” an individual’s life – opens a way to a biopolitical utopia in a sense of racial homogeneity as well as in a sense of <b>biological</b> <b>construction</b> of a “new human being”.

40|$|Biowall is a woven {{scaffold}} {{that becomes}} a partition wall when colonized by living plants. In their {{attempt to create a}} modular building system based on structures found in nature, the designers looked at several geometries, such as Penrose tiles (pairs of shapes that tile the plane only aperiodically) and Synetic structures (airy, lacelike basketries of thin arcs patterned in curvilinear triangulation). They finally opted for a dodecahedron weave of twelve small circles made of one-millimeter fiberglass rods around which plants would grow and creep. The designers explain that “the construction is based on the principle of self-similarity, translating a <b>biological</b> <b>construction</b> from the nanoscale to the macro scale. It can be seen in our natural environment in the formation of bubbles, living cells, and water molecules. BioWall explores the possibility of using constructed textile techniques on an architectural scale.

This results in structural stability, not because of the strength of individual parts but because the entire structure distributes and balances mechanical stresses evenly. The space-frame uses tangential joints exclusively and is easily scaled to fit any dimension from the nano to the macro world.

40|$|Described in {{this thesis}} are efforts to advance our {{understanding}} of single molecule machines through the synthesis and study of an array of nanovehicles. In the first chapter, nanoscale transport is explored through the synthesis and solution-based studies of a photoactive, metal-ion-chelating nanocar. Utilizing an appended photoactive dipyridylethylene moiety as a metal chelating unit, {{it is expected that}} this molecule, upon photoirradiation, will form a strong bidentate ligand for carrying metal ions along surfaces. Following this, in the second chapter, directional control and propulsion are explored through the synthesis of motorized nanocars. Studies towards a dual-motored nanocar as well as the synthesis of an ultra-fast motorized nanocar are described. The third chapter covers our efforts to complement previous STM studies, where single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy is used for imaging and mechanistic elucidation of translational movement of fluorescently-tagged nanovehicles. The synthetic routes towards these molecules are covered, as well. In chapters 4 and 5, various nanovehicles are synthesized using contrasting approaches. In chapter 4, self-assembly methods mirroring those used in <b>biological</b> <b>construction</b> are used to produce nanocars and nanotrains. Moieties of 2 -pyridones and terpyridyl groups were used for self-assembling via hydrogen bonding and metal complex formation, respectively. Traditional organic synthesis is used to build carborane-wheeled nanovehicles in chapter 5. These molecules are expected to move in predetermined patterns on atomically smooth surfaces, depending on their specific configuration of axles and wheels. Finally, in chapter 6, nanocomponentry is explored through the synthesis and studies of molecular devices such as azobenzene-fullerene switches and fullerene-oligo(phenylene ethynylene) molecular wires. The presence of fullerenes and oligo(phenylene ethynylene) s (OPEs) in azobenzene derivatives was found to have a large effect on the photoisomerization behavior of the molecules. Lastly, a series of fullerene-terminated oligo(phenylene ethynylene) (OPEs) molecular wires have been synthesized as potential molecular electronic devices.
