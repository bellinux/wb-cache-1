5000|$|New {{building}} of the Belgrade Observatory, as previously a rented private house was used, was built and opened on 1 May 1891 on the location of modern park. Top of the Vračar hill was specifically chosen due to its height. The <b>bulding</b> was specifically constructed for that purpose. It was constructed according {{to the design of}} architect Dimitrije T. Leko and equipped with the modern small instruments for astronomical and meteorological observations. Two small astronomical pavilions were also built. The Observatory was a workshop for practical training for the students of the Grand School and People’s Observatory, but was opened for the citizens, too - for example, in 1910 the Halley's comet was observed. Apart from its importance for astronomy and meteorology, the newly built Observatory was a cradle of the seismic and geomagnetic researches in Serbia as the observatory was equipped with an seismograph. In 1924, by ruling of the Faculty Council the Observatory was divided into two separate institutions: Astronomical Observatory and Meteorological Observatory of Belgrade University. In 1929 funds were granted for the constructions of a new, modern, observatory, at 6 km distance southeast from the city's centre, at the 253 m high hill on Veliki Vračar, while the old building remained a meteorological observatory. As original Serbian word for an observatory was zvezdara, old building became known as the [...] "Stara Zvezdara" [...] (Old Zvezdara) while the new observatory was simply called [...] "Zvezdara", giving its name to the Veliki Vračar hill, the surrounding forest, the neighborhood which developed later and the modern municipality of Zvezdara.|$|E

Reports suggested that the company was working on a fourth installment in the series, tentatively titled Lego Racers 4, and another title, Lego Racers CC, was advertised in Lego catalogs in 2004, though no further information on either has become known since. In January 2007, Kiloo announced that they were developing two new Lego-themed video games for mobile phones, on of which was titled Lego Racers and featured an original take on the 1999 game's machanics, projecting a 2007 release. The game was released by Hands-On Mobile in June 2008 to mixed reception, with critics stating that the game lacked any depth and made null and void of the actual usage of Lego bricks in the game. On December 18, 2007, NetDevil, at the time in charge of developing Lego Universe, announced that it had opened a new web-focused division, which was tasked with developing an Adobe Flash-based remake of Lego Racers, with a projected release date of Q1 2018. NetDevil stated that the move was done in order to compete with other browser games, such as Club Penguin and RuneScape, and build upon an older web-based Lego Racers game, entitled Drome Racers Challenge. No further news on the game were ever released, and a new game, titled Lego Racers: The Video Game, started appearing on Lego box prints in late 2008, but again saw no news afterwards.

The fundamental mechanism of B-O defect permanent deactivation has been highly debatable between two different leading theories/ This thesis will propose a four-state model to demonstrate the possibility of the co-existence of the H-based and H-free deactivation paths. In addition, an unusual LID defect was discovered to exhibit uncommon characteristics.

40|$|The aim in {{view was}} {{investigation}} ofthe regenerative potential of rhizomes, bulbs and corms of ten monocotyledonous plant species from four families: Amaryllidaceae (Haemanthus katharinae, Crinum abyssinicum, Leucojum vernum), Araceae (Spathiphyllum wallisii), Iridaceae (Crocus vernus, Iris germanica), Liliaceae (Hosta lancifolia, Muscari racemosum, Scilla laxiflora, Veltheimia viridifolia) {{under conditions of}} in vitro culture. All the investigated species were capable of <b>buld</b> or, alternatively, bud and root regeneration. Different morphogenetic potential was noted between the particular families. A high regenerative potential under the conditions of culture applied was characteristic for plants of the Liliaceae and Araceae families, it was lower in plants belonging to Amaryllidaceae and lowest in those of the Iridaceae family. Plants from the Liliaceae family exhibited also the highest ability of callus formation, whereas Amaryllidaceae and Iridaceae plants possessed this ability in only a low degree. The influence of growth regulators of the auxin group (NAA, IAA, 2, 4 -D) and of cytokinins (K) on the initiation and course of organogenesis was tested. The results of the experiments indicate that auxins in interaction with kinetin gave {{the highest percentage of}} regenerating explants and also a large number of buds on the latter.

This study was carried out to investigate the possibility of improving degraded soil conditions of Andigama series by intercropping with Gliricidia sepium under coconut. Gliricida sepium was established in a 45 year old coconut plantation in double rows of 2 m x 1 m and arranged in a Randomized Block design with four replicates. The effect on soil physical characters such as texture, bulk density, aeration capacity, moisture retention and root distribution pattern of Gliricidia sepium were studied. Results revealed that clay faction cemented with gravel significantly increased (P 0. 05) bulk density (1. 62 +- 0. 07). it acts as a physical barrier and reduced readily available water fraction in B horizon. the available water fraction in A, AB and B horizons decreased by 66 before reaching 1 bar (100 kPa) suction in 7, 9 and 11 days respectively during the dry period. Root proliferation of Gliricidia sepium through hard layers significantly reduced the <b>buld</b> density (P 0. 001) which resulted in improving aeration capacity, total and readily available water. Moreover, results showed that with the improved soil conditions by Gliricidia sepoum, coconut root growth also increased by 5. 3 per cent, 91 per cent and 21 per cent in A, AB and B horizons repectively.

A general expression for concentration profiles was derived for materials with a constant distribution coefficient and a method for the rapid estimation of these concentration profiles was developed, Numerical results for eutectic-forming systems were obtained, and summarized in an analytical approximation. Economic calculations are included for a separation in the multistaged semicontinuous zone refiner known as a zone-void refiner. Exploratory experiments were made on a cooled-drum apparatus (modified drum- flaker), using NaC 1 -water as a system.
