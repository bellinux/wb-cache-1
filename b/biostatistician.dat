In many countries, trained <b>biostatisticians</b> are not readily available.

The International Clinical Epidemiology Network (INCLEN) embarked on such an endeavour by creating clinical epidemiology units that included both approaches, trained clinical epidemiologists as well as <b>biostatisticians.</b> The specific statistical training needs of both types of students are described. 1...|$|R

While mentoring has been proposed as an effective strategy for knowledge and skills transfer in biostatistics and related fields, there is still much to be done to facilitate adoption by stakeholders, including academia and employers of <b>biostatisticians.</b> This is especially troubling given that <b>biostatisticians</b> {{play a key role in}} the success or otherwise of clinical research conducted for evidence-based decisions. In this paper, we offer suggestions on how mentoring can be applied in practice to advance the statistical training of future <b>biostatisticians.</b> In particular, we propose steps that academic statistics departments, professional statistical societies, and statistics organizations can take to advance the mentoring of young <b>biostatisticians.</b> Our suggestions also cover what mentors and mentees can do to facilitate a successful mentoring relationship.

2500|$|Elvin Morton [...] "Bunky" [...] Jellinek (15 August 1890 – 22 October 1963), E. Morton Jellinek, or most often, E. M.
