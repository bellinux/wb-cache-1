25|$|Antibody class {{switching}} declines significantly once helper T cell function fails. The immune system loses {{its ability to}} improve the affinity of their antibodies, and are unable to generate B cells that can produce antibody groups such as IgG and IgA. These effects are primarily due {{to the loss of}} any helper T cell that can interact with the <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> correctly. Another symptom of AIDS is the reduction in antibody levels due to a decrease in Th2 cytokines (and less interactions by helper T cells). All of these complications result in an increased susceptibility to aggressive bacterial infections, especially in areas of the body not accessible by IgM antibodies.|$|E
25|$|IgE, the IgE {{synthesis}} pathway, and the IgE-mediated allergic/inflammatory pathway are {{all important}} targets in intervening with the pathological processes of allergy, asthma, and other IgE-mediated diseases. The <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> differentiation and maturation pathway that eventually generate IgE-secreting plasma cells {{go through the}} intermediate steps of IgE-expressing B lymphoblasts and involves the interaction with IgE-expressing memory B cells. Tanox, a biotech company based in Houston, Texas, proposed in 1987 that by targeting membrane-bound IgE (mIgE) on B lymphoblast and memory B cells, those cells can be lysed or down-regulated, thus achieving the inhibition of the production of antigen-specific IgE and hence a shift of immune balance toward non-IgE mechanisms. Two approaches targeting the IgE pathway were evolved and both are in active development. In the first approach, the anti-IgE antibody drug omalizumab (trade name Xolair) recognises IgE not bound to its receptors and is used to neutralise or mop-up existing IgE and prevent it from binding to the receptors on mast cells and basophils. Xolair has been approved in many countries for treating severe, persistent allergic asthma. It has also been approved in March 2014 in the European Union and the U. S. for treating chronic spontaneous urticaria, which cannot be adequately treated with H1-antihistamines. In the second approach, antibodies specific for a domain of 52 amino acid residues, referred to as CεmX or M1’ (M1 prime), present only on human mIgE on B cells and not on free, soluble IgE, have been prepared and are under clinical development {{for the treatment of}} allergy and asthma. An anti-M1’ humanized antibody, quilizumab, is in phase IIb clinical trial.|$|E

Neither a-beta 2 m IgG fraction nor F(ab') 2 had a mitogenic effect on either highly purified T or <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> alone, while their mitogenic effect was observed when T and <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were appropriately reconstituted. When T lymphocytes were reconstituted with mitomycin C (MMC) treated <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> a negligible decrease in the response to a-beta 2 m was observed compared to the response of an untreated mixture to a-beta 2 m. On the other hand, when <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were reconstituted with MMC-treated T lymphocytes, the response was markedly diminished.

This study shows that IL- 10 and SDF- 1 act in synergy on peritoneal <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Indeed, autocrine production of IL- 10 was absolutely required for all effects of SDF- 1 on these cells, including increased proliferation, survival, and chemotaxis. Moreover, adding IL- 10 to peritoneal <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> increased the effects of SDF- 1. Neither IL- 5, IL- 6, nor IL- 9 affected the response of peritoneal <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> to SDF- 1.

500|$|The {{antibody}} isotype of a B cell {{changes during}} cell development and activation. Immature B cells, which {{have never been}} exposed to an antigen, express only the IgM isotype in a cell surface bound form. The <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte,</b> in this ready-to-respond form, {{is known as a}} [...] "naive B lymphocyte." [...] The naive <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> expresses both surface IgM and IgD. The co-expression of both of these immunoglobulin isotypes renders the B cell ready to respond to antigen. B cell activation follows engagement of the cell-bound antibody molecule with an antigen, causing the cell to divide and differentiate into an antibody-producing cell called a plasma cell. In this activated form, the B cell starts to produce antibody in a secreted form rather than a membrane-bound form. Some daughter cells of the activated B cells undergo isotype switching, a mechanism that causes the production of antibodies to change from IgM or IgD to the other antibody isotypes, IgE, IgA, or IgG, that have defined roles in the immune system.|$|E
