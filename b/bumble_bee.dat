5|$|A {{bumblebee}} (also written <b>bumble</b> <b>bee)</b> is {{a member}} of the genus Bombus, part of Apidae, one of the bee families. This genus is the only extant group in the tribe Bombini, though a few extinct related genera (e.g., Calyptapis) are known from fossils. Over 250 species of bumblebee are known. They are found primarily in higher altitudes or latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, although they are also found in South America where a few lowland tropical species have been identified. European bumblebees have also been introduced to New Zealand and Tasmania. The brood parasitic or cuckoo bumblebees have sometimes been classified as a subgenus or genus, Psithyrus, but are now usually treated as members of Bombus.|$|E

50|$|Since {{bees are}} {{characterized}} by a distinct color pattern {{as well as a}} defensive sting, they have been subject to mimicry in order to gain its known protective mark. <b>Bumble</b> <b>bees</b> are resembled by sawflies, other bees, day-flying moths, beetles, and flies. Cimbicid sawflies resemble bees, but have swollen antenna tips as a distinguisher. Other bees, such as carpenter and digger bees, contain a striking resemblance to <b>bumble</b> <b>bees,</b> but males contain a yellow clypeus and females have hindlegs with brushes rather than a pollen basket, which is a characteristic of <b>bumble</b> <b>bees.</b> Clearwing hawk moths (of the family Sphingidae such as the species Hemaris thetis) resemble <b>bumble</b> <b>bees</b> while foraging through flowers, but are distinct with skinny legs and spindle antennae. Bumble flower beetles (Scarabaeidae such as Euphoria inda) maintains a similar flight behavior to <b>bumble</b> <b>bees</b> like flying close to plants and buzzing loudly. The longhorned beetle also has a color scheme paralleling <b>bumble</b> <b>bees.</b> Flower flies are especially similar mimics of <b>bumble</b> <b>bees,</b> such as the robber fly, deer bot fly, and <b>bee</b> fly. <b>Bumble</b> <b>bees</b> have developed Müllerian mimicry, when poisonous species mimic other dangerous species' warning signals, as a reinforced defense against predators.|$|R
5|$|Ten {{species of}} fungi {{have been found}} on the Asiatic dayflower, four of which can infect the plant, while 12 species of insects {{are known to be}} {{associated}} with it. Two of the fungi, Kordyana commelinae and Phyllosticta commelinicola, are thought to be host specific with the Asiatic dayflower. Of the ten fungi seven are Basidiomycota and three are Ascomycota. Nine of the 12 insects associated with the plant are beetles, seven of which are in the genus Lema, while the other two are in the families Hispidae and Pentatomidae. The remaining three insects include one species of moth, Pergesa acteus, and two true bugs, namely Aphis commilinae and Aeschrocoris ceylonicus. Important pollinators include the Asian honeybee, Apis cerana, syrphid fly, Episyrphus balteatus, and the <b>bumble</b> <b>bee</b> species Bombus diversus.|$|E

25|$|The Monotropoideae are {{adapted for}} {{pollination}} by bumble bees (Bombus), including specialized buzz pollination {{in a few}} genera.

25|$|E. imperialis {{construct}} their nests with cells clumped {{in a single}} cluster, like <b>bumble</b> <b>bee</b> (Bombus) nests, such that it forms a globular structure rather than a comb structure. The nest chamber is approximately spherical in shape with a diameter of 13cm. The walls are lined with a dark resinous substance thick {{on the floor and}} thin at the ceiling. The oldest cells form the bottom layer of the nest, with new cells added on top of each layer. The larvae typically occupy the older cells with eggs in the newer cells. The inner walls of the cells are smooth, whereas the exterior is rough.|$|E
25|$|The 1969 {{model year}} brought few modifications. Exterior changes {{included}} a new grille with a center divider and new longitudinal taillights, both designed by Harvey J. Winn.

The SE added leather inserts to the front seats only, chrome rocker moldings, a wood grain steering wheel, and wood grain inserts on the instrument panel.

Instead of four stripes, it now consisted of a wide stripe framed by two smaller stripes. In the middle of the stripe, an R/T cutout was placed.

40|$|International audienceThe insect growth {{regulators}} (IGRs) are ecdysone or {{juvenile hormone}} mimics, or chitin synthesis inhibitors.

40|$|International audienceHere {{we provide}} the first {{evidence}} that Black Queen Cell Virus (BQCV), {{one of the most}} prevalent honey bee viruses, can cause an infection in <b>bumble</b> <b>bees,</b> Bombus huntii, and that the BQCV infection could spread to different tissues of <b>bumble</b> <b>bees.</b> The detection of negative strand RNA of BQCV, an indicator of active virus replication, in the gut of B. huntii suggests that virus particles replicate within the gut and then cross the gut lining to other tissues through hemolymph circulation. The observation of active replication of the BQCV in the gut, together with the fact that BQCV was more widespread in the body of field-collected bees than that of lab-reared bees, implies a possible association between the foraging activities of <b>bumble</b> <b>bees</b> and virus transmission.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Biology, 2000 <b>Bumble</b> <b>bees</b> (Bombus: Apidae) can {{maximize}} foraging {{efficiency in}} a resource-patchy environment by visiting mainly rewarding flowers and avoiding {{those that are}} either empty or less rewarding. This study investigated how <b>bumble</b> <b>bees</b> avoid unrewarding flowers of lupine (Lupinus: Fabaceae), a plant in which the pollen is hidden from view. I recorded whether bees left a whorl upon encountering various situations. <b>Bumble</b> <b>bees</b> clearly discriminated against flowers that showed unambiguous visual signs of being unrewarding. In {{the absence of any}} visual cues, bees made use of a presumably predictable spatial distribution of pollen within whorls. They were able to assess the amount of pollen collected per flower, and they departed upon encountering one or more unrewarding flowers. Bees did not use pollen scent to avoid unrewarding flowers, which cannot be identified by scent alone. By basing their foraging decisions only on the most reliable signals <b>bumble</b> <b>bees</b> may have maximized their pollen return...|$|R
