50|$|An {{aggressive}} bull may be kept {{confined in}} a bull pen: a robustly-constructed shelter and pen, often with an arrangement {{to allow the}} bull to be fed without entering the pen. If an aggressive bull is allowed to graze outside, additional precautions {{may be needed to}} help avoid his harming people. One method is a <b>bull</b> <b>mask,</b> which either covers the bull's eyes completely, or restricts his vision to the ground immediately in front of him, so he cannot see his potential victim. Another method is to attach a length of chain to the bull's nose-ring, so that if he ducks his head to charge, he steps on the chain and is brought up short. Alternatively, the bull may be hobbled, or chained by his ring or by a collar to a solid object such as a ring concreted into the ground.|$|E

He further added the opinion that Haddock's transformation from seaman to country gentleman was not believable.He suggested that the appearance of Yamila and Castafiore {{at the start of the}} story injected [...] "a feminine element" [...] into the story, which represented an attempt to [...] "round out Haddock's family", which was dominated by the male figures of Tintin, Calculus, and Snowy. He further argued that Calculus' kidnapping represented a [...] "rite of passage" [...] that would allow him to join Tintin and Haddock's family.|$|R

2500|$|Traditional dance {{generally}} {{involves the}} history and/or the cosmology {{of the people}} who perform it, and {{is a part of the}} social cohesion of that group. While varying widely, many folk dances in Mexico share some common elements. Animals that appear in these dances are generally those that were religiously significant to pre-Hispanic indigenous people. These animals include deer, serpents, eagles, and jaguars. [...] After the Conquest, dancers added other animalssuch as horses, <b>bulls,</b> and roosters. <b>Masks</b> are used in various ways in Mexican dance. They can be used to “transform” the dancer into a character, either metaphorically or religiously, it can be used to hide the dancer’s identity for festivals such as Carnival to allow for pranks and/or it can be used for social commentary, for example a farmer wearing a mask and military-style clothing to protest corrupt police. The use of mirrors on costumes are to represent the life force of the sun as its light is reflected as the dancers move.|$|R
500|$|Zhang's long lyrical poems also {{revealed}} {{a great amount}} of information on urban layout and basic geography. His rhapsody [...] "Sir Based-On-Nothing" [...] provides details on terrain, palaces, hunting parks, markets, and prominent buildings of Chang'an, the Western Han capital. Exemplifying his attention to detail, his rhapsody on Nanyang described gardens filled with spring garlic, summer bamboo shoots, autumn leeks, winter rape-turnips, perilla, evodia, and purple ginger. Zhang Heng's writing confirms the size of the imperial hunting park in the suburbs of Chang'an, as his estimate for the circumference of the park's encircling wall agrees with the historian Ban Gu's estimate of roughly 400li (one li in Han times was equal to 415.8m, or 1,364ft, making the circumference of the park wall 166,320m, or 545,600ft). Along with Sima Xiangru (179–117BC), Zhang listed a variety of animals and hunting game inhabiting the park, which were divided in the northern and southern portions of the park according to where the animals had originally came from: northern or southern China. Somewhat similar to the description of Sima Xiangru, Zhang described the Western Han emperors and their entourage enjoying boat outings, water plays, fishing, and displays of archery targeting birds and other animals with stringed arrows from the tops of [...] along Chang'an's Kunming Lake. The focus of Zhang's writing on specific places and their terrain, society, people, and their customs could also be seen as early attempts of ethnographic categorization. In his poem [...] "Xijing fu", Zhang shows that he was aware of the new foreign religion of Buddhism, introduced via the Silk Road, as well as the legend of the birth of Buddha with the vision of the white elephant bringing about conception. In his [...] "Western Metropolis Rhapsody" [...] (西京賦), Zhang described court entertainments such as juedi (角抵), a form of theatrical wrestling accompanied by music in which participants butted heads with <b>bull</b> horn <b>masks.</b>|$|R

Most Mexican traditional dance shows indigenous and/or European heritage, but there are some that show the country’s African past, especially in Veracruz and the Costa Chica region in Guerrero and Oaxaca. Like indigenous dances, African based ones often involved the use of masks, costumes and other props that carry various meanings with the dances themselves function as a form of social cohesion. In Veracruz, best known “African” dances include Los Negritos, along with various huapangos and sons. In the Costa Chica, the best known of these dances include Los Diablos, Las Tortugas and Toro de Petate.|$|R
