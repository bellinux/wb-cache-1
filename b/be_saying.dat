5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E

25|$|Evgenii is accorded equal {{status with}} Peter in purely human terms, and his {{rebellion}} against state power {{is shown to}} be as admirable and significant in its way {{as that of the}} Decembrists. Yet turning now to the question of Evgenii’s role in the wider scheme of things, we have to admit that he seems an insignificant third factor in the equation when viewed {{against the backdrop of the}} titanic struggle taking place between Peter and the elements. Evgenii is utterly and completely helpless against both. The flood sweeps away all his dreams of happiness, and it is in the river that he meets his death. Peter’s statue, which at their first ‘encounter’ during the flood had its back turned to Evgenii as if ignoring him, late hounds him mercilessly when he dares to protest at Peter’s role in his suffering. The vast, impersonal forces of order and chaos, locked in an unending struggle– these,Pushkin seems to <b>be</b> <b>saying,</b> are the reality: these are the millstones of destiny or of the historical process to which Evgenii and his kind are but so much grist.|$|E

500|$|Media {{response}} to Intimacy Remixed was generally negative. Emily Tartanella of PopMatters {{explained that the}} remixers' efforts ultimately make Bloc Party's work [...] "less engaging, less meaningful". Ben Patashnik of NME stated that the album is largely monotonous and includes too many pedestrian experiments in dance music. Drowned in Sound's Chris Power indicated that [...] "in putting their names to the album Bloc Party seem to <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> they either don't care about what they ask fans to spend their money on or they don't know much about electronic music".|$|E

500|$|Historians have {{expressed}} criticism for Brezhnev and his rule. The scholarly literature dealing {{with him is}} scarce and, {{with the exception of}} the period immediately after his death, overwhelmingly negative. Very little has been written about Brezhnev in English, and even Russian literature. According to Mark Sandle and Edwin Bacon, the authors behind Brezhnev Reconsidered, Brezhnev had attracted little attention from the media due to a consensus of his rule that was formed shortly after his death; literally that his rule was one primarily of stagnation. When Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, initiated perestroika he blamed the degradation of the Soviet economic and political system on Brezhnev, and called his rule the [...] "Era of Stagnation". Gorbachev claimed that Brezhnev followed [...] "a fierce neo-Stalinist line", although in a later statement Gorbachev made assurances that Brezhnev was not as bad as he was made out to <b>be,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Brezhnev was nothing like the cartoon figure that is made of him now".|$|E

500|$|The album {{features}} aggressive multi-tracking of D'Angelo's voice, {{a technique}} {{similar to the}} production of Sly & the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On (1971) and Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On (1973). The multi-tracking on Voodoo significantly affected the clarity of D'Angelo's vocals. In Voodoos liner notes, Saul Williams wrote of its heavy use of multi-tracking, stating [...] "You might respond, 'Lyrics? Yo, I can't even understand half the shit that D'Angelo <b>be</b> <b>saying.</b> That nigga sounds like Bobby McFerrin on opium'. And I'd say, 'You're right. Neither can I. But I am drawn {{to figure out what it}} is that he's saying. His vocal collaging intrigues me'". Music writers have also noted the production style and sound of Voodoo as reminiscent of the sound of the P-Funk opus Mothership Connection (1975), Gaye's downtempo disco-soul record I Want You (1976), and Miles Davis's jazz fusion works In a Silent Way (1969) and Bitches Brew (1970).|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "one of the most dismally unfunny episodes ever, lifted only by the brief {{appearance}} of a talking camel and Homer's clever way of getting Cooder and Spud out of his home. Whereas most of the series' politically incorrect moments are funny and well-observed, this episode seems to <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> that fairground folk and travelers really are deeply unpleasant criminals who are both irredeemable and unworthy of help. Nasty-taste-in-the-mouth time." [...] Despite the negative review from I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Isaac Mitchell-Frey of the Herald Sun described the episode as [...] "brilliant", and highlighted it along with episodes [...] "The Trouble with Trillions" [...] and [...] "The Joy of Sect" [...] {{and it has been}} described by the other Simpsons writers in the DVD audio commentary as [...] "criminally underrated".|$|E
500|$|Brezhnev {{presided over}} the Soviet Union for longer than any other person except Joseph Stalin. He is often criticised for the {{prolonged}} Era of Stagnation, in which fundamental economic problems were ignored and the Soviet political system was allowed to decline. During Mikhail Gorbachev's tenure as leader {{there was an increase}} in criticism of the Brezhnev years, such as claims that Brezhnev followed [...] "a fierce neo-Stalinist line". The Gorbachevian discourse blamed Brezhnev for failing to modernise the country and to change with the times, although in a later statement Gorbachev made assurances that Brezhnev was not as bad as he was made out to <b>be,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Brezhnev was nothing like the cartoon figure that is made of him now." [...] The intervention in Afghanistan, {{which was one of the}} major decisions of his career, also significantly undermined both the international standing and the internal strength of the Soviet Union. In Brezhnev's defence, it can be said that the Soviet Union reached unprecedented and never-repeated levels of power, prestige, and internal calm under his rule.|$|E

500|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, Homer and Kogen are in Moe's tavern, {{discussing}} their favourite football teams with Moe. When Moe mentions that his favourite team is the Atlanta Falcons, he holds a glass {{in front of his}} mouth, obscuring his lip movements. He then passes the same glass to Homer, who does the same. Originally, the characters would <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> something else, however, because the staff wanted the episode to be [...] "current", new dialogue was recorded for the scene. Because {{there was no time to}} animate the scene from scratch, the staff simply made the characters hold a glass in front of their mouths while saying their lines. This technique was also used in reference to the ongoing impeachment scandal, as when the characters mention that the President and First Lady will be there, they cover their mouths when calling them by name. The song that plays during the bus trip to the Super Bowl was performed by NRBQ. The episode also features British rock band Blur's [...] "Song 2", which plays during the [...] "race" [...] to the stadium.|$|E
500|$|An unusual rhetorical device, hendiadys, {{appears in}} several places in the play. Examples are found in Ophelia's speech {{at the end of}} the nunnery scene: [...] "Thexpectancy and rose of the fair state" [...] and [...] "And I, of ladies most deject and wretched". Many {{scholars}} have found it odd that Shakespeare would, seemingly arbitrarily, use this rhetorical form throughout the play. One explanation may be that Hamlet was written later in Shakespeare's life, when he was adept at matching rhetorical devices to characters and the plot. Linguist George T. Wright suggests that hendiadys had been used deliberately to heighten the play's sense of duality and dislocation. Pauline Kiernan argues that Shakespeare changed English drama forever in Hamlet because he [...] "showed how a character's language can often <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> several things at once, and contradictory meanings at that, to reflect fragmented thoughts and disturbed feelings". She gives the example of Hamlet's advice to Ophelia, [...] "get thee to a nunnery", which is simultaneously a reference to a place of chastity and a slang term for a brothel, reflecting Hamlet's confused feelings about female sexuality.|$|E
500|$|Jarrow's {{script was}} [...] "almost entirely based on Hubbard's own {{writings}} and the church's literature", though Jarrow was {{also influenced by}} critical journalistic accounts. [...] He also drew on the [...] "awkward woodenness of Christmas pageants — the fact that children are often made to say large words that don't sound natural coming out of their mouths." [...] Timbers said they chose to stick to Church of Scientology primary source material for background on the script because [...] "We thought {{that the best way}} to satirize the Church of Scientology was to let the Church speak for itself." [...] During production, the creative team worked with cast members to educate them about the play's background. [...] "Kids shouldn't just <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> things that they don't understand. That's what we're criticizing...people who just parrot behavior and language. We wanted to have an honest conversation with them," [...] Jarrow said. [...] The published version of the script says that the musical should not be performed by adults; Jarrow said adults are [...] "too jaded", and would not be able to portray the [...] "unwinking satire" [...] of the piece.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the film}} was released, rumors and {{allegations}} began to circulate that Battlefield Earth contained subliminal messages promoting Scientology. Former Scientologist Lawrence Wollersheim, in a press release issued by his group Fight Against Coercive Tactics Network, said that the Church of Scientology [...] "has placed highly advanced subliminal messages in the Battlefield Earth film master to surreptitiously recruit new members from the movie audience {{and to get the}} audience to develop a revulsion for psychiatry and current mental health organizations and practices". Other critics said that the film [...] "is a veiled attempt to gain converts and influence", and that writers were gagged from making connections between Scientology and the film with threats of lawsuits. Warner Bros. dismissed the claims as [...] "silly nonsense", the Church of Scientology denounced them as [...] "hogwash" [...] and the media reacted with skepticism; as the Scottish journalist Duncan Campbell put it, [...] "the only subliminal voice I could detect came about 10minutes into this 121-minute film and it seemed to <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> Leeeaaave thisssss cinemmmaaa nooow". When asked about the similarities between the film and Scientology beliefs in intergalactic travel and aliens, church spokesman Aron Mason stated, [...] "That's a pretty crude parallel… You'd have to make some serious leaps of logic to make that comparison." [...] John Travolta also stated that {{the film was}} not inspired by Scientology tenets.|$|E
500|$|This {{follows from}} the causal theory of reference. Words always refer {{to the kinds of}} things they were coined to refer to, thus the kinds of things their user, or the user's ancestors, {{experience}}d. So, if some person, Mary, were a [...] "brain in a vat", whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by the [...] "mad scientist", then Mary's idea of a [...] "brain" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] brain, since she and her linguistic community have never seen such a thing. Rather, she saw something that looked like a brain, but was actually an image fed to her through the wiring. Similarly, her idea of a [...] "vat" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] vat. So, if, as a brain in a vat, she were to say [...] "I'm a brain in a vat", she would actually <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "I'm a brain-image in a vat-image", which is incoherent. On the other hand, if she is not a brain in a vat, then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent, but now because she actually means the opposite. This is a form of epistemological externalism: knowledge or justification depends on factors outside the mind and is not solely determined internally.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} album, Wentz drew lyrical {{inspiration}} from rapper Lil Wayne, whom he called [...] "the best lyricist of [...]" [...] Speaking of Infinity on Highs lyrical themes, Wentz stated, [...] "On the last record, the lyrics were about 'This is where we're {{going to be}} a year from now, and this is what you're going to <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> about us.' But this time, we realized that a lot of bands should spend less time running their mouths and more time writing their songs." [...] In 2013, Wentz reflected, [...] "on a record like Infinity on High, I feel like I tried really hard to explain my perspective – and when I look back on it in hindsight I think it’s an extremely unrelatable record. Critics felt that much of the lyrics address the band's rise to fame and the pressure of maintaining a loyal fanbase. Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker commented that [...] "The only top-ten acts that talk about fame as much as Fall Out Boy does are rappers, although their take on selling records is less conflicted." [...] Cory Apar of Allmusic opined that [...] "Wentz' lyrics are oftentimes resentful, full of fame-induced angst, and really emphasize his need to drive home his position that stardom has not changed the band." ...|$|E
