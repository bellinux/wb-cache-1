25|$|When Europeans {{began to}} settle in Maryland in the early 17th century, the main tribes {{included}} the Nanticoke on the Eastern Shore, and the Iroquoian speaking Susquehannock. Early exposure to new European diseases brought widespread fatalities to the Native Americans, as they had no immunity to them. Communities were disrupted by such losses. Furthermore, The Susquehannock, already incorrectly considered savages and cannibals by the first Spanish explorers, made massive moves to control local trade with the first Swedish, Dutch and English settlers of the Chesapeake Bay region. As the century wore on, the Susquehannock would <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> in the Beaver Wars, a war with the neighboring Lenape, a war with the Dutch, a war with the English, {{and a series of}} wars with the colonial government of Maryland. Due to colonial land claims, the exact territory of the Susquehannock was originally limited to the territory immediately surrounding the Susquehanna River, however archaeology has discovered settlements of theirs dating to the 14th and 15th centuries around the Maryland-West Virginia border, and beyond. It could generally be assumed that most of Maryland's southern border is based on the borders of their own land. All of these wars, coupled with disease, destroyed the tribe and the last of their people were offered refuge from the Iroquois Confederacy to the north shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the sad state of public transit is a very basic one - the transit systems just do not offer a service which will attract people away from their automobiles. Consequently, their {{patronage}} comes very largely from those who cannot drive, either because they are too young, too old, or because they are too poor to own and operate an automobile. Look {{at it from the}} standpoint of a commuter who lives in a suburb and is trying to get to work in the central business district (CBD). If he is going to go by transit, a typical scenario might be the following: he must first walk to the closest bus stop, let us say a five or ten minute walk, and then he may have to wait up to another ten minutes, possibly in inclement weather, for the bus to arrive. When it arrives, he may have to stand unless he is lucky enough to find a seat. The bus will <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> in street congestion and move slowly, and it will make many stops completely unrelated to his trip objective. The bus may then let him off at a terminal to a suburban train. Again he must wait, and, after boarding the train, again experience a number of stops {{on the way to the}} CBD, and possibly again he may have to stand in the aisle. He will get off at the station most convenient to his destination and possibly have to transfer again onto a distribution system. It is no wonder that in those cities where ample inexpensive parking is available, most of those who can drive do drive.|$|E

500|$|The Earth and its Moon are {{one example}} of this configuration. Today, the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth; one of its {{revolutions}} around the Earth (currently about 29 days) is equal to one of its rotations about its axis, so it always shows one face to the Earth. The Moon will continue to recede from Earth, and Earth's spin will continue to slow gradually.

500|$|The Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions {{met at the}} 1921 Imperial Conference to {{determine}} a unified international policy, particularly {{the relationship with the}} United States and Japan. The most urgent issue was that of whether or not to renew the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, which was due to expire on 13 July 1921. On one side were the Prime Minister of Australia Billy Hughes and the Prime Minister of New Zealand Bill Massey, who strongly favoured its renewal. Neither wanted their countries to <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> in a war between the United States and Japan, and contrasted the generous assistance that Japan rendered during the First World War with the United States' disengagement from international affairs in its aftermath. [...] "The British Empire", declared Hughes, [...] "must have a reliable friend in the Pacific". They were opposed by the Prime Minister of Canada, Arthur Meighen, {{on the grounds that the}} alliance would adversely affect the relationship with the United States, which Canada depended upon for its security.

Keyes's suggestion to warn the Earl of Peterborough was, however, derided. On 26October William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle (Tresham's brother-in-law) received an anonymous letter while at his house in Hoxton, warning him not to attend Parliament, and forecasting that [...] "they shall receive a terrible blow this Parliament; and yet they shall not see who hurts them". Uncertain of its meaning he delivered it to Secretary of State Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury. In an extraordinary act of bravado Catesby had planned to go hunting with James, but was warned of the betrayal by Monteagle's servant. He immediately suspected that Tresham {{was responsible for the}} letter, a view which was shared by Thomas Wintour. Together the two confronted the recently recruited conspirator, and threatened to [...] "hang him", but Tresham managed to convince the pair that he had not written the letter, and the next day urged them to abandon the plot.|$|E

[...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was more critical of the series, stating [...] "At first, [...] "Strike Back" [...] seems like a highbrow series on the order of [...] "," [...] but after a few minutes it [...] "conforms to the Skinemax nickname with a graphic sex scene," [...] with [...] "multiple exclamations of the f-word and bloodshed galore." [...] Owen summed [...] "Strike Back shows off high production values and an intense, fast-paced story reminiscent of 24 or Sleeper Cell that occasionally dips into the ridiculous [...] It's too bad the show's graphic nature, especially the bloodshed, is so off-putting as to make the series unwatchable." ...|$|E
