40|$|Classification rules {{regarding}} the dimensioning of CP-mechanism {{has been found}} to be conservative based on experience. This thesis studies the load transmitted into CP-mechanism resulted from ultimate blade failure load (Fex) in heavy ice load condition, mainly focusing on the force on crank pin (Fcrp). Various FE simulations are carried out to investigate the load transmission in CP-mechanism for two hub models. Firstly, a simplification is come up with by using a remote force instead of blade geometry, in order to make the simulations more efficient. Then, initial simulations on the complete hub mechanism are implemented for both models. The results are compared with the results followed the procedure in DNV Classification Notes 51 - 1 and IACS UR I 3. It is found that crank pin force from FE analysis is smaller compared to the result from rules calculation, meaning that the classification rules are conservative. There have been different versions of the application points of ultimate blade failure load and friction coefficient between blade flange, <b>blade</b> <b>carrier</b> bearings and crank disk. In order to achieve a clearer understanding on these factors, further research is implemented by studying three parameters, which are 1) application points of ultimate blade failure load, i. e. spindle arm, 2) geometry gap between blade flange and <b>blade</b> <b>carrier</b> bearings and 3) friction coefficient between blade flange and <b>blade</b> <b>carrier</b> bearings, crank disk and <b>blade</b> <b>carrier</b> bearings. Results show that different forces on crank pin are obtained from FE simulations when applying same spindle arm close to leading edge (LE) or trailing edge (TE). By running simulations of different geometry gaps and friction coefficients between blade flange, <b>blade</b> <b>carrier</b> bearings and crank disk, the purpose is to investigate the friction loss. The result indicates that the geometry gap has slight influence on the force on crank pin and friction coefficient affects the results significantly. Apparently, a bigger friction coefficient will cause more friction loss and smaller force on crank pin. However, the tendency of force on crank pin changing with friction coefficient differs with the relation described in DNV rules. In conclusion, more accurate rules could be suggested based on empirical formulas and FE simulations...|$|E

40|$|Linear accelerators driving Free Electron Lasers (FELs), {{such as the}} Free Electron Laser in Hamburg (FLASH) or the X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL), require {{sophisticated}} Low Level Radio Frequency (LLRF) control systems. The controller of the LLRF {{system should}} stabilize the phase and amplitude of the field in accelerating modules below 0. 02 % of the amplitude and 0. 01 degree for phase tolerances to produce an ultra stable electron beam that meets the required conditions for Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE). Since the LLRF system for the XFEL must be in operation for the next 20 years, it should be reliable, reproducible and upgradeable. Having in mind all requirements of the LLRF control system, the Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture (ATCA) has been chosen to build a prototype of the LLRF system for the FLASH accelerator that is able to supervise 32 cavities of one RF station. The LLRF controller takes advantage of features offered by the ATCA standard. The LLRF system consists of a few ATCA <b>carrier</b> <b>blades,</b> Rear Transition Modules (RTM) and several Advanced Mezzanine Cards (AMCs) that provide all necessary digital and analog hardware components. The distributed hardware of the LLRF system requires a number of communication links that should provide different latencies, bandwidths and protocols.

40|$|Melt {{infiltration}} of preforms prepared by tape casting and lamination {{has been accomplished}} using a short-time infiltration process that significantly suppresses reaction product formation. For layered materials produced via {{infiltration of}} laminated ceramic tapes, of particular interest is the effect that a large change in microstructure has on infiltration, phase formation, and mechanical properties. Hardness of the fine scale composite layers is approximately three times higher than coarse scale layers, due to greater strength of the fine B 4 C network. Fractography showed that crack propagation occurred by brittle fracture of the carbide and ductile extension of the metal. Despite large differences in hardness, the fracture mode of the fine and coarse scale microstructures appears identical. ^ Fluid flow modeling for tape casting was conducted with a Newtonian slurry under a parallel blade, {{and the effect of}} beveling the blade based on a one dimensional flow model is shown. The discussion on slurry deformation after the blade exit suggests that the mode of slurry deformation depends on the relative importance of the pressure gradient and wall shear and that the existence of zero shear plane might {{have a negative effect on}} particle alignment in the tape. The analysis of the flow under a beveled blade predicts that this configuration is more advantageous than the parallel blade for productivity and parallel blade is better for producing uniform particle alignment and thinner tape. Also, the one dimensional flow model for the beveled blade is shown to be a valid approximation of the fluid behavior below a blade angle of 45 degrees. ^ The flow visualization study on tape casting was conducted with a transparent apparatus and model slurry. Most investigators have concluded that the shear stress between the doctor <b>blade</b> and moving <b>carrier</b> causes the particle alignment, but, according to the result of visualization experiment, some degree of particle alignment is already established in the reservoir. ^ The fluid flow concept of tape casting is incorporated with a metal infiltration technique to prepare the ceramic-metal composites with tailored porosity and pore orientation. Boron carbide-aluminum system was used to prepare the composites, and its stiffness constants were investigated. The aligned metal ligaments rarely affect the stiffness constant anisotropy which appears to be caused by tape casting operation. ...|$|R
40|$|The upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) {{scheduled}} for a shut-down period of 2019 - 2020, {{referred to as the}} Phase-I upgrade, will increase the instantaneous luminosity to about three times the design value. Since the current ATLAS trigger system does not allow sufficient increase of the trigger rate, an improvement of the trigger system is required. The Liquid Argon (LAr) Calorimeter read-out will therefore be modified to use digital trigger signals with a higher spatial granularity in order to improve the identification efficiencies of electrons, photons, tau, jets and missing energy, at high background rejection rates at the Level- 1 trigger. The new trigger signals will be arranged in 34000 so-called Super Cells which achieves 5 - 10 times better granularity than the trigger towers currently used and allows an improved background rejection. The readout of the trigger signals will process the signal of the Super Cells at every LHC bunch-crossing at 12 -bit precision and a frequency of 40 MHz. The data will be transmitted to the back-end at 5. 12 Gb/s using a custom serializer and optical converter. ASICs have been developed for ADC, serializer and transmitter for this project and PCB boards are being developed now. In the new back-end system, the received digital data will be processed with a FIR filter, optimal filtering, on a FPGA (Intel-FPGA Arria-X) to identify the bunch crossing and extract the transverse energy with a fixed latency. The results of the digital processing are transferred to the level- 1 trigger system for trigger object reconstruction. The backend system is developed using the ATCA architecture. ATCA <b>carrier</b> <b>blade</b> with RTM will carries four Advanced Mezzanine Cards with the FPGA. In total, the backend system will consist from 31 carrier boards in three ATCA shelfs. In order to verify the full functionality of the new Liquid Argon trigger readout system, a demonstrator set-up has been installed on the ATLAS detector and has been operated in parallel to the regular ATLAS data taking during the LHC Run- 2. We have collected data with 13 TeV proton-proton collisions during the LHC Run- 2, and have observed real pulse from the detector through the demonstrator system. The talk will give an overview of the Phase-I Upgrade of the ATLAS Liquid Argon Calorimeter readout and present the custom developed hardware including their role in real-time data processing and fast data transfer. This contribution will include the performance of the newly developed ASICs including their radiation tolerance and quality assurance, the performance of the prototype boards in the demonstrator system. Results of the system integration test with the final prototypes will be reported...|$|R
