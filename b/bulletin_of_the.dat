5|$|After {{the bombings}} at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, {{a number of}} Manhattan Project {{physicists}} founded the <b>Bulletin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atomic Scientists, which began as an emergency action undertaken by scientists who saw urgent need for an immediate educational program about atomic weapons.

The Baruch Plan, unveiled {{in a speech to the}} newly formed United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC) in June 1946, proposed the establishment of an international atomic development authority, but was not adopted.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, {{the diamond}} {{stingray}} was described twice by three American ichthyologists: as Dasybatus dipterurus by David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert in Proceedings of the United States National Museum, and as Trygon brevis by Samuel Garman in <b>Bulletin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Museum of Comparative Zoology. Jordan and Gilbert's account {{was published in}} May while Garman's was published in October, making dipterurus (feminine dipterura) the correct name as it was published first. However, when Garman synonymized the two in 1913 he inappropriately gave precedence to brevis, leading to long-standing confusion. Both Dasybatus and Trygon were later synonymized with the genus Dasyatis, but many authors still listed D.brevis in place of or in addition to D.dipterura. Garman also synonymized the Hawaiian stingray (D.hawaiensis) with D.dipterura in 1913, which has since been followed by most authors but requires more study for confirmation.|$|E
5|$|Mycena arcangeliana {{was first}} {{described}} by Giacomo Bresadola in 1904; the species was listed along with 41 others found in Pisa, {{in an article}} by Egidio Barsali published in the Bollettino Della Societa Botanica Italiana (<b>Bulletin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Botanical Society of Italy). Authors Roger Phillips and Paul Sterry both describe the name Mycena oortiana as synonymous; M.oortiana was a name given by Frederich Hora in 1960 based on Robert Kühner's 1938 name for the variety Mycena arcangeliana var. oortiana, an invalid name. Phillips had earlier considered M. arcangeliana var. oortiana to be a synonym of M.oortiana, and MycoBank lists it as a synonym of Lucien Quélet's Mycena olivascens. However, Index Fungorum lists both M. olivascens and Kühner's Mycena vitilis var. olivascens as synonyms of M.arcangeliana. The specific epithet arcangeliana may be in honour of Giovanni Arcangeli, who collected the species in the Orto botanico di Pisa. M.arcangeliana {{is commonly known as}} the angel's bonnet, or the late-season bonnet.|$|E
5|$|Two {{major medical}} studies have {{analyzed}} {{the extent of}} casualties from the smog. Leonard Greenburg — the same medical researcher who had previously published findings on the death count of the 1953 and 1963 smogs — published a paper in October 1967 showing that the previous year's smog had likely killed 168 people. Greenburg showed that there were 24 deaths in excess of how many would normally be expected {{at that time of}} year every day, over a period of seven days — using a period four days longer than the smog itself had lasted because of the delay between smog exposure and resultant health effects. Greenburg said that his analysis could not account for damage during the smog that would remain latent and continue to cause disease and death for years. The results of Greenburg's paper were reported by the New York Times. A 1978 medical paper published in the <b>Bulletin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New York Academy of Medicine estimated that the smog shortened the lives of 366 people.|$|E
