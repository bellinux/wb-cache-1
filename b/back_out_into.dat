5|$|U-43 was due {{to depart}} Lorient on a war patrol to an area off Freetown, west Africa, but early on 4 February 1941, she sank while tied to Ysere, an old sailing ship which {{was used as a}} {{floating}} pier. Valves and vents had been tampered-with the previous day, but no one had noticed the slow, but steady ingress of water into the bilges. To make matters worse and contrary to a Befehlshaber der U-Boote (BdU—U-boat command headquarters) directive, a hatch had been left open, allowing water to pour into the after torpedo room. Two petty officers were found to be most at fault; but Lüth, as captain, was ultimately responsible. However, according to author Jordan Vause, no record of punishment seems to have survived and Lüth's career {{does not appear to have}} been affected. U-43 was refloated and Lüth took it <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the North Atlantic in May 1941.|$|E

25|$|A {{large-scale}} attack using anthrax {{would require}} the creation of aerosol particles of 1.5 to 5µm: larger particles would not reach the lower respiratory tract, while smaller particles would be exhaled <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the atmosphere. At this size, conductive powders tend to aggregate because of electrostatic charges, hindering dispersion. So the material must be treated to insulate and neutralize the charges. The weaponized agent must be resistant to degradation by rain and ultraviolet radiation from sunlight, while retaining the ability to efficiently infect the human lung. There are other technological difficulties as well, chiefly relating to storage of the weaponized agent.|$|E
25|$|In 1804, at {{the annual}} meeting of the North West Company in Kaministiquia, Thompson was made a full partner of the company. He spent the next few seasons based there {{managing}} the fur trading operations but still finding time to expand his surveys of the waterways around Lake Superior. At the 1806 company meeting, officers decided to send Thompson <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the interior. Concern over the American-backed expedition of Lewis and Clark prompted the North West Company to charge Thompson with the task of finding a route to the Pacific to open up the lucrative trading territories of the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
25|$|Embedded in the {{thylakoid}} membranes {{are important}} protein complexes which {{carry out the}} light reactions of photosynthesis. Photosystem II and photosystem I contain light-harvesting complexes with chlorophyll and carotenoids that absorb light energy {{and use it to}} energize electrons. Molecules in the thylakoid membrane use the energized electrons to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, decreasing the pH and turning it acidic. ATP synthase is a large protein complex that harnesses the concentration gradient of the hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space to generate ATP energy as the hydrogen ions flow <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the stroma—much like a dam turbine.|$|E

On October 27, Forrest's men attack the Steamboat Belle of St. Louis, Missouri from Fort Randolph. The Belle was on her way upstream from Memphis loaded with cotton bales, heading north to St. Louis. After the boat had landed at Randolph to pick up more payload, she was attacked by Confederate rebels. In the attack, one Union Army Major was killed on the vessel; 26 of the crew, who had gone ashore for freight, were captured by Confederate guerrillas when the captain had the steamboat push <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the river in order to escape and save the boat from capture or destruction. The rebel forces suffered two casualties during the attack.|$|E
25|$|Like mitochondria, chloroplasts use the {{potential}} energy stored in an H+, or hydrogen ion gradient to generate ATP energy. The two photosystems capture light energy to energize electrons taken from water, and release them down an electron transport chain. The molecules between the photosystems harness the electrons' energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, creating a concentration gradient, with more hydrogen ions (up {{to a thousand}} times as many) inside the thylakoid system than in the stroma. The hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space then diffuse back down their concentration gradient, flowing <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the stroma through ATP synthase. ATP synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. Because chloroplast ATP synthase projects out into the stroma, the ATP is synthesized there, in position {{to be used in}} the dark reactions.|$|E
25|$|The book begins {{immediately}} {{following the death of}} Zosima. It is a commonly held perception in the town, and the monastery as well, that true holy men's bodies are incorrupt, i.e., they do not succumb to putrefaction. Thus, the expectation concerning the Elder Zosima is that his deceased body will not decompose. It comes as a great shock to the entire town that Zosima's body not only decays, but begins the process almost {{immediately following}} his death. Within the first day, the smell of Zosima's body is already unbearable. For many this calls into question their previous respect and admiration for Zosima. Alyosha is particularly devastated by the sullying of Zosima's name due to nothing more than the corruption of his dead body. One of Alyosha's companions in the monastery named Rakitin uses Alyosha's vulnerability to set up a meeting between him and Grushenka. However, instead of Alyosha becoming corrupted, he is able to earn fresh faith and hope from Grushenka, while Grushenka's troubled mind begins the path of spiritual redemption through his influence: they become close friends. The book ends with the spiritual regeneration of Alyosha as he embraces, kisses the earth outside the monastery (echoing, perhaps, Zosima's last earthly act before his death) and cries convulsively until finally going <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the world, as Zosima instructed, renewed.|$|E

At 15:00 Rodney joined King George V and they maintained 22 knots – which was nearly maximum speed for Rodney.

500|$|Inspector Lomax then initiates a manhunt for {{the missing}} Carroon. After hiding out on a river barge, Carroon {{encounters}} a little girl, leaving her also unharmed through sheer force of willpower. Then, Carroon proceeds to a nearby pharmacy and kills the chemist, using his now-swollen, crusty, cactus-thorn-riddled hand and arm as a cudgel and leaving a twisted empty husk of the man to be found by police. Quatermass theorizes that Carroon has used select chemicals taken from the shelves to [...] "speed up a change going on inside of him". That night finds Carroon at a zoo, barely visible amongst some shadowed bushes with far less of his human form remaining. In the morning, twisted corpses of zoo animals are found, their life forces having all been absorbed, and a trail of slime leading <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the community. Among the bushes, Quatermass and Briscoe also find a small but living remnant {{of what was once}} Victor Carroon, and take it back to their laboratory. From his examination of this remnant, Quatermass concludes that some kind of alien life has completely taken over and will eventually release reproduction spores, endangering the entire planet ...|$|E
50|$|This type of milking {{facility}} {{was the first}} development, after open-paddock milking, for many farmers. The building was a long, narrow, lean-to shed that was open along one long side. The cows were held in a yard at the open side {{and when they were}} about to be milked they were positioned in one of the bails (stalls). Usually the cows were restrained in the bail with a breech chain and a rope to restrain the outer back leg. The cow could not move about excessively and the milker could expect not to be kicked or trampled while sitting on a (three-legged) stool and milking into a bucket. When each cow was finished she <b>backed</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the yard again. The UK bail, initially developed by Wiltshire dairy farmer Arthur Hosier, was a six standing mobile shed with steps that the cow mounted, so the herdsman didn't have to bend so low. The milking equipment was much as today, a vacuum from a pump, pulsators, a claw-piece with pipes leading to the four shells and liners that stimulate and suck the milk from the teat. The milk went into churns, via a cooler.|$|R

Despite Mandy's warnings about the robot-like Smilers and their monk-like Winders that maintain order on the ship, Amy investigates a tented area around the hole. A tentacle-like entity emerges, and she <b>backs</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> a group of Winders. They take her to one of many voting booths {{set up on the}} ship. She is shown a video about the truth of Starship UK, and then asked if she wants to [...] "protest" [...] the truth or [...] "accept" [...] it, the latter causing her short-term memory to be wiped. Amy chooses to accept, and creates a video to herself to prevent the Doctor from learning the truth, before the mind wipe. By then, Mandy had led the Doctor to the booth as Amy finishes watching the video to herself. The Doctor is curious as what [...] "protest" [...] will cause and activates it, sending he and Amy into the maw of a giant creature below the ship. The Doctor induces the creature to vomit, allowing them to escape back to the ship, where Liz 10 and Mandy helps them avoid the Smilers and Winders after them. As they flee, Liz 10 explains she is Queen Elizabeth X, the ruler of the ship.|$|R
500|$|Investigators {{identified}} {{evidence of}} arcing in wiring of the {{in-flight entertainment system}} network, but this did not trip the circuit breakers. [...] The investigation was unable to confirm if this arc was the [...] "lead event" [...] that ignited the flammable covering on MPET insulation blankets that quickly spread across other flammable materials. The crew did not recognize that a fire had started and were not warned by instruments. Once they {{became aware of the}} fire, the uncertainty of the problem made it difficult to address. The rapid spread of the fire led to the failure of key display systems, and the crew were soon rendered unable to control the aircraft. Because he had no light by which to see his controls after the displays failed, the pilot was forced to steer the plane blindly; intentionally or not, the plane swerved off course and headed <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the Atlantic. Recovered fragments of the plane show that the heat inside the cockpit became so great that the ceiling started to melt. The recovered standby attitude indicator and airspeed indicators showed that the aircraft struck the water at 300 knots (560km/h, 348mph) in a 20 degrees nose down and 110-degree bank attitude, or almost inverted; the impact force of the aircraft crashing into the Atlantic Ocean was later calculated to be 350 times the force of gravity ("g"s). Death was instantaneous for all passengers and crew due to the impact forces and deceleration.|$|E

[...] "Ian Smith made accepting the deal worse by acting like a gentleman," [...] the American later said. Vorster opened the discussion by announcing that he had applied no pressure to the Rhodesian delegates, which caused further consternation amongst the Rhodesians which they had difficulty suppressing. It was agreed that the Rhodesians should return to Salisbury and consult their cabinet, then announce their answer. Despite expressing [...] "incredulity" [...] at {{what had happened in}} Pretoria, and showing deep reluctance, the politicians in Salisbury resolved that despite what they perceived as [...] "South African treachery" [...] the responsible course of action could only be to go on with the peace process, and that meant accepting Kissinger's terms, which they agreed were better than any they could get in the future should they refuse. Smith announced his government's answer on the evening of 24 September 1976: [...] "Yes." [...] South Africa's wavering financial and military assistance suddenly became available again, but the Frontline States then abruptly changed tact and turned the Kissinger terms down, saying that any interim period before majority rule was unacceptable. A new constitutional conference in Geneva, Switzerland was hastily organised by Britain to try to salvage something from the wreckage, with 20 October 1976 set as the start date.|$|E

At the upper side of a little bay I paddled close up to shore, and waited till he ran round, almost up to me, before <b>backing</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> deep water. Splashing seemed to madden the brute, so I splashed him, till in his fury he waded out deeper and deeper, to strike the exasperating canoe with his antlers. When he would follow no further, I swung the canoe suddenly, and headed for the opening at a racing stroke. I had a fair start before he understood the trick; but I never turned to see how he made the bank and circled the little bay. The splash and plunge of hoofs was fearfully close behind me as the canoe shot through the opening; and as the little bark swung round on the open waters of the lake, for a final splash and flourish of the paddle, and a yell or two of derision, there stood the bull in the inlet, still thrashing his antlers and gritting his teeth; and there I left him.|$|R

2500|$|The Endeavour Segment, {{an active}} rift {{zone of the}} larger Juan de Fuca Ridge on the British Columbia Coast, {{contains}} a group of active black smokers called the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents, located [...] southwest of Vancouver Island. This group of hydrothermal vents lies [...] below sea level and consists of five hydrothermal fields, known as Sasquatch, Saily Dawg, High Rise, Mothra, and Main Endeavour. Like typical hydrothermal vents, the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents form when cold seawater seeps into cracks and crevices in the Endeavour Segment where it becomes heated by magma that lies beneath the seafloor. As the water is heated, it rises and seeks a path <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the Pacific Ocean through openings in the Endeavour Segment, forming hydrothermal vents. These hydrothermal vents release fluids with temperatures of over 300°C and have been a focus of research by Canadian and international scientists. The manned United States Navy deep-ocean research submersible DSV Alvin and the remotely operated underwater vehicle Jason have done work at the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents. Joint Canada-United States studies have made use of the Canadian Remotely Operated Platform for Ocean Sciences.
