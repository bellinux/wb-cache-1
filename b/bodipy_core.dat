50|$|BODIPY, {{abbreviation}} for boron-dipyrromethene, is {{a class of}} fluorescent dyes. It is composed of dipyrromethene complexed with a disubstituted boron atom, typically a BF2 unit. The IUPAC name for the <b>BODIPY</b> <b>core</b> is 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene. Due to instability of the required unsubstituted dipyrromethene precursor, the unsubstituted BODIPY dye had not been prepared until 2009. Three independent groups reported different syntheses of the title compound.|$|E

The presence of a five membered aromatic heterocycle {{in place of a}} six membered aryl group at the meso-position significantly alters the electronic properties of 3 -pyrrolyl BODIPY as reflected in their spectral, photophysical and electrochemical properties. The X-ray structure solved for meso-furyl 3 -pyrrolyl BODIPY showed that the appended pyrrole is more deviated from the mean plane of the <b>BODIPY</b> <b>core</b> compared to meso-aryl 3 -pyrrolyl BODIPY. However, the structure also revealed that the meso-furyl group is more in plane with the <b>BODIPY</b> <b>core</b> and participates in p-delocalization unlike meso-aryl 3 -pyrrolyl BODIPY in which the meso-aryl group is almost in perpendicular orientation with the <b>BODIPY</b> <b>core.</b> The absorption studies indicated that the meso-heterocyclic 3 -pyrrolyl BODIPYs showed bathochromic shifts with maximum shifts noted for mesofuryl 3 -pyrrolyl BODIPY compared to meso-aryl BODIPY.

40|$|In {{a highly}} {{interdisciplinary}} field, such as organic photovoltaics (OPVs), developing a predictive {{understanding of the}} relationship between molecular structures, morphology of the photoactive layer and the ultimate device performance is the key to unlocking the vast potential of this field. Although isolated examples of high-performance organic molecules are prevalent in the literature, the reasons for their superior performance are not well understood. The function of an OPV device is dependent of four key processes: (i) light absorption, (ii) charge separation, (iii) charge transport, and (iv) charge collection. While the first three are material-dependent factors, charge collection depends {{on the nature of the}} interfaces involved. We have thus investigated a new class of semiconductor molecules based on BODIPY dyes with the aim of understanding how variations in the molecular structure affect the optoelectronic and transport properties of the molecules. ^ First-generation pi-conjugated polymers based on the <b>BODIPY</b> <b>core</b> possess broad and intense absorption spectra. Additionally, the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels of the polymers can be tuned by a judicious choice of the comonomers. Electron-deficient comonomers with electron affinities higher than that of the <b>BODIPY</b> <b>core,</b> predominantly afford n-type polymers. A unique feature of these semiconductors is their panchromatic absorption spectrum that spans throughout the visible region. Thus these polymers can be considered to be potential electron acceptors in all-polymer solar cells. ^ Copolymerization of BODIPY with electron-rich comonomers, on the other hand, only results in p-type semiconductors. Furthermore, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of these polymers is found to correlate with the ionization potential of the electron-rich monomer. Having said that, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level does not change. Thus for the first time, a correlation between theoretical calculations and experimental observations has been demonstrated for predicting the FMO energy levels of BODIPY-based semiconducting polymers. ^ Second-generation copolymers based on an unsubstituted <b>BODIPY</b> <b>core</b> retain the broad absorption characteristics of the first-generation polymers. In addition, due to reduced electron density on the <b>BODIPY</b> <b>core,</b> the HOMO energy level of the resulting polymers is reduced thereby imparting enhanced oxidative stability to these polymers. Charge transport measurements through thick films (∼ 1 micron) reveal only p-channel activity with hole mobilities comparable to some of the high-performance polymers reported in literature. Preliminary bulk-heterojunction OPV devices fabricated with these polymers show modest power conversion efficiencies. We believe that understanding the morphology of the active layer in relation to the polymer structure will help improve future molecular designs and eventually, device performance. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} novel donor–acceptor type borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) -tethered triphenylamine conjugates (BDP 4 – 8) {{containing}} {{one or two}} <b>BODIPY</b> <b>cores</b> attached to a triphenylamine scaffold at the 4 - or 4, 40 - positions were successfully synthesised via a mild and effective protocol. Their photophysical and electrochemical properties were investigated. The absorption spectra indicated that the meso-substituted BODIPY with triphenylamine did not give rise to an intense intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and did not effectively extend the conjugated length comparedwith substitution at the 2, 6 - and 3, 5 -positions as previously reported. It is worth noticing that the asymmetric mono-BODIPY-tethered triphenylamine conjugates (BDP 5, BDP 7) showed an electronic distribution imbalance due to the special 3 D propeller shape of triphenylamine resulting in twisted molecular space configurations. In contrast, the symmetric bis-BODIPY-tethered triphenylamine conjugates (BDP 4, BDP 6, and BDP 8) exhibited a balanced electronic distribution. The photoluminescence spectra of these conjugates exhibited significant Stokes shifts (5300 – 6700 cm 1), which caused fluorescence emission spectra in near-infrared regions. Cyclic voltammograms reveal that the asymmetric mono-BODIPY-tethered triphenylamine conjugates (BDP 5, BDP 7) have higher LUMO energy levels and lower HOMO energy levels, thus resulting in larger bandgaps than the bis-BODIPY-tethered triphenylamine ones...|$|R

40|$|Our {{group has}} {{developed}} different nanomachines over the years, {{while some of}} them are designed to perform in solution phase, a group of molecules termed nanocars were designed to specifically operate on solid surfaces. In this work, wheels, designed to yield better surface and molecule interaction for our studies is synthesized. In the past we have used mainly C 60 fullerene wheels for our nanocars molecules. But after we decided to integrate a light activated motor into the nanocars, the fullerene wheels had to be phased out since the fullerene is known to quench the light energy used to actuate the motor. Our group then primarily utilized the p-carborane wheel as it does not show the same quenching effect with the motors. To improve the mobility and diffusion constant of the nanocars, a new generation of wheels was developed, featuring adamantane. A four-wheeled and a three-wheeled fluorescent nanocar was synthesized and monitored, showing enhanced performance to the p-carborane wheeled analogue, which we attribute to the lower surface/wheel interactions. The adamantane wheels were then used to synthesize two nanocars with both a fluorescent 4, 4 -difluoro- 4 -bora- 3 a, 4 a-diaza-s-indacene (<b>BODIPY)</b> <b>core</b> and a MHz frequency light-activated unidirectional rotary motor, one molecule that is angular and expected to operate in circles and one that is straight and expected to primarily move in a single direction. Preliminary experiments have been conducted and show promising results. While the <b>BODIPY</b> <b>core</b> does quench some of the energy {{that was supposed to be}} directed to the motor, the motor still accelerates the nanocar to increase the diffusion constant. The same principle was used to synthesize a molecule with <b>BODIPY</b> <b>core</b> and motor (but without wheels) that could operate in solution. Finally, a two-wheeled nanocar was synthesized with a water soluble extension that could fit into cyclodextrin (CD) cavities and serve as wheels. This nanocar is expected to have very high surface interaction and could be used as to modify surface interactions and the resulting mobility and diffusion constants of nanocars on surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a {{therapeutic}} strategy that utilises {{the administration of}} a photosensitiser along with light irradiation to generate reactive singlet oxygen that destruct pathological lesions. However, the current clinically approved photosensitisers {{for the treatment of}} cancer present several limitations such as a lack in ideal photophysical and photochemical properties, poor solubility and adverse effects i. e. prolonged photosensitisation or pain following PDT. Therefore, it is necessary to discover and develop new classes of photosensitiser with more ideal properties. From our earlier data, we had shown that 151 -hydroxypurpurin- 7 -lactone dimethyl ester (G 2), a semisynthetic cyclic-tetrapyrrole, was a potent photosensitiser. In this study, aspartyl and lysyl amino acids conjugated G 2 analogues were prepared and evaluated with the aim to further improve its PDT efficacies. Also included in this study, were two series of non-tetrapyrrolic photosensitisers: boron difluoride dipyrromethene (BODIPY) and rosamine photosensitisers. Both classes of compounds have many characteristics of an ideal photosensitiser and their syntheses are relatively easy to perform and scale-up. For the G 2 analogues, results from the study indicated that conjugation of aspartyl or lysyl amino acids was able to modify its properties including light absorption coefficient, singlet oxygen quantum yield, cellular uptake and intracellular localisation. Both conjugations were able to improve the aqueous solubility but resulted in reduced in vitro PDT potency. Further evaluation showed that G 2 -aspartyl (G 2 -Asp) was able to achieve similar potency compared to G 2 in terms of vasculature occlusion efficiency in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model and tumour growth inhibition in a syngeneic mouse model. Meanwhile for the BODIPYs, in vitro data indicated that <b>BODIPY</b> with iodinated <b>core</b> exhibited potent photo-induced cytotoxicity at sub-micromolar IC 50 concentrations. Further studies on a lead BODIPY showed exclusive mitochondria localisation, induction of G 2 /M-phase cell cycle block and onset of apoptosis. The BODIPY molecules also extensively occluded the vasculature of the CAM model. Conversely for the rosamines, they were found to be minimally photoactive, even though several of the derivatives exhibited potent cytotoxicity (average IC 50 < 0. 5 μM) which was found to be associated with their ability to compromise mitochondrial membrane potential and to inhibit the oxidative phosphorylation complexes primarily the ATP synthase. Preliminary in vivo studies on 4 T 1 murine breast cancer-bearing female BALB/c mice indicated that treatment with a lead rosamine in a single dosing of 5 mg/kg or a scheduled dosing of 3 mg/kg once every two day for six times (q 2 d× 6) exhibited only minimal tumour growth delay. In conclusion, G 2 -Asp given its hydrophilic nature, is a pharmaceutically advantageous candidate to be developed into a clinical photosensitiser as it can be formulated easily for administration. Meanwhile for the non-tetrapyrrolic photosensitisers, BODIPY with an iodinated core structure may have potential as new PDT agents for cancer, while the rosamine analogues may be further developed as mitochondrial targeting agents that either directly kill or deliver cytotoxic drugs to selectively kill cancer cells...|$|R

The spectra display the narrow absorption and fluorescence emission bands and the generally quite small Stokes shifts characteristic of classic difluoroboron dipyrrins.
