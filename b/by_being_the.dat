5|$|After {{being traded}} {{down to the}} American Hockey League (AHL) in 1945, Dion {{continued}} to play professional hockey for nearly a decade, primarily with the Buffalo Bisons, and earned the Harry Hap Holmes Memorial Award in 1950 <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> goaltender with the lowest goals against average in the league.

5|$|As {{the club}} gained success in European club tournaments in the 1980s and 1990s, and {{thousands}} of IFK fans travelled to Hamburg, Barcelona, Dundee, Milan, Manchester and Munich, the supporters gained influence on the club, for example by lending money to the almost bankrupt IFK Göteborg so the team could go to Valencia to play the quarter-final in the UEFA Cup in 1982, or <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> main force behind the move back to Gamla Ullevi in 1992. The early 1990s saw a downward trend in attendance numbers, even though the club was successful on the pitch, but the trend turned in the later years of the decade and {{the first few years}} of the new millennium brought the club's highest average attendance since the early 1980s.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, most of Mayfair {{was built}} on with prestigious housing to suit the upper class; unlike some nearby areas of London, it has never lost its {{affluent}} status. The decline of the British aristocracy in the early 20th century led to Mayfair becoming more commercial instead of residential, with many former homes converted into offices for major corporate headquarters, embassies and other businesses. There remains a substantial quantity of luxury residential property, upmarket shops and restaurants, and modern hotels along Piccadilly and Park Lane in particular. Mayfair's prestigious status has been commemorated <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> most expensive property square on the London Monopoly board.|$|E

5|$|Navigator {{training}} was historically interwoven with culture and ritual.

5|$|During the close-season, Johnson {{sought a}} {{possible}} new club back in England, {{and before the}} start of the 2010 season in America, he was given a trial with Major League Soccer side Seattle Sounders FC joining them for their pre-season training camp. Having trained with Sounders, Johnson decided to stay with Austin Aztex and signed a new two-year contract. In the first game of the Aztex season, Johnson hit the goalpost with a 20-yard curling shot, but Lawrence Olum scored with the rebound, helping the Aztex to a 2–0 victory against Montreal Impact. During May, Johnson scored five goals, including two in a 3–3 draw with Tampa Bay and made two assists to help Austin record an unbeaten spell. He again scored two goals in a 2–1 Aztex victory over Miami and helped take his team to the top of the table <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> club's leading goalscorer throughout the campaign. Heath also used him in his original position in attack, including as a sole striker in a defeat to Puerto Rico Islanders. It was a result that saw the Aztex lose their top spot for the first time in three months. A week later, Johnson scored his tenth goal of the season to give his side their fourth win in five games by defeating Carolina RailHawks 3–2. The Aztex returned to the top of the table with a 2–0 victory against NSC Minnesota Stars with Johnson scoring the opening goal of the game. Aztex qualified for the end-of-season play-offs where they faced Montreal Impact over two legs. Johnson scored one of Aztex's two goals in the second leg but their season finished with a 5–2 aggregate defeat. Johnson played a total of 28 games during the season, scoring 15 goals, and earned a place in the 2010 season best XI.|$|E

5|$|Offscreen, Robert Mitchum's {{arrest and}} {{conviction}} for marijuana possession—he would serve {{two months in}} jail—was widely assumed to mean career death for RKO's most promising young star, but Hughes surprised the industry by announcing that his contract was not endangered. Of much broader significance, Hughes decided to get the jump on his Big Five competitors <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> first to settle the federal government's antitrust suit against the major studios, which had won a crucial Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. Under the consent decree he signed, Hughes agreed to dissolve the old parent company, Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corp., and split RKO's production-distribution business and its exhibition chain into two entirely separate corporations—RKO Pictures Corp. and RKO Theatres Corp.—with the obligation to promptly sell off one or the other. While Hughes delayed the divorcement procedure until December 1950 and didn't actually sell his stock in the theater company for another three years, his decision to acquiesce {{was one of the}} crucial steps in the collapse of classical Hollywood's studio system.|$|E

5|$|Salma El-Said and Sherine El-Zeiny {{qualified}} for the Olympics as the second and third-ranked Africans at the 2011 World Championships, with El-Zeiny having been offered a spot after the highest-placed African, Nicole Szabo of South Africa, turned down the invitation due to injury. El-Said had taken a break from active competition while recovering from an injury of her own and came back shortly before the World Championships. Since then she had taken the individual all-around title at the 2011 Arab Games and the 2012 African Championships. El-Zeiny was {{a veteran of the}} 2008 tournament and both had been a part of Egypt's victorious all-around team at the 2012 African Championships. In London, El-Said's best event was the balance beam, in which she placed 42nd. She was also 63rd in the uneven bars, 69th in the floor exercise, and was ranked 41st overall in the individual all-around. El-Zeiny was 53rd on the balance beam, but finished 82nd and last in the floor exercise after suffering an injury. Yasmine Rostom, the rhythmic gymnast, qualified <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> top performer from Africa at the 2011 World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships.

5|$|Super Smash Bros. Brawl, which Project M modifies, is a {{fighting}} game with an unconventional battle system. Players battle in arenas of varying sizes {{and levels of}} complexity, controlling characters {{with a variety of}} play styles. They can attack one another with their own repertoires of special moves, or with a basic attack. Attacks can be avoided by jumping or using a short-lived shield move. Unlike most fighting games, Brawl does not include standard health gauges, but a percentage counter; there is no point at which a character is automatically knocked out from the counter getting too high, but they will be knocked farther with increasing damage. Being knocked off the screen—or falling off oneself—causes a knock-out. Players may use items for offensive purposes, such as guns and swords, or for healing purposes, such as food and heart containers. The stages, characters, and items are drawn from Nintendo's video game franchises such as Mario, Pokémon, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid, along with Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series and Konami's Metal Gear series. The victor of a match has no standard determining factor. Rather, depending on the settings, victory may be reached, for example, <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> last player alive using a stock system, or by achieving the most KOs after a set amount of time.|$|E

The infantrymen were disarmed by the Americans. So, they journeyed to be commissioned {{in the regular}} Filipino army.

The sharpshooters became famous for their fierce fighting and proved their worth <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> usual spearheading unit in every major battle in the Philippine-American War. After the Battle of Calumpit on 25–27 April 1899, only seven or eight of them remained in the regular Filipino army.
