2500|$|Yes: <b>But</b> <b>What</b> <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> Mean?, Thomas Mosbø, Milton, a Wyndstar Book, 1994 ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{integral}} of {{a function}} [...] between limits [...] and [...] {{can be interpreted}} as the area under the graph of [...] This is easy to understand for familiar functions such as polynomials, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> mean for more exotic functions? In general, for which class of functions does [...] "area under the curve" [...] make sense? The answer to this question has great theoretical and practical importance.|$|E
2500|$|As {{various other}} critics do, Michael Coveney is still asking: [...] "Yes, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> all mean? Kenneth Tynan railed against the 'gratuitous obscurity' of Harold Pinter's poetic 1975 play {{when it was}} first {{produced}} by Peter Hall at the National starring John Gielgud as the supplicant versifier Spooner and Ralph Richardson as his host Hirst, patron and supporter of the arts. But the play is always gloriously enjoyable as an off-kilter vaudeville of friendship and dependency." [...] In The Guardian, Billington concludes that [...] "This is a compelling revival much aided by Neil Austin's lighting and Adam Cork's subliminal sound," [...] observing: [...] "when audience and cast finally joined in applauding Pinter, [...] seated in a box, I felt it was in recognition of an eerily disturbing play that transports us into a world somewhere between reality and dream." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> matter? There {{was plenty}} of wire, and the wind had not much chance to blow it about, as it was {{protected}} by the neighboring treetops.|$|R
60|$|Gyp {{could feel}} his wicked old smile even before she raised herself. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> matter if he did guess? She knew he would keep a stable secret.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, love! I don't {{believe in}} love. I suppose I thought I loved once, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> come to after all? Now, there's Mr Eames--we all know he's in love." ...|$|R
2500|$|Subjectivity is {{that which}} the individual—and no one else—has. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> mean to have {{something}} like this? It cannot be understood {{in the same way}} as having a car or a bank account. It means to be someone who is becoming someone—it means being a person with a past, a present, and a future. No one can have an individual's past, present or future. Different people experience these in various ways—these experiences are unique, not anyone else's. Having a past, present, and future means that a person is an existing individual—that a person can find meaning in time and by existing. Individuals do not think themselves into existence, they are born. But once born and past a certain age, the individual begins to make choices in life; now those choices can be his, his parents', society’s, etc. The important point is that to exist, the individual must make choices—the individual must decide what to do the next moment and on into the future. What the individual chooses and how he chooses will define who and what he is—to himself and to others. Kierkegaard put it this way in Works of Love, 1847: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{it were a}} {{question}} between you and another gentleman one might comprehend. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> mean, between you and nothing?" ...|$|E
60|$|DORA. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> mean then? That is {{just what}} we couldn't understand, when you were telling us about not sacrificing ourselves, yesterday.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> when <b>it</b> got there, we {{must leave}} to another chapter.|$|R
60|$|Su-Su smiled, and {{her eyes}} were yet softer. Again she felt the soft hands at her throat. He was good to look upon, and the belt was indeed small, made for a smaller man; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> matter? She could make many belts.|$|R
6000|$|... "There are children--five of them; {{the prettiest}} little dears one ever saw. The eldest {{is just about}} thirteen." [...] This was a fib, because Mrs. Carroll knew that the eldest boy was sixteen; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> signify? [...] "Amelia is so warmly {{attached}} to them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Civil! <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> matter! Let them eat {{and drink}} what they please, {{as long as the}} food lasts. I don't suppose the butcher will send you more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He doesn't mind," [...] she replied. [...] "Let {{that stuff}} {{alone for a}} time. I {{want to look at}} you. You're fine, Dick, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> all mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I am ill;--sometimes very ill; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> matter? I did {{not send}} for you, Frank, {{to speak of}} aught so trivial as that. I have a favour to ask." ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Rowley {{took her}} candle {{and went to}} bed, professing to herself {{that she could not}} {{understand}} <b>it.</b> <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> signify? It was, at any rate, certain now that the man had put himself out of Nora's reach, and if he chose to marry a republican virago, with a red nose, it could now make no difference to Nora. Lady Rowley almost felt a touch of satisfaction in reflecting on the future misery of his married life.|$|R
60|$|He came. But {{why did he}} come? She {{looked at}} him for a sign. He gave no sign. He did not even kiss her. He behaved as if he were an affable, usual acquaintance. This was superficial, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> hide? She waited for him, she wanted him to make some sign.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> matter? If it {{was written}} in the book that she should become Madame Lacordaire, of course the world would know that there must have been some preparatory love-making. Let them have their laugh; a good husband would not be dearly {{purchased}} at so trifling an expense. And so they sallied forth with already half the ceremony of a wedding.|$|R
6000|$|... "In this country," [...] he said, leaning back, [...] "we are {{spared the}} barbarity of table d'hôte dinners. Therefore we must wait, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> matter? There is always {{something}} to talk about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a mistake," [...] said Patsy, quite bewildered. Then {{she read}} her name upon the wrapper, quite plainly written, {{and shook her}} head. [...] "It's for me, all right. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Three. Three of that lot,--though a goodish {{many have}} come up since. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> amount to? When I have {{anything}} that is very good, some fellow that I like gets him from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was Miss Millpond, {{smooth as}} summer's sea, [...] That usual paragon, an only daughter, [...] Who seem'd {{the cream of}} equanimity [...] Till skimm'd--and then there was some milk and water, [...] With a slight shade of blue too, it might be, [...] Beneath the surface; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> matter? [...] Love 's riotous, but {{marriage}} should have quiet, [...] And being consumptive, live on a milk diet.|$|R

60|$|There {{must have}} been {{something}} juvenile or timid in her own epistle, as one ostensibly coming from a man, she declared to herself; for Trewe quite adopted the tone of an elder and superior in this reply. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> matter? he had replied; he had written to her with his own hand from that very room she knew so well, for he was now back again in his quarters.|$|R
60|$|CAPTAIN SHOTOVER. An adventurous life; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> end in? Respectability. A ladylike daughter. The {{language}} and {{appearance of a}} city missionary. Let it be a warning {{to all of you}} [he goes out through the garden].|$|E
6000|$|... "Come now," [...] she said, with {{a little}} nervous laugh, [...] "he's not so bad as all that. You don't know him. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> matter now, as long as we're {{not going to see}} them any more?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{they would}} have thought that we were {{stealing}} them, old fellow. Also those Mountaineers were superstitious, and I did not want them to desert. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> matter, anyway? If you had, {{they would have}} been burned in the palace." ...|$|E
60|$|Already {{it was a}} history. In every phase she was so different. Yet she {{was always}} Ursula Brangwen. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> mean, Ursula Brangwen? She <b>did</b> not know <b>what</b> she was. Only she was full of rejection, of refusal. Always, always she was {{spitting}} {{out of her mouth}} the ash and grit of disillusion, of falsity. She could only stiffen in rejection, in rejection. She seemed always negative in her action.|$|R
6000|$|It was the point-blank {{question}} she had dreaded. She {{looked straight at}} him, and answered: [...] "No." [...] She had burnt her boats; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> matter, if she got him? He would forgive her. And throwing her arms round his neck, she {{kissed him on the}} lips. She was winning! She felt it in the beating of his heart against her, in the closing of his eyes. [...] "I want to make sure! I want to make sure!" [...] she whispered. [...] "Promise!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Alas for my expectations! When at {{last the}} time came it was a charming picture indeed upon which I looked, but how different! A group of girls in short skirts and picturesque peasant attire moving lightly about the stage and singing; a man in uniform making passionate love to one of them, who was coyly motioning him away with her hand and bidding him stay with her eyes. A pretty picture it all made and a {{dazzling}} one. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> all mean? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sixty-two if I live another week, and I {{have never}} yet had any home but Castle Richmond. There I was born, and till {{the other day}} I {{had every reason to}} trust that there I might die. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> matter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{laughed at}} her question. [...] "Oh I perhaps don't mean as virtuous as THAT! Your idea {{is that it can}} be virtuous--in any sense worthy of the name--only if she's NOT free? <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> become then," [...] he asked, [...] "for HER?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I did {{not notice}} the dress particularly,' Mr. Singleton said, 'but it was {{certainly}} a blue of some sort. Of course it is quite {{out of the question}} that you could have done all these things unconsciously; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> all mean? I am absolutely bewildered.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no but," [...] he said, {{getting more}} and more excited. [...] "See how simple it is. Edith Crawford wears the {{diamonds}} one night, then she brings them back to Lady Donaldson's room. Remember the maid's statement: 'My lady said: [...] "Have you put them back, my dear?"--a simple statement, utterly ignored by the prosecution. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> mean? That Lady Donaldson could not see for herself whether Edith Crawford had put back the jewels or not, since she asked the question." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, {{satisfied}} and shattered, fulfilled and destroyed, {{he went home}} away from her, drifting vaguely through the darkness, lapsed into the old fire of burning passion. Far away, far away, {{there seemed to be}} a small lament in the darkness. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> matter? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> matter, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> anything matter save this ultimate and triumphant experience of physical passion, that had blazed up anew like a new spell of life. 'I was becoming quite dead-alive, nothing but a word-bag,' he said in triumph, scorning his other self. Yet somewhere far off and small, the other hovered.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then, mamma, {{you must}} have told him yourself, and I don't think you knew till just before you were going. <b>But,</b> mamma, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> matter? He has been here, and I have told him--' ...|$|R
