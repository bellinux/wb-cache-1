More precisely, we seek to find the transmit beamformer to minimize the error probability of the legitimate receivers while maintaining a high (close to one) error probability for the eavesdroppers. To reach this goal, we exploit the popular "artificial noise" strategy which allows to confuse the eavesdroppers while the legitimate receivers are not affected. Under the low noise regime assumption for the eavesdroppers, we first derive the <b>balancing</b> <b>coefficient</b> to reach the constraint of high error probability for the eavesdroppers.

The third section of Table  6 and Fig.  5 describes the result of total and monthly effects in terms of the coefficients. The total payment significantly declines with an increase in PR, but the total payment effect to FFL and the total spending effect are not significant in this offer. The only significant effect for ΔDebt is ΔCCC balance for FFL. It declines $ 101.83 if FFL increases by 1 percent. This indicates that most of the consumers borrow less if interest rates are higher regardless of FFL or PR offers. The interesting result here is that the signs of ΔCCC <b>balance</b> <b>coefficients</b> and ΔPB <b>balance</b> <b>coefficients</b> are opposite with the signs of ΔEFX <b>balance</b> <b>coefficients,</b> which tells that consumers will borrow more money from other banks if interest rates of offer in examined bank are increased.|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{calculation}} and comparison indications of {{the condition of the}} prooxidant-antioxidant system (PAS) of strains of Basidiomycetes under periodic surface cultivation on a glucose-peptone medium. The research material consisted of the mycelium and culture filtrate (CF) from 57 strains, 52 of them belonging to 7 species of the order Agaricales and 5 belonging to 5 species of the order Polyporales. The intensity of the processes of lipid peroxidation was determined by a modified spectrophotometric method for contents of active products to thiobarbituric acid. Total antioxidant activity (АОА) of the mycological material was evaluated by intensity of inhibition from accumulated products of lipid peroxide oxidation (LPO) in a model reaction of oxidation by Twin- 80 oxygen of the air. From the data obtained, indicators of prooxidant activity (POA), indicators of reserve of substrate peroxidation (SPO) and the <b>balance</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the prooxidant-antioxidant system (CbPАS) were calculated. It was established that strains of Basidiomycetes are characterized by significant predominance of prooxidant activity characteristic of PAS in the culture filtrate in comparison with the mycelium indicator. The highest values of POA in the Culture Filtrate were observed on the 12 -th day of cultivation for the strain Р- 089 genus Pleurotus and strain Gl- 2 genus Ganoderma, and for the mycelium on the 9 -th day of cultivation for the strains Р-сіtr, Р- 089, Р-er and Р- 082 of the genus Pleurotus. There is a direct dependence between the indicators of POA in the CF and mycelium for each strain, this dependence and level of indication do not reflect their systematic placement. We distinguished a more significant prevalence of indicators of reserve of substrates peroxidation of mycelium for most strains, than for such indicators with CF The highest value of reserve SPO of mycelium was recorded for strains Р- 447, Р- 998, Р- 039, Р- 94, Р- 2175, Р-сіtr, Р-er, D- 140 of the genus Pleurotus and strains F- 107, F- 610 of the genus Flammulina.

40|$|Species of {{interest}} (or simply species) are {{chosen by the}} user to represent the possible species in a chemical system. Basis species combine linearly {{to make up the}} species {{of interest}}. Basis species are analogous to thermodynamic components in that they are the minimum number to describe the compositional variation, but unlike components basis species can be charged. The calculations of chemical equilibrium in CHNOSZ are formulated for a system that is open with re-spect to the basis species. Therefore, the natural variables are temperature, pressure and chemical potentials of the basis species. To calculate the equilibrium distribution of species in a given system, a single linear balancing constraint must be specified. Therefore, we say things like “the reactions are balanced on CO 2 ” or “the reactions are balanced on protein length”. The <b>balancing</b> <b>coefficients</b> describe these constraints. At different times in the documentation of CHNOSZ, the balancing constraint has been associated with the conserved component, immobile component, or conserved basis species, all with the same meaning. The “reactions ” in the preceding statements refer to transformations between species. The actual calcula-tions, however, start with the definitions of the formation reactions. The formation reaction for any species has one mole of the species as a product, and the mass balance is made up of the basis species. By definition, the formation reaction is written to form one mole of a species. For many systems, the extent of the molar formula of the species {{is not a matter of}} concern. However, for systems made of poly-mers, such as proteins, it is often desirable to normalize the molar formula by the <b>balancing</b> <b>coefficients.</b> This normalization has been referred to previously as using the residue equivalents of proteins [2]; here the terminology of normalizewill be used preferentially 1. Two differentmethods of calculating the equilibrium activities of species in a system are described below. These are referred to as the reaction-matrix approach and the Boltzmann distribution. Each method is illustrated using specific example that has been described previously [2, 3] (the “CSG ” example). The example system demonstrates that two approaches are equivalent when the molar formluas are normalized. 2 Standar...|$|R
