5|$|Millet cultivation: The {{discovery}} in northern China of domesticated varieties of <b>broomcorn</b> and foxtail millet from 8500 BC, or earlier, suggests that millet cultivation might have predated that of rice {{in parts of}} Asia. Clear evidence of millet began to cultivate by 6500 BC at sites of Cishan, Peiligang and Jiahu. Archaeological remains from Cishan sum up to over 300 storage pits, 80 with millet remains, with a total millet storage capacity estimated for the site of about 100,000kg of grain. By 4000 BC, most Yangshao areas were using an intensive form of foxtail millet cultivation, complete with storage pits and finely prepared tools for digging and harvesting the crop. The success of the early Chinese millet farmers is still reflected today in the DNA of many modern East Asian populations, such {{studies have shown that}} the ancestors of those farmers probably arrived in the area between 30,000 and 20,000 BP, and their bacterial haplotypes are still found in today populations throughout East Asia.|$|E
25|$|Northern China {{appears to}} have been the {{domestication}} center for foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and <b>broomcorn</b> millet (Panicum miliaceum) with evidence of domestication of these species approximately 8,000 years ago. These species were subsequently widely cultivated in the Yellow River basin (7,500 years ago). Rice was domesticated in southern China later on. Soybean was domesticated in northern China 4,500 years ago. Orange and peach also originated in China. They were cultivated around 2500 BC.|$|E
25|$|Current {{evidence}} suggests that Neolithic material culture was introduced to Europe via western Anatolia, and that similarities in cultures of North Africa and the Pontic steppes are due to diffusion out of Europe. All Neolithic sites in Europe contain ceramics, and contain the plants and animals domesticated in Southwest Asia: einkorn, emmer, barley, lentils, pigs, goats, sheep, and cattle. Genetic data suggest that no independent domestication of animals took place in Neolithic Europe, and that all domesticated animals were originally domesticated in Southwest Asia. The only domesticate not from Southwest Asia was <b>broomcorn</b> millet, domesticated in East Asia. The earliest evidence of cheese-making dates to 5500 BCE in Kujawy, Poland.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipality}} of Broomfield was incorporated in 1961 {{in the southeastern}} corner of Boulder County. While it is unsure how it received its name, most researchers guess it's from the <b>broomcorn</b> grown in the area. Over the next three decades, the city grew through annexations, many of which crossed the county line into three adjacent counties: Adams, Jefferson and Weld. In the 1990s, city leaders began to push {{for the creation of}} a separate county to avoid the inefficiencies of dealing with four separate court districts, four different county seats, and four separate county sales tax bases. It also had longstanding political differences with Boulder County, which impelled it to separate. Broomfield reasoned that it could provide services more responsively under its own county government, and sought an amendment to the Colorado State Constitution to create a new county. The amendment was passed in 1998, after which a three-year transition period followed. On November 15, 2001, Broomfield County became the 64th, newest, and smallest county of Colorado. It is also the newest county in the United States (if not including county equivalents).|$|E
5000|$|Lindsay {{is a city}} in Garvin County, Oklahoma, United States. The {{population}} was 2,840 at the 2010 census. It once promoted itself as [...] "The <b>Broomcorn</b> Capital of the World" [...] but no longer uses that slogan, as <b>broomcorn</b> is no longer raised in the area.|$|E
50|$|Systemic {{flotation}} at {{the site}} yielded over 1,500 grains of <b>broomcorn</b> millet and around 20 grains of foxtail millet. The <b>broomcorn</b> millet is described as being {{in the early stages}} of domestication. and was directly dated to around 7,700 BP. Consequently, this is the earliest directly dated millet in the archaeological record. Despite the evidence for limited millet cultivation, the early Neolithic people at Xinglonggou 1 subsisted primarily on hunting and gathering.|$|E
50|$|Free {{threshing}} wheat, either Triticum aestivum or Triticum turgidum, and <b>broomcorn</b> millet {{were found}} {{in all of the}} cultural layers at Begash.|$|E
5000|$|... 5250-4650 BP: {{during this}} period, the forest was {{composed}} primarily of a coniferous-broadleaf mix. The primary staple crops were foxtail and <b>broomcorn</b> millet.|$|E
50|$|The first {{appearance}} of wheat in East Asia {{coincides with the}} {{first appearance}} of <b>broomcorn</b> millet in Central Asia at Begash, Kazakhstan (4450-4100 BP).|$|E
5000|$|While {{oil and gas}} {{production}} are important to the county economy, agriculture has been the major industry for employment since statehood. In 1907 crops of alfalfa, <b>broomcorn,</b> cotton, onions, potatoes, and hay produced in the county were valued at $2.5 million. By the 1930s over 1000 acre had been planted with paper shelled pecan trees. By 1961 the Lindsay area harvested more <b>broomcorn</b> than any other region in the world, and the county slogan became [...] "We sweep the world." ...|$|E
50|$|From {{the time}} of its founding, the economy of Ellis County has been based on farming and ranching. The most {{important}} crops have been wheat, cotton and <b>broomcorn.</b> In 1907, the town of Shattuck shipped more <b>broomcorn</b> than any other shipping point in the nation. Cattle raising had become important right after the Civil War. A major player locally was the Dominion Cattle Company, part of the Cherokee Strip Livestock Association. Although grazing leases ended with the land run, ranching and cattle feeding remained important. In the 1970s, dairying proved profitable.|$|E
50|$|Manchu cuisine or Manchurian cuisine is {{the cuisine}} of Manchuria, the {{historical}} {{name for a}} region which now covers mostly Northeast China and some parts of Russia. It uses the traditional Manchu staple foods of millet, <b>broomcorn</b> millet, soybean, peas, corn and <b>broomcorn.</b> It relies heavily on preserved foods (often pickling) due to the harsh winters and scorching summers in Northeast China. Manchu cuisine is also known for grilling, wild meat, strong flavours and the wide use of soy sauce. Manchu cuisine is more wheat based than Han Chinese cuisines.|$|E
50|$|The {{residents}} of Karuo suddenly abandoned the settlement around 1750 BC. This is {{likely due to}} a change in climate, as Karuo likely required optimal conditions (higher temperatures) for foxtail millet to be grown successfully; Karuo coincided with a period of warmer temperatures in the region, and a return to cooler temperatures likely made foxtail millet cultivation at the site untenable. <b>Broomcorn</b> millet requires even higher temperatures for cultivation, so the limited evidence for <b>broomcorn</b> millet found at Karuo must have been obtained from trade with lower elevation sites.|$|E
5000|$|Panicum miliaceum: Proso millet (syn. : Common millet, <b>broomcorn</b> millet, hog millet {{or white}} millet, [...] "chena" [...] or chin in Hindi, [...] "pani-varagu" [...] in Tamil, [...] "baragu" [...] in Kannada).|$|E
50|$|Known host {{plants of}} D. grandiosella include sugarcane, forage and grain sorghums, <b>broomcorn,</b> and johnsongrass, teosinte, and millet well as field corn, popcorn, and sweetcorn. It remains a serious {{agricultural}} pest of corn (maize).|$|E
50|$|Other {{field crops}} {{includes}} peanuts, potatoes, sunflowers, sweet potatoes, sugarcane, <b>broomcorn,</b> popcorn, sugar beets, mint, hops, seed crops, hay, silage, forage, etc. Tobacco and cotton can be included here {{if not in}} their own separate category.|$|E
50|$|Agriculture {{has been}} the basis of Carnegie's economy {{throughout}} its history. The main production has been cotton, wheat, <b>broomcorn,</b> cattle, hogs and poultry. Oil production replaced agriculture briefly during the 1970s, but declined in economic importance after 1980.|$|E
5000|$|Sporisorium sorghi is {{a species}} of fungus in the Ustilaginaceae family. It is a plant pathogen, causing covered smut of sorghum spp. such as Sorghum bicolor (S. vulgare) (sorghum), S. sudanense (Sudan grass), S. halepense (Johnson grass) and Sorghum vulgare var. technichum (<b>broomcorn).</b>|$|E
50|$|Sanora Babb {{was born}} in Otoe {{territory}} {{in what is now}} Oklahoma, though neither her mother nor father was Otoe. Her father, Walter, a professional gambler, moved Sanora and her sister Dorothy to a one-room dugout on a <b>broomcorn</b> farm settled by her grandfather near Lamar, Colorado.|$|E
50|$|The county's {{economy has}} {{historically}} been based on agriculture, specifically wheat farming, poultry raising and cattle ranching. Major crops have included corn, wheat, Kaffir corn, <b>broomcorn</b> and alfalfa. The Hallren Poultry and Creamery founded in Fairview in 1936 was the county's largest employer by the late 1950s.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} crop was foxtail millet, but traces of <b>broomcorn</b> millet, rice and wheat {{have also been}} found. Rice grains {{have been found in}} Shandong and southern Henan, and a small rice field has been found on the Liaodong peninsula. Specialized tools for digging, harvesting and grinding grain have been recovered.|$|E
50|$|The county {{economy has}} been based mainly on farming and raising livestock. The major crops have been cotton, wheat, alfalfa, kafir, milo maize, and <b>broomcorn.</b> Mineral {{industries}} have occasionally been significant. In the early 20th century, there was some salt production. A limited amount {{of oil and gas}} production began in the 1920s.|$|E
50|$|Agriculture {{and cattle}} {{production}} {{have been very}} important to the county income since before statehood. Grains, especially wheat, were the largest crop. However, <b>broomcorn</b> grew abundantly. Broom factories operated in Woodward and Mooreland. Castor beans, grown during World War I, were processed into castor oil, which was used as a lubricant for aircraft engines.|$|E
50|$|Direct AMS dating of <b>broomcorn</b> millet {{and wheat}} seeds from Begash date to around 2460-2150 BC. Most {{of the seeds}} were {{recovered}} from cist burials, with very few seeds being recovered from hearths. As {{almost all of the}} seeds came from burial contexts, the domesticated wheat and millet was most likely primarily used only for ritual purposes.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, archaeologists {{found an}} {{earthenware}} bowl containing world's oldest known noodles, about 4000 years old, at the Lajia archaeological {{site of the}} Qijia culture along the Yellow River in China. The noodles were well-preserved. After analysing the noodle remains in 2004, {{it was determined that}} the noodles were made from foxtail millet and <b>broomcorn</b> millet.|$|E
50|$|The {{group has}} participated {{in a number of}} parades {{including}} the Holiday Bowl parade in San Diego, California, the Fiesta Bowl parade in Tempe, Arizona, the Indianapolis 500 parade, and the NFL Hall of Fame Game parade in Canton, Ohio. The group considers the <b>Broomcorn</b> Festival parade in their hometown of Arcola to be their flagship parade.|$|E
5000|$|A {{complete}} {{system for}} imperial cuisine was developed which included procurement and diets preparation. Every {{process of making}} and serving imperial cuisine was done in a fixed order according to the [...] "eating principles". Many famous dishes were developed through creating imperial food such as the six cereals stew which included rice, millet, <b>broomcorn,</b> sorghum, wheat and wild rice.|$|E
5000|$|... 4650-4300 BP: around 4650 BP, {{the forest}} saw a drastic transition, most {{likely due to}} {{anthropogenic}} causes. The forest fauna came to be dominated primarily by fast-growing bamboo. Additionally, several fruit and nut-bearing trees (Castanea, Prunus cerasus, Prunus padus and Diospyros) became more commonly found. The primary staple crops were foxtail millet, <b>broomcorn</b> millet, and buckwheat.|$|E
50|$|Begash phase 1a (2460-1950 BC): {{this is the}} {{earliest}} period, dating from the Middle Bronze Age. A stone structure was found from this period. The first burials, coming from this period, were cist burials. The domesticated animal remains came overwhelming from sheep and goats, with some coming from cattle. Wheat and <b>broomcorn</b> millet seeds were first found from this period.|$|E
50|$|The Lower Xiajiadian site (Xinglonggou 3 or Locality 3) is a Bronze Age settlement. The {{site was}} {{excavated}} in 2003. The settlement was enclosed by a ditch. The flora assemblage {{at this site}} consists primarily of crop remains. Both <b>broomcorn</b> and foxtail millet were found at Xinglonggou 3. The site has yielded the earliest evidence for soybean in Northeast China.|$|E
50|$|Meyaneh is East Azerbaijan's {{third largest}} city after Tabriz and Maragheh, and its {{population}} {{has continued to}} increase in each census. In the late 20th century many newly formed companies were established in the city, which became an economically strategic city for East Azerbaijan. The main, large-scale crop in the area is <b>broomcorn,</b> {{which is used to}} make traditional brooms.|$|E
50|$|The county {{economy has}} {{depended}} on agriculture, which has benefitted {{from the fact}} that it lies above the Ogallala Aquifer. Principal crops have included Kaffir corn, <b>broomcorn,</b> wheat, cotton, corn, and alfalfa. Farms have been consolidating throughout the period since the Great Depression. In 1930, there were 2,353 farms, averaging 278.3 acres each. By 2000, there were 680 farms, averaging 1,015.54 acres each.|$|E
50|$|Karuo is {{the site}} of the oldest {{permanent}} settlement in Tibet and represents the earliest evidence for agriculture on the Tibetan Plateau. Agriculturally, the people at Karuo relied primarily on foxtail millet, while some evidence for <b>broomcorn</b> millet was also discovered. The oldest evidence for foxtail millet at Karuo dates to around 3000 BC. The people of Karuo also supplemented their diet with hunting.|$|E
50|$|Wheat (free-threshing hexaploid) {{and barley}} (both naked and hulled) were {{discovered}} at the site, while evidence for <b>broomcorn</b> millet and pulses were not found. The naked barley found at Sarazm {{is similar in}} morphology to the barley found in sites in Pakistan such as Mehrgarh and Nausharo, and also similar to the barley found in the earliest sites in China where barley was first found.|$|E
5000|$|The {{local economy}} {{has been based on}} {{agriculture}} since the land was opened to non-Indian settlement. The major crops initially were <b>broomcorn</b> and cotton. Seiling soon had a cotton gin and a feed mill. Wheat and rye became important crops before World War I. In 1918, the Seiling Milling Company opened a flour mill and marketed [...] "White Rose Special" [...] flour until it closed in 1952.|$|E
5000|$|Chatang ( [...] ; pinyin: chátāng; {{literally}} [...] "tea soup") or seasoned flour mush is {{a traditional}} gruel common to both Beijing cuisine and Tianjin cuisine, and often sold as a snack on the street. It is made from sorghum flour and/or <b>broomcorn</b> millet and/or proso millet flour and glutinous millet flour. The Chinese name is figurative, not literal, as there is neither any tea nor any soup in this dish.|$|E
