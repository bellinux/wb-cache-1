50|$|On lap 2, {{there was}} a multi-car pileup in turn 1 that {{involved}} at least 9 cars, including Dale Earnhardt, Ted Musgrave, Darrell Waltrip, John Andretti, Rick Mast, Kenny Wallace, Kevin Lepage, Hut Stricklin and Jeff Gordon. Andretti's car caught fire when his fuel <b>pump</b> <b>broke.</b> This was {{very similar to the}} start of the previous year's race.|$|R

50|$|Lehto was overjoyed to {{gain the}} first podium place of his career for Dallara, with Martini 4th. Van de Poele's drive ended when a fuel <b>pump</b> <b>broke</b> on the last lap - he was {{classified}} ninth overall. The Lotus drivers of Mika Häkkinen and Bailey took 5th and 6th, both scoring their first world championship points, an unexpected result for the troubled team since their cars had barely managed to enter the grid with Häkkinen 25th and Bailey 26th.|$|R
50|$|On 4 December, {{while the}} crew of G-1 was {{charging}} batteries, a circulating <b>pump</b> <b>broke</b> down and severely overheated the port engine. That mishap — combined with a steering gear overhaul at New York — kept ship's force busy in the yard for the next thirteen months. While there, G-1 was assigned (SS-19½) as her official hull number on 12 June 1916. Finally, {{after a few days}} of familiarization training, the crew sailed the boat to New London on 23 January 1917.|$|R
5000|$|The Center for Energy and Security Studies, a Moscow-based {{independent}} think tank, {{explained the}} construction delays {{of the plant}} as partly due to a [...] "shortage of skilled Russian engineering and construction specialists with suitable experience".

Aging equipment at the plant {{has also been a}} problem and, in February 2011, a 30-year-old German cooling <b>pump</b> <b>broke,</b> sending metal debris into the system. In 2010, the IAEA noted that the facility was understaffed.|$|R
60|$|When it {{was over}} and the table had been cleared, he lay in a canvas chair beside the stove, {{listening}} to the resinous billets snapping and crackling cheerfully.

50|$|It is {{impossible}} to say whether Holland would have finished the Tour or, if he had, in what position. He was considered a novelty by organisers and the spectators, who knew nothing of cycling in Britain, and {{that led to his}} being adopted by the French team. The French called him Sir Holland and helped with advice, accommodation and food. But the first interests of French officials was always going to be with their own riders, which explains Holland's isolation when his <b>pump</b> <b>broke</b> and he ran out of tyres.|$|R
50|$|The mall was {{the result}} of a rivalry between mall {{developer}} Taubman Centers and ForestCity, both who sought to build a new upscale center in Richmond. The battle was eventually settled in court, which ultimately saw Taubman building Stony Point, and ForestCity building the rival, two-story Short Pump Town Center, which is nearly two times the size of Stony Point. Short <b>Pump</b> <b>broke</b> ground in November 2000, but Stony Point didn't break ground until February 2002. Stony Point finally opened on September 18, 2003, the day Hurricane Isabel made landfall in nearby Outer Banks.|$|R
50|$|World 600 - Before Petty Enterprises {{left for}} the Charlotte Motor Speedway engine builder Maurice Petty created a race motor that had the same {{horsepower}} as their qualifying motor; Richard unleashed that horsepower leading 311 laps and winning by over half a lap; he broke away from early battles with Pearson and Donnie Allison and past halfway executed a risky three-abreast pass in the trioval around Pearson and Bobby Allison driving Benny Parsons' Chevrolet in relief and Coo Coo Marlin's lapped car. Cale Yarborough <b>broke</b> a water <b>pump</b> and lost 50 laps getting repairs; his point lead was thus sliced nearly in half, to 108 points.|$|R
5000|$|A {{crowd of}} peasants had {{gathered}} around me but they couldn't help me. A priest {{brought me a}} bottle of beer, and although it quenched my thirst it got me no further. After I had given up hope, a tourist came along {{and gave me a}} tubular touring tyre. I put it on, and in the excitement of the moment the rod of the <b>pump</b> <b>broke.</b> We blew the tyre hard with another pump but the tyre fitted so loosely on the rim that it came off with the fingers and so was unsafe. Another tyre was found that fitted a little better, and again I set off, but I had by then given up hope. Charles Holland, 1937? ...|$|R
50|$|From its {{launch in}} 1961, {{the ice cream}} was made using cream and natural {{ingredients}} for the flavorings, in contrast with competing brands which used often artificial ingredients. It was high in butterfat and had less air, which, according to Rose Mattus' autobiography, {{was the result of}} a factory accident, when the air injection <b>pump</b> <b>broke.</b> Reuben developed the flavors and Rose marketed the product. Her first marketing ploy was to dress up elegantly - in keeping with the upmarket positioning of the brand - and give away free samples at local grocers. Another part of her strategy was to market the brand to university students, and she made certain that ice cream parlors near New York University in Greenwich Village carried Häagen-Dazs. The brand, which grew only slowly through the 1960s, was at first distributed nationally by Greyhound Bus deliveries to college towns. By 1973, it was sold throughout the United States, and in 1976 the first Häagen-Dazs store opened in Brooklyn.|$|R
5000|$|Lauda's McLaren MP4/2 <b>broke</b> {{its water}} <b>pump</b> at half-distance, the second such failure for the TAG-Porsche engine after Prost {{suffered}} {{the same fate}} on the warm up lap in South Africa. Shortly afterwards Winkelhock stopped and Andrea de Cesaris lived up to his nickname of [...] "de Crasheris" [...] when he crashed his Ligier JS23-Renault. Piquet found himself third after the stops, but faded as the race neared its conclusion. Arnoux moved into third until he was caught by Rosberg. Piquet's BMW engine blew and with a lap to go Rosberg ran out of fuel, allowing Arnoux to join Alboreto and Warwick on the podium. Alboreto had given Goodyear its first win in Formula One. Rosberg was classified fourth. De Angelis finished fifth in his Lotus with Stefan Bellof completing the points finishers in his Tyrrell 012-Ford. Just nine cars finished although eleven were classified including the late retirements of Rosberg and Piquet.|$|R
25|$|On 31 May 1958 Henry Blogg {{took part}} in an unusual rescue when she was called to aid the Sheringham {{lifeboat}} Forester's Centenary. This service began with a call at 9.50am to the Sheringham honorary secretary from the Trinity House Superintendent of Great Yarmouth requesting that a sick man {{be taken off the}} Dudgeon Light-vessel. At 10.15am the Sheringham lifeboat Forester's Centenary was launched with a doctor on board and she reached the light-vessel by 1.10pm. The doctor went aboard the light-vessel and dispensed a sedative to the sick man and he was then strapped to a stretcher and transferred to the Forester's Centenary. The lifeboat then set off on the return journey to her station. Nine miles north east from home at around 4.40pm the Forester's Centenary was in trouble when her skew gear which drives the lifeboat's oil and water <b>pumps</b> <b>broke</b> down. Henry Blogg was called out and had to take the Sheringham lifeboat in to tow. Both boats arrived back at the Sheringham station at 7.00pm and the sick man was taken to hospital.|$|R
5000|$|On 12 January 1974, {{enlisted men}} and non-commissioned {{officers}} of the Fourth Brigade stationed at the Military Base protested over their substandard living conditions. [...] "There was nothing new about discontent among soldiers serving in the desolate conditions in these far-flung garrisons," [...] note Marina and David Ottaway. [...] "The heat was unbearable, the food barely edible, and the water was bad or in short supply". The last straw was when the officers refused to let the soldiers use their well after their own water <b>pump</b> <b>broke</b> down. The soldiers arrested their superior officers and petitioned Emperor Haile Sellasie for redress of their grievances. The Emperor sent Lieutenant-General Deresse Dubale to investigate the matter; the mutineers took him prisoner, forced him {{to eat and drink}} as they did, then tied him up and put him under a tree for eight hours while they negotiated with the defense ministry. Furious, the Emperor sent two bombers to overfly the garrison and intimidate them to release Deresse, but did not punish the soldiers. The whole incident was hushed up for a while.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was also}} well that Bill's {{momentary}} attitude of didactic propriety was not further {{excited by the}} subsequent conduct of his protege. For by this time Tom, half supporting the unstable Johnson, who developed a tendency to occasionally dash across the glaring road, but checked himself mid way each time, reached the corral which adjoined the Mansion House. At its farther extremity was a pump and horse-trough. Here, without a word being spoken, but evidently in obedience to some habitual custom, Tom led his companion. With the boy's assistance, Johnson removed his coat and neckcloth, turned back {{the collar of his}} shirt, and gravely placed his head beneath the pump-spout. With equal gravity and deliberation, Tom took his place at the handle. For a few moments only the splashing of water and regular strokes of the <b>pump</b> <b>broke</b> the solemnly ludicrous silence. Then there was a pause in which Johnson put his hands to his dripping head, felt of it critically as if it belonged to somebody else, and raised his eyes to his companion. [...] "That ought to fetch IT," [...] said Tom, in answer to the look. [...] "Ef it don't," [...] replied Johnson, doggedly, with an air of relieving himself of all further responsibility in the matter, [...] "it's got to, thet's all!" ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Lesions {{located in}} the area of the tibial spines are rare. In most cases, {{treatment}} follows histological diagnosis, but when imaging and clinical data are considered to be "very" characteristic for benign lesions, such as chondroblastoma or osteoid osteoma, treatment may be performed without biopsy. Traditional curettage requires opening the joint, which presents a high risk of contamination of the joint itself and surrounding structures, such as the popliteal area, with possible contamination of the neurovascular bundle when performing curettage with the posterior approach. In this case, the re-excision of a local recurrence would be extremely difficult. Results We describe a technique using arthroscopic guidance for radiofrequency thermoablation of a benign lesion in the tibial spines area. We report on an illustrative case. The patient so treated, reported immediate relief from the pain, and after two weeks, was free of pain. The biopsy performed before the treatment confirmed the radiological diagnosis of chondroblastoma. At one year of follow-up, the patient is without pain, with a 0 - 130 °range of motion, has no activity limitations and is apparently free of disease. Conclusion This technique allows a radiofrequency thermoablation of a lesion in the tibial spines area and in the posterior tibial surface to be performed without opening the joint, monitoring the tibial plateau surface, probably decreasing the risk of cartilage damage. Unfortunately, in the case presented, the high pressure from the arthroscopy's <b>pump</b> <b>broke</b> the tibial plateau surface creating a communication to the tibial tunnel used for thermoablation. </p...|$|R
40|$|In situ {{carbonation}} of basaltic rocks {{could provide}} a long-term carbon storage solution, which {{is essential for the}} success and public acceptance of carbon storage. To demonstrate the viability of this carbon storage solution, 175 tonnes (t) of pure CO 2 and 73 tonnes (t) of a 75 % CO 2 - 24 % H 2 S- 1 % H 2 -gas mixture were sequentially injected into basaltic rocks at the CarbFix site at Hellisheidi, SW-Iceland from January to August 2012. This paper reports the chemistry and saturation states with respect to potential secondary minerals of sub-surface fluids sampled prior to, during, and after the injections. All gases were dissolved in water during their injection into permeable basalts located at 500 – 800 m depth with temperatures ranging from 20 to 50 °C. A pH decrease and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) increase was observed in the first monitoring well, HN- 04, about two weeks after each injection began. At storage reservoir target depth, this diverted monitoring well is located ∼ 125 m downstream from the injection well. A significant increase in H 2 S concentration, however, was not observed after the second injection. Sampled fluids from the HN- 04 well show a rapid increase in Ca, Mg, and Fe concentration during the injections with a gradual decline in the following months. Calculations indicate that the sampled fluids are saturated with respect to siderite about four weeks after the injections began, and these fluids attained calcite saturation about three months after each injection. Pyrite is supersaturated prior to and during the mixed gas injection and in the following months. In July 2013, the HN- 04 fluid sampling <b>pump</b> <b>broke</b> down due to calcite precipitation, verifying the carbonation of the injected CO 2. Mass balance calculations, based on the recovery of non-reactive tracers co-injected into the subsurface together with the acid-gases, confirm that more than 95 % of the CO 2 injected into the subsurface was mineralised within a year, and essentially all of the injected H 2 S was mineralised within four months of its injection. These results demonstrate the viability of the in situ mineralisation of these gases in basaltic rocks as a long-term and safe storage solution for CO 2 and H 2 S...|$|R
5000|$|... 1962 saw {{a return}} to the road circuit only and the banking was never used again for Formula One. It still stands, but in {{decrepit}} condition; the last time it was used was in 1969 for the 1000 kilometer sports car race that year. Briton Graham Hill won the race, and would go on to win the Drivers' Championship in South Africa soon after. 1963 saw an attempted use of the extremely fast full circuit again, and the drivers ran the course during Friday practice but the concrete banking was so rough and bumpy that cars were being mechanically torn apart. It was feared {{that there would be no}} finishers for the actual race itself. Briton Bob Anderson's Lola crashed after losing a wheel on the banking (he was not injured); the drivers then threatened to walk off unless they raced on the road circuit only, which is what happened. Jim Clark won the race in a Lotus. Ferrari driver John Surtees won in 1964, and Briton Jackie Stewart won his first of 27 Grand Prix victories in 1965, driving for BRM. Against team orders, he fought hard with his teammate Graham Hill, Hill made a mistake at the Parabolica and Stewart was in command; this was all to the chagrin of team boss Tony Rudd. 1966 saw Italian Ludovico Scarfiotti win, and no other Italian has won the race since. 1967 was to be a race of interest and was to produce the first of three close finishes on the fast Monza circuit over the next four years. Surtees, now driving for Honda, battled with Australian Jack Brabham, and Surtees won the race by two-tenths of a second; and Clark, who had problems at the beginning of the race and lost a whole lap, stormed around the circuit, equalled his pole position time and unlapped himself to take the lead- but his fuel <b>pump</b> <b>broke</b> and he coasted over the line to finish third. 1969 saw four drivers; Stewart, Austrian Jochen Rindt, Frenchman Jean-Pierre Beltoise and New Zealander Bruce McLaren battle right down to the line. Stewart came out on top and beat Rindt by eight-hundredths of a second. The four drivers were all within two-tenths of a second of each other. With this win, Stewart won his first of three championships.1970 saw Rindt's fatal crash during qualifying at the wheel of his rear wing-less Lotus. He would become the only posthuomous world champion, after Ferrari driver Jacky Ickx failed to overhaul Rindt. Ickx's teammate Clay Regazzoni won the race, which saw 28 lead changes. 1971 was to see the third close finish in four years. Briton Peter Gethin, Swede Ronnie Peterson, Frenchman François Cevert, Briton Mike Hailwood and New Zealander Howden Ganley battled for the lead all race. On the last lap, Peterson got the inside line for the Parabolica, but Gethin got in front going alongside Peterson through the long right-hand corner, and beat Peterson to the checkered flag by the slimmest of margins; one-one hundredth of a second. Cevert and Hailwood finished within two-tenths and Ganley was half a second behind.|$|R
