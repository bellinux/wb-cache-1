5|$|Government {{agencies}} {{in both the}} USA and Canada have utilized a native species of parasitoid wasp, Cerceris fumipennis, {{as a means of}} detecting areas to which emerald ash <b>borer</b> has spread. The females of these wasps hunt other jewel beetles and emerald ash <b>borer</b> if it is present. The wasps stun the beetles and carry them back to their burrows in the ground where they are stored until the wasps’ eggs hatch and the wasp larvae feed on the beetles. Volunteers catch the wasps as they return to their burrows carrying the beetles to determine whether emerald ash <b>borer</b> is present. This methodology is known as biological surveillance, as opposed to biological control, because it does not appear that the wasps have a significant negative impact on emerald ash <b>borer</b> populations.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} emerald ash <b>borer</b> {{has not yet}} been detected, surveys are used to monitor for new infestations. Visual surveys are used to find ash trees {{displaying}} emerald ash <b>borer</b> damage, and traps with colors attractive to emerald ash <b>borer,</b> such as purple or green, are hung in trees as part of a monitoring program. These traps can also have volatile pheromones applied to them that attract primarily males.|$|E
5|$|Emerald ash <b>borer</b> {{threatens the}} entire North American Fraxinus genus. It has {{killed at least}} tens of {{millions}} of ash trees so far and threatens to kill most of the 8.7 billion ash trees throughout North America. Emerald ash <b>borer</b> kills young trees several years before reaching their seeding age of 10 years. In both North America and Europe, the loss of ash from an ecosystem can result in increased numbers of invasive plants, changes in soil nutrients, and effects on species that feed on ash.|$|E

5|$|Outside {{its native}} range, emerald ash <b>borer</b> is an {{invasive}} species {{that is highly}} destructive to ash trees in its introduced range. Prior to emerald ash <b>borer</b> being found in North America, very little was known about emerald ash <b>borer</b> in its native range aside from a short description of life-history traits and taxonomic descriptions, which resulted in focused research on its biology in North America. Since its accidental introduction into the United States and Canada in the 1990s and its subsequent detection in 2002 in Canton, Michigan, it has since spread {{other parts of the}} North America. It is suspected that it was introduced from overseas in shipping materials such as packing crates.|$|E

5|$|The native {{range of}} emerald ash <b>borer</b> in Asia was {{surveyed}} for parasitoid species that parasitize emerald ash <b>borer</b> {{and do not}} attack other insect species in the hope they would suppress populations when released in North America. Three species imported from China were approved for release by the USDA in 2007 and in Canada in 2013: Spathius agrili, Tetrastichus planipennisi, and Oobius agrili, while Spathius galinae was approved for release in 2015. Excluding Spathius galinae, which has only recently been released, the other three species have been documented parasitizing emerald ash <b>borer</b> larvae one year after release, indicating that they survived the winter, but establishment varied among species and locations. Tetrastichus planipennisi and Oobius agrili established and have had increasing populations in Michigan since 2008; Spathius agrili has had lower establishment success in North America, which {{could be due to}} a lack of available emerald ash <b>borer</b> larvae at the time of adult emergence in spring, limited cold tolerance, and better suitability to regions of North America below the 40th parallel.|$|E

40|$|Corn <b>borers</b> are an {{important}} maize (Zea mays L.) pest in northwestern Spain. In order to use methods of control or to breed plant material against corn <b>borers</b> {{it is necessary to}} know the life cycle and behavior of this pest. The objectives of this work were to complete the study of the incidence of corn <b>borers</b> in northwestern Spain, to study the behavior of the two species of corn <b>borers</b> inside the plant, and to relate the abundance of <b>borers</b> with climatic factors. To monitor the incidence of the corn <b>borers,</b> data were taken in four localities of the northwest of Spain, during seven years (1997 - 2003). Sesamia nonagrioides is the most important pest in the coast. Ostrinia nubilalis is as important as S. nonagrioides in the inlands. There were two generations of both <b>borers</b> but a third generation can occur. Damage could hardly be predicted from studying the abundance of adults. S. nonagrioides and O. nubilalis had the same distribution inside the plant and it seems that both species can coexist. Research supported by the Xunta de Galicia (Project Cod.

5|$|Without {{factors that}} would {{normally}} suppress emerald ash <b>borer</b> populations in its native range (e.g., resistant trees, predators, and parasitoid wasps), populations can quickly rise to damaging levels. After initial infestation, all ash trees are expected to die in an area within 10 years without control measures. Every North American ash species has susceptibility to emerald ash <b>borer,</b> as North American species planted in China also have high mortality due to infestations, but some Chinese ash species are resistant.|$|E
5|$|Emerald ash <b>borer</b> {{primarily}} infest and {{can cause}} significant damage to ash species including green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata) in North America. In Europe, Fraxinus excelsior is the main ash species colonized by EAB. Ash susceptibility can vary due to the attractiveness of chemical volatiles to adults, or the ability of larvae to detoxify phenolic compounds. Emerald ash <b>borer</b> has also been found infesting white fringe tree in North America, which is a non-ash host, but {{it is unclear whether}} the trees were healthy when first infested, or were already in decline due to drought.|$|E
5|$|In {{its native}} range, emerald ash <b>borer</b> {{is only a}} {{nuisance}} pest on native trees, as population densities typically do not reach levels lethal to healthy trees.

50|$|Ten {{species of}} {{flatheaded}} <b>borers</b> {{of the family}} Buprestidae feed on spruce and fir, but hemlock is their preferred food source (Rose and Lindquist 1985). As with roundheaded <b>borers,</b> most feeding occurs in dying or dead trees, or close to injuries on living trees. Damage becomes abundant only where a continuing supply of breeding material is available. The life history of these <b>borers</b> {{is similar to that}} of the roundheaded <b>borers,</b> but some exceedingly long life cycles have been reported under adverse conditions. Full-grown larvae, up to 25 mm long, are characteristically flattened, the anterior part of the body being much broader than the rest.

5|$|North American {{predators and}} parasitoids can {{occasionally}} cause high emerald ash <b>borer</b> mortality, but generally offer only limited control. Mortality due to native woodpeckers is variable. Parasitism by parasitoids such as Atanycolus cappaerti can be high, but overall such control is generally low.|$|E
5|$|Once an {{infestation}} is detected, quarantines {{are typically}} imposed by state or national government agencies disallowing transport of ash firewood or live plants outside {{of these areas}} without permits indicating the material has been inspected or treated (i.e., heat treatment or wood chipping) to ensure no live emerald ash <b>borer</b> {{are present in the}} bark and phloem. In urban areas, trees are often removed once an infestation is found to reduce emerald ash <b>borer</b> population densities and the likelihood of further spread. Urban ash are typically replaced with non-ash species such as maple, oak, or linden to limit food sources. In rural areas, trees can be harvested for lumber or firewood to reduce ash stand density, but quarantines may apply for this material, especially in areas where the material could be infested.|$|E

5|$|Agrilus planipennis, {{commonly}} known as the emerald ash <b>borer,</b> is a green buprestid or jewel beetle native to northeastern Asia that feeds on ash species. Females lay eggs in bark crevices on ash trees, and larvae feed underneath the bark of ash trees to emerge as adults in one to two years. In its native range, it is typically found at low densities and does not cause significant damage to trees native to the area. Outside its native range, it is an invasive species and is highly destructive to ash trees native to northwest Europe and North America. Prior to being found in North America, very little was known about emerald ash <b>borer</b> in its native range; this has resulted in much of the research on its biology being focused in North America. Local governments in North America are attempting to control it by monitoring its spread, diversifying tree species, insecticides, and biological control.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} massive and severe {{infection}} of invasive pests, techniques of pest control {{are often used}} in combination. An example is the emerald ash <b>borer,</b> Agrilus planipennis, an invasive beetle from China, which has destroyed {{tens of millions of}} ash trees in its introduced range in North America. As part of the campaign against it, from 2003 American scientists and the Chinese Academy of Forestry searched for its natural enemies in the wild, leading to the discovery of several parasitoid wasps, namely Tetrastichus planipennisi, a gregarious larval endoparasitoid, Oobius agrili, a solitary, parthenogenic egg parasitoid, and Spathius agrili, a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid. These have been introduced and released into the United States of America as a possible biological control of the emerald ash <b>borer.</b> Initial results for Tetrastichus planipennisi have shown promise, and it is now being released along with Beauveria bassiana, a fungal pathogen with known insecticidal properties.|$|E
