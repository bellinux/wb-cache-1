He was accused of reneging on child support {{payments}} to a woman whom he had fathered a child with out of wedlock.

5|$|Several {{explanations}} for the observed elevated temperatures and the resulting plumes have been proposed, including venting from a subsurface reservoir of liquid water, sublimation of ice, decompression and dissociation of clathrates, and shear heating, but a complete explanation of all the heat sources causing the observed thermal power output of Enceladus has not yet <b>been</b> <b>settled.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Somerset Levels—specifically dry {{points at}} Glastonbury and Brent Knoll— {{also have a}} long history of settlement, and are known to have <b>been</b> <b>settled</b> by Mesolithic hunters.

5|$|The {{first public}} {{performance}} of opera {{in the new}} theatre took place on 26 January 1793, the dispute with the Lord Chamberlain over the licence having <b>been</b> <b>settled.</b> This theatre was, at that time, the largest in England, and it became {{the home of the}} Theatre Royal, Drury Lane company while that company's home theatre was itself rebuilt between 1791–94.|$|E

5|$|Anna's hold on {{the western}} limits of his kingdom, which bordered on the Fen lands that {{surrounded}} the Isle of Ely, was strengthened by the marriage in 651 (or slightly later) of his daughter Æthelthryth to Tondberht, a prince of the South Gyrwe, a {{people living in the}} fens who may have <b>been</b> <b>settled</b> in the area around Ely. Æthelthryth, accompanied by her minister Owine, travelled from Ely to Northumbria when she married for the second time, to Ecgfrith.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the debts}} {{related to the}} costs for the {{construction}} of the building having <b>been</b> <b>settled</b> in the early-mid 19th century, and the church ceasing to exist 100 years later, the three acts of Parliament allowing trustees of the church to levy rates on properties in the parish for the purpose of settling those debts remained in force and untouched until the Law Commission proposed their repeal in July 2014, with a view to presenting recommendations to Parliament in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, {{during the}} {{recording}} {{process of the}} band's third studio album, Thirty Seconds to Mars attempted to sign with a new label, prompting EMI (the parent label of Virgin), to file a $30 million breach of contract lawsuit. After nearly a year of legal battles, the band announced on April 28, 2009, that the suit had <b>been</b> <b>settled</b> following a defence based on the De Havilland Law. Thirty Seconds to Mars then signed a new contract with EMI and released their third album This Is War in December 2009 to critical acclaim.|$|E

5|$|In December, Wellington's former Quartermaster General, Sir George Murray, {{was sent}} to Canada with the local rank of {{lieutenant}} general, specifically to order Prévost to return to London to explain his conduct of the Plattsburg campaign. Another Peninsular War veteran and Manley Power's previous commanding officer, Sir Edward Pakenham, became {{the commander of the}} British North American army. Manley Power took part in the Battle of New Orleans, where Pakenham was killed, which unbeknown to its participants occurred after the war had already <b>been</b> <b>settled</b> in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|Motul de San José {{was first}} settled between 600 and 300 BC, {{in the latter}} portion of the Middle Preclassic period, when it was {{probably}} a fairly small site. At this time some of its satellite sites were also settled, including La Trinidad de Nosotros and Buena Vista, both of which would have been small villages at this time, and they may have <b>been</b> <b>settled</b> even earlier in the Middle Preclassic, between 800 and 600 BC.|$|E
5|$|Once peace {{agreements}} {{had finally}} <b>been</b> <b>settled</b> – the French Governor of Bayonne being the last, on 26 April – the army left the Peninsula; the infantry marched to Bordeaux for transportation {{to their new}} postings.

5|$|Radstock has <b>been</b> <b>settled</b> {{since the}} Iron Age, and its {{importance}} grew after {{the construction of}} the Fosse Way, a Roman road. The growth of the town occurred after 1763, when coal was discovered in the area. Large numbers of mines opened during the 19th century including several owned by the Waldegrave family, who had been Lords of the Manor since the English Civil War. Admiral Lord Radstock, brother of George, fourth Earl Waldegrave, took the town's name as his title when created a Baron.|$|E
5|$|Settlers moved {{further south}} {{into what is}} now the Namadgi National Park. William Herbert made a claim over part of the Orroral Valley at some point between 1826 and 1836, while during the 1830s Garrett Cotter {{inhabited}} what would later be named the Cotter River Valley, in his honour. From the late 1830s, the Boboyan Homestead and station were established. Gudgenby was settled in the early 1840s and the Gudgenby Homestead was erected around this time. By 1848 most of the major valleys of the Namadgi area had <b>been</b> <b>settled.</b>|$|E
5|$|The new Parliament met in 1904 {{and reached}} a compromise, {{choosing}} Dalgety, which, like Bombala, {{was located in}} the Monaro region. Thus, {{with the passage of}} the Seat of Government Act 1904, it appeared that the matter had <b>been</b> <b>settled.</b> However, while the Federal Parliament supported Dalgety, the New South Wales government did not, and they proved unwilling to cede the amount of territory the Federal Government demanded.|$|E

5|$|This area {{of northeastern}} Wales has <b>been</b> <b>settled</b> since prehistoric times, the Romans built a fort beside a ford on the River Conwy, and the Normans and Welsh disputed the territory. They built their castles at {{strategic}} locations as they advanced and retreated, {{but in the}} end, England prevailed, and Edward I conquered the country in 1282. In the following centuries, the Welsh people were repressed and there were numerous uprisings and rebellions against English rule. The Act of Union in 1535 incorporated Wales under the English Crown and made it subject to English law.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most of Dunedin, {{which was}} settled by Scots, many early {{settlers}} in Caversham were English. This {{led to some}} degree of antagonism by the councils {{of the city and}} Caversham borough {{in the early days of}} settlement; Dunedin had <b>been</b> <b>settled</b> by the Presbyterian church, whereas Caversham's population was largely Anglican, Methodist, and Baptist. There is little evidence of this distinction in modern Caversham, other than the origins of local street names, several of which reflect the names of English counties and early English settlers.|$|E
5|$|By 1990, 52,000 black {{families}} had <b>been</b> <b>settled</b> on 6.5 million acres. This was insufficient {{to deal with}} the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts. The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 {{black families}} on 13 million acres, which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned.|$|E
