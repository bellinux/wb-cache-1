40|$|The Egyptian {{economy is}} {{typically}} described as redistributive, following the framework established by Karl Polanyi. In a redistributive system, the state supports its population by gathering goods from producers and redistributing them {{among the general}} population. Previous studies on the Egyptian economy support this theory with textual data from the New Kingdom (ca. 1550 - 1060 BC). In {{order to create a}} basis for an economic model for the Old Kingdom (ca. 2600 - 2200 BC) by using data internal to that period, this study analyzes ceramics, particularly beer jars and bd 3 <b>bread</b> <b>moulds.</b> These two ceramic types were the main vessels used in the production and distribution of bread and beer, cornerstones in the Egyptian non-monetary economy. If the economy was truly state-run, one would expect these vessels to have a standardized volume throughout the country, allowing the government to control and measure the redistribution of resources. In order to assess standardization, this study focused on a sample of beer jars and <b>bread</b> <b>moulds</b> from fifteen sites throughout Egypt, both central and provincial. The volumes of these vessels were measured through a combination of filling on-site (when the author was able to work with the actual vessel) and calculation through Pot Utility v. 1. 05 (when only the drawing was available for analysis). Standardization within a sample was then assessed by application of the Coefficient of Variation (CV). Through this method, standardization is shown to have been absent not only in the volumes of these samples when viewed as a unity across Egypt, but also when viewed at the level of a single site during a single period. Data from the iconographic, textual, and archaeological record supplement and support this finding. The study also addresses the few exceptions to this rule. This lack of standardization suggests that control of both ceramic production and distribution of goods did not rest in the hands of central or local governments. Local, informal economies appear to have been the norm in the Old Kingdom, not a large, state-controlled redistribution system. ...|$|R
50|$|Eventually {{the song}} {{turns into a}} more regular style video clip, {{with a group of}} {{teenagers}} partying in a house. The camera moves into the house to see them all drinking and enjoying themselves, as a standard teenage party would expect to be seen. As the camera moves into the back room, a teenage girl is seen vomiting on the floor, overlooked by a member of TISM. The video then turns into a series of disappointing moments, all watched by a member of TISM, such as a woman finding her fresh <b>bread</b> has <b>mould</b> on it and the toilet roll is empty. Back in the house {{one of the most notorious}} and well known scenes of the video shows a dog eating the vomit from earlier. Meanwhile, outside a couple argue, once again as a member of TISM watches on.|$|R
50|$|From September 2000 the School {{introduced}} foundation {{degrees in}} Baking Technology Management. During 2004 bakery students worked with designer Jean Paul Gaultier to recreate {{some of his}} iconic designs in bread. Another interesting commission was received in 1996 when artist Sharon Baker asked to bake <b>bread</b> in life-size <b>moulds</b> she had had made by lifecast artists CJ Munn and Andre Masters of herself.

50|$|Still {{working in}} Freiburg, Voronin decided to devote {{himself to the}} {{investigation}} of fungi. After taking a Master's degree in botany he refused a paying position at the University, {{because he did not}} want to be diverted from his scientific investigations. The means of his family allowed him not only to subsist comfortably, but to establish an equipped scientific laboratory at home. In this laboratory he started his first investigation on fungi, dealing with the <b>bread</b> <b>mould,</b> Monilia. The work turned out to be very complicated and it became necessary to consult with de Bary.|$|E
50|$|Maturing colonies Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, produce conidial {{anastomosis}} tubes (CATs) between conidia {{before leaving}} the host and before germination, {{in contrast to the}} genetic model fungus Neurospora crassa (<b>bread</b> <b>mould)</b> that produces conidial anastomosis tubes from conidia and conidial germ tubes during germination. Other Colletotrichum species produce conidial anastomosis tubes as well. The initial characterization of CATs was made in this plant pathogen in 2003 by Roca et al. in Brazil. CATs first form 15 days after the start of fruiting body development and grow from the conidia. As they grow, they may either fuse with other CATs, as evidenced by fusion points, or make direct contact with another conidium. Because each conidium creates CATs, the result is a network of conidia all connected together. The CAT network is developed very quickly, often within 1 hour of the first CAT connection. The exact purpose of this connection network is unclear, but it permits free flow of cytoplasm, proteins, organelles and even nuclei between conidia. It is unclear whether these CATs can play a role in genetic recombination, as no sexual stages for C. lindemuthianum has been found in nature.|$|E
5000|$|Johnson’s initial {{foray into}} {{research}} was {{as an undergraduate}} in Menaker’s lab, which {{was working on the}} pineal gland in birds and other chronobiology projects in vertebrates. In graduate school at Stanford under Colin Pittendrigh, Johnson attempted to discover circadian rhythms in a variety of organism such as leeches and cockroaches. He also worked with earthworms to see whether they would completely recover circadian rhythms upon regeneration of lesioned parts of their brains. He also developed a method to measure the pH levels inside cells in search of rhythmic acid/base relationships. However only one of these projects ultimately resulted in a publication, namely a paper about the clock’s control over the pH in the <b>bread</b> <b>mould</b> Neurospora crassa. Johnson switched to David Epel’s marine biology lab [...] in his fourth year of graduate school, because their work on the pH change in sea urchin and starfish eggs upon fertilization was an excellent system in which to apply the method he had developed earlier to measure the pH levels inside cells. He successfully published a number of papers on this topic. In his postdoctoral studies with Hastings, Johnson returned to the biological clocks field and worked mainly on rhythms in the bioluminescent alga Gonyaulax polyedra [...] and later in the algal model system for genetics, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.|$|E
40|$|When used in {{optimized}} proportions, sourdough {{can improve}} volume, texture, flavour, and nutritional value of bread, and {{may increase the}} shelf life by retarding the staling process and protecting <b>bread</b> from <b>mould</b> and bacterial spoilage. In this context, {{the objective of the}} paper is double: a) to verify the influence of different baking procedures adopted by different artisanal bakeries on the sourdough composition and performance; b) to determine whether and how the operating conditions adopted can affect the chemical composition and the sensory characteristics of bread. The preliminary results indicate that chemical composition of sourdough and bread, as well as sensorial expression of corresponding bread, might be greatly influenced by the operating conditions adopted during baking. In particular, when the activity of hetero lactic bacteria was promoted (fermentation ratio FR @ 3. 0), the bread showed the worst sensorial expression in terms of taste and structural characteristics of the crumb...|$|R
40|$|Sourdough is a {{very complex}} {{biological}} system and an important modern fermentation method of cereal flours and water. The use of sourdough process as a form of leavening {{is one of the oldest}} biotechnological processes in food production. Sourdoughs as an ancient way for improve flavour, texture and microbiological shelf life of bread, have been used for thousands of years and are generally regarded as safe. Today, sourdough baking is an alternative to the use of additives. Sourdough fermentation is based on lactic acid and alcoholic fermentation depending on the composition of microflora and fermentation conditions. These factors do not act separately but in an interactive way, adding to the complexity of the system. A common trend of sourdough fermentations is the unique symbiosis of certain hetero and homo fermentative lactic acid bacteria with certain yeasts. Most of the beneficial properties attributed to sourdough are determined by the acidification activity of lactic acid bacteria. Sourdough fermentation creates an optimum pH for the activity of endogenous factors which improve dough properties and texture changes, contributes directly to bread aroma and flavour, increases phytate breakdown, loaf volume and digestibility, delays starch retrogradation, bread firming and staling process, protects <b>bread</b> from <b>mould</b> and bacterial spoilage and probably enhances the human tolerance to gluten. This review focuses on sourdough explanation and its potentials to improve bread shelf life...|$|R

Ergänzend wurden schimmelbefallene Produkte aus Privathaushalten in die Studie miteinbezogen. Die Lagerung von Brotproben erfolgte unter verschiedenen Temperaturbedingungen. Des Weiteren wurden Schmelzkäseproben, die keinen sichtbaren Hinweis auf einen Schimmelbefall aufwiesen, auf eine mögliche Mykotoxinbelastung untersucht. Als Markertoxine für eine Belastung mit Mykotoxinen wurden Fumonisin B 2 (gebildet von Aspergillus niger) sowie Isofumigaclavin A (gebildet von Penicillium roqueforti) herangezogen.

Mould-infested products from private households were also incorporated into the survey. The storage of the bread samples occurred under different temperature conditions like a typical household storage would. Fresh samples of processed cheese which showed no visual evidence of being mould-infested were also tested for a contamination with mycotoxins.

40|$|The results {{presented}} here indicate {{that although the}} actual nutritional components of the Egyptian diet remained constant over the Predynastic and Early Dynastic periods, the methods by which they were processed and consumed differed. Furthermore these results have demonstrated the importance of maintaining an integrated approach to dietary analysis. By comparing the skeletal, dental and isotopic results, {{it is clear that}} the changes in Egyptian diet occurred as a result of processing differences. This means that future dietary research must link the archaeological evidence, such as from changes in fishhook and <b>bread</b> <b>mould</b> morphology, with the actual skeletal evidence. Further research is also required to refine the isotopic analysis as the current comparative material does not all originate from the same sites as the sources for the human remain...|$|E
40|$|A diverse {{array of}} organisms from {{bacteria}} to humans may have evolved the ability to tell time in {{the presence or absence}} of external environmental cues. In the lowly <b>bread</b> <b>mould,</b> Neurospora crassa, biomolecular reactions involving the white-collar- 1 (wc- 1), white-collar- 2 (wc- 2), and frequency (frq) genes and their products constitute building blocks of a biological clock. Here we use genetic network models to explain quantitatively, from a systems perspective, how these building blocks interact, and how a complex trait like clock oscillation emerges from these interactions. We use a recently developed method of genetic network identification to find an ensemble of oscillating network models quantitatively consistent with available RNA and protein profiling data on the N. crassa clock. Predicted key features of the N. crassa clock system are a dynamically frustrated closed feedback loop, cooperativity in frq gene activation, and/or WC- 1 /WC- 2 protein complex deactivation and substantial posttranscriptional enhancement of wc- 1 RNA lifetime. Measuring the wc- 1 mRNA lifetime provides a critical test of the genetic networks...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to compare the {{nutritional}} characteristics of wheat bread with the bread produced of wheat flour supplemented with quinoa and buckwheat seeds. Bread making properties of these blends were analyzed in order to investigate their ability to make <b>moulded</b> <b>bread.</b> Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Will.) and buckwheat seeds were grown {{in the vicinity of}} Belgrade, Serbia. The addition of pseudocereal seeds (at levels of 30 % and 40 %) and a selected technological process, which included hydrothermal preparation of supplements, resulted with a valuable effect on nutritive value of breads. In comparison with the wheat bread that was used as control sample, the protein increase of 2 % and the increase of crude fiber content at around 0. 5 % in 30 % supplemented breads were registered. Furthermore, the incorporation of both seeds mixture at the level of 40 %, increased the content of protein for 2. 5 % and fiber content for 0. 4 %. In regard to the starch, fat, and ash contents there were no major differences. The investigated breads were nutritionally superior to the wheat bread. Chemical composition of the selected seeds was also investigated. The results showed that the blends containing either 30 % or 40 % of selected seeds expressed high potential for the production of molded breads, as new baking products with enhanced nutritional composition. The applied technological procedure was modified in such way that for all blended combination of supplements it changed rheological properties of dough. Furthermore, it resulted in a good volume of breads with excellent sensory properties of aroma-odor and taste...|$|R
40|$|Sourdough is a {{potential}} option to improve bread quality also in wheat baking due to the natural, additive-free image of products containing sourdough. Furthermore, recent results demonstrate the effectiveness of sourdough fermentation in improving the nutritional value of cereal products. During cereal fermentation, typically up to 24 h at moderate temperatures, the metabolic activity of the microorganisms present is in interaction with the grain constituents. Sourdough fermentation can influence the nutritional quality by decreasing or increasing levels of compounds, and enhancing or retarding the bioavailability of nutrients (Poutanen et al., 2009). Sourdough {{is a mixture of}} flour and water fermented with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts, which determine its characteristics in terms of acid production, aroma and leavening (Katina et al., 2006). A slack flour dough is inoculated with microbial starter, “mother culture”, which is constantly renewed in a cyclical way, using specified recipes and ripening conditions. As a consequence, sourdough is a unique food ecosystem: it selects for LAB and yeasts which are adapted to the environment, and hosts highly specific microbial communities (De Vuyst and Vancanneyt, 2007). When used in optimised proportions, sourdough can improve volume, texture, flavour, nutritional value of bread and increase the shelf life by retarding the staling process and by protecting <b>bread</b> from <b>mould</b> and bacterial spoilage (De Vuyst and Vancanneyt, 2007). The changes in cereal matrix potentially leading to improved nutritional quality are numerous. They include acid production, suggested to retard starch digestibility, and to adjust pH to a range which support the action of certain endogenous enzymes, thus changing the bioavailability pattern of minerals and potentially protective compounds in the blood circulation (Katina et al. 2005). The action of enzymes during fermentation also causes hydrolysis and solubilisation of grain macromolecules, such as proteins (i. e. : gluten) and cell wall polysaccharides. It has also been suggested that degradation of gluten may render bread better suitable for celiac persons (Poutanen et al., 2009; Di Cagno et al., 2004). Some of the mechanisms to improve and enhance the nutritional effects of fermented cereal systems are dependent on adjustment of the acidity for optimal action of the enzyme system present. Other mechanisms may be directly linked to other metabolites produced by yeast and lactic acid bacteria, and then the control of different metabolic routes in the fermenting organisms becomes a key issue. (Poutanen et al., 2009; Venturi et al., 2013). Among the typical Tuscan products {{one of the most popular}} is the famous Tuscan bread, a sour dough bread baked in a wood. With the aim to safeguard ‘real’ Tuscan bread and its heritage, some chemical and sensory parameters and/or indexes starting from the results of the analysis of samples of the artisan bakers belonging to “Consorzio Promozione e Tutela del Pane Toscano” were selected to differentiate sour dough Tuscan bread from industrial fresh products.
