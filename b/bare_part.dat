50|$|Bonaparte's gull {{is among}} the {{smallest}} of the gull species; only little gull and Saunders's gull are smaller. Adults range from 28 to 38 cm in length, with a wingspan of 76 - 84 cm and a body mass of 180 - 225 g. There is no difference in plumage or <b>bare</b> <b>part</b> colour between the sexes, though males tend to be heavier than females. Bonaparte's gull is smaller-bodied, smaller-headed, and smaller-billed than the other common hooded gulls of North America. The adult has grey upperparts and white underparts; its wingtips are black above and pale below. In breeding plumage, it has a slaty black hood, which it loses in non-breeding plumage. Its short, thin bill is black, and its legs are orangish-red.|$|E
50|$|Cordyline pumilio is a plant rarely {{exceeding}} 2 m tall. It {{is a very}} narrow-leaved species, {{and does}} not develop into the large tree-like form of C. australis. It often flowers while its short stem is leafy to the ground. In older plants the <b>bare</b> <b>part</b> of stem is up to 1 m long and 1.5 cm (less than an inch) wide, and not usually very erect. The leaves are 30 cm to 1 metre (1-3 ft)long and 1 to 2 cm (up to an inch) wide, and may narrow above the base into a channelled petiole. The midrib is prominent abaxially, or at least proximally and the leaf margins are slightly recurved. The flower spike or panicle appears in November or December and is up to 60 by 30 cm, very open with slender axes, branched to the second order, with small white or bluish-white flowers irregularly scattered along the branches. The bracts are often small and inconspicuous. The tepals are narrow, recurved and have three nerves. The stigma is short and trifid.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{closely related}} western screech owl (Megascops kennicottii), {{there are not}} [...] "morphs", as all owls of the western species are gray. Besides coloration, the western screech owl is of {{almost exactly the same}} general {{appearance}} and size as the eastern. The only reliable distinguishing features are the bill color, which is considerably darker (often a black-gray) in the western and olive-yellow in the eastern, and their different voices. The eastern and western screech owls overlap in the range in the Rio Grande valley at the Texas-Mexico border and the riparian woods of the Cimarron tributary of the Arkansas River on the edge of southern Great Plains. Other somewhat similar species that may abut the eastern screech owl's range in its western and southernmost distribution, like the Middle American screech owl (Megascops guatemalae; formerly called [...] "vermiculated screech owl"), whiskered screech owl (Megascops trichopsis) and the flammulated owl (Psiloscops flammeolus), are distinguished by their increasingly smaller body and foot size, different streaking pattern on breast (bolder on the whiskered, weaker on the others), different <b>bare</b> <b>part</b> coloration, and distinctive voices. Through much of the eastern United States, eastern screech owls are essentially physically unmistakable, because other owls with ear tufts are much larger and different colored and the only other small owl, the northern saw-whet owl (Aegolius acadius) is even smaller, with no ear tufts, a more defined facial disc, and browner overall color.|$|E

5000|$|Jovan [...] "Jovo" [...] Stanisavljević (Јовaн [...] "Јово" [...] Станисављевић; 1897-27 February 1925), {{known by}} his {{nickname}} Čaruga (Чаруга), was an outlaw (hajduk) in Slavonia {{in the early}} 20th century. Stanisavljević was born in 1897, into a Serb Orthodox family {{in the village of}} Slavonske <b>Bare</b> (<b>part</b> of Zdenci) in the Virovitica County, autonomous Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Austro-Hungary. He was named after his paternal grandfather Jovan, who went by the family nickname of Čaruga ("troublemaker"). His father Prokopija was a peasant, and his mother Ika died when he was ten. His father remarried, and he had a tough upbringing, later running away from home to Osijek, where he went to a locksmith school. When World War I broke out, he stopped his studies and enrolled in the Austro-Hungarian Army. However, he posed as an officer and deserted the front lines. Shortly afterwards, he killed a man who was courting his girlfriend, and after a local nobleman threatened to arrest him, he killed him too. He was eventually apprehended, tried, and convicted, and started serving his sentence in the Sremska Mitrovica penitentiary. He managed to escape from prison and had a warrant for his capture, returning home where he was unwelcomed. Čaruga left for the woods, where he befriended a gang, Kolo gorskih tića ("Band of Mountain Birds"), composed mostly of deserters, who all detested the rich Slavonian peasants and robbed them mercilessly, and were not afraid of killing people. He used the false names Nikola Drezgić and Mile Barić. The war was long over, but Čaruga and the gang were still pillaging the countryside, and became hunted by the Yugoslav gendarmerie. Eventually in 1922 he decided to leave for Zagreb, where he posed as a rich gentleman from Vinkovci and also continued his life of thievery. He would later return to Slavonia to continue stealing together with his group members. On 14 October 1923, however, they attempted to rob the Eltz family estate in Ivankovo near Vinkovci. They killed a man on site, while another snuck out and called the gendarmerie. After the skirmish that ensued they managed to escape but without their loot. More importantly, the police got on their trail and soon captured them. By February 1925, Čaruga's trial at the court in Osijek was finished, and he was subsequently hanged in front of a crowd of 3,000.|$|E

40|$|Birds show {{striking}} interspecific {{variation in}} their use of carotenoid-based coloration. Theory predicts that the use of carotenoids for coloration is closely associated with the availability of carotenoids in the diet but, although this prediction has been supported in single-species studies and those using small numbers of closely related species, there have been no broad-scale quantitative tests of the link between carotenoid coloration and diet. Here we test for such a link using modern comparative methods, a database on 140 families of birds and two alternative avian phylogenies. We show that carotenoid pigmentation is more common in the bare parts (legs, bill and skin) than in plumage, and that yellow coloration is more common than red. We also show that there is no simple, general association between the availability of carotenoids in the diet and the overall use of carotenoid-based coloration. However, when we look at plumage coloration separately from <b>bare</b> <b>part</b> coloration, we find there is a robust and significant association between diet and plumage coloration, but not between diet and <b>bare</b> <b>part</b> coloration. Similarly, when we look at yellow and red plumage colours separately, we find that the association between diet and coloration is typically stronger for red coloration than it is for yellow coloration. Finally, when we build multivariate models to explain variation in each type of carotenoid-based coloration we find that a variety of life history and ecological factors are associated with different aspects of coloration, with dietary carotenoids only being a consistent significant factor in the case of variation in plumage. All of these results remain qualitatively unchanged irrespective of the phylogeny used in the analyses, although in some cases the precise life history and ecological variables included in the multivariate models do vary. Taken together, these results indicate that the predicted link between carotenoid coloration and diet is idiosyncratic rather than general, being strongest with respect to plumage colours and weakest for <b>bare</b> <b>part</b> coloration. We therefore suggest that, although the carotenoid-based bird plumage may a good model for diet-mediated signalling, the use of carotenoids in <b>bare</b> <b>part</b> pigmentation may have a very different functional basis and may be more strongly influenced by genetic and physiological mechanisms, which currently remain relatively understudied...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} optical model (OM) {{analysis}} of the elastic scattering data of the reactions 6 He+ 27 Al and 6 He+ 208 Pb at incident energies around the Coulomb barrier. The <b>bare</b> <b>part</b> of the optical potential is constructed microscopically {{by means of a}} double folding procedure, using the Sao Paulo prescription without any renormalization. This bare interaction is supplemented with a Coulomb dipole polarization (CDP) potential, which takes into account the effect of the dipole Coulomb interaction. For this CDP potential, we use an analytical formula derived from the semiclassical theory of Coulomb excitation. The rest of the optical potential is parametrized in terms of Woods-Saxon shapes. In the 6 He+ 208 Pb case, the analysis confirms the presence of long range components, in agreement with previous works. Four-body Continuum-Discretized Coupled-Channels calculations have been performed in order to better understand the features of the optical potentials found in the OM analysis. This study searches to elucidate some aspects of the optical potential of weakly bound systems, such as the dispersion relation and the long range (attractive and absorptive) mechanisms.
