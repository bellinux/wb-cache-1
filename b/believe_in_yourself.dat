In a January 2007 interview with The Bulletin, Barnes spoke passionately about Australian rock musicians saying: [...] "Australian bands for me {{will always have}} the grunt. Grunt is what gives you longevity, strength, the power to <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>yourself.</b> We have great bands here because they play live, they cut their teeth playing to people.". In March 2008, Barnes appeared as a special guest during soul singer Guy Sebastian's tour.|$|E

In 2007, skeptics observed that Geller appeared to have dropped his claims that he does not perform magic tricks. Randi highlighted a quotation from the November 2007 issue of the magazine Magische Welt (Magic World) in which Geller said: [...] "I'll no longer say that I have supernatural powers. I am an entertainer. I want to do a good show. My entire character has changed." [...] In a later interview, Geller told Telepolis, [...] "I said to this German magazine, so what I did say, that I changed my character, {{to the best of my}} recollection, and I no longer say that I do supernatural things. It doesn't mean that I don't have powers. It means that I don't say 'it's supernatural', I say 'I'm a mystifier!' That's what I said. And the skeptics turned it around and said, 'Uri Geller said he's a magician!' I never said that." [...] In that interview, Geller further explained that when he is asked how he does his stunts, he tells children to [...] "Forget the paranormal. Forget spoon bending! Instead of that, focus on school! Become a positive thinker! <b>Believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>yourself</b> and create a target! Go to university! Never smoke! And never touch drugs!

2500|$|Sandé {{said the}} key to a {{successful}} song was simplicity. The singer pointed out that she could never have used songs which she wrote when she was 17 because she made the songs too complicated; saying there were too many words and parts to the track. She stated that the key feature to a classical song was keeping the [...] "melody simple" [...] and having big [...] "lyric effective", which was much easier said than actually done. Sandé said that another important key to a good song when songwriting is using [...] "honesty" [...] and [...] "raw emotion" [...] as the best way to write. She said that if she attempts to write something which is [...] "too smart" [...] the creative process will not work for her. [...] "Kill the Boy" [...] {{was one of the first}} ideas that came to Sandé's head. If she has to work on a song longer than a day, she will not go back to it because it won't work. She went on to say if it was to work, the idea for the song would be almost instant. Sandé said that all her songs are about world peace and political issues. She is the same person since gaining the record deal with Virgin Records, and they are the same songs which she planned for the album before gaining the deal. She said that a lot of people didn't see the potential in the songs or in her, but once she gained the record deal, she gained more confidence. [...] "When you get knocked back so much you kind of learn to <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>yourself,</b> stand up for yourself, because you can bet that nobody else is going to do it." ...|$|E

I heard a human laugh come from that direction. In the casting of that bottle the Celebrity had given vent to some of the feelings he had been collecting overnight, and it must have carried about thirty yards.
