5|$|In the 1970s, the anti-terrorism {{industry}} offered bullet-proof vehicles, bugging {{devices and}} security hardware, so Mardas set up companies offering these products to VIPs. King Hussein of Jordan bought {{a fleet of}} cars that Mardas had customised, but then reportedly had the changes reversed when tests demonstrated them to <b>be</b> <b>useless.</b> In 1987, Mardas was a managing director of Alcom Ltd, which specialised in electronic communications and security. He later returned to Greece.|$|E
5|$|King Matthias' all {{attempts}} to secure his son's succession to the throne proved to <b>be</b> <b>useless</b> shortly after his death. The prelates and the barons elected Vladislaus II Jagiellon king on 15 July 1490. He retained his domains and the Duchy of Troppau. The new monarch bestowed the title of Duke of Slavonia upon him, but he renounced of it in 1495. He also renounced of the Duchy of Troppau in 1501.|$|E
5|$|Salinger then accompanies Wexler to Istanbul, where Skarssen {{is buying}} the crucial {{components}} from their only other manufacturer.

Both Wexler and Skarssen are then killed by a hitman contracted by Enzo and Mario Calvini to avenge their father's murder by the bank. Salinger is left stunned, his investigation, pursuit, and determination to bring down the IBBC, have led him to nothing.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in April, Breckinridge made daily {{visits to}} an ailing Henry Clay. Clay died June 29, 1852, and Breckinridge {{garnered}} nationwide praise and enhanced popularity in Kentucky after eulogizing Clay in the House. Days later, {{he spoke in}} opposition to increasing a subsidy to the Collins Line for carrying trans-Atlantic mail, noting that Collins profited by carrying passengers and cargo on mail ships. In wartime, the government could commandeer and retrofit Collins's steamboats as warships, but Breckinridge cited Commodore Matthew C. Perry's opinion that they would <b>be</b> <b>useless</b> in war. Finally, he showed Cornelius Vanderbilt's written statement promising to build a fleet of mail ships at his expense and carry the mail for $4 million less than Collins. Despite this, the House approved the subsidy increase.|$|E
5|$|From 27 May to 4 July, Wettin {{was back}} in the North Sea, patrolling the mouths of the Jade, Ems, and Elbe rivers. During this period, the naval high command {{realized}} that the old Wittelsbach-class ships would <b>be</b> <b>useless</b> in action against the Royal Navy, but could be effectively used against the much weaker Russian forces in the Baltic. As a result, the ships were transferred back to the Baltic in July, and they departed Kiel on the 7th, bound for Danzig. On 10 July, the ships proceeded further east to Neufahrwassar, along with the VIII Torpedo-boat Flotilla. The IV Squadron ships sortied on 12 July to make a demonstration, returning to Danzig on 21 July without encountering Russian forces.|$|E
5|$|Mineral {{resources}} {{near the}} top end of the canal included ironstone, which was normally extracted by scouring. This caused problems for the canal, as silt was deposited in the feeders and the top pounds. The Fox family, who were based at Neath Abbey, but who were scouring ironstone further up the valley, agreed to construct a new feeder in 1807 to mitigate the problem. Protests made to the Tappendens, who were scouring at Pen-rhiw and Cwm Gwrelych, were less successful. As the pounds were silting up, the company took legal action in 1811. The court found in their favour, recognising that the canal would soon <b>be</b> <b>useless</b> unless something was done.|$|E

5|$|Preceding the Vietnam War {{the high}} speeds {{aircraft}} were attaining {{led to a}} move to remove the cannon due to the mistaken belief that they would <b>be</b> <b>useless</b> in a dogfight, but combat experience during the Vietnam War showed conclusively that despite advances in missiles, {{there was still a}} need for them. Nearly all modern fighter aircraft are armed with an autocannon and they are also commonly found on ground-attack aircraft. One of the most powerful examples is the 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger Gatling-type rotary cannon, mounted exclusively on the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II. The Lockheed AC-130 gunship (a converted transport) can carry a 105mm howitzer as well as a variety of autocannons ranging up to 40mm. Both are used in the close air support role.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson {{family are}} busy {{preparing}} for Bart's birthday party. Homer sees a commercial on television for a prank microphone called the Superstar Celebrity Microphone {{that can be}} used to tap into localized AM radio systems and instantly decides to buy one for Bart. Subsequently, Bart experiences a crushingly disappointing birthday party when all his gifts turn out to <b>be</b> <b>useless</b> things like a cactus, a label maker, and a new suit. At first, he is also disappointed by the microphone, but later finds a use for it in creating practical jokes, such as tricking Ned's boys Rod and Todd into believing that God is talking to them, listening in on Lisa and Janey's conversations about boys, and persuading Homer that Martians are invading the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{occurred}} during Holy Week, 1799, amid rain and dense fog. Initially, the French {{were able to}} take, and hold, Ostrach and the nearby hamlet of Hoßkirch plus several strategic points on the Ostrach marsh. As the engagement began, Habsburg numerical superiority overwhelmed French defenses. By evening, the French left wing was flanked and Jourdan's men retreated from Ostrach to the Pfullendorf heights. On the next morning, as Jourdan considered a counter-attack, the weather broke, and he could {{look down on the}} Austrian battle array. The numbers and dispositions of the Austrians convinced him that any attack would <b>be</b> <b>useless,</b> and that he could not hope to maintain his position in the heights. As he withdrew, a portion of his right flank was cut off from the main force.|$|E

5|$|With {{the units}} in the rear, the only {{communications}} method was via the intercom. Contemporary systems used the radio as the intercom as well, but the TR9D sets used in RAF aircraft used the voice channel for 15 seconds every minute for the pip-squeak system, blocking communications. Even when modified sets were supplied that addressed this, the radar was found to interfere strongly with the intercom. A speaking tube was tried but found to <b>be</b> <b>useless.</b> Newer VHF radios being developed through this same period did not suffer these problems, and the Blenheims were moved {{to the front of}} the queue to receive these units.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 51 {{provides}} {{a detailed account}} of Ragnarök interspersed with various quotes from Völuspá, while chapters 52 and 53 describe the aftermath of these events. In Chapter 51, High states that the first sign of Ragnarök will be Fimbulwinter, during which time three winters will arrive without a summer, and the sun will <b>be</b> <b>useless.</b> High details that, prior to these winters, three earlier winters will have occurred, marked with great battles throughout the world. During this time, greed will cause brothers to kill brothers, and fathers and sons will suffer from the collapse of kinship bonds. High then quotes stanza 45 of Völuspá. Next, High describes that the wolf will swallow the sun, then his brother will swallow the moon, and mankind will consider the occurrence as a great disaster resulting in much ruin. The stars will disappear. The earth and mountains will shake so violently that the trees will come loose from the soil, the mountains will topple, and all restraints will break, causing Fenrir to break free from his bonds.|$|E

She was able to free herself and was not damaged in the incident, and the following day Schmidt returned to the ship. The IV Squadron ships sortied on 12 July to make a demonstration, returning to Danzig on 21 July without encountering Russian forces.|$|E

5|$|Kotzer {{estimated}} that a frontal assault against the Egyptians would <b>be</b> <b>useless,</b> {{as they were}} dug in {{on both sides of}} the pillbox. In complete darkness, the 1st Company made its way south through the wadi hoping to avoid enemy fire from superior positions and weapons until they were close enough to respond. At 03:00, the Israeli artillery barrage started, but did not do significant damage and only alerted all Egyptian positions to the Israeli presence. The only Israeli unit close to engagement at the time was Kotzer's company. About 100 m away from the Egyptian defense line, they stepped into an ambush and the leading squad was eliminated. Kotzer ordered the machine gunners to climb to the east bank of the wadi to provide cover for a counterattack, and this move also led to Israeli casualties. The counterattack was difficult and only destroyed some small Egyptian entrenchments.|$|E
