Aim Tracking {{the migration of}} Red-spotted <b>Bluethroats</b> from Europe to the hitherto unknown non-breeding areas and back. Methods Light-level geolocators were deployed on male <b>Bluethroats</b> at breeding sites in the Czech Republic (n[*]=[*] 10) and in Norway (n[*]=[*] 30). Recorded light intensity data were used to estimate the locations of non-breeding sites and migration phenology during the annual cycle. Results <b>Bluethroats</b> spent the boreal winter in India (n[*]=[*] 3) and Pakistan (n[*]=[*] 1), on average more than 6000  km from their breeding areas. Autumn migration started in August (n[*]=[*] 1) or early September (n[*]=[*] 2), and lasted for 26 – 74 days. Spring migration commenced on 8 and 9 April (n[*]=[*] 2) and lasted for about a month. During both autumn and spring migration, birds stopped over {{two or three times}} for more than 3 days.

40|$|The post-breeding moult and fat {{deposition}} of adult male <b>bluethroats,</b> Luscinia svecica, were studied in captivity. One group (Control group) was held under light conditions simulating the natural light regime of their moulting grounds at 66 °N latitude. The light regime of another group (Shifted group) {{was similar to}} the Control group, but shifted 1 month forward, simulating light conditions further into autumn. All birds had food ad libitum. In addition, comparisons were made with free-living <b>bluethroats.</b> There were no differences in moult performance (start and speed) between the Control group and the Shifted group, and moult was similar to that of free-living birds. The start of moult may be endogenously controlled and set earlier in the season so the change in light regime for the Shifted group may have come too late to influence moult performance. The rate of moult may also be inflexible, in spite of the imposed time stress. In addition, <b>bluethroats</b> may moult so fast that further acceleration would hamper flight manoeuvrability and feeding efficiency. Whereas the Control group birds first started to deposit fat when moult was finished, as free-living birds do, the Shifted group birds started fat deposition in mid-moult. Also, the fat deposition rate following completion of moult was higher in the Shifted group. Thus, adult <b>bluethroats</b> can adjust the timing and speed of fat deposition in relation to moult and time of season. Such flexibility should be advantageous for migratory birds moulting at high latitudes where time available between breeding and migration is short. ...|$|R

40|$|Many birds {{see in the}} {{ultraviolet}} (300 – 400 nm), but there is limited evidence for colour communication (signalling by spectral shape independently of brightness) in this 'hidden' waveband. Such data are critical for the understanding of extravagant plumage colours, some of which show considerable UV reflectance. We investigated UV colour vision in female social responses to the male UV/violet ornament in <b>bluethroats,</b> Luscinia s. svecica. In an outdoor aviary at the breeding grounds, 16 females were each presented with a unique pair of males of equal age. In UVR (UV reduction) males, sunblock chemicals reduced only the UV reflectance and thereby the spectral shape (colour) of the throat ornament. In NR (neutral reduction) males, an achromatic pigment in the same base solvent (preen gland fat) was used for a corresponding but uniform brightness reduction. Both colour and brightness effects were invisible to human eyes, and were monitored by spectrometry. In 13 of the 16 trials, the female associated most with the NR male, a preference that implies that UV colour vision is used in mate choice by female <b>bluethroats.</b> Reflectance differences between one-year-old and older males were significant only in UV, suggestive of a UV colour cue in age-related mate preferences...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} importance of prior occupancy and of asymmetries in both value of winning and in resource-holding potential for the outcome of animal contests was tested. <b>Bluethroats,</b> Luscinia s. svecica, were offered food ad libitum in the field. Prior to migration, at a moulting site, their weight increased rapidly and peaked after a few days. Lean birds won significantly more interactions than fat birds, probably owing to higher motivation {{to fight for the}} food. Dominance between individuals shifted and was not correlated with size or prior occupancy. During the subsequent migration, at a stopover site, the <b>bluethroats</b> gained weight throughout their stay. Dominance between individuals was constant and positively correlated with size, whereas fat reserves and prior occupancy had no effect on contest resolution. Fat deposition rates were positively correlated with dominance status. The different dominance patterns are explained in terms of different gain curves of fat for birds putting on fat for survival and migration, respectively. Though prior occupancy had no general effect on dominance patterns, such an uncorrelated asymmetry may have been used to settle single contests between fat birds at the moulting site. The fact that dominance (acting through differences in size) influences fat deposition rates may be important for the spatial and temporal pattern of migration in birds that compete for resources at stopover sites...|$|R

Studies have shown that among some monogamous herbivorous animals, particularly zebras, females will seek out copulation or interim entanglements with other zebras who they find more attractive.

40|$|Female {{ornaments}} {{in animals}} with conventional sex roles {{have traditionally been}} considered non-functional, being merely a genetically correlated response to selection for male ornamentation.

We tested the latter hypothesis in mate choice experiments with <b>bluethroats</b> (Luscinia s. svecica), a passerine bird in which females vary considerably in coloration of an ornamental throat patch. In outdoor aviaries placed in prime breeding habitat, males were allowed to choose between a colourful and a drab female. We found that males associated more with, and performed more sexual behaviours towards, colourful females. Female coloration was not age-related, but correlated significantly with body mass and tarsus length. Thus, we have demonstrated both a male preference for female ornamentation, and a relationship between ornament expression and female body size, which may be indicative of quality. Our results refute the correlated response hypothesis and support the hypothesis that female ornamentation is sexually selected...|$|R

40|$|The blue throat {{feathers}} of male <b>bluethroats</b> (Luscinia s. svecica) show a reflectance {{peak in the}} ultraviolet (UV) waveband (320 to 400 nm).

Indeed, a recent aviary experiment demonstrated that females discriminated against males with artificially reduced UV reflectance (Andersson and Amundsen 1997). Here, we report {{the results of a}} similar experimental manipulation applied on free-ranging males. UV-reduced (UVR) males had a lower success in attracting mates, as judged from a significantly later start of egg laying, compared with control (C) males. UVR males also spent significantly less time advertising for additional mates when their own mate was fertile, and they had a lower success in achieving extra-pair fertilizations. Furthermore, UVR males tended to guard their mates more closely and lose more paternity in their own brood than C males did. We conclude that the treatment affected both social and extra-pair mate choice. This is the first experimental evidence that UV signalling influences male mating success in free-ranging birds...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 86 adult <b>bluethroats</b> (Luscinia svecica) from nine {{different}} localities, covering {{the full length}} of the Fennoscandian mountain range, were screened for blood parasites of the three genera Haemoproteus, Plasmodium and Leucocytozoon using a recently developed polymerase chain reaction method.

Of the infected birds, 15. 1 % carried mixed infections. Five different mitochondrial DNA-lineages of Leucocytozoon spp., eight lineages of Plasmodium spp. and one lineage of Haemoproteus spp. were found.

The occurrence of the second most common lineage of Leucocytozoon spp. showed significant variation in prevalence between sites.

40|$|Breeding site {{fidelity}} can {{be determined}} by environmental features, which depending on their heterogeneous distribution may shape the genetic landscape of a population. We used 10 microsatellite loci to study the genetic variation of 83 <b>bluethroats</b> (Luscinia svecica azuricollis) across 14 localities within the Spanish breeding population and assess the relative influence of different habitat characteristics (physiography and vegetation) on genetic differentiation. Based on the genetic variation of this population, we identified 3 geographically consistent genetic clusters that on average showed a higher genetic differentiation than among other north European populations, even those belonging to different subspecies. The inferred genetic clusters occurred in geographic areas that significantly differed in elevation. The highest genetic differentiation was observed between sites at different mountain ranges, {{as well as between}} the highest altitude sites in the northeastern locale, whereas vegetation type did not explain a significant percentage of genetic variation. The lack of correlation between geographic and genetic distances suggests that this pattern of genetic structure cannot be explained as a consequence of isolation by distance.

40|$|Sperm {{cells are}} the most {{variable}} animal cells, and a tremendous variation in sperm phenotypes exists among species, from minute amoeboid sperm to giant sperm in some species of fruit flies. Much effort {{has been devoted to}} the study of sperm evolution. Sperm competition, when sperm from two or more males compete over fertilization of a set of ova, is thought to be the major force driving the evolution of sperm. There are several ways in which sperm competition can effect the evolution of sperm traits, e. g. through increased sperm production, sperm motility and size. This thesis concerns variation among and function of sperm in passerine birds. At three levels, within males, between males of the same species and between males of different species, co-workers and I have studied variation in sperm morphology and motility of selected species of passerine birds. Sperm traits, such as sperm numbers, sperm size and sperm motility are potentially important for male fertilization success. Hence, sperm traits are expected to be under strong selection due to evolutionary forces such as e. g. sperm competition. Thus, it is surprising how scarce the available information on sperm traits (size, variation, motility) is in passerine birds. In an intraspecific study on <b>bluethroats</b> Luscinia svecica, we found that primary sexual characters, but not sperm size or motility, were age-dependent. These results suggest that increased sperm production in older males can help explain the age-dependent patterns in fertilization success observed in this species. Further, we documented that between-male variation in sperm size is higher than within-male in <b>bluethroats</b> and willow warblers Phylloscopus trochilus, and through resampling procedures we suggested appropriate sample sizes for spermatozoa measured per male and number of males that should be sampled to obtain precise estimates of sperm size and sperm size variation. Moreover, we found that variation in sperm size is closely and negatively related to risk of sperm competition, in a comparative analysis of 22 passerine species. Our interpretation of these results is that increased risk of sperm competition leads to stabilizing selection on sperm size. In another comparative study on 42 passerine species, we documented that sperm swimming speed and sperm length is positively related to risk of sperm competition. However, we found no relationship between sperm swimming speed and sperm size. Thus, it seems that sperm competition leads to both increased sperm swimming speed and increased sperm length, independent of each other. In addition, sperm swimming speed was negatively related to clutch size, a proxy for female sperm storage. Finally, we found in an intraspecific study on tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor, that both sperm quantity and quality were significantly related to fertilization success. This result has great implications as the first study linking sperm traits and fertilization success in a free living passerine...|$|R
40|$|Many {{bird species}} host several {{lineages}} of apicomplexan blood parasites (Protista spp., Haemosporida spp.), {{some of which}} are shared across different host species. To understand such complex systems, it is essential to consider the fact that different lineages, species, and families of parasites can occur in the same population, {{as well as in the}} same individual bird, and that these parasites may compete or interact with each other. In this study, we present a new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol that, for the first time, enables simultaneous typing of species from the 3 most common avian blood parasite genera (Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, and Leucocytozoon). By combining the high detection rate of a nested PCR with another PCR step to separate species of Plasmodium and Haemoproteus from Leucocytozoon, this procedure provides an easy, rapid, and accurate method to separate and investigate these parasites within a blood sample. We have applied this method to bird species with known infections of Leucocytozoon spp., Plasmodium spp., and Haemoproteus spp. To obtain a higher number of parasite lineages and to test the repeatability of the method, we also applied it to blood samples from <b>bluethroats</b> (Luscinia svecica), for which we had no prior knowledge regarding the blood parasite infections. Although only a small number of different bird species were investigated (6 passerine species), we found 22 different parasite species lineages (4 Haemoproteus, 8 Plasmodium, and 10 Leucocytozoon) ...|$|R
40|$|Lindstrom & Alerstam (1992 Am. Nat. 140, 477 - 491) {{presented}} {{a model that}} predicts optimal departure fuel loads {{as a function of}} the rate of fuel deposition in time-minimizing migrants. The basis of the model is that the coverable distance per unit of fuel deposited, diminishes with increasing fuel load. This is an effect of the increasing flight costs associated with increasing body mass. Lindstrom & Alerstam (1992) found that birds left at lower fuel loads than their model predicted for which they considered various ecological explanations. Alternatively, we hypothesize that the difference between prediction and empirical data might be a result of extra resting metabolic and transport costs associated with an increase in fuel load during stopover. We develop a new version of the Lindstrom & Alerstam (1992) model taking fuel load associated costs during stopover into account. We fit empirical data from rufous hummingbirds Selasphorus rufus (Carpenter el al., 1983 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

40|$|International audienceDivergent sexual {{selection}} within allopatric populations {{may result in}} divergent sexual phenotypes, which can act as reproductive barriers between populations upon secondary contact. This hypothesis has been most tested on traits involved in precopulatory {{sexual selection}}, with less work focusing on traits that act after copulation and before fertilization (i. e., postcopulatory prezygotic traits), particularly in internally fertilizing vertebrates. However, postcopulatory sexual selection within species can also drive trait divergence, resulting in reduced performance of heterospecific sperm within the female reproductive tract. Such incompatibilities, arising as a by-product of divergent postcopulatory sexual selection in allopatry, can represent reproductive barriers, analogous to species-assortative mating preferences. Here, we tested for postcopulatory prezygotic reproductive barriers between three pairs of taxa with diverged sperm phenotypes and moderate-to-high opportunity for postcopulatory sexual selection (barn swallows Hirundo rustica versus sand martins Riparia riparia, two subspecies of <b>bluethroats,</b> Luscinia svecica svecica versus L. s. namnetum, and great tits Parus major versus blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus). We tested sperm swimming performance in fluid from the outer reproductive tract of females, because the greatest reduction in sperm number in birds occurs as sperm swim across the vagina. Contrary to our expectations, sperm swam equally well in fluid from conspecific and heterospecific females, suggesting that postcopulatory prezygotic barriers do not act between these taxon pairs, at this stage between copulation and fertilization. We therefore suggest that divergence in sperm phenotypes in allopatry is insufficient to cause widespread postcopulatory prezygotic barriers {{in the form of}} impaired sperm swimming performance in passerine birds...|$|R
