500|$|During {{the opening}} days of March 2015, a major {{westerly}} wind burst occurred, which subsequently {{contributed to the}} development of the [...] 2014-16 El Nino event and the development of twin tropical cyclones in the Pacific Ocean on both sides of the equator. [...] The first tropical cyclone became Severe Tropical Cyclone Pam within the South Pacific Ocean and directly affected the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and New Zealand. The second tropical cyclone was first noted by the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) as a tropical disturbance during March 8, while it was located about [...] to the southeast of Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The disturbance consisted of a large area of atmospheric convection, which was starting to wrap into the system's developing low level circulation centre. The disturbance was also thought to be in a favourable environment for further development at this time, with low vertical wind shear and a good outflow towards the equator. Over the next couple of days the system moved north-westwards through the Marshall Islands and into an marginal environment for further development, with moderate vertical wind shear being partially offset by the system's outflow. During March 10, the Japan Meteorological Agency subsequently started monitoring the disturbance as a tropical depression, while it was located about [...] to the northeast of <b>Bairiki</b> in Kiribati.|$|E

50|$|Bikeman Island is a {{submerged}} islet about a half-hour's canoe ride Northeast of Betio, Kiribati.

If one were to stand on Bikeman today, the water would reach up to one's knees. A picture of Bikeman circa 1976 is available on Flickr.|$|E
50|$|Around 12:30 {{a message}} arrived {{that some of}} the {{defenders}} were making their way across the sandbars from the extreme eastern end of the islet to <b>Bairiki,</b> the next islet over. Portions of the 6th Marine Regiment were then ordered to land on <b>Bairiki</b> to seal off the retreat path. They formed up, including tanks and pack artillery, and were able to start their landings at 16:55. They received machine gun fire, so aircraft were sent in to try to locate the guns and suppress them. The force landed with no further fire, and it was later found that only a single pillbox with 12 machine guns had been set up by the forces that had been assumed to be escaping. They had a small tank of gasoline in their pillbox, and when it was hit with fire from the aircraft the entire force was burned. Later, other units of the 6th were landed unopposed on Green Beach, north (near Red Beach 1).|$|E
50|$|Another Scout-Sniper Platoon {{from the}} 8th Marines {{assisted}} in the main assault landing on D-Day, while the Company D (Scouts), 2nd Tank Battalion worked extensively in the seizure and occupation of other islands in the Tarawa Atoll.

Due to changing currents resulting from the construction of the causeway Bikeman Island, northeast of Betio, has been submerged since the early 1990s.|$|E
