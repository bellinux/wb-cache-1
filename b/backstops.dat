During World War I, the Parade Ground was used to train soldiers. Eight tennis courts opened in 1914 with admission being $1 per person, and owing to the Van Cortlandt Golf Course's immense popularity, the Mosholu Links also opened that year. By 1917, the Parade Ground contained 10 out of the park's baseball diamonds. The park's recreational facilities were quite popular, with more than 10,000 people using them on a busy day. However, during and following World War I, the Parade Ground was used for war training. Until 1926, the baseball fields did not contain <b>backstops,</b> and had to be vacated by July 4 of every year, so the National Guard could use the field.|$|E

2500|$|Shibe scion Jack briefly {{tried his}} hand as a boxing {{promoter}} in the early 1910s, shortly after his father built Shibe Park, and {{although he did not}} pursue the career, he did make the acquaintance of other promoters in the Philadelphia boxing world, including Bob Gunnis and Herman [...] "Muggsy" [...] Taylor. Gunnis and Taylor became among the first promoters to book a bout into a major league baseball stadium when they brought Johnny Dundee vs. George Chaney to Shibe Park in July 1917, and although the fight itself was unremarkable, the concept propelled Gunnis and Taylor to the forefront of their trade. Over the next forty years, perhaps a hundred boxing cards took place at Shibe, some of them big-time pairings and even championship bouts. Benny Leonard retained his championship against challenger Johnny Kilbane in 1917, and 1928's Benny Bass vs. Harry Blitman was said by sportswriters to be the best featherweight bout in the city's history. In the 1950s, Gil Turner, Ike Williams, Charley Fusari and many other top fighters fought important bouts at Shibe Park. At first, groundskeepers set the ring up over the pitcher's mound, but soon this changed to the area over home plate with the baseball <b>backstops</b> dismantled; spectators sat in the main grandstand for the fight. Even before the installation of the light towers in 1939, staging night boxing was easy because of the vastly smaller area that needed to be lit –portable searchlights did the trick.|$|E
2500|$|The second tornado {{touched down}} {{fifteen minutes later}} than its {{predecessor}} near the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, where it lifted a 23-foot (7m) trailer and an automobile. It moved inland over central Florida and closely paralleled {{the path of the}} more powerful first tornado. It crossed Winter Haven, passed near Rockledge, and lifted near the Merritt Island area in Brevard County. Total damages reached $50–100,000, and no deaths occurred. The funnel remained aloft for most of its life span, and maximum damage was typical of a F3 tornado. Fifteen homes were dismantled in Lakeland, while homes and businesses were demolished in northern Winter Haven. Warehouses were leveled south of Haines City, while Citrus trees and trailers were impacted near Auburndale. In the Cocoa Beach area, 150 trailers were destroyed, resulting in more than 100 injuries. 20–23 frame structures and a shopping center were also demolished. Additionally, the tornado struck the training site for the Houston Astros in nearby Cocoa, ripping four light standards from the ground, flattening the center field fence, and destroying all the <b>backstops</b> and batting cages. One of the cages was thrown more than [...] into nearby woods. 140 people were injured by the tornado; the majority of the injuries occurred in Brevard County, where 133 people were transported to a hospital in Cocoa Beach. Widespread looting was reported in some localized areas after the passage of the tornadoes in Hillsborough and Polk counties; a total of 200 National Guardsmen were deployed to the two counties, while lesser numbers were ordered to the city of Cocoa. Damage in the Lakeland area was compared to the aftermath of the Normandy invasion during World War II.|$|E
40|$|Hotelling's {{conceptual}} framework is expanded {{to incorporate the}} effects of a <b>backstop</b> technology on the planning horizon of the suppliers of an exhaustible resource and its price and quantity trajectories. It is shown that in the non-trivial case, the presence of a <b>backstop</b> technology shortens the planning horizon of the suppliers of the exhaustible resource in accordance with the resource suppliers' rate of time preference, <b>backstop</b> technology's rate of irnprovement and ratio of the initial resource spot price to the initial average production cost of the <b>backstop</b> substitute. As expected the presence of a <b>backstop</b> technology also lowers the spot prices of the exhaustible resource and accelerates its extraction and depletion.

If firms face even {{a small amount of}} uncertainty regarding their rivals' stocks, a <b>backstop</b> technology is sufficient to restore existence of competitive equilibrium, even if the <b>backstop</b> price is very high.

40|$|Heal's theorem {{states that}} if the {{extraction}} cost of a depletable resource increases with cumulative extraction, and if a <b>backstop</b> technology exists, the user cost of the depletable resource declines to zero at the date of exhaustion. In this paper, we first present a simple method for proving this proposition, using a social planning model that determines the optimal rates both of extrac-tion of the depletable resource and of production of the <b>backstop</b> technology.

40|$|AbstractTo {{reveal the}} origin of a <b>backstop</b> and its {{influence}} {{on the evolution of}} the accretionary prism, we analyzed reflection seismic data acquired in the Nankai Trough off the Kii Peninsula. The deformation features of the forearc basin sequence show that the landward accretionary prism close to the coast was not deformed after the development of the forearc basin about 2 – 4 Ma. The surface of the landward prism can be identified as strong amplitude reflector, indicating that the landward prism has higher seismic velocity. Therefore, the landward accretionary prism inferred to be of higher strength constitutes a static <b>backstop.</b> Based on seismic and geologic observations, we interpret that the <b>backstop</b> was generated due to the large age differences of accreted material resulting from an inferred hiatus in subduction between ∼ 13 and 6 Ma. The time-dependent processes such as the igneous activity in middle Miocene further {{contribute to the development of}} the <b>backstop.</b> A ridge structure beneath the forearc basin located trenchward of this <b>backstop</b> and running roughly parallel to it appears to reflect activity on an ancient splay fault. The strike of the ancient splay fault runs parallel to the <b>backstop</b> identified in this study and oblique to the current trench. This geometry suggests that location and mechanical behavior of this splay fault system is influenced by the <b>backstop,</b> and its distribution could be related to the coseismic rupture area...|$|R

40|$|Collaborative {{policy making}} {{has been an}} {{increasingly}} popular method of solving use conflicts on public lands. Representatives of interested groups are authorized to negotiate land use policy {{in the shadow of}} a government imposed <b>backstop</b> policy. This process can be modeled using cooperative game theory over multiple goods in an Edgeworth Box framework, and its outcomes predicted using axiomatic bargaining theories (e. g. Pareto efficiency or the Nash bargain). A challenge for collaborative policymaking arises when users’ historical land use entitlements differ from the <b>backstop</b> the government will impose if negotiations fail. A challenge for the predictive power of axiomatic bargaining theory arises when the government’s <b>backstop</b> policy (and the Nash bargain it generates) creates substantial inequality of benefits among users. In this paper, we use laboratory experiments to test the effect on bargaining of 1) the divergence of historical entitlements from the prospective <b>backstop</b> and 2) the divergence of the Nash bargain generated by the <b>backstop</b> policy from the outcome that equalizes benefits. We examine the effects of both types of divergence on agreement rates, and on the likelihood that parties settle inside the bargaining lens, on the contract curve, and at the Nash bargain. We find that divergence of historical entitlements from the <b>backstop</b> significantly changes bargaining outcomes when the historical benefits were equally distributed and the benefits at the <b>backstop</b> and Nash are not. At the same time, historical entitlements do not affect outcomes when they were unequal but the <b>backstop</b> and Nash bargain generate equal benefits. We also find the outcomes parties reach are affected by the divergence of equality from the Nash bargain, independent of historical entitlement.

50|$|Backthrusting of {{the rear}} of the accretionary wedge, arcward over the rocks of the forearc basin, is a common aspect of accretionary tectonics. An older {{assumption}} that <b>backstops</b> of accretionary wedges dip back toward the arc, and that accreted material is emplaced below such <b>backstops,</b> is contradicted by observations from many active forearcs that indicate (1) backthrusting is common, (2) forearc basins are nearly ubiquitous associates of accretionary wedges, and (3) forearc basement, where imaged, appears to diverge from the sedimentary package, dipping under the wedge while the overlying sediments are often lifted up against it. Backthrusting may be favored where relief is high between the crest of the wedge and the surface of the forearc basin because the relief must be supported by shear stress along the backthrust.|$|E
