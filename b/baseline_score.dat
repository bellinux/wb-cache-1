Method A 10 months follow-up study including 198 (female 156, 79 %) nursing home patients, mean age 87 (s. d 7. 7) years. Scales applied; {{quality of life in}} late stage dementia (QUALID) scale and three subscales (wellbeing, sadness and tension), neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire 10 items (NPI- 10 -Q), clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale, physical self-maintenance (PSMS) scale and a scale of general medical health. Use of psychotropic medication, gender and age was collected from the patient's records. Results Mean baseline QUALID score: 20. 6 (s. d. 7. 0), follow-up score: 22. 9 (s. d. 7. 4), mean change 2. 8 (s. d. 7. 4). QOL improved in 30. 8 %, were unchanged in 14. 7 %, deteriorated in 54. 6 % of patients. A regression analysis revealed that change in QUALID score was significantly associated with: QUALID <b>baseline</b> <b>score</b> (beta -. 381, p-value. 000), change in NPI score (beta. 421, p-value. 000), explained variance 38. 1 %.

40|$|Abstract Background A cardio-ankle {{vascular}} index (CAVI) {{has been}} developed to represent the extent of arteriosclerosis throughout the aorta, femoral artery and tibial artery independent of blood pressure. To practically use CAVI as a diagnostic tool for determining the extent of arteriosclerosis, our study objectives were (1) to establish the <b>baseline</b> CAVI <b>scores</b> by age and gender among cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk-free persons, (2) to compare CAVI scores between genders {{to test the hypothesis}} that the extent of arteriosclerosis in men is greater than in women, and (3) to compare CAVI scores between the CVD risk-free group and the CVD high-risk group in order to test the hypothesis that the extent of arteriosclerosis in the CVD high-risk group is greater than in the CVD risk-free group. Methods Study subjects were 32, 627 urban residents 20 - 74 years of age who participated in CVD screening in Japan during 2004 - 2006. A new device (model VaSera VS- 1000) was used to measure CAVI scores. At the time of screening, CVD high-risk persons were defined as those having any clinical abnormalities of CVD, and CVD risk-free persons were defined as those without any clinical abnormalities of CVD. Age-specific average CAVI scores were compared between genders and between the CVD risk-free group and the CVD high-risk group. Student's t-test using two independent samples was applied to a comparison of means between two groups. Results Average age-specific <b>baseline</b> <b>scores</b> of CAVI in the CVD risk-free group linearly increased in both genders as their age increased. Average age-specific <b>baseline</b> <b>scores</b> of CAVI in the CVD risk-free group were significantly greater among men than among women.

The aim {{of this study was to}} identify and characterise homogeneous subgroups with distinct 3 -year trajectories of {{disability and}} fatigue, separately. Methods: A 3 -year cohort study including 215 patients with SSc was conducted. Functional disability was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Fatigue was assessed using the SF- 36 Vitality subscale. Longitudinal trajectories were identified using latent class growth analyses (LCGA). Baseline patient characteristics were compared across classes using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Two disability classes were identified: a 'low' group (n= 133) with low <b>baseline</b> HAQ-DI <b>scores</b> (intercept= 0. 48) and slight, statistically non-significant deterioration over time (slope= 0. 01), and a 'high' group (n= 82) with high <b>baseline</b> HAQ-DI <b>scores</b> (intercept= 1. 63) and also slight, statistically non-significant deterioration over time (slope= 0. 01). Patients in the high disability group were more likely to be female, have higher fatigue, more helplessness, and less emotion-focused coping. Two fatigue classes were identified: an 'average' group (n= 99) with average <b>baseline</b> Vitality <b>scores</b> (intercept= 53. 9) and slight, statistically non-significant deterioration over time (slope=- 0. 23), and a 'high' fatigue group (n= 116) with low <b>baseline</b> Vitality <b>scores</b> (intercept= 39. 8) and also slight, but non-significant deterioration over time (slope=- 0. 15).

This subanalysis assesses the effect of dose of rtPA by region on clearance of IVH. METHODS: Sixty-four patients within 12 to 24 hours of spontaneous IVH were randomized to placebo or 0. 3 mg, 1 mg, or 3 mg of rtPA twice daily through an extraventricular drain. Twelve subregions of the ventricles were scored from 0 to 4. Effect of dose on IVH clearance to 50 % of <b>baseline</b> <b>score</b> was compared by survival analysis for all regions combined and by subregion. Models including ventricular region, dose, and <b>baseline</b> <b>score</b> were compared by Cox proportional hazards. RESULTS: IVH score reduced faster across all regions with increasing rtPA dose (clearance to 50 %: log-rank P< 0. 0001; placebo- 11. 43 days, 95 % CI, 5. 68 - 17. 18; 0. 3 mg- 3. 19 days, 1. 00 - 5. 38; 1 mg- 3. 54 days, 0. 45 - 6. 64; 3 mg- 2. 59 days, 1. 72 - 3. 46). In the combined models, dose and <b>baseline</b> <b>score</b> were independently associated with reduction in IVH score, which was quickest in the midline ventricles, then the anterior half of the lateral ventricles and slowest in the posterior half of the lateral ventricles (clearance to 50 %: P< 0. 0001; rtPA dose: hazard ratio, 1. 47, 1. 30 - 1. 67; midline versus anterolateral hazard ratio, 1. 71, 1. 08 - 2. 71; midline versus posterolateral hazard ratio, 4. 05, 2. 46 - 6. 65; <b>baseline</b> <b>score</b> hazard ratio, 0. 96, 0. 91 - 1. 01) with a significant interaction between dose and ventricular region (P= 0. 005).

DesignPatients scheduled for TKA in 15 hospitals in Spain were recruited and provided pre-operative and 1 -year postoperative Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain and Function scores. 1 year following surgery, patients completed questionnaires that determined the importance of any changes in status since surgery {{as well as the}} extent of satisfaction with the 1 -year outcome. Kappa (κ) was used {{to determine the extent of}} concordance between MCID and PASS measures for the entire sample and after splitting the sample based on quartiles of the baseline WOMAC scores. ResultsA total of 923 patients participated in the study. The extent of concordance between MCID and PASS without regard to <b>baseline</b> <b>score</b> was κ =  0. 41 (95 % Confidence Interval (CI)  =  0. 36, 0. 47) for WOMAC Function and after stratifying baseline scores into quartiles, κ =  0. 72 (95 %CI =  0. 68, 0. 77).

Methods: 967 participants in a cohort study of alcohol consumption in New Zealand provided data at baseline and again six months later. We use graphical methods and apply thresholds of 8, 12, 16 and 20 in AUDIT scores to explore RTM. Results: There was a negative association between <b>baseline</b> AUDIT <b>scores</b> and change in AUDIT <b>scores</b> from <b>baseline</b> to six months, which in the absence of bias and confounding, is RTM. Students with lower <b>baseline</b> <b>scores</b> tended to have higher follow-up scores and conversely, those with higher <b>baseline</b> <b>scores</b> tended to have lower follow-up scores. When a threshold score of 8 was used to select a subgroup, the observed mean change was approximately half of that observed without a threshold. The application of higher thresholds produced greater apparent reductions in alcohol consumption. Conclusions: Part of the reduction seen in the control groups of brief alcohol intervention trials is likely to be due to RTM and the amount of change is likely to be greater as the threshold for entry to the trial increases. Quantification of RTM warrants further study and should assist understanding assessment and other research participation effects...|$|R
