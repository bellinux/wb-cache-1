5|$|Castell had a friend, James Oglethorpe, a Tory MP who {{years later}} founded the American colony of Georgia. Oglethorpe <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{questions}} about the treatment of debtor prisoners, {{and a group of}} debtors, perhaps at Oglethorpe's instigation, lodged a complaint about their treatment with the mayor of London and his aldermen, who interviewed the Fleet's warden on 21 December 1728.|$|E
5|$|Besides their {{obligations}} as obedient, peaceful and nonpolitical {{inhabitants of the}} Grand Duchy, who had a few decades earlier accepted the class system as {{the natural order of}} their life, the commoners <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for and demand their civil rights and citizenship in Finnish society. The power struggle between the Finnish estates and the Russian administration gave a concrete role model and free space for the labor movement. On the other side, due to at least a century-long tradition and experience of administrative leadership, the Finnish elite saw itself as the inherent natural power.|$|E
5|$|When the {{legislature}} {{met for the}} first time after the 1909 election, things seemed to be going well for Rutherford and his government. He controlled a huge majority, albeit slightly reduced from the 1905 election, and enjoyed widespread popularity. His government had achieved significant success in setting up a new province, and this success looked poised to continue. Early in this new legislative session, however, two signs of trouble appeared: Liberal backbencher John R. Boyle <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> questions about the agreement between the government and the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company, and Cushing resigned from cabinet over his views of this same agreement.|$|E

25|$|Donna DeMasi, 16, and Joanne Lomino, 18, {{walked home}} from a movie soon after midnight on November 27, 1976. They were chatting {{on the porch of}} Lomino's home in Bellerose, Queens when a man dressed in {{military}} fatigues who seemed to be in his early 20s approached them and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> directions.|$|E
25|$|Salmon was {{not only}} used for food, it was also crucial for trading. This began when the Hudson’s Bay Company set up trading posts in Stó:lō territory. They {{originally}} wanted the Stó:lō to hunt beaver for them but quickly learned that the Stó:lō {{had little interest in}} beaver. The Hudson Bay Company then <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for salmon after seeing the impressive hauls that were being made. In August 1829 the Stó:lō traded Fort Langley 7000 Salmon.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century {{some women}} <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for, demand, and then agitate and {{demonstrate}} {{for the right}} to vote – the right to participate in their government and its law making. Other women opposed suffrage, like Helen Kendrick Johnson, who argued in the 1897 pamphlet Woman and the Republic that women could achieve legal and economic equality without having the vote. The ideals of women's suffrage developed alongside that of universal suffrage and today women's suffrage is considered a right (under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women). During the 19th century the right to vote was gradually extended in many countries, and women started to campaign for their right to vote. In 1893 New Zealand became the first country to give women the right to vote on a national level. Australia gave women the right to vote in 1902.|$|E

25|$|Abe {{first went}} about {{the task of}} {{removing}} Zusho, who was greatly relied upon by Narioki, by inviting him to Edo. Abe’s stated purpose was a desire to discuss the Ryūkyū crisis and its current handling. In {{the process of the}} conversation, Abe <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Zusho a line of questioning that made it apparently clear to Zusho that Abe, as well as the Tokugawa shogun, knew the truth of the illegal Satsuma-Ryūkyū-Western trade relations, which were being carried out against the shogunate's policy of seclusion. Zusho’s devotion to Narioki pushed him to take full responsibility for the illicit trade by committing seppuku on December 18, 1848. On December 3, 1850, Narioki was called to Edo by the shogun and presented with a prized set of tea utensils, indicating the shogun's desire for Narioki to retire. On February 3, 1851, Nairoki retired and Shimazu Nariakira was made daimyō of Satsuma.|$|E
25|$|When he was 19, Riley met 15-year-old Marlene Olive while dealing {{drugs at}} her high school. He {{developed}} {{a crush on}} her and began to pursue her. Although she was initially put off by his weight, the couple eventually had sex and began a relationship largely controlled by Marlene Olive. Riley provided her with free drugs, gifts, and transportation, listened to her problems, and sometimes helped her carry out sexual or criminal fantasies. She frequently threatened to break up with Riley unless he did what she wanted and claimed to have magical powers of control over him, in which he reportedly believed. He was anxious to please her {{in order to continue}} the relationship and twice attempted suicide when she briefly broke up with him. As she had with previous boyfriends, Marlene Olive soon <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Riley for help or advice in killing her mother or suggest that he himself kill her parents. Jim and Naomi Olive initially approved of their daughter dating Riley, finding him polite and responsible.|$|E
25|$|Saint-Quentin-la-Poterie {{is about}} 5km north of Uzès and some 30km north of Nîmes. Joseph {{was one of}} ten {{children}} born to a family of horticulturists {{in the service of}} the duc d'Uzès. All hands being needed in the fields, Joseph was not sent to school. By the age of 17 he had proved his worth as a gardener, and the duke offered him a post at his mansion in Paris. Joseph took the opportunity to attend evening classes and learned to read and write. When friends of the duke <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> his advice, his horizons widened and he started to make the high-level contacts that were to define his later career. In 1846 he left the duke's service to take up a post at the Tuileries Gardens near the Louvre. Responsible for the orangery, he began to look for a more durable form of container for the orange trees, which were moved from the open air into the greenhouses during the winter. He began to make them of cement (mixed with sand, cinders, and/or crushed firebricks) and reinforced them with a grid of iron rods. There was a general notion at the time that thermal expansion and contraction of embedded iron would rupture the concrete. It seems that Monier spent some years experimenting with his containers in order to prove that this was not the case.|$|E

500|$|At Moscow, Kennan {{found the}} {{atmosphere}} even more regimented than on his previous trips, with police guards following him everywhere, discouraging contact with Soviet citizens. At the time, Soviet propaganda charged the U.S. with preparing for war, which Kennan did not wholly dismiss. [...] "I <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> myself whether... {{we had not}} contributed... by the overmilitarization of our policies and statements... to a belief in Moscow that it was war we were after, that we had settled for its inevitability, {{that it was only}} a matter of time before we would unleash it." ...|$|E

500|$|About {{two weeks}} later, the {{battered}} ship and starving crew landed in Lough Swilly, Ireland. For {{several weeks before}} the storm, Newton had been reading The Christian's Pattern, {{a summary of the}} 15th-century The Imitation of Christ by Thomas à Kempis. The memory of his own [...] "Lord have mercy upon us!" [...] uttered during a moment of desperation in the storm did not leave him; he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> if he was worthy of God's mercy or in any way redeemable as he had not only neglected his faith but directly opposed it, mocking others who showed theirs, deriding and denouncing God as a myth. He came to believe that God had sent him a profound message and had begun to work through him.|$|E
500|$|During {{this period}} of {{commercial}} success, the extensive media attention and [...] "the stress of the grand tour" [...] began to affect Björk, as she repeatedly complained about the intrusiveness of tabloids and reporters. During the Asian leg of the Post Tour, Björk arrived at Bangkok International Airport with her son Sindri after a long haul flight; reporters were present, despite Björk's earlier request that the press leave her and her son alone until she held a press conference. While she was {{walking away from the}} reporters, Julie Kaufman <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Sindri questions; this angered Björk, who lunged at Kaufman, knocking her to the ground. Björk's record company said that the reporter had been pestering her for four days. She later apologised to Kaufman, who declined to involve the police. The televised incident generated unwanted attention, as did the suicide of Björk's stalker Ricardo López, which caused a media sensation. On 12 September, López sent a letter bomb rigged with sulfuric acid to Björk's residence in London, returned home and filmed his suicide. After viewing his video diary, police contacted Scotland Yard, who intercepted the package without incident. To record in privacy away from the unwanted interest of the press, Björk's tour drummer Trevor Morais offered his studio in Málaga, Spain for Björk to record what would be Homogenic. Björk had begun the first sessions of the album in 1996, at her Maida Vale residence, after the completion of the extensive Post Tour gave her an urgent need to write new songs as a form of therapy.|$|E
500|$|On December 12, 2007, Keyes {{participated in}} the Des Moines Registers Republican presidential debate, {{televised}} nationwide by PBS and the cable news networks. This {{was the first major}} presidential debate in which Keyes participated during the 2008 election season and the last Republican debate before the Iowa Caucuses. Although Keyes was not listed on the latest national CNN poll leading up to the debate, he registered with at least 1 percent of the Iowa vote in order to participate. During the debate, after the moderator <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> a question of Texas Congressman Ron Paul, Keyes insisted he was not getting fair treatment. He interrupted the debate moderator at one point, saying that she had not called on him in several rounds and that he had to make an issue of it. He went on the offensive against his opponents during the debate, criticizing Rudy Giuliani's pro-choice position, as well as Mitt Romney's recent change in position on the same subject. In answering a question about global warming, he continued his criticisms of other candidates, saying, [...] "I'm in favor of reducing global warming, because I think the most important emission we need to control is the hot air emission of politicians who pretend one thing and don't deliver". He also advocated ending the income tax, establishing state-sanctioned prayer in public schools, and abolishing abortion. Toward the end of the debate, Keyes stated he could not support Giuliani if he were to win the nomination due to the former New York mayor's position on abortion.|$|E
