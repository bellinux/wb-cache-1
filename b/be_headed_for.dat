5|$|Unsatisfied {{with the}} low pay, in Kremenchuk Adler led an {{unsuccessful}} actors' strike. A series of intrigues almost {{led to a}} breakup with Sonya, but ultimately led both back into Rosenberg's troupe and led to their marriage in Poltava. When this particular troupe broke up, the Adlers were among the few players to remain with Rosenberg {{to form a new}} one that included the actress who later became famous under the name of Keni Liptzin. In Chernigov, Adler turned down the opportunity to act in a Russian-language production of Boris Gudonov. Around this time Goldfaden appeared again and, after using an elaborate intrigue to demonstrate to the Adlers that Rosenberg had no loyalty to them, recruited them to his own troupe, which at the time appeared to <b>be</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> a triumphant entry into Saint Petersburg.|$|E

Essex's youngsters, Alastair Cook, who looked to <b>be</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> an England call-up before long, and Ravinder Bopara, aged 20 and 19 respectively, made merry with the bat. Although the pitch did not seam {{as much as}} the first day, they put on 181 together. Cook was finally out bowled for 111, and Bopara not out for 71 at close, with Essex on 224 for 3, 34 runs ahead.|$|E

25|$|The Greyhounds {{reversed}} {{their fortunes}} of the previous Memorial Cup, winning all three games of the round-robin, advancing directly to the tournament finals. Their opponent in the finals would be the Kamloops Blazers. The Greyhounds came back from an early 3-0 deficit 15 minutes into the game to tie the score at 3-3. Kamloops scored early {{in the third period}} for a 4-3 lead. Chris Simon then tied the game for Sault Ste. Marie with four minutes remaining to play.

25|$|Marinovich, who was rattled in {{the first}} half, found a rhythm in the second half, leading the team 62 yards in 11 plays with their first drive. Running back Nick Bell, who {{finished}} the game with 107 rushing yards, gained 46 yards on eight carries, while Jaeger finished the possession with a 26-yard field goal that made the score 7-6. Later in the quarter, LA appeared to <b>be</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> a go-ahead score. But linebacker Lonnie Marts managed to force a fumble from Marcus Allen and defensive tackle Dan Saleaumua recovered the ball. Kansas City then drove 61 yards to the Raiders 1-yard line where Lowery's 18-yard field goal {{in the fourth quarter}} put the Chiefs up 10–6.|$|E
25|$|On August 17, 2010, the 160GB PS3 slim {{previously}} {{released in}} Japan was announced for North America during Gamescom 2010. The 320GB model was also announced to <b>be</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> NA, {{but it would}} come with Move and Sports Champion. Because {{it is going to}} be a Move bundle, it would not be released until September 19 which is when Move launches. Currently, there is no way to purchase the 320GB model outside of the Move bundle, except in the United Kingdom where it is available to purchase with GT5 for £284.99. Because of the 160GB model, Sony has discontinued manufacturing of the 120GB model. The 160GB retails for $299 USD, and the 320GB for $399. Feature-wise, these new models are identical to the previous slim models.|$|E

25|$|In mid-November Call tried again. His forces made {{it across}} the Withlacoochee this time, but found the Cove abandoned. Call divided his forces, and {{proceeded}} up the river (south) on both sides. On November 17 Seminoles were routed from a large camp. There was another battle the next day, and the Seminoles were assumed to <b>be</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the Wahoo Swamp. Call waited to bring the other column across the river, then entered the Wahoo Swamp on November 21. The Seminoles resisted the advance in the Battle of Wahoo Swamp, as their families were close by, but had to retreat across a stream. Major David Moniac, a mix-blooded Creek {{who was the first}} Native American to graduate from West Point, tried to determine how deep the stream was, but was shot and killed by the Seminoles.|$|E

Though it was their overall strangeness and shared taste in non-mainstream music that caused them to become friends, both appeared to <b>be</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> very conventional careers. Haynes, as captain of Trinity's basketball team, as well as the school's [...] "Accountant of the Year", soon graduated to a position with a respected Texas accounting firm, while Leary remained in college working on his MBA degree.|$|E

[...] Clinton had still not realized that Washington was marching south, something he did not have confirmed until September 2. [...] When they learned of de Barras' departure they immediately concluded that de Grasse must <b>be</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the Chesapeake (but still did not know of his strength). [...] Graves sailed from New York on August 31 with 19 ships of the line; [...] Clinton wrote Cornwallis to warn him that Washington was coming, and that he would send 4,000 reinforcements.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of 2015, Barcelona were {{perceived}} to <b>be</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> another disappointing end to the season, with renewed speculation in the media that Messi was leaving the club. A turning point came on 11 January during a 3–1 victory over Atlético Madrid, the first time Barça's attacking trident of Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar, dubbed [...] "MSN", each scored in a match, marking {{the beginning of a}} highly successful run. After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Suárez, their striker. From there, he regained his best – arguably his best-ever – form, while Suárez and Neymar ended the team's attacking dependency on their star player. With 58 goals [...] from Messi, the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Angelica Jade Bastién, {{writing for}} RogerEbert.com, said, [...] "For {{all of its}} wondrous world-building and trippy effects, Doctor Strange isn't the {{evolutionary}} step forward for Marvel {{that it needs to}} be storytelling-wise. Underneath all of its improvements, the core narrative is something we've seen countless times." [...] Mara Reinstein of US Weekly called the film [...] "joyless" [...] and wrote, [...] "Despite [...] alluring powers, he can't save an overly convoluted film that relies on a galaxy of derivative 3-D special-effect tricks... Nobody is having much fun here — save for the doctor's Cloak of Levitation that has its own devilish personality and can whisk him out of scary situations." [...] Rex Reed of the New York Observer called Doctor Strange [...] "an awkwardly cliché-riddled mix of hamstrung imagination and bizarro reality" [...] and said, [...] "None of it makes any sense... For characterization, dialogue, narrative arc, acceptable acting and coherence, go elsewhere." [...] Adam Graham of The Detroit News said, [...] "Cumberbatch is wildly charismatic in the lead role... But that’s the thing: He’s a better party guest than he is a host. Doctor Strange is a fine introduction, but by the end, you’re not sad to <b>be</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the door." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{opposed to}} all other sumo ranks yokozuna cannot be demoted. [...] A yokozuna is {{expected}} to retire if {{he can no longer}} compete {{at the peak of the}} sport or in some cases if he is deemed to have not upheld the dignity of the rank. [...] Expectations are so high that, even in the course of one tournament, a yokozuna who early on appears to <b>be</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> a losing tournament will feel the pressure to retire; there are many cases of yokozuna dropping out mid-tournament with a real or imagined injury to avoid a make-koshi (a losing record) and the expectation to retire. These expectations are a large part of the reason that the promotion criteria for yokozuna are so strict in the first place.|$|E
