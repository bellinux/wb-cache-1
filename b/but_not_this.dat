25|$|The self {{is found}} to be a cause of force, free in its action, on the ground that we are obliged to relate the {{volition}} of consciousness to the self as its cause, and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from the analysis whether the self is immediately observed as an acting or originating cause, or whether reflection working on the principle of causality is compelled to infer its existence and character. If self is actually so given, we do not need the principle of causality to infer it; if it is not so given, causality could never give us either the notion or the fact of self as a cause or force, far less as an ultimate one. All that it could do would be to warrant a cause of some sort, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>this</b> or that reality as the cause. And further, the principle of causality, if fairly carried out, as universal and necessary, would not allow us to stop at personality or will as the ultimate cause of its effect—volition. Once applied to the facts at all, it would drive us beyond the first antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further cause or ground—in fact, land us in an infinite regress of causes.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+. He praised the storytelling, positively commenting {{on how it}} revolved around Skinner and his past life. In addition he wrote that the episode possessed some [...] "good scares". However, {{he felt that the}} [...] "central paranormal mystery of the episode is handled in a fashion that feels a bit muddled". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a moderately negative review and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode fails to capitalize on the idea of delving into the world of Walter Skinner. The conspiracy elements seem a bit redundant, and the paranormal side of the episode is a forced and inconsistent mess. Instead of developing something unique about Skinner, the episode dwells on what is already known or suggested, leaving the character in the same emotional place at the end as in the beginning." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Avatar" [...] a D+, describing it as [...] "ridiculous" [...] and saying, [...] "The clench-toothed Skinner deserves more air time, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>this</b> USA Network reject".|$|E

Jackson said that Obama [...] "made the case we've been here before, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>this</b> time will we linger. This time we're going to higher ground." ...|$|E
