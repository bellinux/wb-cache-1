40|$|Abstract. Business Continuity Management (BCM) is {{a process}} to manage risks, emergencies, and {{recovery}} plans of an organization during a crisis. It results in a document called Business Continuity Plans (BCP) that specifies the methodology and procedures required to <b>backup</b> <b>and</b> <b>recover</b> the functional unit of a disrupted business. Traditionally, the BCP assessment is based only on the continuity of IS infrastructures and does not consider possible relations with the business objectives and business processes. This traditional approach assumes {{that the risk of}} business continuity is resulted from the disruption of the IS infrastructures. However, we believe there are situations where the risk emerges even the infrastructures up and running. Moreover, the lack of modeling framework and the aided-tool make the process even harder. In this paper, we propose a framework to support modeling and analysis of BCP from the organization perspective, where risks and treatments are modeled and analyzed along strategic objectives and their realizations. An automated reasoner based on cost-benefit analysis techniques is proposed to elicit and then adopt the most cost-efficient plan. The approach is developed using the Tropos Goal-Risk Framework and the Time Dependency and Recovery Model as underlain frameworks. A Loan Originating Process case study is used as a running example to illustrate the proposal. ...|$|E
40|$|Over years, {{there have}} been {{tremendous}} changes in internetworking technologies {{and there are a}} number of real time applications that are flooded into the market. Most real-time applications are sensitive to traffic loss because of their nature of exchanging data without acknowledgement. In any type of data network, redundancy is important to <b>backup</b> <b>and</b> <b>recover</b> the connectivity without human intervention in case of device or link failure. However, it is very crucial to design an optimal redundant network, particularly for real-time applications providing minimal losses during fail-over. Configuration of redundancy in different networks varies and depends on the equipment and network design itself. This thesis focuses on the redundancy needed in campus network design which is quite popular nowadays in most of medium and large enterprises, universities or government agencies. Two major designs of redundancy are studied: default gateway redundancy and routed access. In the first option, the one logical segment of network uses common L 2 switches while in the other – the same segment is constructed with more expensive advanced multilayer switches. The network is built in the lab environment. As an example of real-time communication the VoIP call is simulated in the network. The failures on different areas of nodes or links are caused manually. Results of packet loss during fail-over are recorded. The baseline of recovery performance is constructed using these results which are derived from different scenarios using different configurations and equipment. The baseline data is evaluated and conclusion is made on the trade-offs, limitations, advantages and disadvantages of the redundancy options in the campus network design. The work done in this thesis is supportive for network architects and designers to take into consideration the equipment and configuration to be used when implementing redundancy for real-time communications. The results and conclusion will support them in choosing the options for constructing the redundant network, or taking into account the trade-offs when migrating from one option to another...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Storage {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied {{during the past few}} decades (Foster et al., 1997; José Guimarães, 2001). However, the emerging trends on distributed computing bring new solutions for existent problems. Grid computing proposes a distributed approach for data storing. In this paper, we introduce a Grid-based system (ARCO) developed for multimedia storage of large ammounts of data. The system is being developed for Biblioteca Nacional, the National Library of Portugal. Using Grid informational system and resources management, we propose a transparent system where TeraBytes of data are stored in a beowulf cluster built of commodity components with <b>backup</b> solution <b>and</b> error <b>recover</b> mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Context: <b>Backup</b> <b>and</b> Disaster Recovery, DR play a {{vital role}} in day-to-day IT operations. They define {{extensive}} aspects of business continuity plan in an enterprise. There is a continuous need to improve <b>backup</b> <b>and</b> recovery performance concerning attributes such as backup window size, high availability, security, etc. Definitive information is what enterprises strive for and rely upon to deviate from traditional methods towards advancing technologies, which are an intrinsic segment of business mundane actions. Objectives: In this study, we investigate <b>Backup</b> <b>and</b> DR plans on an enterprise level. They are compared in terms of performance metrics such as Recovery Time Objective, Recovery Point Objective, Time taken to backup, Time taken to <b>recover</b> <b>and</b> Total cost of ownership. Also, how CPU and memory utilization conduct differ in both tape-based, cloud-based <b>Backup</b> <b>and</b> DR. Methods: Literature study was the first step to formulate research questions by understanding present technologies in <b>Backup</b> <b>and</b> DR. This led us to conduct a survey for further understanding of challenges faced in industries gaining a more practical exposure. A case study was conducted in an enterprise to capture accurate values. An experiment had been deployed to compare performance of both scenarios and analyze which methodology elevates <b>Backup</b> <b>and</b> DR performance by overcoming challenges. Results: The results attained through this thesis encompass performance related metrics and also the load in terms of CPU and memory utilizations. Survey results were observed to gain better understanding of current technologies <b>and</b> challenges with <b>Backup</b> <b>and</b> DR in enterprises. The cloudbased backup has proved to be better in considered enterprise environment during experimentation in terms of RPO, RTO, CPU, memory utilizations and Total Cost of ownership.
