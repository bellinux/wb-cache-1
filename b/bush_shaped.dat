40|$|Friction {{drilling}} {{is a novel}} hole-making process {{performed on}} thin-walled sheet metals. The friction between a rapid-rotating conical tool and a sheet metal generates heat to soften the work material and penetrate it to form a hole. The bushing is formed in situ from the workpiece. This experimental study investigated friction drilling process. Axial thrust forces during the process were measured by a dynamometer and data acquisition system. The thrust force curves and the cross-sectioned images of friction-drilled holes were characterized to {{study the effects of}} process parameters such as spindle speed, feed rate, workpiece thickness, and tool diameter. The results showed that either increasing spindle speed or decreasing feed rate can reduce the thrust forces. Generating a bushing with good quality has been a challenge in friction drilling.

40|$|Abstract – Due to the {{beneficial}} of the bushing form, the connection length and clamping strength is increased in friction drilling of thin-walled cast materials. In this experimental study 2400, 3600, and 4800 rpm spindle speeds, 50, 75, and 100 mm/min feed rates, 240, 360, and 480 tool conical angles were selected. 2, 4, and 6 mm thicknesses of A 7075 -T 651 aluminium alloys and St 37 steel materials were drilled with using 10 mm diameter HSS (High Speed Steel) and WC (Tungsten Carbide) rotating conical tools which have 16 mm cylindrical region length. I was analysed the surface roughness, bushing height and bushing sheet thickness {{according to the}} spindle speed, feed rate, tool conical angle, workpiece material thickness, both workpiece and tool material types parameters. Consequently {{it was discovered that}} in friction drilling of 2 mm thickness A 7075 -T 651 aluminium alloy, the bushing was formed as petal shape, which limited providing connection length and clamping strength owing to the brittleness of the material. In friction drilling of brittle materials, {{there were a lot of}} cracks generated on the <b>bushing</b> <b>shape.</b> The minimum surface roughness values were obtained at 3600 rpm spindle speed and 75 mm/min feed rate conditions friction drilling of St 37 steel material. The surface roughness values of A 7075 -T 651 aluminium alloys were higher than St 37 steel materials. In conditions decreasing the spindle speeds, tool conical angles, and increasing feed rates, the bushing height was increased and bushing wall thickness was decreased...|$|R

50|$|Bushings {{are perhaps}} the easiest things to change on a truck in order to change the feel of how it turns. Bushings are usually made of a {{polyurethane}} material, and come in varying shapes and durometers (hardness). Two of the most standard <b>bushing</b> <b>shapes</b> include barrels and cones. Barrels, having a larger shape, are often thought to have more stability and rebound whereas cones, having a more narrow shape, allow for more turn and less rebound. The durometer of the bushing also greatly influences its characteristics. a harder bushing (such as a bushing with a rating around 97A) will be much harder to turn on than a softer bushing (something around 78A). The type of washers used with the bushing can also greatly affect the bushing's characteristics. While {{it depends on the}} size of the washer, generally a cupped washer will be the most restrictive on a bushing, a flat washer will be neutral, and a flipped cup washer will be the least restrictive.Another aspect of the longboard that has an influence on bushing performance is the bushing seat on the truck. The bushing seat is the area on the hangar where the bushing makes contact. This area often has a rim to cup the edge of the bushing, adding a small amount of restriction as the bushing deforms through a turn. Some trucks have very loose or even non-existent bushing seats, whereas others have very restrictive bushing seats, greatly reducing bushing deformation. More restrictive bushing seats generally found on trucks designed with faster riding in mind as they offer more stability and lean.|$|R

40|$|Roses {{have contributed}} to our social, {{economic}} and religious life hence they are called â€œIndex of Civilizationâ€�. Presently in Pakistan most of the rose cultivars have been introduced from other countries hence they fail to fit in new environmental conditions of the country. Keeping in view {{the importance of this}} issue present study was aimed to get insight into the breeding procedure, complexities and tactics leading to achieve hybrid progenies and to study the magnitude of hybrid vigor inherited in the next generation of parent roses. For this purpose, comparatively well acclimatized and hip producing cultivars including â€œAutumn Sunsetâ€�, â€œIcebergâ€�, â€œParadiseâ€�, â€œAngel Faceâ€�, â€œCasinoâ€�, â€œLouise Odierâ€�, â€œGrand Marginaâ€�, â€œHandelâ€� and â€œGruss an Teplitzâ€� were selected for crossing. They were planted in the Rose field of Institute of Horticultural Sciences, university of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan. Morphological description of all cultivars revealed various blends of color of flowers, foliage and leaf hairiness, petiole pubescence and inflorescence types. Data regarding flowering and yields traits also varied in all varieties, however over all better performance was exhibited by the cultivars Iceberg and Gruss an Teplitz scoring 2. 5 points each. Poor performance was exhibited by the cultivar Louise Odier. The genotypic and phenotypic and environmental coefficients of variations varied for all quantitative traits. Strong positive correlation was exhibited between number of flowers per plant and overall performance of bushes, flower diameter and petal length, <b>bush</b> <b>shape</b> and height of the plant however fragrance was negatively correlated to flower persistence life. Cluster analysis of the parent on the basis of quantitative traits revealed four major clusters which predicted the different performance for some traits but same for other. Within the individual cluster all the cultivars almost behaved similar. Results about pollen vigor parameters indicated that great variations in pollen quality, quantity, and viability and germination % ages. Maximum number of pollens per anther were exhibited by the cultivar Handel (1612. 3) followed by cultivar Angel face (1588. 7). Minimum numbers of pollens per anther were counted in the cultivar Iceberg. On average basis the performance of Angel face and Handel was better with respect to both number of anther per flower and number of pollens per anther. Pollen size (L: D) was almost same in all cultivars hence no significant differences were observed. Comparison of means of viability %age revealed that maximum number of viable pollens in term of viability %age were possessed by cultivar Handel (70 %) followed by â€˜Gruss an Teplitzâ€™ (64 %). The minimum viability of pollens was exhibited by the Cultivar â€˜Autumn Sunsetâ€™ having pollen viability of 35 %. Germination medium having 15 % sucrose proved very effective for optimum germination results as compared to 10 % and 20 % sucrose. On average basis the cultivar â€˜Grand Marginaâ€™ yielded maximum pollen tube length of 46. 556 Ã¬m followed by â€˜Gruss an Teplitzâ€™ having pollen germination of 40. 333 Ã¬m. The minimum pollen tube length of 9. 222 Ã¬m was observed in cultivar â€˜Icebergâ€™. Cluster analysis of cultivars on the basis of pollen quality and vigor parameters revealed three main groups. A strong correlation among pollen germination %age and pollen tube length (r = 0. 77) and pollen germination %age and pollen viability %age (r = 0. 731) was exhibited. Pollen germination is also strongly correlated with pollen size (r = 0. 738) The comparison of various fertility parameters in vitro and in vivo revealed that cultivar â€œHandelâ€� showing its maximum pollen viability in vitro performed well with respect to giving more crossing success in field as compared to its average pollen germination %age invitro conditions followed by the cultivar Autumn Sunset. Cultivar Ice Iceberg did not yielded any successful cross. Maximum hip setting %age (83) was observed in for the cross combinations Iceberg x Gruss an Teplitz and Iceberg x Casino and minimum (30 %) in Louise Odier x Paradise. Number of seed per hip also varied from 33 to 15 in all cross combinations. Response of seeds with respect to germination also varied significantly after treating the seed with various storage temperatures and acid treatments. Results indicated that germination period (F= 89. 95, F< 0. 05), germination %age (F= 67. 16, P< 0. 05), imbibition period (F= 26. 13, P< 0. 05) and seed vigor index (F= 112. 2, P< 0. 05) was affected significantly by all treatments accordingly. All the treatments also affected morphological traits of seedlings as well. Evaluation of hybrida in the field revealed that all the F 1 hybrids produced showed significant variations in qualitative and quantitative traits over their parents. Data regarding heterosis and heterobeltiosis %ages showed also negative and positive results for various traits over their parents. Variations were observed for flower color and diameter, prickles, <b>bush</b> <b>shape</b> and overall performance of all F 1 hybrid progenies. Performance of F 1 progenies was evaluated in the field conditions while having comparison with their respective parents and data was analyzed by ANOVA to check the significance of variations in the parents and progenies and comparison of means. Further, more hybrid vigor estimation (Heterosis and Heterobeltiosis) proved a useful tool to check the superiority and inferiority of progenies over their parents. Cluster analysis of the parent cultivars and progenies was useful to develop realation on the basis of similarity index among parent and hybrid progenies. Hybrid identification and genetic diversity studies among parents and progenies evaluated by SSR markers also confirmed the contribution of both parents for the development of F 1 hybrids. For genetic diversity study SSR loci proved very effective to amplify across parent cultivars, hybrids and to assess their polymorphic contents. Ten of the SSR primers exhibited similar sequence with known gene. Estimates of genetic diversity varied remarkably among loci. Observed heterozygosity (Ho) based on Neiâ€™s estimation revealed that the locus H 10, CL 9 and RW 54 contributed equally for generating more variation and scored maximum number of alleles for respective locus. Allele fixation trends were also observed for different loci and individual groups. Total gene diversity (Ht) was calculated and mean for all loci was 0. 852 while the average gene diversity (Hs) for all loci was calculated as 0. 768. It was clear from the dendrogram that parent cultivars compiled themselves into four main groups. Little differences were observed within the groups of parent cultivars. Confirmation of hybrids was done by comparing the common alleles between parent and hybrid against all primers. More over phenatic relationship was developed among hybrid progenies and parents to confirm the extent of contribution of each parent for genetic makeup of hybrid. All other hybrids were identified in the same method. It is concluded from the present study that hybrid cultivars have varying level of fertility and it is necessary to evaluated them in search of vigorous pollen donor parent. It is concluded from the result that diallel was not possible as most of the crosses failed. However ANOVA, comparison of means and Cluster analysis aided by SSR fulfilled the objective. Hybrid progenies exhibited vigor over parents for some traits but for other traits they remained uneffective in the climate of Faisalabad city. SSR markers proved helpful tool for confirmation of F 1 hybrids and discriminating the parent cultivars and progenies...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores how {{neoconservative}} ideology {{informed the}} Bush Administration’s interpretation/use of intelligence, {{leading to the}} decision to invade Iraq. The Administration based its decision to invade Iraq upon four neoconservative assumptions. The first assumption was that Saddam Hussein’s regime {{was on the verge}} of acquiring nuclear weapons and had already amassed stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons. The second assumption was that the regime had meaningful links with Al Qaeda and had something to do with 9 / 11. The third assumption was that, within Iraq, the regime’s fall would be followed by rapid and peaceful democratization. The fourth assumption was that a similar democratic transformation would be precipitated elsewhere in the region. This paper examines primary source documents authored by key members of the Bush Administration (President Bush, VP Cheney, Secretary Powell and Secretary Rice). These accounts are compared to other relevant primary source documents such as the “ 9 / 11 Commission Report” and the “National Intelligence Estimate. ” In addition, the preexisting 9 / 11 ideology held by top officials in the <b>Bush</b> Administration that <b>shaped</b> the decision to invade Iraq is examined.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{criteria}} for the visual quality of an ornamental plant such as rose <b>bush</b> is its <b>shape,</b> which should be compact and branched. To control both growth and branching, chemical growth regulators are commonly used. However, they {{have a negative impact}} on the environment and new environmental-friendly alternatives must be found. Water restrictions are known to reduce plant growth, but their effects on branching are still poorly understood. Rooted cuttings of rose plants (Rosa hybrida 'Radrazz') were grown in the greenhouse. Irrigation was managed by tensiometers in order to maintain the water potential of the substrate at a constant level (- 8 or - 26 kPa in Exp. 1) or to activate irrigation at a given level (- 10 or - 30 kPa in Exp. 2). Plants were submitted either to continuous water restrictions applied from the appearance of the order 1 axis floral bud until the flowering of order 2 (Exp. 1), or to alternations of dehydration-rehumectation of the substrate (discontinuous water restriction) applied from the emergence of order 2 axes until the flowering of order 4 axes (Exp. 2). Both continuous and discontinuous water restrictions reduced the length and diameter of axes that emerged after the beginning of the water restrictions. These reductions in axis length were due to the reduction of the mean metamer length and/or to the reduction of the metamer number per axis. Water restriction tended to decrease branching. Water restriction therefore led to the production of smaller but not always more compact rose bushes. The use of water restriction as an alternative method to chemical growth regulators to control plant shape still requires a specific technical itinerary to increase branching...|$|R
40|$|Production Methods Blueberries require fairly {{specific}} {{soil and}} climatic conditions. It takes between eight and 12 years for blueberries to reach full production. They require an average growing season of 160 days and late spring or early fall frost can damage plants. The best blueberry soils are acidic (pH below 5. 5) and very sandy. Blueberries will also grow in soils high in organic matter, {{such as a}} peat type of soil. Organic matter increases the water holding capacity of sandy soils. Irrigation is important because blueberry root systems are shallow and lack root hairs; this puts them at a disadvantage when the soil dries out. Blueberry soils are often found in topographically low areas so blueberries are very susceptible to spring frosts. Cold winter temperatures are probably the major factor in determining the total production of blueberries for a region in any given year. Price is very stable {{from year to year}} since most fruit is direct-marketed in New York. Because of the low topography of blueberry sites, waterlogged soils are a problem in the spring. Many growers own their own sprayers and do their own insecticide and fungicide applications. Plants are set in early spring at 4 to 5 feet apart with rows 10 to 12 feet apart. Blueberries require regular pruning to produce high yields of large fruit. The most fruitful blueberry canes are four to six years old and 1 to 2 inches in diameter at the base. Pruning is used to manage <b>bush</b> size and <b>shape.</b> Blueberry twigs require at least 15 % full sunlight to initiate flower buds...|$|R

The report, Towards Global Tax Cooperation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices, (2 ̆ 2 Towards Global Tax Cooperation 2 ̆ 2), identified a list of tax practices the OECD deemed harmful, such as 2 ̆ 2 ring-fencing 2 ̆ 2 (where foreign customers are subject to rules different than those applied to citizens which encourages the establishment of foreign entities with no substantial activities), a lack of transparency, {{and the absence of}} information exchange regarding tax practices.
