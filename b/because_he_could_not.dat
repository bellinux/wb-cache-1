5|$|In 1941 Kallman {{ended their}} sexual {{relationship}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> accept Auden's insistence on mutual fidelity, {{but he and}} Auden remained companions {{for the rest of}} Auden's life, sharing houses and apartments from 1953 until Auden's death. Auden dedicated both editions of his collected poetry (1945/50 and 1966) to Isherwood and Kallman.|$|E
5|$|This contradicted Wright's earlier {{statement}} when stopped by {{police in the}} district {{in the early hours}} of the morning: he implied he was unaware he was in the red light district and was driving around <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> sleep. Wright's rented flat was located in the red light area.|$|E
5|$|After {{thirteen}} months, {{a shortage}} of funds forced Johnson to leave Oxford without a degree, and he returned to Lichfield. Towards the end of Johnson's stay at Oxford, his tutor, Jorden, left Pembroke {{and was replaced by}} William Adams. He enjoyed Adams as a tutor, but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and he was forced to return home. He left behind many books that he had borrowed from his father <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford to transport them, and also because he hoped to return to Oxford soon.|$|E
50|$|He {{was awarded}} Moroccan {{citizenship}} in August 2013, which he didn't ask for but accepted <b>because</b> <b>he</b> felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> refuse.|$|R
50|$|However, Sextus {{told him}} that he should have done it without asking him <b>because</b> <b>he</b> now <b>could</b> <b>not</b> break his treaty oath made to the triumvirs.|$|R
50|$|Royal {{grew up in}} Green Cove Springs, Florida. He did {{not attend}} high school, and instead was homeschooled. He later {{attended}} St. Johns River State College's Florida School of the Arts, where he majored in acting, but quit after two years <b>because</b> <b>he</b> felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> act.|$|R
5|$|As governor, Seward {{incurred}} considerable {{personal debt}} {{not only because}} he had to live beyond his salary to maintain the lifestyle expected of the office, but also <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> pay down his obligation from the land company purchase. At the time he left office, he owed $200,000. Returning to Auburn, he absorbed himself in a profitable law practice. He did not abandon politics, and received former president Adams at the Seward family home in 1843.|$|E
5|$|Burr, sensing {{an attack}} on his honor, and {{recovering}} from his defeat, demanded an apology in letter form. Hamilton wrote a letter in response and ultimately refused <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> recall the instance of insulting Burr. Hamilton would also {{have been accused of}} recanting Cooper's letter out of cowardice. After a series of attempts to reconcile were to no avail, a duel was arranged through liaisons on June 27, 1804.|$|E
5|$|The {{family lived}} in Norman until Warren was 11, when they moved to Oklahoma City. When she was 12, her father, a {{salesman}} at Montgomery Ward, had a heart attack—which led to many medical bills, {{as well as a}} pay cut <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> do his previous work. Eventually, this led to the loss of their car from failure to make loan payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work in the catalog order department at Sears. When she was 13, Warren started waiting tables at her aunt's restaurant.|$|E
5000|$|Justin Fashanu—gay English soccer player, {{charged with}} sexual assault in Maryland. His suicide note denied the charges, {{stating that the}} sex was consensual, {{and that he had}} fled to England <b>because</b> <b>he</b> felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get a fair trial because of his homosexuality, and it added [...] "I {{realised}} that I had already been presumed guilty. I do not want to give any more embarrassment to my friends and family." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lord North did not resign {{office for}} any reason but <b>because</b> <b>he</b> [...] <b>could</b> <b>not</b> help it, being driven from it by some adverse votes of [...] the House of Commons, to which he {{submitted}} with great good [...] humour, and probably with satisfaction.|$|R
5000|$|On July 17, 1936, {{he married}} Katherine Emily Roberts, a Beverly Hills debutante and a {{graduate}} of Radcliffe College. After their wedding, they moved to White Plains, New York. They separated on March 15, 1939. Katherine Thaw sued her husband for cruelty and [...] "refusal to live with her". Their divorce was finalized on July 8, 1941, with Katherine Thaw stating that her husband had separated from her <b>because</b> <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> support them both.|$|R
5|$|Wilhelm was one {{of eleven}} {{children}} born to poor tenant farmers John and Ethel (née Stanley) Wilhelm in Huntersville, North Carolina. He played baseball at Cornelius High School in Cornelius, North Carolina. There, he began experimenting with a knuckleball after reading about pitcher Dutch Leonard. He felt that, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> throw fast, honing a knuckleball offered him his best shot at success. He used a tennis ball to practice.|$|E
5|$|After {{thirteen}} months, poverty forced Johnson {{to leave}} Oxford {{without taking a}} degree, and he returned to Lichfield. During his last weeks at Oxford, Jorden left Pembroke, and Johnson was given William Adams as a tutor in his place. He enjoyed Adams as a tutor, but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and {{he was forced to}} return home. He left behind many of the books that his father had previously lent him, both <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford the expense of transporting all of them and as a symbolic gesture that he hoped to return to the school soon.|$|E
5|$|Bakshi chose {{rotoscoping}} as {{a cost-effective}} way {{to complete the}} movie's battle scenes with his own finances. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford to hire a film crew or actors, or develop 35mm stock, Bakshi requested prints of films that contained the type of large battle scenes needed, including Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, and spliced together the footage he needed. However, the cost of printing photographs of each frame would have cost $3 million. Learning that IBM had introduced an industrial-sized photocopier, Bakshi {{asked one of the}} company's technical experts if {{he would be able to}} feed 35mm reels into the machine to produce enlarged copies of each frame. The experiment worked, and Bakshi got the pages he needed for a penny per copy.|$|E

60|$|The amateur detective {{was a boy}} who had {{but little}} faith in the honesty of his fellows, perhaps <b>because</b> <b>he</b> himself <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be trusted implicitly, and even though Joe Potter had solemnly promised he would say nothing in his disfavour, Dan entertained grave suspicions that the little woman was being prejudiced against him.|$|R
5000|$|On 10 December 2010, Michel {{was hired}} {{head coach of}} the Equatorial Guinea to lead the team for 2012 Africa Cup of Nations they will co-host with Gabon. He {{suddenly}} resigned from his post on 19 October 2011, with the Africa Cup of Nations three months away, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have {{the best players in the}} country, but five days later he was rehired thanks to the dismissal of Sports Minister Ruslan Obiang Nsue. On 21 December 2011, he resigned as coach of Equatorial Guinea again, citing interference from a [...] "third party" [...] as the reason for his departure.|$|R
5|$|Perlman, a {{frequent}} collaborator with director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, {{said in a}} 2009 AMC Networks featurette that Alien Resurrection was his only film in which he feared for his life. During the filming of the underwater scene, Perlman struggled with the aquatic set and nearly drowned <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> reach its openings. In a character-breaking occurrence, Perlman nearly compromised a shot of Sigourney Weaver making a basket from behind but editor Hervé Schneid was able to remove Perlman's reaction from the scene. In From Alien to The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, Roz Kaveney interprets Johner and Number 8 as monogamous animals, with a weaker, aggressive male unsuccessfully attempting to seduce a stronger female.|$|E
5|$|Sir William Rae, the Lord Advocate, {{followed}} a regular technique: {{he focused on}} one individual to extract a confession on which the others could be convicted. Hare was chosen and, on 1 December, he was offered immunity from prosecution if he turned king's evidence and provided the full details {{of the murder of}} Docherty and any other; <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be brought to testify against his wife, she was also exempt from prosecution. Hare made a full confession of all the deaths and Rae decided sufficient evidence existed to secure a prosecution. On 4 December formal charges were lain against Burke and McDougal for the murders of Mary Paterson, James Wilson and Mrs Docherty.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev {{conspired to}} oust Podgorny from the {{collective}} leadership {{as early as}} 1970. The reason was simple: Brezhnev was third, while Podgorny was first in the ranking of Soviet diplomatic protocol; Podgorny's removal would have made Brezhnev head of state, and his political power would have increased significantly. For much of the period, however, Brezhnev was unable to have Podgorny removed, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> count on enough votes in the Politburo, since the removal of Podgorny would have meant weakening of {{the power and the}} prestige of the collective leadership itself. Indeed, Podgorny continued to acquire greater power as the head of state throughout the early 1970s, due to Brezhnev's liberal stance on Yugoslavia and his disarmament talks with some Western powers, policies which many Soviet officials saw as contrary to common communist principles.|$|E

60|$|I renewed my {{trade as}} soon as out of the Black Hole, but did not give {{up the idea of}} escaping. Leonard Lewis and Jack Mallet were the only men we let into the secret. They both {{declined}} joining us; Mallet on account of his dread of the water, and Lewis, <b>because</b> certain <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> outlive the fatigue; but they wished us good luck, and aided us all they could. With Johnson we would have no further concern.|$|R
50|$|Govan {{himself has}} said that he was not very {{interested}} in releasing a solo album under the assumption that there was no market for it and <b>because</b> <b>he</b> himself <b>could</b> <b>not</b> fund it. That was when Paul Cornford pushed him to record and told him that he would personally fund it. Cornford then picked Jan Cyrka to produce and mix the album as well as getting a good studio for the guitars.|$|R
5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> see the washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E
5|$|In December 1888, the Chiswick Press {{published}} Morris' The House of the Wolfings, {{a fantasy}} story set in Iron Age Europe {{which provides a}} reconstructed portrait {{of the lives of}} Germanic-speaking Gothic tribes. It contained both prose and aspects of poetic verse. A sequel, The Roots of the Mountains, followed in 1890. Over the coming years he would publish a string of other poetic works; The Story of the Glittering Plain (1890), The Wood Beyond the World (1894), The Well at the World's End (1896), The Water of the Wondrous Isles (1897) and The Sundering Flood (1898). He also embarked on a translation of the Anglo-Saxon tale, Beowulf; <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> fully understand Old English, his poetic translation was based largely on that already produced by A.J. Watts. On publication, Morris' Beowulf would be critically panned. Following the death of the sitting Poet Laureate of Great Britain and Ireland, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, in October 1892, Morris was offered the position, but turned it down, disliking its associations with the monarchy and political establishment; instead the position went to Alfred Austin.|$|E
5|$|The 1973–74 season saw {{the arrival}} of a new player in Johan Cruyff, who was bought for a world record £920,000 from Ajax. Already an {{established}} player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> play for a club associated with Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son Jordi, after the local Catalan Saint George. Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973–74 season {{for the first time since}} 1960, defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu along the way. He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.|$|E

5|$|The strongman behind Haakon's monarchy {{had been}} his foster-father Tore Tordsson ("Steigar-Tore"), who refused to {{recognise}} Magnus as king after Haakon's death. With Egil Aslaksson and other noblemen, he had the otherwise-unknown Sweyn Haraldsson set up as a pretender. Although later sagas maintain that Sweyn was Danish, some modern historians have speculated {{that he may have}} been a son of Harald Hardrada. The revolt was based in the Uplands, but also gained support from noblemen elsewhere in the country. After several weeks of fighting, Magnus captured Tore and his supporters and had them hanged on the island of Vambarholm (outside Hamnøy, Lofoten, in northern Norway). Magnus was reportedly furious <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> pardon Egil, a potentially useful, young and resourceful nobleman. As king, his honour would only allow a pardon if other noblemen pleaded for Egil's life; this did not happen.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{six months}} after filming began, Yuvan Shankar Raja left the project, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{spend as much time}} on this film as Selvaraghavan wanted. Subsequently, the role of the music {{director}} was handed to G. V. Prakash Kumar, for whom Aayirathil Oruvan became his biggest project to that point. Rambo Rajkumar, the film's stunt director, died in April 2009 and was posthumously praised for his action choreography. The film's music released two months later to much appraisal in a well-held audio release function. Soon after the filming finished, the lead actors moved onto other projects as did Selvaraghavan whilst post-production continued. In August 2009, Selvaraghavan divorced his wife, Sonia Agarwal with his close proximity to Andrea being a speculated cause. During the period, G. V. Prakash Kumar and Selva also worked on the music in Mumbai whilst re-recording was also held in Austria and London. Towards the end of the year, the film began to announce release date of Christmas which was later further delayed to coincide with the Pongal festival. A date clash occurred with Karthi's Paiyaa, with an eventual hearing leading to the Karthi's latter film being delayed. Throughout December 2009, release work began with a trailer and promotional songs being released on 13 December. The film was subsequently certified {{before the end of the}} year by the Central Board of Film Certification and settled with an adult rating, after Selvaraghavan refused to remove some gory scenes. On 31 December, it was announced that the film was sold worldwide for 350million rupees for theatrical, television and other rights.|$|E
5|$|The ship briefly {{operated}} between Glasgow {{and other}} ports in Scotland for Hutcheson's West Highland Service {{before she was}} purchased in September 1861 by James D. Bulloch, the primary foreign agent in Great Britain for the Confederacy, to deliver the military and naval ordnance and supplies that he had purchased. To disguise his control of Fingal, and the destination of her cargo, Bulloch hired an English crew and captain and put out his destination as Bermuda and Nassau in the Bahamas. The cargo was loaded in Greenock in early October, although Bullock and the other passengers would not attempt to board until they rendezvoused with the ship at Holyhead, Wales. On the night 14/15 October, as she was slowly rounding the breakwater at Holyhead, Fingal rammed and sank the Austrian brig Siccardi, slowly swinging at anchor without lights. Bulloch and the passengers embarked in the steamer while Bulloch dispatched {{a letter to his}} financial agents instructing them to settle damages with the brig's owners <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford {{to take the time to}} deal with the affair lest he and Fingal be detained. The ship reached Bermuda on 2 November and, after leaving port on 7 November, Bulloch informed the crew that the steamer's real destination was Savannah, Georgia; he offered to take anyone who objected to the plan to Nassau. However, all of the crew agreed to join in the effort to run the Union blockade. Fingal was able slip safely into the Savannah estuary in a heavy fog on the night of 12 November without sighting any blockaders.|$|E

He had been hiding there for around a year. According to Sabah and Radikal, interior minister Sadettin Tantan discovered Evcil was hiding in Bursa, and after some political difficulty moved the Bursa Governor Orhan Taşanlar and the Bursa Chief of Police, Kemal Bayrak, to positions outside Bursa. Only then did he order the new Chief of Police to detain Evcil. Evcil later admitted that he had received warning of an earlier raid, from a high-ranking Bursa police officer. He also said he ordered the murder of moneylender Nesim Malki <b>because</b> <b>he</b> realised <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> pay him back.|$|R
