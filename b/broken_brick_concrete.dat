Garden beds and path edges were built up and retained with flat and smooth river stones. A variety of materials were used for paving in this area: <b>bricks,</b> <b>broken</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs set into the path, and concrete [...] "crazy paving". Walking areas such as footbridges and steps were rendered [...] "non-slip" [...] with the application of exposed aggregate concrete.|$|R

40|$|A cementious material, coded CSBR (Carbide residue Spent {{bleaching}} earth <b>Broken</b> <b>bricks</b> and Rice husks), {{was made}} from dried calcium carbide residue (DCCR) and an incinerated mix of rice husks (RH), <b>broken</b> <b>bricks</b> (BB) and spent bleaching earth (SBE). Another material, coded SBR (Spent bleaching earth <b>Broken</b> <b>bricks</b> and Rice husk ash), {{was made from}} mixing separately incinerated RH, SBE and ground BB in the same ash ratio as in CSBR. When CSBR was inter-ground with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), it showed a continued decrease in Ca(OH) 2 in the hydrating cement {{as a function of}} curing time and replacement levels of the cement. Up to 45 % replacement of the OPC by CSBR produced a Portland pozzolana cement (PPC) material that passed the relevant Kenyan Standard. Incorporation of the CSBR in OPC reduces the resultant calcium hydroxide from hydrating Portland cement. The use of the waste materials in production of cementitious material would rid the environment of wastes and lead to production of low cost cementitious material...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Researches {{has been}} {{conducted}} worldwide on {{a large number of}} natural or artificial lightweight aggregates. In spite of many of the researches of using natural fibers show considerable promise, the use of natural fibers to improve the properties of lightweight concrete still required to be a subject of further research and investigation. Approach: This experimental investigation was carried out to study the properties of lightweight crushed <b>brick</b> <b>concrete</b> containing palm fiber of different volume fractions. An experimental programme was planned in which the tests such as density, compressive strength and flexural strength were conducted to investigate the properties of lightweight crushed <b>brick</b> <b>concrete</b> reinforced by palm fiber. The specimen incorporated different volume fractions of palm fiber, i. e., 0, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8 and 1. 0 %. Results: Tests results showed that the use of this fiber slightly increases the density of lightweight concrete. The use of 0. 8 % of palm fiber increases the compressive strength and flexural strength by about 13. 4 and 16. 1 % respectively. Conclusion: The results indicated that the use of palm fiber with lightweight crushed <b>brick</b> <b>concrete</b> enhances the mechanical properties of the concrete and the optimization of the palm fiber fractions is required to get the best performance...|$|R
