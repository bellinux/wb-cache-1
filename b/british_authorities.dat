5|$|Darwaza {{was one of}} the {{principal}} organizers of the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine which first erupted in his hometown of Nablus with the launch of the Palestinian general strike. Along with Abd al-Hadi, Darwaza was arrested by the <b>British</b> <b>authorities</b> in June and imprisoned in the military camp at Sarafand al-Amar. The Mufti sent a delegation consisting of Darwaza, Mu'in al-Madi, and Abd al-Hadi to Baghdad, then to Riyadh to discuss the situation and upon their return on 6 January 1937, they revealed that the advice given to them was to cease hostilities. During the revolt, in 1937, Darwaza was exiled from Palestine by <b>British</b> <b>authorities</b> to Damascus. Later in that year, Darwaza held several meetings with Nuri al-Sa'id of Iraq to explore various solutions to help the Arabs avoid appearing intransigent.|$|E

There is no record of Buffalo participating.|$|E

5|$|Although the <b>British</b> <b>authorities</b> had {{prohibited}} the American Neo-Nazi George Lincoln Rockwell {{from entering the}} UK, the NSM managed to smuggle him in via Ireland to attend a summer camp in August 1962. There, the NSM {{took part in the}} formation of the World Union of National Socialists (WUNS), at which Jordan was elected 'world führer' and Rockwell as his heir. Among those in attendance were the Neo-Nazi Savitri Devi and the former SS officer Fred Borth.|$|E

In 1869, John Boyle O'Reilly escaped on the American whaling ship Gazelle and settled in Boston.

At the time Soviet authorities saw those people who maintained contacts with the West as untrustworthy.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer {{was taken}} {{prisoner}} of war by the British Army in Schleswig-Holstein in May 1945. According to Schumann, {{he was taken to}} England for interrogation. In this account <b>British</b> <b>authorities</b> were especially interested in knowing whether his achievements had been made under the influence of methamphetamine or other stimulating psychoactive drugs which induce temporary improvements in either mental or physical functions or both. He was released later that year in November following a bout of diphtheria.|$|E
5|$|The Irish and <b>British</b> <b>authorities</b> co-operated in the {{chartering}} of ships. They made combined {{purchases of}} wheat, maize, sugar, animal feeds and petrol. At {{the start of}} the war, Irish ships joined convoys protected by the Royal Navy. The advantages were protection and cheaper insurance. These advantages were not borne out by experience. So they chose to sail alone.|$|E

5|$|The {{last two}} {{conditions}} {{were the most}} controversial, though after {{one and a half}} years, a compromise was reached: only buildings actually in use would be repaired, and pensions would be paid, but only when the officers actually retired. The <b>British</b> <b>authorities</b> authorised minimal repairs, to be made as cheaply as possible. The transfer was intended to be completed by the end of 1885, but was not finalised until 31 March 1886.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{bridge was}} {{built over the}} Lakhish River (Wadi Sukrir/Wadi Fakhira) during the Roman period, and re-built by the Ottoman Empire {{at the end of}} the 19th century. A parallel railway bridge was added when the coastal railway (Lebanon–Egypt) was laid. After numerous armed raids in the area during the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the <b>British</b> <b>authorities</b> set up a series of pillboxes in the area, one of them next to the bridges.|$|E
5|$|The {{terms of}} {{surrender}} {{were that the}} British and their camp followers {{would be allowed to}} withdraw, under French escort, to Fort Edward, with the full honours of war, on condition that they refrain from fighting for 18 months.

50|$|The Kondh {{rebellion}} under Dora and Chakra {{is significant}} {{in the history of}} Odisha in particular and India in general. The role played by both Dora and Chakra in this Tribal uprising was commendable. However, it is beyond doubt that this tribal rebellion of the Kondhs had given a tough challenge to the <b>British</b> <b>authority</b> {{in the early part of}} the British administration in Odisha. Although, the rebellion could not bring much result, but it had the shaken the <b>British</b> <b>authority</b> in Odisha and would find resonance in the Great Mutiny of 1857.|$|R
50|$|In 1825, Baker {{petitioned the}} state of Maine for Madawaska's {{inclusion}} in the state. Believing fervently that the territory belonged to Maine, Baker became known as an agitator and provocateur toward the British government. In 1827, Baker provoked the New Brunswick authorities by attempting to stop the mail being sent by canoe from Madawaska to Quebec by the St.John River, by {{trying to get the}} French residents of Madawaska to reject <b>British</b> <b>authority,</b> by preventing a constable from carrying out an arrest, as well as other such defiance of <b>British</b> <b>authority.</b>|$|R
5|$|After the new Burgundians realise {{they are}} not subject to post-war {{rationing}} or other bureaucratic restrictions, the district is quickly flooded with black marketeers and shoppers; Spiller is unable to handle the rising problems by himself. In response, the <b>British</b> <b>authorities</b> surround the Burgundian territory with barbed wire. The residents retaliate against what they see as heavy-handed bureaucratic action; they stop a London Underground train as it passes through Burgundy, and ask to see passports of all passengers: those without documents are unable to proceed.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Black Osprey, still registered in the neutral-United States, was seized by <b>British</b> <b>authorities</b> on 6 September and detained at Weymouth. After carefully inspecting the ship for any contraband, the British released the ship after a week. However, on 31 October, the British again seized Black Osprey, and had not yet released her by 8 November, when the U.S. State Department released a list of 40 American ships that had been detained by belligerents.|$|E
5|$|Bani Na'im grew {{considerably}} in population {{during the early}} 20th century. In 1936, the town participated in the Arab revolt against the <b>British</b> <b>authorities.</b> In December 1937, British forces ordered the demolition of a house whose owners were accused of involvement in an anti-British incident near the town. They fined Bani Na'im's mukhtars (town chiefs) 50 British pounds and ordered the residents to carry 200 kilograms of explosives to the building for its demolition and watch the explosion as a deterrent measure.|$|E

5|$|Countershading is {{less often}} used for {{military}} camouflage, despite Second World War experiments that showed its effectiveness. English zoologist Hugh Cott encouraged the use of techniques including countershading, but despite his authority on the subject, failed to persuade the <b>British</b> <b>authorities.</b> Soldiers often wrongly viewed camouflage netting {{as a kind of}} invisibility cloak, and they had to be taught to look at camouflage practically, from the enemy observer's point of view. At the same time in Australia, zoologist William John Dakin advised soldiers to copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.|$|E
5|$|From late 1987, the <b>British</b> <b>authorities</b> {{were aware}} that the IRA was {{planning}} to detonate a bomb at {{the changing of the}} guard ceremony outside the governor's residence in the British Dependent Territory of Gibraltar. When Savage, McCann and Farrell—known IRA members—travelled to Spain in preparation for the attack, they were tracked {{at the request of the}} British government. On the day of the shootings, Savage was seen parking a white Renault in the car park used as the assembly area for the parade; McCann and Farrell were seen crossing the border shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In late 1939, he {{was accused}} by French {{military}} authorities of helping Palestinian rebels in the revolt, tried by a military court, and sentenced to five years imprisonment in the Citadel of Damascus. While his exile by the British abruptly curtailed his political life, his imprisonment {{marked the beginning of}} a new life wherein the Quran becomes a major concern for the next several years. He was released in November 1944. After his release, Darwaza was unable to return to Nablus because <b>British</b> <b>authorities</b> had issued an order preventing him from entering Palestine. As a result, he left for Turkey, mostly staying in Bursa until the end of 1945.|$|E
