40|$|The type of this {{research}} is case study research at Ratu Supermarket Malang with title “Waiting Line Analysis to Get the Optimize Rate Service <b>of</b> <b>cashier</b> at Ratu Supermarket Malang”. A waiting line is a phenomenon that usually happen in almost firms or industry of service. A waiting line forms because of a temporary imbalance between the demand for service and the capacity of the system to provide the service. Company usually won’t lose the customers, so that company needs to increase their service by giving the service as fast as they can. To rich that purpose, waiting line theory can use to evaluating that problem and make some alternative solutions. The purpose of {{this research}} is to analyzing the waiting line and to get the optimize number <b>of</b> <b>cashier</b> at Ratu Supermarket Malang in first and middle of the month. The day research period split in three time period, morning, afternoon, and evening research time. The used analysis tool in the research is waiting line models. This model is used to know how much number <b>of</b> facilities (<b>cashier)</b> need to handle the arriving rate of customer at Ratu Supermarket Malang. There are some formula to to describe the operating characteristics of the service system in the waiting line model; average utilization of the system (ρ), probability that zero customers are in the system (Po), average number of customers in line (Lq), average waiting time of customers in line (Wq), average time spent in the system (Ws), average number of customers in the service system (Ls). The result {{of this research}} shows that in the weekend afternoon at start of the month need a cashier additional from 9 to 10 cashiers. In the middle of the month, top-level <b>of</b> <b>cashier</b> used are 10 cashier in the sunday afternoon.

40|$|This study {{proposed}} an incorporated simulation–Taguchi model to optimize a petrol station sales rate. In addition, {{it provided a}} regression model to forecast the sales rate. Initially, Witness 2014 simulation software© was used to simulate the operating system of a petrol station. Next, the obtained simulation results were used as the input for Taguchi method to optimize the process. Taguchi L 4 standard orthogonal array was taken to optimize the petrol station parameters including the number of pumps, number <b>of</b> <b>cashiers</b> and customers’ interarrival times (IATs) to obtain a better sales rate. Three noise factors such as petrol station location, different cashiers and different dispensers considered as potential factors affecting the response. Based on Taguchi methodology, number of pumps and IAT were identified as highly contributing factors on the sales rate. The remaining factor (number <b>of</b> <b>cashier)</b> similarly influences the response, but the effect is not very significant. Therefore, the importance sequence of the sales rate parameter is IATs > number of pumps > number <b>of</b> <b>cashiers.</b> The regression equation was formulated to maximize the sales rate (Liter) and then verified by the confirmation runs...|$|R

Two-level full factorial experiments with center points were performed where the simulated model parameter studied were number of pump, number <b>of</b> <b>cashier</b> and inter arrival times (IATs). The response variables analyzed were queue length and sales rate. The obtained model from experimental design revealed that number <b>of</b> <b>cashier</b> and inter arrival time were significant in determining the queue length while all the factors and their interaction were significantly affecting the sales rate...|$|R

50|$|The {{failure of}} a firm of De Neufville’s size - almost half {{as large as the}} Bank of Amsterdam itself - shocked the markets.

Traditionally, the cashiers had served as brokers in the market for bank funds. By {{the last half of the}} eighteenth century, their activities had expanded to include settlement of bills denominated in current guilders, deposit taking, and even the issue <b>of</b> <b>cashier’s</b> receipts that circulated locally as bank notes. The cashiers were run hard during the first days of the crisis, as panicked holders <b>of</b> <b>cashier’s</b> receipts demanded coin from the issuers. The contraction of the bill market put the Amsterdam merchant bankers under heavy pressure, as their ability to roll over funding was several constricted.|$|R

This study tests emotional dissonance – the demand to keep being polite to impolite customers – as an additional risk factor. Furthermore, sleep problems are expected to mediate the link between emotion work and musculoskeletal pain. Data contains 103 female supermarket cashiers from three supermarkets of a large retailer responded to a questionnaire (participation rate 60. 6 %). An open question asked for the most negative job facets in daily work. Standardized questionnaire were used to assess emotional dissonance, sleep problems and musculoskeletal pain. Responses to the open question showed experience of unkind customers as the most prevalent negative experience at work reported by 47. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>cashiers,</b> followed by prolonged sitting (8. 7 %). Emotional dissonance {{was a significant predictor of}} neck and back pain when BMI, age, part-time work, and change of hand function during their shift (work rotation) were controlled (β =. 30, p <. 01). Moreover, sleep problems were confirmed as a mediator with respect to neck and back pain (B =. 21, SE =. 10, CI = 02 –. 22). No mediation was found in prediction of pain in arms and shoulders or hips, legs, and feet.
