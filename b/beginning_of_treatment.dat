25|$|Precautions {{should be}} taken in {{patients}} with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics along with other medications that affect blood sugar levels and should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. The liquid form (oral solution) of this medication may contain up to 15 grams of sugar per dose. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia (excessive thirst), polyuria (excessive urination), polyphagia (increased appetite), and weakness.|$|E
25|$|Each {{treatment}} has disadvantages that limit {{its use in}} certain circumstances. Although orchiectomy is a low-risk surgery, the psychological impact of removing the testicles can be significant, and sterility is certain. The loss of testosterone can cause hot flashes, weight gain, loss of libido, enlargement of the breasts (gynecomastia), impotence, penile atrophy, and osteoporosis. GnRH agonists eventually cause the same side effects as orchiectomy but may cause worse symptoms at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> When GnRH agonists are first used, testosterone surges can lead to increased bone pain from metastatic cancer, so antiandrogens or abarelix is often added to blunt these side effects. Estrogens are not commonly used because they increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and blood clots. In general, the antiandrogens do not cause impotence, and usually cause less loss of bone and muscle mass. Ketoconazole can cause liver damage with prolonged use, and aminoglutethimide can cause skin rashes.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{child should}} be {{examined}} physically at least once at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> A full paediatric and neuorological exam is recommended. Measurement of blood pressure is important to rule out any renal pathology. External genitalia and lumbosacral spine should be examined thoroughly. [...] A spinal defect, such as a dimple, hair tuft, or skin discoloration, might be visible in approximately 50% of patients with an intraspinal lesion. Thorough neurologic examination of the lower extremities, including gait, muscle power, tone, sensation, reflexes, and plantar responses should be done during first visit.|$|E
2500|$|Antidepressants (SSRIs, MAOIs, {{tricyclic}} antidepressants and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors): {{these are}} taken regularly every day, and alter neurotransmitter configurations {{which in turn}} can help to block symptoms. [...] Although these medications are described as [...] "antidepressants", {{nearly all of them}} — especially the tricyclic antidepressants — have anti-anxiety properties, in part, due to their sedative effects. SSRIs have been known to exacerbate symptoms in panic disorder patients, especially in the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> and have even provoked panic attacks in otherwise healthy individuals. [...] SSRIs are also known to produce withdrawal symptoms which include rebound anxiety and panic attacks. [...] Comorbid depression has been cited as imparting the worst course, leading to chronic, disabling illness.|$|E
