Mac became close with the editor of Brava magazine (a part of Cory Publishing), Janice Frame (Christine Jones), who was also Steve's sister. Rachel and Mac began fighting regularly, which eventually led to a divorce. Janice and Mac married, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>only</b> wanted him for his money.

25|$|Jones {{began the}} 2009 indoor season in Europe, scoring {{victories}} in the 60m hurdles with world-leading times of 7.82seconds in Karlsruhe and Birmingham. She returned to the States and won the national indoor title in the 60m hurdles. A hamstring injury at her hometown meet, the Drake Relays, caused her to miss a month's worth of training but she returned {{in time for the}} outdoor national championships. She did not repeat her indoor success, however, as her arms collided with Michelle Perry in the semi-finals and fell, missing out on the opportunity to compete at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin. Vowing to salvage her season, she returned to Europe to compete on the major World Athletics Tour meets, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>only</b> finished seventh and eighth in Oslo and Lausanne. She returned to form in Rethymno, beating Priscilla Lopes-Schliep and Damu Cherry with a world-leading time of 12.47seconds.|$|E
25|$|Upon commencing her tests Curtiss {{found that}} {{although}} Genie's comprehension was clearly {{ahead of her}} production, it was only slightly ahead. Genie had begun to diversify her two-word utterances to include sentences in either subject-verb or verb-object order, suggesting she was grasping the subject–verb–object sentence structure typically used in English, and could follow other basic word order rules as evidenced in her verb-complement sentences. While Genie did not use plural forms of words and could not distinguish between plural and singular words or inflections, by October 1971 she clearly distinguished between one versus more than one object and understood numbers and quantitative descriptors. She also started using some regular past tense forms of weak verbs. On tests she consistently did better recognizing and responding to the conjugations of irregular past tense verbs and strong verbs, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>only</b> started to use these forms, either in imitation or in spontaneous speech, in 1973, and they remained limited.|$|E

25|$|Her {{following}} two seasons were low profile, with 2005 being highlighted by a 100m win in Salamanca, and 2006 {{performances in the}} 200m including a win at the Reebok Grand Prix and a fifth-place finish at the USA Track and Field Championships. She began training with Olympic gold medalist Jon Drummond during this period. Her Olympic year form returned in 2007, which she began with personal record-equalling run of 11.26seconds at the Mt. SAC Relays and an outright 200m best of 22.46seconds to finish as runner-up at the Adidas Track Classic. She finished fourth in the 200m at the 2007 US Outdoor National Championships, but {{due to the fact}} that the race winner (Allyson Felix) was automatically qualified for the 2007 World Championships in Athletics as the reigning world champion, Moore gained a position on the US team. She went on to be one of four American women to reach the 2007 World 200m final (along with Felix, Sanya Richards and Torri Edwards) <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>only</b> managed seventh place with a below-peak form run of 22.97seconds. After making appearances in the 2007 IAAF Golden League, at the ISTAF and Memorial van Damme meetings, she closed the season by winning a bronze medal at the 2007 IAAF World Athletics Final – her first global senior medal.|$|E

Unbeknownst to her, he is Cane's biological {{father and the}} head of an organized crime syndicate in Australia. Cane was shot and [...] "killed" [...] on the day of her wedding to Colin, however it was actually Caleb (Cane's twin) that died. Jill found out that Colin was married to a woman named Genevieve Atkinson (Genie Francis), Cane's mother. Jill ended things with Colin and he was sent to jail for his crimes. In 2012, Jill leaves town for several months to help Phillip in Australia. Upon her return, she agrees to help Katherine come out of retirement to take control of Chancellor Industries, but Katherine ends up with a brain tumor. She has the tumor successfully removed and leaves town indefinitely with Murphy. Murphy later returns to Genoa City alone, revealing Katherine died while they were away. She leaves Nikki and Jill in charge of her funeral arrangements, and during this time Jill begins trying to figure out cryptic messages left by Katherine in a personal letter to her. Jill expected Katherine to have left everything to her in her will, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>only</b> ends up with the Chancellor Estate, for which she can't afford the upkeep, and a mysterious music box. Jill tries for months to figure out the meaning of the music box and finally decides to sell it online, only to have Esther (Kate Linder) buy it back for her as she believes it truly means something.|$|E
500|$|Mega Man 3 {{brought new}} {{characters}} and gameplay mechanics to the franchise. Though Inafune considers the gameplay {{to have lost}} some of its simplicity, he felt Mega Man's slide ability was successfully implemented to enhance the player's control while battling enemies. Mega Man's sidekick dog Rush was designed by combining the functionality of three support tools from Mega Man 2, which would ease the player's navigation of stages. In addition to the Marine and Coil modes, Rush was originally intended to have a [...] "drill" [...] mode that would allow Mega Man to tunnel underground. Another new character, Proto Man, was introduced {{in a way that the}} player would be unable to tell if he was an ally or an enemy to Mega Man. His design was influenced by anime, and he was given both a scarf and shield to make him appear [...] "tougher" [...] than Mega Man. The design team wanted Proto Man to sport uncovered hair, but they instead opted for an open-faced helmet illustration for both the television commercials and instruction manual. Proto Man's original Japanese name, Blues, was changed by Capcom's North American division despite Inafune's protests. Capcom did this not only to be consistent with Rockman's English name, but because they thought that the name Blues made no sense. Inafune attempted to defend it due to the name's musical connotation to character names in the series. Though Rush and Proto Man were created solely by the developer, Capcom sought ideas from fans for the creation of the game's Robot Masters as they had done with Mega Man 2. The team received around 50,000 design submissions for Mega Man 3, only eight of which were used in the game. Harumi Fujita, credited as [...] "Mrs. Tarumi", was the initial composer of the game, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>only</b> completed a few songs before giving birth and having to drop off the project. She composed the songs ‘Needle Man’, ‘Gemini Man’ and ‘Staff Roll’. Capcom composer Yasuaki Fujita, also known as [...] "Bun Bun" [...] was then assigned to complete the soundtrack and created the majority of the score.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with most}} {{previous}} new buildings of Viking Line, {{the details of}} the ship's interior design were entrusted to Robert Tillberg of Tillberg Design. Due to the ship's larger size, her onboard services could be greatly upgraded from the previous generation ships, with accommodation and public spaces close to the standards of the time's cruise ships. For the first time on a Viking Line ship trafficking between continental Finland and Sweden, the ship included an à la carte restaurant in addition to the traditional buffet (Rederi AB Slite's cruise ship [...] had an à la carte restaurant since 1976, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>only</b> trafficked between the Åland islands and Sweden). SF Line's new ship was also given large conference facilities by the day's standards, capable of hosting 80 people.|$|E

2500|$|During December 1915 and January 1916 Lord Clive was {{stationed}} in the Thames Estuary to shoot down approaching German Zeppelins with shrapnel shells fired by her main guns, but she was denied a chance to waste ammunition when the Zeppelins never came within range. She bombarded German batteries at Westende on 26 January using the newly developed air-spotting techniques, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>only</b> fired about eleven rounds during the half-hour bombardment. This was the last bombardment {{for the next seven}} months as the monitors were used to support British light forces, minefields and net defenses in the Channel. Lord Clive was refitted during this period with a pair of six-inch guns to enhance her armament against German ships. This came in handy on 8 June when she, along with other monitors and destroyers, rebuffed an attempt by a dozen German ships to clear the nets and sweep the minefields. Lord Clive participated in a deception operation on 8 July when she, as well as French [...] guns, fired blanks to cover the fire of the brand-new 12-inch Dominion Battery at Adinkerke bombarding the Tirpitz Battery. She was fitted with dummy second funnel to make the Germans think that she was a new monitor. The idea was to deceive the Germans as to the true origin of the shells landing around the battery, but the Germans were not totally deceived and retaliated against the French guns. Shortly afterwards they deployed a smokescreen to hide the battery which hampered spotting and they also located the Dominion Battery and fired against it.|$|E
