5|$|Patroclus was {{a leading}} {{official}} and admiral under Ptolemy II, {{best known for his}} activity during the Chremonidean War (267–261 BC). His early career is obscure, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been distinguished enough for him to rise to the chief priesthood of Alexander and the Theoi Adelphoi in 271/270 BC. After the outbreak of the Chremonidean War, he led a diplomatic and military expedition to the Aegean Sea that expanded Ptolemaic control by establishing bases at Crete, Ceos, Thera, Attica and the Argolid. From these bases he tried, without much success, to aid the Athenians against Antigonus II Gonatas, King of Macedon. He may have been the defeated Ptolemaic commander at the Battle of Cos, which marked the end of Ptolemaic thalassocracy.|$|E
5|$|In late March, West Nohno {{began the}} first of three Boston–Liverpool round trips. On the Halifax–Liverpool leg of this first trip, she had some {{unspecified}} problem that required her return to Halifax, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been a minor problem since she sailed again for Liverpool a week later. The cargo ship returned to Boston on 3 June and began her second voyage to Liverpool on 30 June. While in the UK she called at Loch Ewe, Methil, and Oban in July and August before her 6 September return to Boston. Her third journey was an extended one that began by sailing from Boston on 3 October. She arrived at Liverpool three weeks later. During the next seven weeks, she made her way to Milford Haven, from which she began her last westbound transatlantic crossing on 13 December. West Nohno arrived in Boston on 5 January 1944.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to its {{proximity}} to the first Christian communities of Palestine, Provincia Arabia, of which Philippopolis was a part, {{was among the first}} regions to convert to Christianity. By the time of Philip's birth, the region had been extensively Christianized, especially in the north and in Hellenized settlements like those of Auranitis. The region is known to have had a fully developed synodal system (in which bishops from the dioceses in the region met to discuss Church affairs) by the mid-3rd century. The region sent six bishops to the Council of Nicaea in 325, and Eusebius' Onomasticon, a gazetteer of Biblical place-names, records a wholly Christian village called Cariathaim, or Caraiatha, near Madaba. Outside of the cities, however, there is less evidence of Christianization. Before the 5th century there is little evidence of the faith, and many villages remained unconverted in the 6th. Philippopolis, which was a small village for most of this period, does not have a Christian inscription that can be dated earlier than 552. It is not known when the village established a prelateship, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been sometime before 451, when it sent a bishop to the Council of Chalcedon.|$|E

25|$|The {{site of the}} Alban people Bolani is {{frequently}} mentioned by the historians Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Livy. It was occupied by the Aequians probably already in the late 6th century or in the wars led by Coriolanus. Its site is not known with certainty, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> stood not far from Praeneste and Labicum.|$|E
25|$|In August 1782 a corps was {{organised}} in 1782, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> disbanded soon afterwards. When, {{as an aid}} to recruiting, territorial {{links to}} infantry regiments were first established in 1782, the 6th became the 1st Warwickshire Regiment, reflecting their recent connections with the county. During the French Revolutionary Wars in 1794 in the West Indies, the 6th took part in the capture of Martinique, Guadeloupe and St Lucia from the French and in Casdebar in August 1798 they gained a Battle Honour.|$|E
25|$|The {{date of the}} {{introduction}} of this system is not known exactly, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> happened later than AD 200 but before {{the introduction}} of Christianity during the 6th to 7th centuries, i.e., during the final phase or soon {{after the collapse of}} the Western Roman Empire. This period is later than the Common Germanic stage, but still during the phase of undifferentiated West Germanic. The names of the days of the week in North Germanic languages were not calqued from Latin directly, but taken from the West Germanic names.|$|E

25|$|The name Σαλονίκη Saloníkē {{is first}} attested in Greek in the Chronicle of the Morea (14th century), and {{is common in}} folk songs, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> {{originated}} earlier, as al-Idrisi called it Salunik already in the 12th century.

25|$|A {{man named}} Baker Pierce, {{who died in}} 1815, and whose remains were buried in the old pioneer {{graveyard}} at Osceola, {{appears to have been}} the first settler within the boundaries of Elkland borough. Just when he settled or how long he remained cannot now be ascertained, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been during the earlier years of {{the first decade of the}} present century. The next to settle was the Taylor family, who located at Barney Hill. The family consisted of Mrs. Permelia Taylor and her three sons, Ebenezer, Philip and Mitchell, who emigrated from the Delaware Water Gap, New Jersey, to the Wyoming valley, thence to Pipe Creek, below Owego, from which place, in 1806, they came to the Cowanesque valley. Ebenezer and Philip soon afterward removed to Osceola. The latter, his mother and his brother, Mitchell, all died before 1815, and were buried at Barney Hill. In 1882, their resting place being disturbed by the building of the Addison and Pennsylvania railroad, Capt. Charles R. Taylor and Charles Tubbs—descendants in the fourth generation of Mrs. Permelia Taylor—removed their remains to the cemetery at Osceola.|$|E

In other words, when you are playing Mona, you are actually experiencing Max’s guess of the events". Regarding Mona's possible survival {{at the end of}} Max Payne 2, Rockstar's Dan Houser stated that Max Payne 3 would [...] "not continue that aspect of the story. We toyed with figuring out some way, or doing something clever, and then [...] 'No, no, just move on from that bit of the story.' It really didn't work because there was no way of knowing the choices someone made." ...|$|E

500|$|After Alfred's {{death in}} 899, Æthelwold made {{a bid for}} the throne. Janet Nelson {{comments}} that [...] "in {{the eyes of many}} Englishmen as well as Scandinavians this ætheling had claims stronger than Edward's own." [...] According to the 'A' version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Æthelwold abducted a nun from her convent without the permission of King Edward and against the command of the bishop. Her identity is not known, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been intended to strengthen his claim, and {{in the view of the}} historian Pauline Stafford, the Chronicle's account is biased in favour of Edward and might have been intended to delegitimise a politically important marriage. Æthelwold took her to the royal manors of Twynham (now Christchurch) and then Wimborne Minster, symbolically important as his father's burial place, and declared that [...] "he would live or die there". Lavelle sees Wimborne as strategically significant, close to Roman roads to Dorchester and Salisbury, and at a crossing point of the rivers Allen and Stour; it was the southernmost point for control of access to western Wessex and Æthelwold may have intended a division of the kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|Newcastle is not {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Book, as it grew up around the 12th century castle, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> rapidly become a place of importance because a charter, known only through a reference in another charter to Preston, was given to the town by Henry II in 1173. The new castle was built to supersede an older fortress at Chesterton about [...] to the north, the ruins of which were visible up {{to the end of the}} 16th century.|$|E

R. Woudhuysen's analysis of the undated manuscript suggests that his visit to Stratford was made not much later than 1617–18. The monument was restored in 1748–49 and has been repainted several times.|$|E

2500|$|Mahr (donatio propter nuptias) {{differs from}} a {{marriage}} dowry or gift in Western countries, {{in that it}} is mandatory for a Muslim marriage and is paid by the groom to the bride. The amount of money or possessions of the mahr is paid by the groom to the bride at the time of marriage for her exclusive use. The mahr {{does not have to be}} money, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> monetary value. Therefore [...] "it cannot be love, honesty, being faithful, etc., which are anyway traits of righteous people." [...] If the marriage contract fails to contain an exact, specified mahr, the husband must still pay the wife a judicially determined sum.|$|E
2500|$|Maya {{civilization in}} the Central Area reached its full glory {{in the early}} eighth century, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> {{contained}} the seeds of its own destruction, for in the {{century and a half}} that followed, all its magnificent cities had fallen into decline and ultimately suffered abandonment. This was surely one of the most profound social and demographic catastrophes of all human history. Coe lists [...] "environmental collapse" [...] as one of the leading causes of the fall of the great empire, alongside [...] "endemic warfare", [...] "overpopulation", and [...] "drought". [...] "There is mounting evidence for massive deforestation and erosion throughout the Central Area. The Maya apocalypse, for such it was, surely had ecological roots," [...] explains Coe. [...] The plight of the Postclassic Maya is thought to have replicated much of the same situations as existed centuries earlier during the collapse of the Classic period Maya.|$|E
2500|$|Eliot Rabin writes: [...] "For {{the past}} 400 years, readers have been openly {{questioning}} the traditional attribution {{of these five}} books to Moses." [...] For instance, he quotes Thomas Hobbes in his 1651 Leviathan as writing that, when Genesis 12:6 has [...] "and the Canaanite was then in the land", {{it could not have}} been written by Moses. Hobbes may have been the first European to question this attribution in print, arguing that the words can [...] "only sensibly be used by someone who is writing when the Canaanites no longer are in the land ... But the Canaanites were in the land when Moses was alive." [...] Rabin also quotes the 11th century Rabi, Rashi, as saying that Moses could not have written, in Deuteronomy 34:5, [...] "And Moses died there", <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been written by Joshua. However, it is also noted that the second century commentator Rabbi Meir, has it that God dictated those words to Moses, who wrote them down with a tear in his eye.|$|E

2500|$|Ealdgyth {{later became}} the wife and queen consort of her late husband's enemy Harold. The date of the {{marriage}} is unknown, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> taken place at some stage before the Conquest, whether before or after Harold's coronation as king of England (January 1066). It seems that Harold's choice of bride was [...] "aimed not only at securing {{the support of the}} Mercian house for himself in his royal ambitions, but also at weakening the links between that same house and the rulers of north Wales". In any event, Ealdgyth was soon to be widowed for a second time. In October that year, Harold was defeated and died in the Battle of Hastings, which was fought against the invading forces of William, Duke of Normandy, who would subsequently ascend the English throne. At the news of Harold's death, Ealdgyth's brothers went to London to fetch her and immediately sent her to Chester for shelter. It is unknown what happened to her thereafter. Harold had a number of children with his common law wife Edith the Fair, but his marriage to Ealdgyth may not have produced any offspring. It has been suggested that Ealdgyth may have been the mother of Harold's son Harold, but this possibility is not universally accepted.|$|E
