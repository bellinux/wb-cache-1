5|$|The 99 {{surviving}} {{defenders of}} the 2nd Norfolks were eventually ordered by their commander Major Lisle Ryder, the brother of Robert Edward Dudley Ryder, to surrender and they left the cowshed {{that they had been}} defending under a white flag. Due to the boundary between the two British regiments being the road, Ryder's men surrendered not to the company they had <b>been</b> <b>fighting,</b> but rather to SS-Hauptsturmführer Fritz Knöchlein's unit, which had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> the Royal Scots. Graves found near Le Paradis in 2007 suggest that around 20men of the Royal Scots who surrendered to an SS unit may also have been killed in a separate massacre.|$|E

60|$|Then {{the call}} came and {{we went into the}} ring. Bill was desperate. He fought like a tiger, a madman. He was fair crazy. He <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> for more than I <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> for. I <b>was</b> a rising fighter, and I <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> for the money and the recognition.

5|$|Although Arsenal had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> relegation in {{both the}} two {{previous}} seasons, and despite the chairman's restriction on spending, Chapman nevertheless moved to Arsenal soon afterwards, attracted both by the London club's larger crowds and a salary of £2,000, double what he earned at Huddersfield Town. At Arsenal, Chapman immediately made an impact by signing 34-year-old Charlie Buchan, an England international and Sunderland's all-time record goalscorer, whom he made Arsenal captain.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the {{battalion}} received a number of reinforcements from its associated Militia unit, the 3rd Battalion (The Werriwa Regiment). This unit had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> in New Guinea {{as part of the}} 30th Brigade, with whom it had served on the Kokoda Track alongside the 2/3rd as well as the 39th and 49th Battalions, before being returned to Australia, where it had been disbanded. Other reinforcements also arrived from the 16th Battalion, and a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Ian Hutchison took over in April 1943, having temporarily commanded the battalion during the fighting around Eora Creek in the previous campaign.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 1847, Buckner was {{appointed}} quartermaster of the 6th Infantry. Shortly thereafter, {{he participated in}} battles at San Antonio and Churubusco, being slightly wounded in the latter battle. He {{was appointed}} a brevet first lieutenant for gallantry at Churubusco and Contreras, but declined the honor in part because reports of his participation at Contreras were in error—he had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> in San Antonio at the time. Later, he was offered and accepted the same rank solely based on his conduct at Churubusco.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 2–3 May, General Hasso von Manteuffel, {{commander}} of the III Panzer Army along with General Kurt von Tippelskirch, commander of the XXI Army, surrendered to the US Army. Von Saucken's II Army, that had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> north-east of Berlin in the Vistula Delta, surrendered to the Soviets on 9 May. On the morning of 7 May, {{the perimeter of the}} XII Army's bridgehead began to collapse. Wenck crossed the Elbe under small arms fire that afternoon and surrendered to the American Ninth Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} had by now <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> almost continuously {{throughout the}} summer. According to divisional commander Hampel, {{it had been}} exhausted even before Operation Hackfleisch began. The cumulative effect of this exhaustion, the deteriorating situation that the Germans faced on all fronts and rumours probably spread among members by the Partisans and Ustaše, was that the division began to disintegrate in early September 1944.|$|E
5|$|Against this, the Japanese force, {{commanded}} personally by Horii, {{was built}} around a core of four infantry battalions. Three of these were drawn from the 144th Infantry Regiment, which had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> {{since the start of}} the campaign, and one was part of the 41st Infantry Regiment, which had arrived to reinforce the 144th. These troops were supported by an engineer regiment and a mountain artillery battalion, with a total of six artillery pieces: two 75mm guns, two 37mm pieces and two mountain guns, although these were not all available at the start of the battle. According to Dudley McCarthy, author of the Australian official history, the Japanese force in the Isurava area was around 5,000 strong. More conservative estimates, however, place this figure at around 3,000, or 3,500. Of these, only 2,130 were ultimately directly engaged in the battle.|$|E

5|$|By 829, {{when the}} young emperor Theophilos ascended the Byzantine throne, the Byzantines and Arabs had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> {{on and off for}} almost two centuries. At this time, Arab attacks resumed both in the east, where after almost twenty years of peace due to the Abbasid civil war Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) {{launched}} several large-scale raids, and in the west, where the gradual Muslim conquest of Sicily was under way since 827. Theophilos was an ambitious man and also a convinced adherent of Byzantine Iconoclasm, which prohibited the depiction of divine figures and the veneration of icons. He sought to bolster his regime and support his religious policies by military success against the Abbasid Caliphate, the Empire's major antagonist.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{concerns}} about the entry of Japan into {{the war in the}} Pacific, the battalion was brought back to Australia in early 1942. Departing Port Tewfik on 9 February on the MV Vernon, the battalion arrived at Port Adelaide, South Australia, on 9 March and moved to Camp Woodside. In early April they conducted a road and rail move to Casino, New South Wales, where a weeks' leave was granted before moving on to Caboolture, Queensland. During this time the battalion undertook defensive duties securing the northern approach to Brisbane during the Battle of the Coral Sea. From June they began jungle training in preparation for deployment to New Guinea in September where the units of the Militia had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> a delaying campaign against the Japanese along the Kokoda Track.|$|E
5|$|Finally, General Conway {{proposed}} {{what was}} a workable compromise in his opinion: the Fallujah Brigade. Led by former Iraqi Sunni Ba'athists, such as Jasim Mohammed Saleh and Muhammed Latif, and made up largely of insurgents who had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> the Marines, the brigade was supposed to maintain order in the city while allowing the US to withdraw and save face. On 10 May, General Mattis formally turned the city over and withdrew the following day. The First Battle for Fallujah had resulted in 51 US servicemen killed and 476 wounded. Iraqi losses were much higher. The Marines estimated that about 800 Iraqis were killed. Reports differed on how many were civilians: the Marines counted 300, whereas the independent organization Iraq Body Count argued that 600 civilians had been killed.|$|E

5|$|Kelbajar lay {{outside the}} contested enclave {{of the former}} Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, but within Nagorno-Karabakh {{geographic}} region of Azerbaijan, that Armenian and Azerbaijani forces had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> over for five years. The offensive {{was the first time}} Armenian forces from Nagorno-Karabakh had advanced beyond the boundaries of the enclave. Kelbajar rayon, located between Armenia and the western border of former NKAO, was composed of several dozen villages and its provincial capital, also named Kelbajar. According to Russian sources mountain troops from the 128th Regiment (7th Russian Army) stationed in Armenia participated in the seizure of Kelbajar in a blitzkrieg operation. After initial heavy resistance, the Azerbaijani defenses quickly collapsed and the provincial capital fell on April 3, 1993. Kelbajar is currently {{under the control of the}} Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.|$|E
5|$|The Pirates {{had been}} the only National League team to do worse than the Dodgers in 1917, {{finishing}} last. Stengel met with the Pirates owner, Barney Dreyfuss to seek a salary increase, but found Dreyfuss reluctant to deal until Stengel proved himself as a Pirate. On June 3, 1918, Stengel was ejected for arguing with the umpire, and was fined by the league office for taking off his shirt on the field. The U.S. had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> in World War I for a year, and Stengel enlisted in the Navy. His wartime service was playing for and managing the Brooklyn Navy Yard's baseball team, driving in the only run to beat Army, 1–0, before 5,000 spectators at the Polo Grounds. He also occasionally helped paint a ship—he later stated he had guarded the Gowanus Canal, and not a single submarine got into it.|$|E
5|$|Though Air Group 18 pilots logged {{as many as}} {{ten hours}} of flying on the 26th, and to this point had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> {{continuously}} for almost two months, they received no respite. The men were sent out on strikes against Clark Field on October 29. On Strike 2A, some divisions of VF-18 served as high cover while the remainder operated as fighter-bombers {{in tandem with the}} bomber squadrons. As the Hellcats descended to release height, they were intercepted by 15–20 enemy fighters who had been hiding in the overcast to the east of the field. More enemy reinforcements arrived soon after, bringing the total number of Japanese planes to as high as 50. Despite the swarm of enemy airplanes, and moderate anti-aircraft fire, Strike 2A accounted for 12 kills and reported only two pilots lost.|$|E

5|$|When William Rufus became king of England {{after his}} father's death, Malcolm did not {{intervene}} in the rebellions by supporters of Robert Curthose which followed. In 1091, William Rufus confiscated Edgar Ætheling's lands in England, and Edgar fled north to Scotland. In May, Malcolm marched south, not to raid and take slaves and plunder, but to besiege Newcastle, built by Robert Curthose in 1080. This {{appears to have been}} an attempt to advance the frontier south from the River Tweed to the River Tees. The threat was enough to bring the English king back from Normandy, where he had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> Robert Curthose. In September, learning of William Rufus's approaching army, Malcolm withdrew north and the English followed. Unlike in 1072, Malcolm was prepared to fight, but a peace was arranged by Edgar Ætheling and Robert Curthose whereby Malcolm again acknowledged the overlordship of the English king.|$|E
5|$|Although the Achaean League had <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> Macedonia for decades, Aratus sent an embassy to Antigonus III in 226 BC {{seeking an}} {{unexpected}} alliance {{now that the}} reformist king Cleomenes III of Sparta was threatening the rest of Greece in the Cleomenean War (229–222 BC). In exchange for military aid, Antigonus III demanded the return of Corinth to Macedonian control, which Aratus finally agreed to in 225 BC. Antigonus III's first move against Sparta was to capture Arcadia {{in the spring of}} 224 BC. After reforming a Hellenic league in the same vein as Philip II's League of Corinth and hiring Illyrian mercenaries for additional support, Antigonus III managed to defeat Sparta at the Battle of Sellasia in 222 BC. For the first time in Sparta's history, their city was then occupied by a foreign power, restoring Macedonia's position as the leading power in Greece. Antigonus died a year later, perhaps from tuberculosis, leaving behind a strong Hellenistic kingdom for his successor Philip V.|$|E
5|$|First Strike {{takes place}} in the 26th century, where humanity, under the {{governance}} of the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), has <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> a losing war against a religious collective of alien races known as the Covenant. Humanity's best defense against the Covenant is the SPARTAN Project, super-soldiers in powered armor, but these elite troops are too few to turn the tide of war in the UNSC's favor. Following a Covenant attack on Reach, a planet within UNSC jurisdiction, the Pillar of Autumn flees randomly coming across an ancient installation built by the mysterious Forerunner. The Covenant call this relic Halo, and believe it is a weapon and means of transcendence. UNSC discover that Halo is in fact a method of containing a parasite known as the Flood, by destroying all sentient life to prevent the Flood from spreading beyond Halo. The SPARTAN Master Chief and his artificial intelligence companion, Cortana, detonate the Pillar of Autumns engines, destroying Halo. Escaping the destruction via a fighter, the Chief and Cortana believe themselves the only survivors of the catastrophe.|$|E
