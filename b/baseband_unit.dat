In this architecture the radio function unit, {{also known as the}} remote radio head (RRH), is separated from the digital function unit, or <b>baseband</b> <b>unit</b> (BBU) by fiber. Digital baseband signals are carried over fiber, using Open Base Station Architecture Initiative (the OBSAI) or Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) standard. The RRH can be installed on the top of tower close to the antenna, reducing the loss compared to the traditional base station where the RF signal has to travel through a long cable from the base station cabinet to the antenna {{at the top of the}} tower. The fiber link between RRH and BBU also allows more flexibility in network planning and deployment as they can be placed a few hundreds meters or a few kilometres away. Most modern base stations now use this decoupled architecture.|$|E

30|$|Small {{cell systems}} are a {{cost-effective}} solution {{to provide adequate}} coverage inside buildings. Nonetheless, the addition of any indoor site requires evaluating the trade-off between the coverage and capacity gain provided by the new site and its monetary cost. In this paper, a new automatic indoor site selection algorithm based on clustering techniques is presented. The algorithm calculates the number of antennas, radio heads, and baseband units needed for the area under study. Then, a clustering algorithm groups several radio heads of different buildings in a single pooled <b>baseband</b> <b>unit,</b> reducing deployment costs. The proposed clustering algorithm {{is based on a}} local refinement algorithm, whose starting point considers a new <b>baseband</b> <b>unit</b> for every new site, and then, possible reallocation to existing units is checked. To assess the method, the proposed indoor site selection algorithm is included in a network planning tool. The algorithm is tested in a real heterogeneous network scenario, taking into account vendor specifications and operator constraints. Results show that the use of the proposed clustering algorithm can reduce the total network cost by up to 58 % in a real scenario.|$|E

30|$|The C-RAN {{is a novel}} {{mobile network}} architecture, which has a {{potential}} to optimize cost and energy consumption {{in the field of}} mobile networks. In C-RAN systems, there are multiple cloud providers (CPs), which can generate more revenue from the sharing of available resources. CPs have their system resources, such as a CPU core, memory, storage, and network bandwidth. To ensure the optimal usage of cloud resources, baseband processing is centralized in a virtualized <b>baseband</b> <b>units</b> pool (VBP). The VBP can be shared by different CPs and multiple BSs. Therefore, the VBP is in a unique position as a cloud brokering between the BSs and the CPs for cloud services while increasing resource efficiency and system throughput [11].|$|R
30|$|C-RAN {{has come}} to the key {{architecture}} concept for future 5 G networks and beyond. In C-RAN systems, virtualized <b>baseband</b> <b>units</b> pool (VBP) arbitrates multiple cloud providers (CPs) and collects available resources. To ensure the optimal usage of cloud resource, the VBP adaptively distributes this resource to multiple base stations (BSs). In wireless networks, each BS covers a small area and communicates with the mobile users (MUs) through wireless links. Therefore, BSs must provide the managed connectivity and offer flexibility in real-time demands. To improve C-RAN system efficiency, CPs offer their available resources to BSs through the VBP, and BSs provide services to MUs based on their obtained resources. Without loss of generality, the VBP can be assumed as a resource broker between BSs and CPs for cloud services [17].|$|R
