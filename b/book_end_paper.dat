5000|$|Often {{credited}} with defining the modern artists book, Dieter Roth (1930-98) produced {{a series of}} works which systematically deconstructed {{the form of the}} book throughout the fifties and sixties. These disrupted the codexs authority by creating books with holes in (e.g. Picture Book, 1957), allowing the viewer to see more than one page at the same time. Roth was also the first artist to re-use found books-comic <b>books,</b> printers <b>end</b> <b>papers</b> and newspapers (such as Daily Mirror, 1961, and AC, 1964). [...] Although originally produced in Iceland in extremely small editions, Roths books would be produced in increasingly large runs, through numerous publishers in Europe and North America, and would ultimately be reprinted together by the German publisher Hansjörg Mayer in the 1970s, making them more widely available in the last half-century than the work of any other comparable artist.|$|R
40|$|This {{book is not}} {{available}} through ChesterRep. This book explores {{the way in which}} language is used in fiction, poetry and science. It examines the role of metaphor in structuring our thought, and questions any simplistic notion of creativity. There is an enquiry into the significance of myth for the modern writer. Why do our earliest narratives return to haunt us at the end of history? The final essays ask what it means to attempt scientific descriptions of reality in words. Can language here ever be anything more than a clumsy approximation of mathematics? The <b>book</b> <b>ends</b> with a <b>paper</b> written jontly by the particle physicist Goronwy Tudor Jones and Alan Wall, exploring the meaning of complementarity in modern physics, by describing in detail the double-slit experiment...|$|R
40|$|Ouvrage (éditeur). The book {{comprises}} three {{closely related}} parts: {{the first is}} devoted mainly to curve and surface modeling, and contains one general survey on theoretical and practical applications of algebraic methods and three specialized surveys on surface blending, parametrization, and implicitization, followed by four research papers. The second part is concentrated on geometric reasoning, with one tutorial survey on Clifford algebra approaches, another on automated deduction in real geometry, and one research article. The last part is highlighted by a chapter that outlines a theory of real approximation, based on a generalization of the central idea of exact geometric computation. The <b>book</b> <b>ends</b> with one <b>paper</b> on A-resultant quotients and another on face recognition, which show how computer algebra and artificial intelligence meet geometry {{in the era of}} computation...|$|R
5000|$|Hilder was {{commissioned}} by Oxford University Press to illustrate <b>books.</b> His decorative <b>end</b> <b>papers</b> and black and white drawings of [...] "Treasure Island" [...] in 1929 won him The Times illustrators award. In the 1930s he illustrated several books. In 1929 Hilder {{was commissioned}} by Shell Mex Ltd to illustrate [...] "Then and Now", a travel guide which started a long relationship with the company with posters sponsored by them. In 1953 when asked by the publisher George Rainbird to provide background landscapes {{to a series of}} wildflowers by another artist, Hilder showed him pictures of flowers by his wife Edith. Rainbird then commissioned them both to create the Shell [...] "Flowers of the Countryside" [...] series. Demand was so great that Shell set up an office to deal with correspondence and 13 million plates were published.|$|R
