40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} {{the changes in the}} usage of flat-rate expenditure for taxpayers (individuals with income according to ยง 7 of the law on income tax) of the five selected counties with a special focus on the transition of the 2008 / 2009. Theoretical part devoted to the theoretical aspects of the flat-rate expenditure, shows {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} it, compares it with the concept of a flat tax and introduces the classification NACE. The practical part includes a progressive analysis of the collected data. At first, the author is focused on taxpayers with incomes from agriculture, forestry and water management. Moreover, craft and non-craft trade (free, <b>bound,</b> <b>concessions)</b> and the last group consists of other business, together with other self-employed activities. Gradually, the changes in the usage of flat-rate expenditure or numerical distribution of taxpayers in counties and differences among particular counties are described with the necessary details. The summarized data are clearly arranged in tables. Unequivocal reaction has appeared at most of the activities, which does not have to be only the result of increased rates but also the combination of other factors...|$|R
25|$|The {{agreement}} became obsolete when Ryti resigned on July 31, 1944, and was succeeded {{as president}} by Mannerheim, {{who did not}} consider himself or Finland <b>bound</b> by Ryti's <b>concession.</b> Within six weeks, Finland had concluded an armistice with the Soviet Union. In accordance with the armistice conditions, the Lapland War was commenced to evacuate the Wehrmacht from Northern Finland by force.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the force}} was mostly {{occupied}} in the routine business of crime prevention, detection and traffic control, {{it was also}} seen as the Settlement's first line of defense against Chinese nationalist activity. After the failure of the 1913 Second Revolution against the autocratic presidency of Yuan Shikai, the settlement was increasingly troubled by armed crime. In the build-up to, and aftermath of, the 1926-27 Nationalist Revolution, the force also struggled to contain a wave of armed robberies and politically motivated kidnappings. Throughout the 1930s it faced challenges from the Nationalist Government and the police force of the (Nationalist Chinese) City Government of Shanghai, particularly over rights to operate outside the historical <b>bounds</b> of the <b>Concession</b> and in cases of extraterritoriality.|$|R
40|$|In July 1971, the Chilean {{government}} nationalized {{the copper}} industry without compensating U. S. -based corporations that were, until then, co-owners of the mines. After nationalization, the coercive measures and economic strangulation the United States government was already applying against the Salvador Allende government became more acute, leading the Chilean government {{to seek a}} negotiated arrangement that would bring economic relief from the U. S. -imposed blockade. Chile offered to negotiate compensations, linked to the solution of other bilateral issues, in circumstances {{that it had no}} intention of making such <b>concessions,</b> <b>bound</b> by domestic politics and constitutional restrictions. There were four rounds of confidential bilateral conversations in 1972 - 1973 that ended in a total impasse. Both sides became entrapped by their own arguments, based on a fierce defense of principles, divergent interpretations of international law and disagreements on the negotiation agenda...|$|R
40|$|A Rapid Ecological Assessment (REA) was {{undertaken}} in two logging <b>concessions</b> <b>bounding</b> the Kerinci Seblat National Park in Central Sumatra. The REA was implemented by WWF Indonesia {{and funded by}} the World Bank. CIFOR together with LIPI advised on survey method {{as part of a}} wider study involving biodiversity assessment in the Jambi Province. An international team investigated biodiversity pattern in vascular plant species and plant functional groups, insects (mainly butterflies, moths, dung beetles and carabids), herpetofauna (amphibians and reptiles), bats, rodents, large mammals and birds. Unusually restrictive logistics reduced the number of sites to approximately half that needed for a statistical analysis. Results indicate that while plant species and functional richness vary directly with elevation, fauna show a reverse trend. The paper comments on ways of improving logging practices to conserve biodiversity. New global levels of species and functional richness were recorded for several sites. Any future baseline study will require a wider sample of land cover types...|$|R
