40|$|International audienceTo {{control the}} {{structure}} dimensionality of hybrid materials, a common approach consists of selecting ligands with specific <b>bridging</b> <b>modes.</b> Herein, {{we show that}} the <b>bridging</b> <b>mode</b> for some azole ligands with Co(II) metal ions can be tuned in situ using different synthesis conditions. For example, the dimensionality of 1, 2, 4 -triazole based materials could be controlled according to their (de) protonation. Under hydrothermal conditions, deprotonation commonly occurs and leads to the tripodal moiety that favors a high dimensional crystal structure. To target low-dimensional 1, 2, 4 -triazole based cobalt materials, deprotonation was prevented by carrying out hydrothermal syntheses under strong acidic conditions [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|It is {{sometimes}} stated that operating an amplifier pair in <b>bridge</b> <b>mode</b> can give {{four times the}} power (of one of the pair). This statement makes reference {{to the fact that}} power is proportional to the square of the voltage, implying that if the output voltage is doubled - as it is in <b>bridge</b> <b>mode</b> - then the power available increases by a factor of four. This would be true if the amplifier in bridged mode were used to drive loudspeakers of the same impedance used in stereo mode. However, in this case, the current through the loudspeaker and the amplifier would also double, which could exceed the amplifier ratings and lead to overheating and finally destruction of the amplifier. In fact, the minimum impedance of the loudspeaker in bridged mode should be double the minimum impedance rated for stereo mode. Consequently, operating a pair of existing amplifier channels in <b>bridge</b> <b>mode</b> doubles available power output to the load.|$|E

50|$|Some two channel amplifiers, or stereo amplifiers, {{have the}} built in {{facility}} {{to operate in}} <b>bridge</b> <b>mode</b> by operating a switch and observing the input and output connections detailed on the back panel or in the manual. This option is most often found in high power PA equipment or amplifiers designed for car audio applications.

5000|$|Example. Two amplifiers, each rated 100 watts maximum into 4 ohms, in <b>bridge</b> <b>mode</b> {{they will}} {{appear as a}} mono amp rated 200 watts into 8 ohms. This is the most {{commonly}} misunderstood mode of operation and it requires additional circuitry to implement if the pair of amplifiers {{does not have the}} facility built in. The image shows two identical amplifiers A1 and A2 connected in <b>bridge</b> <b>mode.</b> The signals presented to each amplifier of the pair are caused to be in anti-phase. In other words, as the signal in one amplifier is swinging positively, the signal in the other is swinging negatively. If, for example the maximum output voltage swing of each amplifier is between a peak of + and - 10 volts, when the output of one amplifier is at + 10 volts the output of the other will be at -10 volts, which means that the load (a loudspeaker) now sees a 20 volt peak difference between the “hot” (normally red [...] ) output terminals. Driving the load between two signals of opposite electrical polarity makes each amplifier see only half the load's electrical impedance.|$|E
