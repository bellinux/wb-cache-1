5|$|Blackcaps {{and other}} small birds are {{illegally}} trapped and hunted in large numbers in Mediterranean countries, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Malta, Libya, Egypt and Cyprus, where they are considered as a delicacy. Despite hunting and natural hazards, the European population of the blackcap has been rising for several decades as the range extends northwards, for example to Scotland and Denmark. There are occasional nesting records from outside the main range, such as in northern Israel and the Faroes, and wandering birds may appear further afield in Iceland or on the islands of Arctic Russia. In the Baltic, {{the spread of the}} blackcap appears to have been helped by the availability of territories formerly occupied by the declining <b>barred</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>barred</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia nisoria) is {{a typical}} warbler which breeds across {{temperate}} regions {{of central and eastern}} Europe and western and central Asia. This passerine bird is strongly migratory, and winters in tropical eastern Africa.|$|E
50|$|The miombo wren-warbler (Calamonastes undosus), {{also known}} as the miombo <b>barred</b> <b>warbler</b> or pale wren-warbler, is a species of bird in the Cisticolidae family found in {{southern}} Africa. It is sometimes placed in the genus Calamonastes.|$|E
5000|$|... 152 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} in the park. The IBA trigger species recorded are Syrian woodpecker (Dendrocopos syriacus) and <b>Barred</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia nisoria). The faunal species recorded consist of 65 species of mammals. There are seven species of reptiles, which include a tree snake and green lizard.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{medium-sized}} warbler, similar to {{in size to}} the <b>barred</b> <b>warbler,</b> with a slightly longer bill and shorter tail. It is the largest Hippolais warbler, with a heavy bill, rather flat crown, long wings, and heavy legs. The adult has a dusty- or brownish-grey back and wings, and dusty-white underparts.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the genus}} Sylvia {{it is highly}} distinctive; the barred {{underside}} is shared only with the Cyprus warbler, which has black barring and an entirely different overall colour pattern. The <b>barred</b> <b>warbler</b> seems to represent an ancient lineage of Sylvia warblers on its own and {{does not appear to}} have any particularly close relatives in the genus.|$|E

50|$|The <b>barred</b> <b>warbler</b> is a bird of {{open country}} with bushes for nesting, with very similar habitat {{preferences}} to the red-backed shrike. The nest is built in low shrub or brambles, and three to seven eggs are laid. Like most warblers, it is mainly insectivorous, but also takes berries and other soft fruit extensively {{in late summer}} and autumn. Its song is a pleasant chattering like a garden warbler with many clear notes, but is harsher and less melodious, and slightly higher pitched, with some resemblance to the whitethroat's song.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the birds}} of prey which {{frequent}} the area in fairly large numbers between the southernmost point and the Gedser Marina are the rough-legged buzzard, red kite (often flying low), the western marsh harrier and common buzzard. Smaller birds also occur, including the western yellow wagtail, meadow pipit, common chaffinch and brambling. Much less common species have on occasion also been observed in the area, such as little egret, black stork, Steller's eider, short-toed snake eagle, Blyth's reed warbler, great reed warbler, eastern olivaceous warbler, <b>barred</b> <b>warbler,</b> brown warbler and rock bunting.|$|E
50|$|The Rospuda Valley and its {{adjacent}} {{forests are}} inhabited {{by the following}} protected birds: hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia), the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), spotted crake (Porzana porzana), the corn crake (Crex crex), the common crane (Grus grus), the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), lesser spotted eagle (Aquila pomarina), marsh harrier, the European honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus), the Tengmalm's owl (Aegolius funereus), the white stork (Ciconia ciconia), the black woodpecker, the white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos), the red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio), the <b>barred</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia nisoria) and other. The area serves as a haunt for birds nesting nearby, e.g. in Augustów Primeval Forest.|$|E
50|$|The Parco dell'Oglio Sud {{is another}} {{regional}} park that {{lies on the}} boundary of the province with the province of Cremona. It was established in 1988 and has an area of about 12,800 hectares. It is a river park that runs along the stretch of the river Oglio which forms the boundary. It lies {{to the south of}} Lake Iseo and the administrative centre is at Calvatone. Birds present in this park include great egret, grey heron, Montagu's harrier, Eurasian scops owl, bearded reedling, woodcock, <b>barred</b> <b>warbler,</b> crested lark, sedge warbler, moustached warbler, little egret, Eurasian hobby and ferruginous duck.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the island's diverse plant life, a {{relatively}} large number of nesting bird species have been documented. As of March 2006, 92 species were breeding, and of these, approximately 40-50 every year. The <b>barred</b> <b>warbler</b> {{is one of the}} regular species with Jomfruland perhaps being the only location in Norway where this bird breeds. Also thrush nightingale, common rosefinch and red-backed shrike are regular breeding species, whereas more irregular finds are of greenish warbler (1992 [...] - [...] only breeding observation in Norway), stock pigeon, northern shoveler and barnacle goose (the latter two on nearby islands). A vast number of birds breed on islets and skerries around Jomfruland, one of these being the black guillemot.|$|E

50|$|Nanjizel {{is within}} the Porthgwarra to Pordenack Point Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), {{designated}} in 1977 for its granite cliffs and maritime heath. The valley is a constant effort site (CES) for the West Cornwall Ringing Group which monitors the birds in the valley. Breeding birds include common chiffchaff (Phylloscopus collybita), common whitethroat (Sylvia communis), dunnock (Prunella modularis), Eurasian blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla), Eurasian wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) and sedge warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus). Other birds found include brambling (Fringilla montifringilla), cirl bunting (Emberiza cirlus), common grasshopper warbler (Locustella naevia), Eurasian siskin (Spinus spinus) lesser redpoll (Acanthis cabaret) and subalpine warbler (Sylvia cantillans). Rareties ringed {{in the autumn of}} 2014 were aquatic warbler (Acrocephalus paludicola), <b>barred</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia nisoria) and paddyfield warbler (Acrocephalus agricola). A first for Britain occurred on 8 October 2008 with the trapping, and the measuring of biometric data, of an alder flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum). A first for Cornwall occurred on 2 September 2015, when a Blyth's reed warbler (Acrocephalus dumetorum) was ringed. There have been six Isles of Scilly records and one from Devon so it was considered long overdue for Cornwall.|$|E

50|$|They are {{strongly}} built, with stouter legs {{and a slightly}} thicker bill than many other warblers, and {{range in size from}} 11 cm length and 7 g weight (African desert warbler) up to 17 cm length and 36 g weight (<b>barred</b> <b>warbler).</b> The plumage is in varying shades of grey and brown, usually darker above and paler below, with bluish or pinkish tones in several species; several also have orange-brown or rufous fringed wing feathers. The tail is square-ended in most, slightly rounded in a few, and in several species has white sides. Many of the species show some sexual dimorphism, with distinctive male and female plumages, with the males in many having black or bright grey on the heads, replaced by brown, brownish-grey or similar dusky colours in females; {{about a third of the}} species also have a conspicuous red eye ring in males. Species breeding in cool temperate regions {{are strongly}} migratory, while most of those in warmer regions are partially migratory or resident. They are active warblers usually associated with open woodland, scrub, hedges or shrubs. Their diet is largely insectivorous, though several species also eat fruit extensively, mainly small berries such as elder and ivy, particularly from late summer to late winter; one species (blackcap) also frequently takes a wide variety of human-provided foods on birdtables in winter.|$|E
40|$|My {{study was}} aimed to {{describe}} the antipredator behaviour of <b>Barred</b> <b>Warbler</b> against five avian mounted dummies differing {{in the level of}} threat they represent for the Barred Warbler: Eurasian Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), Eurasian Jay (Garrulus glandarius), Black-billed Magpie (Pica pica), Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio), and Domastic Pigeon (Columba livia f. domestica) using the experiments carried {{in the vicinity of the}} nests with fledglings of <b>Barred</b> <b>Warbler.</b> The next goal of my study was to discover the relationship between the <b>Barred</b> <b>Warbler</b> and the Red-backed Shrike nesting together...|$|E

40|$|The {{composition}} {{and quality of}} food provided to nestling birds influence their growth and development and offers key insight into the ecological requirements of birds. One bird spe-cies whose feeding ecology is poorly understood is the <b>Barred</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Sylvia nisoria), which utilizes semi-natural shrubby vegetation in agroecosystems. Because Barred War-bler nestlings vary greatly in body mass we hypothesised that diet and prey properties (size, diversity, taxonomic composition, and chitin content and resulting body hardness and digestibility) would differ as the nestlings aged. We quantified the diet based on faecal anal-ysis, sampling faecal sacs from the nestlings pooled into three age classes: 2 - 3 days old, 4 - 6 d old, and 7 - 9 d old. Nestlings were provided a wide diversity of food and a strong relation-ship existed between food characteristics and nestling age. The youngest nestlings (2 - 3 d old) had the lowest values of each dietary characteristic (diversity, number and total bio-mass of prey, and individual prey weight), that were {{significantly lower than the}} oldest nest-lings (7 - 9 d old). Nestlings aged 4 - 6 d exhibited intermediate dietary characteristics. Differences in dietary composition of the six major food types showed marked difference...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous {{afforestation}} {{is one of}} the biosystemic landscape change processes affecting landscape functioning. The {{process of}} overgrowing is highly dynamic, and the temporal dimension of changes in landscape structure can be of key importance for evaluating habitat suitability. A detailed study was carried out in the area of 19. 52 km 2 within the Pivka municipality, where land use is a mixture of traditional farmland, forests, and extended areas of abandoned former farmland with natural re-growth. In addition, this area is highly important for two bird species: the <b>Barred</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Sylvia nisoria) and the Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio). Both species are sensitive to forest spreading and prefer a mixture of extensive meadows with shrubs and hedgerows as their most suitable habitat. Digital BW orthophotos from the 1975 – 2000 period and colour digital orthophotos from 2009 have been used for on screen digitizing of the EUNIS habitat classes. Indicators of landscape changes were derived from temporal based difference in the landscape structure (different structural indicators based on patch size, shape, distances and patch dynamics). All the details obtained were evaluated based on Earth observation data and GIS supported methods. The most valuable parts of the area for both species are, from a biodiversity point of view, the core forest areas and mixture of meadows with shrubs and hedgerows...|$|E
40|$|We used a nested PCR {{protocol}} {{to examine the}} genetic diversity of cytochrome b (cyt b) lineages from blood parasites of the genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus in birds in Bulgaria. In total, 460 birds of 43 species and 14 families (mostly passerines) were examined {{for the presence of}} infections. Of them, 267 were recognised as infected with haemosporidian parasites. Mixed infections were recorded in 24 individuals (9 %). Besides the 24 individuals with mix infections, 114 (43 %) were positive for Plasmodium spp. and 129 (48 %) for Haemoproteus spp. We identified 52 genetic lineages of haemosporidian parasites: 38 of Haemoproteus and 14 of Plasmodium. Twelve new cyt b lineages of Haemoproteus were recorded; they occurred in the following hosts: grey-faced woodpecker (Picus canus), golden oriole (Oriolus oriolus), jay (Garrulus glandarius), <b>barred</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia nisoria), song thrush (Turdus philomelos), spotted flycatcher (Muscicapa striata), spanish sparrow (Passer hispaniolensis), hawfinch (Coccothraustes coccothraustes), and cirl bunting (Emberiza cirlus). We also detected 22 new host records for previously known lineages. The most common lineage was SGS 1 (Plasmodium relictum), which had a total prevalence of 14 % and occurred in 8 host species belonging to 5 families. Three of the cyt b lineages of genus Haemoproteus (DURB 1, DURB 2 and SYNIS 2) showed more than 5 % divergence from all described morphologically lineages. These lineages probably represent at least 2 different morphospecies which remains to be identified...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{the mean}} date of fi rst captures and median arrival dates of spring {{migration}} for 34 species of birds at Eilat, Israel, revealed that the earlier a species migrates through Eilat, the greater is the inter-annual variation in the total time of its passage. Birds arrive during spring migration in Eilat in four structured and independent waves. Th e annual fl uctuation in the initial arrival dates (initial capture dates) and median dates (median date of all captures), not including recaptures, did {{not depend on the}} length of the mi gratory route. Th is implies that migrants crossing the Sahara desert depart from their winter quarters on diff erent Julian days in diff erent years. We suggest that negative correlations between the median date of the spring migration of early and late migrants depends upon the easterly (Hamsin) wind period. Moreover, we believe that the phenology of all birds during spring migration in Eilat is possibly also determined by external factors such as weather conditions on the African continent or global climatic processes in the Northern hemisphere. Orphean Warblers (Sylvia hortensis) show a strong negative correlation (rs =- 0. 502) of initial capture date with calendar years, whereas other species such as <b>Barred</b> <b>Warbler</b> (S. nisoria; rs =- 0. 391) and Spotted Flycatcher (Muscicapa striata; rs =- 0. 398) display an insignifi cant trend.
