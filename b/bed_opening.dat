40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. 1100 orebody {{is a large}} copper orebody deep {{in the southern part}} of Mount Isa Mines, North-Western Queensland. Host rock is a recrystallised siliceous, dolomitic breccia enveloped by pyritic, dolomitic shale striking 340 deg- 160 deg, dipping 65 deg W. Within this orebody are faults which have a characteristic filling of calcite and gypsum. They are the last stage of shear fracturing in the mine area, possibly being a result of an E-W compression along an axis essentially normal to bedding, though their movement picture is not clear. The faults are as main faults, in a conjugate pair, and as auxiliary faults, whose development is influenced by the rock type, with an average orientation of 116 deg- 296 deg, 86 deg NE and 064 deg- 244 deg, 70 deg NW. Uplift of these rocks, with a relaxation of stress, has resulted in a N-S horizontal extension along <b>bedding,</b> <b>opening</b> of faults with subsequent filling of calcite and gypsum, and extension fracturing with fracture planes normal to bedding.

40|$|Man-made {{structures}} {{have become}} ubiquitous features of coastal landscapes. These artificial habitats are popular recreation sites. Patterns {{and effects of}} recreational activities were investigated from 1999 to 2004 on coastal structures along 40 km of shoreline in the Emilia Romagna region (North Adriatic Sea, Italy). Four studies estimated the magnitude and frequency of exploitation by people, and established how human exploitation varied in space and time. A manipulative experiment involving the removal of mussels, mimicking the impact of human harvesting, was carried out to identify the effects of extensive mussel exploitation. Recreational exploitation was a major recurrent disturbance. Hundreds of people visited defence structures for recreational fishing and to harvest a variety of invertebrates to be used primarily as food. Human exploitation was most intense during {{the spring and summer}} but relatively unpredictable at scales of days and hours. Exploitation was homogeneous among different locations, despite marked differences in the accessibility of the structures. Visitors to the structures were mainly local people. Harvesting of mussels was particularly disruptive for the assemblages, leading to depletion of mussel <b>beds,</b> <b>opening</b> of unoccupied space, patchiness in the assemblages, and favouring the development of macroalgae. The main types of macroalgae were green and filamentous algae, which are a nuisance for beach tourism in the area, and the invasive species Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides. Effective management of human access to artificial habitats is essential, since recreational exploitation influences the distribution and structure of their associated assemblages, ultimately affecting the native characteristics of the areas...|$|R

40|$|A major {{stumbling}} block to progress in understanding basic human interactions, such as {{getting out of}} <b>bed</b> or <b>opening</b> a refrigerator, is lack of good training data.

We use Internet Lifestyle Vlogs as the source of surprisingly large and diverse interaction data. We show that by collecting the data first, we are able to achieve greater scale and far greater diversity in terms of actions and actors.

40|$|A {{geologic}} {{framework is}} required to understand {{the environmental impact of}} proposed mining of lead and zinc on large springs in the karst area of south-central Missouri. Information about lithologies, faults, joints, and karst features (sinkholes, caves, and springs) contributes {{to the development of a}} conceptual model of karst hydrogeology. Conduits and caves along bedding planes and joints provide avenues for ground-water recharge, movement, and discharge. The trend of joints was studied to determine if they controlled the orientation of cave passages and conduits. The data show that cave passages are curvilinear and do no correlate well with measured joint trends. Instead, stratigraphy, bedding-plane dip, and local base level affect conduit and cave development. The majority of caves in south-central Missouri have developed within stromatolitic dolomite horizons beneath sandstone beds. It is thought that the sandstone beds act as confining units allowing artesian conditions and mixing to occur beneath them, thus, enhancing dissolution. Joints and the high primary porosity of the stromatolitic dolomite <b>beds</b> form <b>openings</b> in the bedrock that initiate solution. Where a solution-widened joint intersects a bedding plane, lateral movement of ground water is controlled by the bedding plane...|$|R

Mrs. Sharp looked anxiously in the place where Tina kept her hat and cloak; they were not there, so that she had had at least the presence of mind to put them on.

40|$|In recent years, {{the rate}} at which workers and {{businesses}} exchange jobs has declined in the United States. Between 1998 and 2010, rates of job creation, job destruction, hiring, and separation declined dramatically, and the rate of job-to-job flows fell by about half. Little is known about {{the nature and extent of}} these changes, and even less about their causes and implications. In this paper, we document and attempt to explain the recent decline in employment dynamics. Our empirical work relies on the four leading datasets of quarterly employment dynamics in the United States - the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD), the Business Employment Dynamics (<b>BED),</b> the Job <b>Openings</b> and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), and the Current Population Survey (CPS). We find that changes in the composition of the labor force and of employers explain relatively little of the decline. Exploiting some identities that relate the different measures to each other, we find that job creation and destruction could explain as much of a third of the decline in hires and separations, while job-to-job flows may explain more of the decline. We end our paper with a discussion of different possible explanations and their relative merits...|$|R

The fire was laid, an unexpected consideration from the old housekeeper,--and I lit it, to keep down any disposition to shiver, and when it was burning well, I stood round with my back to it and regarded the room again. I had pulled up a chintz-covered arm-chair and a table, to form a kind of barricade before me, and on this lay my revolver ready to hand. My precise examination had done me good, but I still found the remoter darkness of the place, and its perfect stillness, too stimulating for the imagination. The echoing of the stir and crackling of the fire was no sort of comfort to me. The shadow in the alcove at the end in particular, had that undefinable quality of a presence, that odd suggestion of a lurking, living thing, that comes so easily in silence and solitude. At last, to reassure myself, I walked with a candle into it, and satisfied myself that there was nothing tangible there. I stood that candle upon the floor of the alcove, and left it in that position.|$|R

It is essential to understand the conditions that lead to bed saturation, and to forecast the packing characteristics of saturated beds to assess the effect of excess fine sediment supply {{on a number of}} processes that occur in the stream-sediment boundary. To address this problem, in this study, a new method is introduced to predict the grain-size distribution for the saturated condition, and the resulting porosity decrease, given the characteristics of the bed and the supplied sediments. The new method consists of the numerical aggregation of infilling fines in a finite bed volume, during which the bed properties change to affect further infilling. An existing semi-empirical, particle packing model is implemented to identify these properties. It is shown that these types of models are adequate to describe regimes of natural sediment fabric quantitatively, and are thus useful tools in the analysis of sediment infiltration processes. Unlike previous developments to quantify saturated bed conditions, which assume that the supplied material is uniform and finer than the <b>bed</b> pore <b>openings,</b> the method developed herein considers poorly sorted fines, and can identify size fractions that are able to ingress into the bed due to being smaller than the particles that form the bed structure. Application of the new method to published experimental data showed that the final content of infiltrated fines is strongly sensitive to the initial bed packing density, highlighting the need to measure and understand open-work gravel deposits. In addition, the new method was shown to be suitable for assessing the degree of bed saturation, when it was applied to a published data set of field samples.
