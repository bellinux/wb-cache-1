[...] "I recollect seeing this done once at home. Hand me the bit of whip-cord." [...] With the cord and <b>branch</b> <b>Jack</b> soon formed a bow. Then he cut a piece about three inches long {{off the end of}} a dead branch, which he pointed at the two ends. Round this he passed the cord of the bow, and placed one end against his chest, which was protected from its point by a chip of wood; the other point he placed against the bit of tinder, and then began to saw vigorously with the bow, just as a blacksmith does with his drill while boring a hole in a piece of iron. In a few seconds the tinder began to smoke; {{in less than a minute}} it caught fire; and in less than a quarter of an hour we were drinking our lemonade and eating cocoa-nuts round a fire that would have roasted an entire sheep, while the smoke, flames, and sparks flew up among the broad leaves of the overhanging palm-trees, and cast a warm glow upon our leafy bower.|$|E
50|$|In mid-April 1805, <b>Branch</b> <b>Jack</b> led attacks upon {{isolated}} Hawkesbury River farms killing three settlers. General {{orders were}} issued sending NSW Corps soldiers to the frontier farms and banning Aboriginal {{people from the}} farms. The government farm at Seven Hills was attacked and two of Macarthurs's stockmen at Cobbity were killed. An attack on the William and Mary at Pitt Water was thwarted and two salt boilers thought killed were escorted back to Sydney by Aboriginal people. In early May 1805, the Bidjigal people around Prospect sued for peace. The most intense fighting occurred in mid May with more attacks on boats at Pitt Water, attacks on farms at Seven Hills and Concord, and attacks on travellers at Homebush. Andrew Thompson led an attack on Aboriginal camps near the junction of the Nepean, Grose and Hawkesbury Rivers. Tedbury, son of Pemulwuy, was captured near Pennant Hills. In June, the fighting continued on the Hawkesbury and Georges Rivers and South Creek. The fighting appears to have ceased with the apprehension of the Aboriginal warrior, Musquito, in late June. Five white men were killed in 1805. The Governor's report of six Aboriginal casualties in the fighting should be treated with caution.|$|E

50|$|The Federal Union under Norm Gallagher faced many protests {{initially}} {{when the}} Federal union intervened {{in the affairs}} of the N.S.W. branch of the union in the mid-seventies. Many of the democratic measures installed by the N.S.W. <b>Branch</b> leadership by <b>Jack</b> Mundey, Bob Pringle and Joe Owens and others were scrapped and many of the democratically imposed Green Bans were lifted. Officials of the N.S.W. Branch eventually urged members to join the imposed branch, but were themselves blacklisted from the industry by Federal Union officials. The Federal takeover of the N.S.W. Branch was instrumental in calling off many of the imposed Green Bans and the cancellation of the union's commitment to fighting for permanence in the building industry.|$|R

60|$|For {{some time}} Farmer Brown's boy worked busily {{at the place}} where the <b>branch</b> that Happy <b>Jack</b> knew so well started out from the trunk of the tree towards the window of Farmer Brown's boy's room. When he had fixed things to suit him, he went down the ladder and carried it away with him. In the crotch of the tree he had left the queer thing that he had brought under his arm. In spite of his fears, Happy Jack was curious. Little by little he crept nearer. What he saw was a box with a round hole, just about big enough for him to go through, in one end, and in front of it a little shelf. On the shelf were some of the nuts that he liked best.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{entering}} Cantonment, CR 95A {{merges with}} US 29 {{just south of}} the grounds of a large International Paper factory across the street from that intersection, where the road becomes a four-lane undivided highway. The railroad line that serves that plant, connecting the former Frisco line to the old L&N line encounters the road in a grade crossing {{just south of the}} intersection with Muscogee Road (Pensacola CR 184) and Beck's Lake Road, where CR 184 secretly joins the route. Shortly after this intersection, CR 95A separates from US 29 once again just after the divider is revived. After the intersection with Neal Road, US 29 gains the supplemental name [...] "Don Sutton Highway" [...] and then runs under a power line right-of-way. From there, the route continues northwest as it passes by the Central Commerce Park just before entering Molino curving back towards the north. Escambia CR 184 branches off to the east onto West Quintette Road, then US crosses over the <b>Jack's</b> <b>Branch</b> River, and later flies through the intersection with Escambia CR 196. North of there the road descends slightly over a culvert over a tributary of Cowdevil Creek, but then elevates through a wooded area which ends at some farmland {{at the top of this}} ascension. The road passes by an Escambia County Sheriff's station on the northeast corner of Omega Avenue, and later dips again as it approaches the culvert over the Dry Creek just south of a blinker-light intersection with Escambia CR 182. Just north of here, the road inherits the name [...] "Century Boulevard," [...] and runs parallel to the same power line right-of-way it crossed under at Neal Road in Cantonment. It passes a power substation across the street from local businesses, but more forestland can be found on the east side while more farmland can be found on the west side, with the brief exception of church across from the intersection with Bet Raines Road. From there, the forest on the east side evolves into farmland until it approaches Florida State Road 97 which spans southeast to CR 95A and northwest to Atmore, Alabama. The power lines move to the northeast and less than 1/2 mile from there, US 29 encounters the northern terminus of CR 95A right after a second crossing of the <b>Jack's</b> <b>Branch</b> River.|$|R
5000|$|Whataburger is {{sometimes}} {{confused with the}} What-A-Burger (note hyphens) chain of family-operated restaurants in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The first What-A-Burger store opened in 1950 by entrepreneur <b>Jack</b> <b>Branch</b> near Newport News, Virginia at Newport News Circle (intersection of Jefferson Avenue and U.S. Route 258) in the former Warwick County. Branch's first location predated the first Texas Whataburger restaurant slightly; the move took place after a modernization project involving the traffic circle. What-A-Burger and Whataburger were unaware of each other's existence several states apart until around 1970, when there was some correspondence. However, no legal actions took place until 2002-2003, when the two companies sued {{each other over the}} alleged trademark infringement. The Court of Appeals, in 2004, eventually decided the Texas Whataburger had a legitimate trademark; but the Virginia chain did not harm the much larger Texas-based chain in any way, nor did they cause any reasonable public confusion. The court said [...] "There is no evidence — nor can we imagine any — that consumers are currently likely to be confused about whether the burgers served by Virginia W-A-B come from Texas or Virginia." ...|$|R
