40|$|Adams-Stokes {{attacks were}} {{observed}} in an elderly diabetic in whom clinical and anatomical manifestations of arteriosclerosis were minimal. A relation, however, between the under-lying cardiac disturbance and the metabolic changes of diabetes was evident. Some rather unusual electrocardiograms were obtained during Adams-Stokes attacks. In view of these uncommon features, and since we have failed to find reports of similar cases, it seemed worth while reporting it in detail. A dental surgeon, 58 years old, was admitted to hospital with mild collapse and heart failure on December 24, 1942. His mother suffered from hypertension and one brother from diabetes. He was born in Palestine, and had had malaria in his youth. He had never been seriously ill until 1929, when he became diabetic. Thereafter he was under the regular care of his physician, Dr. Korkidi, to whom we wish to express our gratitude for his kind co-operation and for the material provided by him. His diabetes proved to be rather severe, but was fairly well controlled by almost regular insulin injections during the course ofmany years. Except for a few pyodermic complications (a furuncle of the lip and a phlegmone of the hand in 1936) {{he had never been}} obliged to stop work in his dental practice.

40|$|Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) usually {{occurs with}} rapid {{correction}} of severe chronic hyponatremia. Despite the pronounced fluctuations in serum osmolality, CPM is rarely seen in diabetics. This {{is a case}} report of CPM associated with hyperglycemia. A 45 -year-old non-smoking and non-alcoholic African American male with past medical history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, stage V chronic kidney disease and hypothyroidism presented with a two-week history of intermittent episodes of gait imbalance, slurred speech and inappropriate laughter. Physical examination including complete neurological assessment and fundoscopic examination were unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation was significant for serum sodium: 140 mmol/L, potassium: 3. 9 mmol/L, serum glucose: 178 mg/dL and serum osmolality: 317 mosmol/kg. His ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>sugars</b> <b>fluctuated</b> between 100 and 600 mg/dL in the six weeks prior to presentation, without any significant or rapid changes in his corrected serum sodium or other electrolyte levels. MRI brain demonstrated a symmetric lesion in the central pons with increased signal intensity on T 2 - and diffusion-weighted images. After neurological consultation and MRI confirmation, the patient was diagnosed with CPM secondary to hyperosmolar hyperglycemia. Eight-week follow-up with neurology was notable for near-complete resolution of symptoms. This case report {{highlights the importance of}} adequate blood glucose control in diabetics.

40|$|Abstract Athletes {{diagnosed}} with diabetes {{may have difficulty}} with their <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> levels <b>fluctuating</b> during intense exercise. Considerations for athletes with insulin concerns may range anywhere from exercise rehabilitation {{to the use of}} an automatic insulin pump. The automatic insulin pump is a small battery-operated device {{about the size of a}} pager. The pump continuously delivers small doses of insulin to the body. It can be conveniently clipped to a belt, waistband, or carried in a pocket. Many athletes have used this machine to assist with insulin control. Medical people believe that those who use the insulin pump will experience better insulin control.   Insulin pumps should be padded during rough physical activity, such as football, because subjects have a needle inserted in the side of their abdomen. The insulin pump regulates <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> before and after practice to ensure insulin levels are appropriate. Checking insulin levels, while participating in physical activities, is a requirement to prevent further injuries.

40|$|Abstract. There is {{a current}} debate {{concerning}} whether people’s physiological or behavioral potential alters {{their perception of}} slanted surfaces. One way to directly test this is to physiologically change people’s potential by lowering their <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> and comparing their estimates of slant to those with normal <b>blood</b> <b>sugar.</b> In the first investigation of this (Schnall, Zadra, & Proffitt, 2010), it was shown that people with low <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> gave higher estimates of slanted surfaces than people with normal <b>blood</b> <b>sugar.</b> The {{question that arises is}} whether these higher estimates are due to lower <b>blood</b> <b>sugar,</b> per se, or experimental demand created by other aspects of the experiment.

5000|$|Patients with {{fluctuating}} insulin requirements {{may benefit}} from a closed-loop predictive modeling approach. As an extension on [...] "carb counting", in this closed-loop predictive modeling approach, the four daily insulin dosages needed to reach the target <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> levels for the “normal” daily carbohydrate consumption and amount of physical activity, are continuously adjusted based on the pre-meal and pre-night <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> level readings. Each new <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> reading provides the feedback to fine-tune and track the body’s insulin requirements. Within this strategy the key patient specific factors, which have to be determined experimentally, are the <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> correction factor and the carbohydrate ratio. The <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> correction factor sets both the “proportional gain” and “integral gain” factors for the four feedback loops. When taken too low, deviations from the target <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> level are not corrected for effectively, when taken too high, the <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> regulation will become unstable.
