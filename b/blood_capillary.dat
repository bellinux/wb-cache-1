The CO2 laser is used in oral and dental surgery for virtually all soft-tissue procedures, such as gingivecomies, vestibuloplasties, frenectomies and operculectomies. The CO2 laser's 10,600 nm wavelength is also safe around implants as it is reflected by titanium, and thus has been gaining popularity in the field of periodontology.

50|$|Another {{attraction}} of Transfersome {{technology is the}} carrier's ability to target peripheral, subcutaneous tissue.

The Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ketoprofen in a Transfersome formulation gained marketing approval by the Swiss regulatory agency (SwissMedic) in 2007; the product {{is expected to be}} marketed under the trademark Diractin.

50|$|Glucose is a six-carbon sugar that {{provides}} energy needed by cells. Since glucose {{is a large}} molecule, {{it is difficult to}} be transported across the membrane through passive diffusion. Hence, it diffuses across membranes through facilitated diffusion, down the concentration gradient. The carrier protein at the membrane binds to the glucose and alters its shape such that it can easily to be transported {{from one side of the}} membrane to the other. Movement of glucose into the cell could be rapid or slow depending on the number of membrane-spanning protein. It is transported against the concentration gradient by a dependent glucose symporter which provides a driving force to other glucose molecules in the cells. Facilitated diffusion helps in the release of accumulated glucose into the extracellular space adjacent to the <b>blood</b> <b>capillary.</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{application}} of orthodontic forces subjects <b>blood</b> <b>capillaries</b> to considerable pressure, resulting in hypoxia on the pressure side. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), expressed in osteoblasts represents an important mitogen that induces angiogenesis. Osteoblasts and <b>blood</b> <b>capillaries</b> {{play an important}} role in bone formation. Robusta coffee contains chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid both of which produce antioxidant effects capable of reducing oxidative stress in osteoblasts. Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of Robusta coffee extract on the number of osteoblasts and <b>blood</b> <b>capillaries</b> in orthodontic tooth movement. Methods: This research constituted a laboratory-based experimental study involving the use of sixteen male rodents divided into two groups, namely; control group (C) consisting of eight mice given orthodontic mechanical force (OMF) and a treatment group (T) containing eight mice administered OMF and dried Robusta coffee extract at a dose of 20 mg/ 100 g BW. The OMF was performed by installing a ligature wire on the maxillary right first molar and both maxillary incisors. In the following stage, the maxillary right first molar was moved to the mesial using Tension Gauze with a Nickel Titanium Orthodontic closed coil spring. Observation was subsequently undertaken on the 15 th day by extracting the maxillary right first and second molar with their periodontal tissues. Thereafter, histological examination was performed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining technique to measure the number of osteoblasts and <b>blood</b> <b>capillaries</b> on the mesial and distal periodontal ligaments of the maxillary right first molar. Results: The administration of Robusta coffee extract increases the number of <b>blood</b> <b>capillaries</b> and osteoblasts on both the pressure and tension sides were found to be significantly higher in the T group compared to the C group (p< 0, 05). Conclusion: Robusta coffee extract increase the number of osteoblasts and <b>blood</b> <b>capillaries,</b> thereby playing a role in improving the alveolar bone remodeling process in orthodontic tooth movement...|$|R

50|$|After fracture, {{the first}} change seen by light and {{electron}} microscopy {{is the presence}} of blood cells within the tissues adjacent to the injury site. Soon after fracture, the blood vessels constrict, stopping any further bleeding. Within a few hours after fracture, the extravascular blood cells form a blood clot, known as a hematoma. These cells release cytokines and increase <b>blood</b> <b>capillary</b> permeability. All of the cells within the blood clot degenerate and die. Some of the cells outside of the blood clot, but adjacent to the injury site, also degenerate and die. Within this same area, the fibroblasts survive and replicate. They form a loose aggregate of cells, interspersed with small blood vessels, known as granulation tissue. This tissue reduces strain across the fracture site. Osteoclasts move in to reabsorb dead bone ends and other necrotic tissue are removed.|$|E
50|$|Microdialysis is a minimally-invasive {{sampling}} technique {{that is used}} for continuous measurement of free, unbound analyte concentrations in the extracellular fluid of virtually any tissue. Analytes may include endogenous molecules (e.g. neurotransmitter, hormones, glucose, etc.) to assess their biochemical functions in the body, or exogenous compounds (e.g. pharmaceuticals) to determine their distribution within the body. The microdialysis technique requires the insertion of a small microdialysis catheter (also referred to as microdialysis probe) into the tissue of interest. The microdialysis probe is designed to mimic a <b>blood</b> <b>capillary</b> and consists of a shaft with a semipermeable hollow fiber membrane at its tip, which is connected to inlet and outlet tubing. The probe is continuously perfused with an aqueous solution (perfusate) that closely resembles the (ionic) composition of the surrounding tissue fluid at a low flow rate of approximately 0.1-5μL/min. Once inserted into the tissue or (body)fluid of interest, small solutes can cross the semipermeable membrane by passive diffusion. The direction of the analyte flow {{is determined by the}} respective concentration gradient and allows the usage of microdialysis probes as sampling as well as delivery tools. The solution leaving the probe (dialysate) is collected at certain time intervals for analysis.|$|E
50|$|During weaning, {{decreased}} prolactin, missing mechanical stimulation (baby suckling), {{and changes}} in osmotic balance caused by milk stasis and leaking of tight junctions cause cessation of milk production. It is the (passive) process of a child or animal ceasing {{to be dependent on}} the mother for nourishment. In some species there is complete or partial involution of alveolar structures after weaning, in humans there is only partial involution and the level of involution in humans appears to be highly individual. The glands in the breast do secrete fluid also in nonlactating women. In some other species (such as cows), all alveoli and secretory duct structures collapse by programmed cell death (apoptosis) and autophagy for lack of growth promoting factors either from the ECM or circulating hormones. At the same time, apoptosis of <b>blood</b> <b>capillary</b> endothelial cells speeds up the regression of lactation ductal beds. Shrinkage of the mammary duct tree and ECM remodeling by various proteinase is under the control of somatostatin and other growth inhibiting hormones and local factors. This major structural change leads loose fat tissue to fill the empty space afterward. But a functional lactiferous duct tree can be formed again when a female is pregnant again.|$|E

40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) -C is {{necessary}} for lymphangiogenesis, and excess VEGF-C {{has been shown to}} be ameliorative for edema produced by lymphatic obstruction in experimental models. However, it has recently been shown that edema can resolve in the mouse tail even in the complete absence of capillary lymphangiogenesis when distal lymph fluid crosses the regenerating wound site interstitially. This finding has raised questions about the action of VEGF-C/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) signaling during the resolution of experimental edema. Here, the roles of VEGFR- 2 and VEGFR- 3 signaling in edema resolution were explored. It was found that edema resolved following neutralization of either VEGFR- 2 or VEGFR- 3 in the mouse tail skin, which inhibited lymphangiogenesis. Neutralization of either VEGFR- 2 or VEGFR- 3 reduced angiogenesis at the site of obstruction at day 10 (9. 2 ± 1. 2 % and 11. 5 ± 1. 0 % <b>blood</b> <b>capillary</b> coverage, respectively) relative to controls (14. 3 ± 1. 5 % <b>blood</b> <b>capillary</b> coverage). Combined VEGFR- 2 /- 3 neutralization more strongly inhibited angiogenesis (6. 9 ± 1. 5 % <b>blood</b> <b>capillary</b> coverage), leading to a reduced wound repair of the lymphatic obstruction and extended edema in the tail skin. In contrast, improved tissue repair of the obstruction site increased edema resolution. Macrophages in the swollen tissue were excluded as contributing factors in the VEGFR-dependent extended edema. These results support a role for VEGFR- 2 /- 3 -combined signaling in the resolution of experimental edema that is lymphangiogenesis independent...|$|E

50|$|Moist {{heat therapy}} has been {{believed}} {{to be more effective}} at warming tissues than dry heat, because water transfers heat more quickly than air.

40|$|Abstract Background Much of {{our current}} {{understanding}} of microvascular permeability {{is based on the}} findings of classic experimental studies of <b>blood</b> <b>capillary</b> permeability to various-sized lipid-insoluble endogenous and non-endogenous macromolecules. According to the classic small pore theory of microvascular permeability, which was formulated {{on the basis of the}} findings of studies on the transcapillary flow rates of various-sized systemically or regionally perfused endogenous macromolecules, transcapillary exchange across the capillary wall takes place through a single population of small pores that are approximately 6 nm in diameter; whereas, according to the dual pore theory of microvascular permeability, which was formulated on the basis of the findings of studies on the accumulation of various-sized systemically or regionally perfused non-endogenous macromolecules in the locoregional tissue lymphatic drainages, transcapillary exchange across the capillary wall also takes place through a separate population of large pores, or capillary leaks, that are between 24 and 60 nm in diameter. The classification of <b>blood</b> <b>capillary</b> types on the basis of differences in the physiologic upper limits of pore size to transvascular flow highlights the differences in the transcapillary exchange routes for the transvascular transport of endogenous and non-endogenous macromolecules across the capillary walls of different <b>blood</b> <b>capillary</b> types. Methods The findings and published data of studies on capillary wall ultrastructure and capillary microvascular permeability to lipid-insoluble endogenous and non-endogenous molecules from the 1950 s to date were reviewed. In this study, the <b>blood</b> <b>capillary</b> types in different tissues and organs were classified on the basis of the physiologic upper limits of pore size to the transvascular flow of lipid-insoluble molecules. Blood capillaries were classified as non-sinusoidal or sinusoidal on the basis of capillary wall basement membrane layer continuity or lack thereof. Non-sinusoidal blood capillaries were further sub-classified as non-fenestrated or fenestrated based on the absence or presence of endothelial cells with fenestrations. The sinusoidal blood capillaries of the liver, myeloid (red) bone marrow, and spleen were sub-classified as reticuloendothelial or non-reticuloendothelial based on the phago-endocytic capacity of the endothelial cells. Results The physiologic upper limit of pore size for transvascular flow across capillary walls of non-sinusoidal non-fenestrated blood capillaries is less than 1 nm for those with interendothelial cell clefts lined with zona occludens junctions (i. e. brain and spinal cord), and approximately 5 nm for those with clefts lined with macula occludens junctions (i. e. skeletal muscle). The physiologic upper limit of pore size for transvascular flow across the capillary walls of non-sinusoidal fenestrated blood capillaries with diaphragmed fenestrae ranges between 6 and 12 nm (i. e. exocrine and endocrine glands); whereas, the physiologic upper limit of pore size for transvascular flow across the capillary walls of non-sinusoidal fenestrated capillaries with open 'non-diaphragmed' fenestrae is approximately 15 nm (kidney glomerulus). In the case of the sinusoidal reticuloendothelial blood capillaries of myeloid bone marrow, the transvascular transport of non-endogenous macromolecules larger than 5 nm into the bone marrow interstitial space takes place via reticuloendothelial cell-mediated phago-endocytosis and transvascular release, which is the case for systemic bone marrow imaging agents as large as 60 nm in diameter. Conclusions The physiologic upper limit of pore size in the capillary walls of most non-sinusoidal blood capillaries to the transcapillary passage of lipid-insoluble endogenous and non-endogenous macromolecules ranges between 5 and 12 nm. Therefore, macromolecules larger than the physiologic upper limits of pore size in the non-sinusoidal <b>blood</b> <b>capillary</b> types generally do not accumulate within the respective tissue interstitial spaces and their lymphatic drainages. In the case of reticuloendothelial sinusoidal blood capillaries of myeloid bone marrow, however, non-endogenous macromolecules as large as 60 nm in diameter can distribute into the bone marrow interstitial space via the phago-endocytic route, and then subsequently accumulate in the locoregional lymphatic drainages of tissues following absorption into the lymphatic drainage of periosteal fibrous tissues, which is the lymphatic drainage of myeloid bone marrow. When the ultrastructural basis for transcapillary exchange across the capillary walls of different capillary types is viewed in this light, it becomes evident that the physiologic evidence for the existence of aqueous large pores ranging between 24 and 60 nm in diameter in the capillary walls of blood capillaries, is circumstantial, at best. </p...|$|E
