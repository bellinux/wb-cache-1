The shape of drift tubes was optimized to have maximum transit time factor with the fixed value of electric field at the surface (1. 5 value of Kilpatrick’s criterion). 3 D simulations were done to adjust optimized drift tubes with split-rings to have operating frequency and to unify dimensions of the cavities.

2500|$|Beyond the <b>buncher</b> grids is a space {{called the}} drift space. [...] This space is long {{enough so that}} the {{accelerated}} electrons catch up to the retarded electrons, forming [...] "bunches" [...] longitudinally along the beam axis. [...] Its length is chosen to allow maximum bunching at the resonant frequency, and may be several feet long.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} klystron tube is the two-cavity klystron. [...] In this tube {{there are}} two microwave cavity resonators, the [...] "catcher" [...] and the [...] "buncher". [...] When used as an amplifier, the weak microwave signal to be amplified {{is applied to the}} <b>buncher</b> cavity through a coaxial cable or waveguide, and the amplified signal is extracted from the catcher cavity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{electrons}} then {{pass through}} a second cavity, called the [...] "catcher", through a similar pair of grids {{on each side of}} the cavity. [...] The function of the catcher grids is to absorb energy from the electron beam. [...] The bunches of electrons passing through excite standing waves in the cavity, which has the same resonant frequency as the <b>buncher</b> cavity. [...] Each bunch of electrons passes between the grids at a point in the cycle when the exit grid is negative with respect to the entrance grid, so the electric field in the cavity between the grids opposes the electrons motion. [...] The electrons thus do work on the electric field, and are decelerated, their kinetic energy is converted to electric potential energy, increasing the amplitude of the oscillating electric field in the cavity. [...] Thus the oscillating field in the catcher cavity is an amplified copy of the signal applied to the <b>buncher</b> cavity. [...] The amplified signal is extracted from the catcher cavity through a coaxial cable or waveguide.|$|E

2500|$|An {{electronic}} oscillator {{can be made}} from a klystron tube, by providing a feedback path from output to input by connecting the [...] "catcher" [...] and [...] "buncher" [...] cavities with a coaxial cable or waveguide. [...] When the device is turned on, electronic noise in the cavity is amplified by the tube and fed back from the output catcher to the <b>buncher</b> cavity to be amplified again. [...] Because of the high Q of the cavities, the signal quickly becomes a sine wave at the resonant frequency of the cavities.|$|E
2500|$|The beam first {{passes through}} the [...] "buncher" [...] cavity resonator, through grids {{attached}} to each side. [...] The <b>buncher</b> grids have an oscillating AC potential across them, produced by standing wave oscillations within the cavity, excited by the input signal at the cavity's resonant frequency applied by a coaxial cable or waveguide. [...] The direction of the field between the grids changes twice per cycle of the input signal. [...] Electrons entering when the entrance grid is negative and the exit grid is positive encounter an electric field {{in the same direction}} as their motion, and are accelerated by the field. [...] Electrons entering a half-cycle later, when the polarity is opposite, encounter an electric field which opposes their motion, and are decelerated.|$|E

40|$|Positron {{lifetime}} spectroscopy is {{a powerful}} tool to identify vacancy type defects in semiconductor materials. Conventionally, applicability of the positron lifetime measurement has been limited to bulk samples. However, many interesting materials are nowadays available only as thin epitaxial samples. In order to measure these samples a positron lifetime beam is needed. This work describes the concept and {{the design of a}} pulsed low-energy positron lifetime beam facility. The theoretical background of the beam pulsing is reviewed. The construction of the pulsing system is presented in detail and results from electron and positron tests with this beam facility are introduced. As an application of the pulsed lifetime beam the results of the measurements on InN layers done at Universität der Bundeswehr are also presented. The pulsing system in this work is composed of three different components, two <b>bunchers</b> and a chopper. The <b>bunchers</b> modulate the beam velocity to create a time varying positron beam intensity and to result a very narrow positron bunch at the target.
