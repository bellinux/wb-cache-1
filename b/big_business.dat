5|$|In May 1965 the Rhodesian Front {{government}} went to {{the country}} in a general election with Van der Byl one of the leading campaigners. Discussion of unilaterally declaring independence had already begun. Van der Byl argued that {{only a small fraction of}} Rhodesian business opposed it; however, his campaign speeches typically included an argument against business involvement in politics. He cited Johannesburg mining interests' support for the Progressive Party in South Africa, <b>big</b> <b>business</b> support for the Nazi Party in Germany, and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia being financed by United States <b>big</b> <b>business.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite the Mulligan letters scandal, Blaine {{had succeeded}} remarkably in his 1880 campaign, {{attracting}} nationwide {{support for his}} candidacy. He argued for the gold standard, support for <b>big</b> <b>business,</b> a tariff to protect American jobholders, civil rights for freed blacks and Irish independence.|$|E
50|$|In fact, whereas {{informed}} publics {{in developed}} countries are more trusting of small than <b>big</b> <b>businesses</b> (76% vs. 53%), emerging market respondents placed more trust in <b>big</b> <b>businesses</b> (79% vs. 70%). Overall, small businesses are slightly more trusted than <b>big</b> <b>businesses</b> (70% vs. 62%).Looking at company types, the study finds that trust in media companies rose from 52% of informed publics globally in 2012 to 57% this year. Within the US, trust in media companies crossed into the majority, increasing from 45% to 51%.|$|R

5000|$|The {{study also}} looks at how {{consumers}} place their trust in corporations of different sizes. In the US, 86% of informed consumers trust small businesses, while just 55% trust <b>big</b> <b>businesses.</b> A similar gap {{is apparent in}} the UK (78% vs. 48%), but {{the opposite is true}} in China, where 89% trust <b>big</b> <b>businesses</b> compared to 65% for small businesses.|$|R
5|$|The {{issue of}} the tariff worked to the Republicans' {{advantage}} in 1888. The legislative revisions {{of the past four}} years also made imported goods so expensive that now many voters favored tariff reform and were skeptical of <b>big</b> <b>business.</b> Many Westerners, traditionally Republican voters, defected to James Weaver, the candidate of the new Populist Party. Weaver promised Free Silver, generous veterans' pensions, and an eight-hour work day. The Tammany Hall Democrats adhered to the national ticket, allowing a united Democratic party to carry New York. At the campaign's end, many Populists and labor supporters endorsed Cleveland after an attempt by the Carnegie Corporation to break the union during the Homestead strike in Pittsburgh and after a similar conflict between <b>big</b> <b>business</b> and labor at the Tennessee Coal and Iron Co. The final result was a victory for Cleveland by wide margins in both the popular and electoral votes, and it was Cleveland's third consecutive popular vote plurality.|$|E
5|$|A {{third major}} {{criticism}} of the Act {{is that it was}} poorly administered. The Act purposefully brought together competing interests (labor and business, <b>big</b> <b>business</b> and small business, etc.) in a coalition to support passage of the legislation, but these competing interests soon fought one another over the Act's implementation. As a consequence, NRA collapsed due to failure of leadership and confusion about its goals. By the end of 1934, NRA leaders had practically abandoned the progressive interventionist policy which motivated the Act's passage, and were supporting free-market philosophies—contributing to the collapse of almost all industry codes.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Taylor was {{attacked}} by Democratic opponents because of his party's support from black voters and its ties to <b>big</b> <b>business,</b> including the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. They also charged that Governor Bradley had run a corrupt administration. Republicans answered with charges of factionalism and use of political machinery by Democrats. In particular, they derided the Goebel Election Law, which Taylor claimed subverted {{the will of the}} people.|$|E

5|$|Most Democratic {{newspapers}} {{refused to}} support Bryan, the major exception being the New York Journal, controlled by William Randolph Hearst, whose fortune {{was based on}} silver mines. In biased reporting and through the sharp cartoons of Homer Davenport, Hanna was viciously characterized as a plutocrat, trampling on labor. McKinley was drawn as a child, easily controlled by <b>big</b> <b>business.</b> Even today, these depictions still color the images of Hanna and McKinley: one as a heartless businessman, the other as a creature of Hanna and others of his ilk.|$|E
5|$|Once war was declared, Voorhis {{supported}} the internment of Japanese-Americans, though {{he suggested that}} the evacuations be done in as voluntary a manner as possible and that officials be appointed to administer their property to avoid forced sales at bargain prices. During the war, Voorhis advocated more efficiently taxing higher incomes and war profits, planning against postwar unemployment, and planning for the nutritional needs of Americans. Voorhis also opposed dominance of <b>big</b> <b>business</b> in the war effort. Congress, for the most part, ignored Voorhis's pleas.|$|E
5|$|President Theodore Roosevelt {{appointed}} Landis {{a federal}} judge in 1905. Landis received national attention in 1907 when he fined Standard Oil of Indiana more than $29million for violating federal laws forbidding rebates on railroad freight tariffs. Though Landis was reversed on appeal, he was seen as a judge determined to rein in <b>big</b> <b>business.</b> During and after World War I, Landis presided over several high-profile trials of draft resisters and others whom he saw as opposing the war effort. He imposed heavy sentences on those who were convicted; some of the convictions were reversed on appeal, and other sentences were commuted.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} an {{examination}} of <b>businesses</b> that became <b>big</b> <b>businesses</b> in the United States during the time period between the years of 1861 and 1890, {{a period of time}} frequently referred to as the “big business era. ” The {{purpose of the study was}} to identify actions taken by businesses that enabled them to become and remain <b>big</b> <b>businesses.</b> A secondary purpose of the study was to show that these actions were explained by theories of Karl Marx and Max Weber. The results of the study showed that businesses which took specific actions were able to become and remain <b>big</b> <b>businesses</b> and these actions were explained by the theories of Marx and Weber. The results of the study demonstrate the ability of classical sociological theory to explain macro-level social change...|$|R
5|$|Taft upset some {{progressives}} {{by choosing}} Hitchcock as Chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), placing him {{in charge of}} the presidential campaign. Hitchcock was quick to bring in men closely allied with <b>big</b> <b>business.</b> Taft took an August vacation in Hot Springs, Virginia, where he irritated political advisors by spending more time on golf than strategy. After seeing a newspaper photo of Taft taking a large swing at a golf ball, Roosevelt warned him against candid shots.|$|E
5|$|The Malaysian {{government}} aims {{to balance}} economic growth with environmental protection, {{but has been}} accused of favouring <b>big</b> <b>business</b> over the environment. Some state governments are now trying to counter the environmental impact and pollution created by deforestation; and the federal government is trying to cut logging by 10percent each year. 28 national parks have been established; 23 in East Malaysia and five in the Peninsular. Tourism has been limited in biodiverse areas such as Sipadan island. Animal trafficking is a large issue, and the Malaysian government is holding talks with the governments of Brunei and Indonesia to standardise anti-trafficking laws.|$|E
5|$|Carl (Martin Sheen's character) {{represents}} {{the working class}} in the film: he is the union leader for the maintenance workers at Bluestar. He constantly attacks <b>big</b> <b>business,</b> money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and anything that he sees {{as a threat to}} his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's leftward leanings form the basis of the film's subtext. This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in Platoon. In Wall Street the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, a voice of reason amid the creative destruction brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.|$|E

In particular the formation of <b>big</b> <b>businesses</b> and the effect of their management system on management accounting are clarified. At the same time, this paper refers to a bipolar divergence between the <b>big</b> <b>businesses</b> and the defeated firms in this industry which was caused by the intense price competition...|$|R
50|$|Net {{neutrality}} is also {{at stake}} when media mergers occur. Net neutrality involves a lack of restrictions on content on the internet, however, with <b>big</b> <b>businesses</b> supporting campaigns financially {{they tend to have}} influence over political issues, which can translate into their mediums. These <b>big</b> <b>businesses</b> that also have control over internet usage or the airwaves could possibly make the content available biased from their political stand point or they could restrict usage for conflicting political views, therefore eliminating Net Neutrality.|$|R
5|$|In the pre-war years, Göring enjoyed {{widespread}} personal {{popularity among}} the German public {{because of his}} perceived sociability, colour and humour. As the Nazi leader most responsible for economic matters, he presented himself {{as a champion of}} national interests over allegedly corrupt <b>big</b> <b>business</b> and the old German elite. The Nazi press was on Göring's side. Other Nazi leaders, such as Hess and Ribbentrop, were envious of his popularity. Even in the political circles of Britain and the United States, there were those who viewed Göring as more acceptable than the other Nazis, and as a possible mediator between the western democracies and Hitler.|$|E
5|$|James Baird Weaver {{was born}} in Ohio, and moved to Iowa as a boy when his family claimed a {{homestead}} on the frontier. He became politically active {{as a young man}} and was an advocate for farmers and laborers, joining and quitting several political parties in the furtherance of the progressive causes in which he believed. After serving in the Union Army in the Civil War, Weaver returned to Iowa and worked for the election of Republican candidates. After making several unsuccessful attempts at Republican nominations to various offices, and growing dissatisfied with the conservative wing of the party, in 1877 Weaver switched to the Greenback Party, advocating an increased money supply and stricter regulation of <b>big</b> <b>business.</b> As a Greenbacker with Democratic support, Weaver won election to the House of Representatives in 1878.|$|E
5|$|James Baird Weaver (June 12, 1833– February 6, 1912) was {{a member}} of the United States House of Representatives and two-time {{candidate}} for President of the United States.

5|$|On October 5, 1949, Douglas made a radio {{appearance}} announcing her candidacy. She attacked Downey almost continuously {{throughout the}} remainder of the year, accusing him of being a do-nothing, a tool of <b>big</b> <b>business,</b> and an agent of oil interests. She hired Harold Tipton, a newcomer to California who had managed a successful congressional campaign in the Seattle area, as her campaign manager. Douglas realized that Nixon would most likely be the Republican nominee, and felt that were she to win the primary, the wide gap between Nixon's positions and hers would cause voters to rally to her. Downey, who suffered from a severe ulcer, was initially undecided about running, but announced his candidacy in early December in a speech that included an attack on Douglas. Earl Desmond, a member of the California State Senate from Sacramento whose positions were similar to Downey's, also entered the race.|$|E
5|$|The {{candidates}} were the same, but {{the issues of}} the campaign had shifted: free silver was still a question that animated many voters, but the Republicans focused on victory in war and prosperity at home as issues they believed favored their party. Democrats knew the war had been popular, even if the imperialism issue was less sure, so they focused on the issue of trusts and corporate power, painting McKinley as the servant of capital and <b>big</b> <b>business.</b> As in 1896, Bryan embarked on a speaking tour around the country while McKinley stayed at home, this time making only one speech, to accept his nomination. Roosevelt emerged as the campaign's primary speaker and Hanna helped the cause working to settle a coal miners strike in Pennsylvania. Bryan's campaigning failed to excite the voters as it had in 1896, and McKinley never doubted that he would be re-elected. On November 6, 1900, he was proven correct, winning the largest victory for any Republican since 1872. Bryan carried only four states outside the solid South, and McKinley even won Bryan's home state of Nebraska.|$|E
5|$|The {{democratic}} process was {{threatened by the}} Concerned South Africans Group (COSAG), an alliance of black ethnic-secessionist groups like Inkatha and far-right Afrikaner parties; in June 1993, one of the latter—the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB)—attacked the Kempton Park World Trade Centre. Following the murder of ANC activist Chris Hani, Mandela made a publicised speech to calm rioting, soon after appearing at a mass funeral in Soweto for Tambo, who {{had died of a}} stroke. In July 1993, both Mandela and de Klerk visited the US, independently meeting President Bill Clinton and each receiving the Liberty Medal. Soon after, Mandela and de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway. Influenced by Thabo Mbeki, Mandela began meeting with <b>big</b> <b>business</b> figures, and played down his support for nationalisation, fearing that he would scare away much-needed foreign investment. Although criticised by socialist ANC members, he had been encouraged to embrace private enterprise by members of the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist parties at the January 1992 World Economic Forum in Switzerland.|$|E

30|$|Second, the {{theoretical}} framework of <b>big</b> <b>businesses</b> {{based on the}} closed innovation economy is Schumpeter’s Monopolistic Practices, Closed Season, and Corporate Social Responsibility, {{as well as the}} theory of partnered growth of Un-Chan Chung and Jang-Woo Lee. If <b>big</b> <b>businesses</b> continuously pursue monopolistic behaviors and closed strategies, investment opportunities will vanish (Schumpeter, 1942, pp. 87, 111). In addition, if large companies directly and indirectly support the social innovation economy and creating shared value (CSV), it is essential to guarantee corporate social responsibility (CSR) for long-term survival (Holme & Watts, 1999; Porter & Kramer, 2011). The theory of partnered growth, which handles the win-win growth strategy and partnered growth between SMEs that represents the open innovation economy and <b>big</b> <b>businesses</b> that represent the closed innovation economy, also serve as {{the theoretical}} basis for a mutual, virtuous, cyclical relation between the open innovation economy and the closed innovation economy (Won-Chan 2013, p. 226; Jang-Woo Lee, 2011, p. 15).|$|R
