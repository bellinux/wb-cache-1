Then said he unto to me, 'Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these."— ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See how {{different}} I am from the miserable creature by the river! all because you found me and <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> very best." ...|$|E
60|$|Ten {{minutes of}} leisurely walking <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shady {{outskirts}} of Linrock and I entered {{the town with}} mingled feelings of curiosity, eagerness, and expectation.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> {{question}} <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> present {{again with}} a bound.|$|R
60|$|An hour's {{walk along}} the winding banks <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> round <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cottage which had once been Mary's home.|$|R
6000|$|How rare was hers, the loveliness of {{the woman}} I lost--of her whose loss <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{condition}} I attempt to depict! ...|$|R
6000|$|Again we {{stumbled}} on, and I {{began to}} grow melancholy, when another [...] "there he goes" [...] <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> [...] "ready," [...] with eager eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "That my visions {{were of the}} world, and <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cloister, {{and that}} yours were of the cloister and have brought you to the world." ...|$|E
60|$|A short dash <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the}} block; {{the side}} street was not so dark, and after I had crossed this open space I glanced backward.|$|E
60|$|A sudden jolt <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{immediate}} present, and the realisation that in {{the last}} few moments we had increased our pace. I put out my head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I {{not tell}} you that the gods were with us? Where is your faith, O White Man! Look! They have <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> land of which I am Prince." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They have <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Convent of <b>the</b> Holy Cross <b>to</b> kill <b>me</b> where I {{asked that}} I might be buried," [...] she murmured {{to herself as}} she descended from the litter.|$|R
6000|$|Could she by {{any human}} {{possibility}} {{have heard of}} the coming change in my life? Was she aware, before I had opened my lips, of the hard necessity which had <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you sure}} that you have <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right place?" [...] I asked the man who held the door open. [...] "This seems to be a warehouse. I think there must be some mistake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point," [...] she replied, [...] "which is {{no small}} triumph for your Excellency. Mr. Ritchie bought the {{miniature}} from that most estimable of my relations, Monsieur Auguste de St. Gre." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know other English, {{and some}} American, towns in winter," [...] said Mrs. Jefferson. [...] "When my husband found I {{could not stand}} the cold, he <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Canaries. I think I can sympathise with Betty." ...|$|R
60|$|That <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> {{humor of}} the thing, and I joined in their mirth.|$|R
60|$|After all we {{are very}} human. The {{dressing}} bugle <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> present, and I remembered that I was hungry. I descended into my state-room, and found all my things neatly laid out, and Guest sitting on the opposite bunk regarded them critically.|$|R
60|$|I {{was soon}} {{within sight of}} Mr. Peggotty's house, and of the light within it shining through the window. A little floundering across the sand, which was heavy, <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, and I went in.|$|E
60|$|When I had escorted {{my cousin}} Sibylle from the {{presence}} of the Emperor, I was surprised to find the same young hussar officer waiting outside who had commanded the guard which had <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp.|$|E
6000|$|... "She has <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crisis," [...] he muttered--"she or I am lost. There was something--I wot {{not if it}} {{was fear}} or pity--that {{prompted}} me to avoid this fatal crisis. It is now decided--she or I must PERISH." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>The</b> woman pointed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{packages}} with {{a little}} dramatic gesture. [...] "Oh, yes," [...] she said. [...] "I'm ready, though I'll have to leave most two hundred dollars' worth of clothes behind me. I've no use for taking in plain sewing while you think over what you've <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> in <b>the</b> penitentiary." ...|$|R
5000|$|Then he <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{door of the}} temple; {{and there}} was water, flowing from under the {{threshold}} of the temple toward the east, for the front of the temple faced east; the water was flowing from under {{the right side of the}} temple, south of the altar. (NKJV) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believed}} firmly that if I had not told--... I had {{bad times}} after that--crying {{at night and}} wool-gathering by day. For two terms I slackened and had bad reports. Do you remember? Of course you would! It was you--your beating me in mathematics that <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grind again." ...|$|R
60|$|I had {{followed}} this trail for perhaps {{a hundred yards}} when a sharp turn to the right <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mouth of a large cave. The opening was about four feet in height and three to four feet wide, and at this opening the trail ended.|$|E
60|$|I {{had seen}} him through one little affair {{connected}} with an idol that had <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> doors of a lunatic asylum, and I {{had no desire to}} help him through further experiences. He was a man to whom unpleasantnesses arrived as do dinners to ordinary people.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly. If it wasn't for Dorothy I {{should never}} have had brains. She lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Emerald City. So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never leave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It didn’t occur <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But {{there was}} Mills, who {{apparently}} believed in your existence. I could trust Mills. My doubts {{were about the}} propriety. I couldn’t see any good reason for being taken to see you. Strange {{that it should be}} my connection with the sea which <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> here <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Villa.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believed}} firmly that if I had not told-- [...] . [...] . I had {{bad times}} after that--crying {{at night and}} wool-gathering by day. For two terms I slackened and had bad reports. Do you remember? Of course you would! It was you--your beating me in mathematics that <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grind again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I may {{say with}} {{confidence}} {{that he never}} had occasion to regret his speculation. From the first it was a success. A few good cases and the reputation which I had won in <b>the</b> hospital <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> rapidly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front, and {{during the last few}} years I have made him a rich man.|$|R
6000|$|... 'After all,' said Leonard, {{recalled}} by his sympathy, 'it is my {{own fault}} {{from beginning to end}} that I am in this case. I see now that it was only God's mercy that prevented my brother's blood being on me, and it was my unrepenting obstinacy that <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mill; so there will be no real injustice in my dying, and I expect nothing else.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. In Kansas she was Dorothy Gale. I used to {{know her}} there, and she <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Land of Oz. But now Ozma has made her a Princess, and Dorothy's Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are here, too." [...] Here the Shaggy Man uttered a long sigh, and then he continued: [...] "It's a queer country, this Land of Oz; but I like it, nevertheless." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Boys," [...] {{interrupted}} Wilder, [...] "it is now proper {{that you}} dhould know something of my future movements. We have been shipmates, I might almost say messmates, {{for more than}} twenty years. I was better than an infant, Fid, when you <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> commander of your ship, and not only was instrumental in saving my life, but in putting me into a situation to make an officer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, papa!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I {{told you}} if you <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> market I felt sure I should know the boy again if I saw him. That's him, the one looking down into the basket. But he knew me again, for I saw him look {{surprised}} when he noticed me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some dry curacoa and a biscuit. And {{let it be}} <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in <b>the</b> picture-gallery. Damn the dog! I'll go {{and look}} at Hobbema." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A {{man took}} hold of my hand and tried to pull off my ring, and the nail jumped out and I was alive again. And when the camel heard me say [...] "Let him live who gave me life, slay him who slew me!" [...] it turned and <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> castle. That is my story.' ...|$|R
