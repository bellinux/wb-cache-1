Many industrial applications utilizing <b>beam-shaping</b> optical systems require more scalable production solutions and therefore effort has been invested in research regarding the automation of optics assembly. In previous works, the authors and other researchers have proven the feasibility of automated alignment of <b>beam-shaping</b> optics such as collimation lenses or homogenization optics. Nevertheless, the planning efforts as well as additional knowledge from the fields of automation and control required for such alignment processes are immense. This paper presents a novel approach of planning active alignment processes of <b>beam-shaping</b> optics with the focus of minimizing the planning efforts for active alignment. The approach utilizes optical simulation and the genetic programming paradigm from computer science for automatically extracting features from a simulated data basis with a high correlation coefficient regarding the individual degrees of freedom of alignment.

40|$|In this paper, the {{translational}} addition theorem for spherical functions {{is employed}} to exactly calculate the acoustic radiation force produced by an arbitrary shaped beam on a sphere suspended in an inviscid fluid. The radiation force {{is given in}} terms of the <b>beam-shape</b> and the scattering coefficients. Each <b>beam-shape</b> coefficient (BSC) is the complex weight of a multipole mode in partial-wave expansion of the incident beam. Moreover, they depend on the choice of the reference frame which is defined by the sphere's center. On the other hand, the scattering coefficients are obtained from the acoustic boundary conditions across the sphere's surface. Given a set of known BSCs, the translational addition theorem can be used to obtain the new coefficients relative to the sphere's position. Such approach is particularly useful when no closed-form expression of the incident pressure is known, but its BSCs are available. This is the case of a spherically focused ultrasound beam, for which we compute the radiation force on an absorbing compressible sphere arbitrarly placed in the fluid. The analysis is carried out in the Rayleigh and the resonant scattering regimes. It is shown that the focused beam may trap a spherical particle in the Rayleigh scattering regime.
