50|$|Later in 1943 the 004B version {{suffered}} {{turbine blade}} failures {{which were not}} understood by the Junkers team. They focussed on areas such as material defects, grain size and surface roughness. Eventually, in December, blade-vibration specialist Max Bentele was once again brought in during {{a meeting at the}} RLM headquarters. He identified that the failures were caused by one of the blades' natural frequencies being in the engine running range. His solution was to raise the frequency, by increasing the <b>blade</b> <b>taper</b> and shortening them by 1 millimeter, and to reduce the operating speed of the engine from 9,000 to 8,700 rpm.|$|E

A lot of metal is removed from the blade and is thus more {{difficult}} to grind, one factor that limits its commercial use. It sacrifices edge durability in favor of more sharpness.

50|$|After 1945, American {{soldiers}} {{returning home}} from Europe brought along individually purchased examples of what would {{become known as the}} Italian stiletto switchblade. Consumer demand for more of these knives resulted in the importation of large numbers of side-opening and telescoping blade switchblades, primarily from Italy. These imported switchblades were frequently referred to as stilettos, since most incorporated a long, slender <b>blade</b> <b>tapering</b> to a needle-like point, together with a slim-profile handle and vestigial cross-guard reminiscent of the medieval weapon.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{simultaneous}} variation in blade root chord length and <b>blade</b> <b>taper</b> on the control effort of helicopter flight control system (i. e., FCS) of a helicopter is investigated. Therefore, helicopter models (i. e., complex, control-oriented, and physics-based models) including the main physics and essential dynamics are used. The effect of simultaneous variation in the blade root chord length and <b>blade</b> <b>taper</b> (i. e., in both chordwise and lengthwise directions dependently) on the control effort of an FCS of a helicopter and also on the closed-loop responses is studied. Comparisons {{in terms of the}} control effort and peak values with and without variations in the blade root chord and <b>blade</b> <b>taper</b> changes are carried out.

Design variables encompass <b>blade</b> <b>taper</b> ratio, box beam dimensions, and the magnitudes of the nonstructural weights. Optimum designs have been obtained for both rectangular and tapered blades; attention is given to the optimum blade weight effect and the blade mass and stiffness distribution effects of adding constraints on higher frequencies and stresses...|$|E

5000|$|The blade on {{the sword}} is very wide, which {{is typical of}} Viking swords. The <b>blade</b> <b>tapers</b> to a point and is 79 centimeters long. The blade has an {{inscription}} of ULFBERHT, a Rhineland manufacturer. [...] About 200 of these blades have been discovered {{as far away as}} Russia, suggesting that this was the early equivalent of an ‘international brand’. While the blade was imported, the hilt and pommel were made by Vikings. The upper side bears the name HILTIPREHT, which seems to connect it to a Norwegian craftsman of that name.|$|R
40|$|Formal {{mathematical}} programing {{was applied}} to the aerodynamic rotor blade design process. The approach is to couple hover and forward flight analysis programs with the general-purpose optimization program CONMIN to determine the <b>blade</b> <b>taper</b> ratio, percent taper, twist distribution, and solidity which minimize the horsepower required at hover while meeting constraints on forward flight performance. Designs obtained using this approach for the blade of a representative Army helicopter compare well with those obtained using a conventional approach involving personnel-intensive parametric studies. Results from the present method can be obtained in 2 days as compared to 5 weeks required by the conventional procedure. Also the systematic manipulation of the design variables by the optimization procedure minimizes the need for the researcher to have a vast body of past experience and data in determining the influence of a design change on the performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} many of the {{parameters}} significant to wi ~ flutter were studied experimentally on several untwisted rotating models to determine their significance tith respect to stall flutter of propeller blades. The parameters included torsional stiffness, section thickness ratio, sweepback, length-chord ratio, section center-of-gravity location, <b>blade</b> <b>taper,</b> Mach number, and fluid density. In order to check on the & effects of blade twist, one model which had spanwise twist was studied. The blade angles of the models were generally varied from low values to 4 beyond the stall. The experimental results for the flutter speed are presented in the form of flutter-speed coefficients (V~) o. &, where the quantities V and b are the resultant velocity and semichord, respectively, taken at 0. 8 blade length L, and q is the natural first-torsion circular fre-quency of the blade. The minimum values of this flutter-speed coefficient were found to be slightly greater than 1. 0 for subcritical Mach numbers...|$|E
40|$|Some area in Indonesia such as {{southern}} part of Sumatra to Nusa Tenggara have big enough wind speed to produce electrical energy by using wind turbine. However, the potential resources are not yet fully developed, and only 1. 4 GW electrical energy has been generating in the Indonesia region. Most of the wind energy generating equipment is designed to the European wind speed which is 10 - 30 knot. So, {{it is very important}} to modify the such equipment to be able to implement in Indonesia area which is have a lower wind speed. The purpose of this research is to know the influence of number of blades and wind speed to electricity generated by horizontal axis wind turbine with <b>blade</b> <b>taper</b> inversed linear. The result showed that the highest electrical output power was 2, 02 watt produced by 5 blades and 3, 5 m/s wind speed.

The inflorescence arises on one or more stems 20 to 60 centimeters tall, each stem bearing an array of up to 100 flowers each. Near the flowers are small, pointed bracts tipped with resin glands. The flower has 6 or 7 petals, each up to about a centimeter in length and lance-shaped with a toothed tip. The petals are pale pink with sharp dark pink veining. The throat is sometimes tinged with greenish yellow.|$|R
40|$|An {{enhanced}} integrated aerodynamic load/dynamic optimization {{procedure is}} developed to minimize vibratory root shears and moments. The optimization is formulated with 4 /rev vertical and 3 /rev inplane shears at the blade root as objective functions and constraints, and 4 /rev lagging moment. Constraints are also imposed on blade natural frequencies, weight, autorotational inertia, centrifugal stress, and rotor thrust. The 'Global Criteria Approach' {{is used for}} formulating the multi-objective optimization. Design variables include spanwise distributions of bending stiffnesses, torsional stiffness, nonstructural mass, chord, radius of gyration, and <b>blade</b> <b>taper</b> ratio. The program CAMRAD is coupled with an optimizer, which consists of the program CONMIN and an approximate analysis, to obtain optimum designs. The optimization procedure is applied to an advanced rotor as a reference design. Optimum blade designs, obtained with and without a constraint on the rotor thrust, are presented and are compared to the reference blade. Substantial reductions are obtained in the vibratory root forces and moments. As a byproduct, improvements are also found in some performance parameters, such as total power required, which were not considered during optimization...|$|E
40|$|This work {{examined}} the wake aerodynamics of a sin-gle helicopter rotor blade with several tip shapes operat-ing on a hover test stand. Velocity eld measurements were conducted using three-component laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). The objective of these measure-ments was {{to document the}} vortex velocity proles and then extract the core properties, such as the core radius, peak swirl velocity, and axial velocity. The measured test cases covered {{a wide range of}} wake-ages and several tip shapes, including rectangular, tapered, swept, and a subwing tip. One of the primary differences shown by the change in tip shape was the wake geometry. The effect of <b>blade</b> <b>taper</b> reduced the initial peak swirl veloc-ity by a signicant fraction. It appears that this is ac-complished by decreasing the vortex strength for a given blade loading. The subwing measurements showed that the interaction and merging of the subwing and primary vortices created a less coherent vortical structure. A source of vortex core instability is shown to be the ra-tio of the peak swirl velocity to the axial velocity decit. The results show {{that if there is a}} turbulence producin...|$|E
40|$|A {{mixed-flow}} impeller {{was designed}} to give a prescribed blade-surface velocity distribution at mean blade height for a given hub-shroud profile. The blade shape at mean blade height, which was produced by the prescribed velocity distribution, was extended by means of radial lines to form the composite blade shape from hub to shroud. The resulting blade was relatively thick; therefore, {{it was necessary to}} retain the inverse <b>blade</b> <b>taper</b> which resulted from extension of the radial lines in order to prevent merging or near merging of the separate blades near the hub. For the first test version of the impeller, designated the MFI- 2 A, the blade height was arbitrarily made greater than that for the basic impeller (the MFI- 2) to allow for viscous effects. At design equivalent speed of 1400 feet per second the peak pressure ratio and maximum adiabatic efficiency were 3. 95 and 79 percent, respectively. The adiabatic efficiency of the MFI- 2 A is four points lower than that for impeller model MFI- 1 A, but because of the higher slip factor for the MFI- 2 A, the pressure ratios are approximately equal. The procedures followed {{in the design of the}} MFI- 1 A and MFI- 2 A were, in general, the same; and, although the prescribed initial condition resulted in geometrical configurations that were quite dissimilar, the resulting performance characteristics compare favorably with designs for which considerable development work has been necessary...|$|E
50|$|The sword shows {{a number}} of {{features}} that indicate its intent as a thrusting weapon. The spear point and double edge towards the point aids penetration and withdrawal by incising the wound edges. The blade, whilst quite narrow, is thick and its dumbbell section gives it good weak-axis buckling strength whilst maintaining robustness in bending for the parry. The <b>blade</b> <b>tapers</b> in both width and thickness and, with the substantial guard, has a hilt-biased balance, aiding agility {{at the expense of}} concussive force in a cut. The guard gives comprehensive protection to the hand, but does not restrict wrist movement. The length of the double edge, at 17 in, is quite significant, suggesting that some cutting capability was maintained.|$|R

40|$|A {{helicopter}} rotor in {{descent flight}} encounters its own wake, {{resulting in a}} doughnut-shaped ring around the rotor disk, known as the Vortex Ring State (VRS). Flight in VRS condition can be dangerous as it may cause uncommanded drop in descent rate, loss of control effectiveness, power settling, excessive thrust and torque fluctuations, and vibration. As simple momentum theory is no longer valid for a rotor in VRS, modeling of rotor inflow in VRS continues to challenge researchers, especially for flight simulation applications. In this dissertation, a simplified inflow model, called the ring vortex model, is developed for a helicopter rotor operating in descent condition. By creating a series of vortex rings near the rotor disk, the ring vortex model addresses the strong flow interaction between the rotor wake and the surrounding airflow in descent flight. In addition, the total mass flow parameter in the existing inflow models is augmented to create a steady state transition between the helicopter and the windmill branches. With the ring vortex model, rotor inflow can now be adequately predicted {{over a wide range}} of descent rates. Validations of the ring vortex model for helicopter rotors are conducted extensively in axial and inclined descent. Effects from <b>blade</b> <b>taper,</b> blade twist, and rotor thrust are also investigated with further application of the finite-state inflow model. The ring vortex model is applied to a single main-rotor helicopter. The main effort is to establish VRS boundary based on heave stability criterion. In addition, two important phenomena observed in the descent flight tests are addressed in the dynamic simulation, including uncommanded drop in descent rate and loss of collective control effectiveness. The ring vortex model is further applied to a side-by-side rotor configuration. Lateral thrust asymmetry on the side-by-side rotor configuration can be reproduced through uneven distribution of vortex rings at the two rotors. Two important issues are investigated, including the impact of vortex rings on lateral thrust deficit and on lateral AFCS limit. Ph. D.

Several tests were also conducted to determine the effect of variation in directional control on the hovering performance of the coaxial rotor. A comparison of the measured static-thrust performance of the rotor with that predicted by hovering-performance theory is also presented. Included to substantiate the comparison with hovering theory are some previously obtained static-thrust results of another coaxial rotor of higher solidity and different blade geometry.
