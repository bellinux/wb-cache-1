5000|$|Nuno felting is {{a fabric}} felting {{technique}} developed by Polly Stirling, a fiber artist from New South Wales, Australia, around 1992. The name {{is derived from}} the Japanese word [...] "nuno" [...] meaning cloth. The technique bonds loose fibre, usually wool, into a sheer fabric such as silk gauze, creating a lightweight felt. The fibres can completely cover the background fabric, or they may be used as a decorative design that allows the <b>backing</b> <b>fabric</b> to show. Nuno felting often incorporates several layers of loose fibres combined to build up colour, texture, and/or design elements in the finished fabric.|$|E
50|$|Corded {{quilting}} (also {{known as}} Marseilles quilting, Marseilles embroidery, marcella, or Zaans stitchwork) is a decorative quilting technique popular {{from the late}} 17th through the early 19th centuries. In corded quilting, a fine fabric, sometimes colored silk but more often white linen or cotton, is backed with a loosely woven fabric. Floral or other motifs are outlined in parallel rows of running stitches or backstitches to form channels, and soft cotton cord is inserted through the <b>backing</b> <b>fabric</b> using a blunt needle and drawn along the quilted channels to produce a raised effect. Tiny quilting stitches in closely spaced rows fill the motifs and provide contrast to the corded outlines.|$|E

5000|$|The lace is {{worked on}} fabric which is {{stretched}} tightly in a frame. The pattern is {{drawn on the}} fabric and the threads which go to-and-fro across the circular motif are either taken through running stitches worked along the pattern lines or stitched directly through the fabric. When finished, the motifs are released by either cutting the running stitches or cutting away the <b>backing</b> <b>fabric.</b> While single motifs can be worked like this, it is more usual to work the whole item as one piece - the pattern for the complete mat or collar is drawn on the fabric and the wheels are linked together as the radial threads are laid down.|$|E
5000|$|Therese Quilt (1969) {{features}} {{an image of}} May's face that was reproduced eighty times and traced onto eighty different fabrics. Each tracing was then cut identically into pieces and reassembled like a miniature jigsaw puzzle so that each portrait is composed of different fabrics and no two blocks are the same. The portraits were then machine appliqu√©d to a <b>backing</b> <b>fabric.</b> The fabrics, which were obtained from used clothing that was purchased in thrift shops, [...] "zing and clash, rather than coordinate." [...] In describing the quilt, Laury wrote, [...] "The pattern of hexagonal shapes is so reminiscent of old quilts {{that it is a}} delightful jolt to have the faces emerge from the pattern." [...] May stated that these self-portraits reflect human nature in that, [...] "We are the same person and yet we are never the same. With each passing hour we are slightly different."

50|$|Trapunto is {{a sewing}} {{technique}} where {{two layers of}} fabric surrounding a layer of batting are quilted together, and then additional material is added to {{a portion of the}} design to increase the profile of relief as compared {{to the rest of the}} work. The effect of the elevation of one portion is often heightened by closely quilting the surrounding region, to compress the batting layer in that part of the quilt, thus receding the background even further. Cording techniques may also be used, where a channel is created by quilting, and a cord or yarn is pulled through the batting layer, causing a sharp change in the texture of the quilt. For example, several pockets may be quilted in the pattern of a flower, and then extra batting pushed through a slit in the <b>backing</b> <b>fabric</b> (which will later be sewn shut). The stem of the rose might be corded, creating a dimensional effect. The background could be quilted densely in a stipple pattern, causing the space around the rose bush to become less prominent. These techniques are typically executed with wholecloth quilts, and with batting and thread that matches the top fabric. Some artists have used contrasting colored thread, to create an outline effect. Colored batting behind the surface layer can create a shadowed effect. Brightly colored yarn cording behind white cloth can give a pastel effect on the surface.|$|E

These ethics and aesthetics applied equally to the other art forms in which Counts worked. Counts' [...] "discipleship" [...] following his apprenticeship with Marguerite Wildenhain shows clearly with stark realistic representation of natural images used for three dimensional motifs on pots. Counts translated his motifs from nature on three dimensional pots to two dimensional murals created with ceramic [...] "tiles" [...] to tufted rugs and quilt designs, He adopted applique forms with curving lines of quilting stitches, frames of color unifying his quilt and images on batik dyed fabrics, Counts took advantage of products of local fabric mills and developed a partnership with the Rising Fawn Quilters, traditional Appalachian craftspeople who brought needlework skill that complemented the non-traditional character of Count's designs. Counts bemoaned the fact that established designs had creates a loss of creativity in traditional quilts. His designs were very different from traditional geometric quilts. After the [...] "sandwich" [...] of quilt top, wadding or batting and the <b>backing</b> <b>fabric</b> were placed into the quilting frame and the quilt was rolled around the side bars of the quilting frame making the center of the quilt accessible.

40|$|Unconventional {{textiles}} are goods {{obtained by}} methods {{other than the}} classic spinning, weaving and knitting.

40|$|Approximately 5 billion lbs of carpet will {{be removed}} from {{buildings}} in the US each year for the foreseeable future. This carpet is potentially a valuable resource because it contains plastic {{in the face of}} the carpet that can be re-used. However, there are many different types of carpet, and at least four major different plastics used to make the face. The face is woven through a <b>backing</b> <b>fabric</b> and held in place by a ‚Äúglue‚Äù that is in most cases a latex cross-linked polymer which is heavily loaded with chalk (calcium carbonate). This backing has almost no value as a recycled material. In addition, carpet is a bulky material that is difficult to handle and ship and must be kept dry. It would be of significant benefit to the public if this stream of material could be kept out of landfills and some of its potential value unlocked by having high volume alternatives for recycled carpet use. The research question that this project investigated was whether carpet could be used as a fuel in a cement kiln. If this could be done successfully, there is significant capacity in the US cement industry to absorb carpet and use it as a fuel. Cement kilns could serve as a way to stimulate carpet collection and then side streams be taken for higher value uses. The research demonstrated that carpet was technically a suitable fuel, but was unable to conclude that the overall system could be economically feasible at this time with the constraints placed on the project by using an existing system for feeding the kiln. Collection and transportation were relatively straightforward, using an existing collector who had the capacity to collect high volumes of material. The shredding of the carpet into a suitable form for feeding was more challenging, but these problems were successfully overcome. The feeding of the carpet into the kiln was not successfully carried out reliably. The overall economics were not positive under the prevailing conditions of costs for transportation and size reduction...|$|E

50|$|Slip {{stitches}} may be {{used for}} an easier method of double knitting that requires only one yarn be handled at one time. As a concrete example, consider a two-color pattern with a multiple of four stitches (labeled ABCD) being knit on double-pointed circular needles. On the first row, using color 1, stitch A is knitted, stitch B is purled, stitch C is slipped wyib and stitch D is slipped wyif. The knitter then slides the stitches back to the beginning (recall that the needles are double-pointed). Then, using color 2, stitch A is slipped wyib, stitch B is slipped wyif, stitch C is knitted and stitch D is purled. The knitter then turns the work and repeats indefinitely. The knitted and slipped wyib stitches come forward, whereas the purled and wyif stitches recede, resulting in a (very warm!) double-knit scarf alternating in the two colors with beautiful drape. The knit and purl stitches produce the front and <b>back</b> <b>fabrics,</b> respectively, of the double-knitted fabric while the slipped stitches allow for the alternation of color.|$|R
