40|$|For the {{evaluation}} of immunological tests during an epidemiological survey and of vaccination with the PI <b>brucellin</b> vaccine, in an occupationally exposed environment, a sample group of 354 subjects was studied. The vaccinal strategy {{was based on the}} outcome of a skin test for hypersensitivity : the PS <b>brucellin</b> test. In this framewordk, the serological status and evolution of individuals with positive or negative reactions to this test were analysed. Sera were studied using the buffered antigen test, indirect fluorescence immunoassay and Wright's agglutination test, as well as by PACIA and ELISA techniques with assay of IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies. The PS test, which was pivotal in this study, was compared with the lymphoblastic transformation test. One prominent aspect of this evaluation was the establishment of conventional prognostic indices for the PS and serology. The PS is definitely shown to be a convenient, reliable tool for screening. Although it does not generate sensitivity it may modify the serological status of both positive and negative individuals...|$|E

Poly A:U did not augment the protective antibodies formed in response to infection. Although poly A:U has been previously found to suppress brucellosis in athymic (nude) mice, it did not enhance the thymus-dependent antibody response to sheep erythrocytes in brucella-infected nudes, suggesting that it did not significantly enhance maturation of their helper T-cell percursors...|$|E
40|$|Brucellosis, {{caused by}} {{bacteria}} {{of the genus}} Brucella, is a contagious disease that causes economic loss to owners of domestic animals due to loss of progeny and milk yield. Because cattle, sheep, goats, {{and to a lesser}} extent pigs are considered to be the source of human brucellosis, serological tests have been used to screen domestic animals for antibodies against Brucella. Although the serological tests helped to eradicate brucellosis in many countries, serological tests are not always adequate to detect latent carriers of Brucella. Therefore, the use of the skin delayed-type hypersensitivity (SDTH) test, which is independent of circulating antibodies, might improve the diagnosis of brucellosis. In the literature, however, there are conflicting reports as to the value of the SDTH test for the diagnosis of brucellosis. Some studies consider the test unreliable, whereas others advocate its use because it detects brucellosis earlier than serological tests. The objectives of this study were therefore to assess the characteristics of the SDTH test, to select a Brucella strain that will yield a suitable <b>brucellin</b> for use in the field, and to determine whether the use of serological tests in combination with the SDTH test improves the detection of brucellosis. The results of this study clearly show that the SDTH test detects latent carriers of Brucella and confirms brucellosis in cattle with ambiguous serological test results. Brucellins prepared from smooth or mucoid strains of Brucella are better suited for use in the field than brucellins prepared from rough strains because they detect brucellosis in cattle with acute as well as chronic infection. The SDTH test is highly specific (99. 3 % specificity), and repeated testing of naive cattle or cattle infected with microorganisms that serologically cross-react with Brucella does not sensitize cattle to subsequent SDTH tests. However, it is possible that some naive cattle may serologically react to the injection of <b>brucellin.</b> The effect of these serological reactions on the sero-diagnosis of brucellosis is limited, because cattle may only now and then react serologically either with the serum agglutination test (SAT) or the complement fixation test (CFT). Nevertheless, cattle infected with microorganisms that serologically cross-react with Brucella may test seropositive for brucellosis 4 to 7 weeks after injection of <b>brucellin,</b> depending on the cross-reacting microorganism. The value of the SDTH test for the diagnosis of brucellosis was demonstrated after an outbreak of brucellosis. When the SDTH test was used in combination with SAT and CFT at diagnostic threshold ≥ 2 mm or ≥ 1 mm (increase in skinfold thickness), respectively, 39 / 44 (88 %) or 42 / 44 (95 %) of the infected cattle were detected compared with only 27 / 44 (61 %) when SAT and CFT were used. When cattle in areas of low prevalence or in areas free from brucellosis are tested with the SDTH test an increase ≥ 2 mm in skinfold thickness should be considered indicative of infection. When the control and eradication of brucellosis is based on test-and-slaughter, an increase of ≥ 1 mm in skinfold thickness should be considered indicative of infection. Repeated serological testing complemented with the SDTH test in this programme will shorten the quarantine (movement control) period of a suspect herd, limiting the financial loss incurred during outbreaks of the disease. Consequently, since the SDTH test usually does not interfere with the serological diagnosis and can safely be used to establish the infection status of cattle in a suspect herd, it is opportune to consider adding the SDTH test to the procedure currently used to diagnose brucellosis in individual animals...|$|E

A lambda gt 11 genomic library of Brucella abortus was screened with a monoclonal antibody specific for P 39, and the gene coding for this protein was subsequently isolated.

40|$|Eight-hundred-and-ninety-six cattle {{belonging}} to herds officially designated Brucella-free, and 190 cattle {{belonging to}} infected herds were tested with the skin delayed-type hypersensitivity (SDTH) test, using <b>brucellin</b> (273) prepared from a rnucoid strain of Brucella abortus. An increase in skinfold thickness ≥ 2 mm {{was considered a}} positive SDTH test. The serum agglutination test, complement fixation test and bacteriological examination were used to confirm SDTH test results. Results show that 6 of the 896 uninfected cattle tested positive in the SDTH test, indicating a 99. 3 % specificity. Of the 44 cattle that tested serologically or bacteriologically positive, 33 tested positive in the SDTH test, indicating a 75 % sensitivity. The value of the SDTH test was demonstrated by its ability to detect infection earlier than serological tests, and by confirming infection in cattle with ambiguous serological test results. An increase in skinfold thickness ≥ 1 mm in cattle in suspected herds should not be ignored, as it may indicate specific sensitization.

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) implemented {{for the detection of}} gamma interferon (g-interferon) production in cattle vaccinated with Brucella abortus strain RB 51 are presented. A purified protein fraction derived from RB 51 (RB 51 <b>brucellin)</b> has been used as antigenic stimulus for whole blood. The test was evaluated for 300 days in ten heifers vaccinated at calfhood with 10 × 109 colony-forming units of RB 51 and in five control heifers. All animals came from officially brucellosis-free herds. Vaccinated animals started to give positive results from day 17 post vaccination (pv) until day 239 pv. All vaccinated animals gave a positive reaction at least once (with a stimulation index exceeding 2. 5). Nevertheless, if sampling on day 20 pv is excluded (90 % of vaccinated animals gave positive results), the sensitivity of the test varies from 20 % to 70 %, with a 40 % average. A stimulation index over 2. 5 was also recorded in three control animals. The results suggest that the g-interferon test is not suitable for the detection of cattle vaccinated with RB 51, either at the individual or at the herd level...|$|E
40|$|A delayed-type {{hypersensitivity}} (DTH) {{reaction in}} the course of brucellosis in humans and animals can be revealed by the <b>brucellin</b> INRA (Brucellergen) skin test. Brucellergen is composed of more than 20 proteins of different molecular weights. A 12 -kDa protein eliciting DTH in Brucella melitensis Rev 1 -sensitized guinea pigs was found to be a significant component for the allergenic properties of Brucellergen. Sequencing of the gene encoding this protein identified it as the L 7 /L 12 ribosomal protein. The L 7 /L 12 gene of B. melitensis was amplified by PCR and subcloned in the Escherichia coli pQE 30 plasmid. The resulting recombinant protein did not produce a DTH reaction in sensitized animals. It was used to raise specific antibodies in a rabbit. Affinity chromatography with these antibodies was used to isolate a single protein from Brucellergen and from B. melitensis cytosol preparations which produced a DTH reaction in guinea pigs sensitized with B. melitensis Rev 1. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the protein confirmed that it was the L 7 /L 12 ribosomal protein. This is the first complete report on the involvement of a defined bacterial ribosomal protein in the DTH response of animals infected with intracellularly multiplying bacteria...|$|E

Results of the in vitro lymphocyte transformation test were consistently positive for all 9 Brucella-infected heifers while the skin test was consistently positive for 6 of the 9 heifers. In 7 heifers repeatedly vaccinated with B. abortus strain- 19 vaccine the in vitro test classified 3 animals as positive whereas the skin test identified all the animals as infected {{during most of the}} experimental period. Four heifers injected with a single dose of B. abortus strain 19 were consistently negative to the lymphocyte transformation test while the skin test classified all the animals as infected during most of the experimental period. The skin test gave strong reactions indicative of Brucella infection in heifers vaccinated with 'Duphavac' and 'Abortox' vaccines whereas the lymphocyte transformation test was consistently negative with these vaccines. The two tests were negative in unexposed cattle. It was concluded that the in vitro test correlated better with Brucella isolation than the in vivo test did and that the lack of agreement between the results of the two tests is likely to be due to the different antigens used in the assays...|$|E

No single serological test and antigen combination showed 100 % sensitivity and specificity simultaneously. Immunoprecipitation tests with native hapten polysaccharide, counterimmunoelectrophoresis with cytosolic proteins, and a chaotropic ELISA with Brucella S-LPS were 100 % specific but less sensitive than the Rose Bengal test, complement fixation, and indirect ELISA with Brucella S-LPSs and native hapten or S-LPS-derived polysaccharides.

In the animals tested, O. anthropi cytosolic proteins evoked a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction of a frequency and intensity similar to that observed with B. melitensis <b>brucellin.</b> O. anthropi cytosolic proteins also reacted in gel precipitation tests with antibodies in sera from Brucella natural hosts with a frequency similar to that observed with B. melitensis proteins, and absorption experiments and immunoblotting showed antibodies to both Brucella-specific proteins and proteins common to Brucella and O. anthropi. No antibodies to O. anthropi cytosolic proteins were detected in the sera of Brucella-free hosts. Immunoblotting with sera of Brucella-infected sheep and goats showed immunoglobulin G (IgG) to Brucella group 3 outer membrane proteins and to O. anthropi proteins of similar molecular weight. No IgG to the O-specific polysaccharide of O. anthropi lipopolysaccharide was detected in the sera of Brucella-infected hosts. The sera of sheep, goats, and rabbits infected with B. melitensis contained IgG to O. anthropi rough lipopolysaccharide and lipid A, and B. ovis and O. anthropi rough lipopolysaccharides showed equal reactivities with IgG in the sera of B. ovis-infected rams.

40|$|Abstract Since 1998, {{there has}} been a steady decline in herd {{restrictions}} and de-populations in Ireland due to bovine brucellosis. There is concern that the interpretation of laboratory results may become increasingly problematic, as brucellosis prevalence falls in Ireland. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to evaluate the infection status of Irish herds and animals with inconclusive serological evidence of bovine brucellosis. During 12 months from September 1, 2004, laboratory and observational epidemiological data were collected from all Irish herds where animal testing identified at least one animal with a complement fixation test (CFT) reading greater than zero and/or a positive result to the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA). Due to the observational nature of the study, we have robust estimates of the relative, but not the absolute, performance of the CFT, iELISA and <b>brucellin</b> skin test (BST). Herds were divided into three categories (Group A, B or C) on the basis of test results at initial assessment. A total of 639 herds were enrolled into the study, and observed {{for at least two years}} following enrolment. A rising CFT titre, with a CFT reading of 111 International CFT Units (IU) or greater at the subsequent blood test, was generally associated with herds where other evidence of infection was also available. Knowledge of the CFT reading at the initial and a subsequent blood test proved useful in distinguishing false-positive and true-positive brucellosis results. There was poor correlation between the CFT and iELISA results, and between the CFT and BST results. As a result of this study, national policy has been modified to include re-sampling of all animals with CFT readings of 20 IU or greater. This project has also led to a reduction in the number of herds restricted, as well as restriction duration. It has also contributed to a reduction in the number of herds listed for contiguous tests, and therefore the potential for contiguity testing of false positive results. </p...|$|E
40|$|Brucellosis is {{a disease}} of {{socio-economic}} and zoonotic importance worldwide. In animals it {{is associated with the}} ingestion of feed that is contaminated with cyetic material from aborting herd-mates, while in humans it is associated with the consumption of unpasteurised milk and dairy products from infected animals. It may also be acquired from contact with infected material of animal origin by farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir and laboratory workers. Brucellosis was first reported in South Africa in the late nineteenth century. It is still present in the country today, with reported annual losses of at least R 300 million, and a national annual incidence of 5 000 cases in humans. The global incidence of human brucellosis is about half a million infections annually. As the incidence of human brucellosis is directly associated with prevalence in animals, control of animal brucellosis is emphasised. Veterinary control is compromised by the chronic nature and the variable incubation period of the disease, with an estimated up to 15 % of cattle in infected herds aborting before sero-conversion. Latency, which involves about 5 % of calves born from infected dams, is also problematic as these infected animals often test seronegative, only to seroconvert in the peri-parturient period, thus allowing opportunity for disease spread within and between herds before diagnosis is made. In addition, the currently used serological tests are at times unable to distinguish brucellosis from cross-reacting antibodies from other infections or brucellosis vaccines. x It was the objective of this study to investigate, under South African conditions, the value of the <b>brucellin</b> skin test (BST) in improving the sensitivity and specificity of the currently used serological tests. It has proved a valuable additional test in diagnosing early and latent infections as well as in differentiating brucellosis from cross-reacting organisms in unvaccinated cattle in Europe. The study also evaluated the benefit of replacing some of the currently used serological assays with the fluorescence polarisation assay (FPA). The FPA, a rapid and homogenous serological test with only a few operational steps, has been validated and is in current use in Canada. The study was carried out in Mpumalanga Province, on herds selected to reflect prevailing South African farming conditions. These herds were divided into certified Brucella abortus-negative herds (608 head) for the estimation of BST specificity, and confirmed B. abortus-infected herds (845 head) for the estimation of BST sensitivity. The results obtained indicated the BST had a specificity of 99. 18 %, and a relative sensitivity of 42. 86 %. However, 65. 38 % of BST-positive animals were negative on serology. When the high specificity is considered, together with the experiences of other researchers who found that the skin test became positive earlier than serological tests, these animals may be assumed infected. It is concluded that the BST is a valuable addition to the panel of diagnostic tests currently used to identify infected herds and individuals in South Africa. The FPA, with a relative sensitivity of 93. 65 % and a specificity of 98. 85 %, can potentially be of use as a screening test under South African conditions.

40|$|Recombinant {{proteins}} and generation of immune response L 7 /L 12 50 S ribosomal protein is a promising candidate {{because it has}} given good results in mice models. Further, <b>Brucellin</b> INRA (sLPS free cytosolic extract from rough B. melitensis B 115) which is a purified protein used in skin test to screen positive cases of brucellosis fails to elicit a delayed type hyperimmune (DTH) response, when the L 7 /L 12 fraction {{is removed from the}} purified protein (Bachrach et al., 1994). L 7 /L 12 ribosomal protein participates in bacterial protein synthesis by binding elongation factor G and TU. Like any other ribosomal protein this 12 kDa protein encoded by a 375 bp gene is also conserved across many genera of bacteria like E. coli, Mycobacteria etc. The exact antigenic motif recognized by the host immune system has not yet been elucidated. L 7 /L 12 with its helix turn helix DNA binding motif makes it a suitable candidate to screen for putative T cell epitopes (Rice and Steitz, 1989). Any vaccine against brucellosis should give a predominantly Th 1 mediated immune response to clear the infection. IFN-γ (interferon) and TNF-α have been implicated as key cytokines needed to confer protection against the disease. Recombinant antigens and DNA vaccines Among the recombinant antigens that have been tested, HtrA, GroEL, GroES, UvrA and YajC induced cellular and humoral immune responses in mice, but only the L 7 /L 12 (Oliveira and Splitter, 1996; Oliveria et al., 1994) elicited some level of protection. So there is a agreement between the present work and previous studies. E. coli expressing the Cu/Zn SOD also conferred a significant level of protection (1. 77 log units) (Onate et al. 1999). Onate et al. (1999) also reported that the complete Cu/Zn SOD protein could induce a protective immune response in mice. But that report was contradictory with the results of Tabatabai and Pugh (1994) who were unable to induce a protective immune response in mice using a combination of adjuvants and purified recombinant Cu/Zn SOD protein as the vaccine antigen, although some level of protection was induced with synthetic peptides of the protein and adjuvant. DNA vaccination is a relatively novel and powerful method of immunization DNA vaccination is a powerful method of immunization that induces strong cellular immune responses {{to a wide range of}} pathogens in many animal models for different diseases (Donnelly et al., 1997). Previous reports demonstrated that intramuscular inoculation with a DNA vaccine that coded for L 7 /L 12 elicited a strong protective response (Ercan and Splitter, 1997). As described previously, viable B. abortus RB 51 conferred over 2 log units of protection (Tabatabai and Pugh, 1994). Munoz-Montesino et al. (2004) concluded that intra-spleen delivery of a DNA vaccine containing the Cu/Zn SOD was able to generate a protective immunity but intramuscular administration of that vaccine in the same doses and under the same conditions as the subcutaneous inoculation did not lead to a significant protective immune response (Onate et al., 2003). Those results demonstrated a higher efficacy of the subcutaneous route of administration and they were in agreement with the results obtained by Cano et al. (2001) and Maloy et al. (2001) ...|$|E
