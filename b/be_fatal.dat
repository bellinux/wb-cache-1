5|$|Chloroacetone turns brown-orange {{when exposed}} to light, while ethyl bromoacetate is a yellow liquid at {{tropical}} outdoor temperatures. Both have similar colors to the liquid used on the demonstrators. Some varieties of French tear gas contained phosgene oxime or hydrogen cyanide. These two chemicals can <b>be</b> <b>fatal,</b> {{but none of the}} protestors in this incident died.|$|E
25|$|The {{paralysis}} {{caused by}} botulism can persist for 2 to 8 weeks, during which supportive care and ventilation {{may be necessary}} to keep the person alive. Botulism <b>is</b> <b>fatal</b> in 5% to 10% of people who are affected. However, if left untreated, botulism <b>is</b> <b>fatal</b> in 40% to 50% of cases.|$|R

5|$|Contaminated {{breathing}} gas {{at depth}} can <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b> Concentrations which are acceptable {{at the surface}} ambient pressure will be increased by the pressure of depth and may then exceed acceptable or tolerable limits. Common contaminants are: carbon monoxide - a by-product of combustion, carbon dioxide - a product of metabolism, and oil and lubricants from the compressor.|$|E
5|$|Hypokalemia, a {{deficiency}} of potassium in the plasma, can <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> if severe. Common causes are increased gastrintestinal loss (vomiting, diarrhea), and increased renal loss (diuresis). Deficiency symptoms include muscle weakness, paralytic ileus, ECG abnormalities, decreased reflex response; and in severe cases, respiratory paralysis, alkalosis, and cardiac arrhythmia.|$|E
5|$|Other common {{household}} {{substances that}} should be used with caution around cats include mothballs and other naphthalene products. Phenol-based products (e.g. Pine-Sol, Dettol/Lysol or hexachlorophene) are often used for cleaning and disinfecting near cats' feeding areas or litter boxes, but these can sometimes <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b> Ethylene glycol, often used as an automotive antifreeze, is particularly appealing to cats, and {{as little as a}} teaspoonful can <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b> Some human foods are toxic to cats; for example chocolate can cause theobromine poisoning, although (unlike dogs) few cats will eat chocolate. Large amounts of onions or garlic are also poisonous to cats. Many houseplants are also dangerous, such as Philodendron species and the leaves of the Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum), which can cause permanent and life-threatening kidney damage.|$|E

5|$|Soluble {{dysprosium}} salts, such as dysprosium chloride and dysprosium nitrate, are mildly toxic when ingested. Based on {{the toxicity}} of dysprosium chloride to mice, {{it is estimated}} that the ingestion of 500grams or more could <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> to a human. The insoluble salts, however, are non-toxic.|$|E
5|$|Suit {{inflation}} gas may {{be carried}} in a small independent cylinder. Sometimes argon is used for superior insulation properties. This must be clearly labelled and may {{also need to be}} colour coded to avoid inadvertent use as a breathing gas, which could <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> as argon is an asphyxiant.|$|E
5|$|The {{most serious}} {{potential}} adverse effect of biguanide use is metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA). Though the incidence for MALA about nine per 100,000 person-years, {{this is not}} different from the background incidence of lactic acidosis in the general population. A systematic review concluded no data exists to definitively link metformin to lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis can <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b>|$|E

5|$|A.phalloides {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{poisonous}} of all known toadstools. It is estimated that as little as half a mushroom contains enough toxin to kill an adult human. It has been involved in the majority of human deaths from mushroom poisoning, possibly including the deaths of Roman Emperor Claudius in AD 54 and Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740. It has been the subject of much research, and many of its biologically active agents have been isolated. The principal toxic constituent is Î±-amanitin, which damages the liver and kidneys, causing hepatic and renal failure that can <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{with similar}} {{substances}} with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, withdrawal from alcohol dependence can <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> {{if it is}} not properly managed. Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the GABAA receptor, promoting central nervous system depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in tolerance and physical dependence. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life-threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure. Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially dopamine, NMDA and glutamate.|$|E
5|$|Biological, clinical, and {{demographic}} {{factors contribute to}} the likelihood that an injury will <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b> In addition, outcome depends heavily on the cause of head injury. In the US, patients with fall-related TBIs have an 89% survival rate, while only 9% of patients with firearm-related TBIs survive. In the US, firearms {{are the most common}} cause of fatal TBI, followed by vehicle accidents and then falls. Of deaths from firearms, 75% are considered to be suicides.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine is {{detectable}} with {{measuring devices}} in concentrations {{as low as}} 0.2 parts per million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60ppm. About 1000ppm can <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> after a few deep breaths of the gas. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) concentration is 10 ppm. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes. The toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations greater than 30ppm, it reacts with water and cellular fluid, producing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HClO).|$|E
5|$|Foreign bodies, {{especially}} {{small pieces}} of hay or straw, can become lodged {{in the eyes of}} guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer. Hay or straw dust can also cause sneezing. While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the US Mint began minting pennies {{coated in}} copper but {{containing}} primarily zinc. The new zinc pennies pose {{a risk of}} zinc toxicosis, which can <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b> One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis. Another patient who ingested 12grams of zinc showed only lethargy and ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements). Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins.|$|E

5|$|Pennies {{and other}} small coins are {{sometimes}} ingested by dogs, requiring veterinary removal of the foreign objects. The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, commonly fatal in dogs through severe hemolytic anemia and liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms. Zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b> The consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the tight}} control of enzyme {{activity}} {{is essential for}} homeostasis, any malfunction (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single critical enzyme {{can lead to a}} genetic disease. The malfunction of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in the human body can <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b> An example of a fatal genetic disease due to enzyme insufficiency is Tay-Sachs disease, in which patients lack the enzyme hexosaminidase.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have {{an unusually}} low basal {{metabolic}} rate, about 40% {{of the typical}} value for placental mammals of their size, {{comparable to that of}} sloths. Since they consume a relatively high-calorie diet that is available year-round, it has been proposed that this slow metabolism is due primarily to the need to eliminate toxic compounds from their food. For example, slow lorises can feed on Gluta bark, which may <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> to humans.|$|E
