25|$|According to a cosmogonical story {{preserved}} in the Vendidad, not long after Ahura Mazda had created the world, Angra Mainyu unleashed innumerable sicknesses upon it. In response, Ahura Mazda requested Manthra Spenta, Sraosha and Airyaman to find a cures for them, promising each that he would reward them and <b>bless</b> <b>them</b> with Dahma Afriti. With Airyaman's assistance, Ahura Mazda then brought 10,000 plants to the earth, so providing Thraetaona with the means to cure the world of all ills (Vendidad 22.5).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these festivals, ceremonies marking rites of passage are also performed within the shrines. Two such ceremonies are {{the birth of a}} child and the Shichi-Go-San. When a child is born they are brought to a shrine so that they can be initiated as a new believer and the kami can <b>bless</b> <b>them</b> and their future life. The Shichi-Go-San (the Seven-Five-Three) is a rite of passage for five-year-old boys and three- or seven-year-old girls. It is a time for these young children to personally offer thanks for the kami’s protection and to pray for continued health.|$|E
25|$|House Blessings: On Theophany {{the priest}} will begin making {{the round of}} the parishioner's homes to <b>bless</b> <b>them.</b> He will perform a short prayer service in each home, and then go through the entire house, gardens and outside-buildings, blessing them with the newly blessed Theophany Water, while all sing the Troparion and Kontakion of the feast. This is {{normally}} done on Theophany, or at least during the Afterfeast, but if the parishioners are numerous, and especially if many live {{far away from the}} church, it may take some time to bless each house. Traditionally, these blessings should all be finished before the beginning of Great Lent).|$|E

25|$|The cult of {{the mother}} goddess is treated as an {{indication}} of a society which venerated femininity. This mother goddess was conceived as a virgin, one who has given birth to all and one, typically associated with Shaktism. The temples of the Sangam days, mainly of Madurai, seem to have had priestesses to the deity, which also appear predominantly a goddess. In the Sangam literature, there is an elaborate description of the rites performed by the Kurava priestess in the shrine Palamutircholai. Among the early Dravidians the practice of erecting memorial stones “Natukal or Hero Stone had appeared, and it continued {{for quite a long time}} after the Sangam age, down to about 16th century. It was customary for people who sought victory in war to worship these hero stones to <b>bless</b> <b>them</b> with victory.|$|E
25|$|In Romania and Moldova, Epiphany, {{is called}} Boboteaza. In {{south-eastern}} Romania, following religious services, men participate in winter horse races. Before the race, the men {{line up with}} their horses before the priest, who will <b>bless</b> <b>them</b> by sprinkling them with green branches that have been dipped into Epiphany holy water. Sometimes people desire to have this blessing for themselves as well. Winning the Epiphany race is a great honor for both horse and rider, while the post-race celebrations, win or not, are highly festive. As in other Orthodox heritage countries, water rites play a special role on this day. A unique piece of Romanian folk wisdom holds that if a girl slips on ice – or better yet falls into water- on Epiphany, she will surely marry before the year is out.|$|E
25|$|Terah, {{the ninth}} in descent from Noah, {{was the father}} of three sons: Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran {{was the father of}} Lot (who was thus Abram's nephew), and died in his native city, Ur of the Chaldees. Abram married Sarah (Sarai), who was barren. Terah, with Abram, Sarai, and Lot, then {{departed}} for Canaan, but settled in a place named Haran, where Terah {{died at the age of}} 205. God had told Abram to leave his country and kindred and go to a land that he would show him, and promised to make of him a great nation, bless him, make his name great, <b>bless</b> <b>them</b> that bless him, and curse them who may curse him. Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran with his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and the substance and souls that they had acquired, and traveled to Shechem in Canaan.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the precise}} {{form of the}} {{original}} holiday cannot be known with certainty and its traditions have evolved over time, 18th- and 19th-century accounts {{provide insight into the}} festival as it was practiced at that time. Accounts from these centuries indicate that all family members were required to reunite in their home villages during the festival period. Estranged family members were expected to attempt to reconcile. Homes were cleaned and repaired and new housewares and clothing were purchased. The symbolism of renewal was particularly embodied in the traditional sexual permissiveness encouraged {{on the eve of the}} fandroana (characterized by early 19th-century British missionaries as an [...] "orgy") and the following morning's return to rigid social order with the sovereign firmly at the helm of the kingdom. On this morning, the first day of the year, a red rooster was traditionally sacrificed and its blood used to anoint the sovereign and others present at the ceremony. Afterward the sovereign would bathe in sanctified water, then sprinkle it upon attendees to purify and <b>bless</b> <b>them</b> and ensure an auspicious start to the year. Children would celebrate the fandroana by carrying lighted torches and lanterns in a nighttime processional through their villages. The zebu meat eaten over the course of the festival was primarily grilled or consumed as jaka, a preparation reserved uniquely for this holiday. This delicacy was made during the festival by sealing shredded zebu meat with suet in a decorative clay jar. The confit would then be conserved in an underground pit for twelve months to be served at the next year's fandroana.|$|E
