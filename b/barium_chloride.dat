Different synthetic approaches yield nanocrystalline materials {{as well as}} large single crystals. The crystalline phases identified so far are BaFCl, Ba 12 F 19 Cl 5 and Ba 7 F 12 Cl 2 (in two modifications) and compared with analogous compounds. It is demonstrated that the compound Ba 2 F 3 Cl reported by Fessenden and Lewin 50 years ago corresponds to Ba 7 F 12 Cl 2. The phase diagram of the BaCl 2 – BaF 2 system is reinvestigated for fluoride mole fractions between 0. 5 and 1. The peritectic formation of Ba 12 F 19 Cl 5 is observed. Periodic DFT calculations are performed for all structures in this system, including a hypothetical structure for Ba 2 F 3 Cl, based on the experimental structure of Ba 2 H 3 Cl. The energy of formation of the different <b>barium</b> fluoride <b>chloride</b> compounds from BaCl 2 and BaF 2 (normalized for one barium atom per formula unit), as calculated by DFT at 0 K, is within only about ± 15 kJ/mol.

Bath sodium removal led to a bicarbonate-independent, 4 -acetamido- 4 ′-isothiocyanatostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulfonic acid insensitive acidification. The recovery of this acidification was ethylisopropyl amiloride sensitive, suggestive of basolateral sodium:hydrogen exchange. Whereas bath chloride removal led to a small acidification this was not 4 -acetamido- 4 ′-isothiocyanatostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulfonic acid sensitive and its causes remain unclear.

Currently the government plans to utilize the Disi aquifer, which can provide 90 million m 3 of water for the next 100 years. Given the importance of this aquifer it is important to assess its quality. In this master’s project we analyze the Disi aquifer’s radium content and explore the implications from these findings. Specifically 22 samples from the aquifer were collected and compared to 38 samples from the rest of Jordan. The samples were analyzed both in terms of the chemical make up as well as their Ra content. Further analysis involved GIS mapping and some basic statistic. Finally work was done to assess the impact of our findings the nation’s water management plan.

So far, only {{a number of}} experiments {{have been carried out}} for the remediation of bottom-ash from municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerator. The electrokinetic extraction of heavy metals from ashes is limited by the high buffer capacity of the latter, especially when in alkaline condition; on the other hand, a great extent of chloride migration was proven. Reducing soluble salts content in ash improves the environmental characteristics in view of recycling. Limitation of contaminant leaching requires the application of extra safety measures when bottom-ash from MSWI is used in (road) construction.

40|$|Reverse osmosis (RO) is a {{relatively}} new watertreatment process available to the householder. Although the technique is not new, the systems have become widely available only in the past few years. How Reverse Osmosis Works In RO systems, water is forced through a small-pore membrane. Only water and other extremely small molecules fit through the holes in the mem-brane. Contaminants are caught {{on the face of the}} membrane. The simplest home RO system consists of a membrane, a storage container for the treated water, and a flow regulator for the reject water. The mem-branes must be chemical and bacteria resistant and are usually made of cellulose acetate or nylon. The pressure for RO is usually supplied by the line pres-sure of the water system in the home. Some RO sys-tems use a pump to force water through at high pres-sure. These systems are usually more effective than systems which use only the line pressure of the water system in the home. Since membranes are subject to degrading by chlorine, iron, manganese, and hydrogen sulfide and to bacterial attack, a sediment prefilter and an activat-ed carbon prefilter or postfilter might be included. The prefilter removes sand, silt, and sediments while the activated carbon removes the organic materials and dissolved gases not treated by the RO membrane. Water softeners are used in advance of the RO system when household water is excessively hard. Home RO units are often small, cylindrical devices approximately 5 inches in diameter and 10 - to 25 -inches long, excluding any pre- or post-filtration apparatus. Often, the unit is placed beneath the kitchen sink to treat water used for cooking and drinking. Contaminants That Reverse Osmosis Treats Unlike other filtration methods, RO can reduce the concentrations of most of the major classes of common contaminants found in water.

The current activated when the membrane was depolarized above - 50 mV. The sigmoidally rising current rose to a peak {{at a rate that}} increased with depolarization. Inactivation proceeded exponentially with a time constant of approximately equal to 450 ms. Recovery from inactivation was slow (tau = 12 s).

The heat released and the quantity of adsorbed water were found to depend on various parameters such as the amount of accessible salt, the dispersion of the salt on the surface and/or into the porous matrix, and the hydration level of the deposited salt hydrates. The TG-DSC results revealed that the heat released per gram of material increases with the amount of calcium chloride and lithium nitrate, while it remains nearly constant with the barium hydroxide loading. Due to its high heat of water sorption and low cost, the composite containing 15 wt% of calcium chloride (738 kJ kg(sample) (- 1)) appears to be the most promising compared to lithium nitrate or barium hydroxide composites (609 and 408 kJ kg(sample) (- 1) respectively).

We investigated the potential of Biodritin, a novel polymer constituted of alginate and chondroitin sulfate, for islet microencapsulation. Methods. Biodritin microcapsules were obtained using an air jet droplet generator and gelated with <b>barium</b> or calcium <b>chloride.</b> Microencapsulated rat insulinoma RINm 5 F cells were tested for viability using the [3 -(4, 5 -dimetyl-thiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl-tetrazoliumbromide] [MTT] colorimetric assay. Microencapsulated rat pancreatic islets were coincubated with macrophages derived from mouse peritoneal liquid to assess the immunomodulatory potential of the microcapsules, using quantitative real time-PCR (qPCR). Biodritin biocompatibility was demonstrated by subcutaneous injection of empty microcapsules into immunocompetent Wistar rats. Insulin secretion by microencapsulated human pancreatic islets was evaluated using an electrochemoluminescent assay. Microencapsulated human islets transplanted into chemically induced diabetic mice were monitored for reversal of hyperglycemia. Results. The metabolic activity of microencapsulated RINm 5 F cells persisted for at least 15 days. Interleukin- 1 beta expression by macrophages was observed during coculture with islets microencapsulated with Biodritin-CaCl 2, but not with Biodritin-BaCl 2. No statistical difference in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was observed between nonencapsulated and microencapsulated islets. Upon microencapsulated islet transplantation, the blood glucose level of diabetic mice normalized; they remained euglycemic for at least 60 days, displaying normal oral glucose tolerance tests. Conclusion. This study demonstrated that Biodritin can be used for islet microencapsulation and reversal of diabetes; however, further investigations are required to assess its potential for long-term transplantation...|$|R
