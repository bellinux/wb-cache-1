The principal raw materials used in producing <b>baker.</b> <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> are the pure yeast culture and molasses. Cane molasses and beet molasses contain 45 to 55 % sugar in the forms of sucrose, glucose, and fructose. Molasses, which is a rich carbon and mineral source, contains most of the nutrients and minerals required for <b>baker.</b> <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> production. Nutrients and trace elements (magnesium, copper and zinc) that are not present in sufficient quantities in molasesses {{are added to the}} fermentation medium. In this study, the effects of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + on <b>baker.</b> <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> production were investigated. The method of Food Composition Laboratory (FCL), Human Nutrition Research Center, Beltsville, US, was used for the preparation of the fermentation samples prior to ICP-AES analysis. The concentrations of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Cu 2 +, Zn 2 + were determined in the raw materials entering the fermentors and the products. FCL digestion method was evaluated on precision and accuracy; linear standard curves were obtained for the studied concentration ranges of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Cu 2 + and Zn 2 +. Standard addition curves for each element in 45 brix molasses and dry yeast samples were constructed and spike recovery percentages were calculated. High spike recovery percentages were obtained for all elements in both dry yeast and molasses with the FCL method. In industrial fermentations, uptakes of Ca 2 +, Cu 2 +, Mg 2 + and Zn 2 + by the yeast cells were calculated as mg/kg dry yeast at 4 h time intervals. The uptake rates were evaluated based on the available element concentration in the medium and the uptake of the elements. Results showed that, as the uptake of Ca 2 + increased with time, uptake of Mg 2 +, Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + decreased. The yeast cells used the available elements with decreasing uptake rates except Ca 2 +. During the first hours of fermentation, uptake rates were high. The maximum uptake rates observed for each element in two different industrial fermentations were: 17. 73 - 23. 32 mg Cu 2 +/ kg dry yeast cells, 195. 64 - 413. 46 mg Zn 2 + / kg dry yeast cells, 2106. 46 - 2051. 74 mg Mg 2 + / kg dry yeast cells. Ion concentrations of biomass in industrial fermentations revealed that same amounts of Mg were taken by the cell from the fermentation medium under similar conditions. This was verified by the studies done in lab-scale using pure culture of S. cerevisiae, grown on different concentrations of Mg 2 +. It was found that uptake of Mg 2 + was constant and very close to the uptake values of industrial fermentations. 806. 7 mM Mg 2 + was taken by 1 kg of dry yeast cells. This is in agreement with the stated Mg 2 + uptake concentration range 500 - 1000 mM of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in literature. In the industry, magnesium is added in the form of Mg. SO 4. 7 H 2 O to the fermentation medium. SO 42 - ions coming from the MgSO 4. 7 H 2 O cause settling problems in the waste treatment system of the plant. Generally, molasses contain sufficient concentration of Mg 2 + ions required for <b>baker.</b> <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> production in the industrial scale. Since Mg 2 + has toxic effects at high concentrations and its addition is increasing the cost of the process and causing difficulties in the waste treatment of the plant, it may be concluded that addition of Mg 2 + as MgSO 4. 7 H 2 O to the fermentation medium should be done after determining the Mg 2 + concentration of molasses. Instead of using excessive amounts of MgSO 4. 7 H 2 O, only the required quantity should be added to the fermentation medium...|$|E
40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{commonly}} known as <b>Baker</b> <b>s</b> <b>yeast,</b> is a eukaryotic model organism widely used in biotechnology research. Its genome has {{a high degree of}} similarity to humans, and research done on S. cerevisiae can give us {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms involved and the cellular responses to anti-cancer drugs. Yeast is therefore usefool in increasing the effectiveness of anti-cancer drugs. The main goal for this master thesis was to investigate the metabolic response of S. cerevisiae to DNA damaging compounds. Methods for cultivation of S. cerevisiae in shake flasks or in a bioreactor, for sampling and extraction of cells, and for analysis of the sample using GC MS were developed. A custom Deconvolution Reporting Software library was created, and used to analyze the metabolic response of S. cerevisiae to 5 -fluoruracil (5 FU), a widely used anti-cancer drugs. The publicly available software FiatFlux 1. 6 X was used for metabolic flux analysis of S. cerevisiae grown in medium containing labeled [U- 13 C]-glucose and in the presence of 5 -fluorouracil or methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), a model alkylating agent. An overall decrease in the amount of intracellular metabolites was observed as a response to addition of a growth-inhibiting dose of 5 FU, while no clear response was observed for a lower, more tolerable dose. Growth of S. cerevisiae under the presence of 5 FU resulted in a different cellular response than growth under the presence of MMS. The presence of both DNA-damaging agents resulted in a decrease in the ratio of the fluxes leading to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA compared to an unstressed culture, possibly indicating a reduction in the activity of the TCA cycle. The 5 FU stressed cells showed an increase in conversion of fumarate to oxaloacetate and the subsequent export out of the mitochondrion, while the MMS stressed cells showed a decrease of this flux. The experimental methods can be further refined to obtain data of higher quality, and thus allow a more complete metabolic profile to be created. The conditions for derivatization can be optimized to ensure a complete derivatization of all metabolites, the DRS library can be expanded to include a wider range of metabolites, and experiments of stressing the cells performed in a chemostat can eliminate any effects the differences in specific growth rates might have on the metabolome or fluxome of S. cerevisiae...|$|E

Also, most transformation protocols {{have been developed}} for <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast,</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae, and thus may not be optimal for other species. Even within one species, different strains have different transformation efficiencies, sometimes different by three orders of magnitude. For instance, when S. cerevisiae strains were transformed with 10ug of plasmid YEp13, the strain DKD-5D-H yielded between 550 and 3115 colonies while strain OS1 yielded fewer than five colonies.|$|R

Commercial <b>baker’s</b> <b>yeast</b> (<b>S.</b> cerevisiae) and a local isolate of A. niger were used for the fermentation process to generate crude protein. The effect of supplementation by various inorganic sources of nitrogen on the crude protein yields was compared. Ammonium sulphate [(NH 4) 2 SO 4], one of the inorganic nitrogen source used, supported the highest crude protein yields of 16. 78 % and 21. 30 % respectively for A. niger and S. cerevisiae while the lowest yield of 13. 92 % and 18. 00 % were supported by potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate respectively...|$|R
30|$|Briefly as {{described}} previously (Yegutkin et al. 2003), 10 µL aliquots of EDTA plasma were transferred into two parallel wells {{of a white}} non-phosphorescent 96 -well microplate containing 100 µL of PBS with (A) or without (B) a solution of 200  µM UTP and 5 U/mL NDP kinase from <b>baker’s</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae (Sigma). Following the addition of 50 µL of ATP-monitoring reagent, sample luminescence was measured using a Tecan Infinite M 200 microplate reader (Salzburg, Austria). The difference in luminescence signals between well “A” (ATP + ADP) and “B” (only ATP) enabled the quantification of ADP concentration, which was converted into ATP through an NDP kinase-mediated reaction {{in the presence of}} exogenous UTP. This approach allows simultaneous measurement of both ATP and ADP content within the same sample.|$|R

After liquefaction, the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation was conducted in a jar fermentor. Amyloglucosidase was used for saccharification, and dry <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast,</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae, for fermentation simultaneously. Glucose was consumed promptly in both cases, LG 1 and LG 2; ethanol production was considerably higher in LG 1 (38. 6 g/L), compared to LG 2 (24. 9 g/L).

The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T 2 values were calculated for both. An {{attempt was made to}} explain the signal behaviour in the yeast samples by using biophysical models. Additionally, across the range of echo times (TE) explored, ADC varied. Conversely, across the range of b-values explored, the value of T 2 varied. These results suggest some dependence of ADC on TE and T 2 on b-value. A slight change in ADC was detected when only varying the diffusion time in the experiment...|$|R
40|$|Mentor: Heidi SleisterErrors in the {{eukaryotic}} cell cycle and processes that maintain genome stability {{can result in}} abnormal chromosome number and structure (e. g., in humans- Down Syndrome, cancer). The common <b>baker’s</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae is a great model system {{for the analysis of}} chromosome transmission as yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) can be lost or rearranged without harming the cell. In an effort to identify proteins important for chromosome transmission, yeast mutants that display increased loss of a YAC during cell division were generated. Suppressor analysis resulted in the isolation of both single and high copy yeast genomic plasmids that improve the chromosome loss defect in these mutants. Subsequent analysis revealed multiple candidate genes present within the suppressor plasmids. Each gene is being individually cloned and assayed for suppression of chromosome loss.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{development}} of large-scale kinetic models {{is one of}} the current key issues in computational systems biology and bioinformatics. Here we consider the problem of parameter estimation in nonlinear dynamic models. Global optimization methods can be used to solve this type of problems but the associated computational cost is very large. Moreover, many of these methods need the tuning of a number of adjustable search parameters, requiring a number of initial exploratory runs and therefore further increasing the computation times. Here we present a novel parallel method, self-adaptive cooperative enhanced scatter search (saCeSS), to accelerate the solution of this class of problems. The method is based on the scatter search optimization metaheuristic and incorporates several key new mechanisms: (i) asynchronous cooperation between parallel processes, (ii) coarse and fine-grained parallelism, and (iii) self-tuning strategies. Results The performance and robustness of saCeSS is illustrated by solving a set of challenging parameter estimation problems, including medium and large-scale kinetic models of the bacterium E. coli, <b>baker</b> 9 <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae, the vinegar fly D. melanogaster, Chinese Hamster Ovary cells, and a generic signal transduction network. The results consistently show that saCeSS is a robust and efficient method, allowing very significant reduction of computation times with respect to several previous state of the art methods (from days to minutes, in several cases) even when {{only a small number of}} processors is used. Conclusions The new parallel cooperative method presented here allows the solution of medium and large scale parameter estimation problems in reasonable computation times and with small hardware requirements. Further, the method includes self-tuning mechanisms which facilitate its use by non-experts. We believe that this new method can play a key role in the {{development of}} large-scale and even whole-cell dynamic models...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the traditions}} and skills of total synthesis, the {{chemical}} mimicry and targeting {{of the primary}} components of cells is gaining significant success {{in our understanding of}} diseases. Today, for example, the synthesis of exactly connected and stereochemically defined lipidated and glycan conjugates can be achieved to provide pure homogeneic materials for biological study. This is particularly important since closely related bioconjugated structures exist within cells and, within that dynamic cellular milieu, the unambiguous assignment of a molecular entity to a particular function (either singly or as a multivalent assembly) is an important goal to achieve. In our modest contributions to the field, we are exploring glycolipid tools to analyze infection, generate antibodies, and identify enzymes. In this talk, we shall highlight two projects: (1) the development of more specific variants of Orlistat (tetrahydrolipstatin, THL) to target the lipogenic activity of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and (2) the metabolic incorporation of an azido-myo-inositol into the phosphatidylinositols (PIs) of <b>Baker’s</b> <b>yeast</b> (<b>S.</b> cerevisiae) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{complete}} genome of the <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae {{was analyzed}} {{for the presence}} of polypurine/polypyrimidine (poly[pu/py]) repeats and their occurrences were classified {{on the basis of their}} location within and outside open reading frames (ORFs). The analysis reveals that such sequence motifs are present abundantly both in coding as well as noncoding regions. Clear positional preferences are seen when these tracts occur in noncoding regions. These motifs appear to occur predominantly at a unit nucleosomal length both upstream and downstream of ORFs. Moreover, there is a biased distribution of polypurines in the coding strands when these motifs occur within open reading frames. The significance of the biased distribution is discussed with reference to the occurrence of these motifs in other known mRNA sequences and expressed sequence tags. A model for cis regulation of gene expression is proposed based on the ability of these motifs to form an intermolecular triple helix structure when present within the coding region and/or to modulate nucleosome positioning via enhanced histone affinity when present outside coding regions...|$|R

40|$|Psoriasis and {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) are chronic inflammatory diseases sharing similar pathogenic pathways. Intestinal microbial changes such as {{a decrease}} of bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{have been reported in}} IBD, suggesting the presence of a gut-skin axis. To investigate whether the S. cerevisiae abundance was altered in psoriasis patients versus healthy controls, and whether dimethylfumarate (DMF) interacted with this yeast. Using qPCR, faecal samples were compared between psoriasis patients without DMF (n = 30), psoriasis patients with DMF (n = 28), and healthy controls (n = 32). Faecal S. cerevisiae abundance was decreased in psoriasis compared to healthy controls (p< 0. 001). Interestingly, DMF use raised S. cerevisiae levels (p< 0. 001). Gastrointestinal adverse-effects of DMF were correlated with a higher S. cerevisiae abundance (p = 0. 010). In vitro, a direct effect of DMF on S. cerevisiae growth was observed. In addition, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies were not elevated in psoriasis. The abundance of <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae is decreased in psoriasis patients, but appears to be restored upon DMF use. S. cerevisiae is generally classified as a yeast with beneficial immunomodulatory properties, but may also be involved in the occurrence of DMF's gastrointestinal adverse-effects.

40|$|Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Torulaspora delbrueckii {{isolated}} from traditional bread doughs displayed dough-raising capacities {{similar to the}} ones found in baker’s yeasts. During storage of frozen doughs, strains of T. delbrueckii (IGC 5321, IGC 5323, and IGC 4478) presented approximately the same leavening ability for 30 days. Cell viability was not significantly affected by freezing, but when the dough was submitted to a bulk fermentation before being stored at 220 &C, there was a decrease in the survival ratio which depended on the yeast strain. Furthermore, the leavening ability after 4 days of storage decreased as the prefermentation period of the dough before freezing increased, except for strains IGC 5321 and IGC 5323. These two strains retained their fermentative activity after 15 days of storage and 2. 5 h of prefermentation, despite showing a reduction of viable cells under the same conditions. The intracellular trehalose content was higher than 20 % (wt/wt) in four of the yeasts tested: the two commercial strains of <b>baker’s</b> <b>yeast</b> (<b>S.</b> cerevisiae IGC 5325 and IGC 5326) and the two mentioned strains of T. delbrueckii (IGC 5321 and IGC 5323).

40|$|Selenium, {{recognized}} as an essential nutrient for human health, is a component of proteins and enzymes required for various bio-logical functions and is currently {{being used as a}} feed supplement for livestock in geographical areas that are naturally low in sele-nium. Selenium is structurally similar to sulfur, replacing the sulfur atom in stoichiometric amounts and thus functions through an as-sociation with proteins, termed selenoproteins. In geographic areas low in selenium, there is the potential for animals (including hu-mans) to become selenium deficient and this potential deficiency can be remedied by consumption of exogenous selenium, including selenium-enriched yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that contains high levels of organic selenium (e. g., selenized yeast).

40|$|Since the {{completion}} of the genome sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 1996 (refs 1, 2), there has been a large increase in complete genome sequences, accompanied by great advances in our understanding of genome evolution. Although {{little is known about the}} natural and life histories of yeasts in the wild, there are an increasing number of studies looking at ecological and geographic distributions, population structure and sexual versus asexual reproduction. Less well understood at the whole genome level are the evolutionary processes acting within populations and species that lead to adaptation to different environments, phenotypic differences and reproductive isolation. Here we present one- to fourfold or more coverage of the genome sequences of over seventy isolates of the <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae and its closest relative, Saccharomyces paradoxus. We examine variation in gene content, single nucleotide polymorphisms, nucleotide insertions and deletions, copy numbers and transposable elements. We find that phenotypic variation broadly correlates with global genome-wide phylogenetic relationships. S. paradoxus populations are well delineated along geographic boundaries, whereas the variation among worldwide S. cerevisiae isolates shows less differentiation and is comparable to a single S. paradoxus population. Rather than one or two domestication events leading to the extant baker's yeasts, the population structure of S. cerevisiae consists of a few well-defined, geographically isolated lineages and many different mosaics of these lineages, supporting the idea that human influence provided the opportunity for cross-breeding and production of new combinations of pre-existing variations.

Experimental and control strains were mated with the Yeast Knockout Collection using Synthetic Genetic Array technology, and pools of deletion mutants expressing the construct were then treated with 55 serotonin uptake inhibitor and α 2 -adrenoceptor drugs to quantitatively measure receptor response via growth assays. Nine drug treatments were then selected to determine their effects on pools of individual mutant strains – PCR barcodes were amplified from treated pools of the D 2 -expressing and empty vector cultures and hybridized to microar-rays. Gene set enrichment analysis of these data identified genes involved in mitotic progression as required for wild-type survival in (S) -MCPG; genes involved in phosphatidylinositol biosynthesis were required for survival in the presence of D 2.

40|$|Protein {{synthesis}} is {{a highly}} regulated and energy consuming process, during which a large ribonucleoprotein particle called the ribosome, synthesizes new proteins. The eukaryotic ribosome consists of two unequal subunits called: small and large subunits. Both subunits are composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal proteins (r-proteins). Although rRNAs build the matrix of the ribosome and carries out catalysing of the peptide-bond formation between amino acids, r-proteins also appear to play important structural and functional roles. The primary role of r-proteins is to initiate the correct tertiary fold of rRNA and to organize the overall structure of the ribosome. In this thesis, I focus on two proteins from the large subunit of the eukaryotic ribosome: r-proteins L 5 and L 15 from <b>bakers</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae. Both r-proteins are essential for ribosome function. Their life cycle is primarily associated with rRNA interactions. As a consequence, the proteins show high sequence homology across the species borders. Furthermore, both L 5 and L 15 are connected to human diseases, which makes the study their role in ribosome biogenesis and ribosome function important. By applying random- and site-directed mutagenesis, coupled with functional complementation tests, I aimed to elucidate functionally regions in both proteins, implicated in transport to the cell nucleus, protein-protein interactions and/or rRNA binding. The importance of individual and multiple amino acid exchanges in the primary sequence of rpL 5 and rpL 15 were studied in vivo. The obtained results show that S. cerevisiae rpL 15 was tolerant to amino acid exchanges in the primary sequence, whereas rpL 5 was not. Consequently, A. thaliana rpL 15 could substitute for the function of wild type rpL 15, whereas none of the tested orthologous proteins to rpL 5 could substitute yeast rpL 5 in vivo. These observations further {{emphasize the importance of}} studying r-proteins as separate entities in the ribosome context...|$|R
40|$|Nucleocytoplasmic {{transport}} {{is highly}} selective, efficient, and is regulated by a poorly understood mechanism involving hundreds of disordered FG nucleoporin proteins (FG nups) lining the inside {{wall of the}} nuclear pore complex (NPC). Previous research has concluded that FG nups in <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> (<b>S.</b> cerevisiae) are present in a bimodal distribution, with the "Forest Model" classifying FG nups as either di-block polymer like "trees" or single-block polymer like "shrubs". Using a combination of coarse-grained modeling and polymer brush modeling, {{the function of the}} di-block FG nups has previously been hypothesized in the Di-block Copolymer Brush Gate (DCBG) model to form a higher-order polymer brush architecture which can open and close to regulate transport across the NPC. In this manuscript we work to extend the original DCBG model by first performing coarse grained simulations of the single-block FG nups which confirm that they have a single block polymer structure rather than the di-block structure of tree nups. Our molecular simulations also demonstrate that these single-block FG nups are likely cohesive, compact, collapsed coil polymers, implying that these FG nups are generally localized to their grafting location within the NPC. We find that adding a layer of single-block FG nups to the DCBG model increases the range of cargo sizes which are able to translocate the pore through a cooperative effect involving single-block and di-block FG nups. This effect can explain the puzzling connection between single-block FG nup deletion mutants in S. cerevisiae and the resulting failure of certain large cargo transport through the NPC. Facilitation of large cargo transport via single-block and di-block FG nup cooperativity in the nuclear pore could provide a model mechanism for designing future biomimetic pores of greater applicability...|$|R

A retrospective Cr assessment study was conducted utilizing dietary records, urine, and blood serum from young adults and pregnant adolescents. Average daily Cr intakes for all subjects was 37. 0 (mu) g. Differences in chromium status were not demonstrated in subjects from different geographic locations. Pregnant adolescents had marginal Cr intakes (48 (mu) g/day) and non-detectable levels of Cr in urine. Pregnancy may divert maternal Cr stores to the fetus. ^ Nortestosterone-derived oral contraceptive agents have the greatest capacity to alter glucose tolerance in women. Retired breeding female mice were fed either an oral contraceptive preparation or a Cr supplement in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. All mice gained weight regardless of experimental treatment. In addition, treatments did not affect percentage carcass fat or moisture. Glucose tolerance tests were conducted. Chromium supplementation appeared to moderate the glucose response at 40 minutes post-glucose injection as compared to non-Cr supplementation. ^ Organic Cr {{as a component of}} the glucose tolerance factor found in brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> is considered to be the most biologically available form of Cr.

Each woman serving as her own control randomly received the basal diet alone, basal diet + brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast,</b> and basal diet + chelated Cr. Mean urinary Cr excretion was similar for subjects consuming the basal diet alone or with the brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> supplement (0. 16 (mu) g/day). However, the pattern of urinary excretion was different. Brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> supplementation decreased variability in Cr excretion in comparison to values when either the basal diet was fed alone or supplemented with chelated Cr. Chelated Cr led to significantly higher urinary Cr excretion (P 3 ̆c 0. 03) than did either the basal diet alone or with brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> supplementation. This suggests that either the Cr supplied by chelated Cr was better absorbed than was that supplied by yeast, although both were apparently poorly absorbed in comparison to the Cr supplied by the diet, or that the absorbed chelated Cr was more poorly utilized than was the Cr from yeast. Blood serum Cr concentrations were not significantly changed throughout the experimental treatments, although the numerically highest mean blood serum Cr level was found when the brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> was fed. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{feedback}} optimization {{scheme for}} a fed-batch fermentation was developed. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{commonly known as}} baker 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast,</b> was chosen as a model system. ^ As {{the first part of}} the proposed feedback optimization scheme, open-loop optimization studies have been carried out for the fed-batch baker 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> culture. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed feedback optimization scheme could handle the situations in which there are uncertainties in initial conditions and system parameters. The feedback optimization scheme could even overcome the changes in substrate feed concentration. ^ A fully computerized fed-batch fermentation system has been built. It consisted of a 15 L fermentor equipped with a local controller; to which a microcomputer, on-line cell density measurement devices, and a feeding system were interfaced. A fermentor offgas line was connected to a mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was also interfaced to the microcomputer for control and data acquisition. ^ The feedback optimization scheme has been implemented in low and high cell density fed-batch baker 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yeast</b> fermentations. The experimental results demonstrated the superiority of closed-loop implementation to the open-loop implementation for both low and high cell density runs. The performance indices in the closed-loop implementations were typically 10 - 20...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis demonstrates the application of electrochemical methods for probing the dynamics of cellular metabolism in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The {{main part of the}} work has been done using genetically modified strains of <b>yeast.</b> Employing <b>baker’s</b> <b>yeast,</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae, as a model organism, it was demonstrated how an amperometric method can be utilized for real-time in vivo screening of intracellular NAD(P) H availability in relation to redox enzyme activities. NAD(P) H availability was evaluated using the amperometric method based on a menadione-ferricyanide double-mediator system. Mediated amperometry is based on the ability of menadione, a lipophilic quinone, to freely diffuse through the plasma membrane and accept electrons from certain intracellular NAD(P) H-dependent enzymes. The reduced form of menadione is extracellularly oxidized by ferricyanide. The ferrocyanide formed is in turn oxidized at the gold microband electrode, giving rise to a bioelectrocatalytic current proportional to the activity of the menadione reducing enzyme. The bioelectrocatalytic current was measured by immobilizing living S. cerevisiae cells on gold microband electrode chips (Si/SiO 2 substrate) in Ca-alginate gel. The microelectrodes (width/length 25 / 1000 µm) were fabricated using micromachining technology for real-time amperometric probing of NAD(P) H-dependent redoxprocesses and pathways in living cells. The dependence of menadione-reducing enzyme activity on the main metabolic pathways was investigated by introducing different carbon sources (glucose and fructose). It was found that the amplitude of the yeast-catalysed amperometric signal was significantly higher when carbon sources were administered, primarily resulting in the formation of NAD(P) H through the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolytic pathway. The crucial effect of inhibitors on menadione-reducing activity was surveyed using the method. The results obtained during this work demonstrate the significance of enzyme activity determination in living cells as the source of information on cellular responses, reflecting different metabolic pathways and regulatory mechanisms. This gives further support to the potential of mediated amperometry as a tool in metabolic profiling...|$|R
