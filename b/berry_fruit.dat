2500|$|The {{characteristic}} {{notes of}} Grenache are <b>berry</b> <b>fruit</b> such as raspberries and strawberries. When yields {{are kept in}} check, Grenache-based wines can develop complex and intense notes of blackcurrants, black cherries, black olives, coffee, gingerbread, honey, leather, black pepper, tar, spices, and roasted nuts. When yields are increased, more overtly earthy and herbal notes emerge that tend to quickly fade on the palate. The very low-yielding old vines of Priorat can impart dark black fruits and notes of figs and tar with many traits similar to the Italian wine Amarone. Rosado or rosé Grenaches are often characterized by their strawberry and cream notes while fortified vin doux nautrels and Australian [...] "port style" [...] wines exhibits coffee and nutty tawny-like notes.|$|E

40|$|<b>Berry</b> <b>fruits</b> contain {{high levels}} of {{different}} phytochemicals, {{most of which are}} phenolic molecules. Fruits of the same cultivar from different locations and different harvest years have different chemical compositions, particularly related to polyphenols. The difference may be due to specific climatic conditions, the type of soil in which the plants grow, and the stresses to which the plants were subjected because these phytochemicals are produced as a defense mechanism through a secondary metabolic process. For this reason, it is important to establish simple and reliable procedure to determine polyphenolic compounds in <b>berry</b> <b>fruits</b> considering the increasing attention on these compounds for different potential uses. In order to choose and to improve the most adequate analytical procedure for the determination of the polyphenolic substances in <b>berry</b> <b>fruits,</b> different methods were applied and compared on samples of elderberry and blackberry...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Numerous {{epidemiological}} {{studies have shown}} that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, such as <b>berry</b> <b>fruits,</b> reduces the risk of many chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the nutraceutical proprieties of wild and cultivated blackberry (Rubus sp.) and wild elderberry (Sambuca nigra) fruits produced in some regions of Southern Italy, such as Basilicata and Campania. METHODS: Liquid chromatography and HPLC-UV system were used for the identification and quantification of individual health-promoting compounds. RESULTS: A comparative analysis of nutraceutical compounds in <b>berry</b> <b>fruits</b> produced by different regions of South Italy showed a high significant variability inter species (P< 0. 05), independently on location area, with higher values for wild than cultivated blackberries for the major part of compounds.
