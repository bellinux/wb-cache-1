40|$|Cathodic {{protection}} {{has been}} proven {{to be one of}} the most widely applicable and cost-effective solutions for tackling steel corrosion in reinforced concrete. In this study, the possible use of carbon fibre composites, which are primarily used to strengthen concrete members, has been investigated as impressed current cathodic protection anodes. Carbon fibre anodes have been assessed in both concrete and calcium hydroxide solution. Two bonding mediums incorporating epoxy and geopolymer have also been investigated. The results demonstrate that epoxy resin can be used for <b>bonding</b> carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>fabric</b> anodes to reinforced concrete structures while geopolymer is more effective for <b>bonding</b> carbon <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer (CFRP) rod into preformed grooves in the concrete surface. The dissolution of carbon fibre anode appears to stablise after a period of time, dependent upon the size and shape of the anode and applied voltage and current. Based on the present results, a maximum current density of 128 [*]mA/m 2 of reinforcing steel area is recommended for the operation of CFRP fabric anode and 64 [*]mA/m 2 of reinforcing steel area for that of CFRP rod anode...|$|R
30|$|The {{introduction}} of composite materials {{which has been}} used for 35  years in the field of Civil Engineering allows other techniques of strengthening of reinforced concrete structures by <b>bonding</b> composite carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>fabrics</b> Ivanova [1]. However, the short reinforced concrete corbel is an important structural element to support the pre-cast structural system, such as pre-cast beam and pre-stressed beam. Most of the structures in Civil Engineering fit the current safety standards or have excessive cracks. Steel corrosion may also cause the occurrence of high deflection or instability of the structure itself. It is generally manifested by poor performance under service loading in the form of excessive deflections or cracking. The technique of strengthening compensates the loss of stiffness and cracking development. In fact, this technique improves the performance and durability of the structures.|$|R

Additional value to plywood materials can be added by incorporating it into laminates with specific properties as enhanced crashworthiness, sound/vibration absorption, heat transfer insulation and electromagnetic shield properties. This work is related to increase plywood crashworthiness or impact properties. Therefore laminates have been made of one and three veneer birch plywood joined with thermoplastic polymer to different types of glass fibre and natural <b>fibre</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Incorporation of thermoplastic polymer with melting temperature close to plywood processing temperature allows unite plywood and laminates manufacturing. Also thermoplastic polymer increases vibration and impact absorption while <b>fibre</b> <b>fabric</b> materials enhance strength properties. In this research polyethylene is preferred as processing temperature of it is close to plywood, however for biodegradable composite polylactide is preferred. Implementation of natural <b>fibre</b> <b>fabrics</b> and biodegradable polymer is of interest making fully biodegradable composite, therefore exclude problems with materials accumulation in waste disposals. In this study experimental impact response evaluation of plywood/PE/fabric laminates has been performed using INSTRON 9250 HV drop-tower. Impact force and absorption energy is compared between plywood products (1, 3, 9 veneer plywood) and different configuration of layers and fabric types of plywood/thermoplastic polymer/fabric laminates.

Therefore, an experimental program was developed to evaluate the mechanical damaging effect on short corbels behaviour by using strain gauges. According to this program, five reinforced concrete corbels were tested under a three-point bending up to failure. Three of them were damaged at 45, 65 and 90  % of their ultimate load. After the specimens were repaired with carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>fabrics</b> and the loading was conducted till their failure. The fourth corbel which was not damaged. It was strengthened and tested until its collapse. The last one is the reference specimen corbel which was not reinforced. The test results with corbel specimens which were strengthened and unstrengthened are given. The significance to member performance is also explained. The measured load versus strain was too measured in the same way (with precision strain gauges) for others materials such as composite <b>fibre</b> <b>fabrics,</b> steel bar and concrete at the cross section of corbel. The study shows that the composite <b>fibre</b> <b>fabrics</b> using <b>bonding</b> technique could be a convenient and effective strengthening method for concrete structures. Thus, steel reinforcement and carbon fabrics played a major role in the repair of corbels.

Samples stored in normal climatic conditions can be characterized with capacitive/reactive resistance, ie. they have expressed dielectric properties but moist samples in lowfrequency range have ohmic/active resistance, ie. they have expressed electric conductivity properties that turn into dielectric properties in high-frequency range.

This paper {{illustrates}} investigations {{regarding the}} infiltration {{process of the}} thixotropic cast-alloy AlSi 7 Mg 0, 3 into laminated <b>fibre</b> woven <b>fabrics</b> by Fluid-Structure Interaction Analysis (FSI). As results of such FSI-Analysis {{on the one hand}} the kinematical behaviour of the reinforcement due to the infiltration process on the macroscopic and microscopic level on the other hand fluiddynamical effects of the regarded alloy are achieved. Thus in the run-up to timeconsuming and cost-intensive experiments, informative bases like fluidic optimizing of the cavity or the configuration and insertion of the reinforcement component can be numerically developed. Furthermore a reliable prediction of transient permeability of the <b>fibre</b> <b>fabric</b> is possible, which effects the infiltration process significantly. Numerical input data such as rheological parameters characterizing the behaviour of partial solidified alloys have been conducted. Therefor basic rheological tests of the aluminium cast-alloy AlSi 7 Mg 0, 3, like `HYSTERESIS TESTS´, `SHEAR RATE JUMP TESTS ´ and detection of `STATIC ´ and `DYNAMIC YIELD POINTS ´ and the `DIFFERENTIAL STRUCTURAL PARAMETER ´ have been conducted.
