50|$|High lead logging is {{a method}} of cable logging using a spar, yarder and loader. It was {{developed}} by Oscar Wirkkala. It is accomplished with two lines (cables) and two winches (or cable drums). The mainline or yarding line extends out from one winch, while a second usually lighter line called the haulback line extends out from the other winch to a 'tail block' or pulley at the tail (back) end of the logging site, and passes through the tail block and connects to the main line. <b>Butt</b> <b>rigging</b> is installed where the two lines join and the logs are hooked to the <b>butt</b> <b>rigging</b> with chokers. The procedure is to wind up the main line and the logs are pulled in, wind up the haulback and the <b>butt</b> <b>rigging</b> is pulled out for more logs or another 'turn'.|$|E
