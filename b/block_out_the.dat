5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E

A male figure in a red Phrygian cap (a symbol of the French and American Revolutions) reclines with his arm around the waist of a female figure (identified as a bacchante by Sarah Burnage of the University of York). The female figure shades her eyes, either against the brightness of the angel or to <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> horror taking place in front of her.|$|E
5|$|The scenes {{on board}} the Queen Anne were filmed aboard the famous {{passenger}} liner RMS Queen Mary, which has long {{been used as a}} hotel. The X-Files crew spent a total of eleven days filming on the Queen Mary, and erected wrap-around scaffolding on the bridge in order to <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> lights of nearby Long Beach, California. To make it look like it was raining during the scenes on the bridge, the crew installed large sprinkler systems to provide a constant supply of water. Unhappy with the remodeled style of the ship's corridors and ballroom, Carter had portions of the ship recarpeted and redecorated to give the finished episode a late-1930s style.|$|E

5|$|Shots {{where the}} {{spacecraft}} had parts in motion or the perspective changed were shot by directly filming the model. For most shots {{the model was}} stationary and camera was driven along a track on a special mount, the motor of which was mechanically linked to the camera motor—making it possible to repeat camera moves and match speeds exactly. Elements of the scene were recorded on same piece of film in separate passes to combine the lit model, stars, planets, or other spacecraft in the same shot. In moving shots of the long Discovery One spacecraft, {{in order to keep}} the entire model in focus, multiple passes had to be made with the lighting on it blocked out section by section. In each pass the camera would be focused on the one lit section. Many matting techniques were tried to <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> stars behind the models, with film makers sometimes resorting to hand tracing frame by frame around the image of the spacecraft (rotoscoping) to create the matte.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} Test at Sophia Gardens, Strauss failed to {{capitalise}} on two starts, scoring 30 and 17; his second-innings dismissal, caught off a top-edged cut off Nathan Hauritz, was particularly poor. On a good batting wicket Australia racked up 674 for 6 declared, with Simon Katich (122), Ricky Ponting (150), Marcus North (125 not out) and Brad Haddin (121) all scoring centuries. In the second innings, only a dogged 5¾-hour 74 from Paul Collingwood and tail-end contributions salvaged a draw for England, with final pair James Anderson and Monty Panesar left to <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> final 11½ overs of the match.|$|E
25|$|A {{crowd of}} a couple of hundred saw Bangladesh's opening batsman Javed Omar hit three {{boundaries}} in the opening overs, but he was run out by Russel Arnold, and from then on, Bangladesh lost wickets regularly. No partnership passed 30 until that of the very last wicket, by which time it was all too late. Dilhara Fernando started the procession, deceiving Tushar Imran and Mohammad Ashraful to send them back for single-figure scores, and joint top-scorer Shahriar Nafees was fourth to fall, giving a return catch to Dilshan. Following Nafees' dismissal, Bangladesh quickly crashed to 103 for 8, with fast bowler Farveez Maharoof taking three wickets. Eventually, Bangladesh needed 143 for the last wicket off 98 deliveries, and Khaled Mashud and Tapash Baisya opted to <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> overs instead - while the Sri Lankan captain gave the ball to his spinners to get the match over with quickly, the three seamers Chaminda Vaas, Fernando and Maharoof only bowling 20 of a possible 30 overs.|$|E

500|$|The land {{on which}} the Green sits was {{originally}} a pine forest, with some trees reaching the height of 270 feet (82 m), high enough to <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> sun. The process of clearing the pines was begun in 1770 by the newly founded Dartmouth College. The village plan of Hanover was laid out the following year and included as its central feature an open square of [...] (three hectares). Even though the land had been cleared, many tree stumps remained until 1831; for a long period, it was a Dartmouth tradition for the graduating class to remove one stump.|$|E
500|$|Filming was {{conducted}} in and around Slough, Buckinghamshire and Maidenhead, Berkshire over five weeks between May and June 1960. The Slough location shooting made use of [...] the AP Films Studio itself (doubling as the gang's warehouse), a café {{on the other side}} of the road (as the main hideout), the woods of Burnham Beeches and various points along the A4 road. Halliford Studios in Shepperton, Surrey was also used briefly for filming. On one occasion, when the production had fallen behind schedule and night filming inside the café had run into the morning, the crew attached black drapes to the windows to <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> dawn sunlight and allow the shoot to finish.|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from that}} of the children, little sympathy is {{directed}} toward the bird; David Solkin suggests the subjects of the painting show the dispassionate detachment of the evolving scientific society.

[...] To one side of the boy at the rear, the cockatoo's empty cage can be seen on the wall, and to further heighten the drama it is unclear whether the boy is lowering the cage on the pulley to allow the bird to be replaced after the experiment or hoisting the cage back up, certain of its former occupant's death. It has also been suggested that he may be drawing the curtains to <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> light from the full moon.|$|E
500|$|Music of the Sun {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times viewed that the album's combination of dancehall and pop resulted in [...] " [...] one [...] the summer's {{biggest and most}} seductive club tracks", but felt that Rihanna sounded [...] "stranded" [...] without a beat to sing along to. Barry Walters of Rolling Stone found it lacking in replay value, ingenuity, and rhythm, with [...] "generic vocal hiccups and frills" [...] of US R inflecting upon her [...] "Caribbean charm". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the album a [...] "glut of teen R chanteuses" [...] and described the lead single [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] as [...] "a dancehall-pop mixture that owes plenty of its sweat and shimmy to Beyoncé Knowles' [...] "Baby Boy". Evan Serpick of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Rihanna's [...] "vibrant vocals lift tracks like [...] "That La, La, La" [...] and [...] "Let Me," [...] but this bland reggae/R debut is filled with chintzy production and maudlin arrangements that <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Music of the Sun." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice rated the album a [...] "dud", indicating [...] "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought." ...|$|E
500|$|Neela Debnath of The Independent commented {{positively}} on the show's continuing {{exploration of}} the Daleks and the more [...] "adult tone", praising {{the performance of the}} three leads. Radio Times writer Patrick Mulkern stated that it [...] "ticks all [...] boxes as a Doctor Who fan of more than 40 years standing", describing it as [...] "clever, fast, funny, eerie, surprising and tearjerking". Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the episode five out of five stars, calling it a [...] "strong, cinematically-minded series opener" [...] which succeeded in making the Daleks scary. He also praised Coleman's debut, Smith's performance, the special effects, and Amy and Rory's emotional subplot. io9 reviewer Charlie Jane Anders noted that the plot [...] "is mostly just an excuse to explore the Doctor's ongoing relationship with the Daleks, and to show how sad it's gotten". Both Anders and Mulkern (the latter citing a Doctor Who veteran, Katy Manning) noted that Oswin's fascination with eggs, required for making soufflés, is really just a mental trick to <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> [...] "exterminate" [...] ("eggs-terminate") conditioning; this literary device is woven throughout the episode as a series of subtle hints, as Rory is confused by a dormant Dalek, initially misinterpreting him as saying [...] "eggs".|$|E

500|$|Filming was {{originally}} {{set to begin}} in early 1998. In the summer of 1997, Superman Lives entered pre-production, with an art department employed under production designer Rick Heinrichs. Burton hired Wesley Strick to rewrite Smith's script. Smith was disappointed, stating, [...] "The studio was happy with what I was doing. Then Tim Burton got involved, and when he signed his pay-or-play deal, {{he turned around and}} said he wanted to do his version of Superman. So who is Warner Bros. going back to? The guy who made Clerks, or the guy who made them half a billion dollars on Batman?" [...] When Strick read Smith's script, he was annoyed with the fact that [...] "Superman was accompanied/shadowed by someone/something called the Eradicator." [...] He also felt that [...] "Brainiac's evil plot of launching a disk in space to <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> sun and make Superman powerless was reminiscent of an episode of The Simpsons, with Mr. Burns doing the Brainiac role." [...] However, after reading The Death and Return of Superman, Strick was able to understand some of the elements of Smith's script. Strick's rewrite featured Superman as an existentialist, thinking of himself to be an outsider on Earth. Superman is threatened by Brainiac and Lex Luthor, who later amalgamate into [...] "Lexiac," [...] described by Strick as [...] "a schizo/scary mega-villain." [...] Superman is later resurrected by the power of 'K,' a natural force representing the spirit of Krypton, as he defeats Lexiac.|$|E
500|$|All of the {{interior}} scenes were shot at sound stages inside Kling Studios. Most of the exterior shots were filmed at Bronson Canyon, a set of caves at Griffith Park in Los Angeles that was a popular shooting location for low-budget films. The exterior scenes of the tracking station were shot at a television station on Mount Lee, {{not far from the}} Hollywood Sign. Varno said it was the first television station built in Los Angeles, but was only being used for emergency broadcasts when Blood Beast was filmed; it had also been used during World War II to send information and propaganda to the Allied Forces' overseas allies. Varno secured permission to film there simply by calling the city of Los Angeles and asking permission, something he said nobody else considered trying because they assumed the city would not allow it. Varno was familiar with the station because his father, Roland Varno, appeared in the first dramatic television show released in Los Angeles and it was transmitted from that station. For the Blood Beast shoot, Los Angeles charged a fee of $8 per actor to shoot at the station, but the crew could be any size. All shooting took place outside the station and none inside. Most of the station night scenes there were shot during the day, and the film crew often had to find shadows to shoot in or <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> sun to give the impression of nighttime. Gene Corman said of the shooting: [...] "That was one of the more mobile units I've ever been involved with. Normally, everybody chases the sun; we were chasing the shadows." ...|$|E
500|$|Manners {{noted that}} [...] "Closure" [...] {{was one of}} the first episodes in which the {{production}} staff was able to [...] "shoot in Los Angeles with the sun out". According to Manners, the show was struggling with the fact that [...] "we weren't in Vancouver anymore and that our show had suddenly become very bright and cheery". To amend this, Bill Roe, director of photography, used tree branches and c-stands to <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> sunlight. [...] The first scene with the walk-ins rising up from their grave, shot at Griffith Park above the playground, was [...] "tricky," [...] according to director Kim Manners. Manners felt uncomfortable telling the children to rise out of [...] "graves", feeling it could psychologically hurt them, so instead the crew called the holes in the ground [...] "forts." [...] The scenes taking place at April Air Force Base was shot in San Bernardino, California at a closed airfield, the former Norton Air Force Base. On the airbase was a large abandoned house complex of over 400 buildings constructed and used by the United States military. [...] According to Manners, the entire area was [...] "eerie", and many of the houses still had furniture in them. Originally, the producers wanted to name the fictitious air force March Air Force Base. However, the presence of an actual air force base with the same name necessitated a change to April Air Force Base. One of the shots in the April Air Force Base was filmed at a sound stage in Los Angeles. The scene at the restaurant was shot in a location on Sepulveda Boulevard, at a hotel that had been standing there for 30 to 40 years.|$|E
