5|$|By 1100, {{there were}} several Crusader states, {{including}} the Principality of Antioch, founded by Bohemond in 1098. It was argued that Antioch should <b>be</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines, despite Alexios's supposed betrayals, but Bohemond claimed it for himself. Alexios, of course, disagreed; Antioch had an important port, was a trade hub with Asia and a stronghold of the Eastern Orthodox Church, with an important Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch. It had only been captured from the empire a few decades previously, unlike Jerusalem, which was much farther away and {{had not been in}} Byzantine hands for centuries. Alexios therefore did not recognize the legitimacy of the Principality, believing it should <b>be</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Empire according to the oaths Bohemond had sworn in 1097. He therefore set about trying to evict Bohemond from Antioch.|$|E
