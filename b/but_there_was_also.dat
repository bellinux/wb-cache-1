5|$|After {{these talks}} with Rudd, Lobengula called an indaba (conference) of over 100 izinDuna {{to present the}} {{proposed}} concession terms to them and gauge their sympathies. It {{soon became clear that}} opinion was split: most of the younger izinDuna were opposed to the idea of any concession whatsoever, while the king himself and many of his older izinDuna were open to considering Rudd's bid. The idea of a mining monopoly in the hands of Rudd's powerful backers was attractive to the Matabele in some ways, as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small-time prospectors, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> a case for allowing competition to continue, so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula's favour.|$|E
5|$|The 1949 {{detonation}} of Joe-1 by the Soviet Union prompted {{an all-out}} {{effort by the}} United States, led by Teller, to develop the more powerful hydrogen bomb in response. Henry D. Smyth, Wheeler's department head at Princeton, asked him to join the effort. Most physicists were, like Wheeler, trying to re-establish careers interrupted by the war and were reluctant to face more disruption. Others had moral objections. Those who agreed to participate included Emil Konopinski, Marshall Rosenbluth, Lothar Nordheim and Charles Critchfield, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> now a body of experienced weapons physicists at the Los Alamos Laboratory, led by Norris Bradbury. Wheeler agreed to go to Los Alamos after a conversation with Bohr. Two of his graduate students from Princeton, Ken Ford and John Toll, joined him there.|$|E
5|$|The virgin forests cooled {{the land}} and streams, and centuries of {{accumulated}} organic matter in the forest soil caused slow percolation of rainfall into the creeks and runs so that they flowed more evenly year-round. Pine Creek and its tributaries were home to large numbers of fish, including trout, but dams downstream on the Susquehanna River have eliminated the shad and eels once found here by blocking their migrations. Habitat for land animals was destroyed by the clearcutting of forests, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> {{a great deal of}} hunting, with bounties paid for large predators.|$|E

5|$|Fouroux was {{succeeded by}} Daniel Dubroca, who coached {{the team to}} the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Dubroca's tenure as coach did not last long, however, as he {{resigned}} after violently confronting referee David Bishop following France's World Cup quarter-final against England. Dubroca was replaced by Pierre Berbizier, who coached the team until after the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Berbizier's replacement, Jean-Claude Skrela, coached France to Five Nations Grand Slams in 1997 and 1998 before they came last in the tournament in 1999. He officially resigned following France's loss to Australia in the 1999 Rugby World Cup final. Bernard Laporte was appointed as Skrela's successor in November. Laporte guided France through the 2003 and 2007 Rugby World Cups before stepping down to become Secretary of State for Sport. After Philippe Saint-André turned down the offer to replace Laporte, French Rugby Federation president Bernard Lapasset appointed Marc Lièvremont to guide France to the 2011 World Cup. Lièvremont's tenure as coach was marked by inconsistent and puzzling squad selection choices, and player discontent. There were some bright moments, notably wins against New Zealand in Dunedin and South Africa in Toulouse, and the 2010 Six Nations Grand Slam. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> a 59–16 loss to Australia in Paris, a 22–21 loss to Italy in the 2011 Six Nations, and a 19–14 loss to Tonga during the 2011 World Cup. In August 2011, before the World Cup, {{it was announced that}} Philippe Saint-André would replace Lièvremont and guide France to the 2015 World Cup. This came as no surprise to Lièvremont, as he had announced as early as May 2010 that he would not continue as the coach of France after the World Cup.|$|E
5|$|The 15th {{edition of}} the Belk Bowl was played in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday, December 29, 2016. This was the 24th {{consecutive}} bowl game for Virginia Tech and Justin Fuente's first bowl game as {{head coach of the}} Hokies football team. This was the first time ever these two teams played each other. The first and second halves were totally different in terms of how each team did. Virginia Tech was losing 24-0 at halftime but turned the game around in the second half aided by 3 interceptions and six sacks, and won 24-35. This resulted in a season record of 10-4 and was the first time a Hokie football coach won 10 games in his first season and the first Hokie 10-win season since 2011. This {{was the first time the}} Hokies won 3 straight bowl games. Only one of the 5 Hokie touchdowns was not the result of an Arkansas turnover. This was the only game in the college football 2016 in which a team trailing by 24 or more points ended up winning the game. There was a very confusing ruling in the second quarter that took the officials about 12 minutes to sort out. Arkansas punted and the Hokies muffed it. Arkansas touched the ball and the Hokies recovered. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> an inadvertent whistle blown. Officials disagree on what the ruling should have been. The game officials gave the ball back to Arkansas.|$|E

25|$|The Renaissance was {{inspired}} by the growth in study of Latin and Greek texts and the admiration of the Greco-Roman era as a golden age. This prompted many artists and writers to begin drawing from Roman and Greek examples for their works, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> much innovation in this period, especially by multi-faceted artists such as Leonardo da Vinci. The Humanists saw their repossession of a great past as a Renaissance—a rebirth of civilization itself.|$|E
25|$|There was resistance, {{much of it}} from Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> {{a pattern}} of denial, {{cover-up}} and cozy bureaucratic collusion between industry and government, the last especially notorious in Japan {{but by no means}} limited to that country. Even then, pro-nuclear power forces could prevail only by managing to instill in the minds of Japanese people a dichotomy between the physics of nuclear power and that of nuclear weapons, an illusory distinction made not only in Japan but throughout the world.|$|E

25|$|Resistance {{against the}} German {{occupiers}} of Belgium {{can be seen}} at all levels and from all quarters of the political spectrum, but was highly fragmented. The Government in Exile dealt with resistance collectively under the name Armée Secrète, however this was just a broad name for the many resistance organisations which existed. Some organisations were very left-wing, like the Communist Front de l'Indépendance, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> a far-right resistance movement, the Légion Belge which comprised dissident Rexists.

25|$|Courses, {{mouldings}} and all decorative {{details are}} carved with great precision.

Some architects were stricter in their use of classical details than others, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> a good deal of innovation in solving problems, especially at corners. Mouldings stand out around doors and windows rather than being recessed, as in Gothic Architecture. Sculptured figures may be set in niches or placed on plinths. They are not integral to the building as in Medieval architecture.|$|E
25|$|Men were {{introduced}} into the field of obstetrics {{in the nineteenth century}} and resulted in a change of the focus of this profession. Gynaecology directly resulted as a new and separate field of study from obstetrics and focused on the curing of illness and indispositions of female sexual organs. This had some relevance to some conditions as menopause, uterine and cervical problems, and childbirth could leave the mother in need of extensive surgery to repair tissue. <b>But,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> a large blame of the uterus for completely unrelated conditions. This led to many social consequences of the nineteenth century.|$|E

25|$|Before being encircled, the Ninth Army {{had already}} {{suffered}} heavy {{losses in the}} Battle of the Seelow Heights.

In all, there were about 80,000 men in the pocket, the majority of whom belonged to the Ninth Army, consisting of the XI SS Panzer Corps, V SS Mountain Corps and the newly acquired V Corps, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> the Frankfurt Garrison. The number of tanks reported included 36 tanks in the XI SS Panzer Corps, including up to 14 King Tigers of the 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion.
