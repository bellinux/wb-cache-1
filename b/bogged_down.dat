5|$|On 5 July 1943 the Wehrmacht {{launched}} its offensive. On the northern {{side of the}} salient, the German forces <b>bogged</b> <b>down</b> within four days. On the southern side, the German 4th Panzer Army, with Army Detachment Kempf on its eastern flank, attacked the Soviet defences of the Voronezh Front. They made slow but steady progress through the Soviet defensive lines.|$|E
5|$|His writing {{style is}} best {{described}} as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has a taste for garish analogies and offbeat allusions—often very funny ones—and he speaks in no uncertain terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get <b>bogged</b> <b>down</b> in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He does not, in short, write like a happy man.|$|E
5|$|In January 1863, Burnside {{launched}} a second offensive against Lee, but it <b>bogged</b> <b>down</b> in winter rains before it accomplished anything {{and has been}} derisively called the Mud March. In its wake, he asked that several openly insubordinate officers be relieved of duty and court-martialed; he also offered to resign. Lincoln chose the latter option on January 26 and replaced him with Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, {{one of the officers}} who had conspired against Burnside.|$|E

5|$|The Australian 7th and 9th Divisions {{converged on}} Lae, which fell on 16 September. MacArthur {{advanced}} his timetable, {{and ordered the}} 7th to capture Kaiapit and Dumpu, while the 9th mounted an amphibious assault on Finschhafen. Here, the offensive <b>bogged</b> <b>down,</b> partly because MacArthur had based his decision to assault Finschhafen on Willoughby's assessment that there were only 350 Japanese defenders at Finschhafen, when in fact there were nearly 5,000. A furious battle ensued.|$|E
5|$|When the First World War {{broke out}} in August 1914 the British Army sent the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), {{consisting}} mainly of regular army troops, to France and Belgium. The fighting <b>bogged</b> <b>down</b> into static trench warfare {{for the remainder of}} the war. In 1915 the army created the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force to invade the Ottoman Empire via Gallipoli, an unsuccessful attempt to capture Constantinople and secure a sea route to Russia.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, in July 1864, Saraiva's {{persistent}} diplomacy {{moved the}} Uruguayan government {{to agree to}} mediated talks including Edward Thornton (the British resident minister in Buenos Aires), Argentine foreign minister Rufino de Elizalde and Saraiva himself. Initially, the negotiations seemed promising, but soon <b>bogged</b> <b>down.</b> On 4 August, convinced that the government in Montevideo was unwilling to work toward a settlement, a frustrated Saraiva delivered an ultimatum, which the Uruguayans rebuffed. On 10 August, Saraiva informed Aguirre that the Brazilian military commanders would receive orders to begin retaliation, marking {{the beginning of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September, XXXVI Corps {{launched}} a frontal assault against the Soviet fortifications but made only slow progress. XXXVI Corps attempted another flanking attack similar to Kayrela, with one German regiment trying {{to circumvent the}} Soviet defenses in the south. This time it did not work as well, and the German effort <b>bogged</b> <b>down</b> against heavy resistance. After days of fighting, the Germans were finally able to push behind the Voyta River only to be confronted by another even stronger Soviet defense line. The so-called VL or Verman Line stretched from Lake Verkhneye Verman to Lake Tolvand and included heavy Soviet pre-war fortifications.|$|E
5|$|One {{reason for}} the success of the {{offensive}} in this sector was the failure of Falkenhausen to employ a defence in depth. In theory, the enemy would be allowed to make initial gains, thus stretching their lines of communication. Reserves held close to the battlefield would be committed once the initial advance had <b>bogged</b> <b>down,</b> before enemy reinforcements could be brought up. The defenders would thus be able to counter-attack and regain any lost territory. In this sector, Falkenhausen kept his reserve troops too far from the front and they were too late for a useful counter-attack on either 10 or 11 April.|$|E

5|$|The {{deliberate}} {{planting of}} fake documents {{to be found}} by the enemy was not new; known as the Haversack Ruse, it had been practised by the British {{and others in the}} First and Second World Wars. In August 1942, before the Battle of Alam el Halfa, a corpse was placed in a blown-up scout car, in a minefield facing the German 90th Light Division. On the corpse was a map purportedly showing the locations of British minefields; the Germans used the map and their tanks were routed to areas of soft sand where they <b>bogged</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{the lead}} T-34s reached the minefield, they {{came under heavy fire}} from the fort's garrison. Soon all three tanks were either {{destroyed}} or damaged, so the combat engineers proceeded to breach the minefield on their own. Israeli aircraft began strafing and bombing the Egyptian forces for over {{two and a half hours}} while encountering no resistance, leading to the destruction of all six tanks and five vehicles. The Israelis bombed Egyptian forces at the minefield and on an area of the strip stretching two kilometers towards Port Fouad. Under fire from the air and from the fort, the attack <b>bogged</b> <b>down</b> to a complete halt before the Egyptians began to retreat. Salah ordered his battalion to assume defensive positions east of Port Fouad to repel any Israeli counterattack and to regroup.|$|E
5|$|At Jig, {{the first}} wave of {{infantry}} (the 1st Dorsetshires and 1st Hampshires of the 231st Infantry Brigade) arrived at 07:25, and immediately came under fire from the casemated 75mm gun at Le Hamel. Due to navigation errors and the strong current, both groups came ashore well to the east of their intended landing points. The DD tank and Royal Marine Centaur tanks that were supposed to arrive in advance of the landing were delayed by rough seas and did not arrive until 08:00. Many of the tanks got <b>bogged</b> <b>down</b> on the beach or were taken out by enemy fire. The tide came in quicker than expected, before many of the beach obstacles and mines were cleared, and some of the landing craft were damaged as a result.|$|E

25|$|The last {{large-scale}} offensive of {{this period}} was a British attack (with French support) at Passchendaele (July–November 1917). This offensive opened with great promise for the Allies, before <b>bogging</b> <b>down</b> in the October mud. Casualties, though disputed, were roughly equal, at some 200,000–400,000 per side.|$|R
5|$|British General John Burgoyne moved {{south from}} the {{province}} of Quebec in June 1777 {{to gain control of}} the upper Hudson River valley. His campaign had become <b>bogged</b> <b>down</b> in difficulties following a victory at Fort Ticonderoga. Elements of the army had reached the upper Hudson as early as the end of July, but logistical and supply difficulties delayed the main army at Fort Edward. One attempt to alleviate these difficulties failed when nearly 1,000 men were killed or captured at the August 16 Battle of Bennington. Furthermore, news reached Burgoyne on August 28 that St. Leger's expedition down the Mohawk River valley had turned back after the failed Siege of Fort Stanwix.|$|E
5|$|In {{the planned}} {{offensive}} on the Sangro, C Squadron was {{to follow the}} 19th Armoured Regiment in its advance at 03:00. Although its tanks reached the river, they <b>bogged</b> <b>down</b> {{in the mud and}} the squadron remained on the other bank as B Squadron advanced to Monte Marconi. Three troops from C Squadron finally crossed the river by the afternoon of 29 November; one was ordered to advance to Elici and a second was to make contact with the 8th Indian Infantry Division at La Defenza. The routes were mined and the troops spent the night at 23rd Battalion headquarters. In the morning, the mines were cleared and the second troop contacted the Indians and advanced east of Elici; the first troop was held up by shelling south of Elici.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June, the 7th Armoured Division {{took over}} parts of 50th Northumbrian Division front with the 56th Infantry Brigade under command. By nightfall, the 7th Armoured Division {{had reached the}} {{north-western}} fringe of Tilly-sur-Seulles and next day penetrated the village capturing the central crossroads. The Panzer-Lehr Division made several counter-attacks, which forced the British out and attacks by the 50th (Northumbrian) Division <b>bogged</b> <b>down</b> in the bocage against the Panzer-Lehr Division. Army Group B planned to relieve the armoured divisions facing the Second Army from 11 June {{and replace them with}} infantry divisions, to concentrate the tanks in the Carentan area and avert the danger to Cherbourg. Adolf Hitler overruled Rommel and the next day ordered him not to retreat and instead roll up the Allied beachhead from east to west, starting with the Orne bridgehead.|$|E
50|$|Jackson pursued {{negotiations}} with {{the administration and the}} Soviet Union on the terms of the amendment.

5|$|On 16 October, the JNA {{mounted a}} major attack against Borovo Naselje. It made some progress, but became <b>bogged</b> <b>down</b> {{in the face}} of {{determined}} Croatian resistance. On 30 October, the JNA launched a fully coordinated assault, spearheaded by paramilitary forces, with infantry and engineering troops systematically forcing their way past the Croatian lines. The JNA's forces, divided into northern and southern operations sectors, attacked several points simultaneously and pushed the Croatians back. The JNA also adopted new tactics, such as firing directly into houses and then driving tanks through them, as well as using tear gas and smoke bombs to drive out those inside. Buildings were also captured with the use of anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
5|$|The 15th then pursued {{retreating}} German {{forces in}} the direction of Poltava. Late on 16February it captured Zalyutino and engaged German troops at Pesochnya on the road to Liubotyn. After capturing Pesochnya two days later, the 15th began the battle for Liubotyn against troops of the Grossdeutschland Division, but became <b>bogged</b> <b>down</b> in heavy fighting for the city. The corps' 195th Tank Brigade and the 160th Division were ordered to bypass the city and attempt to capture Staryi Merchik. On 21February they advanced on Liubotyn from the west, and the Grossdeutschland Division began its retreat from the city on the next day. In the battle for Liubotyn between 21and 22February, the corps reported killing 400 German soldiers and destroying 12 tanks, while suffering losses of 360 killed and wounded and six tanks.|$|E
5|$|The South Vietnamese M113s had {{no problem}} {{crossing}} the generally shallow streams and rivers typical of the Mekong Delta, but the heavy 10-ton M113s became <b>bogged</b> <b>down</b> in the deeper Cong Ba Ky Canal, forcing the crews and the infantry company on board to cut down brush and trees and fill the canal until it was shallow enough for the M113s to cross. The rescue operation was further delayed when Ba tried to obtain proper authorization to advance, because he was under orders not to take commands directly from the American advisers. Vann, who was flying above the armored formation, demanded that Ba advance immediately. Ba replied {{that he would not}} take instructions from Americans. When Vann threatened to have Ba shot, he reluctantly continued to advance, although very slowly, toward the entrenched Viet Cong.|$|E
