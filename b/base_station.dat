5|$|The Terrestrial Trunked Radio {{network has}} three {{components:}} the core net, {{which is a}} centralized computer center based on an Internet Protocol structure; the transmission net, which connects the core net, the radio net and other connection points with high-capacity lines; and the radio net, which consists of base stations with antennas in masts, on buildings and in some tunnels. The network is controlled by Motorola. In case a <b>base</b> <b>station</b> no longer can communicate with the core net, the <b>base</b> <b>station</b> can still relay communication within its range. Should the <b>base</b> <b>station</b> fall out or operations occur in areas without coverage, the terminals can communicate directly with each other.|$|E

5|$|Using {{conventional}} GSM systems {{was rejected}} also because GSM lacks {{many of the}} functionalities of TETRA, such as group conversations, dispatcher centers, and direct communication. In addition, Global System for Mobile Communication – Railway (GSM-R) was considered, but rejected {{because of the lack}} of trans-border functionality and the need for more base stations, and thus higher investment costs, and longer start-up time for calls. The technology was considered because the Norwegian National Rail Administration was at the time building a GSM-R network to cover the entire Norwegian railway network. Another reason that TETRA was preferred was that at the time of decision there were five manufacturers of TETRA equipment and only two for GSM-R. TETRA also allows a fall-back system, where a <b>base</b> <b>station</b> can allow communication between users within the range of the <b>base</b> <b>station,</b> even if the central parts of the network break down.|$|E

This problem is considerably {{harder than the}} one treated in [1] where <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> were organized in a starred network and no obstacles were present. In these models nodes communicate through a clusterehead gateway switching routing protocol. In [1] both host clustering and <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> repositioning computations were performed by {{the center of the}} star. Here movable <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> are organized in an Ad-Hoc Network. Clustering, center computation and repositioning are performed in a distributed fashion among the <b>base</b> <b>stations.</b> The amount of transmitted information is proportional to the number of <b>base</b> <b>stations.</b> Obstacles which may interfere with hosts clustering and <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> motion are present.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 31) With {{the enormous}} growth in telecommunication industry, energy efficiency {{has become a}} critical issue. <b>Base</b> <b>stations</b> account for {{a significant portion of}} the energy budget of a cellular network. Traditional energy saving techniques switch some <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> off completely during light loads to save energy. This creates problems for the backhaul network and also for quickly returning to full capacity when demand increases. In this paper, we propose a novel technique called cell zooming to reduce energy consumption at <b>base</b> <b>stations.</b> With cell zooming, <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> dynamically adjust their coverage radius and hence their transmit powers based on user locations. The transmit power is set to the minimum required level depending on user locations and signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) required. <b>Base</b> <b>stations</b> are never completely switched off. Simulations show that the proposed cell zooming algorithm reduces the energy consumption of <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> by up to 40 % without compromising the quality of service (QoS) for users compared to traditional static-coverage-area <b>base</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R

The latter <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> performed successive interference cancellation, which used additional multiple antenna processing. Reference[14] assumed that some <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> in the cell can decode multiple user data using their multiple antennas and then exchange the estimated data with the other <b>base</b> <b>stations.</b> Then, the forwarded data were used for interference cancellation when the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the femtocell due to the MUE interference was negligible.|$|R
