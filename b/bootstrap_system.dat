40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} baryon-antibaryon {{bootstrap}} model which, for the meson spectrum, we understand to be an alternative of the quark model. Starting from the baryon octets, the forces are constructed from the t-channel singularities of the nearest meson multiplets and transformed into an SU(3) symmetric potential. At this stage {{we assume that the}} baryon and meson multiplets are degenerate. Any contributions from the u-channel are neglected for it is exotic and only contains the deuteron. The dynamical equation governing the <b>bootstrap</b> <b>system</b> is the relativistic analog of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation which is an integral equation in the baryon c. m. momentum. The potential is chosen to take account of relativistic effects. Inelastic contributions such as two-meson intermediate states are neglected. Reasons why they must be small are discussed. We are looking for a self-consistent solution of the <b>bootstrap</b> <b>system</b> in which baryon-antibaryon bound state multiplets, to be interpreted as mesons, are forced to coincide with the input meson multiplets. Furthermore, the output coupling constants and F/D ratios have, to a certain extent, to agree with their input values. Practically, it is required that the <b>bootstrap</b> <b>system</b> consists of only a few multiplets, the remainder being decoupled approximately. A self-consistent solution is found comprising scalar, pseudoscalar and vector singlets and octets with masses being in good agreement with their average physical masses. The coupling constants and F/D ratios turn out to be consistent with experiment and other ideas. Possible origins of SU(3) breaking are then investigated. The spontaneous breakdown of SLJ(3) is ruled out {{by the fact that the}} dynamics is stable against small perturbations of the input masses. Instead, a solution of the symmetry breaking is given in terms of bootstrapped singlet-octet mixing. 2 1...|$|E

The full range of degradation in each fault is considered, allowing the quantification of overall system performance degradation. The performance of the system is found to be insensitive to moderate bleed air blockages (up to 80 % by pipe cross-section area), whilst blockages at low pressure are more detrimental to cycle performance than blockages at high pressure. The cycle and/or control system will self-regulate around most degrading-type faults.

There are two main parts to our project: to construct a general (probably probabilistic) framework for confidence scoring and to utilize active learning to enhance confidence scoring. Our system will not learn any specific facts or relations. It is most appropriate for our system to be placed inside a general (or specific) bootstrap learning system to aid in quality control of both facts and patterns the system gathers. Put differently, our system is to help a bootstrap learning system from perishing or diverging far away from the truth (the word truth is used loosely as a concept – both facts and patterns – the corpus and the labeler believe to be true) due to patterns and facts gathered by the system that are inappropriate for the given task.

40|$|A fast {{response}} {{is critical in}} many data-intensive applications, including knowledge discovery analytics on big data, and queries searching for complex patterns in sequences, data streams and graphs. Moreover, the volume of data and {{the complexity of the}} analytical tasks they must support are now growing at such a torrid rate that the vigorous progress in performance and scalability of computer systems cannot keep up with it. This situation calls for (i) effective optimization techniques to reduce the cost of complex pattern queries, and (ii) approximation techniques to produce results of predictable accuracy using a small subset of the data. In this dissertation we (i) introduce new query languages and optimization techniques for pattern matching in sequences, data streams and graphs, and (ii) formulate a general approximation model for analytics queries. Thus, in this dissertation we have made the following contributions:(i) We have designed and demonstrated optimized implementation techniques for K*SQL and XSeq, which provide a unified framework for complex pattern searching on relational and XML DBs, respectively. In particular, we introduced efficient execution exploiting recent advances in automata theory known as Nested Words. (ii) We have designed and demonstrated efficient scalable graph search engine based on novel distributed memory-based system architecture, and exploit graph exploration operations for implementing an efficient graph search algorithm. (iii) We have introduced support for bootstrap methods in MapReduce. Bootstrap is a very useful estimation technique for sampling-based approximation. Thus we designed the EARL of Hadoop system, that facilitates and optimizes the use bootstrap methods on parallel MapReduce systems. (iv) We have then invented and demonstrated an analytical model for bootstrap, whereby the Monte-Carlo evaluation of the standard method is replaced by a probabilistic query. Thus, we provided a semiring-based extension of relational algebra and related query optimization techniques to support fast execution of the resulting probabilistic query.
