40|$|Navigational charts are a {{valuable}} data {{source for the}} study of morphological change in estuaries, as they provide bathymetric information of many estuaries, and span a vast period of time. Charts are suitable for studying patterns of morphological change, such as shoal and channel migration. In addition, sequential <b>bathymetric</b> <b>charts</b> or bed surveys can be used to calculate sedimentation and erosion rates. However, a number of problems arise when using these data to identify morphological change. Sources of error and uncertainty are associated with surveying techniques used, density of depth sampling points, interpolation and averaging during compilation of the chart. Large systematic errors may stem from the non-uniformity or poorly defined levels to which the depths on the charts are reduced. Errors propagate in spatiotemporal operations using such charts. Analysis of historical <b>bathymetric</b> <b>charts</b> from the Ribble estuary (north-west England) illustrates the difficulties involved in assessing morphological change in a quantitative manner. The pattern of morphological development within the Ribble estuary over the last 150 years was clear, and a significant long-term net accretional trend was found. However, temporal variations in the rate of sedimentation on a decadal scale were generally not significant [KEYWORDS: north-west England, <b>bathymetric</b> <b>charts,</b> morphology, sediment budget, error, estuaries, Ribble estuary...|$|R

50|$|In {{an ideal}} case, the joining of a <b>bathymetric</b> <b>chart</b> and {{topographic}} {{map of the}} same scale and projection of the same geographic area would be seamless.

Thus the topographic map's mountains have the greatest values while the bathymetric chart's greatest depths have the greatest values.

40|$|Based on {{data from}} R/V Polarstern multibeam sonar surveys between 1984 and 1997 a high {{resolution}} bathymetry has been generated for the central Fram Strait. The area ensonified covers approx. 36, 500 sqkm between 78 degN- 80 degN and 0 degE- 7. 5 degE.

50|$|Because {{features}} {{and conditions of}} the world's oceans are constantly changing, surveying, charting and mapping must be continuous processes. Experiences during World War I showed the need for greater accuracy for oceanographic data.

50|$|Kyyvesi (transl.Viper Water) is {{a rather}} large lake in the Southern Savonia region of Finland. Spite its size (129,95 km²) it's very shallow and {{extremely}} rocky.

50|$|The {{status of}} the purported island also {{became the subject of}} {{discussion}} on scientific mailing lists such as GMT-HELP in late November 2012. Some scientists were initially skeptical that such an error could exist, since a signature was present in various global terrain data sets, such as the bathymetric data from the General <b>Bathymetric</b> <b>Chart</b> of the Oceans, which reported an elevation of 1 m over the location of Sandy Island. Some data sets derived from satellite imagery indicated that sea surface temperatures were absent in the location, suggesting the presence of land. However, it became apparent that a land mask was applied to these data sets during pre-processing to differentiate between land and water. Since the World Vector Shoreline Database (WVS) has become the standard global coastline data set used by the scientific community, errors that existed in WVS propagated into data sets that use a land mask. Therefore, rather than providing independent evidence for the existence of an island, the appearance of Sandy Island in bathymetry and satellite imagery data sets originated from spurious digitized geometries derived from the WVS database.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century mapping the seafloor was a very difficult task.

INFOMAR has captured a huge amount of Multi-beam Echo Sounder (MBES) sonar data, and has successfully implemented techniques to classify seabed character from MBES backscatter data.

The presented hotspot-independent model, which is in line with the absence of plumes and with the non-linear arrangement of the Atlantis-Meteor seamount complex and of the Azores, explains the excessive vulcanism as a result of fault zones formed by lithospheric fracturing.
