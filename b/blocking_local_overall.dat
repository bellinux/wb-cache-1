The choice between general anesthesia, peripheral regional blocks, regional intravenous anesthesia (Bier <b>block),</b> <b>local</b> <b>block</b> with sedation, and the recently popularized wide-awake hand surgery depends on several variables, including the type and duration of the procedure and patient characteristics, coexisting conditions, location, and expected length of the procedure.

50|$|In {{compiler}} optimization, register allocation is {{the process}} of assigning a large number of target program variables onto a small number of CPU registers. Register allocation can happen over a basic <b>block</b> (<b>local</b> register allocation), over a whole function/procedure (global register allocation), or across function boundaries traversed via call-graph (interprocedural register allocation). When done per function/procedure the calling convention may require insertion of save/restore around each call-site.|$|R

2500|$|A {{number of}} states in the United States have [...] "preemption clauses" [...] within state law which <b>block</b> <b>local</b> {{communities}} from passing smoke-free ordinances more strict than the state laws on the books. The rationale is to prevent local communities from passing smoke-free ordinances which are viewed as excessive by that state's legislature. Other states have [...] "anti-preemption clauses" [...] that allow local communities to pass smoking ban ordinances that their legislature found unacceptable.|$|R

50|$|Unlike the {{database}} where global variable nodes must fit {{within a database}} <b>block,</b> <b>local</b> variable strings can grow to 1MB. The GT.M run-time provides dynamic storage allocation with garbage collection. The number of local variables {{and the number of}} nodes in local variables are limited only by storage available to the process. The default scope of a local variable is the lifetime of a process. Local variables created within routines using the New command have more limited scope.|$|R
30|$|When it {{does need}} to assign a data block to a remote slot, ECT chooses a <b>block</b> on the <b>local</b> disk of the slot that has the maximum Remaining Local Processing Time (RLPT) to further {{reduce the amount of}} remote processing. The RLPT of a slot is {{calculated}} as the number of unprocessed <b>local</b> <b>blocks</b> times the current local PTE of the slot. For the slot having maximum RLPT, the assignment of its <b>local</b> <b>blocks</b> to remote slots is less likely (compared with other slots) to make it run out of <b>local</b> <b>blocks</b> before the map phase ends, and hence it is less likely this slot would engage in remote processing at a later time.|$|R

50|$|At {{the time}} of this poll it {{remained}} uncertain as to whether Truman or Thurmond would be the official Democratic nominee in Texas. Unlike Oklahoma, Tennessee, North Carolina or Virginia, Texas did not have a major threat from the Republican Party to <b>block</b> <b>local</b> Democratic support for Thurmond, but it had only a third the proportion of blacks found in Mississippi or South Carolina. More critically, Texas’ party hierarchy was dominated by Truman loyalists, most critically Governor Beauford Jester, and by mid-September it was clear that Truman would be the official Democrat nominee.|$|R
30|$|Inguinal {{hernia repair}} is {{commonly}} performed under general anesthesia {{combined with an}} ilioinguinal iliohypogastric nerve (IHN) block. Data are available in which IHN <b>block</b> or <b>local</b> anesthetic infiltration was compared with ultrasound-guided TAP block in patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair. The reports indicate that ultrasound-guided TAP block provided the same or better pain control than IHN <b>block</b> or <b>local</b> anesthetic infiltration after inguinal hernia repair [15, 16]. The positions of the skin incision are nearly identical for inguinal hernia repair and orchiopexy. Thus, we selected TAP block for postoperative analgesia, and we completed this technique safely in the patient.|$|R
