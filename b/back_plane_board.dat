The system includes a <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> having a plurality of plugs corresponding to the pins of the patchboard. A number of decoders {{are connected to the}} plugs of the <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> so that a signal can be sequentially applied to each plug of the <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> under control of a stepping register and a control circuit. A plurality of data selectors are also connected to the plugs of the <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> and under control of a second external register. This control circuit sequentially makes connections between an output circuit and the plugs of the <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> so as to patch the signal applied to a respective plug through a patch connection to the output circuit. The precise locations of the patches on the patchboard can be identified and compared with previously stored information in a memory unit...|$|R

30|$|The {{failure of}} ‘stamp-rock foundation’ system is take place by tensile {{fracture}} {{at the front}} stamp plane and shear fracture or crushing (in the strongly heterogeneous rock) at the back one. In first case the angle between displacement vector and fracture plane is 60 °– 90 ° and in second case it is 30 °– 45 °. The foundation is stiffer the rupture under front plane is more clearly expressed. The typical macrofracture mode is represented in Fig.  8 a. The failure starts at the front (loaded) plane: the rupture fracture (9) is extended under the <b>back</b> <b>plane.</b> The final failure takes place along shear fracture (10) at the <b>back</b> <b>plane.</b> The stress state at the ‘stamp-rock foundation’ system is shown in Fig.  8 d. The calculations shown that under the front plane the “pressure–tension” stress zone and under the <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> the “pressure–pressure” stress zone are formed at the first load steps. In accordance with Mohr criterion [24] the plastic zone is formed at the front plane and extended under <b>back</b> <b>plane.</b> At the loading level of 0.85 from strength the plastic zone occupies the all contact zone (Fig.  8 e). At that the microfractures of the rupture mode are formed within almost all contact area apart from small zone located near the <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> where shear microfractures are formed.|$|R

40|$|Current <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> {{technologies}} such as VME, and current personal computer <b>back</b> <b>planes</b> such as PCI, are shared bus systems that can exhibit nondeterministic latencies. This means a card can {{take control of the}} bus and use resources indefinitely affecting the ability of other cards in the <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> to acquire the bus. This provides a real hit on the reliability of the system. Additionally, these parallel busses only have bandwidths in the 100 s of megahertz range and EMI and noise effects get worse the higher the bandwidth goes. To provide scalable, fault-tolerant, advanced computing systems, more applicable to today s connected computing environment and to better meet the needs of future requirements for advanced space instruments and vehicles, serial back-plane technologies should be implemented in advanced avionics architectures. Serial backplane technologies eliminate the problem of one card getting the bus and never relinquishing it, or one minor problem on the backplane bringing the whole system down. Being serial instead of parallel improves the reliability by reducing many of the signal integrity issues associated with parallel <b>back</b> <b>planes</b> and thus significantly improves reliability. The increased speeds associated with a serial backplane are an added bonus...|$|R

50|$|The SCSI ID of {{a device}} in a drive {{enclosure}} {{that has a}} <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> is set either by jumpers or by the slot in the enclosure the device is installed into, depending {{on the model of}} the enclosure. In the latter case, each slot on the enclosure's <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> delivers control signals to the drive to select a unique SCSI ID. A SCSI enclosure without a <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> often has a switch for each drive to choose the drive's SCSI ID. The enclosure is packaged with connectors that must be plugged into the drive where the jumpers are typically located; the switch emulates the necessary jumpers. While there is no standard that makes this work, drive designers typically set up their jumper headers in a consistent format that matches the way that these switches implement.|$|R

25|$|<b>Planer</b> <b>boards</b> are trolled devices {{designed}} to spread fishing lures out {{away from the}} fishing vessel. They allow multiple lines to be trolled. They come in dual board and inline board designs. Dual board designs consist of two boards that are spaced apart and attached by a line to a mast {{near the front of}} the boat with a separate fishing line in a spring tension release clip that separates when the fishing line is set. Inline boards are attached directly to the fishing line and a spring tension clip that releases upon setting or tripping the <b>planer</b> <b>board</b> so it slides down the fishing line to a swivel tied several feet in front of the lure. Inlines are popular with walleye fishermen. Once tripped they offer much less resistance when reeling in a fish.|$|R

40|$|Scania has {{experienced}} difficulties with large {{variations of the}} slope of the <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> after press quenching of case hardened crown wheels of especially type R 780 Steg supplied from ingot cast material. This leads to {{that a large number of}} crown wheels has to be remeasured and sorted according to back slope which is time consuming for operators. Also, after sorting of the crown wheels, hard machining has to be adjusted according to the different slopes of the <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> of the crown wheels. In some cases, it also leads to scrapping of the crown wheels. This master’s thesis was divided in two parts. The aim of the first part was to confirm that the crown wheel type and casting technique that exhibits the largest variations in slope of the <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> is the R 780 Steg originating from ingot cast material. The crown wheel types that were compared were the R 780 Steg, R 780 Slät and R 885 Slät. Crown wheels manufactured from ingot cast material and from continuous cast material were compared. Hence, 6 combinations were examined. The slope of the <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> was measured with the measuring probe FARO after press quenching. The slope of the crown wheels was found to depend on both casting technique and the geometry of the crown wheel. The results confirmed that the crown wheel type and supplier combination that by far yields the largest variations in slope of the <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> is the R 780 Steg supplied by Steel Plant A who uses the ingot casting technique. For this combination the variation exceeds 0, 1 mm. All other combinations of crown wheels and suppliers yield acceptable variations. The second part of this master’s thesis was composed of determining if segregations in the cast ingot are the cause of the variations in slope of the <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> of the crown wheel type R 780 Steg. This was done by measuring if there is a correlation between {{the slope of the}} <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> of the crown wheel after press quenching, the chemical composition and the original position of the crown wheel in the ingot. As in the first part of the study, the distortion was measured by the measuring probe FARO. The samples were sent to Degerfors Laboratorium for chemical analysis. Analyses of C, S and N were made by using combustion analyses. For As, P, B and Al optic spectrometry (spark) was used. All other elements were analysed by x-ray fluorescence. Segregations were found to be present and in combination with the geometry of R 780 Steg to be the cause of the large variations in slope of the crown wheels. The results of this thesis show that, for the crown wheel type R 780 Steg, Scania should not use suppliers that employ the ingot casting technique. Instead, only suppliers using the continuous casting technique should be used. However, for the other crown wheel types ingot or continuously cast material can be used...|$|R
