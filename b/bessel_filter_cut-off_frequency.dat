This study examined the influence of MPJ axis choice and <b>filter</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> on kinetic variables describing MPJ function during accelerated sprinting. Eight trained sprinters performed maximal sprints along a runway. Three dimensional high-speed (1000 Hz) kinematic and kinetic data were collected at the 20 m point. Three axis definitions for the five MPJs were compared. MPJ moments, powers and energies were calculated using different <b>filter</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The more anatomically appropriate dual axis resulted in less energy absorbed at the MPJ compared to the oblique axis which also absorbed less energy compared to the perpendicular axis. Furthermore, a low <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> (8 Hz) substantially underestimated MPJ kinematics, kinetics and the energy absorbed at the joint and lowered the estimate of energy production during push-off. It is concluded that {{a better understanding of}} MPJ function during sprinting would be obtained by using an oblique or anatomically appropriate representation of the joint together with appropriate kinematic data sampling and filtering so that high frequency movement characteristics are retained...|$|R

Because of its nonparametric character, TE can infer directed information flow also from nonlinear systems. Despite its {{increasing number of}} applications in neuroscience, not much is known regarding the influence of common electrophysiological preprocessing on its estimation. We test the influence of filtering and downsampling on a recently proposed nearest neighborhood based TE estimator. Different filter settings and downsampling factors were tested in a simulation framework using a model with a linear coupling function and two nonlinear models with sigmoid and logistic coupling functions. For nonlinear coupling and progressively lower low-pass <b>filter</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequencies</b> up to 72 % false negative direct connections and up to 26 % false positive connections were identified. In contrast, for the linear model, a monotonic increase was only observed for missed indirect connections (up to 86 %). High-pass filtering (1 Hz, 2 Hz) had no impact on TE estimation. After low-pass filtering interaction delays were significantly underestimated. Downsampling the data by a factor greater than the assumed interaction delay erased most of the transmitted information and thus led to a very high percentage (67 - 100 %) of false negative direct connections. Low-pass filtering increases the number of missed connections depending on the <b>filters</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency.</b> Downsampling should only be done if the sampling factor is smaller than the smallest assumed interaction delay of the analyzed network...|$|R

In case of quasi-periodical signals, applying the TWPF to the individual signal periods leads to an optimal noise reduction. However, the TWPF can also be applied to interv [...] ...|$|R

The frequency {{response of the}} device was measured in the range 300 KHz to 14 GHz at different temperatures, magnetic fields, and dc current values. The microwave loss is most effectively reduced when the Abrikosov vortex lattice spatially matches the underlying washboard pinning landscape. The forward transmission coefficient S_ 21 (f) of the microstrip has a dc-tunable <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> f_d which notably changes under dc bias reversal, due to the two different slope steepnesses of the pinning landscape.

Pre-processing aims at removing the noise components and redundant information. To achieve the same, the recorded instantaneous values of voltage and current in each phase are processed by a second order low pass Butterworth <b>filter</b> (<b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> of 480  Hz).

It is worth mentioning here that, when higher harmonics {{are present in the}} system, the absence of filter warrants the use of a sampler with very high sampling frequency (at least twice the highest harmonic, as per Nyquist criterion) and hence, large memory requirement. Following filtering and sampling, DWT based on multi resolution approach has been utilized to obtain the approximate coefficients of voltage and current waveforms in each phase. As approximate coefficients include low frequency information of 60  Hz, it can be used for fault detection, classification and location estimation task.|$|R
