Prior to the episode's broadcast, Kreuk ignited a minor controversy by noting {{that she would not}} <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> episode when it aired, giving some fans the impression that she was avoiding the show. Kruek released a statement on her Facebook page, clarifying that, even when she was a star on Smallville, she did not watch the episodes when they aired. Kreuk stated that Peterson and Souders never approached her about being in the finale, and that she was glad that they had not, because she was fond of how Lana's story arc ended in season eight.|$|E

The network began experimenting with its late night programming by airing anthology shows like ToonHeads, The Bob Clampett Show, The Tex Avery Show, Late Night Black and White, and O, Canada, which all presented uncensored classic cartoon shorts.

500|$|After {{being dropped}} by Reprise in 1997, L7 was {{interested}} in maintaining an independent, do it yourself approach. Sparks and Gardner explained that the band wanted to release an album in 1999, and if they opted for another major label opportunity, they would certainly {{have to wait until}} 2000 for a release slot. As a result, the band signed a deal with Bong Load Records and formed Wax Tadpole Records, an independent record label named after the first song of their self-titled debut album. Although the band had left the indie music scene before due to distribution problems, Sparks said that she would <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> Bong Load deal to ensure the distribution of Slap-Happy, noting that [...] "there's nothing more painful to tour for a record and the fans not being able to find your record in stores." ...|$|E

[...] Cubitt {{went on to say that}} [...] "mine did everything that the Microsoft one is meant to do, but additionally printed information on toilet paper and didn't use a keyboard for the interface due to hygiene reasons". The i-Loo was prototyped by Cubitt as part of his thesis for his 2001 university degree in Product Design and Engineering at Brunel University. In an interview with The Inquirer, he noted [...] "As it was designed at the university, they own the partial rights to the product so they will <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> Microsoft 'invention' very closely." ...|$|E

500|$|In the episode, Bart {{appears on}} the talk show Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Conan O'Brien was a writer for The Simpsons during the fourth and {{early part of the}} fifth seasons. During the {{production}} of the episode, he received an audition to replace David Letterman as the host of Late Night on NBC, after Letterman defected to CBS. The writers decided that since the episode featured Bart getting famous, it would give them an opportunity to work in O'Brien's show. The part was written just after O'Brien's audition for Late Night, but before he {{knew he was going to}} be the host. O'Brien recorded his part shortly after Late Night with Conan O'Brien premiered, but he believed NBC would have fired him before the episode aired. He described being a guest star on the show as [...] "really delightful", adding that [...] "it's like being frozen in amber.

500|$|Roy Scheider reluctantly {{returned}} to reprise {{his role as}} Martin Brody. In 1977, he had quit the role of Michael Vronsky in The Deer Hunter {{two weeks before the}} start of filming because of [...] "creative differences". Scheider was contracted to Universal at the time for a three-picture deal, but the studio offered to forgive his failure to fulfill his contractual obligation if he agreed to appear in Jaws 2. The actor heavily resisted the film, claiming that there was nothing new to create and that people would <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> film to see the shark, not him. According to his biographer, Scheider was so desperate to be relieved from the role that he [...] "pleaded insanity and went crazy in The Beverly Hills Hotel". However, he was given an attractive financial package for appearing in Jaws 2; he quadrupled his base salary from the first film, and negotiated points (a percentage of the film's net profits). The Star newspaper reported that Scheider received $500,000 for 12 weeks work, plus $35,000 for each additional week that the schedule ran over.|$|E
500|$|Returning home, the Griffin {{family are}} shown to <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> {{syndicated}} talk show The Ellen DeGeneres Show with actress and comedian Ellen DeGeneres appearing {{as host of}} the show. Lois then interrupts the family, and announces that she is going out to drink with Joyce. The two then share their darkest secrets, with Lois revealing that she {{had participated in the}} making of a pornographic film. Asked if the film still exists, Lois states that it is [...] "long gone," [...] just like the original ending to the 1978 musical film Grease. After Joyce shows the film on the local news, Lois becomes angered, and decides to confront Joyce, who reveals that Lois had tormented her during high school, under the name Joyce Chevapravatdumrong, a reference to the Family Guy writer and series producer Cherry Chevapravatdumrong. The scene then transitions into a Facebook cutaway gag, showing Lois's Facebook profile. Becoming depressed once she is kicked out of her church, Lois is confronted by Brian, who suggest that she take the criticism head on, giving the example of television host Ryan Seacrest taking on jokes about his alleged homosexuality.|$|E
500|$|On July 11, 2008, Shinoda's second {{public art}} show [...] "Glorious Excess (BORN)" [...] premiered at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles.

The show served as part {{one of the}} two-part [...] "Glorious Excess" [...] series, with the second installment [...] "Glorious Excess (DIES)" [...] due at JANM on August 22, 2009. Shinoda commented on the inspiration behind the Glorious Excess series, stating, [...] "It Got {{to a point where}} the pervasiveness of 'celebrity news' concerned me. It seemed like it has jumped out of its niche into places where it doesn't belong. I would <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> news, and thinking, 'of all the things {{going on in the world}} right now, why are they covering so-and-so's breakup?' It didn't make sense to me. Add to that the fact that I'm supposed to somehow 'belong' to that celebrity group—and I really don't feel like I do in a lot of ways—and you can see how the topic started to become really interesting to me. The Glorious Excess (BORN) show was my way of diving into those topics, trying to find answers. It follows a central 'celebrity' character, who is filthy rich, slightly violent, and famous without any particular skill or talent." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 3 out of 4 stars, praising it as [...] "a skillfully {{assembled}} 130minutes at the movies, with actors {{capable of doing}} absurd things with straight faces, and action sequences that toy idly with the laws of physics", while Richard Corliss of Time considered it [...] "maybe the first great film of the post-human era". The New York Times said it deftly combined action and humor, stating [...] "The only time you won't <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> screen is when your eyes have squeezed shut because you're laughing so hard." [...] The Telegraph appreciated the presence of Johnson and Diesel together, calling it a [...] "cosmic event", and added that director Lin had revitalized the series, saying [...] "the start and finish here, defying every imaginable law of physics, are series highs." [...] Empire also heaped praise on Johnson, saying [...] "How to re-ignite an ageing franchise? Drop [...] on it. The best thing, by far, in Fast Five ... Dwayne Johnson hulks through the movie leaving testosterone trails in his wake." [...] However, Empire took {{the view that the}} film itself was [...] "not, by any normal criteria, a good film", arguing that it was too long, although conceding that the action scenes, in particular the final car chase, made the film [...] "the most entertaining in the series." [...] Anna Smith of Time Out London also commented that the film was too long and criticized the simplistic characters and dialog, but she called the film [...] "slick" [...] and stated that these criticisms could be overlooked because [...] "it doesn't take itself too seriously." [...] Variety focused on the roles of Johnson and Diesel, lamenting the current lack of 1980s-style [...] "brawny" [...] leading men and of the [...] "manly men" [...] typical of the 1950s and 1960s, and calling their pairing [...] "a welcome injection of tough-guy vigor". Variety commented that, based on Fast Five, a [...] "sixth entry could be something worth waiting for". The New Yorker called the action scenes [...] "spectacular", praising director Lin by saying his [...] "direction and the sharp editing never confuse or lose momentum", but also found the film too long and criticized the dialog, labeling it [...] "subpar [...] Ocean's Eleven-style banter". [...] On the characters, The New Yorker considered Walker and Diesel [...] "serviceable", but singled out Johnson for praise for bringing a [...] "hip, comic knowingness to his role ... his enjoyment is infectious and keeps the movie speeding along." ...|$|E
