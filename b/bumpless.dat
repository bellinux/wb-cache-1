40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} a new {{approach}} to <b>bumpless</b> transfer for system reconfiguration at runtime. During a system reconfiguration an operating point change, a change of controller parameters or even a change of the control structure can occur. After the definition of requirements which has to be fulfilled during the reconfiguration, a new flatness-based method for <b>bumpless</b> transfer is presented. The flatness-based method draws on the two-degrees-of-freedom control structure and on the (differential) flatness which is a fundamental feature of the controlled system. <b>Bumpless</b> switching is realised by means of feedforward and reference trajectories computed in real time which are applicable with linear and non-linear SISO and MIMO systems. The new method of <b>bumpless</b> switching is compared to existing bumpless-switching procedures and its advantages are evidenced by practical examples...|$|E

This notion of conditioned transfer is different from the notion of <b>bumpless</b> transfer which refers to the requirement that no bump occurs at the plant input when switching between different controllers.

40|$|We {{present a}} unified {{framework}} {{for the study of}} linear time-invariant (LTI) systems subject to control input nonlinearities. The framework is based on the following two-step design paradigm: "Design the linear controller ignoring control input nonlinearities and then add anti-windup <b>bumpless</b> transfer (AWBT) compensation to minimize the adverse eflects of any control input nonlinearities on closed loop performance". The resulting AWBT compensation is applicable to multivariable controllers of arbitrary structure and order. All known LTI anti-windup and/or <b>bumpless</b> transfer compensation schemes are shown to be special cases of this framework. It is shown how this framework can handle standard issues such as the analysis of stability and performance with or without uncertainties in the plant model.

The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated via a simple simulation. The result demonstrates that a time-windowed/fading-memory cost function for unfalsified control is useful for adaptive control system with time-varying plants, even when the plant fails to satisfy the usual 'feasibility' requirement of unfalsified control that it must bestabilizable by at least one of the candidate controllers...|$|E

This loop is not activated in fault-free situation. Moreover, in order to decrease undesired bumps caused by the activation of FTC loop, the problem of <b>bumpless</b> transfer is posed within linear quadratic context.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the results of a joint academic and industrial study on the development of a detailed nonlinear dynamic model of a turbofan jet engine to be used for research into advanced control strategies for civil turbofan aircraft engines. The model is representative of a dual shaft engine with variable bleed, variable stator vanes, turbine cooling, heat transfer, and a duct and exhaust nozzle. A switched, gain-scheduled, feedback control system incorporating <b>bumpless</b> transfer and antiwindup functionality has been designed and implemented according to current industrial practice. This baseline implementation permits realistic transient operation of the simulation and may act as a reference design for further control work. The simulation computes a non-iterative solution, by progressing calculations {{in the direction of the}} gas stream flow. Where possible the underlying physics are used and empirical approximations are avoided so that the model requires minimum data. This approach also makes a future inclusion of component failure easier to implement. The simulation is modular in nature so that engine or control modules can be easily replaced or modified if an improved design becomes available. The Simulink implementation of the control architecture has been redesigned to permit the addition or removal of control loops, also during the simulation’s operation, to allow testing of advanced control strategies. The entire controller can also be easily replaced. A detailed description of the modeling process, the various simulation issues that arise with a model of this complexity, and the results of the overall aero-engine system are presented. The design of the switched, gain-scheduled aero-engine controller with <b>bumpless</b> transfer and antiwindup which achieves dynamic performance that closely matches that of a real aero-engine is also discussed.

40|$|The novel {{contribution}} of the thesis is the design and implementation of decentralised output feedback power system controllers for power oscillation damping (POD) over the entire operating regime of the power system. The POD controllers are designed for the linearised models of the nonlinear power system dynamics. The linearised models are combined and treated as parameter varying switched systems. The thesis contains novel results for the controller design, <b>bumpless</b> switching and stability analysis of such switched systems. Use of switched controllers against the present trend of having single controller helps to reduce the conservatism and to increase the uncertainty handling capability of the power system controller design. Minimax-LQG control design method {{is used for the}} controller design. Minimax-LQG control combines the advantages of both LQG and H control methods with respect to robustness and the inclusion of uncertainty and noise in the controller design. Also, minimax-LQG control allows the use of multiple integral quadratic constraints to bound the different types of uncertainties in the power system application. During switching between controllers, switching stability of the system is guaranteed by constraining the minimum time between two consecutive switchings. An expression is developed to compute the minimum time required between switchings including the effect of jumps in the states. <b>Bumpless</b> switching scheme is used to minimise the switching transients which occur when the controllers are switched. Another {{contribution of}} the thesis is to include the effect of on load tap changing transformers in the power system controller design. A simplified power system model linking generator and tap changing transformer dynamics is developed for this purpose and included in the controller design.
