40|$|Experiments {{into the}} {{relationship}} between diet and health have been an area of high interest for a long time. In this study, we investigate the application of multivariate data analysis to differentiate between rat populations fed on two different diets: normal rat diet (control) and Western affluent diet (WAD). Two sets of data were acquired and analysed: one from a <b>biochemical</b> clinical <b>analyser,</b> taking measurements of blood-based biochemical markers; the other from {{the analysis of the}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from faecal samples from the same animals using selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS). Five classes were considered: weanlings, 12 month controls, 12 month WADs, 18 month controls, and 18 month WADs. Data from the <b>biochemical</b> <b>analyser,</b> weanlings and 18 month WAD fed rats showed significant differences from the other measurement classes. This was shown in both the exploratory analysis and through multivariate classification. Classification of control diet versus WAD diets suggested there are differences between classes with 92 % accuracy for the 12 month classes and 91 % for the 18 month classes. Cholesterol markers, especially as low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL), were the main factor in influencing WAD samples. The data from the SIFT-MS analysis also produced very good classification accuracies. Classification of control diet versus WAD diets using the H 3 O+ precursor ion data suggested there are differences between classes with 71 % accuracy for the 12 month classes and 100 % for the 18 month classes. These findings confirm that total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol are elevated in the 18 month WAD-fed rats. We therefore suggest that the analysis of VOCs from faecal samples in conjunction with multivariate data analysis may be a useful alternative to blood analysis for the detection of parameters of health...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAimPotent {{risk factors}} at both genetic and non-genetic levels are {{accountable}} for susceptibility and instigation of different cardiovascular phenotypes. Recently, homocysteine is being {{identified as an}} important predictor for cardiovascular diseases. Homocysteine remethylation {{plays a key role}} in the synthesis of methionine and S-adenosine methionine. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methionine synthase (MTR) genes are known to regulate the homocysteine remethylation reaction and higher homocysteine level is significantly associated with diverse cardiovascular phenotypes. In this context, we aimed to carry out a study on the association of MTHFR (C 677 T) and MTR (A 2756 G) gene polymorphism with CVD in population of Jammu region of J&K state. Materials and methodsA total of 435 individuals were enrolled (195 CVD patients and 240 controls) for the case–control study. Genotyping of MTHFR C 677 T and MTR A 2756 G gene polymorphism was done by PCR-RFLP technique. Biochemical parameters were estimated by <b>biochemical</b> <b>analyser.</b> ResultsMetabolic variables such as serum LDL-C, TC and TG were significantly higher in patients (p< 0. 0001), whereas serum HDL-C was higher in controls. Majority of the patients were having history of hypertension (57. 44 %; p< 0. 0001) as a concomitant condition. The evaluation of genetic association showed that, MTHFR C 6877 T (OR: 8. 89, 95 % CI: 2. 01 – 39. 40) and MTR A 2756 G (OR: 1. 48, 95 % CI: 1. 09 – 2. 00) polymorphisms associated with higher risk of CVD. ConclusionThe present study reveals significant differences in nongenetic variables among patients and control as well as association of gene polymorphisms with CVD risk...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} a typical reference range for the population of athletes. Results of blood tests of 339 athletes (82 women and 257 men, aged 18 - 37 years) were retrospectively analysed. The subjects were representatives of different sports disciplines. The measurements of total bilirubin (BIT), iron (Fe), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) were made using a Pentra 400 <b>biochemical</b> <b>analyser</b> (Horiba, France). Red blood cell count (RBC), reticulocyte count and haemoglobin concentration measurements were made using an Advia 120 haematology analyser (Siemens, Germany). In groups of women and men the percentage of elevated results were similar at 18 %. Most results of total bilirubin in both sexes were in the range 7 - 14 μmol ∙ L- 1 (49 % of women and 42 % of men). The highest results of elevated levels of BIT were in the range 21 - 28 μmol ∙ L- 1 (12 % of women and 11 % of men). There was a significant correlation between serum iron and BIT concentration in female and male athletes whose serum total bilirubin concentration does not exceed the upper limit of the reference range. Elevated concentrations of total bilirubin appear to be due to changes caused by regular exercise. The obtained upper limit of the reference range for total bilirubin concentration in the group of athletes is 29. 0 μmol ∙ L- 1. It seems reasonable to use dedicated reference values for total bilirubin concentration in relation to the group of athletes...|$|R

40|$|A type of {{monoclonal}} antibody (MAb) {{has been developed}} to diagnose Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH). This disease is due to gene effect that causes overproducing of androgen and can cause high mortality of new-born. In {{order to reduce the}} death rate of new-born’s due to this disease, large amount of research have been done to produce antibody that can helping the detection of this disease. This research will like to investigate on the hybridoma cells requirement of glucose and glutamine for growth rate and also the effect of the by-products to the growth rate of the cell. Previous study showed that the researcher uses a glucose and glutamine concentration from 2. 7 – 24 mM and 4 – 12 mM batch culture. The glucose and glutamine concentration used in this research were varied from 4 – 6 mM and 4 – 5. 5 mM respectively. Growth, metabolites consumption (glucose and glutamine) and waste production (lactate and ammonia) were monitored. At the end of this research, the cell growth curve and the specific growth (μ) of each cell culture was determined with the effect of glucose and glutamine as well as lactate and ammonia to the growth of this hybridoma cell. From the results, the maximum cell density achieved at the lowest concentration of glucose and glutamine (4 mM) was 7. 85 × 105 cells/mL, whereas for the highest was 13. 15 × 105 cells/mL. From these results, it shows that low glucose and glutamine concentration could also be sufficient enough to achieve a good and stable growth of hybridoma cell. The maximum μ of 0. 2026 h- 1 was achieved in a medium containing 6 mM glucose and 5. 5 mM glutamine. The glutamine was found {{to play a major role}} in the cell growth where it also affects the specific growth rate of the hybridoma cell. The metabolites were determined using YSL <b>biochemical</b> <b>analyser,</b> where it detects glucose, glutamine, lactate and ammonia. Due to equipment breakdown and insufficient time, the ammonia needs to be skipped. The glucose concentration of 6 mM in the culture produces maximum concentration of lactate at 10. 1 mM. The data obtained for ɋglucose, ɋglutamine and ɋlactate was highest at the highest glucose and glutamine concentration (6 mM and 5. 5 mM) where ɋglucose and ɋglutamine were consumed and ɋlactate was produced the most. The glucose (ɋglucose) consumed was - 0. 0020 nmol/ 106 cells. hr, glutamine (ɋglutamine) consumed was at - 0. 0018 nmol/ 106 cells. hr and lactate produced of 0. 58 nmol/ 106 cells. hr. This shows that the feeding of high glucose was not suitable due to high lactate was produced. Thus, the best low concentration to be used for feeding the hybridoma cell was for glucose concentration of 4 mM and glutamine concentration of 5. 5 mM. The result from the experiment shows that at lower glucose concentration, the specific production rate of lactate will decrease as the glutamine concentration increases.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to assess the}} {{long-term}} effect of excessive iodine intake on thyroid activity and selected immunological, haematological and biochemical parameters in blood of ewes and their lambs. The experiment was conducted from August 2009 to February 2010 in an experimental barn of Faculty of Agriculture, University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice. Into the experiment were used Šumava sheep breed ewes and their born lambs. Group A (control) consisted of 6 ewes after lambing was extended to 7 born lambs, group B (experimental) 6 of 6 ewes and lambs. Lambs were put into the experiment from the 1 st to the 60 th day after birth and received iodine in the milk of their mothers. Iodine supplementation to the diet of ewes was launched during the first to second months of pregnancy and finished 60 days after birth. During the experiment, a group of ewes A received 3, 1 and group B 5, 1 mg iodine per kg of dietary dry matter in the form of calcium iodate. During the experiment was regularly collected blood of ewes (before lambing and 1 st, 10 th, 30 th and 60 th day after birth) and lambs (1 st, 3 rd, 10 th, 30 th and 60 th day after birth) to determine the concentration of thyroid stimulating hormone and immunoglobulin G (ELISA) in blood serum, thyroid hormones (RIA), total protein, urea and alkaline phosphatase activity in the blood plasma (<b>biochemical</b> <b>analyser),</b> the content of haemoglobin, white blood cell´s and red blood cell´s counts and haematocrit values in blood (haematological analyser), percentage of albumin, - 1 -globulins, - 2 -globulins, -globulins, and -globulins in blood serum (electrophoresis) and the content of iodine in the blood plasma, urine and milk of ewes (colorimetric method Sandell-Kolthoff). During the experiment were not observed in ewes and lambs clinical symptoms associated with an excessive intake of iodine. In experimental group of ewes with iodine intake 5, 1 mg/kg of dietary dry matter were found higher values of thyroid stimulating hormone, lower values of free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, IgG, white blood cells, - 1 -globulins, - 2 -globulin and -globulin, significantly lower values of -globulins after parturition, significantly higher values of urea and alkaline phosphatase activity. The iodine content in blood plasma, milk and urine of ewes is increased in direct proportion to its concentration in diet. Lambs of mothers with iodine intake of 5, 1 mg/kg of dietary dry matter were significantly higher values of thyroid stimulating hormone from the 10 th day after birth, significantly lower values of free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine first day after birth, immunoglobulin G and -globulins in 30 th day after birth, lower (statistically significant in middle samples) values of total protein and white blood cells, higher values of urea and alkaline phosphatase activity. The weight gains of lambs were not significantly affected by iodine supplementation. These results in ewes with iodine intake of 5, 1 mg/kg dietary dry matter and especially their lambs drawn to risk of reduce the activity of the thyroid gland and the negative impact of parameters of humoral immunity, mainly IgG and -globulins...|$|R
40|$|Background: A case of Crimean-Congo {{haemorrhagic}} fever (CCHF) was imported into Scotland in 2012. Aim: To discuss {{the public health}} response to the case, and the control measures taken to prevent secondary transmission. Methods: Following confirmation of the case, an incident management team (IMT) was convened to ensure that: (i) all individuals exposed to the case and/or their blood/body fluids were identified, assessed and followed-up appropriately; and (ii) the appropriate disinfection or disposal of equipment was used to manage the patient, laboratory specimens obtained from the case, and their environment. Findings: Contact tracing identified 19 individuals who required follow-up and monitoring. No secondary cases occurred. Identification of laboratory specimens obtained prior to diagnosis proved challenging. The majority were traced, temporarily stored in sharps boxes and subsequently incinerated. A small number could not be recovered and consequently would have been disposed of through the routine hospital waste system. <b>Biochemical</b> and haematology <b>analysers</b> were decontaminated according to the manufacturers' instructions and liquid waste was discharged to drains. The patient's mattress, sphygmomanometer and pulse oximeter probe were incinerated. Decontamination of the clinical environment was undertaken following guidance from national experts. Conclusions: While national guidance {{for the management of}} cases of viral {{haemorrhagic fever}} (VHF) available at the time in the UK informed the approach taken to manage the risk of secondary transmission, a number of practical issues relating to infection control aspects of managing a patient with VHF in a non-high-level isolation unit environment were encountered.
