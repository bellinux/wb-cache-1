5|$|Among the key {{indicators}} of Christianisation are long-cist cemeteries that generally indicate Christian burials {{due to their}} East-West orientation, although this correlation has been challenged by recent research. These burials are found <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the Roman era and the 7th century, after which point they become rarer. They are concentrated strongly in eastern Scotland south of the Tay, in Angus, the Mearns, Lothian and the Borders. It is generally accepted among scholars that place-name element eccles-, from the Brythonic word for church, represents evidence of the British church of the Roman and immediate post-Roman period, {{most of which are}} located in the south-west, south and east. About a dozen inscribed stones of the 5th and 6th centuries, beginning with the so-called Latinus stone of Whithorn, dating to c. 450, indicate Christianity through their dedications and are spread across southern Scotland.|$|E

Despite Kassian surpassing his goal total from his rookie season, the Sedins started the year with their lowest output in nearly ten years, combining for 14 {{points in the first}} 10 games. Coinciding with the line changes, Vancouver went on a six-game winning streak <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of January and their February 12 game.

5|$|<b>Between</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (May 1943) and {{beginning}} of 1944, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Jews {{hiding in the}} Ghetto ruins. The number of Robinsons after the Warsaw Uprising has been estimated at between several hundred and two thousand, spread across all the suburbs of Warsaw. Another source gives the number as between 400 and 1,000. Most of those hiding were Jewish, including some {{who had been in}} hiding since the fall of the ghetto uprising, though a significant number were non-Jewish Poles. Unlike Szpilman, whose case was somewhat unrepresentative, most of those in hiding remained in medium-sized to large groups, often of mixed ethnicities. The majority of the Robinsons were men.|$|E
5|$|Both North Carolina and Washington, {{designed}} {{prior to}} radar, were originally fitted with many fire-control and navigational optical range-finders.

The range-finders were removed in favor of additional 20mm guns sometime <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of 1941 and mid-1942.

5|$|Education {{in early}} modern Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} education within the modern borders of Scotland, <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the Middle Ages in the late fifteenth century and {{the beginnings of the}} Enlightenment in the mid-eighteenth century. By the sixteenth century such formal educational institutions as grammar schools, petty schools and sewing schools for girls were established in Scotland, while children of the nobility often studied under private tutors. Scotland had three universities, but the curriculum was limited and Scottish scholars had to go abroad to gain second degrees. These contacts were {{one of the most important}} ways in which the new ideas of Humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life. Humanist concern with education and Latin culminated in the Education Act 1496.|$|E

40|$|A single {{truncated}} {{chromosome fragment}} (TCF) in diploid cells undergoes frequent ectopic recombination during meiosis between markers located near <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of <b>the</b> fragment. Tetrads produced by diploids {{with a single}} TCF show frequent loss {{of one of the}} two markers. This marker loss could result either from recombination of the TCF with one of the two copies of the chromosome from which it was derived or from ectopic recombination <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of <b>the</b> TCF. The former would result in shortening of a normal chromosome and lethality in one of the four spores. The high frequency of marker loss in tetrads with four viable spores supports recombination <b>between</b> <b>the</b> TCF <b>ends</b> as <b>the</b> main source of marker loss. Most of the spore colonies that display TCF marker loss contained a TCF with the same marker on both ends. Deletion of most of the pBR 322 sequences distal to the marker at one of the subtelomeric regions of the TCF did not reduce the overall frequency of recombination <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends,</b> but affected <b>the</b> loss of one marker significantly more than the other. We suggest that the mechanism by which the duplication of one end marker and loss of the other occurs is based on association and recombination <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of <b>the</b> TCF...|$|R

In June 1913, Amalfi escorted King Victor Emmanuel III and his wife, Queen Elena, on the royal yacht Trinacria to the annual regatta at Kiel, Germany. While there, Victor Emmanuel met with Kaiser Wilhelm II, to discuss—it was speculated in a contemporary news report—the ongoing Balkan War. After departing from Kiel, Amalfi escorted the King and Queen on Trinacria to their next stop at Stockholm.|$|E

In the early medieval period, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex struggled for control over North West England, along with the Britons and the Danes. Whatever its earlier use, the ditch has been used as a boundary since at least the Middle Ages.|$|E
