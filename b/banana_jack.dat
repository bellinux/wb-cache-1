40|$|Break-out boxes (BOBs) are {{necessary}} for all electrical integration/cable checkouts and troubleshooting. Because {{the price of a}} BOB is high, and no work can be done without one, often the procedure stops, simply waiting for a BOB. A less expensive BOB would take less time in the integration, testing, and troubleshooting process. The PCB-based BOB works and looks the same as a standard JPL BOB, called Gold Boxes. The only differences between the old BOB and the new PCB-based BOB is that the new one has 80 percent of its circuitry in a printed circuit board. This process reduces the time for fabrication, thus making the BOBs less expensive. Moreover, because of its unique design, the new BOBs can be easily assembled and fixed. About 80 percent of the new PCB-based BOB is in a $ 22 (at the time of this reporting) custom-designed, yet commercially available PCB. This device has been used successfully to verify that BOB cables were properly made. Also, upon completion, the BOB was beeped out via a multimeter to ensure that all sockets on the connectors were properly connected to the respective <b>banana</b> <b>jack.</b> When compared to the Gold Box BOBs, the new BOB has many advantages. It is much more cost efficient, it delivers equal usability at substantially lower cost of the BOB, and the Gold Box is much heavier when compared to the new BOB. The new BOB is also a bit longer and much more versatile in that connectors are easily changeable and if a <b>banana</b> <b>jack</b> is broken, it can be replaced instead of throwing away an entire BOB...|$|E

40|$|The Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) Simulator is a {{portable}} training aid, or demonstration tool, designed to physically illustrate real-time critical-safety concepts of electrical lockout/tagout. The {{objective is to}} prevent misinterpretations of what is off and what is on during maintenance and repair of complex electrical systems. The simulator is designed {{in the form of}} a hinged box that opens up and stands on its own as an easel for demonstrations. On the outer face of the unit is a simulated circuit breaker box housing the switches. The breakers control the main power to the unit, a light bulb, and an electrical control cabinet. The light bulb is wired so that either of two breakers can provide power to it. When power is sent to the electrical control cabinet, a red indicator light illuminates. Inside the cabinet is the power supply from a personal computer. The power supply produces a 12 -V dc output that is sent over to a small fan next to it, also from a computer, and an amber light on the front of the cabinet illuminates. A separate switch powers the fan on and off. The power supply is behind a plastic shield to protect against exposure to live conductors. Electrical <b>banana</b> <b>jacks</b> are mounted in the plastic shield to allow a voltmeter to be connected safely when opening the cabinet and taking a meter reading to verify de-energization as part of a simulation exercise. This LOTO simulator prototype is designed and fabricated as an all-in-one unit. All accessories can be stored inside the hinged case, and there is a handle on top for ease of transport. The circuit breaker labels attach with hook and loop fasteners so that they may be moved and changed to fit the training or demonstration scenario. The warning signs and labels on the electrical control box are magnetic, allowing for easy reconfiguration to emulate different equipment setups. A specially designed magnetic cover was made to disguise the indicator lights for demonstrations when these indicators are not used. The cover is disguised as an arc flash safety label that would typically be found on such a cabinet. One indicator light has a separate switch that can take it offline. This is to allow for demonstration to trainees on why it is important not to completely rely on indicator lights, but that they should always take a meter reading at the exposed conductors to absolutely verify de-energization before exposure. A clear plastic barrier and <b>banana</b> <b>jacks</b> inside the cabinet provide a safe way to plug in a voltmeter for demonstrations without exposure to the hazards of energized equipment. A small remote control unit is wired into the fan circuit. The remote allows the demonstrator to turn the fan on and off, provided that all of the breakers and switches leading to it are configured on as well. The remote feature was added in order to demonstrate the importance of starting the lockout/tagout task with energized equipment, then powering it down, isolating it, and locking it out to ensure that the correct breakers have been locked out...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 A {{design for}} an x-ray machine {{to be used}} as a visual aid for the {{instruction}} of x-ray theory and x-ray machine operation has been presented. From this design an x-ray machine was constructed and tested. Components used in an x-ray machine have been divided in to three sections; a component is included in one of the three sections depending on its function in the x-ray circuit. The three sections are Control Section 1, Control Section 2, and Generator Section. The circuit schematic used was divided into the three sections, drawn on poster board, and attached to the front of three display panels. Each poster board was covered with a sheet of one-eighth inch Plexiglass to provide mechanical and electrical protection to the poster board. The components were mounted on the reverse side of the three display panels behind their locations in the circuit schematic. Components were not permanently wired into one circuit, but were wired to <b>banana</b> <b>jacks.</b> Connection into a circuit was made by using patch cords with banana plugs on each end. This allows the wiring of one of several circuits by the instructor. The x-ray tube has been mounted in a box having one-thirty-second inch lead sheet on five sides to shield against scattered radiation. The primary beam has been shielded using one-quarter inch thick plate glass. Use of plate glass allows direct viewing of the x-ray tube. The operating kVp has been reduced from 76 kVp to 22 kVp by placing a 3 : 1 step-down transformer ahead of the primary of the high-tension transformer. This reduction of the kVp makes the use of plate glass to shield the primary beam feasible. It also allows the use of 1 X 2 B vacuum tubes to rectify the kilovoltage. The exposure rate at the surface of the plate glass is less than 0. 1 mR/hr at 22 kVp and 6 mA, the maximum operating kVp and mA of the x-ray machine. Leakage along the sides of the tube housing was also less than 0. 1 mR/hr at the maximum kVp and mA...|$|R

40|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} are damaged due to inappropriate methods of picking, packing, Storage and transportation. They perish during this process. Insufficient information Flow is another major handicap. Therefore {{it is very important}} to study the whole Supply chain and find out the necessary remedies in order to develop Sri Lankan fruit and vegetable industry. The main objective of this research is to study the whole supply chain of fruit & Vegetable industry, to identify the weak links of the supply chain and to identify the Improvements in order to maximize profit for the growers and minimize cost to the consumer. This research is also aimed to identify the extent of fruit {{and vegetables}} damaged by The methods of wrong handling, storage and packaging. And also to identify the gaps and necessary improvements for fruit & vegetables supply chain using the Supply Chain Operation Reference model (SCOR). The major component of this research is mapping the total supply chain thread for Fruit and vegetable industry in Sri Lanka in order to fulfill all the objectives. This Research targets few selected fruits and vegetables and map the supply chain threads. Mapping the supply chain threads for <b>banana,</b> lime, papaya, <b>jack</b> fruit and tomato Were mammoth tasks. Each fruit and vegetable has different supply chain thread Depending on the geographical and climate conditions, these threads change. Total damage and perishing of fruits and vegetables in the supply chain depend on the supply chain thread and also it varies according to the method of handling, packing and transport. By selecting papaya supply chain thread: farmer - truck buyer - retailer- consumer, the percentage damage was analyzed, by wrapping in papers and packing in boxes gave different percentage damages. If plastic crates are introduced thus minimizing or eliminating damages in total supply chain, it can recover the initial investment within one and half months. If the initial investment was done by the truck buyer they have to wait for four and half months to recover the initial investment and this is on the assumption that the truck buyer can charge additional 50 cents per kilogram if they use plastic crates as method of packing. Due. to reluctance of the chain partners to invest, there should be some financial incentives to initiate this packing method and it will result in significant benefits to the total supply chain. After mapping the supply chain for papaya, <b>banana,</b> lime, <b>jack</b> fruit and tomato as at present, and by studying the supply chain in best performing sector and super markets, the main component missing is Plan Supply Chain (PI). Plan Source (P 2), Plan Make (P 3),Plan Deliver (P 4) are there to some extent in the chain partners but Planning Supply Chain as a whole (PI) is absent. Decoupling Point (DP) in Sri Lankan super market sector is at the distribution center and for other chains DP is at the retailers that are close to the consumer. Chain members were found to take considerable time to move their inventory. This is the cause for a large percentage perishing, since this fruit and vegetable life time is short and if this time period is not managed properly it will cause problems. Integrated collection and transportation system to plan and manage by central unit is the answer, and then it could be arranged for daily collection and distribution network. In banana and papaya supply chain, wholesalers' role is relatively small and because of their handling time of extra two days, it causes an increase in the percentage of perishing and damage, adding further cost to consumer. If in the supply chain, truck buyers directly deal with the retailer, this damage percentage can be reduced and can also reduce transportation cost. Since individual retailers at present make arrangements of transportation which is costly, it is preferred for the truck buyer to develop integrated distribution network. This will reduce the transportation costs to a great extent. In all supply chains, the maximum profit margin is kept by the retailers. Then comes the wholesalers own high profit margins. Farmers take higher profit once they sell their products to the consumer at the fair, but quantity involved in this chain is comparatively low. Transportation and overheads cost component of the supermarket supply chain is comparatively high and the cost due to damage is low compared to the other supply chains. However since supermarket supply chain manages quality of the fruit and vegetable, consumers who enjoy high living standard are willing to buy from them and pay an additional amount. When analyzing the price breakdown for supply chain threads for fruits and vegetables in this research, the maximum portion was found to be the profit component, second came costs due to damage/ perishing and thirdly basic production cost. Around one fifth portion is only the amount for the cost of production for these 'fruit and vegetable items and the balance part of what the consumer pays consists of the profit, cost due to damage, transportation cost, packaging cost, loading unloading cost and overheads...|$|R
