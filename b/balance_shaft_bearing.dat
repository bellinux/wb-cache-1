With a forced lubrication system (invented by Frederick Lanchester), oil is picked up by a positive displacement oil pump and forced through oil galleries (passageways) into bearings, such as the main bearings, big end bearings and camshaft <b>bearings</b> or <b>balance</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>bearings.</b> Other components such as cam lobes and cylinder walls are lubricated by oil jets.|$|R

40|$|The {{equations}} {{of motion}} for the major components in an internalcombustion engine are developed herein using a recursive formulation. These components include the (rigid) engine block, pistons, connectingrods, (flexible) crankshaft, <b>balance</b> <b>shafts,</b> main <b>bearings,</b> and enginemounts. Relative coordinates are employed that automatically satisfy allconstraints and therefore lead to the minimum set of ordinarydifferential {{equations of motion}}. The derivation of the equations ofmotion is automated {{through the use of}} computer algebra as the precursorto automatically generating the computational (C or Fortran) subroutinesfor numerical integration. The entire automated procedure forms thebasis for an engine modeling template that may be used to supportthe up-front design of engines for noise and vibration targets. This procedure is demonstrated on an example engine under free(idealized) and firing conditions and the predicted engine responses arecompared with results from an ADAMS model. Results obtained by usingdifferent bearing models, including linear, nonlinear, and hydrodynamicbearing models, are discussed in detail...|$|R

50|$|The V10 is {{essentially}} the result of mating two even-firing straight-5 engines together. The straight-5 engine shows first and second order rocking motion. Here it should be assumed that the crankshaft with low second-order vibration is used and the first order is balanced by a <b>balance</b> <b>shaft.</b> By mating the straight-5 banks at 90 degrees and using five throws, the <b>balance</b> <b>shafts</b> <b>balance</b> each other and become null. The firing sequence is odd (BMW S85, Dodge Viper, Volkswagen Touareg). Using an 18° split journal crankshaft the firing order can be made even, and the two <b>balanced</b> <b>shafts</b> do not <b>balance</b> each other completely, but are combined into a single very small <b>balance</b> <b>shaft</b> (Lamborghini V10, Porsche Carrera GT).

50|$|Although a {{powerful}} engine for its time, the 16 Valve engine can experience some {{problems that can}} be solved easily. One of the few problems is oil pump gear problems leading to broken timing belts. The oil pump gear itself can fail around the mounting flange, or, more often, the weak 8.8(grade 5) grade bolt holding the gear can break. It is strongly recommended to use a 10.9 (grade 8) grade bolt when replacing the oil pump gear. Another cause for timing belt failure is improperly adjusting the timing belt on engines with a manual tensioner (1989 to very early 1990 models only) or improperly adjusting the <b>balance</b> <b>shaft</b> belt. Because this is an interference engine, damage will occur if the timing belt fails. Another common occurrence is that the <b>balance</b> <b>shaft's</b> oil seals are prone to leak on older engines. New replacement sealings tend to start leaking again due to 'worn in irregularities' on the shaft itself. Many people have removed the <b>balance</b> <b>shaft</b> belt or the <b>balance</b> <b>shaft</b> assemblies altogether to prevent belt failure and/or leakage. The <b>balance</b> <b>shafts</b> are only there to lessen high rpm second order vibrations, and removing them will only affect high rpm vibrations. Once all the common problems are solved, the 16 Valve engines are just as reliable as their SOHC counterparts.|$|R
