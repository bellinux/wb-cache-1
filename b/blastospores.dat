Here we identify a Mas 5 homologue (46. 86 kDa) in Beauveria bassiana and show its indispensability for host infection and environmental adaptation of the fungal insect pathogen. The deletion of mas 5 caused severe defects in aerial conidiation, conidial germination and submerged <b>blastospore</b> production (mimic to host haemocoel). The deletion mutant lost 100 % virulence to Galleria mellonella larvae through normal cuticular penetration (topical inoculation) and 50 % through cuticle-bypassing infection (intrahaemocoel injection).
