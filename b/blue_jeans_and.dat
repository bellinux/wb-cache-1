25|$|Kelvin's clothed {{body was}} found by a {{geologist}} on 24 July 1983. Little effort was put into concealing the body; Kelvin was found wearing the same Channel 9 shirt, <b>blue</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> white sneakers which he wore {{on the day of}} his abduction, together with the dog collar fitted around his neck. The {{body was found}} placed in the fetal position, with his legs bent towards his chest and his head forwards and his arms wrapped around his legs. This made police suspect that Kelvin had been dumped by a single person, most likely after nightfall in order to avoid detection.|$|E

He did not reveal himself, but it was apparent that it was a masked Sakuraba and that he signed with K-1 and FEG. A day later, Sakuraba appeared at a FEG press conference to announce he would fight in Hero's. His defection to Hero's was a culmination of several signs that suggested he was leaving Pride. It was reported that Sakuraba left Takada Dojo (run by Pride's general manager, Nobuhiko Takada), and conspicuously was not entered into Pride's 2006 Open Weight Grand Prix Tournament.|$|E

The Midland Railroad {{was incorporated}} May 2, 1850 to build a new entrance to Boston, merging with the existing one south of Dedham. The two companies were consolidated with the Norfolk County Railroad on December 12, 1853 to form the Boston and New York Central Railroad, which had the intent of continuing southwest through Connecticut all the way to New York City. The first section of this extension was incorporated in May 1853 as the East Thompson Railroad, forming the Connecticut portion of the Southbridge and Blackstone.|$|E

500|$|The National Repertory Orchestra {{was founded}} as the Blue Jeans Symphony in 1960 by cellist and {{conductor}} Walter Charles. It was originally {{based in the}} summer resort town of Estes Park, Colorado. Charles had conceived the idea for an intensive summer training camp for aspiring orchestral musicians in the 1950s {{when he was the}} conductor of the Wichita Falls Symphony Orchestra and chose Estes Park after vacationing there with his wife. The program was launched with 55 musicians and a $2000 grant from the town's chamber of commerce. In its early days, the young musicians worked all day in jobs at the resort and rehearsed from 10p.m. to midnight. This was a requirement for all the musicians, regardless of their ability to pay for their room and board, and one which Charles described at the time as [...] "part of the philosophical training of the Blue Jeans program." [...] The orchestra performed their concerts in <b>blue</b> <b>jeans,</b> <b>and</b> Charles conducted in a denim white tie and tails especially made for him by Levi-Strauss.|$|E
500|$|... "Fantasy" [...] was {{performed}} at every show on her Daydream World Tour (1996) {{set to the}} album version. The performance was tuned similarly to Carey's recital at the American Music Awards, featuring a similar outfit, dance routines and set up. The remix version {{was performed}} on her Butterfly World Tour (1998), Rainbow World Tour (2000), [...] (2004), and The Adventures of Mimi tour (2006), and The Elusive Chanteuse Show (2014) each of which featured a varying synopsis. In 1998, it became the first time Carey performed the remix version in concert, placing a large projection screen on to the stage, and featuring snippets and cuts of O.D.B. throughout the video. Additionally, Carey was dressed in <b>blue</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> a white blouse, and danced several chair routines with several male dancers. During the Charmbracelet Tour and Rainbow Tour, the shows segment was similar to her previous tour. The song was featured on the select set-list on three of Carey's live taped shows, , The Adventures of Mimi, and Around the World. Carey also featured the song as the ninth in the setlist for her 2015 Las Vegas residency, Mariah Carey Number 1's.|$|E

They are all wearing ripped/faded <b>blue</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> leather jackets, standing upright against the brick wall of a private community garden called Albert's Garden, located in the Bowery neighborhood of New York City between Bowery Street and Second Street. The stance of the group members in the photograph would influence their future cover designs as well, {{with the majority of}} their succeeding albums using a picture of the band on the front cover. Music historian Legs McNeil states that [...] "Tommy [...] standing on his tip-toes and Joey [...] hunched over a bit." [...] The back cover art, which depicts a belt buckle with a bald eagle and the band's logo, was designed by Arturo Vega. Liner notes on the back cover fail to acknowledge backing vocalists and additional instrument players. Leigh, who performed backing vocals on several tracks, asked guitarist Johnny why he was not mentioned on the record's credits. Johnny replied: [...] "We didn't want people to get confused with who's in the band or who's not. It's our first album, you know, and we didn't want people to get confused." ...|$|E

500|$|Epstein had {{no prior}} {{experience}} of artist management, {{yet he had}} a strong influence on the band's early dress code and stage demeanor. They had previously worn <b>blue</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> leather jackets, and they would stop and start songs when they felt like it or when an audience member requested a certain song. David Pomerran Szatmary states that when Epstein first saw them at The Cavern Club, he thought, [...] "They were a scruffy crowd in leather, {{and they were not}} very tidy and not very clean. They smoked as they played and they ate and talked and pretended to hit each other." [...] Epstein encouraged them to wear suits and ties, insisted that they stop swearing, smoking, drinking, or eating on stage, and also suggested the famous synchronised bow {{at the end of their}} performances. McCartney was the first to agree with Epstein's suggestions, believing that they reflected Epstein's RADA training. Epstein explained that the process from leather jackets and jeans to suits took some time: [...] "I encouraged them, at first, to get out of the leather jackets and jeans, and I wouldn't allow them to appear in jeans after a short time, and then, after that step, I got them to wear sweaters on stage, and then, very reluctantly, eventually, suits." [...] Epstein took the group to Wirral to see his friend, master tailor Beno Dorn, who made them their first suits based on a design they had previously seen, but which Epstein approved of: [...] "I thought it was an excellent design at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 21, 1946, {{physicist}} Louis Slotin {{and seven}} other Los Alamos personnel {{were in a}} Los Alamos laboratory conducting another experiment to verify the exact point at which a subcritical mass (core) of fissile material could be made critical by the positioning of neutron reflectors. Slotin, who was leaving Los Alamos, was showing the technique to Alvin C. Graves, who would {{use it in a}} final test before the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests scheduled a month later at Bikini Atoll. It required the operator to place two half-spheres of beryllium (a neutron reflector) around the core to be tested and manually lower the top reflector over the core via a thumb hole on the top. As the reflectors were manually moved closer and farther away from each other, scintillation counters measured the relative activity from the core. Allowing them to close completely could result in the instantaneous formation of a critical mass and a lethal power excursion. Under Slotin's unapproved protocol, the only thing preventing this was the blade of a standard straight screwdriver, manipulated by the scientist's other hand. Slotin, who was given to bravado, became the local expert, performing the test on almost a dozen occasions, often in his trademark <b>blue</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> cowboy boots, in front of a roomful of observers. Enrico Fermi reportedly told Slotin and others they would be [...] "dead within a year" [...] if they continued performing it. [...] Scientists referred to this flirting with the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction as [...] "tickling the dragon's tail", based on a remark by physicist Richard Feynman, who compared the experiments to [...] "tickling the tail of a sleeping dragon".|$|E
