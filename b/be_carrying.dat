After detaching prize crews, Surcouf transferred his command, {{along with his}} remaining 22 crew members and Émilies four guns, to Cartier, which (according to Ambroise Louis Garneray) he renamed Hasard. Surcouf then sent Émilie, under Lieutenant Croizet, together with his prizes, to Isle de France.|$|E

5|$|A precise {{description}} {{and interpretation of}} the work has remained elusive since its initial discovery in the 19th century. Scholars agree on some aspects and disagree on others. British Greek art scholar Martin Robertson notes that both women can be seen wearing the tubular peplos garment common to the Classical period. According to the descriptive text found in the Atlas database of the exhibited works of art at the Louvre, the women also are wearing a kekryphalos, a hairnet in the Greco-Roman hairstyle, and appear to hold a type of flower, perhaps poppy or pomegranate. One {{of the women in}} the stele carries what resembles a bag, presumed to <b>be</b> <b>carrying</b> seeds in the interpretation.|$|E
5|$|An {{event of}} grave {{embarrassment to the}} Soviet Union came in October 1981 when one of its {{submarines}} ran aground near the Swedish naval base at Karlskrona. As this was a militarily sensitive location, Sweden took an aggressive stance on the incident, detaining the Whiskey-class sub for two weeks as they awaited an official explanation from Moscow. Eventually it was released, but Stockholm refused to accept Soviet claims that this was merely an accident, especially since numerous unidentified submarines had been spotted near the Swedish coast. Sweden also announced that radiation had been detected emanating from the submarine and they believed it to <b>be</b> <b>carrying</b> nuclear missiles. Moscow would neither confirm nor deny this and instead merely accused the Swedes of espionage.|$|E
5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{involves the}} manipulation of company earnings towards a pre-determined target. This target can be motivated by a preference for more stable earnings, in which case management is said to <b>be</b> <b>carrying</b> out income smoothing. Opportunistic income smoothing can in turn signal lower risk and increase a firm's market value. Other possible motivations for earnings management include {{the need to maintain}} the levels of certain accounting ratios due to debt covenants, and the pressure to maintain increasing earnings and to beat analyst targets.|$|E

5|$|Halkett was {{an amateur}} inventor, and during {{his spare time}} whilst serving in the navy he worked on solving {{the problem of how}} to design a boat that would be small and light enough to {{transport}} easily on foot through wilderness, but robust enough to carry people in safety across wide bodies of water. His solution was to design a boat in which all components would double as items of clothing, or accessories that Halkett assumed the user would <b>be</b> <b>carrying</b> in any event.|$|E
5|$|In Iran, some golden jackals carry {{intestinal}} worms (helminths) and Echinococcus granulosus. In Israel, some jackals carry intestinal helminths and Leishmania tropica infection. In Romania, a jackal {{was found}} to <b>be</b> <b>carrying</b> Trichinella britovi. In northeastern Italy, the jackal is a carrier of the tick species Ixodes ricinus and Dermacentor reticulatus, and the smallest human fluke Metagonimus yokogawai that can be caught from ingesting infected raw fish, {{which can lead to}} metagonimiasis. In Hungary, some jackals carry dog heartworm Dirofilaria immitis, and some have provided the first record in Hungary of Trichinella spiralis and the first record in Europe of Echinococcus multilocularis. The jackal is dispersing across Europe through rivers and valleys, bringing parasites into regions where these did not previously exist.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of dams on the Missouri, pallid sturgeon migrated hundreds of miles upstream to spawn, and sought out rocky or hard surfaces to deposit hundreds of thousands of eggs. One female pallid sturgeon caught in the upper Missouri River was estimated to <b>be</b> <b>carrying</b> 170,000 eggs, representing over 11 percent of its total body weight. After fertilization, pallid sturgeon eggs hatch in 5 to 8 days, after which the larvae drift back downstream for several weeks. As the larvae develop tails, they seek out slower-moving waterways and slowly mature over a period of a dozen years. The rate of survival to maturity for pallid sturgeon larvae is extremely low, and of {{the hundreds of thousands of}} eggs spawned, only a few live to adulthood.|$|E

With the exception of certain types of RNA, most other biological molecules are relatively inert elements upon which proteins act.

The set of proteins expressed in a particular cell or cell type is known as its proteome.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, the Regia Marina {{had decided}} {{to dispose of the}} {{obsolescent}} cruiser. Rumors that year of a potential sale to the Ecuadorian Navy prompted Peru to buy the old French cruiser , though Ecuador did not end up purchasing Umbria. Instead, in December 1910, the Regia Marina sold Umbria to the Haitian Navy, but she did not arrive in Port-de-Paix, Haiti, until 13 June 1911. After the sale, the ship was renamed Consul Gostrück. The ship was rumored to <b>be</b> <b>carrying</b> Cipriano Castro, the deposed president of Venezuela, though they later proved to be false. A German captain, Willy Meyer, was hired to take command of the ship upon its arrival in Haiti, but due to the lengthy delays, he quit. The cruiser sank shortly after entering service because her crew was not experienced in handling the ship. Umbria was eventually raised and towed to Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for disposal in 1913.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, Asashōryū {{posted a}} 14–1 record, his fourth {{straight}} championship since returning from injury, {{and became the}} fifth man to win twenty career championships. In March, he dropped his first two bouts but then won thirteen in a row for a 13–2 score. However, this {{was not enough to}} win the title—he lost a playoff {{for the first time in}} his career, to fellow Mongolian Hakuhō. In May he turned in a below par 10–5 record, losing to all four ōzeki and maegashira Aminishiki (although he appeared to <b>be</b> <b>carrying</b> an injury). Hakuhō won this tournament as well and was promoted to yokozuna immediately afterwards. Asashōryū had been the sole yokozuna for a total of 21 tournaments since the retirement of Musashimaru in November 2003 – the longest period of time in sumo history. In July he lost to Aminishiki once again on the opening day but rallied to win the next fourteen bouts, taking his 21st title with a 14–1 record. He was suspended by the Sumo Association from the next two tournaments (see below).|$|E
