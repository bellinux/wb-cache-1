40|$|In-line <b>bit</b> <b>interleaving</b> {{has over}} the last decade been used in a number of papers, and has proven to be very effective. Although it has several {{advantages}} over conventional <b>bit</b> <b>interleaving,</b> the use of conventional <b>bit</b> <b>interleaving</b> is still far more common. One {{reason for this is that}} the advantages of in-line <b>bit</b> <b>interleaving</b> are not widely recognized yet. Another reason is that the most commonly used code design principles cannot be used with in-line <b>bit</b> <b>interleaving.</b> Hence, in this thesis we will propose new code design principles that can be used for systems with in-line <b>bit</b> <b>interleaving.</b> Design rules will be proposed for both the inner and the outer code of a serially concatenated system. The system considered throughout this thesis is serially concatenated trellis coded modulation (SCTCM) with throughput 2 bits/symbol and 8 PSK signaling over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Several of the new ideas are, however, applicable to any bit interleaved system that use iterative decoding. The new design rules for the inner code are based upon the characteristics of bit interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID). BICM-ID can be seen as an SCTCM system with a one-state inner code. We use this fact and extend the design principles of BICM-ID to be valid for inner codes with more than one state. Furthermore, we will analyze the in-line bit interleaver and explain its advantages. In the analysis, the mutual information (MI) constellation is proposed. The MI constellation becomes a very useful tool in the design of the the outer code. We propose new design rules for the outer code that explains how to design the outer code in respect to the MI constellation...|$|E
40|$|A {{communication}} system using in-line bit interleaved serially concatenated trellis coded modulation (SCTCM) over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is investigated. In-line <b>bit</b> <b>interleaving</b> {{refers to an}} interleaving method for which the random bit interleaver is divided into several independent constituent bit interleavers. Normally, an in-line bit interleaved serially concatenated code consists of a rate r_o=k_o/n_o outer code, followed by n_o separate bit interleavers whose outputs are fed to a rate r_i=k_i/n_i inner code, where n_o=k_i. Unlike conventional random <b>bit</b> <b>interleaving,</b> the input and output sequences of an in-line bit interleaver are not entirely decoupled. Hence, previously known code design principles for serially concatenated codes cannot be directly applied to this code structure. Some code design methods, such as curve matching by using extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) analysis, completely rely on properties that require conventional random <b>bit</b> <b>interleaving.</b> The objective of this thesis is therefore {{to develop a new}} code design methodology for in-line bit interleaved serially concatenated codes and design new in-line bit interleaved SCTCM systems. Design guidelines are introduced for both the inner and outer codes. As inner code we investigate both recursive and non-recursive convolutional codes. It is shown - perhaps somewhat surprisingly - that non-recursive inner codes sometimes may be preferable over recursive inner codes. The simulated bit error rate (BER) performance indicates that SCTCM systems using in-line <b>bit</b> <b>interleaving</b> outperforms SCTCM systems with conventional <b>bit</b> <b>interleaving.</b> Simulation results are obtained for various throughputs and signal constellations.

The dominant effects, {{responsible for the}} degradation of an OFDM system performance, if phase noise is present, are identified.

Consideration of the system capacity {{in the presence of}} phase noise, motivates the idea, that <b>bit</b> <b>interleaving</b> can significantly improve the system performance. For systems where interleaving delay is a critical issue, we propose, as a second approach, an iterative phase noise suppression algorithm.

40|$|Abstract—We examine bit- and symbol-interleaving {{strategies}} for linear nonbinary block codes (under bounded-distance decoding) {{over the family}} of binary additive noise finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) models with memory. We derive a simple analytical sufficient condition under which perfect (i. e., with infinite interleaving depth) symbol interleaving outperforms perfect <b>bit</b> <b>interleaving</b> {{in terms of the}} probability of codeword error (PCE). It is shown that the well-known Gilbert–Elliott channel (GEC) with positive noise-correlation coefficient and the recently introduced Markovian queue-based channel (QBC) of memory M satisfy this condition. This result has widely been illustrated numerically (without proof) in the literature, particularly for the GEC. We also provide examples of binary FSMC models for which the reverse result holds, i. e., perfect <b>bit</b> <b>interleaving</b> outperforming perfect symbol interleaving. Finally, a numerical PCE study of imperfect symbol-interleaved nonbinary codes over the QBC indicates that there is a linear relationship between the optimal interleaving depth and a function of a single parameter of the QBC.

40|$|The {{codeword}} {{error rate}} (WER) performance of noncoherent FSK with soft decision decoding of block codes using Chase's second algorithm is investigated in a Rayleigh fading channel. The received signal envelope is sampled {{and used as}} channel measurement information. The theoretical {{upper and lower bounds}} of the WER are derived, assuming independent Rayleigh envelope samples in a received block. When the Golay (23, 12, 7) code is used, soft decision decoding with 6 -bit error correction capability (3 -bit error and 3 -bit erasure) requires an average signal-to-noise power ratio about 5 dB lower than that for minimum distance decoding with 3 -bit error correction to obtain a WER= 10 ^. The effects of <b>bit</b> <b>interleaving</b> on the WER performance when fading envelope variations is slow compared to the bit rate are investigated through computer simulations.

In particular, we examine two interleaving strategies encountered when dealing with non-binary codes over a binary channel; namely, symbol interleaving and <b>bit</b> <b>interleaving.</b> An analytical proof is given demonstrating that perfect (i. e., with infinite interleaving depth) symbol interleaving results in a better performance compared to perfect <b>bit</b> <b>interleaving</b> for any non-binary block code over either the QBC or the GEC with positive noise correlation coefficient. Next, the effect of imperfect interleaving on the code performance is examined.

40|$|This thesis report {{describes}} {{new designs}} for transmitters and receivers of <b>bit</b> <b>interleaved</b> coded modulations over multiple antenna channels. The {{objective is to}} achieve near Shannon capacity performance over ergodic channels and near outage probability performance over block fading channels. Iterative joint detection and decoding are applied in the aim of achieving near maximum likelihood performance. Design criteria are derived for each block optimization from the error performance expressions under the ideal interleaving assumption. First, we describe the binary mapping optimization for ergodic channels by introducing the new concept of multidimensional mapping that provides large amount of coding gain. We achieve near capacity performance either with turbo-codes or with multi-dimensional mappings associated with a simple code. Then, we present the <b>bit</b> <b>interleaved</b> coded modulation with linear precoding as a Space-Time code for multiple antenna block fading channels. We show that the channel interleaver is the fundamental part of the <b>bit</b> <b>interleaved</b> coded modulation calling the shots about the achieved diversity.

The minimal linear precoder size providing full diversity is deduced from a modified singleton bound applied to the global Euclidean code. We show that full diversity and quasi-optimal coding gains are observed for a given error correcting code. Finally, we achieve near outage capacity performance thanks to turbo-codes. Next, iterative joint detection and decoding techniques are considered, we describe a near optimum soft-input soft-output list sphere decoder which allows the computation of a posteriori probabilities for very high spectral efficiency transmitter schemes with reduced complexity...|$|R
