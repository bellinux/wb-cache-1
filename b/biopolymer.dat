5|$|The biopolymers that {{comprise}} DNA, RNA and (poly)peptides are linear polymers (i.e.: each monomer {{is connected to}} at most two other monomers). The sequence of their monomers effectively encodes information. The transfers of information described by the central dogma ideally are faithful, deterministic transfers, wherein one biopolymer's sequence {{is used as a}} template for the construction of another <b>biopolymer</b> with a sequence that is entirely dependent on the original biopolymer's sequence.|$|E
5|$|Heritable {{traits are}} passed from one {{generation}} to the next via DNA, a molecule that encodes genetic information. DNA is a long <b>biopolymer</b> composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism. However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by quantitative trait loci (multiple interacting genes).|$|E

50|$|<b>Biopolymers</b> are {{synthesized}} as {{a result}} of biological processes, and are often less harmful to the landscape and its biota because of their natural origins. Of the three types of <b>biopolymers,</b> polysaccharidess have proven more useful as soil binders than polynucleotides or polypeptides. <b>Biopolymers</b> that have been tested for use in soil stabilization include cellulose, starch, chitosan, xanthan, curdlan, and beta-glucan. Some <b>biopolymers</b> are sensitive to water, and wetter soils exhibit weaker biopolymer-clay cohesion. Because of this, when wetted, gel-type <b>biopolymers</b> form hydrogels which have decreased tensile strength but significantly higher compressive strength compared to the original soil. Protein-based <b>biopolymers,</b> though less common, have been used as an alternative to polysaccharides for projects requiring greater water resistance.|$|R

The outer pollen wall, which prevents the pollen grain from shrinking and crushing the genetic material during desiccation, is composed of two layers. These two layers are the tectum and the foot layer, which is just above the intine. The tectum and foot layer are separated by a region called the columella, which is composed of strengthening rods.

25|$|Biomolecular {{chemistry}} {{is a major}} category within organic chemistry which is frequently studied by biochemists. Many complex multi-functional group molecules are important in living organisms. Some are long-chain biopolymers, and these include peptides, DNA, RNA and the polysaccharides such as starches in animals and celluloses in plants. The other main classes are amino acids (monomer building blocks of peptides and proteins), carbohydrates (which includes the polysaccharides), the nucleic acids (which include DNA and RNA as polymers), and the lipids. In addition, animal biochemistry contains many small molecule intermediates which assist in energy production through the Krebs cycle, and produces isoprene, the most common hydrocarbon in animals. Isoprenes in animals form the important steroid structural (cholesterol) and steroid hormone compounds; and in plants form terpenes, terpenoids, some alkaloids, and a class of hydrocarbons called <b>biopolymer</b> polyisoprenoids present in the latex of various species of plants, which {{is the basis for}} making rubber.|$|E
25|$|Deoxyribonucleic acid is a {{molecule}} that carries {{most of the}} genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins and complex carbohydrates, {{they are one of}} the three major types of macromolecule that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two <b>biopolymer</b> strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. The two DNA strands are known as polynucleotides since they are composed of simpler units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of a nitrogen-containing nucleobase—either cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A), or thymine (T)—as well as a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. According to base pairing rules (A with T, and C with G), hydrogen bonds bind the nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037, and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 TtC (trillion tons of carbon).|$|E

2500|$|The rough secondary-structure {{content of}} a <b>biopolymer</b> (e.g., [...] "this protein is 40% α-helix and 20% β-sheet.") can be {{estimated}} spectroscopically. For proteins, a common method is far-ultraviolet (far-UV, 170–250nm) circular dichroism. A pronounced double minimum at 208 and 222nm indicate α-helical structure, whereas a single minimum at 204nm or 217nm reflects random-coil or β-sheet structure, respectively. A less common method is infrared spectroscopy, which detects differences in the bond oscillations of amide groups due to hydrogen-bonding. Finally, secondary-structure contents may be estimated accurately using the chemical shifts of an initially unassigned NMR spectrum.|$|E

2500|$|An old {{standing}} dynamic {{problem is}} how DNA [...] "self-replication" [...] {{takes place in}} living cells that should involve transient uncoiling of supercoiled DNA fibers. Although DNA consists of relatively rigid, very large elongated <b>biopolymer</b> molecules called fibers or chains (that are made of repeating nucleotide units of four basic types, attached to deoxyribose and phosphate groups), its molecular structure in vivo undergoes dynamic configuration changes that involve dynamically attached water molecules and ions.

[...] The microbial cellulose topical applications are effective due to the cellulose's water holding ability and water vapor permeability. [...] The high water holding ability provides a moist atmosphere at the injury site, which is critical in healing, while the wicking ability allows seepage from the wound {{to be removed from}} the site. [...] Also, the microbial cellulose molds very well {{to the surface of the}} skin, providing a conformal covering even in usually difficult places to dress wounds, such as areas on the face.
