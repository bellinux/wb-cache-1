40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{designate}} those characteristics of a <b>brokerage</b> <b>contract</b> that distinguish it from other types of contracts. The author begins by analysing the notion of insurance mediation {{on the basis of}} its legal definition as well as the practice o f the market. In consequence, he uses the notion in its strict sense, i. e. in reference to concluding transactions, and not denoting any form of consulting, especially risk management. Since the main area of insurance broker’s activity consists in rendering services of insurance mediation, the author proposes to define <b>brokerage</b> <b>contract</b> as contract for these services. However, if an insurance broker renders any additional services, in particular in the area of risk management, then two separate and different legal relations occur. Furthermore, a <b>brokerage</b> <b>contract</b> is characteristic on the one hand for its parties, as the broker is always a party to the contract, and on the other for the fact that the broker is remunerated by the insurer rather than the client himself, although it is the client that orders the services (the contract is thus considered gratuitous). The remuneration, called brokerage fee, is paid for the service of insurance mediation, which aims at facilitating the conclusion of an insurance contract. This leads to the conclusion that two types of services rendered by the broker should be distinguished: consultation (not remunerated by the insurer) and mediation services, which make the broker’s remuneration model so distinctive...|$|E
40|$|Terms such as {{commission}} and brokerage are similar {{in the concept of}} agency and in some cases they are different. In the legal system of Iran, commission section is derived from French law and it drives out the commission from the realm of agency and justifies it as an entity equal to the contract of the mandate. On the other hand, the brokerage has not been discussed in Iran’s jurisprudential sources and civil law as a legal body establishment; therefore, we can take it as new found phenomena that came to our legal system simultaneous with the commercial law concepts.   Such differences between commission agent with broker can be stated like this: the commission agent is only obliged to announce the actions and especially do his missions to the commander, in fact the commission agent has the right of disclosure before his commander, but according to the article 337 of the written law, the broker also has the right of disclosure of the details of transaction toward the party with whom the <b>brokerage</b> <b>contract</b> has not been signed. The broker is usually the middleman of the transmission in consideration of receiving a specific amount of money or he can find a party for a person who wants to conduct a transaction and he himself doesn’t get involved in the transaction and is not engaged, whereas the commission agent is directly a contracting party and the true beneficiary (commander) which the transaction is done in his account has no contact with the main buyer. This survey is done by the analytical-descriptive method for comparing the brokerage and commission in the commercial law of Iran...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of Supreme {{administrative}} court decision making concerning value added tax Resumé: Aim of this graduation thesis is {{to analyze the}} verdict of the Supreme {{administrative court}} concerning value added tax with focus on deduction of tax from <b>brokerage</b> <b>contracts.</b> <b>Brokerage</b> <b>contracts</b> {{can be used as}} fictive claims for tax deduction. Therefore these contracts undergo a close examination by tax administrators. It is than upon the tax subject to prove whether these contracts were fulfilled. Proving this is however not easy, because these contracts unlike others don't have any tangible outputs. Graduation thesis is separated into 3 sections. First section is a breakdown of legal regulations concerning this theme. First sub-section consists of deeper look at value added tax, second sub-section talks about <b>brokerage</b> <b>contracts</b> and third about administrative justice and the status of Supreme administrative court. Last sub-section informs about proofs in tax procedure. Second section analysis different verdicts of the Supreme administrative court. Seven most important verdicts are analyzed in big detail, the other ten verdicts in less detail. By each verdict there is a description of facts, used evidence, objections and reasoned decision. Third section analysis different problems, that occurred in verdicts. Such [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|Justice Sandra Day O'Connor {{wrote for}} a 5–4 {{majority}} that Wilko did not cover claims under the 1934 Act, since that Court had expressed {{doubts about the}} ability of arbitration to protect a claimants' rights under the 1933 Act that the present court had recently indicated it no longer shared. The nonwaiver provision of the 1934 Act applied only to its substantive provisions. She was unpersuaded that the adhesive nature of most <b>brokerage</b> <b>contracts</b> required greater protection for investors, and noted that most of the reservations the Wilko Court expressed had been rejected by later holdings on arbitration. The later amendments, she wrote, had not addressed the issue and been meant to enhance the self-regulatory powers of the stock exchanges and organizations like the National Association of Securities Dealers.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an architecture designed for serious simulation games to automatically generate game scenarios adapted to player's level and knowledge. We detail two central modules of the architecture: (1) the player model and (2) the adaptation module. The player model estimates the current {{knowledge of the}} player using a Bayesian Network (BN). The evidence variables in the BN are assigned through the observation of player's actions and {{the current state of}} the simulation. Considering the estimated player's knowledge and skills, the adaptation module uses automated planning algorithms to dynamically adjust the parameters of the simulation, in order to generate scenarios that will be well suited to improve player's knowledge and skills. We implemented our proposed game architecture in a simulation serious game named Game of Homes. The purpose of this game is to teach the basis of real estate. The player is a virtual real estate broker in a city who has to seek for <b>brokerage</b> <b>contracts,</b> estimate the value of houses, fix asked prices, perform visits, and close the deals. The player competes with other brokers driven by artificial intelligence (AI). We conducted a pilot experiment with human participants (N= 10) to validate our architecture in Game of Homes. On day 1, participants were asked to take a pre-test about real estate skills taught in our game. On day 2, participants played Game of Homes for approximately 90 minutes and then filled up a motivation questionnaire. On day 3, participants took a post-test. Preliminary results show that in addition to induce strong motivation among the players, Game of Homes significantly improved real estate skills between pre-tests and post-tests. Results suggest that our serious game architecture allows (a) to induce learning process by providing content adapted to the player progression and (b) to keep the player motivated and interested during the game by adapting the challenge and providing new content...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} collects {{research on}} real estate <b>brokerage</b> and <b>contract</b> theory that was completed while the author {{was a student at}} the University of California, San Diego. Chapter 1 presents an empirical analysis of the role of social networks in economic decision-making. Specifically, it is demonstrated that individuals are likely to choose the same real estate agent as a peer who is in the same social network. Evidence is presented that the social influence comes through peer-to-peer communication. Chapter 2 offers a simple model of hold-up in a contracting environment where the contracted trade retains its value indefinitely. A simple option contract has both an efficient and an inefficient hold-up equilibrium. More complicated contracts can uniquely implement any efficient outcome. Chapter 3 investigates whether entry into the real estate brokerage industry is inefficiently high. Previous research on this topic suffers from restrictive data. Use of data from a multiple listing service allows for heterogeneity between agents and addresses the omitted variable problem...|$|R
40|$|How do markets {{spread risk}} when events are unknown or unknowable and where not {{anticipated}} in an insurance contract? While the policyholder can "hold up" the insurer for extra contractual payments, the continuing gains from trade {{on a single}} contract are often too small to yield useful coverage. By acting as a repository of the reputations of the parties, we show the brokers provide a coordinating mechanism to leverage the collective hold up power of policyholders. This extends both the degree of implicit and explicit coverage. The role {{is reflected in the}} terms of broker engagement, specifically in the ownership by the broker of the renewal rights. Finally, we argue that brokers can be motivated to play this role when they receive commissions that are contingent on insurer profits. This last feature questions a recent, well publicized, attack on broker compensation by New York attorney general, Elliot Spitzer.

30|$|Figure  1 in Appendix {{presents}} the conceptual mapping of shared value creation for the PCBs in Bangladesh {{in line with}} Porter and Kramer’s shared value model. The figure reveals that PCBs are creating shared value (long term business value and social & environmental value simultaneously) through their core banking operations (innovative products and services) that are meeting the banking needs of {{the bottom of the}} pyramid. The selected PCBs are to some extent focusing on the following innovative products to meet the banking needs of the bottom of the pyramid are categorized as SME (including firms of women entrepreneurs), agriculture (including rural micro credit), mobile financial services, environment friendly banking, and school banking. The PCBs are also focusing on time, cost, convenience and easiness of customers for those innovative products (Islam and Hossain, 2018 b). To do so, banks have also been broadly innovating their services such as ATMs, Cash Deposit Machines (CDMs), fast track, agent banking, online banking, SMS, call centers, corporate cash management, locker, remittance, advisory, <b>brokerage,</b> E-Commerce, <b>contract</b> farming, cluster based financing etc. The core banking operations of PCBs are creating concurrent value for both the business and society. The core banking operations are creating business value of PCBs in terms of improved profitability, productivity, market share and corporate reputation. Simultaneously, the core banking operations are also creating social value in terms of (i) enhanced job creation in the banks and self employment opportunities in rural areas, (Bendell, 2004) access to banking for the unbanked, (Bissoon, 2018) service and comfort for customers, (Bowen, 1953) regional development, (Broomhill, 2007) regulatory compliance, (Burke & Logsdon, 1996) government income, (Campbell, 2007) employee and customer learning, and (Carroll, 1979) reduced environment footprint among other.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1895 and 1930, Sino-Burmese {{businesses}} were initially concentrated within three sectors: <b>Brokerage,</b> manufacturing, and <b>contracting.</b> Under British rule, Chinese {{share of the}} businesses was reduced significantly from 28.5 to 10 percent in manufacturing, 26.6 to 1.8 percent in brokerage and 31 to 4.3 percent in contracting while Burmese Indians improved their economic positions significantly and controlled {{a larger proportion of}} the businesses within the three sectors. Other major sectors between 1895 and 1930 that declined included banking and money-lending, dropping from 33.3 percent to zero. Trading changed from 13.3 to 12.6 percent. Similar drops in market share occurred in the import-export trade, extraction, distribution-supply, and business partnerships. However, Chinese share in milling increased from 0 to 4.5 percent, agents from 13.3 to 15.6 percent, shopkeeping from 6.7 to 18.3 percent, and merchanting from 12.3 to 13.1 percent. [...] Of the 47 rice mills in Burma, 13 percent was controlled by ethnic Chinese and was utilized for rice exportation and processing. During the last few decades of the 19th century, Chinese turned to rural money-lending. Sino-Burmese businessmen also ran illicit opium and gambling dens, tea shops, liquor stores and also acted as agents for the sale of petroleum products.|$|R
40|$|Employment, <b>brokerage,</b> {{and other}} <b>contracts</b> {{routinely}} include 2 ̆ 2 predispute 2 ̆ 2 arbitration clauses-provisions requiring {{the parties to}} submit any and all future disputes to arbitrators rather than courts. In recent years, courts have come to enforce these clauses in the vast run of cases, requiring parties to arbitrate even when the underlying dispute implicates employment discrimination, antitrust, or other 2 ̆ 2 public law 2 ̆ 2 rights. In response to this trend, interest has grown in the extent of courts 2 ̆ 7 authority to overturn arbitral awards that do not give effect to such rights. At first blush, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) {{does not appear to}} authorize any such review, but federal and many state courts have come to recognize an additional, judge-made ground for overturning awards in cases in which arbitrators have 2 ̆ 2 manifestly disregarded 2 ̆ 2 governing law. This Article concludes that the 2 ̆ 2 manifest disregard 2 ̆ 2 doctrine as it stands is legally baseless and should be abandoned. In its place, the Article urges courts to recognize a distinct but related ground for overturning arbitral awards-a ground rooted in the arbitration contract itself. Traditional contract law doctrines encourage courts to choose contract readings or imply contract terms needed to make an agreement valid and enforceable. The Article contends that in many cases predispute arbitration clauses would be invalid absent an arbitral duty to apply the law in good faith because, without this duty, such clauses would interfere with the law 2 ̆ 7 s deterrent function. Society has a powerful interest in the role many legal rights play in deterring misconduct, and studies show that deterrence depends critically on a legal regime 2 ̆ 7 s accuracy. A duty to take the law seriously and make good faith efforts to apply it correctly should be a bare minimum required for effective deterrence within any system of adjudication, and it is this duty that courts therefore must find in agreements to arbitrate future disputes. Having recognized this duty, the Article concludes that the FAA itself gives courts the power to review awards to ensure that arbitrators are living up to it in rendering awards...|$|R
