40|$|ABSTRACT Background: <b>Bedsores</b> are {{injuries}} to skin and underlying tissues caused by prolonged pressure. Although, some methods like frequently changing position and using particular tools {{are used for}} preventing and caring of pressure ulcers, their prevention would still be as a vital urgency. Olive oil is an herbal product with potential preventive effects to prevent <b>bedsores</b> because of its numerous medical properties. The major {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether topical olive oil can prevent the risk of developing <b>bedsores</b> in I. C. U. patients. Methods: This clinical trial was accomplished in 2014 with 60 patients who were selected by simple random sampling method into intervention and control groups. During three weeks, the control group had received routine skin care, while the intervention group had received topical Olive oil in addition to the routine care. Statistical analysis, including Chi-square, T-test and Fisher’s tests, were performed with SPSS version 20 software. Results: The intervention group had contained 19 male and 11 female, with an average age of 60. 46 ± 18. 06 and the control group had contained 20 male, 10 female, with an average age of 50. 96 ± 21. 38.

40|$|<b>Bedsore</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} problems in hospitals especially ICU ward; which results in death and incapability, life quality degradation and increase of hospital costs. Pressure ulcer or <b>bedsore</b> is a lesion involves the skin or subcutaneous layers and generally comes after an undergoing constant pressure by tissues. The aim of this study is to investigate the fre-quency of <b>bedsore</b> in trauma patients. This cross-sectional study, performed on 248 trauma patients admitted in ICU of Ha-medan Be’ssat hospital and filling the inquiries was based on variables.

40|$|Background: <b>Bedsore</b> {{is common}} scene {{to those who}} take care of {{bedridden}} patients. <b>Bedsore</b> {{is the cause of}} morbidity, mortality, heavy expenses, and decrease of life quality to the patients. Using some indicators to predict <b>bedsore</b> would be helpful in recognizing this phenomenon to prevent its development. Therefore, the current study is an assessment of <b>bedsore</b> by using Braden index. It is anticipated that this study could be applicable in prevention of bedsores in bedridden patients. Materials and Methods: This descriptive-analytic study was done to determine the value of Braden scale in assessment of <b>bedsore</b> factors in 222 patients admitted to the ICU, and surgical wards in Fatemeh Zahra and Salman Farsi hospitals in Bushehr-Iran. Data collection tools included demographic questionnaire and Braden scale. Demographic questionnaire and Braden scale were completed for all the research units. Patients were examined for bedsores at regular intervals until discharge from hospital. Presence of bedsores and the time of <b>bedsore</b> development were registered. Data was analyzed by STATA and SPSS ver. 13 softwares, ROC CURP, T test and X 2. Results: Out of 222 subjects 14 % (31 patients) suffered from bedsores 18 male (12. 7 %) and 13 female (16. 3 %). The most prevalent sites for bedsor were heel and sacrom (30 %). The effect of weight, age and sex was insignificant among the patients with bedsores compared to the patients without bedsores (p= 0. 293, p= 0. 576, p= 0. 867). The effect of bed on <b>bedsore</b> was insignificant (p= 0. 739). The effect of smoking on <b>bedsore</b> was insignificant (p= 0. 738). Walking (p= 0. 03), and movement of limbs (p= 0. 001) were two braden indices which showed significant relationship with <b>bedsore</b> development. By using STATA, score 14 of Braden scale was recognized as best point for <b>bedsore</b> prediction (sensitivity 52 %, and specifity 61 %).

40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} {{efficacy and}} safety of ampucare, a polyherbal product, in patients with <b>bedsore.</b> Methods: One hundred patients, either sex, more than 18 years of age, with <b>bedsore</b> were divided in to two groups of 50 each. Group-I- Served as control- povidone iodine solution was applied locally on the <b>bedsore,</b> once daily. Group- II- Treatment group- ampucare lotion was applied locally, once daily. Primary end point was time to wound healing and secondary end point included reduction in wound surface area at day- 7 and at treatment completion. Percent patients cured, improved, or treatment failure were noted. Depth of wound, % healing and adverse effects were recorded. Results: Application of ampucare in patients with <b>bedsore</b> resulted in rapid healing as compared to control group. Reduction in wound surface area was significant (p< 0. 01) in group-II. Maximum gain in thickness of granular tissue was observed in this group. In treatment group 68 % patients showed excellent response as compared to 60 % in control group. Ampucare was well tolerated.
