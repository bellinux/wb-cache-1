5|$|Axis forces {{employed}} <b>biological</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons. The Imperial Japanese Army used {{a variety}} of such weapons during its invasion and occupation of China (see Unit 731) and in early conflicts against the Soviets. Both the Germans and Japanese tested such weapons against civilians and, sometimes on prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|After about 10 days (1–3 weeks {{depending}} on temperatures), larvae hatch and bore directly throughout the pod walls and develop within the seed. Larvae are thus protected from <b>biological</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> control. Larval development lasts {{two to three}} months. Before entering its pupal stage, the larva cuts a circular cap. After around ten days of pupal stage, the adult emerges from the seeds. Because mating and oviposition are spread over a few weeks, adults can emerge before or after harvest.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of 2002, CIA reports {{contained}} assertions of Saddam Hussein's intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs, not properly accounting for Iraqi <b>biological</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons, and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions. Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.|$|E

It also includes networks such as the Total Atmospheric Control System (TACS), Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS), Integrated Bridge System (IBS), Battle Damage Control System (BDCS) and Personnel Locator System (PLS). The ships also include technology that enables them to fight in Nuclear, <b>Biological</b> <b>and</b> <b>Chemical</b> (NBC) warfare scenarios. The Indian Navy claims that the indigenization achieved in these ships is about 90%.|$|E

25|$|Based on {{established}} <b>biological</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> standards, every {{water body}} in Guatemala {{is considered to}} be moderately if not critically contaminated. Upper aquifers in major urban areas are contaminated from a variety of sources. In Guatemala City, untreated storm water is injected into the upper aquifer in an attempt to recharge the water supply of the city. Leaching from the landfill in Guatemala City has also severely contaminated the local aquifers and generally, only deep confined aquifers should be considered safe from <b>biological</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> contamination.|$|E
