5|$|Later, again under {{pressure}} from the plebs, a political compromise was reached in which the consuls and tribunes would give place to a commission of ten men, the decemviri, who would <b>be</b> <b>empowered</b> to publish a code of laws for all Rome. According to Livy, it codified all public and private law, but however, its promulgation did not grant further political rights to the plebs, as it enshired into the tables a law banning intermarriage between plebeians and patricians. With a short attempt to establish a tyranny by the decemviri, they were overthrown by the second secession of the army, restoring the old republic and preventing {{the creation of a new}} constitution based on the ten-man commission.|$|E
5|$|To {{cope with}} the ongoing war situation, Charles had {{introduced}} martial law to large swathes of the country; he extended this during 1626 and 1627, as the financial constraints imposed by Parliament began to cut into pay, leading to soldiers rioting. Under {{the law of the}} time, martial law was declared by the local military commander, at which point a group of Commissioners would <b>be</b> <b>empowered</b> to decide on the facts of offences, before passing the case to the commander, who would pass judgment. In practice, things worked completely differently. In Dover, the forces were commanded by Lord Conway, who declared martial law. Not only were commissioners authorised to decide on the facts, they were also permitted to authorise summary judgments, including the execution of people they deemed to be guilty. In addition, the commissioners were given the power not only to resolve billeting disputes between soldiers and civilians, but to order civilians to provide quarters for the troops. A later declaration of martial law in Portsmouth extended the commission's remit yet again, allowing for civilians to be tried under martial law and, if necessary, sentenced to death. Even this did not solve the problems, as soldiers would often wander outside the jurisdiction of the commissioners; to deal with this, February 1627 saw a Provost Marshal introduced to each county, bringing the entire nation under martial law.|$|E

25|$|Burke was {{a leading}} sceptic with respect to democracy. While admitting that theoretically, {{in some cases it}} might be desirable, he insisted a {{democratic}} government in Britain in his day would not only be inept, but also oppressive. He opposed democracy for three basic reasons. First, government required a degree of intelligence and breadth of knowledge of the sort that occurred rarely among the common people. Second, he thought that if they had the vote, common people had dangerous and angry passions that could be aroused easily by demagogues; he feared that the authoritarian impulses that could <b>be</b> <b>empowered</b> by these passions would undermine cherished traditions and established religion, leading to violence and confiscation of property. Third, Burke warned that democracy would create a tyranny over unpopular minorities, who needed the protection of the upper classes.|$|E
25|$|Despite obstacles, {{efforts are}} under way by various {{analytical}} groups to articulate the benefits to local and regional constituents and participants to encourage developments that would progressively align in support. It is known from the Talmud that {{in the time of}} King Agrippa, Jerusalem was filled with millions of visitors and pilgrims from the entire region. Today the potential of spiritual tourism would support the growth goals of the Mayor of Jerusalem for 10 million tourists annually. This would provide a significant boost to the economy and would benefit people locally and regionally, many of whom live in poverty. Since the rebuilding of the Temple can come only through a process of peace, it must be preceded by numerous efforts, including the financial and project infrastructures to support such a large increase in tourism, local and regional co-operation agreements to enable its construction and the success of modern attempts to revive the Sanhedrin, the authority which must <b>be</b> <b>empowered</b> for such an event to occur.|$|E

25|$|On 8 July 2004 the Legislative Council {{passed the}} Education (Amendment) Bill.

It was the concern of the Church that, as a sponsoring body, she would no longer <b>be</b> <b>empowered</b> in the future to supervise the schools under her sponsorship, nor be able to achieve her goals and objectives in Catholic education. On 5 June 2005, Bishop Zen announced that, if the Legislative Council pass the donation to support schools to create incorporated management committees on 8 July 2005, he would appeal against the decision to the court. After the Government decided to give up some main argued points, the Diocese decided to support the motion.|$|E
25|$|Other changes {{which were}} {{announced}} include {{the formation of}} a Talent Development Center of Excellence, the enhancement and expansion of the CIA University and the creation of the office of the Chancellor to head the CIA University in order to consolidate and unify recruitment and training efforts.

The restructuring of the entire Agency is to be revamped according to a new model whereby governance is modelled after the structure and hierarchy of corporations, said to increase the efficiency of workflow and to greatly enable the Executive Director to manage day-to-day activity. As well, another stated intention was to establish 'Mission Centers', each one to deal with a specific geographic region of the world, which will bring the full collaboration and joint efforts of the five Directorates together under one roof. While the Directorate heads will still retain ultimate authority over their respective Directorate, the Mission Centers will be led by an Assistant Director who will work with the capabilities and talents of all five Directorates on mission specific goals for the parts of the world which they are given responsibility for.|$|E

500|$|Illegality {{is one of}} {{the three}} broad {{headings}} of judicial review of administrative action identified in the key English case of Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ("the GCHQ case", 1983), the others being irrationality and procedural impropriety. As Singapore inherited English administrative law on independence and the Singapore courts continue to follow English cases, the Court of Appeal of Singapore approved this principle in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988). In the GCHQ case, Lord Diplock formulated the concept of illegality as one where [...] "the decision-maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and must give effect to it." [...] Where the decision-maker fails to do so, the High Court may <b>be</b> <b>empowered</b> to quash the decision made or the action taken. Determining whether a decision-maker has acted illegally requires [...] "delineating the scope of statutory powers, which is rarely a mechanistic exercise".|$|E
500|$|Believing {{that the}} chief justice should be {{responsible}} for the federal courts, Taft felt that he should have an administrative staff to assist him, and the chief justice should <b>be</b> <b>empowered</b> to temporarily reassign judges. He also believed the federal courts had been ill-run. [...] Many of the lower courts had lengthy backlogs, as did the Supreme Court. Immediately on taking office, Taft made it a priority to confer with Attorney General Daugherty as to new legislation, and made his case before congressional hearings, in legal periodicals and in speeches across the country. When Congress convened in December 1921, a bill was introduced for 24 new judges, to empower the chief justice to move judges temporarily to eliminate the delays, and to have him chair a body consisting of the senior appellate judge of each circuit. Congress objected to some aspects, requiring Taft to get the agreement of the senior judge of each involved circuit before assigning a judge, but it in September 1922 passed the bill, and the Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges held its first meeting that December.|$|E
500|$|Singer {{described}} the Apt Pupils premise as a [...] "study in cruelty". He {{prepared for the}} film by reading books like the 1996 history book Hitler's Willing Executioners, which confirmed his beliefs that Nazi war criminals felt [...] "guiltless and matter-of-fact about what they did". He referred to how young Todd Bowden's interactions with Nazi war criminal Kurt Dussander start to affect him: [...] "I {{liked the idea of}} the infectious nature of evil... The notion that anybody has the capacity within them to be cruel if motivated properly is, I think, a scary concept." [...] The director also perceived the film as not about the Holocaust, believing that the Nazi war criminal could have been replaced by one of Pol Pot's executioners or a mass murderer from Russia. [...] "It wasn't about fascism or National Socialism. It was about cruelty and the ability to do awful deeds, to live with them and <b>be</b> <b>empowered</b> by them," [...] Singer said. To this end, the director sought to avoid overt use of swastikas and other Nazi symbols. He was also attracted to the film as [...] " [...] idea that the collective awfulness of this terrible thing that happened decades ago in Europe had somehow crept up across the ocean and through time, like a golem, into this beautiful Southern California suburban neighborhood".|$|E

500|$|NPR writer Linda Holmes {{challenged}} the show's assertions of female empowerment. Finding the episode itself [...] "silly {{and full of}} bad dialogue" [...] and [...] "cheesy more than offensive", Holmes questioned how a series about women whose conduct and appearance were micromanaged could simultaneously claim that those regimented women were uniformly empowered by the experience. She opined that [...] "you can shake a Bunny tail and <b>be</b> <b>empowered,</b> no argument. It depends on what's {{going on in the}} rest of your life. But shaking a Bunny tail isn't enough to demonstrate empowerment if {{you have to go to}} Eddie Cibrian or Hugh Hefner for help every time you have a problem, and having the right not to be slapped on the behind when you deliver a cocktail isn't exactly a societal advance on the order of universal suffrage." [...] The series, she concluded, might have been better served had those involved positioned it as a camp soap opera and not tried to make a feminist statement. In concurrence, Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized Hefner's narration, deeming it as delusional and stupid, and criticize the series for its stance on feminism. She wrote, [...] "The show wants things both ways: to glamorize the Playboy 'lifestyle' from a male point of view and also to try to persuade us that, although Bunnydom had its hardships and rigors—no gum chewing, constant smiling—wearing an uncomfortable skimpy uniform and putting a poufy fake tail on your butt meant you held the keys to the universe." [...] Television Blend's Kelly West was much more optimistic about the episode, and asserted that [...] "The Playboy Club offers a lot of shiny things to look at, but beyond that, there is a story beginning to develop and characters that, while not quite as original as they are nice to look at, are interesting and charismatic enough to carry the series." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said the Playboy brand and the lifestyle portrayed in the series was dated and uninterestingm calling it a [...] "bad show, period. The writing was weak, the acting spotty and the sexism too ridiculous and obvious to comment on more than once." [...] Alan Pergament, former critic for The Buffalo News, said of the show that [...] "the truth is [...] should have been a pay-cable series because without the sex it is pretty boring and tame." ...|$|E
