5|$|The Admiralty's 1905 draft <b>building</b> <b>plan</b> envisioned four battleships in the 1906–1907 Naval Programme, {{but the new}} Liberal {{government}} cut one {{of these}} ships in mid-1906. The Bellerophon-class design was a slightly larger and improved version of the revolutionary preceding , with better underwater protection and a more powerful secondary armament.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} of the British battleship Dreadnought with her all big-gun-armament and steam turbines in 1906 meant that these ships were obsolete even before they were completed. The IJN recognized that fact when it drew up the first iteration of its Eight-Eight Fleet <b>building</b> <b>plan</b> for eight first-class battleships and eight battlecruisers in 1910 and did not include them.|$|E

5|$|Culverhouse was {{described}} as late as 1982 as a rare owner who was popular with players, coaches, and fans. He was commended for allowing his staff to handle football operations without interference, and for having the patience to allow John McKay {{to follow through with}} his <b>building</b> <b>plan</b> despite the franchise's 0–26 start. This changed after events surrounding the 1982 players' strike. A report issued by the National Football League Players Association {{prior to the start of}} negotiations revealed that the Buccaneers had the fifth-highest gross income of all NFL teams, while their average salary was only the 21st-highest. This directly contradicted statements made by Culverhouse in 1980, in which he told players that they were on one of the three highest-paid teams. The NFLPA figures showed that the Buccaneers were actually the third lowest-paying team, based on total salaries as a percentage of gross income. Culverhouse was then accused of trying to divide the players during the strike, when some of the team's assistant coaches contacted players to ask whether they would be willing to return to the team should training facilities be reopened.|$|E
5|$|In 444 BC, the {{conservative}} {{and the democratic}} factions confronted {{each other in a}} fierce struggle. The ambitious new leader of {{the conservative}}s, Thucydides (not {{to be confused with the}} historian of the same name), accused Pericles of profligacy, criticizing the way he spent the money for the ongoing <b>building</b> <b>plan.</b> Thucydides initially managed to incite the passions of the ecclesia regarding these charges in his favor. However, when Pericles took the floor, his resolute arguments put Thucydides and the conservatives firmly on the defensive. Finally, Pericles proposed to reimburse the city for all questionable expenses from his private property, with the proviso that he would make the inscriptions of dedication in his own name. His stance was greeted with applause, and Thucydides was soundly, if unexpectedly, defeated. In 442BC, the Athenian public voted to ostracize Thucydides from the city for 10 years and Pericles was once again the unchallenged ruler of the Athenian political arena.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, {{a report}} by Waterman Environmental was publicised by Councillor Craig, which {{revealed}} that the land upon which the Abbey Mills Mosque would be built is considered to have a medium-to-high contamination risk. The site {{was used as a}} chemical works for at least 100years, and was decommissioned as such in the late 1980s. Craig was alleged to have obtained this information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and he called for the Environment Agency to be brought in and for the site to be shut down until an independent report was undertaken. According to Craig, the Waterman Report revealed that the original pre-remediation works had discovered soil and groundwater impact by mercury, lead, arsenic, oil, fuels, and asbestos fibres. There were methane and carbon dioxide land gas readings as well. Mosque officials have stated that allowing the development to proceed would benefit the community, as decontamination of the site is part of their <b>building</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|E

25|$|Henderson Land Development won {{a tender}} for {{a site in}} Sai Wan Ho for Grand Promenade with a land premium of HK$2.43billion in January 2001. Six months later, the {{developer}} successfully applied for and was granted permission to exclude the public transport terminus from the gross floor area in its <b>building</b> <b>plan.</b> Leung had exempted the area of a public transport terminus in the gross floor area calculation of the development. The effect was to allow the addition of 10,700 square meters to the project and doubling the number of apartments from 1,008 to 2,020, costing the government HK$125million in lost revenue. A November 2005 Audit Commission report criticised Leung for having exercised his discretionary power before conferring with other government departments, thus handing the developer additional revenues of HK$3.2billion {{in exchange for a}} land premium of $6million. Leung tabled a judicial review. The two sides reached a deal in May 2006 when the Commissioner dropped legal proceedings, and Leung abandoned his judicial review. The government drew fire for dropping its case.|$|E
500|$|It {{was from}} the alliance's {{treasury}} that Pericles drew the funds necessary to enable his ambitious <b>building</b> <b>plan,</b> centered on the [...] "Periclean Acropolis", which included the Propylaea, the Parthenon and the golden statue of Athena, sculpted by Pericles' friend, Phidias. In 449 BC Pericles proposed a decree allowing the use of 9,000 talents to finance the major rebuilding program of Athenian temples. Angelos Vlachos, a Greek Academician, points out the utilization of the alliance's treasury, initiated and executed by Pericles, {{as one of the}} largest embezzlements in human history; this misappropriation financed, however, some of the most marvellous artistic creations of the ancient world.|$|E

The failure of the Germans to agree to any sort of naval arms control caused the government to reinstate the third ship. The Admiralty took until 12 June 1907 to decide not to build one of them as a battlecruiser, in favour of a squadron of four homogeneous battleships. Three of these would be part of the St Vincent class, while the single battleship planned for the 1908–1909 Naval Programme was later authorised as [...]|$|E

500|$|By 1904, Brazil—the largest {{country in}} South America in both size and population—began to seriously {{consider}} upgrading its navy, which {{had fallen to}} third in total tonnage. Soaring demand for coffee and rubber brought an influx of tax revenue, used to begin a large naval <b>building</b> <b>plan.</b> The centerpiece of the new navy would be two [...] dreadnoughts built by the United Kingdom. The order for these powerful ships, designed to carry the heaviest armament {{in the world at}} the time, shocked Argentina and Chile, causing them to cancel the 1902 armament-limiting pact with immediate effect. Alarmed, the American ambassador to Brazil sent a cablegram to his Department of State, warning them of the destabilizing effects that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race.|$|E
500|$|Argentina {{and other}} {{countries}} attempted to avert a full-scale naval arms race by offering to purchase {{one of the two}} dreadnoughts. Brazil refused Argentina's offer. [...] After further tensions over the River Plate (Río de la Plata, literally [...] "Silver River") area and inflammatory newspaper editorials favoring dreadnoughts, Argentina went ahead with a massive naval <b>building</b> <b>plan.</b> After a drawn-out bidding process among fifteen shipyards from the United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy, Argentina ordered two [...] dreadnoughts with an option for a third from the United States. They also ordered twelve destroyers from three nations in Europe. With its major rival acquiring so many modern vessels, Chile wanted to respond as early as February 1906, but the country's naval plans were delayed by a major earthquake in 1906 and a financial depression in 1907 brought on by a drastic fall in the nitrate market.|$|E

After several expansions, Stanford University was commissioned in 1951 to create a master <b>building</b> <b>plan</b> to manage future growth. It suggested purchasing land and building an additional campus at the Garden City Airport's Hale Field, which was gradually being replaced by the Missoula County Airport, which was then southwest of town. The new school (now Sentinel High School) was opened in 1957. Initially the two campuses were separated between upper and lower classmen with upper classmen in the new school, but in 1965, the two campuses became separate high schools. In 1974, the private Loyola Sacred Heart Catholic High School was created from a merger of the all-girls Sacred Heart Academy (.1873) and the all-boys Loyola High School (.1912). In 1980, Missoula's third public high school, Big Sky, was established.|$|E
