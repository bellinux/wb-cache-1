5|$|<b>Bugle</b> rank {{consists}} of the Band Commander and eleven other senior cadets who are well respected in the band and have impeccable marching abilities. Each <b>bugle</b> rank member carries a <b>bugle</b> with a banner, but are never played during a performance. Together, the drum majors and <b>bugle</b> rank lead the band through the maneuvers on the field. In addition to their primary functions within the band, the bugles and maces also serve a military ceremonial function and are used to salute commissioned officers, much as a rifleman would salute with a rifle or a commander would salute with a sabre.|$|E
50|$|Optional or {{permanent}} instruments in these bands are flutes and piccolos, <b>bugles,</b> natural horns, valved <b>bugles</b> and brass instruments (soprano <b>bugles</b> and trumpets, cornets, horns, mellophones, baritones, sousaphones and contrabass <b>bugles).</b>|$|R

5|$|An investigative {{journalist}} whose articles notably relate to Daredevil, and the Kingpin. During the film, {{he goes on}} to uncover a lot of information about the two. Pantoliano was cast in March 2002. Urich works for the New York Post, rather than the Daily <b>Bugle</b> as in the comics, because the film rights to the <b>Bugle</b> were held by Sony Pictures at that time.|$|E
5|$|A rival Daily <b>Bugle</b> {{photographer}} who is exposed by Peter {{for creating a}} fake image of Spider-Man and is ready for revenge when he bonds with the symbiote, which turns him into monstrous being with the same spider-like powers.|$|E
5|$|Although he was {{originally}} assigned {{to play the}} <b>bugle,</b> Sergeant Cole repeatedly requested that his rating be changed from field musician to machine-gunner.

5|$|The grouchy and miserly owner/publisher of the Daily <b>Bugle</b> who despises Spider-Man. Nonetheless, {{he has a}} {{good side}} and pays Peter for photos of Spider-Man, and refuses to tell the Green Goblin the {{identity}} of the photographer.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Otto Octavius is {{preparing}} to attach an exoskeleton onto Alex O'Hirn's body, modeled after that of a rhinoceros. Though Octavius is wary about going through with the experiment, Hammerhead forces him to activate it. O'Hirn's body is surgically attached to the suit and is given immeasurable strength. Meanwhile, Peter Parker is at the Daily <b>Bugle</b> trying to ask out Betty Brant to his school's fall formal, despite their four-year age difference; she finally agrees to consider it and Peter hurries homeward, exhilarated, until he realizes he will need money for the date. He tells his best friend Harry about his plans at school the next day. Peter then receives a text message that his Aunt May is having lunch with Betty at the <b>Bugle.</b> Flash Thompson then gives Peter a noogie just before Peter runs off.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 19th century onwards the castle site {{was subject to}} {{considerable}} development. A new road – Upper <b>Bugle</b> Street – was built through the old bailey site, and various local council buildings constructed. Development continued after the Second World War, in which {{large parts of the}} city around the castle were significantly damaged by bombing.|$|E
50|$|Slide-piston and/or rotor-piston <b>bugles</b> {{were common}} into the mid-1970s, and many non-competitive parade corps still existed that used {{straight}} <b>bugles</b> and single-valved models.|$|R
50|$|As of November 2014, <b>Bugles</b> {{are sold}} as <b>Bugles</b> in the United States, Canada, China, Saudi Arabia and several more {{countries}} in Central America and the Caribbean.|$|R
50|$|Manufacture of horizontal-piston <b>bugles</b> ceased in the 1990s, as most <b>bugles</b> {{were being}} sold to DCI drum corps, which legalized two-valved {{vertical}} piston instruments in 1977 and three-valved instruments in 1987.|$|R
5|$|In Los Angeles, {{locations}} {{included the}} Natural History Museum (for the Columbia University lab where Peter is bitten and receives his powers), the Pacific Electricity Building (the Daily <b>Bugle</b> offices) and Greystone Mansion (for the interiors of Norman Osborn's home). In April, 4 of the Spider-Man costumes were stolen, and Sony {{put up a}} $25,000 reward for their return. They were recovered after 18 months and a former movie studio security guard and an accomplice were arrested. Production moved to New York City for two weeks, taking in locations such as the Queensboro Bridge, the exteriors of Columbia University's Low Memorial Library and the New York Public Library, and a rooftop garden in the Rockefeller Center. The crew returned to Los Angeles where production and filming ended in June. The Flatiron Building {{was used for the}} Daily <b>Bugle.</b>|$|E
5|$|J. Jonah Jameson is {{depicted}} as {{the publisher of the}} Daily <b>Bugle</b> and is Peter Parker's boss and as a harsh critic of Spider-Man, always saying negative things about the superhero in the newspaper. Despite his role as Jameson's publishing editor and confidant Robbie Robertson is always depicted as a supporter of both Peter Parker and Spider-Man.|$|E
5|$|Later, Peter {{goes to the}} lab {{where he}} meets up with Gwen, his close friend Eddie Brock (Benjamin Diskin), and the Conners.

Jonah Jameson (Daran Norris), though he is kicked out near immediately.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bugles</b> are fried in coconut oil, which {{contributes}} to their being {{significantly higher in}} saturated fat than similar snack foods, which are typically fried in soybean or other vegetable oils. <b>Bugles</b> contain no hydrogenated oils.|$|R
50|$|Many fire {{departments}} use cuff stripes {{as well as}} <b>bugles</b> or military style insignia on their dress uniforms. Typically, {{they are the same}} in number and color as the <b>bugles</b> / stars worn, but variations exist.|$|R
5|$|On the field, {{the band}} is led by three drum majors and the twelve members of <b>bugle</b> rank. Each drum major carries a mace and directs the band based on its {{movements}} and whistle commands during a drill. The head drum major is a Cadet Lieutenant Colonel, while the two side drum majors, the Infantry Band Drum Major and the Artillery Band Drum Major, are Cadet Majors.|$|E
5|$|A distant, mournful fanfare (A), {{played on}} a cornet {{representing}} a <b>bugle,</b> {{is followed by a}} brisk military march initiated by a duet for side drum and piccolo (B). A passage for brass precedes the introduction of a theme or leitmotif associated with the phantom Kijé which, after a reprise of the march and a C major crescendo, is repeated on tenor saxophone, an instrument relatively new to the orchestra at that time. The cornet fanfare then returns to close the movement.|$|E
5|$|Bulls have a loud vocalization {{consisting}} of screams known as bugling, {{which can be}} heard for miles. Bugling {{is often associated with}} an adaptation to open environments such as parklands, meadows, and savannas, where sound can travel great distances. Females are attracted to the males that <b>bugle</b> more often and have the loudest call. Bugling is most common early and late in the day {{and is one of the}} most distinctive sounds in nature, akin to the howl of the gray wolf.|$|E

50|$|Bermuda {{made several}} visits to her namesake, {{where she was}} {{presented}} {{with a number of}} silver objects, including a large bell — which was occasionally used as a font for Holy Water in the baptism of children of the crew — and four <b>bugles.</b> Two of the <b>bugles</b> later found their way into The Bermuda Regiment. Apart from the bell and the <b>bugles,</b> which were collected together by the Bermuda Maritime Museum at the former Bermuda Dockyard, the other items went missing following the ship's decommissioning.|$|R
