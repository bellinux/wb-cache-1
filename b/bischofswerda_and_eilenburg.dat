Regionalbahn trains also run between Cottbus and Falkenberg and line S4 of the Mitteldeutschland S-Bahn (Geithain-Leipzig-Hoyerswerda) also run between Falkenberg <b>and</b> <b>Eilenburg,</b> resulting in each case in services running approximately once an hour. Between Halle <b>and</b> <b>Eilenburg</b> Regionalbahn trains run every one or two hours.

50|$|The Wesenitz {{historically}} inhabited a {{large population}} of otters, which were hated by the fishermen. The otters been extinct until 1920, but revived in recent years due to conservation measures.

50|$|A {{number of}} long-distance trains {{ran on the}} Cottbus-Eilenburg section, {{continuing}} towards Leipzig, until 1990. For example, services between Frankfurt (Oder) and Frankfurt (Main) and between Cottbus and Erfurt. Similarly, there was an international express service from Leipzig to Kraków. Typical stops for long-distance services were Calau, Finsterwalde, Doberlug-Kirchhain, Falkenberg (Elster), Torgau <b>and</b> <b>Eilenburg.</b> The Eilenburg-Halle section, however, primarily served regional passenger and freight traffic, at least since 1945.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} served by one train service, {{operated}} by Vogtlandbahn. There is a regular service from Dresden to Zittau via <b>Bischofswerda,</b> Wilthen <b>and</b> Ebersbach.|$|R
50|$|The {{slow onset}} of {{economic}} recovery {{came to a}} sudden end with {{the start of the}} Seven Years' War. Virtually each male in Eilenburg had to serve in the armed forces. The city was occupied alternately by the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia. In the following years Eilenburg turned into an impoverished and dirty old town. At the end of the 18th century the economy stagnated <b>and</b> <b>Eilenburg</b> became an even more insignificant town.|$|R
5000|$|The {{state of}} Prussia was {{dissolved}} {{after the end}} of the Nazi era, and the new state of Saxony-Anhalt was established, with Delitzsch being a part of it. In 1953 the East German government dissolved the states. They were reestablished after the German reunification in 1990, but Delitzsch <b>and</b> <b>Eilenburg</b> (two districts made up of the former Delitzsch district) were initially given to Saxony instead of Saxony-Anhalt. The two districts again merged in 1994 and formed the present borders.|$|R
50|$|As of May 2017 {{there are}} hourly {{services}} to <b>Bischofswerda</b> <b>and</b> Dresden (lines RE 2 and RB 61 run by Vogtlandbahn), to Liberec (lines RE 2 and L 7 run by Vogtlandbahn), Varnsdorf-Rybniště/Seifhennersdorf (line L 7 run by Vogtlandbahn) and to Görlitz and Cottbus (line OE 65 run by Ostdeutsche Eisenbahn). Narrow gauge services to Kurort Oybin and/or Kurort Jonsdorf run five times daily during main tourist seasons, two times daily during off-season. On summer weekend days {{there are three}} additional pairs of trains, which makes a peak of up to eight daily trains on summer weekend days.|$|R
50|$|Burkau {{is in the}} {{northern}} part of the Bautzen district in a region rich of woods in Upper Lusatia. It is about 6 km away - in northern direction - from the city of <b>Bischofswerda</b> <b>and</b> about 16 km - in western direction - from the main city of the district - Bautzen. The inner German motorway A4 between Dresden and Görlitz is near the community and got two direct connections with it. The source of the Klosterwasser/Klóšterska woda is located in territory of Burkau/Porchow. Nearby in the hills of the western Lusatia there is the source of the Schwarze Elster - one of the most important rivers of this region.|$|R
50|$|Important {{towns in}} West Lusatia are Hoyerswerda, Kamenz, Königsbrück, Ohorn, Pulsnitz, Schwepnitz, Bernsdorf, Ruhland, Oßling, Haselbachtal, Elstra <b>and</b> <b>Bischofswerda.</b>|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the cuts}} to public {{transport}} funding {{adopted by the}} Saxon government in 2010, amounting to €24 million for 2011 and €35 million in 2012, at least a partial reduction in services between Halle <b>and</b> <b>Eilenburg</b> was considered by Zweckverband für den Nahverkehrsraum Leipzig (the Leipzig local transport association, ZVNL), but this was averted. Thus, the services on the route were maintained to Eilenburg. Nevertheless, the continuation of passenger services on this section is not certain. With the commissioning of the City Tunnel in Leipzig the ZVNL plans to discontinue all passenger transport services between <b>Eilenburg</b> <b>and</b> Halle {{and the future of}} the Eilenburg-Delitzsch section is to be examined. Thus the branch line to Leipzig would play an important role and would be used as the regular route. In contrast, Nahverkehrsservice Sachsen-Anhalt (Saxony-Anhalt local transport service) is planning to upgrade the track infrastructure from the current operating speed of up to 100 km/h to at least 120 km/h by 2015 and an increase of service frequency so that they run every 60 minutes.|$|R
50|$|Idrizaj played {{five games}} in the German NOFV-Oberliga Süd for FC <b>Eilenburg</b> <b>and</b> {{received}} a red card in his second game.|$|R
50|$|S-Bahn {{lines were}} planned from the Hauptbahnhof to Riesa and Großenhain {{on the route}} via Cossebaude. Only one line was planned on the four-track line via Radebeul to Coswig. The S 2 line would have alternated between Königsbrück and the airport (the last option was implemented). S-Bahn lines from <b>Bischofswerda</b> <b>and</b> Kamenz would have run on the main line via Dresden-Neustadt to Heidenau and end in Dohna on the Müglitz Valley Railway. Heidenau, Pirna and Bad Schandau were not {{considered}} as possible end points. The traffic concept had four S-Bahn lines on the main route, with its own S-Bahn tracks, which between them would have run every 7.5 minutes. However, these plans had already been rejected {{by the end of}} the 1990s. The S-Bahn line to Tharandt would have been extended to Freiberg, which has been partly realised since the timetable change of 9 December 2007 as the S 30 (now S 3).|$|R
50|$|East of Leipzig, the B6 (except of {{the ring}} roads around Meißen, Dresden <b>and</b> <b>Bischofswerda)</b> largely follows the {{historic}} course of the Via Regia Lusatiae Superioris, part of the medieval Via Regia.|$|R

50|$|Rinkart was a deacon at Eisleben <b>and</b> archdeacon at <b>Eilenburg,</b> {{where he}} was born and also died. He served there during the Thirty Years' War and a severe plague in 1637.|$|R

[...] The war ended in May 1945 which put an end to one-Party government. Wyschofsky joined the Communist Party. The next year, in April 1946 the contentious merger between the old Communist Party and the Moderate-left SPD created the precondition for a return to one-party rule, this time under Soviet administration across the whole of what was now the Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany. Wyschofsky was one of thousands of former Communists who now lost no time in signing their membership over to the new Socialist Unity Party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands, SED). Between 1946 and 1948 he pursued his studies at the Workers' and Farmers' Faculty (ABF / [...] ) in Halle. Next he studied Chemistry at the Dresden University of Technology and at the Karl-Marx University (as it was then known) in Leipzig, obtaining his degree in 1951.|$|R

50|$|The Bunzlauer style {{also has}} survived in the {{continuously}} functioning pot shops of former East Germany in the potting communities of Neukirch/Lausitz, <b>Bischofswerda,</b> Pulsnitz, <b>and</b> Königsbrück. The Upper Lusatian town of Königsbrück {{is home to}} the Frommhold Pottery, founded in 1851, the last survivor of 21 potteries once active in the community. The town of Neukirch has contained three active potteries to continue the tradition, that of the Kannegiesser family begun in 1824, that of Karl Louis Lehmann established in 1834, and the Heinke Pottery producing ware since 1866. Pulsnitz is the home of the Juergel Pottery, thought to have been responsible for first introducing the sponging technique and the peacock-eye motif into Lusatia.|$|R
