Ablation experiments were performed on polymethylmethacrylate used as cornea tissue simulator and PMMA intraocular lenses. The polymer-ablation mechanism was examined with two different wavelengths and pulse durations. The experiments were conducted with Nd:YAG and Er:YAG solid-state lasers, and the ablation rates were simulated by a mathematical model in each case. Furthermore, to investigate the role of tissue hydration during laser ablation, we performed a set of experiments in which Er:YAG laser ablation of hydrophilic acrylic intraocular lenses, with different H 2 O and D 2 O concentrations, was studied.

Therefore. modelling of light transport in tissue. for optimization of laser dosimetry, requires the development of simple theoretical models and the experimental implementation in tissue-simulating phantoms, with known optical and fluorescence properties. Low cost phantoms were used, based on agar dissolved ill water as the transparent matrix, The latter is loaded with various amounts of Intralipid and fluorophores as light scatterer and absorbers, respectively. The optical properties of these phantoms were measured at two different visible wavelengths. By comparing the fluorescence emission spectra of the turbid samples containing the saute fluorophore in different concentrations, we can calculate the concentration. In addition. the evaluation of the scattering and absorption co-efficients allow us to predict the spatial distribution of the light intensity inside and outside of the phantom.

40|$|The PhD activity, {{from which}} this thesis is taken, has been aimed at the design and {{development}} of optical components and subsystems for industrial and <b>biomedical</b> <b>laser</b> applications. Industrial-grade high-power laser market, traditionally dominated by gas and solid state lasers, is currently being revolutionized by two new devices, namely fiber and direct diode lasers, which are partly competing and partly complementary. On the one hand, Fiber Lasers (FLs) make use of rare-earth doped specialty fibers to converted the radiation from semiconductor laser modules (the "pump" source) into a high quality beam at an another wavelength; their strong point is the brightness enhancement, although at the expenses of the conversion efficiency. On the other hand, Direct Diode Lasers (DDLs) rely on the combination of semiconductor laser chips, {{similar to those used}} as pump for FLs, to achieve kilowatt-range output power, which is then delivered to the piece under treatment without the need of further conversion or processing; their strong point is the wall-plug efficiency, while the beam quality is typically low. Different applications may privilege one or the other technological approach: for instance, metal sheet cutting and industrial additive manufacturing from metal powders are more suited for FLs, whereas welding and brazing for DDLs. The first part of the PhD activity have been devoted to the design and development of high power laser systems, yielding to the all-fiber realization of a 600 W single-mode Yb-doped FL module and 500 W to 2000 W low-brightness DDLs. First, different architectural solutions have been investigated and optimized, considering feasibility issues, energy consumption and overall ownership costs. Then, key fiber components, such as fused fiber combiners, cladding mode strippers and laser end-caps, which are usually not commercially available being too dependent on the fiber characteristics and other application related constraints, have been designed fabricated and tested. These devices have been later used to assemble demonstrators of fiber and direct diode laser systems for industrial applications. The implemented FL has reached ~ 600 W of nearly single-modeoutput, with Beam Parameter Product (BPP) less than 0. 54 mm mrad. As for the DDL case, two demonstrators (~ 500 W power with BPP 44. 4 mm mrad and ~ 2 kW power with laser BPP 66. 5 mm mrad) have been realized and engineered. In all the cases, the output power has been limited to available diodes only. The second part of the PhD, and thus of the thesis, has been focused on the laser application in the biomedical field, and in particular to the laser ablation of solid tumors in liver and pancreas. Innovative applicators for laser tumor ablation with customized beam irradiation pattern and integrated all-optical temperature sensing capabilities have been designed and manufactured. The prototypes have been validated in liver phantoms (e. g. agar jelly and porcine livers), demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solution and encourage further developments toward clinical applications. It is important to highlight that during the PhD the entire chain from design to manufacturing, to applications, has been explored and this has allowed acquiring new skills in different areas, not strictly limited to the main topic of the thesi...|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{spectroscopy}} {{has recently}} been extended from a contact-probe to wide-area spectroscopic imaging to enable mapping of optical properties across a wide area of tissue. We train quantitative spectroscopic imaging (QSI) to identify cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) in 34 subjects undergoing the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP subjects). QSI’s performance is then prospectively evaluated on the clinically suspicious biopsy sites from 47 subjects undergoing colposcopic-directed biopsy. The results show the per-subject normalized reduced scattering coefficient at 700 nm (A[subscript n]) and the total hemoglobin concentration are significantly different (p< 0. 05) between HSIL and non-HSIL sites in LEEP subjects. A[subscript n] alone retrospectively distinguishes HSIL from non-HSIL with 89 % sensitivity and 83 % specificity. It alone applied prospectively on the biopsy sites distinguishes HSIL from non-HSIL with 81 % sensitivity and 78 % specificity.

40|$|Background and Objective Optical {{clearing}} agents (OCAs) {{have shown}} promise {{for increasing the}} penetration depth of <b>biomedical</b> <b>lasers</b> by temporarily decreasing optical scattering within the skin. However, their translation to the clinic has been constrained by lack of practical means for effectively perfusing OCA within target tissues in vivo. The objective {{of this study was}} to address this limitation through combination of a variety of techniques to enhance OCA perfusion, including heating of OCA, microneedling and/or application of pneumatic pressure over the skin surface being treated (vacuum and/or positive pressure). While some of these techniques have been explored by others independently, the current study represents the first to explore their use together. Study Design/Materials and Methods Propylene glycol (PG) OCA, either at room-temperature or heated to 45 °C, was topically applied to hydrated, body temperature ex vivo porcine skin, in conjunction with various combinations of microneedling pre-treatment (0. 2 mm length microneedles, performed prior to OCA application), vacuum pre-treatment (17 - 50 kPa, performed prior to OCA application), and positive pressure post-treatment (35 - 172 kPa, performed after OCA application). The effectiveness of OCA perfusion was characterized via measurements of transmittance, reduced scattering coefficient, and penetration depth at a number of medically-relevant laser wavelengths across the visible spectrum. Results Topical application of room-temperature (RT) PG led to an increase in transmittance across the visible spectrum of up to 21 % relative to untreated skin. However, only modest increases were observed with addition of various combinations of microneedling pre-treatment, vacuum pre-treatment, and positive pressure post-treatment. Conversely, when heated PG was used in conjunction with these techniques, we observed significant increases in transmittance. Using an optimal PG perfusion enhancement protocol consisting of 45 °C heated PG + microneedle pre-treatment + 35 kPa vacuum pre-treatment + 103 kPa positive pressure post-treatment, we observed up to 68 % increase in transmittance relative to untreated skin, and up to 46 % increase relative to topical RT PG application alone. Using the optimal PG perfusion enhancement protocol, we also observed up to 30 % decrease in reduced scattering coefficient relative to untreated skin, and up to 20 % decrease relative to topical RT PG alone. Finally, using the optimal protocol, we observed up to 25 % increase in penetration depth relative to untreated skin, and up to 23 % increase relative to topical RT PG alone. Conclusions The combination of heated PG, microneedling pre-treatment, vacuum pre-treatment, and positive pressure-post treatment were observed to significantly enhance the perfusion of topically applied PG. Although further studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of combined perfusion enhancement techniques in vivo, the current results suggest promise for facilitating the translation of OCAs to the clinic. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Photoacoustic (PA) imaging {{has emerged}} as a {{powerful}} tool for various biomedical studies, such as molecular imaging of biomarkers, functional imaging of physi-ological parameters, and gene expression products[1 – 3]. PA tomography (PAT) is based on the PA effect which refers to the generation of acoustic waves by the ab-sorption of electromagnetic energy, such as optical, radio-frequency, or microwave energy[4 – 8]. In <b>biomedical</b> applications, <b>laser</b> pulses are delivered into biological tissue. Some of delivered energy will be absorbed and converted into heat, leading to transient thermoelastic expansion and thus wideband acoustic wave emission. The generated acoustic waves are then detected by ultrasound transducer to reconstruct images. PAT has ultrasonic resolution with high tissue contrast due to optical absorption. In addition, compared with other optical imaging, PAT has deeper penetration depth, and provides high resolution at relatively large imaging depth. For the conventional scanning PAT system, more number of measurements are required to obtain high-resolution images, which imply long data acquisition time and high-cost system. Significant efforts have been made to address this problem, one key approach is to explore the sparsity of PA images and reconstruct the images from limited view acquisitions[9 – 13].

Although laser cutting as a method to produce micro electrodes {{in a range of}} biomedical applications is not new {{there is a lack of}} comprehensive measurements, especially comparing the use of nanosecond and femtosecond lasers. Both lasers were used to cut grooves into Ni-Ti and Pt to test their use in producing high density micro electrode arrays. Various grooves depths were produced using multiple laser passes. The nanosecond laser was found to have a significant higher cutting efficiency than the femtosecond laser. It was also found that the melt produced by the nanosecond laser had a significant impact on the groove geometry. The work presented here shows that nanosecond lasers are preferred for rapid production of shallow groves but femtosecond laser cutting is preferred for deep groove cutting. Feedthroughs in the walls of implanted biomedical devices are required to carry electrical signals to the device. Biocompatible materials such as alumina and platinum must be used for the wall and feedthrough respectively and the feedthrough must be sealed hermetically. According to the literature these two materials only bond if heat and contact pressure is used. Because of the delicate nature of the device, four methods to bond alumina to platinum substrates were trialled without using contact pressure. All methods produced alumina films that adhered well to the platinum substrate. The best film was found to be produced by atomic layer deposition.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in performing quantitative biological studies using Raman spectroscopy lies in overcoming {{the influence of}} the dominant sample fluorescence background. Moreover, the prediction accuracy of a calibration model can be severely compromised by the quenching of the endogenous fluorophores due to the introduction of spurious correlations between analyte concentrations and fluorescence levels. Apparently, functional models can be obtained from such correlated samples, which cannot be used successfully for prospective prediction. This work investigates the deleterious effects of photobleaching on prediction accuracy of implicit calibration algorithms, particularly for transcutaneous glucose detection using Raman spectroscopy. Using numerical simulations and experiments on physical tissue models, we show that the prospective prediction error can be substantially larger when the calibration model is developed on a photobleaching correlated dataset compared to an uncorrelated one. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the application of shifted subtracted Raman spectroscopy (SSRS) reduces the prediction errors obtained with photobleaching correlated calibration datasets compared to those obtained with uncorrelated ones.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of exciton-plasmon coupling and {{the conversion of}} exciton-plasmon-photon have been widely investigated experimentally and theoretically. In this review, we introduce the exciton-plasmon interaction from basic principle to applications. There {{are two kinds of}} exciton-plasmon coupling, which demonstrate different optical properties. The strong exciton-plasmon coupling results in two new mixed states of light and matter separated energetically by a Rabi splitting that exhibits a characteristic anticrossing behavior of the exciton-LSP energy tuning. Compared to strong coupling, such as surface-enhanced Raman scattering, surface plasmon (SP) -enhanced absorption, enhanced fluorescence, or fluorescence quenching, there is no perturbation between wave functions; the interaction here is called the weak coupling. SP resonance (SPR) arises from the collective oscillation induced by the electromagnetic field of light and can be used for investigating the interaction between light and matter beyond the diffraction limit. The study on the interaction between SPR and exaction has drawn wide attention since its discovery not only due to its contribution in deepening and broadening the understanding of SPR but also its contribution to its application in light-emitting diodes, solar cells, low threshold <b>laser,</b> <b>biomedical</b> detection, quantum information processing, and so on...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{its high}} melting point and low weight, TiAl alloys have been {{developed}} as the promising high temperature structural materials for future transportation applications, especially suitable for structural parts with complex geometry in aircraft. However, lacking of ductility at room temperature makes it a typical difficult-to-cut material by conventional material-removal manufacturing methods. Additive manufacturing (AM), which has completely different materials incremental manufacturing philosophy and could produce parts layer by layer via consolidation/deposition of powder or wire feedstock, offers a brand new and convenient means to manufacture complex structural components for hard materials. Currently, one the main applications of AM is to design and manufacture critical functional metallic components with complicated geometry for metals, alloys and even metal matrix composites (MMCs), to satisfy the ever-improving requirements in the aerospace, automotive and <b>biomedical</b> industries. <b>Laser</b> engineering net-shaping (LENS), based {{on a kind of}} directed energy deposition (DED), is one of the popular AM technologies for complex metal structural component production. It could fabricate complex, fully dense metal components from CAD files directly without using dies, tooling or machining, which greatly reduce the lead-time and production cost. However, accurate numerical modelling of LENS process is a real challenge due to the involvement of multiple physical processes as well as accompanied mass and heat flows. In this paper, the deposition process of TiAL alloys with LENS is reported. The thermal behaviours of substrate and as-deposited layer/track during the LENS process are investigated by using FEM and phase field modelling. Temperature field distributions caused by the moving laser beam and the resultant molten pool on the substrate, are simulated and compared. Interaction between the laser and the powder particles, which make the powder particles temperature raise and the laser power irradiating to the substrate partially reduced, are also considered. The research offers a more accurate and practical thermal behavior model for LENS of TiAl; it will be particularly useful for key components manufacturing in the field of aerospace which has more demanding requirement on their functional performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A rate-equation {{analysis}} of the erbium 3 -m ZBLAN fiber laser is performed. The computer calculation includes the longitudinal spatial resolution of the host material. It considers ground-state bleaching, excited-state absorption (ESA), interionic processes, lifetime quenching by co-doping, and stimulated emis-sion at 2. 7 m and 850 nm. State-of-the-art technology including double-clad diode pumping is assumed in the calculation. Pump ESA is identified as the major problem of this laser. With high Er 3 + concentration, suitable Pr 3 + co-doping, and low pump den-sity, ESA is avoided and a diode-pumped erbium 3 -m ZBLAN laser is predicted which is capable of emitting a transversely single-mode output power of 1. 0 W when pumped with 7 -W incident power at 800 nm. The corresponding output intensity which is relevant for surgical applications {{will be in the}} range of 1. 8 MW/cm 2. Compared to Ti:sapphire-pumped cascade-lasing regimes, the proposed approach represents a strong decrease of the requirements on mirror coatings, cavity alignment, and especially pump intensity. Of the possible drawbacks investigated in the simulation, only insufficient lifetime quenching is found to have a significant influence on laser performance.

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{systematic}} {{characterization of the}} nanosecond ground-state lactam-lactim tautomerization of pyridine derivatives in aqueous solution under ambient conditions using temperature-jump transient 2 D IR spectroscopy. Although electronic excited-state tautomerization has been widely studied, experimental work on the ground electronic state, most relevant to chemistry and biology, is lacking. Using 2 D IR spectroscopy, lactam and lactim tautomers of 6 - chloro- 2 -pyridoneand 2 -chloro- 4 -pyridone are unambiguously identified by their unique cross-peak patterns. Monitoring the correlated exponential relaxation of these signals {{in response to a}} laser temperature jump provides a direct measurement of the nanosecond tautomerization kinetics. By studying the temperature, concentration, solvent, and pH dependence, we extract a thermodynamic and kinetic characterization and conclude that the tautomerization proceeds through a two-state concerted mechanism. We find that the intramolecular proton transfer is mediated by bridging water molecules and there action barrier is dictated by the release of a proton from pyridone, as would be expected for an efficient Grothuss-type proton transfer mechanism.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of severely atrophied posterior mandibles with standard-diameter root-form implants may present a challenge. Bone reconstructive surgery represents the {{treatment of}} choice; however, {{it may not be}} accepted by some patients for economic reasons or due to higher morbidity. Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technologies have recently opened new frontiers in <b>biomedical</b> applications. Selective <b>laser</b> sintering (SLS) is a CAD/CAM technique that allows the fabrication of complex three-dimensional (3 D) structures created by computer-generated image-based design techniques. The aim {{of this study is to}} present a protocol for the manufacture and clinical use of custom-made SLS titanium blade implants as a non-conventional therapeutic treatment for the prosthetic rehabilitation of extremely atrophied posterior mandibles. Computed tomography datasets of five patients were transferred to a specific reconstruction software, where a 3 D projection of the atrophied mandible was obtained, and custom-made endosseous blade implants were designed. The custom-made implants were fabricated with SLS technique, placed in the extremely atrophied posterior (< 4  mm width) mandible, and immediately restored with fixed partial restorations. After 2  years of loading, all implants were in function, showing a good esthetic integration. Blade implants can be fabricated on an individual basis as a custom-designed device. This non-conventional approach may represent an option for restoring the atrophied posterior mandible of elderly patients. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} of bubbles with rigid and free boundaries {{have been well}} documented. Toroidal bubble formation has been observed, with jetting directed toward {{and away from the}} two types of interface respectively. This work generalises these interactions by studying the effect of a two fluid interface supporting a density discontinuity. Such interactions may provide significant new insight into the mechanisms present in bubble assisted mixing processes, and in <b>biomedical</b> procedures including <b>laser</b> ablation and sonoporation. A numerical investigation has been conducted to examine the essentially incompressible fluid dynamics of the exterior liquid layers, based on a boundary integral implementation coupled with the vortex ring toroidal bubble model [53]. The transition through the null impulse state has been investigated, demonstrating excellent agreement with the water/white spirit experiments of Chahine and Bovis [23]. Close standoff distance simulations have illustrated the retardation of surface spiking with increasing density ratios, and have shown how the toroidal phase can be beneficial to mixing processes. Multi-bubble simulations have demonstrated that the deformation to the interface is greatly affected by the configuration of the bubble column. The acoustic driving of ultrasound contrast agents near tissue layers has also been investigated, demonstrating a new mechanism for tissue damage due to the toroidal re-expansion, the membrane peeling phenomenon.
