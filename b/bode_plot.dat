25|$|Bode {{was one of}} {{the great}} {{engineering}} philosophers of his era. Long respected in academic circles worldwide, he is also widely known to modern engineering students mainly for developing the asymptotic magnitude and phase plot that bears his name, the <b>Bode</b> <b>plot.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{is also an}} {{experimental}} method of characterizing electrochemical systems. This technique measures the impedance of a system over a range of frequencies, and therefore the frequency response of the system, including the energy storage and dissipation properties, is revealed. Often, data obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is expressed graphically in a <b>Bode</b> <b>plot</b> or a Nyquist plot.|$|E

25|$|When viewed on a {{logarithmic}} <b>Bode</b> <b>plot,</b> {{the response}} slopes off linearly towards negative infinity. A first-order filter's response rolls off at −6 dB per octave (−20 dB per decade) (all first-order lowpass filters {{have the same}} normalized frequency response). A second-order filter decreases at −12 dB per octave, a third-order at −18 dB and so on. Butterworth filters have a monotonically changing magnitude function with ω, unlike other filter types that have non-monotonic ripple in the passband and/or the stopband.|$|E
2500|$|The {{logarithmic}} scale {{nature of the}} decibel means that a very large range of ratios can be represented by a convenient number, {{in a similar manner}} to scientific notation. This allows one to clearly visualize huge changes of some quantity. See <b>Bode</b> <b>plot</b> and semi-log plot. [...] For example, 120dB SPL may be clearer than [...] "a trillion times more intense than the threshold of hearing".|$|E
2500|$|Linear {{control theory}} – This applies to systems made of devices which obey the {{superposition}} principle, which means roughly that the output {{is proportional to}} the input. [...] They are governed by linear differential equations. [...] A major subclass is systems which in addition have parameters which do not change with time, called linear time invariant (LTI) systems. [...] These systems are amenable to powerful frequency domain mathematical techniques of great generality, such as the Laplace transform, Fourier transform, Z transform, <b>Bode</b> <b>plot,</b> root locus, and Nyquist stability criterion. [...] These lead to a description of the system using terms like bandwidth, frequency response, eigenvalues, gain, resonant frequencies, poles, and zeros, which give solutions for system response and design techniques for most systems of interest.|$|E
50|$|These {{conditions}} {{can be expressed}} in mathematical terms using the Nyquist plot. Another method used in control loop theory uses <b>Bode</b> <b>plots</b> of gain and phase vs. frequency. Using <b>Bode</b> <b>plots,</b> a design engineer checks {{whether there is a}} frequency where both conditions for oscillations are met: the phase is zero (positive feedback) and the loop gain is 1 or greater.|$|R
40|$|<b>Bode</b> <b>plots,</b> {{corrected}} for Ohmic resistance, logarithmic {{plots of}} the imaginary {{component of the}} impedance, and effective capacitance plots are shown to be useful complements to the more traditionally used complex-plane and Bode representations for electrochemical impedance data. The graphical methods are illustrated by synthetic data and by experimental data associated with corrosion in saline environments. <b>Bode</b> <b>plots</b> are shown, in particular, to be confounded by the influence of electrolyte resistance. The plots proposed here provide useful guides to model development for both reactive and blocking systems. The logarithmic plots of the imaginary component of the impedance and effective capacitance plots are useful for all impedance data, and the correction for Ohmic resistance in <b>Bode</b> <b>plots</b> is useful when the solution resistance is not negligible...|$|R
25|$|Numerous tools {{exist for}} the {{analysis}} of the poles of a system. These include graphical systems like the root locus, <b>Bode</b> <b>plots</b> or the Nyquist plots.|$|R
2500|$|Next, {{the choice}} of pole ratio τ1/τ2 {{is related to the}} phase margin of the {{feedback}} amplifier. where the gain flips sign, and this never happens in a two-pole system. If we know f180 for the amplifier at hand, the gain margin can be found approximately, but f180 then depends on the third and higher pole positions, as does the gain margin, unlike the estimate of phase margin, which is a two-pole estimate. [...] The procedure outlined in the <b>Bode</b> <b>plot</b> article is followed. Figure 5 is the Bode gain plot for the two-pole amplifier in the range of frequencies up to the second pole position. The assumption behind Figure 5 is that the frequency f0dB lies between the lowest pole at f1=1/(2πτ1) and the second pole at f2=1/(2πτ2). As indicated in Figure 5, this condition is satisfied for values ofα≥1.|$|E

Corrosion of zinc in acid media results in the increase in roughness of the metal surface, which causes decrease in the phase angle. It was seen from the <b>Bode’s</b> <b>plot</b> that phase angle increased with increase in both inhibitor concentration and temperature. The data further support the progressive adsorption of inhibitor on the metal surface, which blocks the active sites, thereby reducing the corrosion rate.|$|R
