Brown's endorsement of Nixon during the 1972 presidential election negatively impacted his career during that period with several national Black organizations boycotting his records and protesting at his concert shows. Brown stated he was neither Democratic nor Republican despite his support of Republican presidents such as Nixon and Ronald Reagan. In 1999, when being interviewed by Rolling Stone, the magazine asked him to name a hero in the 20th century; Brown mentioned John F. Kennedy and 96-year-old, former Dixiecrat Senator Strom Thurmond, stating [...] "when the young whippersnappers get out of line, whether Democratic or Republican, an old man can walk up and say 'Wait a minute, son, it goes this way.'

5000|$|The Chief Inspector {{of prisons}} claims English and Welsh prisons have become unacceptably violent and dangerous.Juliet Lyon of the Prison Reform Trust, {{claimed it was}} [...] "no mystery that violence, self-harm and suicide rise when you overcrowd prisons, reduce staff by almost one-third, cut time out of cell and {{purposeful}} activity". [...] Mark Day, also of the Prison Reform Trust, stated, [...] "Today's figures reveal a hidden emergency unfolding in our prison system. This cannot be allowed to become the new normal." [...] Frances Crook of the Howard League for Penal Reform said, [...] "I have <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> and I don't think I have ever seen prisons {{in such a state}} ... terms of overcrowding, murders, suicides, prisoner self-harm and assaults on staff." [...] Cook claims prisons are overcrowded and understaffed due to Chris Grayling (formerly in charge of the Ministry of Justice) closing prisons, closing prison wings and cutting prison staff. [...] There is concern that not enough is being done to prevent suicides among vulnerable women prisoners. Nigel Newcomen, Prisons and Probation Ombudsman said, “I find it disheartening that many of the lessons we identify to prevent women in custody from taking their own lives repeat those in previous publications from my office. This suggests it is not knowledge that is the issue, but a lack of concerted and sustained action.” Suicides among women prisoners have risen, there was good care from some prison staff but there were, “weak practice” and “basic failings”. There was also lack of coordination between mental health services and prison staff. Self-harm was sometimes punished. Prison suicides in 2016 at 119 were the highest since records began. This is the highest number since 1978. Professor Pamela Taylor of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' forensic faculty, said that the prison estates' mental health teams were understaffed and struggling to help prisoners in [...] "desperate need". [...] Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP) research revealed prison psychiatrists are so frightened many cannot give basic care. There are assaults on psychiatrists and as many as 30 healthcare appointments daily are cancelled in some prisons due to lack of prison officers to escort staff between cells and clinics. Large scale resignations of psychiatrists are feared mainly due to safety concerns as in some prisons there will be only one staff member to 50 inmates.|$|E
