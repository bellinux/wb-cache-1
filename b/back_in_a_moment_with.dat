6000|$|... "Come!" [...] cried Carthoris. [...] "There {{is no time}} to be lost. Astok will be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> enough warriors to {{overpower}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. McWilliams sped to {{the nursery}} {{to see how things}} were going on there. She was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> a new dread. She said: ...|$|E
6000|$|How {{dramatic}} it all was, as Ailie said frequently afterwards. She was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> {{her hand}} on her heart. [...] "Mr. Sandys," [...] were her astounding words, [...] "a lady wants to see you." ...|$|E
60|$|He came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to {{say that}} Barker was in the garden.|$|R
60|$|LADY CHILTERN. I will be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> I am {{only going}} to take my hat off.|$|R
60|$|At {{these words}} the whole {{audience}} burst into riotous applause, during which Loring disappeared, {{but he was}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R
6000|$|About six o'clock, {{the time}} {{announced}} for the ceremony, I elbowed {{my way through}} the expectant throng of men, women, and children that already besieged the smith's door. Shrill demands of [...] "Toss, toss!" [...] rent the air every time Jess's head showed on the window-blind, and Andra hoped, as I pushed open the door, [...] "that I hadna forgotten my bawbees." [...] Weddings were celebrated among the Auld Lichts by showers of ha'pence, and the guests {{on their way to the}} bride's house had to scatter to the hungry rabble like housewives feeding poultry. Willie Todd, the best man, who had never come out so strong in his life before, slipped through the back window, while the crowd, led on by Kitty McQueen, seethed in front, and making a bolt for it to the [...] "'Sosh," [...] was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> a handful of small change. [...] "Dinna toss ower lavishly at first," [...] the smith whispered me nervously, as we followed Jess and Willie into the darkening wynd.|$|E
60|$|Cass melted. He moved. Miss Porter put {{her head}} out of the window and drew it <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> dry-eyed.|$|R
6000|$|I confounded Brett's man, {{and told}} the boy to bid him call again. Young Larkins came {{grinning}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I will be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> good mother,' said he. And {{three minutes}} later he placed a purse full of sequins in the old woman's hand.|$|R
60|$|LIZA [forcing {{a little}} smile for him through her vexation] Oh well, just to show there's no ill feeling. I'll be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> [She goes out].|$|R
6000|$|... "It's your cousin, miss, {{from the}} country, {{and she has}} a trunk with her. Of course she's to come in?" [...] asked Maria, coming <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "They will be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> It {{is absurd}} to doubt either of them, Ducaine. Yet I shall keep silent. I have an idea. Agree to {{everything}} I say." ...|$|R
60|$|The injured gondoliers {{spoke in}} low tones together; {{then one of}} them shrugged his {{shoulders}} and went out. He came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and laid <b>a</b> rope before the commissary.|$|R
60|$|At {{those last}} words, Mr. Bashwood {{suddenly}} rallied. The lawyer's passing {{reference to the}} great house had led him <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to the purpose that he had in view.|$|R
6000|$|GLORIA (annoyed). Mother will be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> Phil. (Severely.) Please {{wait here}} for her. (She turns {{away to the}} window, where she stands looking out {{with her back to}} them.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} it then. Ring for our boots {{and tell them}} to order a cab. I'll be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> when I have changed my dressing-gown and filled my cigar-case." ...|$|R
60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. With the {{greatest}} pleasure. [To MRS. ALLONBY.] I'll be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> People's mothers always bore me to death. All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy.|$|R
6000|$|... "An enchanted prince or princess," [...] said Prigio, [...] "such as I {{have often}} read of. Who can it be? Not Jaqueline; she could change herself <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> By the way, where is Jaqueline?" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{neither he}} nor the girl changed their {{positions}} relatively for a long time. At length, however, after peering into the woods, and listening, he remarked to the girl {{that he would be}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and then walked off around the spruces.|$|R
6000|$|... "Amen to that, my child," [...] {{concluded}} Madame fervently. [...] "And now, my dear, don't let me {{forget the}} hour of my audience. Hector will be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two, and I must not lose any more time gossiping. But before I go, little one, {{will you tell me}} one thing?" ...|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{laid down}} her knitting-work, and was <b>in</b> the <b>back</b> porch <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R
6000|$|With this {{he turned}} and left the room, but was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> [...] "It was a woman," [...] he said, [...] "who {{was at the bottom}} of it. It is always a woman, you know, and I am sure you will excuse me now that you know this. And you must let me begin {{wherever}} you may be in the dinner." ...|$|R
60|$|He came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> so much amazed, {{that she}} could see the whites all round his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|So {{the pony}} was led out. Alberic laid {{one hand on}} its mane, and vaulted on its <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Both Osmond and Richard broke out loudly into admiration. [...] "Oh, this is nothing!" [...] said Alberic. [...] "Bertrand says it is nothing. Before he grew old and stiff he could spring into the saddle in this manner fully armed. I ought to do this much better." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Travers' hand {{remained}} firmly {{closed on}} the ring. [...] "Yes, that will do," [...] she murmured, hastily. [...] "I'll be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Get everything ready." [...] With those words she disappeared inside the deckhouse and presently threads of light appeared in the interstices of the boards. Mrs. Travers had lighted <b>a</b> candle <b>in</b> there. She was busy hanging that ring round her neck. She was going. Yes--taking the risk for Tom's sake.|$|R
60|$|He {{glanced at}} the Captain, who nodded <b>back.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> the Doctor reappeared. He leaned down and whispered to the Captain.|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as he}} {{had brought}} home the post-bag, he dashed across the road again, but came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> looking beside himself.|$|R
60|$|She hurried away, {{and came}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> having evidently dried some tears, perhaps of thankfulness, but she paused as if {{reluctant}} to begin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is a {{shame to}} his calling," [...] I acknowledged. Then--"Get me a needle and a length of thread," [...] said I. She scuttled off to do my bidding, like {{nothing so much as}} one of the rats that tenanted her unclean sty. She was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> all servility, and {{wondering}} whether there was a rent about me she might make bold to stitch. What a key to courtesy is gold, my masters! I drove her out, and eager to conciliate me, she went at once.|$|R
60|$|Ellison came hurrying <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> {{and looked}} in vain for his companion. As he stood there {{watching}} the throng of people, Berenice called him to her.|$|R
60|$|Here Mary Erskine {{suddenly}} {{laid her}} head down upon her arms again, on the little work-table before her, and burst into tears. After sobbing convulsively a few minutes she rose, hastily brushed the tears away with her handkerchief, and went toward the door. She then took the water pail, which stood upon a bench near the door, {{and said that she}} was going to get some water, at the spring, for tea, and that she would be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> She returned very soon, with a countenance entirely serene.|$|R
25|$|Fanta and Pain's mother, an {{extremely}} powerful faerie {{even after a}} liaison with a human man and the previous Faerie of Affinity. Oran was originally a candidate to be Queen of Avalon, but a jealous rival named Seraphina tricked her {{when the two of}} them went to earth to bathe. Oran was left on earth with a torn gown and married a human man after she was raped and lost her memory. Though having three children would have trapped her on earth forever, Oran got her gown <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of desperation to stop Sindo (in Sino's body) from being killed by Sino (in Sindo's body).|$|R
6000|$|The {{ground is}} measured, all is arranged. Cleveland, a splendid shot, fired first. He grazed Vivian's elbow. Vivian {{fired in the}} air. The seconds interfered. Cleveland was implacable, and, [...] "in the most {{irregular}} manner," [...] as Sir John declared, insisted upon another shot. To the astonishment of all, he fired quite wild. Vivian shot at random, and his bullet pierced Cleveland's heart. Cleveland sprang nearly two yards {{from the ground and}} then fell upon his <b>back.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> Vivian was at the side of his fallen antagonist, but the dying man [...] "made no sign;" [...] he stared wildly, and then closed his eyes for ever! ...|$|R
60|$|Elsie drew <b>back,</b> all abashed. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{her cheek}} grew still redder, I felt sure, than my own.|$|R
6000|$|The {{individual}} {{whose name}} was mention'd, made his excuses to the others, telling them he would be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and left the room. As he {{shut the door behind}} him, and stepp'd into the open air, he saw one of his brothers--his elder by eight or ten years--pacing to and fro with rapid and uneven steps. As the man turn'd in his walk, and the glare of the street lamp fell upon his face, the youth, half-benumb'd as his senses were, was somewhat startled at its paleness and evident perturbation. [...] "Come with me!" [...] said the elder brother, hurriedly, [...] "the illness of our little Jane is worse, and I have been sent for you." ...|$|R
