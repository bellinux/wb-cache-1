50|$|Pitt Meadows {{is located}} in the Lower Fraser Valley, east of Vancouver. Most {{residents}} live in the urban town centre, which islocated on a highland area. Eighty-two percent of Pitt Meadows is within the Green Zone, lands, including watersheds and200 year floodplains, forests, wilderness areas, wildlife habitats, wetlands, recreational areas, farms and forestry areas that fundamental to Metro Vancouver’s character and ecology. Pitt Meadows, an agricultural town, is over 68% within a flood plain with eighty-six percent of Pitt Meadows lying within the BC Agricultural Land Reserve as protected farmland. Lands designated as environmentally sensitive include wildlife conservation areas, such as Pitt-Addington Marsh and Codd Wetland Ecological Conservancy Area and the banks of the Fraser, Pitt and Alouette Rivers. Other areas within Pitt Meadows that are within the Green Zone include: most of the area on the river side of the dikes; Municipal parks and greenways.Pitt Meadows is sandwiched {{on the north side of}} the Fraser River at its junction with the Pitt River on the west and Maple Ridge on the east. Two arms of the Alouette River run through Pitt Meadows, along with a number of other sloughs and waterways. To the north, Pitt Lake is the largest fresh water tidal lake in the world, connected by the Pitt River to the Fraser River, which is the southern boundary of Pitt Meadows. The Pitt River flows backwards at high tide and has created a delta where it joins the lake. The Thompson Mountain Range rises along the Pitt Meadows’s northeast edge. Pitt Meadows is protected from flooding by Sixty-four kilometres of dikes which provide a multi-use trail system alongside the farmland and marshes, and offer views of the mountains to the North. The northern sector of the flood plain, closest to Pitt Lake, presents several challenges to development, it is largely a peat bog including a large wildlife refuge. The deep peat and <b>bog</b> <b>soil</b> conditions sometimes require considerable fill and/or pre-loading prior to development. On the west side of the Pitt River is Port Coquitlam. Pitt Meadows is located between the rapidly developing communities of Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Maple Ridge, Surrey and Langley.|$|E

40|$|Functional {{responses}} of two closely related Dubautia species from {{a mosaic of}} Hawaiian bogs and wet forest were compared to help explain their differential distributions. Dubautia paleata is largely restricted to saturated bogs, while D. raillardioides is restricted to the surrounding, better-drained wet forest. Minimum diurnal tissue water potentials of D. paleata are significantly {{lower than those of}} D. raillardioides, despite the moister condition of <b>bog</b> <b>soil.</b> The tissue osmotic potential at full hydration of D. paleata is significantly lower than that of D. raillardioides. As a result, the tissue water potential at which turgor reaches zero for D. paleata is significantly lower than that of D. raillardioides. Dubautia paleata is thus able to maintain positive turgor to lower water potentials than D. raillardioides. Lack of a lowered, in D. raillardioides may therefore contribute to exclusion of that species from the bog habitat. Preliminary data suggest a significantly greater hydraulic resistance for D. paleata than for D. raillardioides, probably due to higher root resistance caused by the reduced condition of the waterlogged bog substrate. The difference in hydraulic resistance could help account for the contrasting water deficits of the two species...|$|E

However, thus far {{only a limited number}} of laccase or laccase -like enzymes identified through metagenomics has been subsequently biochemically characterized. This work describes the successful bio-mining of bacterial laccase-like enzymes in an acidic <b>bog</b> <b>soil</b> metagenome and the characterization of the first acidobacterial laccase-like multicopper oxidase (LMCO). LMCOs have hitherto been mostly studied in fungi and some have already found applications in diverse industries. However, improved LMCOs are in high demand. Using molecular screening of a small metagenomic library (13, 500 clones), a gene encoding a three-domain LMCO (LacM) was detected, showing the highest similarity to putative copper oxidases of Candidatus Solibacter (Acidobacteria). The encoded protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified by affinity chromatography and biochemically characterized. LacM oxidized a variety of phenolic substrates, including two standard laccase substrates (2, 2 â 8 ̆ 0 ²-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid) (ABTS), kcat/kMÂ =Â  8. 45 Â sâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 21 Â mMâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 21; 2, 6 -dimethoxyphenol (2, 6 -DMP), kcat/kMÂ =Â  6. 42 Â sâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 21 Â mMâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 21), next to L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), vanillic acid, syringaldazine, pyrogallol, and pyrocatechol.

Both soybean and paddy field were reclaimed from wetland. We observed that reclamation significantly reduced SOC content in 0 - 10, 10 - 20 and 20 - 30 cm soil layers in meadow albic soil and meadow marsh soil, and 0 - 10, 10 - 20, 20 - 30 and 30 - 40 cm soil layers in peat <b>bog</b> <b>soil,</b> {{there were no significant}} difference in SOC contents in soil layers under 0 - 30 or 0 - 40 cm before and after reclamation. After reclamation, SOC density in three types of wetland soils decreased, and SOC density in soybean field were higher than that in paddy field. Either in wetlands or farm lands in the three types of wetland soils, most of the SOC storage in 0 - 100 cm soil layer was stored in 0 - 50 cm soil layer. Though wetland reclamation reduced the SOC content, it hasn’t changed the regularity of SOC vertical distribution. The relationships between SOC content and soil depth in wetlands and farm lands all could be described by exponential functions in three types of soils. The specific functions are useful to estimate and predict the regional SOC pool by models...|$|E

We compare the uptake kinetics for NH 4 –N and different fractions of DOM during soil and salmon leachate additions by evaluating the uptake of organic forms of carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON), and proteinaceous DOM, as measured by parallel factor (PARAFAC) modeling of DOM fluorescence. Seasonal DOM slug additions were conducted in three headwater streams draining a bog, forested wetland, and upland forest using DOM collected by leaching watershed soils. We also used DOM collected from <b>bog</b> <b>soil</b> and salmon carcasses to perform additions in the upland forest stream. DOC uptake velocity ranged from 0. 010 to 0. 063 mm s- 1 and DON uptake velocity ranged from 0. 015 to 0. 086 mm s- 1, which provides evidence for the whole-stream uptake of allochtho-nous DOM. These findings imply that wetlands could potentially be an important source of DOM to support stream heterotrophic production. There {{was no significant difference in}} the uptake of DOC and DON across the soil leachate additions (P> 0. 05), although differential uptake of DOM fractions was observed as protein-like fluorescence was removed from the water column more efficiently than bulk DOC and DON (P < 0. 05). Moreover, PARAFAC analysis of DOM fluorescence showed that protein-like fluorescence decreased downstream during all DOM additions, whereas humic-like fluorescence did not change. This differential processing in added DOM suggests slow and fast turnover pools exist for aquatic DOM. Taken together, our findings argue that DON could potentially fill a larger role in satis-fying biotic N demand in oligotrophic headwater streams than previously thought...|$|E

The Sanjiang Plain is an important grain production base in China, and {{it is characterised by}} serious land use change caused by large-scale agricultural exploitation. Agricultural inputs and tillage management have destroyed the soil nutrient balance formed over long-term conditions. There are few studies on non-point source phosphorus pollution in the Sanjiang Plain, which is the largest swampy low plain in a mid-high-latitude region in China. Most studies have focused on the water quality of rivers in marsh areas, or the export mechanism of phosphorus from specific land uses. They were conducted using experimental methods or empirical models, and need further development towards mechanism models and the macro-scale. The question is how {{to find a way to}} couple processes in phosphorus cycling and a distributed hydrological model considering local hydrological features. In this study, we report an attempt to use a distributed phosphorus transport model to analyse non-point source total phosphorus pollution from different land uses and soil types on the Sanjiang Plain. The total phosphorus concentration generally shows an annually increasing trend in the study area. The total phosphorus load intensity is heterogeneous in different land use types and different soil types. The average total phosphorus load intensity of different land use types can be ranked in descending order from paddy field, dry land, wetlands, grassland, and forestland. The average total phosphorus load intensity of different soil types can be ranked in descending order: paddy soil, <b>bog</b> <b>soil,</b> planosol, meadow soil, black soil, and dark brown earth. The dry land and paddy fields account for the majority of total phosphorus load in the study area. This is mainly caused by extensive use of phosphate fertilizer on the cultivated land.

40|$|Two {{methods to}} {{quantify}} the specific Cs sorption capacity of soils and sediments, which is generally believed {{to be associated with}} the Frayed Edge Sites (FES) of illitic clay minerals, are described in detail and are critically reviewed. The first method is a direct measurement of the FES capacity, while the second quantifies the combined parameter, i. e. the product of the FES capacity and the affinity of these sites for Cs. Both methods use the bulky AgTU-complex to mask non-specific sorption sites for Cs and are applied to a number of different soils and pure minerals. Measurement of the FES capacity of pure illite is straightforward. It is shown that the measured capacity is independent of the saturating ion, but does depend on particle size. This method could not be successfully applied to a peat <b>bog</b> <b>soil</b> with 90 % organic matter, because the necessary correction for non-specific Cs sorption by the large pool of organic exchange sites overpasses the capacity of the small FES fraction. Measurement of the combined parameter is shown to be more appropriate in such cases. Application of the FES capacity method to the hydrous aluminosilicate mineral allophane, an important soil constituent of Andisols, shows that the AgTU-complex is unable to block all non-specific sorption sites for Cs on this mineral. The measurements show evidence of a very small number of specific Cs sorption sites on allophane, much smaller than inferred from the FES capacity measurement. The FES capacity of the clay mineral vermiculite is difficult to quantify because the high Cs concentrations that are needed to measure the FES capacity probably cause a collapse of the vermiculite interlayers, thereby creating more high-affinity sites for Cs. The method, in which only trace concentrations of Cs are used, is shown to be more appropriate for soils containing substantial amounts of vermiculite. It is concluded that both the direct FES capacity measurement and the measurement of the combined parameter can be very useful methods to isolate and characterise Cs-selective sorption sites in soils and sediments, but that results should be interpreted with great car...|$|E

Morphometric investigations revealed discrepancies between the measurements of this nematode species and those recorded in nematological literature for H. similis. Personal communications with R. P.

Life history investigations were conducted {{to determine the number}} of days required to complete a life cycle and the various stages as the nematode developed from egg to egg. Eggs mature to first-stage larvae, without sheath or spear, in 3 - 5 days and hatch as second-stage larvae in 8 - 10 days. Second-stage larvae inoculated onto carrot seedlings matured into third-stage larvae in 12 - 15 days. Fourth-stage larvae appeared in 25 - 28 days, and adults were present in 35 - 38 days. Embryonating eggs were observed lodged within an incompletely shed fourth-stage cuticle attached to adult females and within the normal sheath surrounding the adult. One molting specimen was found with two eggs lodged within the fourth-stage cuticle. Such eggs were seen to develop to second-stage larvae; however, none were observed over a long enough time period to determine if larvae hatched and emerged free of the cuticular confinement. Evaluated as hosts were beet, broccoli, carrot, corn, dill, pea, radish, rutabaga, tomato and turnip. Carrot, tomato and turnip supported the highest increase in population; no substantial increase was observed on beet, broccoli, corn and dill. The nematode formed galls consisting of large multibranched growths and reproduced on many of the plant species tested. Galling of seedling roots was most severe on carrot, but slight galling was observed on beet, rutabaga and turnip. Multibranching was observed with varying severity in all hosts. Germination of carrot seeds was reduced substantially when grown in sandy soil infested with H. similis. Slight germination reductions occurred with all hosts tested except corn and pea. Adults and larvae were observed feeding behind root tips and on nematode induced galls. Root discoloration was noted on several plants. To evaluate temperature and soil optima, rooted cranberry cuttings, germinated cranberry seedlings and carrot seedlings were utilized. Carrot seeds were planted in sandy soils of two different textures and pH, infested with H. similis and grown in three temperature regimes: 30 °C and 24 °C night, 22 °C day and 14 °C night and 30 °C day 6 °C night. The optimum temperature for reproduction on carrot was 22 °C day 14 °C night in both soil types. A pH gradient developed in cups with the least acidic pH occurring at the base corresponding to maximum nutrient uptake by plant roots. The soil mix in which bog sand from Bandon was incorporated developed a more acidic condition presumably due to the additional organic N content which supplied ammonical nitrogen. The soil mix with Newport sand had no additional organic N and a less acidic condition developed. Maximum nematode population and root density also occurred {{at the base of the}} cup. Plants grown in infested soil had sparse multibranched roots; no galls were observed in this experiment. Cranberry cuttings were grown in sterile <b>bog</b> <b>soil</b> from Bandon, Oregon and inoculated with 225 nematodes/ 450 cc soil. The optimum temperature for nematode reproduction and plant growth was 30 °C and 24 °C night. Runner growth and root dry weights were not significantly effected by nematode feeding. Germinated cranberry seedlings were subjected to similar conditions; temperature response was similar to that of cuttings. Root dry weights and runner growth of cranberry seedlings was greater in nematode inoculated treatments than non-inoculated controls: nematode feeding on cranberry roots resulted in an increase of multibranching. This research indicated nematode feeding was detrimental to growth of a variety of plant species. High soil populations of H. similis caused severe reductions to root growth and seed germination. However, since this study was conducted in controlled conditions, it was not substantiated that this nematode caused a reduction of growth to field-grown cranberry plants. Further investigations are needed to correlate these findings with field data to determine pathogenicity on cranberry...|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} {{is given}} on soil erosion {{problems in the}} Netherlands. Soil erosion by water and wind occurs in The Netherlands. However, soil erosion {{is not a problem}} on a national scale. The total surface area of The Netherlands is 41 500 km 2, of which 23 500 km 2 30 was agricultural land in 1996. Soil erosion by water only occurs on 40 000 ha of loess soils in the region of South-Limbourg, which has a hilly topography. Wind erosion is more widespread than water erosion. Eppink (1982) mentions that wind erosion occurs on 97 000 ha of agricultural land in The Netherlands, of which 75 000 ha is seriously affected. Wind erosion is an active process in The Netherlands (Knottnerus, 1979; Eppink, 1982; Eppink and Spaan, 1989). It occurs on (a) the beaches and coastal dunes along 250 km of sandy North Sea coast, (b) part of the sandy arable soils behind the coastal dunes, (c) arable cut-over raised peat <b>bog</b> <b>soils</b> with a sandy subsoil in the provinces of Groningen and Drente in the north-eastern part of the country, (d) sandy arable soils in the NetherlandsJRC.

50|$|The area {{currently}} {{classified as}} taiga in Europe and North America (except Alaska) was recently glaciated. As the glaciers receded they left depressions in the topography that have since filled with water, creating lakes and <b>bogs</b> (especially muskeg <b>soil)</b> {{found throughout the}} taiga. In Sweden the taiga {{is associated with the}} Norrland terrain.|$|R
50|$|Landscape {{types and}} {{habitats}} {{on the islands}} include many kinds of beach and rocky shores, cliffs, wide rivers and fast gravelly streams, forests, grasslands, alpine tundra, crater lakes and peat <b>bogs.</b> The <b>soils</b> are generally productive, owing to the periodic influxes of volcanic ash and, in certain places, owing to significant enrichment by seabird guano. However, many of the steep, unconsolidated slopes are susceptible to landslides and newer volcanic activity can entirely denude a landscape. Only the southernmost island has large areas covered by trees, while more northerly islands have no trees, or spotty tree cover.|$|R

5000|$|Vegetation is an {{assemblage}} of plant species and the ground cover they provide. [...] It is a general term, without specific reference to particular taxa, life forms, structure, spatial extent, or any other specific botanical or geographic characteristics. It is broader than the term flora which refers to species composition. Perhaps the closest synonym is plant community, but vegetation can, and often does, refer to {{a wider range of}} spatial scales than that term does, including scales as large as the global. Primeval redwood forests, coastal mangrove stands, sphagnum <b>bogs,</b> desert <b>soil</b> crusts, roadside weed patches, wheat fields, cultivated gardens and lawns; all are encompassed by the term vegetation.|$|R
