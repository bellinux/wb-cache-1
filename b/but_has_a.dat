5|$|First {{described}} by Claude Casimir Gillet, the species retains the name {{which it was}} first given, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> number of taxonomic synonyms. Its specific name honours Louis-Luc Godey. Within the genus Inocybe, it has been classified {{in a number of}} ways, but appears to form part of a clade (that is, a group sharing a common ancestor) with species including I.abietis, I.corydalina, I.agglutinata and I.pudica.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} for the clot to break off and migrate (embolise) to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. An analysis of earlier case reports concludes that this occurs in about 10% of cases, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> very poor prognosis.|$|E

5|$|The {{discoveries of}} the high-radii planets HAT-P-33b and HAT-P-32b, {{along with that}} of WASP-17b, contributed to the {{question}} of what factors, besides temperature, contribute to the large radii of these inflated planets. The discrepancy lies in planet WASP-18b, which is far hotter than the newly discovered HAT planets and WASP-17b, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> far smaller radius.|$|E
5|$|The form peragrus {{is known}} from further south in Mexico, in the Río Verde basin of San Luis Potosi, {{the state of}} Hidalgo, and far {{northern}} Veracruz. Late Pleistocene fossils of this form {{have been found in}} Cueva de Abre, Tamaulipas. According to Goldman, it is intermediate in color between O.c.aquaticus and O.c.couesi, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> skull similar to that of aquaticus.|$|E
5|$|The related Turbinellus kauffmanii, {{found in}} western North America, is similar-looking <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> pale brown cap.

5|$|Built in 1815, Union Street was at {{the heart}} of Plymouth's {{historical}} culture. It became known as the servicemen's playground, as it was where sailors from the Royal Navy would seek entertainment of all kinds. During the 1930s, there were 30 pubs and it attracted such performers as Charlie Chaplin to the New Palace Theatre. It is now the late-night hub of Plymouth's entertainment strip, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> reputation for trouble at closing hours.|$|E
5|$|Characters can equip weapons, armor, rings, and amulets, {{which provide}} attack or defense points, or give bonuses {{to some other}} statistic. There are also usable items such as potions to restore a character's health or mana. Weapons, armor, and other items are found by killing enemies, {{breaking}} containers, or by purchase from vendors. Each character has an inventory, represented as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, the mule, cannot use weapons or magic, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> much larger inventory.|$|E

5|$|Charles Smithson – {{the main}} male character. Though {{born into a}} family {{with close ties to}} nobility, Smithson does not possess a title <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> sizable income and {{considerable}} education. Early in the novel he is described both as a casual naturalist and a Darwinist. Though trying to become an enlightened and forward-thinking individual, the narrator often emphasises, through commentary on Smithson's actions and situation, that his identity is strongly rooted in the traditional social system. Moreover, conflicting identification with social forces, such as science and religion, lead Smithson to an existential crisis.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus rubroflammeus from similar boletes include the deep purple-red cap and the reticulated stem. B.flammans {{is similar in}} appearance, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> more variable cap color, ranging from dark red to brick-red or reddish-brown, a yellow stem base and less prominently reticulate stem, and it grows under conifers. Rubroboletus rhodosanguineus is also very similar but has more variable cap color with brown to olive tones and its cut flesh has an odor of overripe fruit that intensifies when dry. The European species R.rhodoxanthus has a paler overall color. Another European species, B.permagnificus, has larger spores (13–16 by 5–6.5μm), weakly decurrent pores, and only associates with oak trees.|$|E
5|$|Febuxostat is {{typically}} only recommended {{in those who}} cannot tolerate allopurinol. Probenecid appears to be less effective than allopurinol and is a second line agent. Probenecid may be used if undersecretion of uric acid is present (24-hour urine uric acid less than 800mg). It is, however, not recommended if a person {{has a history of}} kidney stones. Pegloticase is an option for the 3% of people who are intolerant to other medications. It is a third line agent. Pegloticase is administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks, and reduces uric acid levels. Pegloticase is useful decreasing tophi <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> high rate of side effects and many people develop resistance to it. In 2016 it was withdrawn from the European market.|$|E
