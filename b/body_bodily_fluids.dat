40|$|Biomaterials are {{required}} to act harmoniously when exposed to the <b>body</b> or <b>bodily</b> <b>fluids.</b> Investigating cellular or in vivo phenotypic responses and protein adsorption to the material surface helps to determine the associated biocompatibility. Past limitations on progress in this field include time-consuming cell-based screening tools and a limited understanding of the complex nature of cell–biomaterial interactions. While high-throughput technologies by their nature are a rapid tool to derive meaning from multifaceted systems and, in recent years, the biomaterial community is beginning {{to take advantage of}} these technologies, the key observation in this Leading Opinion Paper is that the biomaterials community has been slow to accept these methods as an addition to their traditional experimentation workflow. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review the definition and recent usage of high-throughput experiments in order to examine biomaterial interactions at the cellular and wider host level, especially as they become more relevant within the biomaterials arena encapsulating tissue engineering, gene, drug and stem cell delivery systems. The technologies under focus include rapid cell-based screening, transcriptomics and proteomics...|$|R
40|$|Long {{duration}} spaceflight (i. e., 22 days or longer) {{has been}} associated with changes in sensorimotor systems, resulting in difficulties that astronauts experience with posture control, locomotion, and manual control. The microgravity environment is an important causal factor for spaceflight induced sensorimotor changes. Whether these sensorimotor changes may be related to structural and functional brain changes is yet unknown. However, increased intracranial pressure that by itself has been related to microgravity-induced <b>bodily</b> <b>fluid</b> shifts: [1] {{has been associated}} with white matter microstructural damage, [2] Thus, it is possible that spaceflight may affect brain structure and thereby cognitive functioning. Long duration head-down tilt bed rest has been suggested as an exclusionary analog to study microgravity effects on the sensorimotor system, [3] Bed rest mimics microgravity in <b>body</b> unloading and <b>bodily</b> <b>fluid</b> shifts.

40|$|The present MA thesis {{analyzes}} how {{body and}} blood functions as historical and narrative elements in Yu Hua's novel Chronicle of a Blood Merchant (1995). In the novel, the story and the plot can not be regarded as disparate items; the two levels of the text are tightly interwoven by what the thesis introduces as a sangvinolent narration. The term conceptualizes the use of blood as a structural element and {{the thrust of the}} text, in this case how the ability to sell blood is a prerequisite for the story and the plot. Close readings reveal the structural correlations between the blood-selling main-character Xu Sanguan in the plot on the one hand, and in the story on the other, which can be detected to have, inter alia, an effect on the temporality of the narrative. Themes linked to identity, belonging and survival (performativity, mimicry, reification and alienation) permeate the text. In the novel the <b>body</b> and <b>bodily</b> <b>fluids</b> are sacrificed in order to form and enforce perceptions of identity and societal roles. The rhetorical use of ‘blood and tears’ (Ch. xue yu lei) indicates thematic connections to the Chinese revolutionary literature, and furthermore, the use of flesh and blood can be read in relation to the cannibalistic discourses crucial to Chinese modernity since Lu Xun...|$|R
40|$|Though India has {{the state}} of art medical {{facilities}} on par with global standards for a comparatively cheaper cost with best knowledge, the bio-waste management protocols of many hospitals are far below the international standards. An {{effort was made to}} understand the bio-waste management procedures of big hospitals by making a critical analysis of bio waste generated. Biomedical waste includes syringes, live vaccines, laboratory samples, <b>body</b> parts, <b>bodily</b> <b>fluids</b> and waste, sharp needles, cultures and lancets. Based on the parameters of number of beds occupied and number of operations performed on any single day of the observation period of 30 days and comparing with the International Standards mentioned by World Health Organization, an analysis was made to understand whether the hospitals are following the quality parameters implemented by them. After 30 days of evaluation of biomedical waste management protocol at B. L Kapur hospital, New Delhi, it is found that the amount of hazardous bio-medical waste generated/bed/day exceeds the limit as per the international standards. For this study, the labeling component of the protocol for waste management for various departments was documented, to understand the protocol adopted. Through analysis it is concluded that to avoid hazardous effects, all major hospitals should seriously train their staff about the perilous effects of bio-waste and segregating and labeling them properly for disposal by launching a waste management protocol. It is also suggested that by recording the amount of general waste as well as bio-waste generated and conducting periodical surveillance of health care waste management practices, the hospitals can help the hospitals in protecting the environment. As it is an area of much concern, further studies can also be made to understand the impact of such negligible way of handling bio-medical wastes and the impact of such acts on the community...|$|R
