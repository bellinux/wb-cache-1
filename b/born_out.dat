5|$|During her tour to Europe, Eva Perón was {{featured}} in a cover story for Time magazine.

This was the only time in the periodical's history that a South American first lady appeared alone on its cover. (In 1951, Eva appeared again with Juan Perón.) However, the 1947 cover story was also the first publication to mention that Eva had been <b>born</b> <b>out</b> of wedlock.

5|$|It is {{also from}} the Neolithic, in about 3000 BC, that we glimpse the first known {{illustrations}} of plants and read descriptions of impressive gardens in Egypt. However protobotany, the first pre-scientific written record of plants, did not begin with food; it was <b>born</b> <b>out</b> of the medicinal literature of Egypt, China, Mesopotamia and India. Botanical historian Alan Morton notes that agriculture was the occupation {{of the poor and}} uneducated, while medicine was the realm of socially influential shamans, priests, apothecaries, magicians and physicians, who were more likely to record their knowledge for posterity.|$|E

5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter was <b>born</b> <b>out</b> of her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story {{and moved on to}} another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E

5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was <b>born</b> <b>out</b> of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Ranjang Pande, the {{youngest}} son of Damodar Pande, was stationed as a {{captain in the}} army in Kathmandu. He {{was aware of the}} disunity between Samrajya Laxmi and Bhimsen; and thus he had secretly expressed his loyalty to Samrajya Laxmi and had vowed to help her in bringing Bhimsen down for all the wrongs he had committed against his family. Factions in the Nepalese court had also started to develop around the rivalry between the two queens, with the Senior Queen supporting the Pandes, while the Junior Queen supporting the Thapas. About a month after Mathabar's return to Kathmandu, a child was <b>born</b> <b>out</b> of an adulterous relationship between him and his widowed sister-in-law. This news was spread all over the country by the Pandes, and the resulting public disgrace forced Mathabar to leave Kathmandu and reside in his ancestral home in Pipal Thok, Borlang, Gorkha. To save face, Bhimsen gave Mathabar the governorship of Gorkha.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{was delighted}} with his team's win and {{credited}} his opponent's performance. He felt the brawl in stoppage time was <b>born</b> <b>out</b> of Arsenal's frustration after going {{behind in the}} match; {{he did not want}} either team to be punished. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger apologised for his players' conduct and said he had no regrets over his team selection. Both finalists were fined £100,000 each by The Football Association for their inability to control their players. Emmanuel Eboué was retrospectively banned for three matches as his punch on Wayne Bridge was missed by Howard Webb. Wenger was later found guilty of improper conduct and charged £2,500 for his comments about the linesman.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{clinical}} presentation, investigational profile and outcome of neonatal sepsis {{in general and}} with special reference to inborn (intramural) or <b>out</b> <b>born</b> (extramural), sex and weight of the neonate. Materials and method: Retrospective descriptive study of neonates admitted during 2 years from July 2007 to June 2009 in special care neonatal unit {{of the department of}} Pediatrics, College of Medical Sciences-Teaching Hospital, Bharatpur, Nepal. Results: Majority of neonates were <b>out</b> <b>born</b> and referred (72. 2 %) to this institution. Significant number of babies was having sepsis in <b>out</b> <b>born</b> group (59 %) as compared to inborn (35 %). Male sex was found to have more sepsis as compared to female. Sepsis was observed to be inversely related to birth weight, 65 % in low birth weight (LBW, 2. 5 kg). Conclusions: High index of suspicion for diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is required specially in the presence of risk factors. Prevalence of sepsis is inversely related to birth weight. More number of <b>out</b> <b>born</b> delivered babies developed sepsis. Neonatal sepsis related morbidity and mortality can be significantly reduced by comprehensive obstetric and neonatal care at multiple levels right from community to health institutions...|$|R
