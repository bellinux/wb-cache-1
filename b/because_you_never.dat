It's {{got a lot of}} {{ingredients}} to it because I never thought that Mariah could make a bouncy type of record. When you hear that song — the whole bounce of the record and the way she's flipping it and the stuff she talking about ... I knew that record was gonna go just <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> heard Mariah talk about this stuff. ... She's like, 'I packed up my Louis Vuitton.' She took it really on the ghetto side. I knew that was gonna strike people. Either it was gonna hit them in a wrong way or they was gonna love it.|$|E

Smith embarked on a promotional tour, beginning {{at the end of}} October, with magazine, television and radio appearances. Appearances included Ready Steady Cook, Blue Peter, the BBC News Channel, Sky News Sunrise, The Alan Titchmarsh Show and The Paul O'Grady Show. Speaking about the album's promotion, Smith said [...] "t is always a struggle when a second album comes out <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> know how it is going to do but fingers crossed people will enjoy it. I am very proud of it. ... I am excited about going on all the shows too – especially Ready Steady Cook because I can't cook and I think it will be fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the show}} not yet being officially renewed {{for a fourth}} season, Fringe began casting in mid-March for a [...] "green FBI agent... to come aboard for the finale and {{possibly}} recur next year", as reported by E! Online. TVLine's Michael Ausiello announced later in the month that actress Emily Meade has been cast for the role, describing her character as [...] "a wide-eyed and eager rookie who’s ready to face all of the challenges in front of her", {{and that she would}} make her first appearance in the finale. In {{the months leading up to}} the finale, Wyman responded to reports the character would be recurring by calling her casting more of a [...] "safety net"; much like Seth Gabel's casting, he did not want to commit himself to her character yet, saying, [...] "We always protect ourselves by saying that <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> know". The actress was later revealed to be playing a grown up version of Olivia's niece, Ella.|$|E

500|$|During Beyoncé's 2009 Las Vegas revue show, I Am... Yours, she {{performed}} the song {{live for the}} first time. Before performing the song, the singer described its meaning depth, stating: [...] "How {{many of you have}} ever been lied to? I'm sure everyone has —we all have. But this next song is from my last album, B'Day. And I never performed this song before, this is especially for Encore It talks about a relationship after you've been lied to. And you're trying your best to forgive. But it's difficult <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> forget. It's called 'Resentment'." [...] She additionally included the song on the 2009 [...] as the ninth track of the DVD/CD's first disc. During a Thanksgiving TV Special, Beyoncé aired I Am... Yours in its entirety which also featured her performance of [...] "Resentment". Nate Chinen of The New York Times said, [...] "There's exactly one human-scale moment in the concert, when she sits at the lip of the stage to sing an acoustic treatment of 'Resentment,' from her album 'B'Day.' And even then she makes it a showstopper." ...|$|E
500|$|Forrest Wickman of Slate {{magazine}} defended Beyoncé's {{choice to}} use the sample, and criticized the media reports for their [...] "dismissive" [...] interpretation of the song's [...] "vague" [...] lyrics as being about [...] "a girl in a relationship". According to Wickman, the lyrics of the song refer to mortality and [...] "the urgency of spending time with the ones you love before you lose them, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> know when that could be"; this {{is shown in the}} hook lines, [...] "Baby kiss me / Before they turn the lights out / You better kiss me / Before our time has run out." [...] A similar interpretation was voiced by Douglas Wolk of Wired, who challenged the notion of the sample being simply a [...] "trivialization", instead describing it as [...] "a swift, understated and brutal reminder that everything can go horribly wrong before anyone understands what's happening, and that the light could be extinguished at any moment". Wickman concluded, [...] "If there's anything anyone should know by now about Beyoncé Knowles, it's that there's nothing in her self-presentation that isn't carefully chosen." ...|$|E

Maybe I’ll decide in a couple years to come back, and this will just be a little break, you never know." [...] The couple has two sons, William David, born in November 2014, and Charles Alexander, born in December 2016.|$|E

2500|$|The January 21 CNN/Congressional Black Caucus {{debate in}} Myrtle Beach {{was the most}} heated {{face-to-face}} meeting yet between the candidates, reflecting apparent personal animosity. Clinton criticized Obama for voting [...] "present" [...] on many occasions while in the Illinois legislature. [...] "It's hard to have a straight up debate with you <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> take responsibility for any vote," [...] she said. Obama explained that Illinois had a different system than Congress and that 'present' votes had a different function and use in the Illinois Senate. Obama {{said that he was}} working to help unemployed workers in Chicago while Clinton was [...] "a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at Wal-Mart." [...] He also took issue with statements made on the campaign trail by Bill Clinton, saying [...] "I can't tell who I'm running against sometimes." [...] The confrontation was the most-watched primary season debate in cable television news history.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, {{frontman}} Josh Homme {{was hospitalized}} for thirteen days, and subsequently bedridden for four months, following complications during a routine surgical procedure on his knee. Homme noted, [...] "I {{woke up and}} there was a doctor going, ‘Shit, we lost you.' I couldn’t get up for four months. When I did, I hadn’t got a clue what was going on." [...] During this time, Homme sank into a deep depression, noting [...] "I would never say, 'I'm probably not gonna make it out of here.' But back then, I would definitely think it." [...] The remaining members of Queens of the Stone Age— guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, drummer Joey Castillo, bassist Michael Shuman and guitarist and keyboardist Dean Fertita – encouraged Homme to return to the band to begin work on a sixth studio album. Homme noted, [...] "I had to ask them 'If {{you want to make a}} record with me right now, in the state I’m in, come into the fog. It's the only chance you got.' It brought us much closer, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> really know someone till everything goes wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Clarkson {{released}} her first Christmas album, Wrapped in Red, which to her represented a beginning {{for a second}} phase for her career. In the midst of recording it, she also collaborated with recording artists Robbie Williams, Martina McBride and Trisha Yearwood in their respective albums Swings Both Ways (2013), Everlasting (2014) and [...] (2014). In an interview with Billboard magazine, she announced intentions to release a set of pop and country records, {{as well as a}} potential Broadway album, as a follow-up to Wrapped in Red. RCA Records chief executive Peter Edge also revealed in their 2014 mid-year assessment that they were in a process of finding new music and directions for some of their established acts — primarily with Clarkson. Early stages of development for a follow-up studio album began as early as June 2012, with Clarkson commissioning Rodney Jerkins in recording a potential track. She remarked: [...] "We're already working. I'm constantly like that <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> know when you're going to find a song and so we're always working on the next thing." [...] The follow-up album would complete the terms of her recording contract with RCA Records and 19 Recordings, which was signed following her win on the first season of the television competition American Idol in 2002.|$|E

2500|$|Arthur {{became one}} of EastEnders best loved characters, and his {{reputation}} as an eternal loser endeared him to viewers. In 1995 audiences were shocked and horrified when Arthur was framed for the embezzlement of the Flowering Wilderness Campaign funds and wrongfully imprisoned. There was a public outcry and a nationwide Free Arthur Fowler campaign was launched. 'Arthur Fowler Is Innocent' T-shirts were produced and a single was even released in the UK singles chart promoting the campaign. [...] Eventually the truth came out and Arthur was released. However, a gash to the head he had sustained in prison led to a brain haemorrhage and Arthur died suddenly in 1996 shortly after his release. Off-screen Bill Treacher had asked to be written out of the series after eleven years playing Arthur, saying: [...] "By the time I finished, even {{the sound of the}} theme music was making me feel ill. I felt depressed." [...] Although it was his decision to leave the soap, Treacher was shocked that the show’s bosses chose to kill Arthur off. He has said: [...] "I certainly didn’t ask them to kill him. Oh no, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> know, you might need to come back and earn a few grand." [...] Treacher also stated in a 2003 interview that he was forced to resign from the show in the end due to the negative effect it was having on his health.|$|E

50|$|The term {{elicitation}} is used {{in books}} and research to raise the fact that good requirements cannot just be collected from the customer, as would be indicated by the name requirements gathering.
