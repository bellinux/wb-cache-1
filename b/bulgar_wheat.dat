5000|$|Kheer is a pudding, {{usually made}} from milk, sugar {{and one of}} these {{ingredients}} - vermicelli, rice, <b>Bulgar</b> <b>wheat,</b> semolina, tapioca, dried dates, and shredded white gourd. It {{is also known as}} [...] "Payas". While Phirni is a popular variant of kheer.|$|E
50|$|A {{rice cooker}} {{can be used}} to cook many boiled or steamed {{granular}} foods, such as pot barley, <b>bulgar</b> <b>wheat,</b> and dal. Provided the ingredients have similar cooking times, a rice cooker can cook mixtures such as khichdi. Some rice cookers can be used as automated couscoussiers, cooking couscous and a stew simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|The {{favorite}} dish was a layered pie {{stuffed with}} sheep's milk cheese and soaked {{with sour cream}} before baking. Other delicacies were pies with crumbled pumpkin and sweet pies made with the first milk of a cow that had just calved. The traditional ritual dish called kurban combined <b>bulgar</b> <b>wheat</b> porridge with a slaughtered (or sacrificed) ram and is {{further evidence of the}} origins of the Gagauz in both the Balkan world and the steppe-pastoral complex. Peppered meat sauces are especially important: one combines onion and finely granulated porridge, while another is tomato-based. A red house wine is served with dinner and supper. Head cheese is an indispensable component of holiday meals.|$|E
50|$|International {{voluntary}} and charity organisations have assisted. Church World Service has provided milk powder to Delhi and Madras Municipal Corporation; CARE has provided corn soya meal, <b>Bulgar</b> <b>wheat,</b> and vegetable oils; and UNICEF has provided high proteins foods and educational support. In 1982, 'Food for Learning' was launched with {{assistance from the}} Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Initially the programme was aimed at scheduled caste and scheduled tribe girls. In 1983, the federal Department of Education prepared a scheme {{under the auspices of}} the World Food Programme to supply meals to 13.6 million scheduled caste girls and 10.09 million scheduled tribe girls in classes one to five in 15 states and three union territories. The value of the food itself was $163.27 million per year. Labour, facilities, and transportation costs were to be paid by the state governments. The reaction among the states and union territories was mixed. Many states were interested, but some were concerned about their ability to afford it if the FAO support were to be withdrawn.|$|E
40|$|A Phoma species, {{producing}} a squalestatin (Si) was grown on agar media derived from wheat, oats, {{oil seed rape}} and malt extract over a range of water availability values corresponding to water activity (aa) levels of. 0. 998, 0. 995, 0. 990, 0. 980 and 0. 960. Growth of the organism was not significantly affected by aw, except at the lowest value, but production of SI was significantly enhanced at intermediate aW in the range 0. 990 - 0. 980. For example, at 25 °C and 0. 98 aw wheat extract produced a l Ox increase in titre compared to 0. 998 aw at the same temperature. Wheat extract was shown {{to be the best}} substrate for SI production. For example, at 25 °C and 0. 98 aW, this substrate produced 2 x, 5 x and 8 x increases in titres compared to oat, malt and oil seed rape extracts respectively. A range of raw and processed agricultural products, including those used as extracts with the Phoma species, as well as maize, rice, soya, wheat flakes, <b>bulgar</b> <b>wheat,</b> couscous and "shredded wheat", were selected as candidate materials for solid substrate fermentation (SSF). Moisture sorption isotherms were prepared for each of these so that aW could be accurately set in experimental work. Small scale fermentations (40 cm 3 wet substrate volume) were carried out with these materials and the fungi Epicoccum nigrum, Sarophorum palmicola, Drechslera dematioidea and Corynespora cassiicola over the aw range 0. 998 - 0. 970. Studies with E. nigrum in particular produced a range of unique metabolites at low aw, and other metabolites where titres were increased by as much as 20 x compared to high aW conditions. The optimum aw level for metabolite production in this fungus appeared to be in the range 0. 990 - 0. 980. Ultimately, E. nigrum was chosen as the model fungus and <b>bulgar</b> <b>wheat</b> as the model substrate, with 3 key target metabolites being followed (metabolites 1, 2 and 3). A series of scale-up studies (40 cm 3 - 3 litres wet volume) were carried out utilising the model system. These studies typically produced reasonable levels of metabolites, but were subject to problematic water and heat accumulation, and bacterial contamination. These were identified as critical parameters. A system was ultimately developed around a Bioengineering AG submerged liquid fermenter, modified for use with solid substrates, and incorporating forced aeration and mechanical agitation. This apparatus gave encouraging levels of metabolites, producing most of these rapidly and uniformly, and showed good critical parameter control. The overall scale-up achieved in the final fermenter studies was 75 x, in terms of wet substrate volume. Increased titres were achieved for all three target metabolites compared to small-scale studies with the same substrate. These increases were approx. 17 x for metabolite 1, approx. 3 x for metabolite 3, while metabolite 2 was absent from small scale studies at the relevant aW level.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{production}} of high numbers of propagules of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae with high germination capacity under low water availability, good storage stability and enhanced pathogenicity. To this end modifications of cultural conditions were employed. Water-stress in solid substrate fermentation reduced the conidial production but resulted in enhancement of germination capacity. Conidial production and germination was also considerably influenced {{by the type of}} solid substrate (<b>bulgar</b> <b>wheat,</b> millet grain). Intracellular accumulation of endogenous reserves of selected polyols, which have been linked with enhancement of germination under conditions of restricted water availability, was altered by such substrate modifications. Imposed water-stress in liquid culture resulted in increased blastospore production in the 0. 998 to 0. 96 water activity (a.) range when ionic solutes (NaCl, KCI) were used for medium modification but when PEG 200 was used, this range was narrower (0. 998 - 0. 98 aw). Water-stress resulted in the production of modified blastospores with increased levels of the low molecular weight polyol erythritol. Higher amounts of endogenous polyols were retained intracellularly when modified blastospores were harvested in isotonic solutions compared to those subjected to hypo-osmotic shock by washing with water. Intracellular polyol patterns of blastospores were also affected by nitrogen source, pH and aW-modifying solute as well as by interaction between these factors. Optimum conditions for increased erythritol accumulation occurred when ionic solutes (NaCl, KCl) were used for aW modification and in the pH range between 6. 8 - 8. Total endogenous protein was also enhanced under the same conditions. Germination of blastospores produced under these conditions was between 62 - 89 % under conditions of water-stress (0. 96 a,). In contrast, blastospores with lower amounts of erythritol and total protein content had decreased germination (8 - 67 %). Osmoprotection of such modified blastospores resulted in increased storage stability as wet pastes and as freeze-dried preparations. Fluidised bed dried blastospores had either decreased viability ( 40 %) but high conent of moisture (> 30 %). Destruxin A production was not affected by osmoprotection whereas protease activity was enhanced by isotonic washing with PEG 200 solution but not by. ionic (NaCl) or carbohydrate (glucose) solutions. Modified blastospores were not more infective to aphids than unmodified ones under 100 % R. H. regimes...|$|E
