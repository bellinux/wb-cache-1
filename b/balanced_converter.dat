A single-ended and a balanced version were designed. The circuits were implemented in a 0. 35 -μm SiGe BiCMOS process from AMI Semiconductor. From the obtained results, we show that post-processing the FBAR directly over the IC eliminates much of the parasitics and modelling issues associated with bondwires. Furthermore, it reduces the circuit area. The single-ended and balanced oscillators {{are based on the}} Colpitts configuration and achieve respectively a state-of-the-art phase noise performance (at the time of design) of − 117. 7 dBc/Hz and − 121 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset from the 5. 4 -GHz carrier frequency.

40|$|Abstract: In this dissertation, a {{balanced}} buck converter {{was designed and}} implemented into a light emitting diode (LED) driver. Balancing a buck converter allows the mitigation of conducted common mode (CM) electromagnetic interference (EMI). This <b>balanced</b> <b>converter</b> is designed to implement in any device that requires a buck converter. Other methods to reduce EMI that were also investigated show similar results of reducing EMI {{in terms of the}} balancing method but to a lesser extent. The following factors were investigated to reduce the conducted CM EMI for a buck converter:  Layout inductance: The reduction in layout inductance, results in the components in the circuit to be closer to each other, therefore making the physical size of the printed circuit board (PCB) smaller. Reducing the layout inductance reduces CM noise, due to the decrease in coupling capacitance and ringing.  Copper pour size: Decreasing the size of the copper pours in the circuit reduces CM noise. This method has also shown to reduce differential mode (DM) noise but not to the same magnitude as CM noise.  Balancing circuit: Balancing a circuit, in this case a buck converter circuit, in results the most significant reduction in EMI. The balancing method focuses on CM noise reduction because the operation of the balanced buck converter was kept the same as the unbalanced buck converter. This study provides designers with an understanding of the importance of buck converter layout when needing to reduce EMI. It also demonstrates the trade-off between the reductions in EMI versus the physical circuit size of the buck converter. M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering...|$|E

The buck, boost, buck-boost, and flyback topologies {{are used to}} demonstrate that familiar dc converters can be extended into equivalent ac converters. Although {{some of these are}} presented as fast-switching circuits, they have also been found in slow-switching applications. Thus, topology is the unifying factor not only over four fields of power electronics, but also within each field itself. Describing equations are used to characterize low frequency components of the inputs and outputs in fast-switching networks containing filters, excited by dc or balanced sinusoidal sources, and pulse-width-modulated by dc or balanced sinusoidal duty ratios. They are first written in the stationary (abc) reference frame and then transformed to the rotating (ofb) coordinates. In the ofb coordinates, all <b>balanced</b> ac <b>converters</b> with any number of phases are reduced to a set of continuous, time-invariant differential equations describing a two-phase equivalent. Steady-state, dynamic, and canonical models are then solved in the rotating frame of reference. Emphasis is stressed on circuit ideality - sinusoidal outputs for sinusoidal inputs even though a switched network is nonlinear - and effects of filters on steady-state and small-signal frequency responses. These results are similar for a dc converter, inverter, rectifier, and cycloconverter of the same topology; this similarity again confirms that the four converters are closely related.

40|$|Control and {{analysis}} techniques in switched-mode inversion (dc-ac) and rectification (ac-dc) are {{examined in this}} thesis. Current programming and sliding mode control are used to provide regulation and obtain desired dynamic responses. The basic buck, boost, flyback, and buck-boost topologies are used to illustrate the different methods of control {{and analysis}}. For illustration, embodiments employ fast switching converters, but the techniques described {{can be applied to}} any general converter. Different possibilities for the current programming of dc-ac inverters and ac-dc rectifiers are explored and the more practical and advantageous methods noted. Current reference programming improves the dynamic response of the converter and simplifies the design of the main regulatory loop. It also protects the switches from excessive current stresses and enables the parallel operation of many converters to support a common load. Constant frequency current reference programmed converters are, however, subject to oscillations under certain operating conditions. Describing equations are used to obtain the low frequency characterization of current programmed converters. The system representation is first obtained in the stationary abc reference frame and then transformed to the rotating dq coordinate frame. In the dq coordinate system, the low frequency characterizations of all <b>balanced,</b> polyphase ac <b>converter</b> systems are represented by a set of continuous, time-invariant differential equations. The steady-state and linearized, small signal dynamic responses are then obtained in this rotating reference frame. Sliding mode control is applied to inverters and rectifiers to provide regulation and ensure the stability of the system in the presence of small and large signal disturbances. This is a natural method of control for variable structure systems and enables the design of a robust controller that can provide stability and performance in the face of plant uncertainities. However, it requires that all or many of the states of the system be accessible and results in a variable switching frequency in the converter. The equivalent control method is used to obtain the low frequency properties of the sliding mode system, and {{can also be used to}} obtain the low frequency models of duty ratio programmed converters. Different switching strategies can be used to provide sliding mode control, as well as to optimize responses, maximize efficiency, or minimize switching losses.

40|$|Cascaded H-bridge (CHB) {{converters}} {{are today}} considered the industrial standard for STATCOM applications, mainly {{due to their}} small footprint, high achievable voltage levels, modularity and reduced losses. However, there are still areas of research {{that need to be}} investigated in order to improve the performance and the operational range of this converter topology for grid-applications. The aim of this thesis is to explore control and modulation schemes for the CHB-STATCOM, highlighting the advantages but also the challenges and possible pitfalls that this kind of topology presents for this specific application. The first part of the thesis is dedicated to the two main modulation techniques for the CHBSTATCOM: the Phase-Shifted PulseWidthModulation (PS-PWM) and the Level-Shifted PWM (LS-PWM) with cells sorting. In particular, {{the focus is on the}} impact of the adopted modulation technique on the active power distribution on the individual cells of the converter. When using PS-PWM, it is shown that non-ideal cancellation of the switching harmonics leads to a nonuniform active power distribution among the cells and thereby to the need for an additional control loop for individual DC-link voltage balancing. Theoretical analysis proves that a proper selection of the frequency modulation ratio leads to a more even power distribution over time, which in turns alleviates the role of the individual balancing control. Both PS-PWM and cells sorting schemes fail in cell voltage <b>balancing</b> when the <b>converter</b> is not exchanging reactive power with the grid (converter in zero-current mode). To overcome this problem, two methods for individual DC-link voltage balancing at zero-current mode are proposed and verified. Then, the thesis focuses on the operation of the CHB-STATCOM under unbalanced conditions. Two different strategies for DC-link capacitor voltage balancing, based on zero-sequence voltage/ current and negative-sequence current control, are investigated and compared. The comparison shows that none of the investigated control strategies allow for the full utilization of the converter capacity. Aiming at enhancing the converter utilization, two alternative control strategies, based on the proper combination of the zero-sequence and negative-sequence current control, are proposed and investigated. Finally, the operation of the CHB-STATCOM when controlling the voltage at the connection point in case of unbalanced system conditions is considered. It is shown that even if the device is intended for compensation of the positive-sequence voltage only, control of the negativesequence voltage might be necessary in order to avoid undesired overvoltages.

This multilevel converter topology is today considered the industrial standard for STATCOM applications and has replaced other converter topologies, mainly due to its small footprint, high achievable voltage levels (allowing transformer-less operation), modularity and reduced losses. However, there are still areas of research that need to be investigated in order to improve the performance and the operational range of this converter topology for grid-applications. The aim of this thesis is to explore control and modulation schemes for the CHB-STATCOM, both under balanced and unbalanced conditions of the grid, highlighting the advantages but also the challenges and possible pitfalls that this kind of topology presents for this specific application. The first part of the thesis is dedicated to the two main modulation techniques for the CHBSTATCOM: the Phase-Shifted PulseWidthModulation (PS-PWM) and the Level-Shifted PWM (LS-PWM) with cells sorting. In particular, the focus is on the impact of the adopted modulation on the active power distribution on the individual cells of the converter. When using PS-PWM, it is shown that non-ideal cancellation of the switching harmonics leads to a non-uniform active power distribution among the cells and thereby to the need for an additional control loop for individual DC-link voltage balancing. Theoretical analysis proves that a proper selection of the frequency modulation ratio leads to a more even power distribution over time, which in turns alleviates the role of the individual balancing control. Both PS-PWM and cells sorting schemes fail in cell voltage <b>balancing</b> when the <b>converter</b> is not exchanging reactive power with the grid (converter in zero-current mode). To overcome this problem, two methods for individual DC-link voltage balancing at zero-current mode are proposed and verified. Then, the thesis focuses on the operation of the CHB-STATCOM under unbalanced conditions. It is shown analytically that regardless of the configuration utilized for the CHB-STATCOM (star or in delta configuration), a singularity exists when trying to guarantee balancing in the DC-link capacitor voltages. In particular, it is shown that the star configuration is sensitive to the level of unbalance in the current exchanged with the grid, with a singularity in the solution when positive- and negative-sequence currents have the same magnitude. Similar results are found for the delta configuration where, in a pure duality with the star configuration, the system is found to be sensitive to the level of unbalance in the applied voltage. The presence of these singularities represents an important limit of this topology for STATCOM applications...|$|R
