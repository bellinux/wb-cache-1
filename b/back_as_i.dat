500|$|Schuur {{started singing}} {{when she was}} about three years old. Her mother, who died when Schuur was 13, loved jazz and had a Duke Ellington record collection. Her father, a police captain, was an amateur {{musician}} who often played piano with his daughter sitting by his side. Schuur stated, [...] "As far <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can remember, singing was in my blood. My parents loved music, and I loved to sing. I was scatting at an early age". She has absolute pitch memory. Unlike the average person, in Schuur's mind every sound – musical or not – has a note value; for example, if she hears a humming motor, she knows the name that note has on a musical instrument. Schuur listened to the radio avidly in her youth; her early musical idols were Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. She said that as a small child she would often retreat to a closet to sing.|$|E
2500|$|Repeatedly bullied {{by white}} {{children}} in her neighborhood, Parks often fought back physically. She later said that [...] "As far <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> remember, I could never {{think in terms of}} accepting physical abuse without some form of retaliation if possible." ...|$|E
2500|$|As far <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can {{remember}} Father's place was all made and in order. The house {{was large and}} well-built, of Californian redwood, the garden prim and carefully tented. Everything about it was extremely English. It was as though Father had buried a tremendous homesickness in this new soil and it had rooted and sprung up English. There were hawthorn hedges, primrose banks, and cow pastures with shrubberies." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} take her in my arms. She drew <b>back</b> <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> had frightened her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I am {{not going}} to stop here," [...] said the King, [...] "and so <b>I</b> might <b>as</b> well go <b>back</b> <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can." [...] And he shouted to the head man of the line to pass on the order that his edict of {{banishment}} be revoked.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll come <b>back</b> <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can," [...] she promised, with {{a little}} break in her voice,--"as soon <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> can, Mr. Heepman." ...|$|R
2500|$|As {{she came}} from a strong legal background, her family [...] "weren't wildly happy" [...] about her desire to become an actress: [...] "My parents were always making me watch Rumpole of the Bailey, going 'You see? It’s just like acting, you make things up, you wear a wig and a funny outfit. Why not the law?' But I just always, always wanted to act, as far <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> remember." [...] Her joining the Royal Shakespeare Company though, finally won her parents over. However, in a 2004 {{interview}} Oberman noted that her father's death seven years earlier prevented his seeing the development of her career and her national success as an actor: [...] "I've {{come a long way}} in my career since he died and I wish he was here to see it. He was a big EastEnders fan so I know he'd be very, very proud of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elements of {{the album}} dated back {{to the end of}} the songwriting process for the {{previous}} album, Given to the Rising. Scott Kelly explained that the band continued to [...] "overwrite and then start subtracting ...As far <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can remember, there's always been an initial sort of reflection on where we were with the previous record and what we feel like doing, where we feel like we could be better. [...] We sort of let that settle in and then let the music go as it wishes". [...] Von Till explained that the lengthy songwriting process, which took over 5 years, was important to achieving the end result: [...] "For these songs, we had to kind of let them reconstitute themselves or transform into a new shape over time...It's basically finding the opportunities to surrender ourselves to that kind of tangible spirit that drives everything we do".|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{met with}} Victor Huguet (7 August), a French liaison officer summoned to London at Kitchener’s request, {{and sent him}} back to France to obtain more {{information}} from Joffre, having told him of British plans to start movement of troops on 9 August. Kitchener, angry that Wilson had acted without consulting him, summoned him to his office for a rebuke. Wilson was angry that Kitchener was confusing the mobilisation plans by deploying troops from Aldershot to Grimsby in case of German invasion, and recorded in his diary that [...] "I answered <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{have no intention of}} being bullied by him especially when he talks such nonsense … the man is a fool … He is a d---- fool". On Huguet's return (12 August) he met with French, Murray and Wilson. They agreed to deploy the BEF to Maubeuge, but Kitchener, in a three-hour meeting which was, according to Wilson, [...] "memorable in showing K’s colossal ignorance and conceit", tried to insist on a deployment to Amiens where the BEF would be in less danger of being overrun by the Germans coming north of the Meuse. Wilson wrote not just of the difficulties and delays which Kitchener was making but also of “the cowardice of it”, but {{there is little doubt that}} Kitchener was correct. The clash of personalities between Wilson and Kitchener worsened relations between Kitchener and Sir John French, who often took Wilson's advice.|$|E
60|$|And then <b>I</b> came <b>back</b> <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> came <b>back</b> to a refrain;--the ideas go on--as {{though we}} are all no more than little cells and corpuscles in some great brain beyond our understanding....|$|R
2500|$|On July 7, 2016, Duran Duran {{announced}} that MNDR {{would stand in}} for Nick Rhodes during part of the third leg of the Paper Gods tour in the United States. Rhodes was quoted as saying, [...] "I will be <b>back</b> <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can but know, in the meantime, that I am leaving both the band and fans in great hands, with the fabulous MNDR." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it {{what do they}} mane?" [...] {{answered}} Mike. [...] "Well, there's but one maning to powther and ball, and that's {{far more}} sarious than shillelah wor-r- k. If the rapscallions didn't fire a whole plathoon, as serjeant Joyce calls it, right at the Knoll, my name is not Michael O'Hearn, or my nature one that dales in giving <b>back</b> <b>as</b> good <b>as</b> <b>I</b> get." ...|$|R
60|$|Involuntarily I {{pushed my}} chair <b>back,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> looked from the boards {{at which he}} pointed to himself.|$|E
60|$|But {{he had no}} idea {{of drawing}} <b>back,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> should have known had I been acquainted with him longer.|$|E
60|$|Through sheer thoughtlessness, I {{did a very}} foolish thing. I turned <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was told, {{and left}} the {{brothers}} together at {{the gate of the}} stable-yard.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will accept}} the loan gladly, Mrs. Price. I don't like to go around without a cent. I will pay you <b>back</b> <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, that I can't, Nannie; I promised Dobbs {{to go and}} see a man for him, and <b>I</b> {{must come}} <b>back</b> <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can after that.' ...|$|R
5000|$|On July 7, 2016, Duran Duran {{announced}} that MNDR {{would stand in}} for founding keyboardist Nick Rhodes during part of the third leg of the Paper Gods tour in the United States.

6000|$|... "From time to time, I looked <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> went on. There he was, {{always at}} the same distance, dim and ghost-like in the dusk, silently {{following}} me.|$|E
60|$|He {{heard me}} through, giving <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> came forward, his face {{blanching}} only a little, and wearing {{all the time}} that yellow smile which so fitted it.|$|E
60|$|I {{thought it}} best to go <b>back.</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> drew nearer to them, trying to propitiate the tinker by my looks, I {{observed}} that the woman had a black eye.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'll {{take three}} of the deer with me and come <b>back</b> <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can. One deer will be all you will need," [...] {{answered}} Sid Todd.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hollo, Ralph!" [...] cried my companion, seizing me {{with one}} hand by the collar, and hauling, or rather lifting me <b>back,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> had been a poodle dog. [...] "Why, you were as near as {{possible}} into a pitfall." ...|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. (Aside.) And {{some people}} would like women to assist in making the laws. Introduction to imply condonement. (Aloud.) Well, you see, if you can {{remember}} so far <b>back</b> <b>as</b> that, <b>I</b> couldn't, in common politeness, refuse the offer.|$|R
60|$|Then {{our guide}} lifted her hand slowly {{and pointed to}} the fire. At once the man turned ghastly white, groaned and fell <b>back,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> think, quite dead, slain by his own terror.|$|E
6000|$|I looked <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{crossed the}} field. The driver {{was sitting on}} the gate, smoking his pipe, and the horse was {{nibbling}} the grass at the roadside. Two happy animals, without a burden on their minds! ...|$|E
6000|$|I thrust it hurriedly into my pocket, and ran <b>back.</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> {{passed through}} the gateway I asked a peon to send Enriquez to me. The man stared. Did I not know that Don Enriquez had ridden away two minutes ago? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hi, there! Mrs. Moss! Something has {{happened}} to Miss Celia, and I'm going to find her. Thorny is asleep; tell him easy, and I'll come <b>back</b> <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can!" ...|$|R

60|$|Looking <b>back,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was saying, {{into the}} blank of my infancy, the first objects I can {{remember}} as standing out by themselves from a confusion of things, are {{my mother and}} Peggotty. What else do I remember? Let me see.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] I answered, [...] "whatever happens I shall {{remember}} your words, {{which are more}} to me than any honours kings can bestow. Now, sir, I will ask your royal brethren to fall <b>back,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> wish to speak with you." ...|$|E

60|$|Joh.
