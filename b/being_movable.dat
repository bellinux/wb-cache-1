60|$|The {{peculiarities of}} the pump {{referred}} to were, first, and most obvious, {{that it had}} no outer wooden case or box, and the parts were exceedingly few and simple. It was on the lever principle, the cylinders, instead of the pistons, <b>being</b> <b>movable.</b> The pistons were fixed to a bed-plate and pointed upwards, so that the pump was, as it were, turned upside down, a position which, among other advantages, allowed of the plungers being covered with water, through which the air was forced and partially cooled. Another and important peculiarity was an air-reservoir which received air from the pump direct, and then passed it on to the diver, so that even if the pumps should stop working there would still be a supply of air flowing down to the diver for several minutes. The lamp referred to was also a novelty, inasmuch as it was supplied with air by a separate tube from the reservoir {{in the same way as}} if it were a separate human diver. The Henkie and Davis lamp burns, on the other hand, entirely without air, by means of certain acids. That of Siebe and Gorman is an electric-lamp. Both are said to be effective and economical.|$|E

Twelve metal cans of one-gallon each containing four explosive surrogates and eight inert materials were used as targets. Nine materials in five-gallon cans including three explosive surrogates were also used. The SBRS method indicated a capability to distinguish the explosive surrogates in both experiments, although the five gallon targets gave more accurate results.
