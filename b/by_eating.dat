5|$|Like most crows, {{they will}} {{scavenge}} at landfills, scattering garbage in the process. Where available, corn, wheat {{and other crops}} are a favorite food. These habits have historically caused the American crow {{to be considered a}} nuisance. However, it is suspected that the harm to crops is offset by the service the American crow provides <b>by</b> <b>eating</b> insect pests.|$|E

In 1991, farm workers {{in the state of}} Paraíba, Brazil, were infected <b>by</b> <b>eating</b> contaminated food; transmission has also occurred via contaminated açaí palm fruit juice and garapa.

Jackals also harm the fur industry <b>by</b> <b>eating</b> muskrats caught in traps or taking skins left out to dry.|$|E

5|$|Mild iron {{deficiency}} {{can be prevented}} or corrected <b>by</b> <b>eating</b> iron-rich foods and by cooking in an iron skillet. Because iron is a requirement for most plants and animals, {{a wide range of}} foods provide iron. Good sources of dietary iron have heme-iron, as this is most easily absorbed and is not inhibited by medication or other dietary components. Three examples are red meat, poultry, and insects. Non-heme sources do contain iron, though it has reduced bioavailability. Examples are lentils, beans, leafy vegetables, pistachios, tofu, fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals.|$|E

5|$|One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been {{introduced}} into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse <b>by</b> <b>eating</b> both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted {{the growth of the}} Mnemiopsis population. The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem, as Beroe preys on other ctenophores.|$|E
5|$|Other mammals can be destructive. Possums {{tend not}} to eat {{the leaves of the}} tree, but are very fond of eating the sugar-rich {{flowering}} stalks as they emerge. They also like using the tree as a sleeping place. Rabbits can be more destructive, especially during periods of drought, when they have been seen to eat through the base until a tree falls, and then eating the fallen tree completely. Horses can also fell a tree <b>by</b> <b>eating</b> through the trunk.|$|E
5|$|The adult Iago sparrow feeds {{mainly on}} the seeds of grass and grain (the main cereal crop grown in Cape Verde is maize), but also on insects and plant shoots. They can do damage to crops <b>by</b> <b>eating</b> young leaves, and like house sparrows will eat the food scraps {{available}} near houses. Nestlings, by contrast to adults, are fed almost exclusively on insects, especially caterpillars, flies, and orthopterans. The Iago sparrow forages mostly on the ground, moving restlessly whilst clinging to the ground like a mouse.|$|E

5|$|The bulk of {{the water}} intake of Hemilepistus reaumuri is by taking up water vapour from {{saturated}} air and <b>by</b> <b>eating</b> damp sand. Water loss is minimised by the rectal epithelium, which absorbs water, ensuring that the faeces is drier than the food the animal consumed. Evaporation of water through the permeable exoskeleton may, however, provide a valuable cooling effect.|$|E
5|$|Upon death, the Slugcat {{returns to}} the last {{hibernation}} save point and loses any map progress made since.

Karma is restored upon reaching a new hibernation area, and the player can shield their current karma level <b>by</b> <b>eating</b> a yellow flower. The flower appears at the start of each area and is re-planted wherever the Slugcat dies.|$|E

The game's bright and {{colorful}} visuals and dynamic music soundtrack were hallmarks of the game, earning it several awards from the gaming press in 2006. While the game did not sell high volumes, its success {{led to the development}} of four other LocoRoco titles – two sequels for the PSP (PlayStation Portable)/PSP Go, a spin-off for the PlayStation 3 and a mobile version (called LocoRoco Mobile and LocoRoco Hi, depending on the market) for cellular (mobile) telephones.|$|E
