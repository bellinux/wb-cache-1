5|$|In {{previous}} works, Hergé {{had drawn}} upon {{a variety of}} pictorial sources, such as newspaper clippings, from which to draw the scenes and characters; for The Secret of the Unicorn he drew upon an unprecedented variety of these sources. In drawing {{many of the old}} vessels, Hergé initially consulted the then recently published L'Art et la Mer ("Art and the Sea") by Alexandre Berqueman. Seeking further accurate depictions of old naval vessels, Hergé consulted a friend of his, Gérard Liger-Belair, who owned a Brussels shop specialising in model ships. Liger-Belair produced plans of a 17th-century French fifty-gun warship for Hergé to copy; Le <b>Brillant,</b> which had been constructed in Le Havre in 1690 by the shipwright Salicon and then decorated by Jean Bérain the Elder.|$|E

25|$|Vice Adm. Huygens,now aboard Loos' former {{flagship}} the Faam, {{continued the}} chase {{and the action}} was resumed the following day between Goiana and Cabo Branco. The Dutch fought a long-range battle using their superior artillery, but the only ship lost that day was the Dutch Soleil <b>Brillant,</b> badly damaged and sank with its commander and 44 soldiers. On 14 January Huygens renewed the attack off Paraíba. The Portuguese galleon of Capt. António da Cunha Andrade was captured, and another Spanish vessel of the Squadron of Castile ran aground and was boarded while fighting the Dutch Zwaan. Its crew under the Neapolitan Colonel Ettore della Calce was taken prisoner. The Dutch Zwaan, under Rear Admiral Aldrichsz, lost its mainmast and, washed away, ran aground on the coast.|$|E
500|$|The {{next day}} the <b>Brillant</b> showed up, unaware of what had just transpired. [...] Her captain had misjudged the {{distance}} from St. Augustine and had made landfall further north before turning around. [...] General Arbousset landed his troops east of Charles Town, but the <b>Brillant</b> was captured by the colonial fleet; Arbousset and his men surrendered after suffering 14–30 killed in a brief battle with the English militia. [...] The prisoners included 90 to 100 Indians; most of these were [...] "sold for slaves".|$|E

[...] Troops landed near Charles Town were quickly driven off by militia called out by Governor Nathaniel Johnson when word of the fleet's approach reached the area, and an improvised flotilla commanded by Colonel William Rhett successfully captured the <b>Brillant,</b> which arrived after the other five ships had already sailed away in defeat.|$|E

500|$|The Spanish fleet arrived off {{the harbor}} bar on September 4 (this date is {{recorded}} in contemporary English documents and histories such as Francis Le Jau's diary, as August 24 due to {{differences between the}} Julian calendar then in use in the English colonies, and the modern Gregorian calendar). [...] Despite {{the absence of the}} <b>Brillant,</b> which carried much of the French force, including [...] "the campaign guns, shovels, spades, shells, and the land commander" [...] (the latter being General Arbousset), Captain Lefebvre and his fleet crossed the bar on September 7, and delivered an ultimatum the next day. [...] He demanded a ransom of 50,000 Spanish pesos, threatening to destroy Charles Town if it was not paid. [...] Governor Johnson contemptuously dismissed the demand as paltry, claiming the town was worth 40 million pesos, and that [...] "it had cost much blood, so let them come".|$|E
500|$|The French fleet sailed from St. Augustine on August 31. During {{the passage}} a sloop was spotted, and the <b>Brillant</b> gave chase; she {{consequently}} became {{separated from the}} rest of the squadron. [...] The sloop was a privateer sent out by Carolina governor Nathaniel Johnson to intercept Spanish supply ships; its captain quickly returned to Charles Town with word of the fleet's movement. [...] The countryside and town, then also suffering the ravages of a yellow fever epidemic, rallied in response to Governor Johnson's calling out of the militia. The exact number of militia mustered is not known; of the non-slave population of 4,000, an estimated 900 men served in the colonial militia. Anticipating that a landing would be attempted on James Island, which guarded the southern approach to the harbor, Johnson posted the militia there under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Rhett. The northern point of James Island was fortified by Fort Johnson, which housed a few cannon whose range was inadequate to prevent ships from entering the harbor. [...] The militia also improvised a small flotilla of ships, which even included a fire ship.|$|E

2500|$|The composers of {{the first}} half of the 19th century were acutely aware of the {{conversational}} paradigm established by Haydn and Mozart.

An inconclusive action followed for about two hours in mid-afternoon. The French broke off the action and the British vessels were too damaged to be able to catch them up again. In the action the British suffered 11 men killed and 53 wounded; Seahorse alone lost three men killed and five wounded.|$|E
2500|$|From 1826 to 1828, Schubert resided {{continuously}} in Vienna, {{except for}} a brief visit to Graz in 1827. The history of his life during these three years was comparatively uninteresting, and {{is little more than}} a record of his compositions. In 1826, he dedicated a symphony (D. 944, that later came to be known as the Great C major) to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde and received an honorarium in return. In the spring of 1828, he gave, for the only time in his career, a public concert of his own works, which was very well received. The compositions themselves are a sufficient biography. The String Quartet No. 14 in D minor (D. 810), with the variations on Death and the Maiden, was written during the winter of 1825–1826, and first played on 25 January 1826. Later in the year came the String Quartet No. 15 in G major, (D 887, first published as op. 161), the Rondo in B minor for violin and piano (D. 895), Rondeau <b>brillant,</b> and the Piano Sonata in G major, (D 894, first published as Fantasie in G, op. 78). To these should be added the three Shakespearian songs, of which [...] "" [...] (D. 889) and [...] "" [...] (D. 891) were allegedly written on the same day, the former at a tavern where he broke his afternoon's walk, the latter on his return to his lodging in the evening.|$|E
