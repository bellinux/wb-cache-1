5|$|The {{situation}} regarding Manahi's VC recommendation {{during the}} Battle of Takrouna still rankled with {{many members of}} the Māori Battalion but while he was alive, Manahi's modesty and unwillingness to <b>bring</b> <b>any</b> attention to himself meant that he was not interested in changing the situation. Following his death, the Manahi VC Committee was established by his former comrades and iwi to lobby for an upgrade to his award.|$|E

5|$|After {{developing}} the core {{concepts of the}} show, Abrams began to seek studios to develop the show; Abrams' past successes led to Warner Bros. Television and the Fox Television Network to quickly jump on board the project. Peter Roth, {{the chief executive of}} Warner Bros. Television, had been actively seeking to <b>bring</b> <b>any</b> Abrams' project to his studio, and heard Abrams' pitch for Fringe at a dinner meeting in August 2007. Similarly, Kevin Reilly, the entertainment chairman at Fox, knew that it was critical for him to bring the next Abrams' project to his network, and worked with Roth to assure this would happen.|$|E
5|$|Ernest Mangnall was {{the first}} man to <b>bring</b> <b>any</b> major {{silverware}} to the club, winning the club's first ever Football League title in 1908. This was followed by the FA Cup the following season, and another league title in 1911. Despite this success, though, he left the club a year later to join local rivals Manchester City. Coincidentally, Mangnall's last match in charge of United was the Old Trafford derby of 7 September 1912. John Bentley took over as club secretary, but was replaced two years later by Jack Robson, who became the club's first full-time manager. He remained in the post for seven years, but resigned in December 1921 after succumbing to a bout of pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|In 1796, a German {{engineer}} {{found that}} the area had suitable clay for the making of faience, and two years later, founded the Mezhyhirya Faience Factory, {{the first one in}} Ukraine, {{at the site of the}} unused monastery. By 1852, the faience factory had become the largest industrial complex in Kiev. During its existence, the factory produced a variety of crockery and ornamental vases and figurines. In 1884, the faience factory was closed down after it failed to <b>bring</b> <b>any</b> profit.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} Rushden, Westley was {{appointed}} caretaker manager of Conference North outfit Kettering Town {{for the rest}} of the 2006–07 season in April 2007. Due to the date he joined, Westley was unable to <b>bring</b> <b>any</b> new players in to bolster the squad, with just two games remaining until the end of the season. His first game in charge was a 0–0 draw away to Stalybridge Celtic, shortly followed by a 1–0 loss to Alfreton Town at Rockingham Road – this was enough to ensure Kettering finished the season in second place. He managed Kettering in the play-offs, as they were beaten on penalties by Farsley Celtic in the semi-final after a 1–1 aggregate scoreline over two legs, he left shortly after when his short-term contract expired in May 2007, managing the club for a total of four games.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, Tonight had {{occasionally}} stirred controversy {{like its}} predecessor. An {{example is the}} 2003 documentary Living with Michael Jackson (a Tonight special). Its airing resulted in the threat of legal action by Michael Jackson. The documentary gained a large audience, 15 million in the United Kingdom, and newspapers depicted Jackson in a negative light following the documentary. Jackson did not, ultimately, <b>bring</b> <b>any</b> case to court.|$|E
25|$|Pasteur {{started his}} {{experiments}} in 1857 and published his findings in 1858 (April issue of Comptes Rendus Chimie, Béchamp's paper appeared in January issue). Béchamp noted that Pasteur did not <b>bring</b> <b>any</b> novel idea or experiments. On the other hand, Béchamp was probably aware of Pasteur's 1857 preliminary works. With both scientists claiming priority on the discovery, a dispute, extending to several areas, lasted throughout their lives.|$|E

25|$|Wise {{started by}} {{improving}} the fitness of the side, and {{by bringing in}} a number of loan players, notably Alan Thompson. Unfortunately, he was unable to <b>bring</b> <b>any</b> consistency to the side (not helped by injuries to Thompson and fellow new signing Tore André Flo after playing just 3 and 2 games respectively; Flo did not play again that season), and by May 2007 Leeds were relegated from the Championship after entering voluntary administration.|$|E
25|$|The {{king was}} so {{infatuated}} with Santhumala that he assented. Under his orders eleven of his wives had {{both of their}} eyes gouged out, but the youngest one had only one eye removed.

Then the king instructed his servants not to <b>bring</b> <b>any</b> food and not to help the Twelve Sisters in any way.|$|E

25|$|The {{second stage}} of the {{proposal}} was to extend the line into the Taupo industrial area. The line would extend from the proposed log-processing yard around the southern flank of Mount Tauhara and head north towards Broadlands Road before completing a horseshoe like curve south into the Taupo Mill on Centennial Drive. The report said the line {{would be used for}} transporting sawn timber from the processing yard to the mill on Centennial Drive. Forest industry people did not express an interest in this option, as they did not believe it would <b>bring</b> <b>any</b> new opportunities to them.|$|E
25|$|The Polish nobles {{were unhappy}} that their new king {{spent too much}} time on Lithuanian affairs. It was clear that the war could {{continue}} for years and would not <b>bring</b> <b>any</b> benefit to Poland. In 1392, Władysław sent Henry of Masovia with an offer to make Vytautas regent instead of Skirgaila. Vytautas accepted and again broke with the Order. He burned three Teutonic castles and returned to Vilnius. Jagiełło and Vytautas signed the Astrava Treaty in which Vytautas recovered all Kęstutis' lands, including Trakai, and was given more. Vytautas would rule Lithuania in the name of Władysław. After Vytautas' death, all his lands and powers would revert to Władysław.|$|E
25|$|Sun Ra was {{personally}} responsible {{for the vast majority}} of the constant changes in the Arkestra's lineup. According to contrabassist Jiunie Booth, a member of the Arkestra, Sun Ra did not confront any musician whose performance he was unsatisfied with. Instead, he would simply gather the entire Arkestra minus the offending musician, and skip town—leaving the fired musician stranded. After repeated instances of U.S. jazz musicians becoming stranded in foreign countries, Sun Ra's unique method of dismissal became a diplomatic liability for the United States. The U.S. State Department was compelled to tell Sun Ra to <b>bring</b> <b>any</b> fired musicians stateside rather than leave them stranded.|$|E
