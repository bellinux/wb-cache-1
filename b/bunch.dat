5|$|In 1967, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts {{producers}} Kenneth Hyman and Phil Feldman {{were interested}} in having Sam Peckinpah rewrite and direct an adventure film called The Diamond Story. A professional outcast due to the production difficulties of his previous film Major Dundee (1965) and his firing from the set of The Cincinnati Kid (1965), Peckinpah's stock had improved following his critically acclaimed work on the television film Noon Wine (1966). An alternative screenplay available at the studio was The Wild <b>Bunch,</b> written by Roy Sickner and Walon Green. At the time, William Goldman's screenplay Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had recently been purchased by 20th Century Fox. It was quickly decided that The Wild <b>Bunch,</b> which had several similarities to Goldman's work, would be produced in order to beat Butch Cassidy to the theaters.|$|E

40|$|The main {{laws that}} govern gentle <b>bunching</b> of Space Charge-Dominated (SCD) beam are considered. It is shown that SCD-beam <b>bunching</b> depends on two main parameters: {{the first one}} determines the <b>bunching</b> quality, another one is measure for <b>bunching</b> process duration. The changes in <b>bunching</b> process {{depending}} on this parameters and on low of RF-field amplitude increase are described. The optimal conditions of SCD-beam <b>bunching</b> are discussed. The computer codes ZHALO generated for <b>bunching</b> beam characteristic visual representation are described. An adiabatic <b>bunching</b> section must be presented at a high-current ion linac for beam loss prevention. The problem is to choose an optimal length of the section as well as optimal values for synchronous phase and accelerating field amplitude. In order to clear up the main regularities of the <b>bunching</b> process the simplest model was used by analogy with the previous case. In {{the context of this}} model the beam without transverse motion and with fixed transverse size is moving inside a channel with bore radius R.
