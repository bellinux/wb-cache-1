In Egypt, <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> has no value and is available at no cost all year. Incubation and germination experiments were conducted to assess the potential of using <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> and compost to increase soil fertility and squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) growth in a calcareous soil. Amendments were two rates of <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> (13. 5, 26. 7 gkg− 1), two rates of compost (24. 7, 49. 4 gkg− 1), a blend of lowest rates of compost and <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> and a control. Treatments were mixed with calcareous soil, placed in pots and incubated anaerobically under field conditions for one month. After incubation 15 squash seeds were planted in the soil pots. Highest rate of <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> most effectively increased soil water holding capacity, organic matter, macronutrients, micronutrients, germination parameters, and reduced soil pH. Mixing compost with <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> was more effective than high rate of compost in increasing water holding capacity, soil nutrients, and decreasing soil pH.

The <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> charcoal contains fixed carbon of 81 % and ash of 12 %, and the ash content is fairly high {{compared with that}} in the sawdust charcoal.

The efficiency of immobilization and operation and storage stabilities of free and immobilized enzyme on the supports were studied. The enzyme activity, kinetic parameters and the peptide profile of the protein hydrolysates from free and immobilized enzyme were also analysed.

The <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> replaced 0 (control), 30, 60 or 100 % of the fish meal protein. Feed DM intakes and growth rates were reduced as the dietary levels of <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> were increased, with the effect being more marked in the finishing phase. Contrasting results were obtained for feed DM conversion, with apparently better conversion on the diets with <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> in the growing phase, but poorer conversion on these diets in the finishing phase. A 30 % replacement level appeared to give the best economic return. An on-farm trial was conducted with 4 households with 4 pigs in each with initial weights of 40 to 46 kg.

It is produced in large quantities (20 kg per 100 liters of produced beer) throughout the year at a low cost or no cost, and due to its high protein and carbohydrates content {{it can be used}} as a raw material in biotechnology. Biotechnological processes based on renewable agro-industrial by-products have ecological (zero CO 2 emission, eco-friendly by-products) and economical (cheap raw materials and reduction of storage costs) advantages. The use of brewer’s <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> is still limited, being basically used as animal feed. Researchers are trying to improve the application of brewer’s <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> by finding alternative uses apart from the current general use as an animal feed. Its possible applications are in human nutrition, as a raw material in biotechnology, energy production, charcoal production, paper manufacture, as a brick component, and adsorbent. In biotechnology brewer’s <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> could be used as a substrate for cultivation of microorganisms and enzyme production, additive of yeast carrier in beer fermentation, raw material in production of lactic acid, bioethanol, biogas, phenolic acids, xylitol, and pullulan.

The aim of this work was to study the mechanisms of brewing yeast immobilization onto <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> particles through the information on physicochemical surface properties of brewing yeast and <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> particles. Three mechanisms of brewing yeast immobilization onto <b>spent</b> <b>grains</b> carrier were proposed: cell-carrier adhesion, cell-cell attachment, and cell adsorption (accumulation) inside natural shelters (carrier’s surface roughness). The possibility of stable cell-carrier adhesion regarding the free energy of interaction was proved and {{the relative importance of}} longrange forces (Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory) and interfacial free energies was discussed.

40|$|The use of {{industrial}} wastes for wastewater treatment {{as a strategy}} to their re-use and valorisation may provide important advances toward sustainability. The present work gives new insights into heavy metal biosorption onto low-cost biosorbents, studying chromium(III) biosorption onto <b>spent</b> <b>grains</b> residual from a Portuguese brewing industry both in batch and expanded bed column systems. Experimental studies involved unmodified <b>spent</b> <b>grains</b> and <b>spent</b> <b>grains</b> treated with NaOH. Metal uptake followed a rapid initial step, well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model up to 27 h, indicating chemisorption to be the rate-limiting step. Beyond this period intraparticle diffusion assumed {{an important role in}} the uptake global kinetics. The best fit for equilibrium data was obtained using the Langmuir model, with unmodified <b>spent</b> <b>grains</b> having the higher maximum uptake capacity (q max = 16. 7 mg g 1). In open system studies, using expanded bed columns, the best performance was also achieved with unmodified spent grains: Breakthrough time (C/C i = 0. 25) and total saturation time (C/C i = 0. 99) occurred after 58 and 199 h of operation, corresponding to the accumulation of 390 mg of chromium(III), 43. 3 % of the total amount entering the column. These results suggest that alkali treatment does not improve <b>spent</b> <b>grains</b> uptake performance. Changes in biomass composition determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy suggested hydroxyl groups and proteins to have an important role in chromium(III) biosorption.

The objective of this work is to evaluate the effect of a specific solid phase – <b>spent</b> <b>grains</b> – on homogeneous regime stability and regime transition. <b>Spent</b> <b>grains</b> are cellulose-based particles that have been used to immobilize cells on biotechnology process. These particles are wettable and have a density close to water and its influence on bubble column reactors is particularly important in order to establish the limits were both regimes prevail.
