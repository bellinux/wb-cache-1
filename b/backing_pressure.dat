Theoretically, a centrifugal pump, a side channel pump, or a regenerative pump {{could be used to}} back to atmospheric pressure directly, but currently there is no commercially available turbopump that exhausts directly to atmosphere. In most cases, the exhaust is connected to a mechanical backing pump (usually called roughing pump) that produces a pressure low enough for the turbomolecular pump to work efficiently. Typically, this <b>backing</b> <b>pressure</b> is below 0.1 mbar and commonly about 0.01 mbar. The <b>backing</b> <b>pressure</b> is rarely below 10−3 mbar (mean free path ≈ 70 mm) because the flow resistance of the vacuum pipe between the turbopump and the roughing pump becomes significant.|$|E
40|$|The energy {{absorption}} efficiency of high-intensity (similar to 10 (16) W/cm(2)) femtosecond laser pulses in a dense jet of large rare-gas clusters has been measured. Experimental {{results show that}} the {{energy absorption}} efficiency is strongly dependent on the cluster size and can be higher than 90 %. The measurement of the ion energy indicates that the average ion energies of argon and xenon can be as high as 90 and 100 keV, respectively. The dependence of the average energy of the ions on the cluster size is also measured. At comparatively low gas <b>backing</b> <b>pressure,</b> the average ion energies of argon and xenon increase with increasing gas <b>backing</b> <b>pressure.</b> The average ion energy of argon becomes saturated gradually with further increase of the gas <b>backing</b> <b>pressure.</b> For xenon, the average ion energy drops a little after the gas <b>backing</b> <b>pressure</b> exceeds 9 bar (3. 2 x 10 (5) atoms/cluster).

In an experimental investigation of the relation between neutral gas density and <b>backing</b> <b>pressure,</b> it is found that the resulting number density for helium is ∼ 30 % higher than for hydrogen at the same <b>backing</b> <b>pressure.</b> The observed differences in electron beam properties between the two gases can thus be explained by differences in plasma electron density.

The results show that high <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> has a significant adverse effect on the operation and reliability of the engine. The response to fluctuating <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> is strongly non-linear, and depends on the amplitude and period of the fluctuations. For a constant output load, the exhaust gas temperature increases significantly with increasing <b>back</b> <b>pressure,</b> leading to reduced engine reliability.

However, water at exhaust outlet creates a flow resistance for the exhaust gases, which {{adds to the}} <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> High <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> reduces the operating limits of an engine, increases fuel consumption, {{and can lead to}} exhaust smoke. While the effects of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> were recognized earlier, {{there is a lack of}} experimentally validated research on the performance limits of a turbocharged, marine diesel engine against high <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> for the entire operating window. The focus of this research is to provide a comprehensive understanding of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> effects on marine diesel engine performance, and to identify limits of acceptable <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> along with methods to tackle high <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> In this work, a pulse turbocharged, medium speed, diesel engine was tested at different loads and engine speeds; against different values of static <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> Additionally, mean value model simulations could be validated and were used to compare the performance of a pulse and constant pressure turbocharged engine against high <b>back</b> <b>pressures</b> of 1  meter water-column (mWC), and for two different values of valve overlap. Using the validated simulation model, the conceptual basis for the engine smoke limit as well as for thermal overloading is investigated. A methodology applying the conceptual basis to define boundaries of acceptable <b>back</b> <b>pressures</b> has been presented in this paper.

40|$|Using {{time-of-flight}} spectrometry, {{the interaction}} of intense femtosecond laser pulses with argon clusters has been studied by measuring the energy and yield of emitted ions. With two different supersonic nozzles, the dependence of average ion energy (E) over bar on cluster size (n) over bar in a large range of (n) over bar approximate to 3 x 10 (3) similar to 3 x 10 (6) has been measured. The experimental results indicate that when the cluster size (n) over bar <= 3 x 10 (5), the average ion energy (E) over bar proportional to (n) over bar (0. 5), Coulomb explosion is the dominant expansion mechanism. Beyond this size, the average ion energy gets saturated gradually, the clusters exhibit a mixed Coulomb-hydrodynamic expansion behavior. We also find that with the increasing gas <b>backing</b> <b>pressure,</b> there is a maximum ion yield, the ion yield decreases as the gas <b>backing</b> <b>pressure</b> is further increased...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{gas cell}} as a target for laser wakefield {{acceleration}} (LWFA) offers the possibility to obtain stable and manageable laser-plasma interaction process, a mandatory condition for practical applications of this emerging technique, especially in multi-stage accelerators. In order to obtain full control of the gas particle number density in the interaction region, thus allowing for a long term stable and manageable LWFA, real-time monitoring is necessary. In fact, the ideal gas law cannot be used to estimate the particle density inside the flow cell based on the preset <b>backing</b> <b>pressure</b> and the room temperature because the gas flow depends on several factors like tubing, regulators, and valves in the gas supply system, as well as vacuum chamber volume and vacuum pump speed/throughput. Here, second-harmonic interferometry is applied to measure the particle number density inside a flow gas cell designed for LWFA. The results demonstrate that real-time monitoring is achieved and that using low <b>backing</b> <b>pressure</b> gas (< 1 bar) and different cell orifice diameters (< 2 mm) {{it is possible to}} finely tune the number density up to the 1019 cm- 3 range well suited for LWFA...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find the relationship between the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> and the noise level. <b>Back</b> <b>pressure</b> needs to be kept to a minimum. The relationship between the noise and the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> is inversely proportional; lowering the noise level at the tip will result in high <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> However, this relationship is undesirable as the requirement is to have a quiet muffler with a small <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> (ideal muffler).

40|$|Samples of {{electrolytic}} {{tough pitch}} (ETP) pure copper {{were subjected to}} 12 passes of Equal-Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) at room temperature with and without <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> Subsequent annealing was performed to evaluate the influence of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> during ECAP on the thermal behavior of ultrafine-grained copper. The microstructural and hardness changes caused by annealing were characterized by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) and microhardness measurements. The application of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> resulted in an earlier drop in hardness upon annealing, which {{is believed to be}} associated with a lower critical temperature for the initiation of recrystallization and a rapid coarsening of microstructure. Regardless of whether <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> was applied or not, structure coarsening during short-time annealing of ECAP-processed copper was governed by discontinuous static recrystallization. This is seen as a result of microstructure heterogeneity. Analysis of recrystallization kinetics was carried out based on observations of the microstructure after annealing in terms of the Avrami equation. The magnitude of the apparent activation energies for recrystallization in the absence of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> {{and in the case of}} <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> of 100 MPa was estimated to be ~ 99 kJ/mol and ~ 91 kJ/mol, respectively.

The general trend of the proton energy dependence on {{the square of the}} average cluster radius, which is determined by a calibrated Rayleigh scattering measurement, is similar to that described by theory under the single size approximation. Calculations are made to fit the experimental results under a simplified model by taking into account both a log-normal cluster size distribution and the laser intensity attenuation in the interaction volume. A very good agreement between the experimental proton energy spectra and the calculations is obtained in the high- energy part of the proton energy distributions, but a discrepancy of the fits is revealed in the low-energy part at higher backing pressures which are associated with denser flows. A possible mechanism which would be responsible for this discrepancy is discussed. Finally, from the fits, a variation of the cluster size distributions was revealed to be dependent on the gas <b>backing</b> <b>pressure</b> {{as well as on the}} evolving time of the gas flow of clusters...|$|E
