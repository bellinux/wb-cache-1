The sale of offices became extremely corrupt under the eunuch-dominated government of Emperor Ling of Han (r. 168–189 AD), when many top official posts were sold at the highest bidder instead of <b>being</b> <b>filled</b> by vetted candidates who had taken Imperial examinations or attended the Imperial University.|$|E

The highly cornified bristles are arranged in tight clusters of three to six individual bristles, with each bristle <b>being</b> <b>filled</b> with pulp. The authors considered the bristles as being homologous to the quills of Tianyulong, the elongated broad filamentous feathers (EBFFs) of Beipiaosaurus, and possibly the feathers of birds as well. Similar bristles are found in extant birds such as the horned screamer; these structures differ from feathers in {{that they do not}} develop from a follicle, but both arise from discrete cell populations. A darkened soft-tissue structure was also found near the jugal horn; this may represent a keratinous sheath or a skin flap.|$|E
5|$|In 1785 {{the castle}} {{was bought by}} the Oxford County Justices and {{rebuilding}} began under the London architect William Blackburn. The wider castle site {{had already begun to}} change by the late 18th century, with New Road being built through the bailey and the last parts of the castle moat <b>being</b> <b>filled</b> in to allow the building of the new Oxford Canal terminus. Building the new prison included demolishing the old college attached to St George's chapel and repositioning part of the crypt in 1794. The work was completed under Daniel Harris in 1805. Harris gained a reasonable salary as the new governor and used convict labour from the prison to conduct early archaeological excavations at the castle {{with the help of the}} antiquarian Edward King.|$|E
5|$|Ipswich Town F.C. {{were elected}} to The Football League on 30 May 1938 {{by a margin}} of just two votes, at the expense of Gillingham F.C., {{initially}} playing in Division Three (South).

5|$|Sacred zebu {{were kept}} in a sunken cattle pen (fahimasina) {{to the west of}} the kianja {{courtyard}} before sacrifice at royal events such as circumcisions and the fandroana festival. Only the two most highly prized types of zebu were kept here: black zebu with white markings on the forehead, called volavita, and entirely reddish-brown zebu, called malaza. In this way, the cattle were made to walk from the west toward the east (the direction of the ancestors and sanctity) before being slaughtered. Another large pen for sacrificial zebu was located to the northeast of this courtyard before <b>being</b> <b>filled</b> in by the French Colonial Authority in the late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The Xel'Naga then {{discovered}} the Zerg, small parasitic larvae that could control the nervous systems of other species. The Xel'Naga {{saw this as}} purity of essence, and guided {{the evolution of the}} Zerg as well. However, the Zerg were animals, concerned only with self-preservation. To help further the Zerg as a species, the Xel'Naga created the Overmind, a central consciousness to organize the Zerg. They hid their existence from the Overmind, however. On becoming aware of their existence (after <b>being</b> <b>filled</b> with an overriding directive it could not fight off), the Overmind attacked the Xel'Naga, infesting and destroying the greater whole of the race.

5|$|The {{reforms of}} the {{execution}} movement had clearly established the Sejm as the central and dominant organ of state power. But this situation in reality had not lasted very long, as various destructive decentralizing tendencies, steps taken by the szlachta and the kings, were progressively undermining and eroding the functionality and primacy of the central legislative organ. The resulting void was <b>being</b> <b>filled</b> during the late 16th and 17th centuries by the increasingly active and assertive territorial sejmiks, which provided a more accessible and direct forum for szlachta activists to promote their narrowly conceived local interests. Sejmiks established effective controls, in practice limiting the Sejm's authority; themselves they were taking on an ever-broader range of state matters and local issues.|$|E
5|$|A life of Augustine {{was written}} by Goscelin around 1090, but this life portrays Augustine in a {{different}} light than Bede's account. Goscelin's account has little new historical content, mainly <b>being</b> <b>filled</b> with miracles and imagined speeches. Building on this account, later medieval writers continued to add new miracles and stories to Augustine's life, often quite fanciful. These authors included William of Malmesbury, who claimed that Augustine founded Cerne Abbey, the author (generally believed to be John Brompton) of a late medieval chronicle containing invented letters from Augustine, and a number of medieval writers who included Augustine in their romances. Another problem with investigating Augustine's saintly cult is the confusion resulting because most medieval liturgical documents mentioning Augustine do not distinguish between Augustine of Canterbury and Augustine of Hippo, a fourth-century saint. Medieval Scandinavian liturgies feature Augustine of Canterbury quite often, however. During the English Reformation, Augustine's shrine was destroyed and his relics were lost.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{long-term}} {{solutions to}} the Isabel Inlet such as building a bridge or a ferry system were considered, though they were ultimately cancelled in favor of pumping sand and filling the inlet. Coastal geologists were opposed to the solution, stating {{the evolution of the}} Outer Banks is dependent on inlets from hurricanes. Dredging operations began on October 17, about a month after the hurricane struck. The United States Geological Survey used sand from the ferry channel to the southwest of Hatteras Island, a choice made to minimize impact to submerged aquatic vegetation and due to the channel <b>being</b> <b>filled</b> somewhat during the hurricane. On November 22, about two months after the hurricane struck, Highway 12 and Hatteras Island were reopened to public access. On the same day, the ferry between Hatteras and Ocracoke was reopened.

5|$|Like other ankylosaurids, Ankylosaurus had {{cervical}} half-rings (armor {{plates on}} the neck), {{but these are}} only known from fragments, making their exact arrangement uncertain. Carpenter suggested that when seen from above, the plates would have been paired, and created an inverted V-shape across the neck, with the midline gap probably <b>being</b> <b>filled</b> with small ossicles (round bony scutes) to allow for movement. He believed the width of this armor belt was too wide to have fitted solely on the neck, and that it covered {{the base of the}} neck and continued onto the shoulder region. Paleontologists Victoria M. Arbour and Philip J. Currie disagreed with Carpenter's interpretation, and pointed out that the cervical half-ring fragments of specimen AMNH 5895 did not fit together in the way proposed by Carpenter (though this could be due to breakage). They instead suggested that the fragments represented the remains of two cervical half-rings, which formed two semi-circular plates of armor around {{the upper part of the}} neck, as in the closely related Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, while US battleships were {{standardized}} {{as much as}} possible, design improvements {{were incorporated}} whenever possible. Most {{of the changes in}} the Tennessees were incorporated prior to any of their keels being laid. However, plans for the underwater protection—the ships' main defense against torpedoes and shells that fell short of the ship but traveled through the water to hit underneath the waterline—could not be worked out in time. The problem was that tests in caissons—experiments that would eventually prove that a series of compartments divided between <b>being</b> <b>filled</b> with liquid and being left empty would be a very effective defense against torpedoes—were not yet complete. In order to commence construction of the ships as soon as possible, bids sent out to shipbuilding corporations noted that if they were selected to build the ships, an alteration to the design of the ships three months after their keels were laid must be allowed.|$|E
