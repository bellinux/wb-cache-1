Based around his church in the village of Mbombwe in the south-east of the country, the revolt was centred on the black middle class and encouraged by grievances against the colonial system, including forced labour, discrimination and the new demands on the indigenous population caused by the outbreak of World War I.|$|E

5|$|After Charles Parham began {{promoting}} {{the idea that}} speaking in tongues was the initial evidence of the baptism in the Spirit around 1901, he began to attract a considerable following which he organized loosely as the Apostolic Faith Movement (AFM) in 1906. However, {{with the rise of}} the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles, California, and an accusation of sodomy against him in 1907, he lost and never recovered his influence. After renouncing Parham, the severely weakened AFM regrouped around Howard A. Goss, L. C. Hall, D. C. O. Opperman, and A. G. Canada. They were later joined by Eudorus N. Bell, previously a Southern <b>Baptist</b> <b>minister.</b> The AFM had its strength in the rural areas of Kansas, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri.|$|E

He then courted Beth Newell, a cashier in Saskatoon, and by 1922, the two were engaged. However, in 1923, Newell was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and Diefenbaker broke off contact with her. She died the following year. Diefenbaker was himself subject to internal bleeding, and may have feared that the disease would be transmitted to him. In late 1923, he had an operation at the Mayo Clinic for a gastric ulcer, but his health remained uncertain for several more years.|$|E

His family, which according to the blues historian Steven Calt included at least one younger brother named Carl, moved to the agriculturally rich community of Marlin, where Johnson {{spent most of his}} childhood. There, the Johnson family attended church—most likely the Marlin Missionary Baptist Church—every Sunday, a practice which had a lasting impact on Johnson and fueled his desire to be ordained as a <b>Baptist</b> <b>minister.</b> When Johnson was five years old, his father gave him his first instrument—a cigar box guitar.|$|E

5|$|With no {{resources}} available from either Congress or the Continental Army, Irvine gave permission for volunteers to organize their own offensive. Detroit {{was too far}} and too strong for a small-scale operation, but militiamen such as David Williamson believed that an expedition against the American Indian towns on the Sandusky River was feasible. It {{was to be a}} low-budget campaign. Each volunteer had to provide at his expense a horse, rifle, ammunition, rations, and other equipment. Their only payment would be an exemption from two months of militia duty, plus whatever plunder might be taken from the Indians. Because of ongoing Indian raids—the wife and children of a <b>Baptist</b> <b>minister</b> were killed and scalped in western Pennsylvania on May 12, 1782—there was no shortage of men willing to volunteer.|$|E
