5|$|Brooker {{had other}} ideas that {{were removed from}} the {{original}} script because they would <b>be</b> <b>complicated</b> to do. He said he could use these ideas in a sequel story which would involve the main character finding messages that she had left for herself on previous days as the process of erasing her mind starts to not function. However, as the location for the episode no longer exists, he felt it would be more practical to create a graphic novel instead of recreating the scenario.|$|E
5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, there is a tendency for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas. This is known as out-gassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure reduces the partial pressure of the inert gas in the lungs. This process may <b>be</b> <b>complicated</b> by the formation of gas bubbles, and the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E
5|$|Later, in Tunisia, Marita Covarrubias {{arranges}} for {{the release}} of Alex Krycek from a penal colony. Upon returning to the United States, the two meet with the wheelchair-bound Smoking Man, who tells them that an alien craft has crashed in Oregon. The Smoking Man sees the crash as a chance to rebuild the Project, but claims that finding it will <b>be</b> <b>complicated.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the swifts <b>is</b> <b>complicated,</b> with {{genus and species}} boundaries widely disputed, especially amongst the swiftlets. Analysis of behavior and vocalizations <b>is</b> <b>complicated</b> by common parallel evolution, while analyses of different morphological traits and of various DNA sequences have yielded equivocal and partly contradictory results.|$|R
5|$|Limitations include that a {{consistent}} set of gases {{must be used}} which match the specific ratio model, and the specific ratio will only be relevant to a limited range of depths. As the parameters {{move away from the}} base conditions, conservatism will diverge, and the probability of symptomatic bubble formation will become more unpredictable. There is also the requirement for the diver to do mental arithmetic at depth to calculate the parameters of a safety-critical operation. This may <b>be</b> <b>complicated</b> by adverse circumstances or an emergency situation.|$|E
5|$|Other {{potential}} {{causes of}} {{signs and symptoms}} that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis {{that need to be}} ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus. Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered. The differential diagnosis can <b>be</b> <b>complicated</b> somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).|$|E
5|$|The outputs of a {{structural}} alignment are a superposition {{of the atomic}} coordinate sets and a minimal {{root mean square deviation}} (RMSD) between the structures. The RMSD of two aligned structures indicates their divergence from one another. Structural alignment can <b>be</b> <b>complicated</b> by the existence of multiple protein domains within {{one or more of the}} input structures, because changes in relative orientation of the domains between two structures to be aligned can artificially inflate the RMSD.|$|E

5|$|Treatment is with {{anticoagulants}} (medication that suppresses blood clotting), {{and rarely}} thrombolysis (enzymatic {{destruction of the}} blood clot). Given that there is usually an underlying cause for the disease, tests may be performed to look for these. The disease may <b>be</b> <b>complicated</b> by raised intracranial pressure, which may warrant surgical intervention such as the placement of a shunt.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{symptoms}} are frequently {{lacking in the}} elderly. The presentations may be vague with incontinence, a change in mental status, or fatigue as the only symptoms, while some present to a health care provider with sepsis, an infection of the blood, as the first symptoms. Diagnosis can <b>be</b> <b>complicated</b> {{by the fact that}} many elderly people have preexisting incontinence or dementia.|$|E
5|$|If OHS is suspected, various {{tests are}} {{required}} for its confirmation. The most important initial test is the demonstration of elevated {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This requires an arterial blood gas determination, which involves taking a blood sample from an artery, usually the radial artery. Given that it would <b>be</b> <b>complicated</b> to perform this test on every patient with sleep-related breathing problems, some suggest that measuring bicarbonate levels in normal (venous) blood would be a reasonable screening test. If this is elevated (27mmol/l or higher), blood gasses should be measured.|$|E

5|$|Physicians: There are {{multiple}} aspects as to why, financially, hospice care {{may be difficult}} to access. The first would relate to physician reluctance. As stated previously, when enrolled in hospice, the patient transitions from their primary insurance to having most of their care managed directly by the hospice. As hospices typically have a limited budget, expensive care may not be permitted by the hospice. Additionally, reimbursement for physician visits can <b>be</b> <b>complicated</b> and result in non-payment to physicians. Therefore, difficulty in authorizing expensive treatments and lack of payment for visits can be reasons for non-referral from a physician.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{conditions}} associated with thrombophilia are {{deep vein thrombosis}} (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which are referred to collectively as venous thromboembolism (VTE). DVT usually occurs in the legs, and is characterized by pain, swelling and redness of the limb. It may lead to long-term swelling and heaviness due to damage to valves in the veins. The clot may also break off and migrate (embolize) to arteries in the lungs. Depending on the size {{and the location of}} the clot, this may lead to sudden-onset shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations and may <b>be</b> <b>complicated</b> by collapse, shock and cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} is much drabber than most African swallows, and {{confusion}} is unlikely except with other crag martins or with sand martins {{of the genus}} Riparia. It is 15% smaller, paler and greyer than the Eurasian crag martin, and has smaller tail spots. It is smaller, paler, and has a more contrasting throat than the rock martin. In the far east of its range, the pale crag martin always has lighter underparts than the dusky crag martin. Although only slightly larger than the sand martin and brown-throated sand martin, the pale crag martin is more robust, has white tail spots, and lacks a breast band. Separation of similar species in flight may <b>be</b> <b>complicated</b> by the difficulty of judging colours accurately in strong desert light, particularly with juveniles. The fast flight of the brown-throated sand martin also makes identification more difficult.|$|E

5|$|Those {{parts of}} the {{memorandum}} that demanded Lithuanian autonomy and protested the possible attachment of Suwałki Governorate to autonomous Poland were reprinted in the Russian publication Pravitel'stvennyi Vestnik on November 23 (November 10 O.S.). The Russian government sought to demonstrate that granting autonomy to both Poland and Lithuania would <b>be</b> <b>complicated,</b> and would probably exacerbate national conflicts. On November 26 (November 13 O.S.) the memorandum was also reprinted in Vilniaus žinios. It was heavily criticized by non-Lithuanians for its position on minorities and by Lithuanians for making demands {{on behalf of the}} Lithuanian nation without waiting for the Seimas' resolutions.|$|E
5|$|While countersteering {{is usually}} {{initiated}} by applying torque {{directly to the}} handlebars, on lighter vehicles such as bicycles, {{it can also be}} accomplished by shifting the rider’s weight. If the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, the bike leans to the left to conserve angular momentum, and the combined center of mass remains nearly in the same vertical plane. This leftward lean of the bike, called counter lean by some authors, will cause it to steer to the left and initiate a right-hand turn as if the rider had countersteered to the left by applying a torque directly to the handlebars. This technique may <b>be</b> <b>complicated</b> by additional factors such as headset friction and stiff control cables.|$|E
5|$|Many populations, {{particularly}} in the Sydney region, inhabit areas of infrequent disturbance, such as golf courses, disused industrial land, brick pits, and landfill areas. Though {{once one of the}} most common frogs in south-east Australia, the green and golden bell frog has endured major population declines, {{particularly in}} highland areas, leading to its current classification as globally vulnerable. Its numbers have continued to fall and are threatened by habitat loss and degradation, pollution, introduced species, and parasites and pathogens, including the chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. As most of the remaining populations live on private land, the logistics of the conservation effort can <b>be</b> <b>complicated.</b> Despite the situation in Australia, some frog populations have survived with more success in New Zealand and several other Pacific islands, where it has been introduced. However, unfortunately even in these areas the population of green and golden bell has been rapidly declining in the past few decades.|$|E
