40|$|A new {{generation}} of gas filter media is becoming available, based on rigidly bonded ceramic granules or fibres, and suitable for high temperature duty. This papers outlines the main considerations in selecting and applying such a medium. Pressure drop through a 'virgin' medium is readily predictable from simple tests at ambient conditions. Behaviour on 'conditioning' over many cycles of filtration and cleaning can be determined by a simple 'coupon test', which shows the range of filter velocities {{which can be used}} and the cleaning action needed. Low density media have some advantages, and this paper concentrates on one such medium which has been found to have good performance: Cerafil 12 H 10, formed as a <b>bonded</b> <b>mat</b> of synthetic ceramic fibres. It is currently supplied as cylindrical candles, but other geometries are under development. Experience in using Cerafil to filter gases generated by a pyrolytic incinerator treating contaminated soil is outlined...|$|E

30|$|It is {{well known}} that density affects IB strength. Quantitative {{evaluation}} is needed for the next study concerning on how plateau temperature and vapor pressure affect IB, as both are affected by density. Density had a linear relationship with plateau temperature and IB, and plateau temperature had a linear relationship with IB and a non-linear relationship with vapor pressure. A non-linear relationship was also found for vapor pressure with plateau temperature and IB. This implies that vapor pressure influenced inter-particle <b>bonding</b> within the <b>mat.</b> To optimize final board performance, the effect of vapor pressure must be minimized during panel production.|$|R

Relationships between the tensile strength properties of the different structural levels of the fiber mats were studied and fiber bundles as structural elements of fiber mats were modeled by idealized statistical fiber bundles developed by the Department of Polymer Engineering, BUTE. The geometrical and mechanical measurements were carried out by image processing methods and a computer aided tensile tester. The results proved that the modeling method gave a tool in understanding the failure behavior of the fiber mat samples and studying {{the effect of the}} structural parameters. The applicability of the modeling method is demonstrated by the good agreement with some measurements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental and analytical studies concerning the flexural strengthening of RC beams using externally <b>bonded</b> Slurry Infiltrated <b>Mat</b> CONcrete (SIMCON) laminates. A total of four reinforced concrete beams were cast and tested in the laboratory over an effective span of 3000 mm. Three beams were strengthened with bonded SIMCON laminate at the bottom under virgin condition and tested until failure; the remaining one beam was used as control specimen. Static responses of all the beams were evaluated in terms of strength, stiffness, ductility ratio, energy absorption capacity factor, compositeness between laminate and concrete, and the associated failure modes. The theoretical moment-curvature relationship for the test specimen and the load-displacement response of the strengthened beams and control beam were predicted by using FEA software ANSYS. Comparison was made between the numerical (ANSYS) with the experimental and theoretical results. The results show that the strengthened beams exhibit increased flexural strength, enhanced flexural stiffness, and composite action until failure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Damages {{existing}} in masonry engineering structures {{are caused by}} various loads {{and has to be}} repair because of structural and architectural requirements. Repair of cracked masonries using materials of high stiffness and low deformability, like lime and cement mortars or epoxy resins, does not increase significantly the tensile strength of the repair joint. This is because of the stress concentration occurrence. The use of highly deformable bonding materials allows reducing peaks of stress concentration, causing (after repair) increase of strength of cracked masonry elements. Proposed repair materials of high deformability can be easily covered with original masonry material to ensure protection of architectural value. In the paper, there were tested masonry units (bricks), investigated in two kinds of loading. One of them was the four point bending test on Polish Bonarka bricks and the second one was the Single Lap Shear Test on Italian Rosso Vivo- A 6 R 55 W bricks, strengthened using CFRP and SRP strips bonded on epoxy resin. In both cases, the primary failure appeared in form of cracks (or detachment) going through the brick materials. The failure surfaces of both tests were repaired using materials of low and high deformability. More significant strength increase of the tested masonry elements (after repair) was obtained {{in the case of the}} use of highly deformable interface materials than of barely deformable bonding materials. Efficiency of highly deformable repair materials was also examined as repair on cracked masonry walls in laboratory using polymer injection and externally <b>bonded</b> composite <b>mats</b> made of glass fibers bonded on highly deformable polymer. Additionally, the highly deformable polymer joints were tested dynamically in situ on a masonry building, up to failure also...|$|R
