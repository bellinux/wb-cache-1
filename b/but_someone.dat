5|$|Elvis {{might never}} have been born, <b>but</b> <b>someone</b> else would surely have brought the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic {{accounts}} for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a would-be Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world's first and greatest rock 'n' roll beatnik bard and then—having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning—vanish into a folk tradition of his own making.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifeboats}} were lowered {{every few}} minutes on each side, {{but most of the}} boats were greatly under-filled. No.5 left with 41 aboard, No.3 had 32 aboard, No.8 left with 39 and No.1 left with just 12 out of a capacity of 40. The evacuation did not go smoothly and passengers suffered accidents and injuries as it progressed. One woman fell between lifeboat No.10 and the side of the ship <b>but</b> <b>someone</b> caught her by the ankle and hauled her back onto the promenade deck, where she made a second successful attempt at boarding. First-class passenger Annie Stengel broke several ribs when an overweight German-American doctor and his brother jumped into No.5, squashing her and knocking her unconscious. The lifeboats' descent was likewise risky. No.6 was nearly flooded during the descent by water discharging out of the ship's side, but successfully made it away from the ship. No.3 came close to disaster when, for a time, one of the davits jammed, threatening to pitch the passengers out of the lifeboat and into the sea.|$|E

Bryant shot Janet Quin in the back, where she fell, unable to move, near Royce Thompson.|$|E
25|$|Yamaguchi {{intentionally}} {{tried to}} create uncool and old-fashioned lyrics, in order to juxtapose with the song's modern sound. He wrote the lyrics an hommage to kayōkyoku pop lyrics of the 1970s and 1980s, specifically the songs of Momoe Yamaguchi and Akina Nakamori. Yamaguchi felt that stylistically, the song's chorus melody was directly inspired by Shōwa period kayōkyoku, <b>but</b> <b>someone</b> unfamiliar with the genre might misinterpret as purely inspired by dance music. After Yamaguchi finished songwriting, the band's guitarist Motoharu Iwadera arranged the initial demo, with bassist Ami Kusakari later reworking the demo to blend Iwadera's style with hers.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 18 April 2012, the website of The Scotsman {{newspaper}} made available an extended 6 minute 23 second video of the proceedings. The extended video comprises visual footage from the standardised 4 minute 40 second video but a different audio track. The extended version is of note, because the audio track comprises 66 seconds of Jack Davidson QC's plea in mitigation. It was previously stated in the press that this specifically would not be filmed. Also included in the extended version is 4 seconds of heckling {{from members of the}} public gallery as David Gilroy is being led away. The majority of the heckling is inaudible, <b>but</b> <b>someone</b> can clearly be heard shouting 'die' before a court room police officer says 'quiet please'.|$|E
25|$|Barbara Guinn Tidwell is {{the founder}} of the team, and served as their {{director}} and choreographer from their creation in the fall of 1960 to her retirement in the spring of 1997. After high school graduation, she attended Kilgore Junior College where she was a Kilgore College Rangerette. After Kilgore, she and three other Rangerettes chose the University of Southern Mississippi to complete their Bachelor degrees, with Tidwell receiving her degree in history. Tidwell was teaching at Galveston High School in the late 1950's, when she applied for a position at Southwest Texas State hoping to teach history there. The School President, Dr. Jack Flowers, said he wasn’t looking for a history teacher <b>but</b> <b>someone</b> with dance expertise who could create a team to keep fans in their seats at halftime.|$|E
25|$|Their second {{film was}} Dead Presidents in 1995. Dealing {{with the black}} {{underclass}} society like their feature film debut, and also starring Larenz Tate, the film centered on war veterans during the racially charged Vietnam War era. The film, which was released at the New York Critics Film Festival, failed to make {{as much of a}} profit as their first film. They followed Dead Presidents with American Pimp, a feature-length documentary about the underground pimp culture and exploitation of women. It premiered at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival. They had originally set out to do an adaptation of Iceberg Slim's novel Pimp, <b>but</b> <b>someone</b> else acquired the rights. The brothers have stated that the film's perspective was partially shaped by being raised by their mother, who is a feminist. In between projects, they filmed several anti-handgun public service announcements.|$|E

25|$|Yet {{given the}} factions and jealousies {{that arise in}} any court and that Hephaestion was supremely close to the {{greatest}} monarch the western world had yet seen, it is remarkable how little enmity he inspired. Arrian mentions a quarrel with Alexander's secretary Eumenes but, because of a missing page in the text, {{the greater part of}} the detail is missing, leaving only the conclusion that something persuaded Hephaestion, though against his will, to make up the quarrel. However, Plutarch, who wrote about Eumenes in his series of Parallel Lives, mentions that it was about lodgings and a flute-player, so perhaps this was an instance of some deeper antagonism breaking out into a quarrel over a triviality. What that antagonism might have been, {{it is not possible to}} know, <b>but</b> <b>someone</b> with the closeness to the king of a secretary might well have felt some jealousy for Hephaestion's even greater closeness.|$|E
25|$|Newkirk {{helped her}} mother {{out in the}} leper colony—packing pills and rolling bandages, {{stuffing}} toys for orphans, and feeding strays—and says that this informed her view that anyone in need, including animals, was worthy of concern, along with her mother's advice that it doesn't matter who suffers, but how. She {{tells the story of}} an early experience of trying to rescue an animal, when she heard laughter in the alleyway behind the family home in New Delhi. A group of people had bound a dog's legs, muzzled him, then lowered him into a muddy ditch, laughing as they watched him try to escape. Newkirk asked her servant to bring the dog to her, and {{tried to get him to}} drink some water, <b>but</b> <b>someone</b> had packed his throat with mud, and he died in her arms. She told the Financial Times that it was a turning point.|$|E
25|$|French {{people have}} one, {{two or more}} given names (first names). One of them (nowadays almost always the first, in the past often the last) is used in daily life (<b>but</b> <b>someone</b> can also choose a usage name that was not given); the others are solely for {{official}} documents, such as passport, birth, death and marriage certificates. Thus, one always speaks of Jacques Chirac and never of Jacques René Chirac; and Henri Philippe Pétain is always referred to as Philippe Pétain (or Marshal Pétain), because Philippe was the given name that he used in daily life. Middle names in the Anglo-Saxon sense do not exist, and middle initials are never used for second or further given names. For example, although English-speaking scientific publications may cite Claude Allègre as Claude J. Allègre, this is never done in France. Typically, second and further given names may be somewhat old-fashioned, given in honour of the child's grandparents etc., though such practice has now become less common. As with English, however, a person may choose to use any one (or several) of their names, relegating the unused names to the birth certificate. Although using more than one name is nowadays out of fashion, using two or even three of the given names as a compound name was fairly common until the early 20th century.|$|E
