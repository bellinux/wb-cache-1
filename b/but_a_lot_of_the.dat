25|$|In the United States, {{forensic}} entomology became {{well known}} through {{the trial of}} David Westerfield in 2002 for the abduction and murder of seven-year-old Danielle van Dam. In this San Diego case, the courtroom became a battle over conflicting reports from four forensic entomologists: David Faulkner, Neal Haskell, M. Lee Goff, and Robert D. Hall. A fifth scientist, William Rodriguez, a forensic anthropologist, also testified on this issue. Danielle had vanished from her bedroom the night of February 1–2; her partially decomposed body was found February 27. Haskell, Hall, and Faulker argued that forensic entomology established that the body of was dumped in mid-February, during which time Westerfield was already under police surveillance (since February 5), while Goff said the victim's body was colonized by larvae earlier than the other three entomologists estimated (his dates were February 9 to 14). His dates were earlier as he used new data from Canada which gives a significantly slower development for that fly species. Richard Merritt, a forensic entomologist and professor at Michigan State University, stated that because each scientist has his own method, {{this can lead to}} disagreement, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disagreements involve a variation of one or two days, not over {{a week and a half}} as in the Westerfield case: “If it's that big a time, someone screwed up”.|$|E

You've got to be right or wrong. I love the satisfaction when you are right — and the agony when you are wrong." [...] Hochuli finds similarities between the football field and courtroom saying, [...] "On the football field, people like that I'm in charge and know what I'm doing, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, it's just appearance. [...] I'm going to sell you on my decision. It's the same in the courtroom. You don't stand in front of a jury and say, 'I think my client is innocent.' You say, 'We're right!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Stone pursued {{other films}} of his own, Chernin was {{replaced}} by Thomas Rothman, and a drunken Sellers crashed his car, killing a much-loved colleague and earning jail time, while producers Murphy and Hamsher were paid off. [...] "After they got rid of us, they brought on Chris Columbus", Murphy stated. [...] "Then I heard they did tests of apes skiing, which didn't make much sense." [...] Stan Winston was still working on the makeup designs. Columbus brought Sam Hamm, his co-writer on an unproduced Fantastic Four script, to write the screenplay. [...] "We tried to do a story that was simultaneously a homage to the elements we liked from the five films, and would also incorporate {{a lot of material}} [...] that had been jettisoned from the earlier production," [...] Hamm continued. [...] "The first half of the script bore little resemblance to the book, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stuff in the second half comes directly from it, or directly inspired by it." ...|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin {{called this}} episode [...] "clumsy and tired", {{explaining}} it was [...] "misfiring on all cylinders. The satire was toothless, the playing strained {{and the whole}} enterprise reeked of mild desperation." [...] He continued in his recap that [...] "Let's Stay Together" [...] had a [...] "golden opportunity to comment insightfully and hilariously about the tricky intersection of politics, power, race and privilege", however [...] "it recycled jokes that were unfunny and overly familiar the first time around". In conclusion, Rabin gave it a C grade rating. Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student opined that the show's writing [...] "is still sharp– not 'as sharp as ever,' but sharp– <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most interesting plots have already played out, {{and a lot of}} the new plots aren't interesting." [...] Sanders said that the stories featured here had [...] "a few big laughs... but they're assembled so haphazardly and put into such a bulky framework that the train just never gets enough steam to salvage the episode." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mountain of Madness" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, {{although}} the script underwent many rewrites. According to Josh Weinstein, [...] "a Swartzwelder script is like a finely tooled crazy German machine {{and if you have}} the wrong engineers try to fix it, it blows up. And that's the thing, 'cause it had great jokes but we sort of changed the story and went through a bunch of drafts." [...] The story was completely rewritten and as a result, the plot became odder and quirkier with the scenes of paranoia deriving from this. The original script was [...] "really crazy" [...] <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more insane material was cut. However, most of the rewrites were done during the script-writing and did not require any major animation changes. One change was the ending, which was added after the animatic. The episode features several pairings of established characters who had previously interacted little, such as Waylon Smithers with Bart and Lisa. Weinstein feels that {{this was one of the}} first episodes to really feature the duo of Lenny Leonard and Carl Carlson and developed them more.|$|E
500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, and I did a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E

500|$|The 2003 season {{started with}} a 2916 win over the Chiefs in Hamilton. The win was notable because Highlander Willie Walker kicked eight {{penalties}} which was a competition record. They then defeated the Stormers and Bulls before losing to coach Laurie Mains’ old team the Cats in Johannesburg. Winger Aisea Tuilevu was banned for foul play following the match, and Highlander’s captain Tane Randell publicly criticised the South African judicial process. Their second loss of the season came when they played the Crusaders at Carisbrook. The Crusaders won 1716 to record to first loss for the Highlanders at Carisbrook since the 1999 finalwhich was also lost to the Crusaders. The Highlanders had gone three seasons, 2000, 2001 and 2002, and 16 games unbeaten at Carisbrook. The Highlanders then defeated the Blues 2211 to retain the Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy, and inflict the only loss of the season on the Blues who {{would go on to}} win the 2003 Championship. Following the Highlander’s 4519 defeat of the Brumbies on 25 April it was revealed that a rift had developed between coach Laurie Mains and some of the senior players in the squad. Anton Oliver was branded the ringleader by Mains, but Carl Hoeft said of the conflict; [...] "Anton got hung out as ringleader, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> players had issues with the way things were going and I was one of themI’m not going to hide from that". The Highlanders lost to the Waratahs at Carisbrook on 3 May, but were in a position to qualify for the semi-finals if they defeated the Queensland Reds in the last round. The Reds won 2823 and their season was over. The defeat was Mains’ last match as coach; he resigned as was replaced by his assistant Greg Cooper.|$|E
2500|$|Predicting {{critical}} reception to the {{new direction}} of the album, Cronise proposed that [...] "It will absolutely alienate some fans. The kind of music we play is partially described as heavy metal and unfortunately, a lot of dudes that like heavy metal are very narrow-minded and only like it to sound one particular way. So I'm sure we alienated people with our second album." [...] Despite this, he assured that {{the sound of the}} music would not change as much, explaining that [...] "There'll definitely still be heavy stuff on the record, and fast, thrashy, and slow and sludgy stuff like we've done before. Heavy metal, basically. <b>But</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs are just what I'd call hard rock songs. The attitude and the vibe is different. It's not as aggressive, sonically. It's a little bit more ... I don't know how to explain it. It's just rock. It's a rock album. Some parts will be heavier than the heaviest stuff we've done, but at the same time, there will be acoustic stuff. It is a varied record, I guess.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Eminem also {{addressed}} the mindstate he had {{while working on}} 2009's Relapse saying: [...] "It was interesting, man. I don't know if before Relapse, if we're talking the Infinite album and pre-signing with Dre and all that, from that point on, I don't know if I ever did anything or did much sober at all. Relapse was the first album and first recordings that I did when the lights went on and I was sober. I {{was still trying to}} figure things out...It's interesting. Fun time. I had a fun time." [...] and reiterated his feeling about the album [...] "I felt Relapse was, I don't know. I don't know if people know what I really had to go through {{to be able to make}} Relapse and to be able to write again and to be able to think again and just normal everyday bodily functions and functions in my mind. I don't want to say I wasn't in a place to record again, but I needed time. I needed time to be able to figure out things. I wanted to be able to make my songs feel like something again. I know a lot of stuff on Relapse was comical and funny punchline jokes, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs didn't really feel like anything. I had to go back and listen to some of my older music to try to figure out what I was doing wrong. Once I felt like I figured that out, I started making songs that felt like something again." ...|$|E
