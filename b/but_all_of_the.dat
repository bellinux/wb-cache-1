5|$|Aalborg Airport, officially {{opened in}} 1938 {{because of the}} success of the cement industry, had in fact {{operated}} flights to Copenhagen since 1936. During the German invasion of Denmark in 1940, the airport was captured by German paratroopers on the night of the 21 April as a base for German aircraft flying to Norway. On 13 August 1940, a dozen Bristol Blenheim bombers of No. 82 Squadron RAF were launched against the Luftwaffe airfield during one of the most disastrous Royal Air Force raids of the war. One turned back because of fuel problems, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining 11 were shot down by enemy fighters and/or flak batteries within 20 minutes. After the war, the Royal Air Force destroyed all the German facilities including planes, hangars and equipment but left the passenger facilities intact.|$|E
5|$|Hiryū began {{recovering}} her Midway strike {{force at}} around 09:00 and finished shortly by 09:10. The landed aircraft were quickly struck below, while the carriers' crews began preparations to spot aircraft for the strike against the American carrier forces. The preparations were interrupted at 09:18, {{when the first}} attacking American carrier aircraft were sighted. These consisted of 15 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers of VT-8, led by Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron from the Hornet. They attempted a torpedo attack on Soryū, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American planes were shot down by the 18 CAP fighters, leaving one surviving aviator treading water.|$|E

5|$|The soundtrack {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics; while several {{felt that the}} music was good and keeping in tone with the game, others {{found it to be}} odd and shallow. Several reviewers attributed the change to the lack of participation by Uematsu. Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission Original Soundtrack and Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection, on the other hand, were very well received by critics, who felt that they were far superior to the original soundtrack. The singles for the soundtrack were poorly received by critics, who found a few of the songs to be enjoyable <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> singles to be overpriced.|$|E
5|$|The Venezuelan intern Jhonny (JC Gonzalez) {{falls in}} love with April (Aubrey Plaza), who convinces him she is feared and very powerful. Jhonny is crazy and fell in love for April and sent her his car to pick her up but she used his car to go to movies with her friends. Meanwhile, Leslie tells the Venezuelans that she is seeking to raise $35,000 to fill in a pit to make a park. Raul and his colleagues start to laugh, telling her they have so much money from oil, they can build {{whatever}} they want. Leslie, who is growing increasingly annoyed with the Venezuelans, decides to take them to Pawnee's nicest park with hopes of impressing them. Instead, they are disgusted, and Raul mistakes the park for the aforementioned pit. Leslie later takes them to a public meeting to show them democracy in action, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> citizens shout angry and annoyed questions at Leslie. An unimpressed Raul wonders where are the armed guards to take the protestors to jail. When Raul tells Leslie they live like kings in Venezuela and answer to nobody, she explodes in anger, insulting their uniforms and Hugo Chavez. The Venezuelans storm out.|$|E

25|$|Ultimately, {{this issue}} of the studios' {{allegedly}} illegal trade practices led to all the major movie studios being sued in 1938 by the U.S. Department of Justice.

25|$|The Cloud City Miners' Union (CCMU), Local 33 of the WFM went {{on strike}} in 1896 over a {{reduction}} in wages that had persisted since the depression of 1893. The Coronado Mine was re-opened with armed replacement workers during the strike, and an incident on September 21 resulted in shooting and dynamite explosions. After surface buildings were burned, the Colorado governor sent the Colorado National Guard to Leadville.

25|$|What {{was unique}} about the Zisapels' {{business}} philosophy was that each company would operate independently, without a holding company, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> companies would {{be guided by}} them under a collective strategic umbrella. Companies may cooperate {{in the development of}} their solutions, engage in joint marketing activities and benefit from a common management structure. This decentralized business philosophy was designed to maximize the advantages inherent in smaller business units, such as flexibility, entrepreneurial spirit and management focus. As a result, since 1984, when the RAD Group came into being, it has spawned more than 185 companies, 8 IPOs and 19 mergers and acquisitions.|$|E

25|$|In Al-Jabr, al-Khwarizmi uses {{geometric}} proofs, he {{does not}} recognize the root x = 0, and he only deals with positive roots. He also recognizes that the discriminant must be positive and described the method of completing the square, though {{he does not}} justify the procedure. The Greek influence is shown by Al-Jabrs geometric foundations and by one problem taken from Heron. He makes use of lettered diagrams <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coefficients {{in all of his}} equations are specific numbers since he had no way of expressing with parameters what he could express geometrically; although generality of method is intended.|$|E
25|$|Proto-Germanic {{developed}} a strong stress accent {{on the first}} syllable of the root, but remnants of the original free PIE accent are visible due to Verner's Law, which was sensitive to this accent). That caused a steady erosion of vowels in unstressed syllables. In Proto-Germanic, that had progressed only {{to the point that}} absolutely-final short vowels (other than /i/ and /u/) were lost and absolutely-final long vowels were shortened, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early literary languages show a more advanced state of vowel loss. This ultimately resulted in some languages (like Modern English) losing practically all vowels following the main stress and the consequent rise of {{a very large number of}} monosyllabic words.|$|E
25|$|But at {{the onset}} of the American Civil War, Lincoln's {{postmaster}} general, Montgomery Blair faced a federal postal system regionally disabled by seceding states and disloyal postmasters. To prevent possible fraud potentially amounting to $270,000 in postage and stamped envelopes held in the South, the existing stamps were withdrawn and demonetized, and a new series of stamps was hurriedly issued. With the previous contract ending June 10, 1861, the Post Office Department signed a contract with the National Bank Note Company of New York City. Loyal postmasters in seceded states returned stamps to the Department. The new stamps were in use across the Union by mid-August 1861 with the same denominations and honoring the same persons as the previous issue, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> designs had changed.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Navy {{actually}} {{did not want}} to take delivery of many of the Lend-Lease ships because they were no longer useful and would be expensive to take custody of and dispose of; as a result some ships underwent a merely administrative transfer to U.S. custody to meet {{the letter of the law}} and then were sold for scrap in the Soviet Union or destroyed in Soviet waters under the direct observation of American naval authorities. The Soviet Union transferred two auxiliary motor minesweepers to the People's Republic of China, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other 97 Project Hula ships remaining in Soviet hands after the return of the 15 LCI(L)s in 1955 were either sold for scrap in the Soviet Union (81 ships) or (in the case of the other 16 ships) destroyed off its coast, presumably off Nakhodka.|$|E
25|$|After Finch {{published}} {{his work in}} 1937, few additional studies were done on volcano hazards in the Lassen area. However, that changed after the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington. As a result, the USGS began reevaluating the risks posed by other potentially active volcanoes in the Cascade Range, including those in Lassen Volcanic National Park. Since that time, USGS scientists have been working {{in cooperation with the}} National Park Service to better understand volcano hazards in the Lassen area. As part of this work, the history of Cinder Cone has been reexamined.
