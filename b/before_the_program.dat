5|$|The McDonnell XF-85 Goblin was an American {{prototype}} fighter aircraft conceived during World War II by McDonnell Aircraft. It {{was intended}} to be deployed from the bomb bay of the giant Convair B-36 bomber as a parasite fighter. The XF-85's intended role was to defend bombers from hostile interceptor aircraft, a need demonstrated during World War II. Two prototypes were constructed <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> was terminated.|$|E
5|$|The Tupolev Tu-85 (USAF/DoD {{reporting}} name 'Type 31', NATO reporting name Barge) was a Soviet prototype {{strategic bomber}} {{based on the}} Tu-4, an unlicensed reverse engineered copy of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. It was the ultimate development of the B-29 family, being over 50% heavier than its ancestor and had nearly double the range. Only two prototypes were built <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> was canceled {{in favor of the}} Tupolev Tu-95 bomber which was much faster and had the same range.|$|E
50|$|The {{books in}} the running for each edition of Canada Reads are {{announced}} several months <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>programs</b> are broadcast. Titles must be Canadian fiction, poetry or plays. They are promoted in bookstores, {{in the hope that}} the Canada Reads audience will purchase and read them all <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>programs</b> air. In some cases, publishers have published special editions of the nominated titles.|$|R

5|$|Advances {{of funds}} – Advances are federal funds {{provided}} to a recipient <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> activity is performed. Recipients determine the amount {{needed for a}} future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the amount {{to the federal government}} (or in the case of subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal funds received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase good or service or for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed, and recipients must try to minimize the amount of time between the receipts of funds to the actual disbursement. Examples of programs under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block Grant program.|$|E
5|$|On June 30, 2004, then-Mayor Newsom {{pledged to}} fix San Francisco’s {{homeless}} problem within 10 years and clear downtown streets of its widespread homeless population. He stated {{that people who}} were homeless and seriously ill would be given shelter. After 10 years and $1.5 billion, the city relocated 19,500 people off the streets, with 11,363 single adults being housed, and 8,086 people {{being sent to the}} home of a willing family member or friend though the Homeward Bound program. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> in 2002, there was a 8,640 generally homeless and 4,535 street homeless population in San Francisco. After the program was initiated, the homeless population dropped 28% by 2005, with a generally homeless population of 6,248 and a 2,655 street homeless population. However, after 2005, the homeless population has stayed approximately the same. In fact, the San Francisco population of homeless rose 3 percent between 2005 and 2013. The percentage of the homeless population in jail was cut in half between 2005 and 2013, which is an indicator that some of the homeless population who would have ended up in jail were now being housed and treated.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s, NSB {{electrified}} the Sørland Line, {{although the}} final section from Egersund to Stavanger was not converted until 1956. In 1957, the Kirkenes–Bjørnevatn Line became the only line to remove the electrification and replace the electric locomotives with diesel power. The 1950s saw the electrification of several regional and commuter lines around Oslo, including the Kongsvinger Line, the Trunk Line and the Dovre Line from Lillestrøm to Hamar, the Vestfold Line and the Eastern Østfold Line. This was largely due to NSB's program to remove all steam locomotives, either by electrification or by dieselization. In the late 1950s and 1960s, several to-be electrified lines were operated with diesel locomotives as an interim solution. The 1960s saw the remaining two steam lines in Southern Norway, the Bergen and Dovre Lines, electrified along with the Gjøvik Line. The Bergen Line was completed in 1964 and the Dovre Line completed in 1970. This finished all the planned electrifications, and the authorities deemed the remaining lines unprofitable to electrify because of low traffic. During the 1990s, a new program was attempted, this time to electrify the entire network, but only the Arendal Line was converted <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> was canceled. However, new lines around Oslo, including the Lieråsen and Oslo Tunnels on the Drammen Line, and the Gardermoen and Asker Lines were electrified {{at the time they}} opened. Further plans have been launched, in particular the section of the Nordland Line from Trondheim to Steinkjer, {{which is part of the}} Trøndelag Commuter Rail, and the Meråker Line, which connects to the electrified Central Line in Sweden.|$|E

25|$|The {{series was}} plagued by low ratings and {{negative}} reviews from critics throughout its run. The program also suffered from being scheduled in undesirable timeslots in certain markets; this was a particular case in New York City, the country's largest media market, where CBS owned-and-operated station WCBS-TV (channel 2) aired the program in a pre-dawn early morning slot, <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> moved to NBC O WNBC five months into its run in a 9:30a.m. slot, where it did not fare any better despite being placed in a more palatable time period (in contrast, CITY-TV in Toronto, Ontario, Canada , ran it at 5:00p.m.).) These setbacks led to the cancellation of the TV version of USA Today in November 1989 after one-and-a-half seasons; the final edition aired on January 7, 1990.|$|E
25|$|In mid-January {{when the}} boy band Fahrenheit were guests on the Chinese program, Super Winners (超级大赢家), fans had filed {{complaints}} toward the host, Frankie Kao, for his disrespectful and careless attitude towards Fahrenheit and their fans. Fans listed their arguments, criticizing Kao for being contemptuous; <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> was to be recorded Fahrenheit and their fans {{had to wait for}} over two hours because Kao had to practice his dance for the opening; when Aaron Yan accidentally had his eyes burnt by fireworks, Kao completely ignored his injury and continued on with the program. When fans began to worry and cry, he became annoyed and screamed at the fans to shut up. Fans also complained that when Fahrenheit was dancing, Kao had caused them to NG many times and therefore they were required to dance several more times. Fans witnessed an extremely exhausted Jiro Wang, who was {{almost to the point of}} collapsing after dancing. The ill Wu Chun was also a victim; fans had witnessed Kao requiring Wu to do health-risking activities when Wu was sick with a fever.|$|E
25|$|On 12 February 1997, {{two weeks}} before the album released, the band {{announced}} details for the PopMart Tour in the lingerie section of a K-Mart department store in New York City.

Narrated by actor Dennis Hopper, the documentary featured footage from the Pop recording sessions, as well as live footage from the opening PopMart show in Las Vegas, which took place the night <b>before.</b> <b>The</b> <b>program</b> received poor reception, ranking at 101 out of 107 programs aired that week, according to Nielsen ratings, and became the lowest rated non-political documentary {{in the history of the}} ABC network. Despite the low ratings, U2 manager Paul McGuinness appreciated the opportunity for the band to appear on network television in the first place, stating that the small audience for the television special was still a large audience for the band, as it was much larger than any audience that could be obtained by MTV.|$|E
