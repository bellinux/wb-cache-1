40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated that COS- 1 cell lines transformed by pSV 2 -gpt and maintained under <b>biochemical</b> <b>selection</b> replicate multiple copies of extrachromosomal plasmid DNA (1). We have now examined the replication {{and stability of}} this DNA in a representative cell line. In situ hybridization analyses revealed that intense replication of pSV 2 -gpt occurs in only a small subpopulation of cells and results from bursts of plasmid replication that occur periodically and spontaneously in the cell population. This suggests that COS- 1 cells are only semipermissive for pSV 2 -gpt replication. No correlation was observed between levels of pSV 2 -gpt replication and {{the presence or absence}} of <b>biochemical</b> <b>selection</b> for the Gpt marker. However, growth of cells under nonselective conditions led to a rapid and progressive loss of pSV 2 -gpt DNA. This loss correlated with segregation of Gpt- revertants that lacked detectable plasmid sequences. Hence, maintenance of pSV 2 -gpt in the cell line was dependent on continuous <b>biochemical</b> <b>selection.</b> Stable replication of pSV 2 -gpt could be observed as late as four months after transfection, suggesting that this system might be useful for propagation of cloned DNA in COS- 1 cells for extended periods of time. However, by nine months, extensive rearrangements of pSV 2 -gpt sequences were detected, indicating ultimate instability of the plasmid in the host cells. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Analysis {{of factors}} {{determining}} replication of BK virus (BKV) episomal vectors in human cells showed that vector copy number {{was related to}} the level of BKV T antigen expression. T antigen was synthesized efficiently, as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence, in vector-transfected primary embryonic fibroblasts undergoing neoplastic transformation. Surprisingly, transfected continuous cell lines (143 B, HeLa and KB), kept under <b>biochemical</b> <b>selection</b> or tested in transient assays, produced negligible amounts or no T antigen, revealed only by a sensitive ELISA test, suggesting that in these cells vector amplification was under the control of cellular factors. Presence or absence of BKV late region sequences, BKV strain, orientation of the inserted genes and presence or absence of selection were not relevant for vector replication. Type of <b>biochemical</b> <b>selection,</b> however, was important, since BKV vectors containing the thymidine kinase gene replicated better than those containing the neo gene. Despite great variability, vector copy number increased in transfected clones of adenovirus 5 -transformed 293 cells, in the absence of immunofluorescence detectable T antigen.

How is the post-transcriptional regulatory program of each mRNA encoded in its sequence? Hundreds of specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) appear to play roles in mediating the post-transcriptional regulatory program, {{akin to the}} roles of specific DNA-binding proteins in transcription. As a step toward decoding the regulatory programs encoded in each mRNA, we focused on specific mRNA– protein interactions. We computationally analyzed the sequences of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mRNAs bound in vivo by 29 specific RBPs, identifying eight novel candidate motifs and confirming or extending six earlier reported recognition elements. <b>Biochemical</b> <b>selections</b> for RNA sequences selectively recognized by 12 yeast RBPs yielded novel motifs bound by Pin 4, Nsr 1, Hrb 1, Gbp 2, Sgn 1 and Mrn 1, and recovered the known recognition elements for Puf 3, She 2, Vts 1 and Whi 3.

40|$|In {{somatic cell}} hybrids and cybrids of Nicotiana, {{research}} has indicated {{the presence of a}} hierarchy of organelle dominance between various species. This putative hierarchy was based on results using <b>biochemical</b> <b>selection</b> of hybrids. I tested the possibility that <b>biochemical</b> <b>selection</b> pressure biased the results. Protoplasts of various alloplasmic substitutions of Nicotiana were fused together; heterologous fusion events were isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Leaves of plants regenerated from these fusion events were analyzed to identify the types of chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA present. ^ The results reported here indicate that the hierarchy of organelle dominance appears to be a real phenomenon, even when selective pressures are removed. Chloroplasts from Nicotiana undulata strongly outcompeted chloroplasts from N. tabacum. Chloroplasts from N. suaveolens and N. glauca equally competed with chloroplasts from N. tabacum. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA revealed that mitochondria segregated independently from chloroplasts in the N. undulata - N. tabacum and N. glauca - N. tabacum fusions, but not in the N. suaveolens - N. tabacum fusions. After heterologous fusion events, mitochondrial DNA recombination was detected in some plants, but chloroplast DNA recombination was not observed. ^ In addition, male fertility was restored in a plant regenerated from a fusion between protoplasts of two cytoplasmic male sterile, alloplasmic substitutions. These alloplasmic substitutions contained the cytoplasm of N. suaveolens or N. plumbaginifolia, each in a N. tabacum nuclear background. Thus both nuclei were identical but each of the two protoplast types had the cytoplasm of either N. suaveolens or N. plumbaginifolia. The fertile plant contained N. plumbaginifolia chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA restriction patterns, and displayed a floral morphology intermediate between the N. plumbaginifolia alloplasmically substituted parent and fertile N. tabacum. The flowers of the fertile plant were only able to set seed when manually pollinated. ...|$|E

The pM 47 plasmid was introduced into T 98 G cells derived from a human glioblastoma multiforme tumor, and a stable clonal cell line, GM 47. 23, was derived that conditionally expressed wt-p 53 following exposure to dexamethasone. We show that induction of wt-p 53 expression in exponentially growing cells inhibits cell cycle progression and that the inhibitory effect is reversible upon removal of the inducer or infection with simian virus 40. Moreover, when growth-arrested cells are stimulated to proliferate, induction of wt-p 53 expression inhibits G 0 /G 1 progression into S phase and the cells accumulate with a DNA content equivalent to cells arrested in the G 0 /G 1 phase of the cell cycle.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can transfer mitochondria to the cells with severely compromised mitochondrial function. We tested whether the reported intercellular mitochondrial transfer could be replicated in different types of cells or under different experimental conditions, and tried to elucidate possible mechanism. Using <b>biochemical</b> <b>selection</b> methods, we found exponentially growing cells in restrictive media (uridine 2 and bromodeoxyuridine [BrdU]+) during the coculture of MSCs (uridine-independent and BrdU-sensitive) and 143 B-derived cells with severe mitochondrial dysfunction induced by either long-term ethidium bromide treatment or short-term rhodamine 6 G (R 6 G) treatment (uridine-dependent but BrdU-resistant). The exponentially growing cells had nuclear DNA fingerprint patterns identical to 143 B, and a sequence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) identical to the MSCs. Since R 6 G causes rapid and irreversible damage to mitochondria without the removal of mtDNA, the mitochondrial function appears to be restored through a direct transfer of mitochondria rather than mtDNA alone. Conditioned media, which were prepared by treating mtDNA-less 143 B r 0 cells under uridine-free condition, induced increased chemotaxis in MSC, which was also supported by transcriptome analysis.

Immunoprecipitation of pulse-labeled T antigen demonstrates a 5 - to 12 -fold {{increase in the}} rate of synthesis on addition of heavy-metal inducers to the culture medium. Radioimmunoassay of cell extracts indicates the accumulation of three- to fourfold more total T antigen after 2 days of induction by comparison with uninduced controls.

40|$|A {{selection}} {{strategy has}} been developed to identify amino acid residues involved in subunit interactions that coordinate the two half-reactions catalyzed by glutamine amidotransferases. The protein structures known for this class of enzymes have revealed that ammonia is shuttled over long distances and that each amidotransferase evolved different molecular tunnels for this purpose. The heterodimeric Escherichia coli imidazole glycerol phosphate (IGP) synthase was probed to assess if residues in the substrate amination subunit (HisF) are critical for the glutaminase activity in the HisH subunit. The activity of the HisH subunit is dependent upon binding of the nucleotide substrate at the HisF active site. This regulatory function has been exploited as a <b>biochemical</b> <b>selection</b> of mutant HisF subunits that retain full activity with ammonia as a substrate but, when constituted as a holoenzyme with wild-type HisH, impair the glutamine-dependent activity of IGP synthase. The steady-state kinetic constants for these IGP synthases with HisF alleles showed three distinct effects depending upon the site of mutation. For example, mutation of the R 5 residue has similar effects on the glutamine-dependent amidotransfer reaction; however, kcat/Km for the glutaminase half-reaction was increased 10 -fold over that for the wild-type enzyme with nucleotide substrate. This site appears essential for coupling of the glutamine hydrolysis and ammonia transfer steps and is the first example of a site remote to the catalytic triad that modulates the process.

40|$|The cylindromatosis tumor {{suppressor}} gene (Cyld) encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme (CYLD) with immunoregulatory function. In this study we evaluated the role of Cyld in T-cell ontogeny by generating a mouse (CyldD 9) with a thymocyte-restricted Cyld mutation that causes a carboxyl-terminal truncation of the protein and reciprocates catalytically inactive human mutations. Mutant mice had dramatically reduced single positive thymocytes and a substantial loss of peripheral T-cells. The analyses of polyclonal and TCR-restricted thymocyte populations possessing the mutation revealed a significant block in positive selection and the increased occurrence of apoptosis at the double-positive stage. Interestingly, {{in the context of}} MHC class I and II restricted TCR transgenes, lack of functional CYLD caused massive deletion of thymocytes that would have been positively selected, consistent with an impairment of positive <b>selection.</b> <b>Biochemical</b> analysis revealed that Cyld? 9 thymocytes exhibit abnormally elevated basal activity of NF-kB and JNK. Most importantly, inactivation of NEMO restored fully the NF-kB activity of CyldD 9 thymocytes to physiological levels and rescued their developmental and survival defect. Collectively, our study identified a fundamental role for functional CYLD in establishing the proper threshold of activation for thymocyte selection by a NEMO-dependent mechanism. In order to evaluate Cyld’s function in macrophages a a mouse (CyldD 9) was generated with a thymocyte-restricted Cyld mutation that causes a carboxyl-terminal truncation of the protein and reciprocates catalytically inactive human mutations.

40|$|Abstract Background Biochemical equilibria {{are usually}} modeled iteratively: given {{one or a}} few fitted models, if {{there is a lack of}} fit or over fitting, a new model with {{additional}} or fewer parameters is then fitted, and the process is repeated. The problem with this approach is that different analysts can propose and select different models and thus extract different binding parameter estimates from the same data. An alternative is to first generate a comprehensive standardized list of plausible models, and to then fit them exhaustively, or semi-exhaustively. Results A framework is presented in which equilibriums are modeled as pairs (g, h) where g = 0 maps total reactant concentrations (system inputs) into free reactant concentrations (system states) which h then maps into expected values of measurements (system outputs). By letting dissociation constants K d be either freely estimated, infinity, zero, or equal to other K d, and by letting undamaged protein fractions be either freely estimated or 1, many g models are formed. A standard space of g models for ligand-induced protein dimerization equilibria is given. Coupled to an h model, the resulting (g, h) were fitted to dTTP induced R 1 dimerization data (R 1 is the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase). Models with the fewest parameters were fitted first. Thereafter, upon fitting a batch, the next batch of models (with one more parameter) was fitted only if the current batch yielded a model that was better (based on the Akaike Information Criterion) than the best model in the previous batch (with one less parameter). Within batches models were fitted in parallel. This semi-exhaustive approach yielded the same best models as an exhaustive model space fit, but in approximately one-fifth the time. Conclusion Comprehensive model space based <b>biochemical</b> equilibrium model <b>selection</b> methods are realizable. Their significance to systems biology as mappings of data into mathematical models warrants their development. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} compare {{differential}} growth, physiological and biochemical responses of rice cultivars differing in salt tolerance, four rice cultivars; tolerant Pokkali (PK), moderately tolerant Luang Anan (LA) and two sensitive cultivars Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML 105) and Pathumthani 60 (PT 60) were grown in hydroponic culture for 2 weeks and then subjected to NaCl stress at 6 or 12 dS m - 1 for thirteen days. The tolerant cultivar (PK) exhibited clearly different pattern of {{responses from the}} other cultivars {{in most of the}} examined aspects including lower growth inhibition, lower inhibition of net photosynthetic rate, lower Na + /K + ratio in the shoots, less proline accumulation in the shoots, less membrane damage, lower hydrogen peroxide production, higher catalase and lower guaiacol peroxidase activities. Other parameters including Na + /K + ratio in roots, proline accumulation in roots and osmotic potential in both roots and shoots did not show appropriate association with the level of salt tolerance. The reduction in growth resulted from drastic reduction in net photosynthetic rate which was observed as early as 24 h after exposure to stress and continued to decrease dramatically. Growth retardation was also related to salt-induced accumulation of hydrogen peroxide which caused lipid peroxidation and membrane leakage. Higher catalase activity in the tolerant cultivar {{played an important role in}} combating the hydrogen peroxide, leading to less damage and higher tolerance. The activity of peroxidase was lower in the tolerant cultivar than in the sensitive ones. The observed negative relationship between the amount of proline accumulation and the level of salt tolerance did not support the widely advocated role of proline as an osmoprotectant under salt stress. Further investigation needs to be done to determine the role of this compatible osmolyte in salinity stress response in rice. For practical purpose, those parameters which showed differential pattern of responses including lower Na + /K + ratio in the shoots, less proline accumulation in the shoots, lower reduction in net photosynthesis rate, lower electrolyte leakage, lower hydrogen peroxide accumulation, higher catalase and lower guaiacol peroxidase activities may be regarded as potential <b>biochemical</b> indicators for <b>selection</b> of salt tolerant rice and targets for improvement through transgenic approaches...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{breeding}} is {{a combination}} of principles and methods of changing the genetic constitution of a plant to make it more suitable for human needs. Conventional plant breeding has evolved {{with the passage of time}} from simple seed saving of the best harvest to the selection of seeds according to the laws of Mendel. With the advent of morphological and <b>biochemical</b> markers, the <b>selection</b> process has hastened and the scope of conventional plant breeding increased many folds during the recent years. However, the process that actually revolutionized the plant breeding in the 20 th century was the realization that there exist a widespread polymorphism in natural populations, the degree of which can be assessed by sequencing or making restriction maps: an application of new tools of molecular biology. The first and the foremost molecular markers system i. e., restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was developed in early 1980. These are co-dominant markers and are available in unlimited number. Another breakthrough was the emergence of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 1990. With this technology, a new generation of DNA markers such as randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs), sequence characterized amplified regions (SCARs), sequence tagged sites (STS), single polymorphic amplification test (SPLAT), variable number of tendom repeats (VNTRs), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), DNA amplification fingerprinting (DFA), single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), micro-satellites or short tandem repeats (STRs), cDNA, DNA micro arrays and rDNA-ITS were introduced into the modern plant breeding systems. The concept of DNA based markers has increased our ability many folds, to follow minute regions of chromosome through opportunities such as map based cloning and Marker-assisted Plant (MAP) Breeding. In MAP breeding, the new ideas and concepts have been introduced which need to be understood thoroughly, before applying these ideas in practical breeding programmes particular in country like Pakistan where application of molecular biological approaches are still in its infancy. In order to achieve this objective, efforts were made to write a series of review articles in which concept of MAP breeding is being described thoroughly yet in a simple way so that student and researchers can build their understanding of plant molecular breeding and application of DNA based markers for the genetic dissection of qualitative and quantitative traits. In the present paper, concepts of MAP breeding and the type and characteristics of DNA markers is presented so that choice of the marker(s) can be made rational and for the defined purposes...|$|R
40|$|The {{changes that}} take place in the leaf apoplastic {{antioxidant}} enzymes system, protein and isoenzyme pattern in response to salts stress was studied in three onion (Allium ceba L.) cultivars, named Behary Red, Giza 6 and Giza 20. The constitutive level of lipid peroxidation and glutathione content (GSH), enzymes activity of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) as well as the protein and isoenzymes pattern were performed in the leaf of control (tap water, 200 ppm salts) and three concentrations of salt (2000, 4000 and 6000 ppm salts prepared from seawater (28000 ppm salts) stressed plants, 45 days after completing the stress treatments. The salt stress increased the rates of lipid peroxidation (as indicated by increasing the malonaldehyde (MDA) contents) and their effect was increased gradually by increasing salts levels. The increasing values in MDA contents in salt stress plants treated at 2000, 4000 and 6000 ppm salts levels were 121. 9, 248. 6 and 290. 3 % in Behary Red cv. and 126. 4, 260. 0 and 396. 2 % in Giza 20 cv., respectively of the control level (100 %). Generally, salts stress induced significant increase in the activities of the antioxidative enzymes CAT, POD and SOD in onion cvs., accompanied by increased in glutathione level. The GSH level was increased more in Behary Red cv. and Giza 20 cv., than in Giza 6 cv., at 6000 ppm salts. Their increasing values were 203. 7, 283. 3 and 242. 86 %, respectively compared to the control level (100 %). The leaf protein profile obtained by SDS-PAGE was diagnostic of characteristics different onion cultivars exposed to salts stress which, three distinct new protein bands with molecular weigh 50, 66 and 80 kDa were produced in Giza 6, Giza 20 and Behary Red onion cultivars, respectively. Also, electrophoretic bands of POD and CAT isoenzyme of different onion cultiver were differ in numbers and relative concentration due to salts stress. This finding suggested that Behary onion cultiver is better protected against lipid peroxidation process, inherently and under salts stress, than Giza 6 and Giza 20 onion cultivers. Also, the new protein bands and the characteristic CAT and POD isoenzymes banding patterns {{could be used as a}} <b>biochemical</b> marker for <b>selection</b> of salt tolerance onion plants when grown under salts stress...|$|R
40|$|Miscanthus is a {{perennial}} energy grass {{characterized by a}} high productivity and resource-use efficiency, making it an ideal biomass feedstock {{for the production of}} cellulosic biofuels and a wide range of other biobased value-chains. However, the large-scale commercialization of converting biomass into cellulosic biofuel is hindered by our inability to efficiently deconstruct the plant cell wall. The plant cell wall is a complex and dynamic structure and its components are extensively cross-linked into an unyielding matrix. The production of biofuel depends on the extraction, hydrolysis and fermentation of cell wall polysaccharides, which currently requires energetically and chemically intensive processing operations that negatively affect the economic viability and sustainability of the industry. To address this challenge it is envisioned that the bioenergy feedstocks can be compositionally tailored to increase the accessibility and extractability of cell wall polysaccharides, which would allow a more efficient conversion of biomass into biofuel under milder processing conditions. Extensive phenotypic and genetic diversity in cell wall composition and conversion efficiency was observed in different miscanthus species, including M. sinensis, M. sacchariflorus and interspecific hybrids between these two species. In multiple experiments a twofold increase in the release of fermentable sugars was observed in ‘high quality’ accessions compared to ‘low quality’ accessions. The exhaustive characterization of eight highly diverse M. sinensis genotypes revealed novel and distinct breeding targets for different bioenergy conversion routes. The key traits that contributed favourably to the conversion efficiency of biomass into biofuel were a high content of hemicellulosic polysaccharides, extensive cross-linking of hemicellulosic polysaccharides (revealed by a high content of trans-ferulic acids and a high ratio of arabinose-to-xylose), a low lignin content and extensive incorporation of para-coumaric acid into the lignin polymer. Lignin is widely {{recognized as one of the}} key factors conveying recalcitrance against enzymatic deconstruction of the cell wall. The incorporation of para-coumaric acid into the lignin polymer is hypothesized to make lignin more easily degradable during alkaline pretreatment, one of the most widely applied processing methods that is used to pretreat biomass prior to enzymatic hydrolysis. Previous studies have shown that reducing lignin content is often implicated in reduced resistance of plants to lodging. We hypothesize that extensively cross-linked hemicellulosic polysaccharides may fulfil a similar function in supporting cell wall structural rigidity and increasing the content of hemicellulosic polysaccharides may be a way to reduce lignin content without adversely affecting cell wall rigidity. This strategy can be used to improve biomass quality for biobased applications, as hemicellulosic polysaccharides are more easily degradable during industrial processing than lignin. Furthermore, hemicellulosic polysaccharides adhere to cellulose, which negatively affects the level of cellulose crystallinity. Crystalline cellulose is harder to degrade than its more amorphous form. Therefore the reduction of cellulose crystallinity is another mechanism through which increasing the content of hemicellulosic polysaccharides positively contributes to cell wall degradability. These results provided new insights into the traits that may be targeted to improve the quality of lignocellulose feedstocks.   However, evaluation of complex <b>biochemical</b> traits for <b>selection</b> purposes is hindered by the fact that their accurate quantification is a costly, lengthy and laborious procedure. To overcome these limitations an accurate and high-throughput method was developed based on near-infrared spectroscopy. Through extensive calibration we developed accurate prediction models for a wide range of biomass quality characteristics, which may be readily implemented as a phenotyping tool for selection purposes. Additionally, progress through breeding may substantially be improved by marker-assisted selection, which will reduce the need for the evaluation of genotype performance in multi-year field trials. To this end, a biparental M. sinensis mapping population of 186 individuals was developed and genotyped using a genotyping-by-sequencing approach. A total of 564 short-sequence markers were used to construct a new M. sinensis genetic map. Cell wall composition and conversion efficiency were observed to be highly heritable and quantitatively inherited properties. This is the first genetic study in miscanthus to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for biomass quality properties and is a first step towards the application of marker-assisted selection for biomass quality properties. Through the evaluation of a diverse set of miscanthus genotypes in multiple locations we demonstrated that in addition to genotypic variation, growing conditions may have a substantial influence on cell wall composition and conversion efficiency. While further research is needed to identify which specific environmental parameters are responsible for the observed effects, these results clearly indicate that the environmental influence on biomass quality needs to be taken into account in order to match genotype, location and end-use of miscanthus as a lignocellulose feedstock. Moreover, significant genotype-by-environment interaction effects were observed for cell wall composition and conversion efficiency, indicating variation in environmental sensitivity across genotypes. Although the magnitude of the genotypic differences was small in comparison to genotype and environmental main effects, this affected the ranking of accession across environments. Stability analysis indicated some stable accessions performed relatively across diverse locations. In addition to trialing miscanthus in diverse locations, we also evaluated miscanthus biomass quality under drought conditions for a number of reasons: 1) drought stress is linked to a differential expression of cell wall biosynthesis genes, 2) incidence of drought events is increasing due to climate change, 3) irrigation is likely to be uneconomical during the cultivation of miscanthus and 4) miscanthus has many characteristics that make it a crop with a good potential for cultivation on marginal soils, where abiotic stresses such as drought may prevail. Drought stress was shown to result in a large reduction in cell wall and cellulose content and a substantial increase in hemicellulosic polysaccharides and cellulose conversion rates. We hypothesized that the reduction in cellulose content was due to an increase in the production of osmolytes, which are well-known for their role in plant protection against drought. The results indicated that drought stress had a positive effect on the cell wall degradability of miscanthus biomass. Overall the compendium of knowledge generated within the framework of this thesis provided insights into the variation in biomass quality properties in miscanthus, increased our understanding of the molecular, genetic and environmental factors influencing its conversion efficiency into biofuel and provided tools to exploit these factors to expand the use of miscanthus as a lignocellulose feedstock...|$|R
