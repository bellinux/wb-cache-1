Since blood is {{very sensitive to}} the presence of any foreign substances, testing for hemocompatibility is a major part of biocompatibility evaluation. At present, blood viscosity parameters are being used as screening tests for <b>biomaterial</b> <b>compatibility.</b> Successful use of these parameters will help eliminate many incompatible materials from being subjected to extensive testing. In this study, we evaluated the blood viscosity parameters (n = 10) -whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, red cell rigidity, hematocrit, and biochemical parameters (total proteins and albumin). A significant increase in hemorheological parameters after incubation with material was found to be an indicator of incompatibility...|$|E

Micropatterned surfaces have shown promise for reducing bioadhesion {{in a range of}} environments and represent a paradigm shift in methods for improving <b>biomaterial</b> <b>compatibility</b> [49 - 51]. Ordered pillar or well feature configurations have been the primary surface topography evaluated for platelet and bacterial control [30, 31, 52 - 58]. However, the Sharklet micropattern {{has been shown to be}} the most effective topography for bacterial control with one to three log reductions in microbial attachment across a range of species that cause hospital acquired infections (i.e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii) [32 - 34]. The true clinical effect of the Sharklet micropattern is the focus of future investigations based on the promising results of in vitro studies such as those presented here. The value of the micropattern approach is the potential to limit bacterial load below a clinically-relevant level without killing bacteria, so as to avoid the emergence of resistant strains of bacteria and difficult-to-treat infections.|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of <b>biomaterial</b> <b>compatibility</b> {{relies heavily on}} the analysis of macroscopic cellular responses to material interaction. However, new technologies have become available that permit a more profound understanding of the molecular basis of cell–biomaterial interaction. Here, both conventional phenotypic and contemporary transcriptomic (DNA microarray-based) analysis techniques were combined to examine the interaction of cells with a homologous series of copolymer films that subtly vary in terms of surface hydrophobicity. More specifically, we used differing combinations of N-isopropylacrylamide, which is presently used as an adaptive cell culture substrate, and the more hydrophobic, yet structurally similar, monomer N-tert-butylacrylamide. We show here that even discrete modifications {{with respect to the}} physiochemistry of soft amorphous materials can lead to significant impacts on the phenotype of interacting cells. Furthermore, we have elucidated putative links between phenotypic responses to cell–biomaterial interaction and global gene expression profile alterations. This case study indicates that high-throughput analysis of gene expression not only can greatly refine our knowledge of cell–biomaterial interaction, but also can yield novel biomarkers for potential use in biocompatibility assessment...|$|E

40|$|The {{biocompatibility}} of {{the bone}} implants is a crucial factor determining the successful tissue regeneration. The aim of this work was to compare cellular behavior and osteogenic properties of rat adipose-derived multipotent stromal cells (ASCs) and bone marrow multipotent stromal cells (BMSCs) cultured on metallic substrate covered with TiO 2 sol-gel-derived nanolayer. The morphology, proliferation rate, and osteogenic differentiation potential of both ASCs and BMSCs propagated on the biomaterials were examined. The potential for osteogenic differentiation of ASCs and BMSCs was determined based {{on the presence of}} specific markers of osteogenesis, that is, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteopontin (OPN), and osteocalcin (OCL). Additionally, the concentration of calcium and phosphorus in extracellular matrix was determined using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). Obtained results showed that TiO 2 layer influenced proliferation activity of ASCs, which manifested by shortening of population doubling time and increase of OPN secretion. However, characteristic features of cells morphology and growth pattern of cultures prompted us to conclude that ultrathin TiO 2 layer might also enhance osteodifferentiation of BMSCs. Therefore in our opinion, both populations of MSCs should be used for biological evaluation of <b>biomaterials</b> <b>compatibility,</b> such results may enhance the area of investigations related to regenerative medicine...|$|R
40|$|Autologous nerve grafts are {{the current}} gold {{standard}} for the repair of peripheral nerve injuries. However, {{there is a need}} to develop an alternative to this technique, as donor-site morbidities such as neuroma formation and permanent loss of function are a few of the limitations concerned with this technique. Artificial nerve conduits have therefore emerged as an alternative for the repair of short peripheral nerve defects of less than 30 mm, however they do not surpass autologous nerve grafts clinically. To develop a nerve conduit that supports regeneration over long nerve gaps and in large diameter nerves, researchers have focused on functionalizing of the conduits by studying the components that enhance nerve regeneration such as micro/nano-topography, growth factor delivery systems, supportive cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins as well as understanding the complex biological reactions that take place during peripheral nerve regeneration. This thesis presents strategies to improve peripheral nerve interfaces to better the regenerative potential by using dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) isolated from neonatal rats as an in vitro model of nerve regeneration. The work started off by investigating the usefulness of a frog foam protein Ranaspumin- 2 (Rsn 2) to coat <b>biomaterials</b> for <b>compatibility,</b> this lead to the discovery of temporary cell adhesion on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which was investigated as a suitable tool to derive cell-sheets for nerve repair. The influence of Rsn 2 anchored to specific adhesion peptide sequences, such as isoleucine-lysine-valine-alanine-valine (IKVAV), a sequence derived from laminin proven to promote cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth, was tested as a useful means to influence nerve regeneration. This approach improves the axonal outgrowth and maintains outgrowth long term. Based on the hypothesis that combinational modulation of substrate topography, stiffness and neurotrophic support, affects axonal outgrowth in whole DRGs, dissociated DRGs were used to assess if these factors similarly act at the single cell level. Rho associated protein kinase (ROCK) and myosin II inhibitors, which affect cytoskeletal contractility, were used to influence growth cone traction forces and have shown that these factors work in combination by interfering with growth cone dynamic creating a different response in axonal outgrowth at the single cell level...|$|R
40|$|A “one {{material}} fits all” mindset ignores profound {{differences in}} target tissues {{that affect their}} responses and reactivity. Yet {{little attention has been}} paid to the role of diseased tissue on material performance, biocompatibility, and healing capacity. We assessed material-tissue interactions with a prototypical adhesive material based on dendrimer/dextran and colon as a model tissue platform. Adhesive materials have high sensitivity to changes in their environment and can be exploited to probe and quantify the influence of even subtle modifications in tissue architecture and biology. We studied inflammatory colitis and colon cancer and found not only a difference in adhesion related to surface chemical interactions but also the existence of a complex interplay that determined the overall dendrimer/dextran <b>biomaterial</b> <b>compatibility.</b> Compatibility was contextual, not simply a constitutive property of the material, and was related to the extent and nature of immune cells in the diseased environment present before material implantation. We then showed how to use information about local alterations of the tissue microenvironment to assess disease severity. This in turn guided us to an optimal dendrimer/dextran formulation choice using a predictive model based on clinically relevant conditions. available in PMC 2015 October 30 National Institutes of Health (U.

40|$|Titanium (Ti) and its alloys {{are widely}} used in {{biomedical}} devices. As <b>biomaterials,</b> the blood <b>compatibility</b> of Ti and its alloys is important {{and needs to be}} further improved to provide better functionality. In this work, we studied the suitability of zirconia (ZrO 2) particle reinforced poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK) coatings on Ti 6 Al 4 V substrates for blood-contacting implants. The wettability, surface roughness and elastic modulus of the coatings were examined. Blood compatibility tests were conducted by erythrocytes observation, hemolysis assay and clotting time of recalcified human plasma, to find out correlations between the microstructure of the ZrO 2 -filled PEEK composite coatings and their blood compatibilities. The results suggested that adding ZrO 2 nanoparticles increased the surface roughness and improved the wettability and Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) elastic modulus of PEEK coating. The PEEK composite matrix coated Ti 6 Al 4 V specimens did not cause any aggregation of erythrocytes, showing morphological normal shapes. The hemolysis rate (HR) values of the tested specimens were much less than 5 % according to ISO 10993 - 4 standard. The values of plasma recalcification time (PRT) of the tested specimens varied with the increasing amount of ZrO 2 nanoparticles. Based on the results obtained, 10 wt % ZrO 2 particle reinforced PEEK coating has demonstrated an optimum blood compatibility, and can be considered as a candidate to improve the performance of existing PEEK based coatings on titanium substrates...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) {{printing}} {{provides an}} avenue for efficient, automatic, and repeatable fabrication of tissue engineering scaffolds with highly controlled architecture. Unlike other conventional processing methods, 3 D printing is dictated by a layer-by-layer assembly, allowing the fabrication of tunable and gradient architectures. 3 D printing is amenable to {{the incorporation of}} synthetic or natural materials, cells, and other molecules to mimic the physiological structure of native tissue. Additionally, complex geometries can be designed to accommodate patient-specific defects. This thesis investigates {{the development of an}} acellular 3 D printed scaffold presenting tunable gradients of pores and ceramic composites for bone tissue engineering and tumor modeling. In order to fabricate heterogeneous scaffolds, we have developed a platform to systematically optimize <b>biomaterial</b> formulations for <b>compatibility</b> with both open-source and commercial extrusion-based 3 D printing technologies. We have evaluated the internal geometry, porosity, mechanical properties, rheological properties, and biological properties of 3 D printed scaffolds using polymeric and ceramic biomaterials. Based on a large body of data, we have developed statistical models to predict internal scaffold geometry based on inputs of printing parameters and printing solution composition. The ability to predict scaffold architecture prior to printing saves processing time and material waste and would allow efficient customization of porosity, mechanical properties, and composite distribution of bone implants. This work {{has the potential to be}} applied to a wide variety of biomaterials and extrusion-based 3 D printing systems. Furthermore, we have investigated the use of gradient scaffolds for their relevance in mimicking the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment. We have employed computational modeling to predict the performance of 3 D printed gradient scaffolds with bone tumor cells under flow perfusion. A 3 D printed scaffold is first conceived by designing a computer-aided design (CAD) file. By leveraging the ideal architecture from the CAD file and non-invasive imaging techniques like micro-computed tomography (μCT), it is possible to understand and compare fluid dynamics computationally prior to running an experiment under flow perfusion. We were able to optimize the flow rate to model physiologically relevant levels of shear stress for the culture of tumor cells on 3 D pore gradient scaffolds in a flow perfusion bioreactor. In this work, we have demonstrated the versatility of combining biomaterials with extrusion-based printing for both tissue engineering and tumor modeling applications. We have leveraged the benefits of 3 D printing technologies and synthetic biomaterials to fabricate scaffolds with both controlled structural and compositional gradients...|$|R
