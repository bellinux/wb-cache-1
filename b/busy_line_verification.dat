5000|$|Operator {{assistance}} {{refers to}} a telephone call in which the calling party requires an operator to provide some form of assistance in completing the call. This may include telephone calls made from pay phones, calls placed station-to-station, person-to-person, collect, third number calls, calls billed to a credit card, and certain international calls which cannot be dialed directly. The telephone operator may {{also be able to}} assist with determining what kind of technical difficulties are occurring on a phone line, to verify whether a line is busy (<b>Busy</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Verification,</b> or BLV), or left off the hook, and break in on a phone line to request for the caller to clear the line for an incoming call (Busy Line Interruption, or BLI). The latter service is often utilized by emergency police. In addition, operators are often a first point of contact for the elderly wanting information on the current date and time.|$|E
30|$|Three {{different}} handshake modes {{handling the}} trigger/busy signals are available, {{one of them}} being the no-handshake mode, in which the TLU issues a fixed-length pulse on the trigger <b>line</b> with the <b>busy</b> <b>line</b> being disregarded. In simple handshake mode, the assertion of a trigger is replied by the integrated DAQ systems by asserting a signal on the <b>busy</b> <b>line.</b> The TLU then de-asserts the trigger and waits for the <b>busy</b> <b>line</b> going low. The trigger data handshake mode uses the same scheme as in the simple handshake mode, but additionally the current trigger data are transferred on the trigger line: after the trigger has been de-asserted, the trigger number is clocked out.|$|R
