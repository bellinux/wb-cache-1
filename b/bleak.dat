5|$|As he {{attempted}} to withdraw with the wounded soldier, <b>Bleak</b> was confronted by two more Chinese. Putting down the wounded soldier, <b>Bleak</b> reportedly surprised the Chinese soldiers by charging them and smashing their heads together {{with such force that}} he may have fractured the skulls of {{one or both of the}} assailants before pushing them out of his way. Eventually, all 20 men of the patrol returned to the UN lines, but a third of them were wounded. <b>Bleak</b> was credited with saving the patrol, both by promptly treating the wounded and by aggressively attacking and killing or neutralizing five Chinese soldiers.|$|E
5|$|As they {{attempted}} to continue up the hill, several Chinese soldiers from a nearby trench opened fire, injuring another soldier. According to witness reports, <b>Bleak</b> rushed the trench and dove into it, tackling one Chinese soldier and, with only his hands, broke the soldier's neck, killing him. <b>Bleak</b> was then confronted by a second soldier, whom he reportedly grabbed by the neck, fatally crushing his windpipe. A third Chinese soldier then approached, and in the ensuing scuffle, <b>Bleak</b> used his combat knife to stab and kill the soldier.|$|E

5|$|<b>Bleak</b> then {{returned}} to the patrol and attempted to treat more wounded members, but soon thereafter a Chinese hand grenade bounced off the helmet of the soldier standing next to him and landed nearby. <b>Bleak</b> tackled the soldier over and covered him with his larger frame to protect him from the grenade, but neither was injured in the ensuing blast. The patrol then continued on its mission, and was successful in capturing several Chinese prisoners. However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden in a trench with an automatic weapon. Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as <b>Bleak</b> attempted to run to them, he was hit in the leg. <b>Bleak</b> dressed all four wounds, but one of the men had been hit too critically to move. In spite of continued Chinese fire and his own injury, <b>Bleak</b> picked up the wounded soldier and began to carry him down the hill.|$|E

5|$|On 14 June 1952, <b>Bleak</b> {{was part}} of a patrol of the 2nd Battalion, 223rd Infantry, sent north to probe Chinese forward {{positions}} and attempt to obtain Chinese prisoners of war for interrogation. <b>Bleak</b> volunteered to accompany the 20-man patrol of an I Platoon on this mission, which was to send them to a sparsely vegetated feature called Hill 499, where Chinese forces were known to be operating. The patrol left United Nations lines at 04:30 Korea Standard Time on 14 June, under cover of darkness. It was preceded by an attack by F Company, 223rd Infantry, to the west which was intended to distract Chinese forces. However, as the patrol ascended the hill, it came under heavy Chinese automatic weapons fire which struck the lead elements, injuring several soldiers. <b>Bleak,</b> {{at the rear of the}} formation, rushed forward and treated and stabilized several soldiers hit in the initial volley, then followed the remainder of the patrol as it continued its mission.|$|E

His unit was assigned to a mountainous area near Minari-gol, South Korea, along the 38th Parallel. By that point in the war, the fronts had largely stabilized, and the duty in the area was characterized by constant, low-level trench warfare and continued battles over the same ground which produced high casualties. <b>Bleak</b> served as a field medic, assisting troops {{on the front lines}} instead of in Mobile Army Surgical Hospital units.|$|E
