5|$|The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished {{is a large}} painting, 399cm (13ft 1in) across. It {{depicts a}} {{defeated}} soldier, kneeling in front of another soldier. The defeated fighter strains to free himself from {{the grip of the}} victorious warrior, who stands, raising a sword. A kneeling woman clutches the waist of the victorious soldier, raising her face to him to beg him to spare his defeated foe. The defeated warrior has a stronger body, a face more in keeping with the conventions of attractiveness at the time, and a more sympathetic expression, while the victorious man is darker skinned and has an expression of blank fierceness. The vanquished soldier's sword has broken, and lies <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the ground.|$|E
25|$|Garrick was {{the first}} actor to be granted the honour of being buried in Westminster Abbey, in Poets' Corner next to the {{monument}} to William Shakespeare. Later Henry Irving, the first actor to be knighted, was buried <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the same spot. Laurence Olivier was the third to be given that honour, in 1989.|$|E
25|$|Morrissey's 2012 tour {{started in}} South America and {{continued}} through Asia and North America. Morrissey played concerts in Belgium, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Israel, Portugal, England, and Scotland. In late September, while visiting Strand Bookstore in Manhattan, he saved an elderly lady who had fainted <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> <b>On</b> 12 November 2012, Morrissey {{announced that he}} would be continuing his North American tour adding 32 cities beginning in Greenvale, New York on 9 January and ending in Portland, Oregon on 8 March. Patti Smith and her band were special guests at the Staples Center concert in Los Angeles, and Kristeen Young opened on all nights.|$|E
6000|$|... "This way," [...] {{cried the}} boy, and, without waiting {{to know that}} I had heard him, he dashed off at breakneck speed, further into {{the bowels of the}} temple. As fast as he went, however, I was still <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> urging <b>him</b> <b>on</b> to greater speed.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is lovely, is it not?" [...] {{he exclaimed}} to Amuba, who was {{standing}} <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> leaning <b>on</b> his bow and looking over the water.|$|R
60|$|She {{sighed and}} walked dizzily <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> They went <b>on</b> in silence.|$|R
500|$|When the five-year-old Pedro awoke on 7 April 1831, <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the bed lay his father's {{imperial}} crown. Pedro I and {{his wife}} had already left Brazilian soil and boarded the British frigate Warspite. Pedro II wrote a letter of farewell to his father aided by Mariana de Verna. On receipt of this, a tearful Pedro I composed a reply, calling the little boy [...] "My beloved son, and my Emperor." [...] His father and stepmother remained on board the Warspite another five days before leaving for Europe, but they did not see the young emperor during that period … or ever again. For the remainder of his life, Pedro I would become distressed upon his children's absences and fretted about their futures. Pedro II missed his father and stepmother (who had assumed his mother's role), and this may account for his later lack of any emotional display in public. In fact, the [...] "sudden loss of his family was to haunt Pedro II throughout his life". Three of his sisters stayed behind in Brazil with Pedro II: Januária, Paula and Francisca.|$|E
500|$|Æthelbald's {{rebellion}} {{was supported}} by Ealhstan, Bishop of Sherborne, and Eanwulf, ealdorman of Somerset, even though {{they appear to have}} been two of the king's most trusted advisers. According to Asser, the plot was concerted [...] "in the western part of Selwood", and western nobles may have backed Æthelbald because they resented the patronage Æthelwulf gave to eastern Wessex. Asser also stated that Æthelwulf agreed to give up the western part of his kingdom in order to avoid a civil war. Some historians such as Keynes and Abels think that his rule was then confined to the south-east, while others such as Kirby think {{it is more likely that}} it was Wessex itself which was divided, with Æthelbald keeping Wessex west of Selwood, Æthelwulf holding the centre and east, and Æthelberht keeping the south-east. Æthelwulf insisted that Judith should sit <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the throne until the end of his life, and according to Asser this was [...] "without any disagreement or dissatisfaction on the part of his nobles".|$|E
2500|$|Each of {{the four}} Evangelists is {{identified}} by his [...] "attribute", carved <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> his plinth and bearing a red sash with the saint’s name on it written in rustic capitals: a winged man, a winged lion, a winged ox and an eagle represent Matthew, Mark, Luke and John respectively. There is a nimbus behind the head of each saint. The saint’s niches are painted dark blue/green with a cinquefoil, gold edged, highlighted with red in the spandrels.|$|E
6000|$|Similarly on {{this same}} head, the Uncommercial {{underwent}} discomfiture from a Wiltshire labourer: a simple, fresh-coloured farm-labourer, of eight-and-thirty, who {{at one time}} stood <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> looking <b>on</b> at new arrivals, and with whom he held this dialogue: ...|$|R
60|$|So {{they went}} downstairs, and found Mary making tea; and Margaret, fearing Dr. Spencer was {{overwhelmed}} with his young admirers--for Aubrey and Gertrude were {{one on each}} knee, and Blanche standing <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> inflicting <b>on</b> <b>him</b> a catalogue of the names and ages of all the eleven.|$|R
60|$|At {{once the}} cabin door was unbarred and flung back. All crowded forward, to behold Uriah Risley outside, <b>on</b> horseback. <b>Beside</b> <b>him,</b> also <b>on</b> horseback, was his wife, pale and thin, a mere shadow {{of her former}} self, but still able to ride alone.|$|R
2500|$|Taking {{control of}} the ship, the Major then reveals to Batou {{the truth about the}} gynoids. Hiring the Yakuza to traffick young girls, LOCUS SOLUS {{duplicated}} their consciousnesses into the gynoids, giving them human [...] "ghosts" [...] to make them more realistic. Batou rescues a young girl from a [...] "ghost dubbing" [...] machine, and she explains that Jack Walkson, learning the truth about LOCUS SOLUS, promised to save the girls by tampering with the ghosting process; this caused the gynoids to murder their owners, allowing Walkson to attract police attention and indirectly kill the Yakuza boss. Despite Walkson's actions saving the girls, Batou objects that he also victimized the gynoids as well, causing them severe distress by giving them damaged ghosts. Having solved the case, Batou asks the Major if she's happy now, and she notes that she'll always be <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the network, before disconnecting from the gynoid.|$|E
2500|$|The {{family members}} all played music. [...] Mr. Scruggs had played an open back banjo using the frailing technique, though {{as an adult}} Earl had no {{recollection}} of his father's playing. Mrs. Scruggs played the pump organ. Earl's siblings, older brothers Junie and Horace, and older sisters Eula Mae and Ruby, all played banjo and guitar. Scruggs recalls a visit to his uncle's home at age six to hear a blind banjo player named Mack Woolbright, who played a finger picking style and had recorded for Columbia Records. This made an impression on Scruggs, who said, [...] "He'd sit in the rocking chair, and he'd pick some {{and it was just}} amazing. I couldn't imagine — he was the first, what I call a good banjo player." [...] Scruggs then took up the instrument — he was too small to hold it at first and improvised by setting his brother Junie's banjo <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the floor. He moved it around depending on what part of the neck he was playing. [...] After his father's death, Scruggs seemed to take solace in playing music, and when not in school or doing farm chores, spent nearly every spare moment he had practicing. His first radio performance was at age 11 on a talent scout show.|$|E
2500|$|McCreight {{became friends}} with many Native Americans and Chief Wa-na-ta (Waanatan II) visited McCreight’s office {{regularly}} to smoke tobacco. [...] McCreight {{was impressed with the}} old chief’s dignity and bearing. “One day he signed that he wished a private interview, when he drew from his blanket a package which he exhibited as something he held more precious than any other treasure. [...] It was carefully wrapped in old newspaper, and after it had been divested of the strings and unrolled to be read, it proved to be the parchment or treaty with Government officials, his own name inscribed as head or Grand Chief. [...] Having thus established his old-day tribal office, he carefully refolded the document, wrapped it in the faded news sheet and returned it to the inner folds of his blanket, then nimbly squatted on the office floor, filled his pipe and enjoyed his usual half-hour smoke.” Chief Wa-na-ta’s smoking pipe was his most precious possession. “A titled English ranch-owner who knew of his importance in history offered any price that the old chief would name for the pipe and pouch, but the chief disdained to listen to any offer of money. [...] But when I squatted <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the floor, where he was puffing meditatively on his long red-stone pipe, to tell him of leaving next week for a trip west, he arose instantly, untied his belt, laid both pouch and pipe across his left hand and extended it to me as a present and token to be preserved after he had passed to the long sleep.” [...] McCreight forever remembered the kindness and generosity of Chief Wa-na-ta.|$|E
60|$|So {{they went}} out, all of them, except he {{who had the}} horses, and Hugh called aloud that the first man of the Claverings who lifted a bow or drew a sword should die without mercy. And he pointed to Grey Dick, who stood <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> arrow <b>on</b> string.|$|R
60|$|I {{went out}} and {{procured}} the easiest coach I could find, and inside of it we placed Mr. Stillwell, with the physician <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> and Gus <b>on</b> the seat with the driver.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{goes well}} so far," [...] she thought, {{as she watched}} their {{approach}} with a smile; for Sancho sat bolt upright in the chair which Ben pushed, while Thorny strolled <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> leaning <b>on</b> a stout cane newly cut. Both boys were talking busily, and Thorny laughed from time to time, as if his comrade's chat was very amusing.|$|R
60|$|Bianca, placing herself <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> her knees, {{pressed her}} hot cheek against his temple.|$|E
60|$|Ruth nestled down <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> her knees, and {{clasped her}} arms about his neck.|$|E
60|$|Sherlock Holmes {{sat down}} <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> {{the couch and}} patted him kindly on the shoulder.|$|E
60|$|On the {{following}} morning there {{was something of a}} surprise. About eleven o'clock, while some of the lads were fishing, and Dave had Jessie out in a canoe, there came a shout from up the brook, and looking in that direction our hero saw Phil approaching, with his uncle <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> leaning <b>on</b> the youth's shoulder.|$|R
50|$|Bram van Velde died on 28 December 1981 in Grimaud (near Arles), and {{is buried}} there. His mentor and friend Jacques Putman, who {{supported}} {{him and his}} career after Bram's departure from Maeght, is buried <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> (Putman died <b>on</b> 27 February 1994 in Paris).|$|R
60|$|And <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> one <b>on</b> {{each side}} of him, there stood the deastralized forms of Yahi-Bahi and Ram Spudd. They wore long overcoats, doubtless the {{contents}} of the magic parcels, and the Philippine chauffeur had a grip of iron on the neck of each as they stood. Mr. Spudd had lost his Oriental hair, and the face of Mr. Yahi-Bahi, perhaps in the struggle which had taken place, had been scraped white in patches.|$|R
60|$|The squire {{dropped down}} <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> {{his knees and}} kissed his hand, crying like a child.|$|E
60|$|I stood <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> {{the river}} bank, {{and as we}} talked the handle of my parasol touched the bottom button of his waistcoat.|$|E
60|$|<b>Beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> {{the march}} rode the fierce red giant, Shandy, and the wiry, gray little man of Torn, whom the outlaw called father.|$|E
60|$|He descended, and {{assisted}} her to mount <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> and drove <b>on</b> again, almost in silence. He {{was inclined to}} believe that some supernatural legerdemain {{had to do with}} these periodic impacts of Picotee on his path. She sat mute and melancholy till they were within half-a-mile of Corvsgate.|$|R
60|$|The heron {{was gone}} two hundred yards, running, {{in spite of}} his pole, at a {{wonderful}} pace, before a bow could be brought to bear. He seemed to expect an arrow; for he stopped, glanced his eye round, threw himself flat on his face, with his shield, not over his body, but over his bare legs; sprang up as the shaft stuck in the ground <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> ran <b>on,</b> planted his pole in the next dike, and flew over it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There! that's the way. One--two--three, one--two--three.' Round {{and round}} went Prince and Madeline in an interminable waltz. The table and stools had been shoved over {{against the wall}} to {{increase}} the room. Malemute Kid sat on the bunk, chin to knees, greatly interested. Jack Harrington sat <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> scraping away <b>on</b> his violin and following the dancers.|$|R
60|$|He {{took her}} hand in his and made her sit <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the rude stone that served as the old {{doorstep}} of the cabin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Would {{that you}} had been with us," [...] said Ambrose, sitting down <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the step. [...] "Never have I heard such words as to-day." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, {{notwithstanding}} what Jimmy {{had just}} told him, there presently {{came up to}} my comrade an old woman, who seated herself <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the canoe.|$|E
6000|$|... "On this {{occasion}} it was Mr. Austin," [...] said Jacinta, who {{found a place}} opposite <b>him,</b> <b>beside</b> Muriel, <b>on</b> a settee. [...] "Of course, that was because he is going away. Isn't he here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{propose to}} try," [...] said Will, {{as he turned}} away. As be did so, he {{caught a glimpse of}} Ed Kinney at the well, pumping a pail of water for Agnes, who stood <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> the sun <b>on</b> her {{beautiful}} yellow hair. She was laughing at something Ed was saying as he slowly moved the handle up and down.|$|R
50|$|St. Cecilia's companions are {{identified}} {{in part by}} their attributes. Immediately to her right, John the Evangelist has an eagle, his usual symbol, peeking out around his robes. <b>Beside</b> <b>him,</b> Paul leans <b>on</b> the sword with which {{he had come to}} be identified in medieval art. Augustine of Hippo holds his crosier. Mary Magdalene holds the alabaster jar by which she is most commonly identified.|$|R
