5|$|A fifth-place {{finish in}} the Premier League in 2004–05 meant Liverpool were not {{guaranteed}} entry into the Champions League, and faced the prospect {{of not being able}} to defend their European title. UEFA eventually ruled that they would <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, but would be required to start in the first qualifying round, with no country protection, meaning they could face a team from England in the group stages. This turned out to be the case—Liverpool advanced through three qualifying rounds and were drawn with Chelsea in the group stages. They progressed from their group as winners but were beaten by Benfica in the first knock-out round.|$|E
5|$|As the {{cover-up}} begins, a copy-cat killing occurs, but McNulty quickly identifies and arrests the culprit. Pearlman tells McNulty and Freamon {{that they can}} no longer <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> investigative work and warns of criminal charges if the scandal becomes public. They opt to retire. Haynes attempts to expose Templeton but the managing editors ignore the fabrications and demote anyone critical of their star reporter. Carcetti pressures Daniels to falsify crime statistics to aid his campaign. Daniels refuses and then quietly resigns rather than have his FBI file leaked.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Chia mooted {{the idea}} that Singaporeans {{should be able to}} borrow from their own Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings to tide over periods of {{financial}} difficulty. His rationale was that if individuals could borrow from their own CPF accounts to buy depreciating property and money-losing stocks, there was no reason why they should not <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so to pay for bills. Dr. Ong Seh Hong, MP for Aljunied GRC, opposed the view, stating that it was important and for the good of Singapore that Singaporeans were independent individuals who could assume the risks and successes of their investments and be self-sufficient.|$|E

25|$|During the task, Saira and Paul were {{involved}} in another heated argument between themselves, with James initially trying to stop it, before he and Raj decided to leave them alone until it was finished. During the argument Saira threatened to fire Paul, who refused to accept that she <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, though she never carried through on her threat, making it unknown if she would have <b>been</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|R
5|$|The 2004–05 {{season was}} a {{disappointment}} in the league as Liverpool finished in fifth place outside the UEFA Champions League qualification places. They were eliminated from the FA Cup third round by Burnley. The club reached {{the final of the}} League Cup, but lost 3–2 to Chelsea. Liverpool also reached the final of the UEFA Champions League and it appeared the club would lose their second final of the season when they were 3–0 down to Italian team Milan at half-time, but three goals in six minutes allowed Liverpool to draw level at 3–3. No goals in extra time meant the match went to a penalty shoot-out, which they won 3–2. A fifth-place finish in the Premier League meant Liverpool were not guaranteed entry into the Champions League and faced the prospect {{of not being able to}} defend their European title. UEFA eventually ruled that they would <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, but would be required to start in the first qualifying round. They were eliminated in the first knockout round by Portuguese team Benfica. In the 2005–06 season they finished in third place. They also reached the 2006 FA Cup Final where they faced West Ham United. Liverpool won 3–1 in a penalty shoot-out after the match finished 3–3.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day that Bliss resigned, the school's investigative {{committee}} announced their preliminary results and imposed preliminary sanctions on the basketball program. Initial sanctions imposed by the school included two years' probation, no postseason play for the 2003–2004 season – including the Big 12 Conference tournament, and any player in the men's basketball program who wished to transfer would <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E

Near the end of the show, Cleese presents the Silly Walk, rendered on radio as a series of loud, slow footsteps.|$|E
25|$|In March 1987, the Soviet {{delegation}} to the UN walked out when Littman arranged for Natan Sharansky {{to speak to the}} Commission about refuseniks. Also in 1987, he accused the Soviet delegate of antisemitism when he appeared before the UN Commission on Human Rights. In 1988 he requested that several Jews in the USSR who were refused permission to emigrate should <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. He repeated the request to Boris Yeltsin in 1991. In August 1989, he appeared before the Commission representing WUPJ.|$|E
25|$|A {{party to}} a {{proceeding}} {{should have the}} right to access documentation which had been produced by the other party to the proceedings. It would be wrong if such documents were not shown to the other party at all.

However, as the High Court opined in Teng Cheng Sin v. Law Fay Yuen (2003), if a party does not request for copies of documents or for time to study the documents, a complaint of this nature will carry much less weight.|$|E

25|$|Capt. Teruzō Andō led 200 {{men of the}} 3rd Infantry Regiment to Suzuki's private {{residence}} just across from the Imperial Palace in Kōjimachi. They surrounded and disarmed the police on guard, then a group entered the building. After Suzuki was discovered in his bedroom, he was shot twice (sources differ as to who fired the shots). Andō then moved to deliver a coup de grace with his sword, when Suzuki's wife pleaded to <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it herself. Believing Suzuki to be mortally wounded, Andō agreed. He apologized to her, explaining that it was done {{for the sake of}} the nation. He then ordered his men to salute Suzuki and they left to guard the Miyakezaka junction north of the Ministry of War. Suzuki, although seriously wounded, would survive.|$|E
25|$|In spring 531, as news arrived {{of another}} Persian invasion, Hermogenes was sent {{again to the}} East {{at the head of}} {{reinforcements}} for Belisarius's army. He joined Belisarius, who had been following the Persians, at Barbalissus. There, Hermogenes mediated and resolved a dispute between Belisarius and one of his subordinate commanders, Sunicas. At this point the Persians, confronted by the Byzantine army, decided to withdraw. Hermogenes agreed with Belisarius's opinion that, their invasion having failed, they should <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, but his subordinate commanders advocated battle. The two armies met near Callinicum, but the ensuing battle resulted in a heavy Byzantine defeat. In the aftermath of the battle, Hermogenes visited Kavadh as an envoy, but failed to achieve any results. He returned to Constantinople, from where he was again sent as an envoy in late summer of 531. There, he attached himself to the army of Sittas, and was with Sittas when he relieved the city of Martyropolis from a Persian siege.|$|E

Only one of these counts was retried, and once again a guilty verdict was returned. In 2001 he was eligible for day leave, and he gained media attention by leaving the decision {{as to whether or not}} he should <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so up to the readers of the Herald Sun.

500|$|The {{danger is}} perhaps not great if the people of one State, through their legislature, decide that Lady Chatterley's Lover goes so far beyond the {{acceptable}} standards of candor {{that it will be}} deemed offensive and non-sellable, for the State next door is still free to make its own choice. At least we do not have one uniform standard. But the dangers to free thought and expression are truly great if the Federal Government imposes a blanket ban over the Nation on such a book. [...] The fact that the people of one State cannot read some of the works of D. H. Lawrence seems to me, if not wise or desirable, at least acceptable.
