40|$|Abstract. The ultra-fine denier PET full drawing yarn (PET-FDY) with {{monofilament}} {{linear density}} equal to 0. 38 dTex was produced. During the practical process of ultrafine denier PET-FDY, the yarn should be heat-set at certain temperature following the drawing process {{in order to}} improve the mechanical properties and reduce the <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> The influence of heat-setting temperature on the structure and performance of ultra-fine denier PET FDY was studied in this paper. With heat-setting temperature increasing, crystalline in PET FDY became perfect and crystallite size became bigger. According to the density method, crystallinity was augmented. Crystal orientation factor and overall orientation factor were both increased. The tenacity and tensile stress at 10 % strain of PET FDY were increased and the breakage percentage and <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>shrinkage</b> were reduced with the heat-setting temperature increasing...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{structure}} and properties of fibers pre-pared from copolymers of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) in which 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -propanediol (MPDiolGlycol {{is a registered}} trademark of Lyondell Chemical Company) at 4, 7, 10, and 25 mol % was substituted for ethylene glycol were studied and {{compared with those of}} PET homopolymer. Filaments were melt spun over a range of spinning condi-tions, and some filaments that were spun at relatively low spinning speeds were subjected to hot drawing. The fila-ments were characterized by measurements of birefrin-gence, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) crystallinity, melting point, glass transition temperature, wide-angle X-ray diffraction patterns, <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> tenacity, and elongation to break.

40|$|The {{strength}} of wet-spun poly(vinyl alcohol) (pva) fibres is given as function of bath-stretching, wet-stretching and hot-stretching. In the two equations derived for {{strength of}} wet-stretching and hot-stretching the complex {{influence of the}} bath-stretching and hot-stretching is demonstrated. The bath-stretching is connected with a pure orientation effect and the residence time in the coagulating bath which is a measure for the ‘freshness’ of the fibre. The hot-stretching can be separated in a pure orientation effect and a crystallization effect. Fibres of the pva, used in the experiments, were soluble in <b>boiling</b> <b>water.</b> After <b>shrinkage</b> of the fibres at temperatures near the temperature of hot-stretching, the dissolution temperature can be raised. Insoluble pva fibres were prepared after removing most of the bulky residual ester groups...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the suitability of <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> test in the prediction of seed viability in leek seed and to compare this test with standard germination and vigour test. Basic principle of <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> test is the evaluation of radicle protrusion from the seeds immersed to <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> for certain time. The viability of aged and unaged leek seeds in <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> test was correlated with standard germination and vigour test. In this research. the mean germination of unaged leek seeds varied from 29, 639 % to 70, 18 % depending on the cultivars. While the range of <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> test in unaged leek seeds was between 35. 57 % to 51, 06 %, the range for emergence was between 27, 63 % to 72, 05 %. The viability of aged and unaged leek seeds in <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> test was correlated with standard germination test. According to the results of this research, it might be assessed that <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> test is a rapid and simple method to measure seed viability by evaluating radicle protrusion of leek seeds in <b>boiling</b> <b>water.</b> In conclusion. <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> test as a new viability test for leek seed {{could be used as a}} rapid method for determining the viability in leek seeds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:-Mechanical crimp texturising {{method was}} {{developed}} with {{the virtue of}} imparting economy and versatility to the texturising process. Yarn produced by this technique has executed closer resemblance to preferable ring spun yarn structure as well as properties to flat multifilament yarn. Commercial success of this concept demands through study of impact of various raw materials, machine variables and process variables {{on the performance of}} this innovative yarn. This research work thereby designed to identify the influence of raw material variables on the mechanical crimp textured yarn performance. However, in order to avoid undue overlapping machine variables as well as process variables were kept constant. Empirically optimised values of these variables for polyester yarn have been adopted for this study. Fully drawn multifilament yarns belonging to two most commercially popular groups viz; Polyester and Nylon, were textured at three different false twist levels. These yarns were not only differing in terms of type of polymer group but also in terms of other contributing properties, viz; yarn fineness, filament fineness, cross sectional shape etc [...] However values of these variables were purely restricted by the availability of variations from the manufacturer end. Comparative evaluation of texturising as well mechanical properties of these product yarns have been done. All the samples irrespective of the material have shown the rise in the percent bulk, linear density, percent extension, percent <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>shrinkage</b> with finer trilobal cross section filament yarn. However, at identical yarn fineness, number of filaments (dpf) has played a detrimental role than modulus of polymeric yarn...|$|E

Chromatograms of <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> extract of F 2 and F 3 are shown in Figure  2 d,e, respectively. In addition, HPLC chromatogram of 60 % ethanol showed more peaks (data not shown) indicating presence of other chemical constituents in the herbal recipe. We found similar HPLC chromatogram patterns between <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> and ambient temperature water extracts, but the different pattern was only between the retention times from 35 to 43  min.

Thus, in this study, <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> was the most appropriate solvent for extraction of barakol and other chemical constituents from herbal recipes.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{efficacy}} of three ASTM saturation techniques for measuring the water absorption of concrete.

The vacuum saturation was more effective than the cold <b>water</b> and <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> saturation methods. The vacuum saturation technique produced up to 13. 1 more water absorption than the <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> saturation method and up to 20. 2 more water absorption than the cold water saturation method.
