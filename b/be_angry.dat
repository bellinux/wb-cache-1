5|$|The French were {{initially}} opposed to Albani's election, but they quickly dropped {{their opposition to}} him. He was elected unanimously on 23 November 1700. He was unsure whether he should accept the papacy {{due to the fact}} that he had nephews who he suspected would <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> if he followed the bull on nepotism. He was eventually convinced to accept the papacy by theologians who told him that not accepting an unanimous election would not be following the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{budget was}} so small that during the 32 days of {{shooting}} in Eugene, mostly in November, Landis had no trailer or office and could not watch dailies for three weeks. His wife Deborah Nadoolman purchased most of the costumes at local thrift stores, and she and Judy Belushi made the party togas. Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene for reporters visiting the set where the director pretended to <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> at the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis grabbed a breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill's head. He {{fell to the ground}} and pretended to be unconscious. The reporters were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill to get up, he refused to move.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, the Liberal {{strategy}} {{had been}} to polarize the electorate between Mike Harris and Dalton McGuinty. They purposely put out a platform that was devoid of ideas, to ensure the election was about the Tory record, and not the Liberal agenda. To an extent, they succeeded. Support for the NDP collapsed from 21% to just 13%, while the Liberals climbed 9%. However, while they almost cornered the market of those angry at the Tories, they could not convince enough people to <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> at the Tories to win.|$|E

In his statement to police after his arrest, Dahmer stated that after giving Thomas a drink laden with sedatives, he did not feel attracted to him, but was afraid to allow him to awake in case he would <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> over having been drugged. Therefore, he strangled him and dismembered the body—intentionally retaining no body parts whatsoever. Nonetheless, he did photograph the dismemberment process and retained these photographs, which would aid in Thomas' subsequent identification.|$|E

Pang Tong gives fake advice to Cao Cao by suggesting that he uses metal chains to link his warships together to reduce the chances of his troops falling seasick.

After he made Li Deyu chancellor in 833, Li Deyu used Emperor Wenzong's dislike for these officials to begin ejecting Niu Faction officials from the government. Li Zongmin responded by having Zheng Tan, who was then imperial scholar, removed from his post as imperial scholar—but Emperor Wenzong reacted by promoting Zheng to be the chief imperial censor without consulting Li Zongmin, which caused Li Zongmin to <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> and fearful. Soon thereafter, Li Zongmin himself was sent out to Shannan West Circuit (山南西道, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), to serve as its military governor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Some {{propose that}} the {{question}} of how you know that James <b>is</b> <b>angry</b> can <b>be</b> adequately answered with the claim that you see that James <b>is</b> <b>angry.</b> Call this the Perceptual Hypothesis. Here, I examine that hypothesis. I argue that there are two different ways in which the Perceptual Hypothesis could be made true. You might see that James <b>is</b> <b>angry</b> by seeing his bodily features. Alternatively, you might see that James <b>is</b> <b>angry</b> by seeing his anger. If you see that James <b>is</b> <b>angry</b> in the first way, your knowledge is inferential. If you see that James <b>is</b> <b>angry</b> in the second way, your knowledge is not inferential. These are different ways of knowing that James <b>is</b> <b>angry.</b> So the Perceptual Hypothesis alone does not adequately answer the question of how you know that fact. To ascertain how you know it, we need {{to decide whether or not}} you saw his anger. This is an epistemological argument. But it has consequences for a theory of perception. It implies that there is a determinate fact about which features of an object you see. This fact is made true independently of what you come to know by seeing. In the final section of the paper, I seek to undermine various ways in which the claim that you see James' anger may be thought implausibl...|$|R
25|$|Pat disowned his {{entertainer}} father, Simon Reynolds, {{when the}} latter {{came out as}} a homosexual. Simon has made efforts to reconcile with his son, which Pat has disgustedly repulsed. The entire topic of his father is off limits to Pat, suggesting repression issues. The comic has hinted at this complexity of his character for some time. In 2006, his own latent homosexuality was forced {{out into the open}} by the magical Mexican realism camera. Apparently both Pat and his father magically became homosexual due to the curse of Gladdington castle, wherein an ancestor of theirs was cursed such that all of his sons and their sons thereafter would become homosexual at the age of 26. Pat has since become much more comfortable about his homosexuality, using perceived persecution as just another reason to <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> at the world, and has been dating Rod Huggins, a gay porn star.|$|E
25|$|After an {{argument}} between Mercy and Fatboy, she pushes {{him and he}} falls onto a tree planted in memory of Trina Johnson (Sharon Duncan Brewster), breaking it. Worried that Trina's ex-husband Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet) will <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> with them, they enlist Leon and Zsa Zsa's help to replace the tree. However, as they dig up the tree, they discover the body of Owen Turner (Lee Ross) buried beneath it. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy when she says it is all she can see when she closes her eyes. She attends Lucas's Bible class and questions him about false prophets and a passage that states that anyone who questions a priest should be put to death, causing Lucas to make an excuse to leave because he cannot answer her. Grace asks Mercy {{to write a letter}} of apology to Lucas, but Mercy throws it away. Mercy and Fatboy play rounders but smash Dot Branning's (June Brown) window, which Fatboy repairs. Mercy asks Dot if she can attend her church. When Zsa Zsa is left homeless, she asks to move in with Mercy and her grandmother.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{anger in}} {{infidelity}} is quite inevitable. In the initial stage of infidelity anger {{is not as}} apparent as it is seen in stage two, because there is not hard facts or evidence supporting one’s suspicions. Like previously talked about the accuser most likely feels jealous and incompetent {{in the first stage}} of cheating. These emotions can contract into anger and provide a cognitive state of anger, because the accusing person anticipates his or her anger. Unlike jealousy and resentment, it is hard to identify the purpose or cause of the individual’s anger because in reality there is nothing yet to <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> about, there is no proof of their romantic partner’s unfaithfulness. 25% of people surveyed felt angry in the beginning or suspicion stage of infidelity (Johnson, 2017). It is hard to pinpoint the anger emotion in the initial stages due to ambiguity; therefore, it begins to take on other emotions turning into a cognitive state of emotional turmoil. The individual knows they are angry and anticipates it, but cannot logically explain it to their partner {{because of the lack of}} evidence they have.|$|E

25|$|It {{is clear}} to Lizaveta Prokofyevna and General Yepanchin that their {{daughter}} {{is in love with}} the Prince, but Aglaya denies this and angrily dismisses talk of marriage. She continues to mock and reproach him, often in front of others, and lets slip that, as far as she is concerned, the problem of Nastassya Filippovna is yet to be resolved. Myshkin himself merely experiences an uncomplicated joy in her presence and is mortified when she appears to <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> with him. Lizaveta Prokofyevna feels it is time to introduce the Prince to their aristocratic circle and a dinner party is arranged for this purpose, to be attended by a number of eminent and influential persons. Aglaya, who does not share her parents' respect for these people and is afraid that Myshkin's eccentricity will not meet with their approval, tries to tell him how to behave, but ends by sarcastically telling him to be as eccentric as he likes, and to be sure to wave his arms about when he is pontificating on some high-minded subject and break her mother's priceless Chinese vase. Feeling her anxiety, Myshkin too becomes extremely anxious, but he tells her that it is nothing compared to the joy he feels in her company. He tries to approach the subject of Nastasya Filippovna again, but she silences him and hurriedly leaves.|$|E
25|$|Śrībhārgavamithilāgamanam (Sanskrit: श्रीभार्गवमिथिलागमनम्) In {{only her}} sixth year, Sītā's {{appearance}} {{is like that}} of a sixteen-year-old. Her beauty is described by the poet in 12 verses (13.9–13.20). Janaka realizes that his daughter is the Ādi Śakti of Rāma and no ordinary girl, as she can drag the onerous bow of Śiva as a child. He is concerned about Sītā getting a deserving husband. He thinks about the doctrine of Avatāra, having heard verses about it in the Vedas, but his intellect and rationalism make him not believe it. After much contemplation, he concludes that the doctrine must be true. Just then, a doorkeeper announces the arrival of Paraśurāma in Mithilā. Janaka bows down to Paraśurāma. Knowing Janaka to be a noble king, Paraśurāma does not consider him to be his enemy, unlike the despotic Kṣatriyas. Paraśurāma expresses his wish to see Sītā. Janaka leads him to the sacrificial assembly (Yajñaśālā), where Paraśurāma sees Sītā playing with the bow of Śiva by dragging it like a play-horse. Paraśurāma asks Janaka to hold a Svayaṃvara for Sītā in which the prince who breaks the bow of Śiva will have the right to marry Sītā. Paraśurāma further predicts that Rāma, the descendant of Raghu, will break the bow. Paraśurāma tells Janaka that he will arrive again in Mithilā, pretending to <b>be</b> <b>angry,</b> so that he can have an excuse of seeing both Sītā and Rāma. At the end of the canto Paraśurāma bows to the child Sītā and starts to praise her.|$|E
25|$|Jane was {{appointed}} as a {{lady of the}} Queen's bedchamber on 15 July 1851. Although hard-working, loyal and devoted, she lacked the knowledge and discretion required for the role. In 1855, Mary Bulteel, later {{the wife of the}} Queen's private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby, disapproved of Jane's conduct, and commented that “Lady E. is more utterly the reverse from what she ought to be on this occasion than anybody can possibly conceive. I mean, I see she is preparing to be foolishly cringing to all the little miseries of etiquette...I quite long for somebody as the Queen's first lady with more natural dignity”. Despite her shortcomings, the Queen came to rely heavily on “Dearest Jane”, as she was referred to. The Queen required the utmost effort and devotion from her servants, and Jane followed this code of conduct with total deference to her royal mistress. However, her health suffered as a result, and it remained a constant burden throughout her waiting. In a letter from Henry Ponsonby to Sir Thomas Biddulph, another courtier, he reported that Jane “was principally taken up with her own health”. Jane was also concerned about her own health, and in 1876, she confided to Ponsonby that “she cannot go on as it is, that it is killing her”, and he advised her to write to the Queen threatening to resign if her position was not made easier. The Queen relented, but continued to impose restrictions on Jane's contact with the outside world. Jane's son, who became the 4th Marquess on {{the death of his father}} in 1857, was anxious to visit, but the Queen would not allow him to. Instead, he requested an interview with Ponsonby about his mother's arduous duties; Ponsonby accepted, but Jane said “oh no, perhaps the Queen would not like it”. Ponsonby referred to this fear of the Queen as absurd, knowing that the Queen would not <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> with him for paying a visit to Jane's son.|$|E

Studies 1 – 3 revealed that people believe atheists <b>are</b> <b>angrier</b> than believers, people in general, and other minority groups, both explicitly and implicitly. Studies 4 – 7 then examined the accuracy of these beliefs. Belief in God, state anger, and trait anger were assessed in multiple ways and contexts.
