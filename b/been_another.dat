5|$|Ticinum {{eventually}} {{fell to the}} Lombards {{in either}} May or June 572. Alboin had in the meantime chosen Verona as his seat, establishing himself and his treasure in a royal palace built there by Theodoric.

5|$|August 15, 1787: The Four-State Tornado Swarm of 1787 was {{the largest}} tornado {{outbreak}} recorded to date, and affected most of New England. The first in the state touched down around 1:30PM near New Britain, traveling along nearly the same path as a tornado in 1728 or 1729. This tornado was nearly as violent as the Wallingford Tornado of 1878. A mother and two of her children were killed in Wethersfield, and 10 others were injured before the tornado lifted outside of the town. What may have <b>been</b> <b>another</b> tornado caused additional damage as far east as Coventry. Another tornado struck East Windsor, damaging several homes and barns. Yet another touched down near Killingly, moving northeast into Rhode Island and Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|It {{appears that}} St Peter's church, {{the remains of}} which stand in modern Castle Park, may have <b>been</b> <b>another</b> minster, {{possibly}} with 8th-century origins. By the time of Domesday the church held three hides of land, which was a sizeable holding for a mere parish church. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 1052 Harold Godwinson took ship to Brycgstow and later in 1062 he took ships from the town to subdue the forces of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn of Wales, indicating {{the status of the}} town as a port.|$|E
5|$|Late Carboniferous and Early Permian insect orders {{include both}} extant groups, their stem groups, {{and a number}} of Paleozoic groups, now extinct. During this era, some giant dragonfly-like forms reached wingspans of , making them far larger than any living insect. This {{gigantism}} may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels that allowed increased respiratory efficiency relative to today. The lack of flying vertebrates could have <b>been</b> <b>another</b> factor. Most extinct orders of insects developed during the Permian period that began around 270 million years ago. Many of the early groups became extinct during the Permian-Triassic extinction event, the largest mass extinction {{in the history of the}} Earth, around 252 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Charles Diehl {{regarded}} early 7th-century Byzantine Africa to {{have undergone}} {{an economic and}} demographic decline, being under constant threat by hostile Berbers. Later historians, however, have had to revise this picture in light of archaeological evidence: the Exarchate {{was among the most}} affluent areas of the Byzantine Empire, though of lesser wealth and significance than Egypt. It seems to have seen much less warfare than the Balkans, Mesopotamia and the Caucasus did in that era, thus allowing its residents a safer way of life. There is evidence of ongoing trade between Byzantine Africa and Frankish Gaul during the 7th century. Agriculture was thriving, particularly {{in the vicinity of the}} Medjerda River. The production of grain, olive oil and wine kept the local population well-fed and probably supplied their maritime trade. Fishing seems to have <b>been</b> <b>another</b> thriving field. The local elite seems to have invested in the building of churches. The main testaments to their existence and activities are examples of funerary art, particularly mosaics. Heraclius the Elder seems to have established ties with this elite. His son, Heraclius the Younger, married his first wife Eudokia during the 7th century. Her father was Rogas, a landowner in the Exarchate.|$|E
60|$|The {{theory of}} the {{mechanic}} forces <b>is</b> <b>another</b> example. What we gain in power is lost in time, and the converse.

The barren soil does not breed fevers, crocodiles, tigers or scorpions.|$|R

5|$|During the 19th century {{good quality}} {{limestone}} {{and a small}} amount of lead ore were quarried in the village. Jasper was mined at Carreg; granite was quarried at Porth y Pistyll; and there was a brickworks at Porth Neigwl. The main source of income, however, was herring fishing. A regular shipping service was operated to Liverpool, exporting pigs, poultry and eggs; the vessels returned laden with coal for the neighbourhood. Limestone was also imported and offloaded into the water at high tide, then collected from the beach when the tide went out. Lime was needed to reduce the acidity of the local soil, and lime kilns were built on the beaches at Porthor, Porth Orion, Porth Meudwy, Aberdaron and Y Rhiw to convert the limestone to quicklime. There was shipbuilding at Porth Neigwl, where the last ship, a sloop named the Ebenezer, was built in 1841; and at Porthor, which came to an end with the building of a schooner, the Sarah, in 1842. Aberdaron's last ship, the sloop Victory, had been built in 1792, and the last ship to come out of Porth Ysgo had <b>been</b> <b>another</b> sloop, the Grace, in 1778.|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} missing B {{vitamins}} which were reclassified or {{determined not to}} be vitamins. For example, B9 is folic acid and five of the folates {{are in the range}} B11 through B16, forms of other vitamins already discovered, not required as a nutrient by the entire population (like B10, PABA for internal use), biologically inactive, toxic, or with unclassifiable effects in humans, or not generally recognised as vitamins by science, such as the highest-numbered, which some naturopath practitioners call B21 and B22. There are also nine lettered B complex vitamins (e.g. Bm). There are other D vitamins now recognised as other substances, which some sources of the same type number up to D7. The controversial cancer treatment laetrile was at one point lettered as vitamin B17. There appears to be no consensus on any vitamins Q, R, T, V, W, X, Y or Z, nor are there substances officially designated as Vitamins N or I, although the latter may have <b>been</b> <b>another</b> form of one of the other vitamins or a known and named nutrient of another type.|$|E
5|$|There is {{only one}} extant {{manuscript}} of Candide that was written before the work's 1759 publication; it was discovered in 1956 by Wade and since named the La Vallière Manuscript. It {{is believed to have}} been sent, chapter by chapter, by Voltaire to the Duke and Duchess La Vallière in the autumn of 1758. The manuscript was sold to the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in the late eighteenth century, where it remained undiscovered for almost two hundred years. The La Vallière Manuscript, the most original and authentic of all surviving copies of Candide, was probably dictated by Voltaire to his secretary, Jean-Louis Wagnière, then edited directly. In addition to this manuscript, there is believed to have <b>been</b> <b>another,</b> one copied by Wagnière for the Elector Charles-Théodore, who hosted Voltaire during the summer of 1758. The existence of this copy was first postulated by Norman L. Torrey in 1929. If it exists, it remains undiscovered.|$|E

5|$|On 23 April, a heavy storm {{swept the}} Eastern Atlantic, {{striking}} Warren's squadron and their prizes. Marengo was seriously damaged, losing all three masts and {{taking on a}} large quantity of water {{that had to be}} pumped overboard by the understrength crew working in shifts. Five men were drowned. Ramilles also suffered in the high winds, losing almost all her masts and rolling for some hours, completely out of control. It was only when the storm had abated that jury masts could be raised and the scattered ships could rejoin the squadron for its journey back to Britain, arriving at Spithead. Willaumez eventually returned to the North Atlantic in the early summer, passing through the Caribbean before being dispersed in a hurricane, his ships scattered across the Western Atlantic. Most eventually reached France, but the campaign had <b>been</b> <b>another</b> disaster for the French Navy, with {{less than half of the}} ships sent out returning to Brest. The loss of Marengo and Belle Poule formed a footnote to the campaign, but the defeat of Linois was widely celebrated in Britain, where both ships were commissioned into the Royal Navy under their French names. Linois was praised for his defence of his ship in the face of overwhelming British force, and historian William James, writing in 1827, considered that had Linois faced London alone he might have had the advantage. Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants from London and Amazon still living in 1847.|$|E
