5|$|As before, {{the uniform}} buttons could also {{reflect the state}} loyalties of an individual. All of the Confederate States {{made an effort to}} supply their {{respective}} State <b>buttons</b> <b>to</b> their troops. The states that did not join the Confederacy, but had men within its ranks, such as Maryland and Missouri, also made buttons, that have turned up on surviving uniforms.|$|E
50|$|The {{control system}} of Stargate expands on {{that of the}} Defender arcade game. It has a {{joystick}} to move up and down, a 'Reverse' <b>button</b> <b>to</b> toggle the player's horizontal direction, and a 'Thrust' <b>button</b> <b>to</b> move in that direction. There is also a Fire button for shooting, a <b>button</b> <b>to</b> activate a smart bomb, a <b>button</b> <b>to</b> turn on the Inviso cloaking device, and a hyperspace button which teleports the player to a random position in the level, at a risk of either exploding upon rematerialization, or materializing onto an enemy or enemy projectile.|$|R

5|$|Adults who {{do believe}} that zero is even can {{nevertheless}} be unfamiliar with thinking of it as even, enough so to measurably slow them down in a reaction time experiment. Stanislas Dehaene, {{a pioneer in the}} field of numerical cognition, led a series of such experiments in the early 1990s. A numeral or a number word is flashed to the subject on a monitor, and a computer records the time it takes the subject to push one of two <b>buttons</b> <b>to</b> identify the number as odd or even. The results showed that 0 was slower to process than other even numbers. Some variations of the experiment found delays as long as 60 milliseconds or about 10% of the average reaction time—a small difference but a significant one.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{interface}} of the 3DS, {{as well as to}} take advantage of the touch screen, 3D has vastly unique controls when compared to other games in the Metal Gear series. While the game has been heavily criticized for these control changes, use of the Circle Pad Pro peripheral has been cited to alleviate much of the control issues of the 3DS. This is done by restoring camera movement to the second analog stick, adding ZL and ZR buttons for aiming and attacking, and allowing the face <b>buttons</b> <b>to</b> be used in a manner more in line with all other releases in the Metal Gear series.|$|E
5|$|In games {{subject to}} time control, a chess clock is used, {{consisting}} of two adjacent clocks and <b>buttons</b> <b>to</b> stop one clock while starting the other, such that the two component clocks never run simultaneously. The clock can be analog or digital though a digital clock is highly preferred under both USCF and FIDE rulesets. This is since most tournaments now include either a time delay (a countdown to when a clock starts again) or add (extra time being added prior or after the move) to their time controls. Before {{the start of the}} game, either the arbiter decides, or whomever is playing Black, where the chess clock is placed.|$|E

5|$|Progress is {{punctuated by}} cutscenes and codec, {{as well as}} {{encounters}} with bosses. To progress, players must discover the weaknesses of each boss and defeat them. Play controls and strategies can also be accessed via the Codec radio, where advice is delivered from Snake's support team; for example, the support team may chastise Snake for not saving his progress often enough, or explain his combat moves in terms of which <b>buttons</b> <b>to</b> press on the gamepad. The Codec {{is also used to}} provide exposition on the game's backstory.|$|E
5|$|The Roland VK-7, {{introduced}} in 1997, attempted {{to emulate the}} sound of a Hammond using digital signal processing technology. An updated version, the VK-8, which appeared in 2002, also provided emulations of other vintage keyboards and provided a connector for a Leslie. Clavia introduced the Nord Electro in 2001; this used <b>buttons</b> <b>to</b> emulate the physical action of pulling or pushing a drawbar, with an LED graph indicating its current state. Clavia has released several updated versions of the Electro since then, and introduced the Nord Stage with the same technology. The Nord C2D was Clavia's first organ with real drawbars. Diversi, founded by former Hammond-Suzuki sales rep Tom Tuson in 2003, has specialised in Hammond clones, and featured a notable endorsement from Joey DeFrancesco.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Shiny Festa eschews {{the simulation}} format of previous Idolmaster games, and instead features a rhythmic gameplay {{in which the}} player times the presses of <b>buttons</b> <b>to</b> {{the rhythm of the}} songs and a predetermined pattern displayed on the screen. Each game features a different array of characters and songs, and also includes an original video animation episode produced by A-1 Pictures and directed by Atsushi Nishigori. The games' story centers on the 765 Production's participation in a music festival, and is told via the anime episodes and occasional dialogue included in the games.|$|E

5|$|The player {{would sit}} at the stand and press the <b>buttons</b> <b>to</b> make their moves, while one panel of lights showed {{the state of the}} game, and another showed the computer's {{calculations}} during its move. The computer could be set to make its calculations at various speeds, slowing down so that the demonstrator could describe exactly what the computer was doing in real time. A visual guide attached to the Nimrod explained what the computer was doing during its turn, as well as showing possible game states and how they would be represented by the lights. Signs stating which player's turn it was and whether one or the other had won would light up as appropriate during gameplay.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1815, Bute had his Glamorgan estates fully surveyed, which {{highlighted}} that the estates had been neglected {{for many years}} and were now in a poor condition. Edward Richards became the senior official in charge of the estates by 1824 and represented Bute on both estate and political affairs across the region. Despite this, Bute retained the final authority over even quite minor issues on the estates, including making decisions on the <b>buttons</b> <b>to</b> be used on local school uniforms or the reuse of a broken flag pole, for example, which could result in considerable delays as letters were sent between South Wales and Scotland. As the complexity of the Glamorgan estates grew, more officials were appointed to help manage the docks, farms and mineral interests, but these all reported separately to Bute, putting increasing pressure on the marquess.|$|E
5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The <b>buttons</b> <b>to</b> turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E

5|$|Hudson {{explained}} {{that they wanted to}} evolve the pseudo-turn-based combat of Knights of the Old Republic into a real-time third-person shooter interface. The combat was meant to offer the tactics and customization of a role-playing game, but through a simpler and more intuitive user interface. It was also designed so that players would not need to press many <b>buttons</b> <b>to</b> pull off the squad's different attack combinations. The team worked closely with Microsoft on several elements of the interface to make sure the combat was tactical enough, and went through a lot of trial and error to balance the combat between role-playing game and shooter. Creating a great sense of discovery was a major goal. Developers wanted the game to feature an actual galaxy that could be explored beyond the core story locations. Although a very large team manually built several parts of the galaxy, the tools and technologies they developed helped them extend the playable space significantly.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter of 2012, the Naga 2012 was released. Similarly to the Naga Epic, it came with {{interchangeable}} side panels. The Naga 2012 supported Razer's Synapse 2.0 software allowing all the <b>buttons</b> <b>to</b> be programmed and that information to be stored online. The other 2012 installment was the Naga Hex, the first mouse in the series to have only six programmable side-on buttons. Razer noted it was made for multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs), such as League of Legends and Diablo 3, instead of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs). In May of the same year, the Wraith Red edition was released. The only difference between the versions was the coloring. In March 2013, after the announcement of a partnership between Razer and Riot Games, a League of Legends style Naga Hex was released, with the only difference being the design and the change from a plastic to a matte surface.|$|E
5|$|Killer Instinct Gold is a 1996 {{fighting}} {{video game}} {{based on the}} arcade game Killer Instinct2. The game was developed by Rare and released by Nintendo for the Nintendo64 video game console. As in other series entries, players control characters who fight on a 2D plane set against a 3D background. Players press <b>buttons</b> <b>to</b> punch and kick their opponent in chains of successive hits, known as combos. Large combo successions lead to stronger attacks and brutal, stylistic finisher moves underscored by an announcer. Charactersincluding a gargoyle, a ninja, and a femme fatalefight in settings such as a jungle and a spaceship. Killer Instinct Gold includes the arcade release's characters, combos, and 3D, pre-rendered environments, but excludes its full-motion video sequences and some voiceovers due to restrictions of the cartridge media format. The Gold release adds a training mode, new camera views, and improved audiovisuals.|$|E

5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} in the Tony Hawk's series, Underground {{is centered on}} skateboarding {{in a series of}} levels. The player performs tricks via combinations of analog stick and button inputs. For example, the player initiates an ollie (a jump trick) by holding and releasing the jump button. During an ollie, the player may change the position of the analog stick and press one of two <b>buttons</b> <b>to</b> perform either a flip trick (such as an impossible or kickflip) or a grab trick (such as a benihana or nosegrab). The player can grind on certain edges and rails; different tricks may be performed during a grind based on the position of the analog stick. On quarter pipes, the player may execute lip tricks. While skating on flat surfaces, the player may manual in multiple ways via button combinations. Miscellaneous tricks include acid drops and wall-rides.|$|E
5|$|Real Madrid has {{maintained}} the white shirt for its home kit {{throughout the history}} of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Escobal and Quesada in 1925; the two were traveling through England when they noticed the kit worn by London-based team Corinthian F.C., {{one of the most famous}} teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship. It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck. By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding <b>buttons</b> <b>to</b> the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts. English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.|$|E
5|$|The game {{progresses}} linearly {{from one}} story event to the next, usually {{presented as a}} cutscene, though there are numerous side quests available that provide benefits to the characters. Players may also choose {{the order in which}} they tackle some areas. Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. Combat in Kingdom Hearts occurs in real time and involves pressing <b>buttons</b> <b>to</b> initiate attacks by the on-screen character. An action menu, similar to those found in Final Fantasy games, found at the bottom left of the screen provides other combat options such as using magic and items, although players can also assign selected magic spells that can be instantly used whilst holding the shoulder button. As players progress through the game, they can receive certain Disney characters as summons, such as Dumbo and Tinker Bell, each with their own unique abilities. There is also a context-sensitive option {{at the bottom of the}} menu, usually used for interacting with the environment or performing special attacks. This menu is manipulated by using the right analog stick or digital pad, while movement is controlled by the left analog stick, allowing the player to navigate the menu while avoiding or approaching enemies.|$|E
