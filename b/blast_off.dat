5|$|Saint Kitts and Nevis sent seven {{athletes to}} the 2012 Summer Olympics. One athlete, the {{sprinter}} Tameka Williams, admitted prior to {{competing in the}} London Games that she took <b>Blast</b> <b>Off</b> Red, which is typically used to increase the performance of horses and greyhounds. It was announced on July 29 {{that she would not}} compete. Kim Collins, who has competed in every Olympics that Saint Kitts and Nevis has participated in, was not allowed to compete by his Olympic committee. Collins was required to stay in the Olympic village, but instead stayed with his wife (who was also his coach), closer to the track. The committee said he had violated team rules, and did not allow him to compete.|$|E

5|$|Tameka Williams {{qualified}} {{to run in}} the 100 meter and 200 meter sprints. Williams, who would later compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics, was disqualified because she admitted that she used a banned substance. She voluntarily told her Olympic committee about using a banned substance, and it was announced on July 29 that she would not compete. Williams admitted to using a drug named <b>Blast</b> <b>Off</b> Red, which is typically used to enhance the performance of racehorses and greyhounds. Williams had posted on Facebook that she was innocent and had passed drug tests prior to the Olympics. While the drug is not listed as prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency, it falls into the category of veterinary medicine and therefore its use is not permitted.|$|E

25|$|Banks demanded more {{protection}} and safe makers responded by designing larger, heavier safes. Safes {{with a key}} lock were still vulnerable through the key hole, and bank robbers soon learned to <b>blast</b> <b>off</b> the door by pouring explosives in this opening. In 1861, inventor Linus Yale Jr. introduced the modern combination lock. Bankers quickly adopted Yale's lock for their safes, but bank robbers came up with several ways {{to get past the}} new invention. It was possible to use force to punch the combination lock through the door. Other experienced burglars learned to drill holes into the lock case and use mirrors to view the slots in the combination wheels inside the mechanism. A more direct approach was to simply kidnap the bank manager and force him to reveal the combination.|$|E
25|$|At Pacific Playland, {{the sisters}} {{activate}} all the rides and lights {{and begin to}} enjoy the park, but also unwittingly draw the attention of all the zombies in the surrounding area. A chase ensues, {{and just as the}} sisters are trapped on a drop tower ride called <b>Blast</b> <b>Off,</b> Tallahassee and Columbus arrive. Tallahassee lures the zombies away from the tower, creating a distraction for Columbus to get to the tower ride; both use the attractions to their advantage. Tallahassee eventually locks himself in a game booth, shooting zombies as they arrive. Columbus successfully evades and shoots through several zombies to reach the tower and help the girls down, but not before changing one of his rules for survival to conquer his coulrophobia by facing off against a clown zombie. In thanks, Wichita kisses Columbus and reveals her real name: Krista.|$|E
25|$|Ralph Cornish is {{determined}} to launch another spacecraft to retrieve his astronauts, who the Doctor believes {{are still in the}} Mars Probe capsule in Earth orbit. The Doctor volunteers to pilot the rocket himself. As he prepares to <b>blast</b> <b>off,</b> Reegan tries to sabotage the mission by tampering with the fuel, but the Doctor survives and succeeds in piloting the craft to its scheduled rendezvous in Earth orbit, but at the last moment an enormous spacecraft bears down on the two linked capsules and engulfs them. Aboard the alien spaceship, the Doctor discovers the three human astronauts, unharmed, but they have been mentally conditioned to believe they are in extended quarantine at Space Control on Earth. An alien being reveals itself and explains the humans are being held pending the safe return of the alien ambassadors, who have been sent to Earth to make peaceful contact with mankind. The Doctor assures the alien commander that the authorities on Earth knew nothing of this, and gives his personal guarantee to return the ambassadors safely. The alien commander threatens to destroy the world if the ambassadors are harmed.|$|E

25|$|The children's {{areas in}} Canada's Wonderland all began as The Happyland of Hanna-Barbera. The three areas were themed as Yogi's Woods, Scoobyville, and Bedrock; {{the first was}} {{converted}} to Smurf Village in 1984 and the last also had a marine mammal show held at the Bedrock Aquarium. In 1993, the Smurf area transitioned to Kids Kingdom, which became Kidzville in 1998. In 2003, Bedrock became Nickelodeon Central; Bedrock Aquarium and its marine mammal show closed down as well. Planet Snoopy, based on the comic strip Peanuts, replaced Nickelodeon Central for the 2010 season, standardizing the park {{with the rest of}} the Cedar Fair chain. A fourth themed area is Zoom Zone. Quite small, it is part of Kidzville. Created in 2001 with the debut of Silver Streak, it also contains the small rides <b>Blast</b> <b>Off,</b> and Jumpin' Jet. One of the Kidzville rides, and originally a Kids Kingdom ride, Jumbo Bumps, was removed to make way for these three rides and the new section. Starting in 2004, Zoom Zone was no longer shown on park maps as an independent section. However, since Cedar Fair's takeover, each of the three rides mentions it is in Zoom Zone, and park signage continues to use the name.|$|E
500|$|Drake resumed work on {{the album}} in October 2009, {{following}} an onstage injury from a July 2009 concert. Recording sessions for the album took place at several recording studios, including Metalworks Studios, BLD, and Cherry Beach Studios in Toronto, Nightbird Studios in West Hollywood, Gee Jam Studios in Portland, Jamaica, The Setai Hotel Recording Studio and The Hit Factory in Miami, <b>Blast</b> <b>Off</b> Studios and Rock the Mic in New York, Glenwood Studios in Los Angeles, Triangle Sounds Studios in Atlanta, Takeover Studios in Houston, and Avex Recording Studio in Honolulu.

500|$|... "Meteorite" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Carey and Q-Tip. It was recorded by Brian Garten and Blair Wells at several locations, including Rapture Studios in Bel Air, Metrocity Studios and Jungle City Studios in New York City, and Pon de Islands Studio in Antigua. Rob Sucheck {{served as the}} assistant during the recording sessions. Manny Marroquin mixed the song at Larrabee Studios in Universal City, and was assisted by Chris Galland and Delbert Bowers. [...] "Meteorite" [...] is a disco song with influences of dance music and 1980s style pop music, which lasts for a duration of three minutes and 59 seconds. Mike Wass of Idolator noted that Carey has dabbled with disco music since the release of [...] "Fantasy" [...] in 1995, but [...] "never as faithfully" [...] as she does on [...] "Meteorite" [...] and [...] "You Don't Know What to Do" [...] on Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse.

500|$|After {{numerous}} confrontations {{and challenges}} with many ghosts, portrait ghosts, boss ghosts, Boos, puzzles, and locked doors, Luigi confronts King Boo, who has trapped Mario inside a painting like the portrait ghosts and hung {{him in a}} secret altar in the basement. King Boo pulls Luigi into a painting for their final battle in an arena that resembles the mansion's roof within a fiery background, puppeteering a lifelike Bowser suit from the inside. Using spiked, explosive metal balls thrown by [...] "Bowser", Luigi {{finds a way to}} <b>blast</b> <b>off</b> the suit's head and eventually vacuum and defeat King Boo, causing [...] "Bowser" [...] to collapse. Luigi returns to E. Gadd with Mario's painting and successfully extracts him from within it using the Ghost Portrificationizer in reverse. King Boo is turned into a painting along with the other portrait ghosts. The ending also sees the haunted mansion disappear, after which Professor E. Gadd uses the treasure Luigi collected on his adventure to build a new, non-haunted mansion {{on the site of the}} original mansion. The size of the house depends on how much treasure the player gathered before the end of the game.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of [...] "The Exciting Middle Part", while Eliminators destroy Yugopotamia, Timmy is in Fairy World in front of fairy game geeks. He plays The Chosen One Video Game, which utilizes a white wand guitar controller that imitates the actual white wand, like a Guitar Hero controller that imitates a real guitar. When Mark's space pod plunges into the Earth and destroys an Eliminator disguised as Mark, the Eliminator's feet curl up in a way reminiscent of the Wicked Witch of the East from the Wizard of Oz. At {{the site of the}} Abracatraz Prison where the kidnapped fairies are held hostage, its front gate contains an inscription that reads [...] "Abandon all hope, ye who here enter", which when translated into Italian reads [...] "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate", the phrase used at the entrance gate to Hell in the Inferno chapter of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. In order to get Dark Laser to come to Earth so Timmy, along with Mr. Crocker and Vicky, can board on his Death Ball and <b>blast</b> <b>off</b> into space, Timmy posts a video that ridicules him onto a video-sharing website called [...] "TooYube", whose name and logo {{are similar to those of}} YouTube. Before heading to the Blue Moon, Turbo Thunder flies Timmy and Mark from Fridgidarium to another planet, Thunder World. The planet features a [...] "thunder wonderland", an amusement park with a Las Vegas Strip theme, evidenced by hotels and palm trees.|$|E
