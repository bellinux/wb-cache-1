40|$|This essay {{seeks to}} examine the concept of mateship from the {{perspectives}} of consequentialist and virtue ethics. It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> mateship <b>is</b> a prominent concept in the way Australians think of themselves. However it <b>is</b> also <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> mateship <b>is</b> linked to solidarity and commitment in time of war. It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> what we should recognize mateship is one of the factors that facilitates and perpetuates war. It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> mateship <b>is</b> also questionable as a character virtue, given what mateship entails. It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> ultimately we need to examine more closely the consequences of the solidarity that we define as mateship, and we need to query more closely what we regard as virtues. Article The phenomenon of mateship is often claimed within public discourse to be a defining characteristic {{of what it means to}} be Australian. Recently there was a suggestion that there be a specific reference within the Australian Constitution to the value of mateship for Australians (Howard 1999). One could even suggest tha...|$|R
