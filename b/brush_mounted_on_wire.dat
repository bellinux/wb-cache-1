40|$|Aims/hypothesis. The {{impact of}} early vitamin E sup-plementation on {{vascular}} function in diabetes remains unresolved. Therefore, {{we examined the}} effects of vitamin E on functional and structural parameters and on chemical markers that are disturbed in diabetes in mesenteric and femoral arteries. Methods. Segments of both arteries, taken from con-trol and 8 -week-old streptozotocin diabetic Wistar rats that were treated or not with vitamin E, were <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>wire</b> and pressure myographs, after which endothe-lium-dependent and-independent vasodilation was assessed. Passive mechanical wall properties and the localisation and levels of protein kinase C (PKC) -β 2 and AGE were evaluated in these vessels. Results. Vitamin E supplementation was associated with improved endothelium-dependent and-indepen-dent vasodilatation in mesenteric arteries from diabetic rats. Impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in diabetic mesenteric vessels was associated with PKC-β 2 up-regulation and this was prevented by vita-min E supplementation. Increased AGE accumulation and plasma isoprostane levels in diabetic rats were not changed by vitamin E. In the femoral artery, vitamin E supplementation had no effect on endothelium-depen-dent or-independent vasodilatation, but did prevent the wall stiffening associated with diabetes. Conclusions/interpretation. Early vitamin E supple-mentation has a beneficial effect on diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction in resistance arteries. This benefit may arise from a direct effect on smooth mus-cle function, as a result of inhibition of the PKC-β 2 isoform by vitamin E...|$|R

We have investigated the effects of spontaneous running exercise from 4 – 20 weeks of age on. aortic and mesenteric compliance and vascular reactivity in Wistar-Kyoto WKY rats. Methods: Animals were killed using CO 2 asphyxia and the aorta, mesentery and heart rapidly removed. The heart was dissected and weighed. The aorta was separated into 3 4 -mm rings which were <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>wires</b> in organ baths for determination of compliance and vascular reactivity to noradrenaline, acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside.

40|$|Calcium channel {{blockers}} {{are widely}} used to treat cardiovascular disease (CVD) including hypertension. As aging is an independent risk factor for CVD, the use of calcium channel blockers increases with increasing age. Hence, {{this study was designed}} to evaluate the effect of aging on the sensitivity of small mesenteric arteries to L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (LTCC) blockers and also to investigate whether there was a concomitant change in calcium current density. Third order mesenteric arteries from male F 344 rats, aged 2. 5 - 3 months (young) and 22 - 26 months (old) were <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>wire</b> myograph to measure the tension during isometric contraction. Arteries were contracted with 100 mM KCl and were then relaxed in a cumulative concentration-response dependent manner with nifedipine (0. 1 nM - 10 µM), verapamil (0. 1 nM- 10 µM) or diltiazem (0. 1 nM - 10 µM). Relaxation-concentration response curves produced by cumulative concentrations of three different calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in arteries of old rats were shifted to the right with statistically significant IC 50 s. pEC 50 ± s. e. m: (8. 37 ± 0. 06 vs 8. 04 ± 0. 05, 7. 40 ± 0. 07 vs 6. 81 ± 0. 04 and 6. 58 ± 0. 07 vs 6. 34 ± 0. 06) in young vs old. It was observed that the maximal contractions induced by 100 mM KCl, phenylephrine and reversed by sodium nitroprusside were not different between young and old groups. However, Bay K 8644 increased resting tension by 23 ± 4. 8 % in young arteries and 4. 7 ± 1. 6 % in old arteries. LTCC current density were also significantly lower in old arteries (- 2. 77 ± 0. 45 pA/pF) compared to young arteries (- 4. 5 ± 0. 40 pA/pF); with similar steady-state activation and inactivation curves. Parallel to this reduction, the expression of Cav 1. 2 protein was reduced by 57 ± 5 % in arteries from old rats compared to those from young rats. In conclusion, our results suggest that aging reduces the response of small mesenteric arteries to the vasodilatory effect of the CCBs and this may be due to, at least in part, reduced current density of LTCC...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn vitro, {{different}} {{techniques are}} used to study the smooth muscle cells’ calcium dynamics and contraction/relaxation mechanisms on arteries. Most experimental studies use either an isometric or an isobaric setup. However, in vivo, a blood vessel is neither isobaric nor isometric nor isotonic, as it is continuously submitted to intraluminal pressure variations arising from heart beat. We use a theoretical model of the smooth muscle calcium and arterial radius dynamics to determine whether results may be considerably different depending on the experimental conditions (isometric, isobaric, isotonic, or cyclic pressure variations). We show that isobaric conditions {{appear to be more}} realistic than isometric or isotonic situations, as the calcium dynamics is similar under cyclic intraluminal pressure variations (in vivo-like situation) and under a constant pressure (isobaric situation). The arterial contraction is less pronounced in isotonic than in isobaric conditions, and the vasoconstrictor sensitivity higher in isometric than isobaric or isotonic conditions, in agreement with experimental observations. Interestingly, the model predicts that isometric conditions may generate artifacts like the coexistence of multiple stable states. We have verified this model prediction experimentally using rat mesenteric arteries <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a <b>wire</b> myograph and stimulated with phenylephrine...|$|R

The MI sensors in off-diagonal configuration when the signal is taken from the coil <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> the <b>wire</b> {{have a number of}} advantages including linearity, enhanced output voltage, and resonance detection circuitry. In this work, the off-diagonal impedance of a number of Co-rich glass-coated amorphous wires placed in the same coil is investigated. The wires are connected in parallel and excited by a harmonic current with optimised dc bias which is used to remove the domain structure. The best sensitivity of about 350 mV/Oe is obtained for two closely spaced wires at the excitation frequency of 20 MHz which corresponds to the resonance conditions for the detection circuit having only 55 turns. The full scale and linearity range are also increased almost twice in comparison with those when only one wire is used. The response drops if the distance between the wires is increased which is due to a strong effect of the magnetostatic interaction between the wires. We conclude that the off-diagonal MI sensors with multiple wires can provide higher transfer function per one turn and could be advantageous for localised field detection...|$|R

40|$|Background: In vitro {{studies of}} {{myocardial}} tissue suggest that angiotensin II (Ang II) may be generated by both ACE and chymase. A similar dual pathway may {{exist in the}} vasculature. We studied the effects of ACE and chymase inhibitors on the contractile response to angiotensin I (Ang I) in human resistance arteries to investigate ACE-independent generation of Ang II. Methods and Results—Subcutaneous resistance arteries (250 to 350 µm) were obtained from gluteal biopsies from volunteers and New Zealand White rabbits and <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a <b>wire</b> myograph. Contractile ability was tested with high-potassium depolarization and norepinephrine 10 µmol/L and endothelial integrity by relaxation to acetylcholine 3 µmol/L. Cumulative concentration-response curves were constructed for Ang I {{in the presence of}} enalaprilat 1 µmol/L, chymostatin 10 µmol/L, or both inhibitors together. In the rabbit, enalaprilat completely inhibited the Ang I response. In human vessels, enalaprilat or chymostatin alone had no effect, but the combination of enalaprilat and chymostatin almost completely inhibited the response to Ang I. Conclusions: A dual pathway for Ang II generation exists in human resistance arteries, mediated by ACE and a chymostatin-sensitive enzyme, probably chymase. We confirm that a marked species difference exists in the mechanism of Ang II generation between the human and the rabbit. More efficacious suppression of the renin-angiotensin system may require development of novel enzyme inhibitors or combinations of currently available drugs. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: : Structural {{alterations}} of subcutaneous small resistance arteries, {{as indicated}} by an increased media-to-lumen ratio, are frequently present in hypertensive and/or diabetic patients, and may represent the earliest alteration observed. Furthermore, media-to-lumen ratio of small arteries evaluated by micromyography has a strong prognostic significance; however, its extensive evaluation {{is limited by the}} invasivity of the assessment, since a biopsy of subcutaneous fat is needed. Noninvasive measurement of wall-to-lumen of retinal arterioles using scanning laser Doppler flowmetry (SLDF) has recently been introduced. However, this new technique has not yet been compared to micromyographic measurement, generally considered the gold standard approach. METHODS AND RESULTS: : We investigated 40 individuals and patients, 24 of them were hypertensive patients and 16 normotensive individuals. All patients underwent a biopsy of subcutaneous fat during an elective surgical intervention. Subcutaneous small resistance arteries were dissected and <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a <b>wire</b> myograph, and media-to-lumen ratio was measured.

Small femoral arteries were isolated from ERβKO and WT mice and <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a <b>wire</b> myograph. Concentration–response curves to ACh were compared before and after incubation with inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI 2) synthesis. Comparison of the expression of the principal vascular connexins (Cx 37, 40 and 43), implicated in EDHF-mediated dilatation were undertaken by immunohistochemistry. Vascular ultrastructure was studied by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. ACh-induced relaxation of arteries (< 200 μm internal diameter) was greater in WT females versus males and was attributable to a greater EDHF component of relaxation. This sex difference was absent in ERβKO mice. Arteries from ERβKO males (but not females) were more sensitive to ACh compared to WT. The pharmacological evidence and morphological prerequisite for involvement of gap junctions in EDHF-mediated responses was confirmed in male arteries. The absence of ERβ had no influence on expression of main Cx subtypes within vascular wall or on ultrastructure and morphology of the endothelium.
