5|$|Vocabulary {{development}} is a process by which people acquire words. Babbling shifts towards meaningful speech as infants grow and produce their first words around the age of one year. In early word learning, infants build their vocabulary slowly. By the age of 18 months, infants can typically produce about 50 words and <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> word combinations.|$|E
5|$|Koss {{arrives on}} board Enterprise {{to speak to}} his wife, T'Pol. He gives her an IDIC pendant from her mother, who he {{explains}} is also a Syrrannite. The pendant projects a map showing a path across a desert on Vulcan called “the Forge”, which Archer believes will lead them to both T'Pau and T'Pol's mother. T'Pol and Archer leave the ship and <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the crossing, following the map. They soon encounter another traveller, calling himself Arev, who assists, but remains distrustful of them. A sand-fire storm kills Arev, but before he dies, he forcefully performs a mind meld with Archer to transfer his katra. After burying him, a focussed Archer leads T'Pol directly to the concealed T'Karath Sanctuary, where they are quickly captured.|$|E

25|$|All babies imitate {{with their}} hands the {{movements}} that they see. Typical gestures for example are raising arms to be lifted up, or grabbing/reaching to indicate wanting a bottle; these are used referentially. In addition, infants who grow up with a sign language <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> gestures that are distinct from all other hand movements and gestures.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the context}} of Spinoza's {{philosophical}} system, the PSR can be understood to unify causation and explanation. What {{this means is that}} for Spinoza, questions regarding the reason why a given phenomenon {{is the way it is}} (or exists) are always answerable, and are always answerable in terms of the relevant cause(s). This constitutes a rejection of teleological, or final causation, except possibly in a more restricted sense for human beings. Given this, Spinoza's views regarding causality and modality <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> much more sense.|$|E

25|$|However, {{unless a}} team can {{appropriately}} utilize the full capacity of its potential, effectiveness can suffer. One {{factor in the}} effectiveness of team negotiation {{is a problem that}} occurs through solidarity behavior. Solidarity behavior occurs when one team member reduces his or her own utility (benefit) in order to increase the benefits of other team members. This behavior is likely to occur when interest conflicts rise. When the utility/needs of the negotiation opponent does not align with every team member's interests, team members <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> concessions and balance the benefits gained among the team.|$|E
25|$|Artistically, {{the festival}} was a success.

Financially, however, the festival was a disaster and did not <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> money until several years later. Wagner abandoned his original plan to hold a second festival the following year, and travelled to London to conduct a series of concerts {{in an attempt to}} make up the deficit. Although the festival was plagued by financial problems in its early years, it survived through state intervention and the continued support of influential Wagnerians, including King Ludwig II of Bavaria.|$|E
25|$|As the 2006 season went on, {{the team}} went from running ahead of Super Aguri but behind {{everyone}} else, to consistently sparring with other midfield teams such as Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Toro Rosso although it only ever finished ahead of crippled cars, Super Aguri {{and the occasional}} Toro Rosso. Much of that progress was down to tyre development from Bridgestone coupled with significant improvements in aerodynamics and handling (overseen by Simon Phillips and Richard Frith respectively). The improved performance saw the team <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it into the second qualifying session on an occasional basis - eight times {{out of a possible}} 36 overall - with a best qualifying position of 14th.|$|E

25|$|The early {{administrators of}} the colony at Sydney Cove sent groups of prisoners to an area nearby, named The Rocks, to eke out what ever {{existence}} they could from the land and build housing for themselves. These first occupants hewed out sandstone from the outcrops and built simple houses. Convicts were also employed tunnelling through {{what is called the}} 'Argyle Cut' in The Rocks. The rock was dumped in the mangrove swamps {{at the head of the}} Tank Stream to <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Circular Quay. Later development in The Rocks area led to bond stores and warehouses being built on the bay, with better housing and pubs for entertainment. Millions of cubic feet of sandstone was excavated from Sydney's Cockatoo Island to create a dry dock on the island.|$|E
25|$|After it was {{established}} that infants could babble {{with their hands}} and their mouths, the patterns in which productions occurred were studied. Speaking and signing infants follow very similar maturational paths in language acquisition. Both go {{through a number of}} stages, and exhibit similar complexity in their babbling sequences. In studies where deaf and hearing children were compared, children learning sign language produced more multi-movement manual babbling than children who were not learning a sign language. There are three main components of manual babbling. The hand gestures contain a restricted set of phonetic units, show a syllabic organization, and are used without reference or meaning. This is comparable to aspects of vocal babbling as mentioned above. It is difficult to study manual babbling as often the manual activity can be mistaken as gestures rather than signs. When signing children are in fact babbling it will most often take place in front of their torso in a designated area that is called the phonetic space. One of the most common forms of manual babbling is the extension and spreading of all fingers. This babble {{is also one of the}} first indicators that an infant will <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> in manual communication.|$|E

They too head towards Rohan. However, Saruman has used his agent, Gríma Wormtongue, to corrupt Théoden, King of Rohan, {{manipulating}} him into banishing Éomer, captain of the Rohirrim. Saruman plans to use the division caused by this to destroy Rohan. The party meet the resurrected Gandalf, who tells them they must assemble Éomer's men and head towards Helm's Deep, where Rohan will make a last stand against Saruman's army. In the meantime, Gandalf will attempt to release Théoden from Saruman's curse. Soon thereafter, they meet a woman named Morwen (Lori Phillips), who joins the party on the road to Helm's Deep in the hopes of finding her family. Having assembled Éomer's scattered forces, the party <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their way to Helm's Deep. On the journey, Morwen reveals she is originally from Minas Tirith, and the party receive word that Théoden has been released from Saruman's spell. On the road, they meet Éoaden (Charles Martinet), a member of Rohan's Royal Guard, who joins them. Soon thereafter, they find the bodies of Morwen's family, killed by wargs, before arriving at Helm's Deep.|$|E
500|$|The {{establishment}} of a printing press under royal patent in 1507 would <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it easier to disseminate Scottish literature and was probably aimed at bolstering Scottish national identity. The first Scottish press was established in Southgait in Edinburgh by the merchant Walter Chepman (c. 1473–c. 1528) and the bookseller Andrew Myllar (fl. 1505–08). Although the first press was relatively short lived, beside law codes and religious works, the press also produced editions {{of the work of}} Scottish makars before its demise, probably about 1510. The next recorded press was that of Thomas Davidson (f. 1532–42), the first {{in a long line of}} [...] "king's printers", who also produced editions of works of the makars.|$|E

The hub in turn rolls into a gear wheel cog, which falls off the board and into a camshaft and pulley wheel. The camera tracks slowly from left to right, following the domino chain of reactions across an otherwise empty gallery space. The complexity of the interactions increases as the commercial progresses, growing from simple collisions to ziplines made from a bonnet release cable, scales and see-saws constructed from multiple carefully balanced parts, and a swinging mobile of suspended glass windows. Later sequences <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> use of the Accord's electronic systems; the automated water sensors attached to the windscreen are used to make wiper blades start crawling across the floor, and a side door with a door-mirror indicator lowers the automated window to let a part pass through.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100to reviews from mainstream publications, it received an average score of 74, based on 24reviews. Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau said Ranaldo's beautifully played guitar work and monophonic compositions complement his good-natured, cogent lyrics, which are [...] "always palpable whether the songs reach out or recalibrate his options". AllMusic reviewer Heather Phares {{wrote that he}} [...] "expands on those qualities in his music and reveals new ones", [...] "displays a strong and surprising classic rock streak" [...] and [...] "gets downright hippie-ish, in a good way." [...] In a review for The A.V. Club, Elliott Sharp said [...] "Ranaldo's songs mostly adhere to a guitar-driven melancholic-pop mold, with songs like 'Off The Wall,' 'Angles,' and 'Lost' recalling Sonic Youth’s 2006effort Rather Ripped as well as early R.E.M.". Spencer Grady from BBC Music compared the music to The Byrds, Neil Young and R.E.M., and added that [...] "flaws which initially seem awkward <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> perfect sense after a few listens". Drowned in Sound's J.R. Moores said it was [...] "advertised as his first 'rock album'" [...] and impresses sonically.
