5|$|All pulmonate {{land snails}} are hermaphrodites, {{and have a}} {{complete}} and rather elaborate set of <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> reproductive organs (see the simplified anatomical diagram above), {{but the majority of}} pulmonate land snails have no love darts and no dart sac.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> mallards can become aggressive, driving off competitors to {{themselves or their}} mate by charging at them. Males tend to fight more than females, and attack each other by repeatedly pecking at their rival's chest, ripping out feathers and even skin on rare occasions.|$|E
40|$|We use the die-paradigm {{to study}} gender {{differences}} in cheating behavior.

5|$|In Chad, {{homosexual}} acts are illegal {{and can be}} punished by 15 to 20 years in prison. In December 2016, Chad passed a law criminalising <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> same-sex sexual activity {{by a vote of}} 111 to 1.|$|E
5|$|A {{field study}} in Brisbane found that F. rubiginosa trees often bore <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> phase syconia {{at the same}} time, which could be {{beneficial}} for reproduction in isolated populations. The same study found that male phase syconia development persisted through the winter, showing that its wasp pollinator tolerated cooler weather than those of more tropical fig species. F. rubiginosa itself can endure cooler climates than {{other members of the}} genus.|$|E
5|$|A {{resistance}} movement developed in Belgium {{soon after the}} German occupation. The resistance took various forms. Although some sabotages by the resistance, notably {{the destruction of the}} Brussels-Aachen railway line, were celebrated at the time, armed resistance represented a minority of their acts. Around 300 separate resistance networks existed which often included <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> members.|$|E

5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{it is not}} only males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, {{although}} most females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, adolescent lions, <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female,</b> may be evicted.|$|E
5|$|Despite its disappointing box-office returns, in {{what was}} then {{considered}} a risky move, Warner Home Video shipped 320,000 rental video copies throughout the United States in 1995. It went on {{to become one of the}} top rented films of the year. Positive recommendations and repeat customer viewings, and being well received by <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> audiences, were considered key to the film's rental success.|$|E
5|$|Pteranodon {{species are}} {{extremely}} well {{represented in the}} fossil record, allowing for detailed descriptions of their anatomy and analysis of their life history. Over 1,000 specimens have been identified, though less than half are complete enough to give researchers good information on the anatomy of the animal. Still, this is more fossil material than is known for any other pterosaur, and it includes <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> specimens of various age groups and, possibly, species.|$|E

5|$|The Solomon Islands skink is {{completely}} herbivorous, eating many different {{fruits and vegetables}} including the pothos plant. It {{is one of the}} few species of reptile known to function within a social group or circulus. <b>Both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> specimens are known to be territorial and often hostile towards members not a part of their family group.|$|E
5|$|A Six Person Intergender Tag Team Bimbo Brawl {{match with}} Traci Brooks as the Special Guest Referee was next, pitting {{the team of}} ODB, Rhaka Khan, and Rhino against The Beautiful People (Angelina Love, Cute Kip, and Velvet Sky). In this bout, <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> wrestlers could fight each other and all weapons were legal to use. The only way to win was by pinfall or submission. Rhino won the match for his team after {{tackling}} Kip with his signature Gore maneuver at 6 minutes and 15 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Argasid ticks, unlike ixodid ticks, may {{go through}} {{up to seven}} nymphal stages (instars), {{requiring}} a meal of blood each time. Their life cycles range from months to years. The adult female argasid tick can lay a few hundred to over a thousand eggs {{over the course of}} her lifetime. Larvae feed very quickly and detach to molt into nymphs. <b>Both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> adults feed on blood, and they mate off the host. During feeding, any excess fluid is excreted by the coxal glands, a process which is unique to argasid ticks.|$|E

5|$|At {{the edge}} of the Greenstead Parish {{boundary}} is Rovers Tye Farm, which has been documented as being established by 1353. A new causeway at this location had been built by 1429, by which point Ipswich Road ran on its current route. This road was turnpiked in 1725, when the road was predominantly rural in nature. In 1841, a prison, known as the House of Correction or County Gaol, was built on the road to alleviate pressure on Colchester Castle, but it only held about 25 or 30 prisoners, <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female,</b> at any one time.|$|E
5|$|Like other nightjars, it {{will sit}} on roads or paths {{during the night}} and hover to {{investigate}} large intruders such as deer or humans. It may be mobbed by birds while there is still light, and by bats, other nightjar species or Eurasian woodcocks during the night. Owls and other predators such as red foxes will be mobbed by <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> European nightjars. Like other aerial birds, such as swifts and swallows, nightjars make a quick plunge into water to wash. They have a unique serrated comb-like structure on the middle claw {{that is used to}} preen and perhaps remove parasites.|$|E
5|$|Stay-at-home dads are not {{prevalent}} in East Asian countries, which generally have strict traditional gender roles. However, {{a survey conducted}} in 2008 in Japan suggested that nearly one third of married men would accept the role. The Japanese government passed a law in April 1992 allowing time off following {{the birth of a}} child for <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees. In 1996, 0.16% of Japanese fathers took time off of work to raise children. In South Korea, about 5,000 men were stay-at-home dads in 2007. Even so, stay-at-home dads face discrimination from stay-at-home mothers, and are often ostracized.|$|E

5|$|Stony corals {{have a great}} {{range of}} {{reproductive}} strategies and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Many species have separate sexes, the whole colony being either male or female, but others are hermaphroditic, with individual polyps having <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> gonads. Some species brood their eggs but in most species, sexual reproduction results {{in the production of}} a free-swimming planula larva that eventually settles on the seabed to undergo metamorphosis into a polyp. In colonial species, this initial polyp then repeatedly divides asexually, to give rise to the entire colony.|$|E
5|$|Sycamore trees {{produce their}} flowers in hanging {{branched}} clusters known as panicles that contain {{a variety of}} different flower types. Most are morphologically bisexual, with <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> organs, but function as if they were unisexual. Some are both morphologically and functionally male, others morphologically bisexual but function as males, and still others are morphologically bisexual but function as females. All of the flower types can produce pollen, but the pollen from functionally female flowers does not germinate. All flowers produce nectar, the functionally female flowers producing it in greater volume and with a higher sugar content.|$|E
5|$|The Bhagavata Purana, the Devi-Bhagavata Purana and the Linga Purana {{declare that}} Ila ascended to heaven with <b>both</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> anatomy.
