50|$|A Bridge Navigational Watch Alarm System, {{abbreviated}} <b>BNWAS,</b> is {{an automatic}} system which sounds an alarm if the watch {{officer on the}} bridge of a ship falls asleep, becomes otherwise incapacitated, or is absent for too long a time. The <b>BNWAS</b> is automatically engaged when the ship's autopilot is activated.|$|E
50|$|Stage 1:When the {{autopilot}} is engaged, the bridge officer {{is required to}} signal his presence to the <b>BNWAS</b> system every 3 to 12 minutes {{in response to a}} flashing light, either by moving an arm in front of a motion sensor, pressing a confirmation button, or directly applying pressure to the <b>BNWAS</b> centre.|$|E
50|$|The minimum {{requirement}} for a <b>BNWAS</b> under International Maritime Organization standards {{is to have}} a dormant stage and three alarm stages, except that on a non-passenger vessel, the second stage may be omitted.|$|E
40|$|The ordered bifacial copper {{nanowire}} array (Cu <b>BNWA)</b> was synthesized by a template assisted electrochemical deposition method. The morphology {{and structure of}} the as-prepared samples were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results show that the ordered Cu {{nanowire array}} with uniform geometrical dimensions covered both side of the Cu substrate. When used as the electrode for glucose detection, the minimum detectable concentration of glucose can be reached as low as 0. 2  mM. Impressively, the sample still showed high sensitivity and stability for glucose detection after two months placement in ambient environment. These excellent performances of the Cu <b>BNWA</b> make it a promising non-enzyme glucose detection sensor for various applications...|$|R

Sedan dess har olika typer av fartyg haft längre eller kortare tid på sig att installera systemet ombord. Navigatörer har utryckt både positiva och negativa synpunkter på systemet. Syftet med studien var att få en uppfattning om hur implementeringen av <b>BNWAS</b> har utvecklats praktiskt inom sjöfarten. För att undersöka detta har haverirapporter granskats innan samt efter implementeringen. Resultatet från detta har jämförts med tidigare implementeringar inom samma område. Data har sedan kvantitativt och kvalitativt analyserats. Resultaten tyder på att implementeringen av <b>BNWAS</b> har stött på samma problem som liknande implementeringar gjort tidigare. De slutsatser som dragits utifrån dessa resultat var att implementeringen av <b>BNWAS</b> kunde ha gjorts på ett bättre sätt om lärdomar från tidigare implementeringar tagits med i utvecklingen av implementeringen. Studien visade att grundstötningar har minskat i den undersökta haverikommissionens utredningar. <b>BNWAS</b> was {{implemented}} in SOLAS, chapter V in 2009. Since that year, {{different types of}} ships have had different time schedules to install the system onboard. Navigational watch keepers have expressed {{both positive and negative}} attitudes towards the system and the operation of it. The purpose was to shed light upon how the implementetion of <b>BNWAS</b> has developed practically at the end users. The purpose of the study has been fulfilled through both qualitative and quantitative methods. Accident investigation reports {{both before and after the}} implementation were examined togheter with examinations and reviews of earlier studies regarding questions about implementation. This work was done to reach the goal of the study with a reliable result. These results implied that the implementation had encountered the same problems as earlier implementations (in the same area) had. They also showed that groundings of ships occured in the same way both before and after the implementation. The conclusions was that the implementation of <b>BNWAS</b> could have been developed more smoothly if the problems from earlier implementations had been accounted for. The groundings have however been reduced significantly since the implementation, whether it is due to the implementation or something else is still to be found out with a more comprehensive study...|$|E
