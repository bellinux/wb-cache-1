After CR96, the route becomes residential once again, entering the hamlet of Pendleton Center, crossing over former railroad right-of-way near Pendleton Town Park. Continuing northward, NY270 enters {{the center of the}} hamlet, intersecting with the termini of both CR40 (<b>Beach</b> <b>Ridge</b> Road) and CR121 (Feigle Road) at the same intersection. After Pendleton Center, NY270 bends northeast running along Campbell Boulevard through the town of Pendleton as a two-lane residential street. Serving the eastern terminus of CR32 (Mapleton Road), NY270 begins bending north, intersecting with CR6 (Lockport Road).|$|E

Left behind were the gravel and sand deposits that were once the beaches of the former lake.

40|$|Two depositional {{models to}} account for Holocene gravel-dominated <b>beach</b> <b>ridges</b> covered by dunes, {{occurring}} on the northern coast of Ireland, are considered {{in the light of}} infrared-stimulated luminescence ages of sand units within <b>beach</b> <b>ridges,</b> and 14 C ages from organic horizons in dunes. A new chronostratigraphy obtained from prograded <b>beach</b> <b>ridges</b> with covering dunes at Murlough, north-east Ireland, supports a model of mesoscale alternating sediment decoupling (ASD) on the upper beach, rather than macroscale sequential sediment sourcing {{to account for}} prograded <b>beach</b> <b>ridges</b> and covering dunes. The ASD model specifies storm or fair-weather sand <b>beach</b> <b>ridges</b> forming at high-tide positions (on an annual basis at minimum), which acted as deflationary sources for landward foredune development. Only a limited number of such late-Holocene <b>beach</b> <b>ridges</b> survive in the observed prograded series. <b>Beach</b> <b>ridges</b> only survive when capped by storm-generated gravel beaches that are deposited on a mesoscale time spacing of 50 ? 130 years. The morphodynamic shift from a dissipative beach face for dune formation to a reflective beach face for gravel capping appears to be controlled by the beach sand volume falling to a level where reflective conditions can prevail. Sediment volume entering the beach is thought to have fluctuated as a function of a forced regression associated with the falling sea level from the mid-Holocene highstand (ca. 6000 cal. yr BP) identified in north-east Ireland. The prograded <b>beach</b> <b>ridges</b> dated at ca. 3000 to 2000 cal. yr BP indicate that the Holocene highstand?s regressive phase may have lasted longer than previously specified.

As highlighted in the review, <b>beach</b> <b>ridges</b> can develop by a variety of processes depending upon the location and the prevailing climatic and oceanographic conditions. One of the types of <b>beach</b> <b>ridges,</b> the medium to coarse-grained sand <b>beach</b> <b>ridges</b> along the northeast Australian coast, has been suggested by Nott et al. (2009) to be deposited by waves and surge during tropical cyclones and as such register a millennial scale record of these events. Tamura (2012) suggests that they could have been deposited by wind, presumably because they are composed of sand and not gravel, however the evidence as discussed here shows that Tamura (2012) is incorrect...|$|R

2500|$|The {{topography}} of Buffalo River/Bluestem Prairie largely formed beneath a proglacial lake {{at the end}} of the last glacial period. [...] The region had previously been covered and exposed many times by successive glaciations. [...] As the ice of the Wisconsin glaciation melted, the Red River Valley was covered by Glacial Lake Agassiz 10,000–8,000 years ago. [...] Fine sediments formed a level lakebed. [...] However beach ridges of sand and gravel formed in various places as the shorelines shifted. [...] There is a <b>beach</b> <b>ridge</b> on the east edge of the state park called Campbell Ridge, and another to the southeast in the SNA called Norcross Ridge. [...] The bedrock—a thin layer of shale over granite, slate, and schist—lies beneath [...] of silt deposited by Lake Agassiz. [...] The lake finally drained away to the north, leaving behind a distinctly flat plain with very rich soil.|$|E
2500|$|Haarlem has a {{rich history}} {{dating back to}} pre-medieval times, as it lies on a thin strip of land above sea level known as the strandwal (<b>beach</b> <b>ridge),</b> which connects Leiden to Alkmaar. The people on this narrow strip of land {{struggled}} against {{the waters of the}} North Sea from the west, and the waters of the IJ and the Haarlem Lake from the east. Haarlem became wealthy with toll revenues that it collected from ships and travellers moving on this busy North-South route. However, as shipping became increasingly important economically, the city of Amsterdam became the main Dutch city of North Holland during the Dutch Golden Age. The town of Halfweg became a suburb, and Haarlem became a quiet bedroom community, and for this reason Haarlem still has many of its central medieval buildings intact. Nowadays many of them are on the Dutch Heritage register known as Rijksmonuments. The [...] gives an overview of these per neighbourhood, with the majority in the old city centre.|$|E

30|$|The <b>beach</b> <b>ridges</b> in Northeast Queensland, Australia {{have been}} shown to {{accumulate}} through storm tide and wave action combined. The same is true for the ridges in the Gulf of Carpentaria and in Shark Bay, Western Australia (Nott and Forsyth 2012). Not all <b>beach</b> <b>ridges</b> elsewhere around Australia, particularly in southern, temperate Australia and globally, accumulate in the same fashion. Some can form through aeolian action although Hesp (2006) would now define these as relict foredunes, but there has been some confusion previously in the literature about terminology. Wind plays a minimal, if any, role {{in the formation of the}} <b>beach</b> <b>ridges</b> identified thus far as palaeo-TC deposits. In short, numerous post-TC event surveys reveal an absence of aeolian deposits resulting from the event (Nott and Forsyth 2012). In most situations examined so far, the only substantial deposits have been generated by marine inundations. Coral shingle ridges can be deposited in their entirety during a single TC event (Nott 2003; Maragos et al. 1973), but the coarse-grained sand <b>beach</b> <b>ridges</b> appear to accumulate progressively over time.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>beach</b> <b>ridge</b> is a wave-swept or wave-deposited ridge running {{parallel}} to a shoreline. It is commonly composed of sand {{as well as}} sediment worked from underlying beach material. The movement of sediment by wave action is called littoral transport. Movement of material {{parallel to}} the shoreline is called longshore transport. Movement perpendicular to the shore is called on-offshore transport. A <b>beach</b> <b>ridge</b> may be capped by, or associated with, sand dunes. The height of a <b>beach</b> <b>ridge</b> is affected by wave size and energy.|$|E

40|$|Reports {{describing}} aeolian foredunes and wave-derived <b>beach</b> <b>ridges</b> juxtaposed {{within a}} single coastal barrier complex are rare, perhaps because morphological similarities make the two ridge types difficult to differentiate. This study of an approximately 4500 year-old sand ridge plain in northeast Queensland, Australia using landform morphology, sedimentology and luminescence chronology suggests that ridge plain development here has been interrupted along part of the sequence by localised alterations in coastal sedimentation. A switch from coarse to fine-grained sand supply along {{one part of the}} beach has caused the development of prograding foredunes in the northeastern sector of the sequence over the past 700 years. Contemporaneously, coarser textured <b>beach</b> <b>ridges</b> have continued to form behind the remainder of the beach. The result is a 'complex barrier' where a single ridge plain contains both foredunes developed through high frequency, low intensity events and <b>beach</b> <b>ridges</b> developed through high intensity, low frequency events associated with intense tropical cyclones...|$|R
