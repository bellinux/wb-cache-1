40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to develop a}} normative capital maintenance model for depreciable assets during a time of inflation. This model is developed on a stipulated physical capital maintenance concept that accumulated depreciation {{at the end of an}} asset 2 Ì† 7 s useful life should be equal to the funds required to replace the asset with a new one of comparable capacity. The soundness of this stipulation is supported by analyses of widely publicized theoretical models and promulgations of standards setting bodies in several countries. A key innovative factor in the model is provision for <b>backlog</b> <b>depreciation</b> as a charge against income. <b>Backlog</b> <b>depreciation</b> is the difference between the depreciation charges that would otherwise be made over the life of the asset and its net replacement cost. The model is developed first for a simple situation where depreciable assets are purchased from a local market. This permits demonstration of the efficacy of <b>backlog</b> <b>depreciation</b> and other somewhat innovative factors. Cognizance is then taken of the following features of the international trade for depreciable assets: (a) the country that is self-sufficient in depreciable assets does not exist in contemporary economic life, (b) different countries experience different inflation rates, and (c) the exchange rates between currencies fluctuate through time. The model is, accordingly, extended to cope with depreciable assets purchased from a foreign country by adding: (1) the price increase of the asset in a foreign market, and (2) the changes in the exchange rates between currencies as two vital dimensions in the model. Each of the following situations involving foreign exchange and acquisition of depreciable assets from another country is analyzed under the extended model: (1) forward exchange rate with fixed or certain prices, (2) forward exchange rate with uncertain changing prices, and (3) current spot trade with uncertain changing prices. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{franchising}} {{of public}} service activities (concessions de service public) has traditionally {{played a significant role}} in infrastructural provision in France, notably in the public utility sectors of electricity, gas and water. Concession accounting is troubled by two major problems. First, operating capability maintenance (OCM) is not achieved, primarily because of the failure to tackle the issue of <b>backlog</b> <b>depreciation.</b> In sectors with high capital intensity, long asset lives and marked technological change, the restrictive legislation pertaining to asset revaluation and, hence, depreciation, aggravates this OCM problem. Second, financial capital maintenance (FCM) is not achieved, particularly when amortization of the enterprise's investment in those concession assets which are surrendered to public authorities (I'amortissement de caducite) is abandoned. This evaluation of French practice is policy relevant for two distinct reasons. First, given the significance of concessions in France, it is important to establish a coherent translation of the principles of the Plan comptable general 1982 to concession assets; this will not be achieved by the proposals of the 1992 Committee on Concessions, whose implementation would represent a retreat from economic relevance. Second, the concession model is experiencing both a revival in francophone Africa and extension to the United Kingdom. ...|$|E
