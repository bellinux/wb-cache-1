40|$|Although various {{deformations}} may {{be noted}} on netting, {{when it is}} set into the flowing water, it is not impossible to regard {{a small portion of}} the netting as a plane. It is proper for us to make clear the fluid dynamic properties of the netting, by using a simplified net-models. For the purpose of this, it was planned to make the knotless plane net-models, using vinyl-chloride cylindrical-bar instead of <b>netting</b> <b>twine.</b> In this paper, some descriptions were made comparative experiments on netting materials consisting of the vinyl-chloride cylindrical-bar, and the cremona <b>netting</b> <b>twine.</b> The measurements were carried out with the hand-made equipment, which was capable of measuring simultaneously both the dragging component and the lifting component to be derived from the netting material, when they were set into the flowing water. The drag-coefficient C_D, the lift-coefficient C_L, and friction-coefficient C_F are to be calculated from the measured values of C_Dm and C_Lm as in the following formulae：－ ･･･[the rest omitted...|$|R
50|$|Netting is a {{technique}} which involves braiding natural tresses under a thin, breathable net {{that serves as a}} flat surface onto which stylists can weave extensions. This method requires the use of hair net or cap to be placed over the person's hair that has been <b>braided.</b> <b>Netting</b> provides more flexibility than track placement because the stylist is not limited to sewing extensions to a <b>braid.</b> With <b>netting</b> there is the option of sewing the hair wefts onto the net or gluing.

40|$|In recent years, the {{tendency}} in some {{sectors of the}} fishing industry has been to use thicker and stiffer twines {{in the manufacture of}} netting material. This increases the mesh’s resistance to opening and, consequently, reduces the selective performance of fishing gears. The main characteristic of <b>netting</b> <b>twine</b> contributing to mesh resistance to opening is flexural rigidity (EI). We present a methodology for quantifying mesh resistance to opening {{through the use of a}} prototype called the resistance to opening and deflection meter (ROD-m). It incorporates four tension load cells and four stepping motors that are driven by four ministep bipolar chopper drives. Small panels of netting (3 3 meshes) can be mounted on ROD-m, which can measure the forces acting on the netting and the position of the knots. Estimates of the flexural rigidity of the <b>netting</b> <b>twine</b> can be made from these data. We present the results of the analysis of Mediterranean polyamide netting, and standard and Brezline polyethylene (PE) netting from the North Sea. In all netting, regardless of the material used, EI increases with increasing linear density. Furthermore, Brezline is much stiffer than standard green PE, although they are equally thick...|$|R

In the present study, a model cage was fabricated and tested in a towing tank under different waves and current load conditions. The tension on the mooring chain was measured during the experimental study, besides the towing speed and wave parameters. Based on the experimental data, drag coefficient for the cage <b>net</b> <b>twine</b> was estimated. The tensions in the mooring chain and the cage <b>net</b> <b>twine</b> of the prototype cage were predicted based on the model data.

The force on the net was more than 1. 7 times the force on the floating collar and sinker pipe. The tension in the mooring line is mainly due to the force on the net. Further {{it was observed that}} the force on the net due to current was 10 times higher than that due to wave.

The resulting retention rates of juvenile seabream were 15 - 35 % lower for the low-contrast codend with PA monofilament than for the high contrast PE <b>twine</b> <b>netting</b> under bright and dim light conditions, while no difference was observed under dark conditions. The effects of mesh size and netting contrast on the retention rate were dependent on the light level, while the retention rate due to netting contrast was independent of mesh size.

40|$|Trap gear such as {{set nets}} and pots are usually {{operated}} to fix {{on the sea}} bottom for several weeks. In order to be clear function changes in trap gear frameworks of this thesis were consisted of the following three steps by fishing gear constructions. 1) The <b>netting</b> <b>twines</b> consisted of the fundamental part of a fishing gear may be changed the breaking strength and elongation. 2) The nettings consisted of the minimum unit of function of capture. 3) Pot fishing gears are considered to the simplest model of an actual fishing gear. On the other hand, {{it is important for}} establishing and carrying out of environment-friendly to improve the fishing technology. In fact, trap gear are well-known as never-overfishing gear. It has never studied to be clear the function changes in trap gear during operations. In the present study, the function changes in trap gear were studied with using material engineering and hydrodynamical methods. The results obtaind can be summarized as follows: 1. The breaking strength and elongation of <b>netting</b> <b>twines</b> after soaked in the sea more than three years were measured. Nylon and polyethylene <b>netting</b> <b>twines</b> having thickness of 220 - 1980 denier were used. The breaking strength and elongation were sharply decreased for the first 1 year after soaked in the sea, and became a constant during 2 - 3 years. The retained breaking strength and elongation after 3 years of all test <b>netting</b> <b>twines</b> were about 70 % and 40 - 60 %, respectivly. 2. An encrusted condition of marine foulings on nettings for set nets which consider influence to measure a drag on the fouled plane netting by marine foulings were measured. The test netings were soaked around a set net fishing ground during the periods from 15 to 60 days and some water depthes (1. 5 to 15 m). The test netting consisted of polyester multi-filaments (0. 85 mm in diameter and 17 mm in bar length), which is commonly used for the set net fishing gear. The main marine foulings are fine attaching materials so-called "Nuta", Amphipoda, a kind of hydrozoans Tubulalia mesembryanthemum and a kind of moss animals Bugula neritina. 3. The drag per 1 m² for each test net at the right attack angle and 0. 5 m/s in flow velocity was from 3. 7 kgw to 19. 3 kgw. The changing ratio of drag varied from 1. 4 times to 8. 5 times against the initial (unused) netting. The mean ratio of drag on each soaking period, however, peaked 6. 5 times of the 30 th day net and then it scarcely changed till 60 th day net. 3. The drag per 1 m 2 for each test net at the right attack angle and 0. 5 m/s in flow velocity was from 3. 7 kgw to 19. 3 kgw. The changing raito of the drag varied from 1. 4 times to 8. 5 times against the unused net. However, the mean raito og drag on each soaking period peaked 6. 5 times of 30 days in soaking periods and then it scarcely changed till 60 days. The porosity (β) of the nettings before and after fouling changed from 76 to 16 %. The drag coefficient (CD) of fouled nettings can be expressed by the following equation; CD= 35. 98 (Rh) ⁻⁰. ⁴³(1. 7 × 10 ²<Rh< 1. 8 × 10 ³), where Rh is Reynolds number based on hydraulic mean depth of a fouled netting. However, the drag coefficient may be rather influenced the porosity for Rh< 5 × 10 ². The drag coefficient (CD) of a fouled netting was determined to be 1. 3 at 0. 6 <β< 0. 8 and 2. 2 atβ< 0. 5, respectively. The results suggest that the drag coefficient of a fouled netting is determined by its porosity. 4. To evaluate the preferable fishing ground for cuttlefish basket traps from bottom condition and CPUE (kg/trap/day) at two different fishing grounds (off Ariake and off Fukae) in Shimabara sound. The Md φ of off Ariake and off Fukae weres - 0. 3 to 3. 0 and 1. 0 to 1. 5, which were limited range against the whole Shimabara Sound (- 5. 4 to 5. 6). CPUE of off Fukae was 2 -fold greater than that of off Ariake. The significance of differences in CPUE between two fishing grounds was verified by taken together Mann-Whitney test (p< 0. 05). The results suggest that the medium sandy se﻿a bottom is more preferable for capturing of golden cuttlefish by the cuttlefish basket trap. 5. Catches were high at water temperature between 12 - 14 ℃. Daily catches varied periodically due to the change in the lunar cycle, and it became maximum at neap tide, or ebb, and minimum at spring tide. In this region, water temperature seems to be an important long-term factor affecting the main fishing period, and tidal current seems to be an important short-term factor controlling daily catch. The amount of catch might be controlled by both water temperature and tidal current, which is therefore the important factors in the cuttlefish basket trap fishery...|$|R
