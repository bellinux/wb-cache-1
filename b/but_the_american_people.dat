500|$|McCain was a {{supporter}} of the Euromaidan protests against the elected Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his government, and appeared in Independence Square in Kiev in December 2013. Following the overthrow of Yanukovych and subsequent 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, McCain became a vocal supporter of providing arms to Ukrainian military forces, saying the sanctions imposed against Russia were not enough. [...] In 2014, McCain led the opposition to the appointments of Colleen Bell, Noah Mamet, and George Tsunis to the ambassadorships in Hungary, Argentina, and Norway, respectively, arguing they were unqualified appointees being rewarded for their political fundraising. [...] Unlike many Republicans, McCain supported the release and contents of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture in December 2014, saying [...] "The truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow. It sometimes causes us difficulties at home and abroad. It is sometimes used by our enemies in attempts to hurt us. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> are entitled to it, nonetheless." [...] He added that the CIA's practices following the September 11 attacks had [...] "stained our national honor" [...] while doing [...] "much harm and little practical good" [...] and that [...] "Our enemies act without conscience. We must not." [...] He opposed the Obama administration's December 2014 decision to normalize relations with Cuba.|$|E

The two were cordial, but McCain would get that forced smile on his face whenever they were together." [...] McCain also campaigned for about forty Republican House of Representatives candidates, and was credited by National Republican Congressional Committee chair Tom Davis with keeping the House in Republican hands. [...] McCain would state that he voted for Bush on November 7 (although years later several witnesses would relate that McCain and his wife Cindy had both said at a dinner party that they had not). [...] When the November presidential election continued on in indecision during the Florida election dispute, McCain stayed generally quiet in an atmosphere of extreme partisanship, though he did appear on CBS' Face the Nation to say, [...] "I think the nation is growing a little weary of this. [...] We're not in a constitutional crisis, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> are growing weary, and whoever wins is having a rapidly diminishing mandate, to say the least." [...] Once Bush was declared the winner and inaugurated in January 2001, McCain's battles with him would resume, with a significant amount of lingering bitterness between the two men and their staffs over what had transpired during the course of 2000.|$|E

50|$|Washington {{provides}} {{strong support}} for a balanced federal budget, arguing that the nation's credit is {{an important source of}} strength and security. He urges <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> to preserve <b>the</b> national credit by avoiding war, avoiding unnecessary borrowing, and paying off any national debt accumulated in times of war as quickly as possible in times of peace so that future generations do not have to take on the financial burdens that others have taken on themselves. Despite his warnings to avoid taking on debt, Washington does state his belief that sometimes it is necessary to spend money to prevent dangers or wars that will in the end cost more if not properly prepared for. At these times, he argues, it is necessary for the people to cooperate by paying taxes created to cover these precautionary expenses. He emphasizes how important it is for the government to be careful in choosing the items that will be taxed, <b>but</b> also reminds <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> that, no matter how hard the government tries, there will never be a tax which is not inconvenient, unpleasant, or seemingly an insult to those who must pay it.|$|R
5000|$|Other Republicans were {{critical}} of Obama. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan said Obama mischaracterized Republicans’ position on federal entitlement programs. “No one {{is suggesting that}} what we call our earned entitlements - entitlements you pay for, like payroll taxes for Medicare and Social Security - are putting you in a ‘taker’ category." [...] Ryan contended that Obama made a “switcheroo” in his speech by suggesting that Republicans have referred to beneficiaries of those programs as “takers.” In reality, he said, that term refers to recipients of welfare and other non-“earned” entitlements. U.S. Senator Mike Lee, a frequent Obama critic, expressed his opinion that Obama chose not to unite <b>the</b> country, <b>but</b> to divide <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> “This is not the approach of a leader attempting to find solutions to problems <b>but</b> rather <b>the</b> tactics of a partisan trying to pick political fights. His vision {{for the next four}} years is clear: defend a broken system, ignore the fiscal crisis, and drive future generations further into debt.” Other Republicans like John McCain ("I didnt hear any conciliatory remarks") and [...] "pundits from the D.C. establishment" [...] also complained about Obamas speech. The Washington Posts Dana Milbank, for example, wrote that Obamas address [...] "was less an inaugural address for the ages than a leftover campaign speech combined with an early draft of the State of the Union address." ...|$|R

In January 2006, Belafonte led a delegation of activists including actor Danny Glover and activist/professor Cornel West to meet with President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez. In 2005, Chávez, an outspoken Bush critic, initiated a program to provide cheaper heating oil for poor people in several areas of the United States. Belafonte supported this initiative. He was quoted as saying, during the meeting with Chávez, [...] "No matter what the greatest tyrant in the world, the greatest terrorist in the world, George W. Bush says, we're here to tell you: Not hundreds, not thousands, <b>but</b> millions of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> support your revolution." [...] Belafonte and Glover met again with Chávez in 2006. The comment ignited a great deal of controversy. Hillary Clinton refused to acknowledge Belafonte's presence at an awards ceremony that featured both of them. AARP, which had just named him one of its 10 Impact Award honorees 2006, released this statement following the remarks: [...] "AARP does not condone the manner and tone which he has chosen and finds his comments completely unacceptable." [...] During a Martin Luther King Jr. Day speech at Duke University in 2006, Belafonte compared <b>the</b> <b>American</b> government to <b>the</b> hijackers of the September 11 attacks, saying: [...] "What is the difference between that terrorist and other terrorists?" [...] In response to criticism about his remarks Belafonte asked, [...] "What do you call Bush when the war he put us in to date has killed almost as many Americans as died on 9/11 and <b>the</b> number of <b>Americans</b> wounded in war is almost triple? [...] By most definitions Bush can be considered a terrorist." [...] When he was asked about his expectation of criticism for his remarks on the war in Iraq, Belafonte responded: [...] "Bring it on.

While the commission was originally proposed by the U.S. to develop an international consensus on the future make up and status of post-World War I Middle East nations, the commission quickly became a U.S.-only sponsored effort. With the appointment of Crane as co-head of the commission, it set about to issue a report to inform U.S. policy makers. In respect to the creation of a Jewish state in the Middle East, the report cautioned [...] "Not only you as president <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> as a whole should realize that if the American government decided to support the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, they are committing the American people to the use of force in that area, since only by force can a Jewish state in Palestine be established or maintained."

5000|$|The Commission Report {{was skeptical}} of the {{viability}} of a Jewish state in [...] "Syria".

It pointed out {{that a majority of}} [...] "Syrians" [...] were against the formation of a Jewish state. It concluded {{that the only way to}} establish a viable Jewish state would be with armed force to enforce it. This was precisely what the Commission wanted to avoid, so they dismissed the idea, saying that Zionists anticipated [...] "a practically complete dispossession of the present non-Jewish inhabitants to Palestine, by various forms of purchase". That said, there would be nothing wrong with Jews coming to [...] "Israel" [...] and simply living as Jewish Syrian citizens, but noted [...] "nor can the erection of such a Jewish State be accomplished without the gravest trespass upon the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine".
