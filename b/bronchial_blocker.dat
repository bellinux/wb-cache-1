50|$|An <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker</b> (also called endobronchial blocker) is {{a device}} {{which can be}} {{inserted}} down a tracheal tube after tracheal intubation so as to block off the right or left main bronchus of the lungs {{in order to be}} able to achieve a controlled one sided ventilation of the lungs in thoracic surgery. The lung tissue distal to the obstruction will collapse, thus allowing the surgeon's view and access to relevant structures within the thoracic cavity.|$|E
50|$|The {{instrumentation}} for VATS {{includes the}} use of a camera-linked 5 mm or 10 mm fiber-optic scope, with or without a 30-degree angle of visualization, and either conventional thoracic instruments or laparoscopic instruments. Unlike with laparoscopy, carbon dioxide insufflation is not generally required with VATS due to the inherent vault-like shape of the thoracic cavity. However, lung deflation {{on the side of the}} chest where VATS is being performed is a must to be able to visualize and pass instruments into the thorax; this is usually effected with a double-lumen endo-tracheal tube that allows for single lung ventilation or a <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker</b> delivered via a standard single-lumen endotracheal tube.|$|E

40|$|Airway {{management}} during carinal resection {{should provide}} adequate ventilation and oxygenation {{as well as}} a good surgical field, but without complications such as barotraumas or aspiration. One method of airway management is high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) of one lung or both lungs. We describe a patient undergoing carinal resection, who was managed with HFJV of one lung, using a de-ballooned <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker</b> of a Univent tube without cardiopulmonary compromise.

40|$|Introduction: Thoracoscopic {{surgical}} procedures in small {{infants and children}} require a growing demand for lung isolation in pediatric anesthesia practice. Materials and Methods: Between January 2006 and September 2014, 16 children underwent thoracoscopic procedures that needed one-lung ventilation using a <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker.</b> Results: The thoracoscopic procedure was performed at {{a mean age of}} 99 months (range, 6 - 186 months) and a mean weight of 33 kg (range, 7 - 68 kg) without any conversion to open surgery in any case. We were able to achieve one-lung ventilation in all patients. The quality of lung deflation was excellent in all patients except in 1 due to malposition of the <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker,</b> whereas dislodgement of this device occurred in 2 cases.

40|$|SUMMARY – The {{number of}} {{indications}} for lung collapse during different procedures is ri-sing. Difficult upper airway {{is more often}} encountered {{with the need for}} single lung ventilation. In patients with difficult airway, the safest approach is by placing a single-lumen endotracheal tube {{with the aid of a}} flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope. Lung isolation in these patients is then achieved by means of a <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker.</b> An alternative technique is exchanging the single-lumen for a double-lumen tube using an airway exchange catheter. When there is a tracheostomy in place, an independent <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker</b> is recommended...|$|E
40|$|T echniques for one-lung {{ventilation}} (OLV) can beaccomplished in {{two different}} ways. The firstinvolves {{the use of a}} double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT). The second method involves blockade of a mainstem bronchus to allow lung collapse distal to the occlusion (<b>bronchial</b> <b>blockers)</b> (1 – 3). In 1936, Magill (4) achieved bronchial blockade using a long tube with an inflatable cuff at its distal end that was advanced alongside a single-lumen endotracheal tube. Since then, more devices have been introduced including: 1) the Fogarty vascular embolectomy catheter (5) [Ed...|$|R

40|$|Bronchogenic cyst, {{a benign}} {{congenital}} cystic lesion of the lung, {{is a rare}} cause of respiratory distress in children comprising 7. 5 % of all mediastinal masses. A thorough preoperative evaluation is crucial to plan for definitive intra- and post-operative management. All patients should be thoroughly evaluated {{for the presence of}} compression, deviation or distortion of airways and great veins. The easiest means of providing one lung ventilation in pediatrics is to intubate the main stem bronchus of the nonoperated lung. Other options available for pediatric one lung ventilation are single lumen endobronchial tubes, micro cuff tubes, Marraro bilumen tubes, and <b>bronchial</b> <b>blockers.</b> We hereby present a case report of a 2 -month-old infant posted for excision of bronchogenic cyst along with a review of literature...|$|R
40|$|Lung {{isolation}} can {{be accomplished}} in two ways: the first, a double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) and the second, a <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker</b> (Univent ® or Arndt® blocker). Previous {{studies have found that}} the DLT and the Univent ® are comparable when providing lung isolation. A new <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker,</b> the wire-guided endobronchial blocker (Arndt ® blocker), has been introduced. However, there is no study to report its effectiveness with lung isolation during elective thoracic surgical cases. Therefore, we designed a pro-spective, randomized trial to compare the effective-ness of lung isolation among the 3 endotracheal tubes: the left-sided DLT Broncho-Cath ® Group A (...|$|E
30|$|Options {{alternative}} to this tube include a right-sided DLT [5], a <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker</b> inserted through a single-lumen tube or DLT [5], and a single-lumen wire-reinforced tube {{placed in the}} left main bronchus [12]. However, the single-lumen tube is cumbersome to use because its withdrawal and advancement under bronchoscopic guidance must be repeated during inflation-deflation cycles repeated {{for the assessment of}} surgical air leaks. Right-sided DLTs are more difficult to position for adequate lung isolation and ventilation of the right upper lobe, compared with left-sided DLTs [12, 13]. With a <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker,</b> deflation of the isolated lung is slower and suctioning beyond the blocker is less effective, compared with DLTs [13]. An endobronchial cuff of a right-sided DLT or <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker</b> is easier to dislodge during surgical manipulation of the right lung, compared with left-sided DLTs [13]. Therefore, the Silbroncho® left-sided DLT seemed a suitable option, although bronchoscopic guidance is more frequently required for its correct placement, e.g., by preventing intra-tracheal kinking of its flexible bronchial port, compared with standard DLTs [14].|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Insertion of endotracheal tubes, {{especially}} {{large and}} relatively inflexible double-lumen tubes, provokes cardiovascular and humoral responses {{which can cause}} complications. Bronchial blockers, combined with conventional single-lumen tubes (SLT), serve as alternatives to double-lumen tubes (DLT) and may provoke less hemodynamic response. Methods: Forty adults scheduled for elective thoracic surgery requiring single-lung ventilation {{were randomly assigned to}} DLT or SLT combined with EZ-Blocker (EZ), a <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker.</b> Heart rate and arterial blood pressure were recorded before induction of anesthesia, before laryngoscopy, after laryngoscopy, and one minute after intubation. Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol serum concentrations were assessed one minute after intubation. Results: Pre-laryngoscopy values were comparable in both groups. Mean arterial pressure significantly increased in both groups during intubation. The maximum value during intubation was significantly higher with DLT (121 ± 17 mmHg), compared to <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker</b> (105 ± 18 mmHg, P= 0. 022). Heart rate increased significantly during intubation in both groups (DLT from 68 ± 9 to 86 ± 11, P< 0. 001, <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker</b> from 72 ± 11 to 87 ± 16, P= 0. 002), but the increase did not differ between the groups (P= 0. 76). Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol serum concentrations did not increase significantly from baseline values and did not differ between the treatment groups. Conclusion: Insertion of DLT increases blood pressure more than placement of a SLT combined with <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker.</b> However, the difference is probably not clinically important. Furthermore, {{there were no significant differences}} in heart rate or catecholamine concentrations. Clinicians should consider other factors when choosing between airway options for single-lung ventilation...|$|E
40|$|Background: One-lung {{ventilation}} (OLV) {{is necessary}} for selected surgical settings and medical conditions. Different methods have been described and used to isolate 1 lung, including the double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) {{and a variety of}} <b>bronchial</b> <b>blockers</b> (BBs). This selection is often based on the preferences and experiences of the anesthesiologist and surgeon. Complications associated with OLV isolation tubes have been previously described, but complications specifically associated with the Cohen BB (CBB) (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) have not been investigated. The purpose of this retrospective review was to determine the incidence of vocal cord injury, tracheobronchial injury, and hoarseness in adult patients who underwent OLV with the CBB. Methods: We reviewed electronic anesthesia records, operative dictation, and inpatient progress notes to collect information about vocal cord injury, bronchial injury, hoarseness, and sore throat for adults who underwent surgical and diagnostic procedures requiring OLV. Secondary endpoints were types of surgical procedures, degree of difficulty with orotracheal intubation, ability of the patient to tolerate extubation in the operating room, and whether the thoracic surgeon deemed the lung separation adequate. ...|$|R
40|$|The first {{minimally}} invasive procedure reported using thoracoscopic techniques was a lung biopsy. Lung biopsy is generally utilized to provide answers for causes of interstitial lung disease in both the immunocompetent and immunocompromised child, lung residual masses after chemotherapy and evaluation of new suspicious nodules found in oncology patients. Interstitial lung disease is defined as diffuse interstitial findings on chest x-ray or CT scan. Interstitial disease may be bilateral or unilateral and may be more prominent in one lobe over another. Posterior pleural biopsies are performed with the patient almost prone and anterior lesions are performed with the patient almost supine. Thus, positioning takes advantage of gravity to allow the lung to fall away from the lesion when the lung is collapsed. Instead of single lung ventilation children can benefit from undergoing contralateral lung ventilation using ipsilateral <b>bronchial</b> <b>blockers</b> or Fogarty balloon catheters. Use of CO 2 insufflation creates a pneumothorax and further collapses the ipsilateral lung. Pressures of 4 - 6 mm should be utilized. The lung biopsy can be performed with endoloop or endoscopic staplers. Image-guided percutaneous needle biopsy is preferred for pulmonary nodules. Thoracoscopy reduces pain, shortens hospital stay and is more pleasing cosmetically...|$|R
40|$|Background: Confirmation of {{placement}} of Double lumen endobronchial tubes (DLETT) and <b>bronchial</b> <b>blockers</b> (BBs) with the pediatric fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) {{is the most}} preferred practice worldwide. Most centers possess standard adult FOBs, some, particularly in developing countries might {{not have access to}} the pediatric-sized devices. We have evaluated the role of preintubation airway assessment using the former, measuring the distance from the incisors to the carina and from carina to the left and right upper lobe bronchus in deciding the depth of insertion of the lung isolation device. Methods: The study was a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial consisting of 84 patients (all > 18 years) undergoing thoracic surgery over a 12 -month period. In the study group (n = 38), measurements obtained during FOB with the adult bronchoscope decided the depth of insertion of the lung isolation device. In the control group (n = 46), DLETTs and BBs were placed blindly followed by clinical confirmation by auscultation. Selection of the type and size of the lung isolation device was at the discretion of the anesthesiologist conducting the case. In all cases, pediatric FOB was used to confirm accurate placement of devices. Results: Of 84 patients (DLETT used in 76 patients; BB used in 8 patients), preintubation airway measurements significantly improved the success rate of optimal placement of lung isolation device from 25 % (11 / 44) to 50 % (18 / 36) (P = 0. 04). Our incidence of failed device placement at initial insertion was 4. 7 % (4 / 84). Incidence of malposition was 10 % (8 / 80) with 4 cases in each group. The incidence of suboptimal placement was lower in the study group at 38. 9 % (14 / 36) versus 65. 9 % (29 / 44). Conclusions: Preintubation airway measurements with the adult FOB reduces airway manipulations and improves the success rate of optimal placement of DLETT and BB...|$|R

40|$|Massive {{air leakage}} through a lacerated lung {{produces}} inadequate ventilation and hypoxemia.

In this case report, {{we aim to}} describe how a <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker</b> (BB) {{makes it easier to}} perform a lung separation in this situation; it also increases the overall safety of the procedure. A 35 -year-old female (163 cm, 47 kg) suf-fered from blunt chest trauma due to a traffic accident; the accident caused right-sided lung laceration with massive air leakage. Paradoxically, positive ventilation worsened SaO 2 and leakage increased through a chest tube. We introduced BB while the patient was still awake: Left-side one-lung ventilation (OLV) was established and anesthesia was induced. After PaO 2 was maximized with OLV, we changed the endotracheal tube to DLT without a hypoxic event. By BB placement, we maintained PaO 2 at a secure level, conducted mechanical ventilation and exchanged the tube without deterioration.

40|$|Background: Minimal {{invasive}} surgeries {{are carried}} out to benefit the patient with less pain, blood loss, mechanical ventilation and hospital stay; a smaller scar is not the aim. Minimal invasive cardiac surgeries {{are carried out}} via small sternotomy, small thoracotomy and via robotic arms. Subxiphoid route is a novel method and avoids sternotomy. Aim: This case series {{is an attempt to}} understand the anesthetic modifications required. Secondly, whether it is feasible to carry out subxiphoid coronary artery bypass surgery. Methods: Elective patients scheduled to undergo subxiphoid coronary artery bypass surgery were chosen. The surgeries were conducted under general anesthesia with left lung isolation via either endobronchial tube or <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker.</b> Results: We conducted ten (seven males and 3 females) coronary artery bypass graft surgeries via subxiphoid technique. The mean EuroSCORE was 1. 7 and the mean ejection fraction was 53. 6. Eight patients underwent surgery via endobronchial tube, while, in the remaining two lung isolation was obtained using <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker.</b> Mean blood loss intraoperatively was 300 ± 42 ml and postoperatively 2000 ± 95 ml. The pain score on the postoperative day ′ 0 ′ was 4. 3 ± 0. 6 and 2. 3 ± 0. 7 on the day of discharge. Length of stay in the hospital was 4. 8 ± 0. 9 days. There were no complications, blood transfusions, conversion to cardiopulmonary bypass. The modifications in the anesthetic and surgical techniques are, use of left lung isolation using either endobronchial tube or <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker,</b> increased duration for conduit harvesting, grafting, requirement of transesophageal echocardiography monitoring in addition to hemodynamic monitoring. Other minor requirements are transcutaneous pacing and defibrillator pads, a wedge under the chest to ′lift′ up the chest, sparing right femoral artery and vein (to serve as vascular access) for an unlikely event of conversion to cardiopulmonary bypass. Any anesthesiologist wishing to start this technique must be aware of these modifications.

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, laser {{resection}} of lung metastases {{has been}} established as the standard procedure worldwide. To avoid airway fire, {{it is necessary to}} collapse the surgical lung. The selective lobar bronchial blockade is a technique that allows one-lung ventilation while the operated lobe is collapsed in patients with previous pulmonary resection requiring subsequent resection or with limited pulmonary reserved. We report a clinical case about our experience of a selective lobar bronchial blockade technique with a <b>bronchial</b> <b>blocker</b> (Coopdech endobronchial blocker) that was employed successfully with a double-lumen endotracheal tube in a patient with previous contralateral pulmonary resection who was scheduled for atypical resections of pulmonary metastases by laser.
