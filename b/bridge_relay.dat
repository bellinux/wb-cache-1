40|$|Privacy, {{including}} the right to privacy of correspondence, is a human right. Privacy-enhancing technologies, such as the Tor anonymity network, help maintain this right. The increasing use of Tor from mobile devices raises new challenges for the continued effectiveness of this low-latency anonymity network. Mobile Tor users may access the Internet from a range of wireless networks and service providers. Whenever a wireless network hands-off a mobile device’s connection from one access point to another, its external Internet Protocol (IP) address changes, and the connection to the Tor network is dropped. Every dropped connection requires the Tor circuit to be rebuilt. The time required to rebuild the circuit negatively impacts client performance. This research is the first to highlight this negative impact and to investigate the likely extent of the impact for typical usage scenarios and mobility models. The increased network churn caused by circuit rebuilding also negatively impacts anonymity. A novel metric (q-factor) is proposed here to measure the trade-off between anonymity and performance over the duration of a communication session. Two new solutions to the problems of managing mobility in a low-latency anonymity network are proposed in this thesis. The first solution relies on adaptive client throttling, based on a Kaplan-Meier estimator of the likelihood of a mobile network hand-off. The second solution relies on the use of a static <b>bridge</b> <b>relay</b> (mBridge) that acts as a persistent ‘home’ for a mobile Tor connection, so avoiding the need to recreate the Tor circuit whenever the mobile device is handed-off. The effectiveness of these solutions has been measured using the new q-factor metric. Both solutions provide better performance for mobile Tor clients than the standard Tor client implementation, although some performance reduction by comparison with static Tor clients remains. The <b>bridge</b> <b>relay</b> solution (mBridge) has been shown to offer better performance than client throttling, but is more vulnerable to certain types of attack. A strength of both solutions is that changes are restricted to client devices, the existing algorithms and protocols of the interior Tor network are unaffected...|$|E

25|$|Tor aims {{to conceal}} its users' identities and their online {{activity}} from surveillance and traffic analysis by separating identification and routing. It is an implementation of onion routing, which encrypts and then randomly bounces communications through {{a network of}} relays run by volunteers around the globe. These onion routers employ encryption in a multi-layered manner (hence the onion metaphor) to ensure perfect forward secrecy between relays, thereby providing users with anonymity in network location. That anonymity extends to the hosting of censorship-resistant content by Tor's anonymous hidden service feature. Furthermore, by keeping some of the entry <b>relays</b> (<b>bridge</b> <b>relays)</b> secret, users can evade Internet censorship that relies upon blocking public Tor relays.|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} {{wireless}} mobile devices connecting to the Internet, {{is predicted to}} surpass static connections by 2014. A desire for privacy will provide additional challenges in the future, for anonymity networks such as Tor, in supporting this increasing mobile user base.

An experiment was undertaken to simulate a mobile user at various mobility speeds (e. g. walking) alongside a range of Tor circuit build times. The {{results show that the}} impact to the mobile user (and potentially the overall Tor network) was significant when roaming between networks, and as expected, increased with higher mobility speeds and longer circuit build times. We also reviewed previous related research and, as one potential solution, considered whether <b>Bridge</b> <b>Relays</b> could additionally be used to provide a persistent connection to the Tor network, for roaming mobile users.

The main function of the ALAX is to provide an interface between legacy LAN and ATM world giving network managers the option of gradually integrating ATM technology into their existing networks. To provide this functionality to the ALAX system, we decided to implement {{two versions of the}} ALAX system. One is the LAN emulation version and the other is the Multi Protocol Over ATM version. The most important design characteristics of the ALAX is the adoption of the IEEE P 1355 Standard for Heterogeneous Inter Connect (HIC) [1] as the data communication paths within the ALAX switching system. This makes it possible to design the PC- based parallel architectured high performance switching system in conformance with emerging open technologies and related standards. The protocols needed within the LAN Emulation version of the ALAX include LAN Emulation, <b>Bridging</b> <b>Relay</b> function, P 1355, MAC Mapping Layer (MML), MAC, LAN Physical, AAL 5, ATM and ATM Physical Layer.

The details of all these protocols, the relationship among these protocols and the implementations of these protocols are described in this document. <P...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—As current Tor <b>bridges</b> and <b>relays</b> can {{be easily}} {{identified}} and blocked, it is critical for Tor users {{to be able to}} connect the Tor service. In this paper, we propose a novel Cloud-Entry service for Tor to address this issue by utilizing the unique characteristics of cloud services. As our first step, we have built a prototype pluggable transport, called GTor on the Google App Engine (GAE) platform, to help a Tor client to connect a Tor relay/bridge via a Google web application. This service is hard to identify and block, and thus also hides Tor users in cloud traffic. Furthermore, it makes identifying bridges a difficult task. Moreover, it naturally provides better performance with cloud resources. More importantly, it is scalable with the cloud service capacity. Our initial implementation and evaluations have demonstrated its effectiveness, and we are improving the scheme by developing cloud-based relays. We have made our GTor implementation available online. I...|$|R
40|$|Tor is {{currently}} the most popular network for anonymous Internet access. It critically relies on volunteer nodes called <b>bridges</b> for <b>relaying</b> Internet traffic when a user's ISP blocks connections to Tor. Unfortunately, current methods for distributing bridges are vulnerable to malicious users who obtain and block bridge addresses. In this paper, we propose TorBricks, a protocol for distributing Tor bridges to n users, even when an unknown number t < n of these users are controlled by a malicious adversary. TorBricks distributes O(tlog(n)) bridges and guarantees that all honest users can connect to Tor with high probability after O(log(t)) rounds of communication with the distributor. We also extend our algorithm to perform privacy-preserving bridge distribution when run among multiple untrusted distributors. This not only prevents the distributors from learning bridge addresses and bridge assignment information, but also provides resistance against malicious attacks from a m/ 3 fraction of the distributors, where m {{is the number of}} distributors.

This paper proposes a novel and flexible SRM fault-tolerant topology with fault diagnosis, fault tolerance and advanced control functions. The converter {{is composed of}} a single-phase <b>bridge</b> and a <b>relay</b> network, based on the traditional asymmetrical half bridge driving topology. When the SRM driving system is subjected to fault conditions including open-circuit and short circuit faults, the proposed converter starts its fault diagnosis procedure to locate the fault. Based on the relay network, the faulty part can be bypassed by the single-phase bridge arm while the single-phase bridge arm and the healthy part of the converter can form a fault-tolerant topology to sustain the driving operation. A fault-tolerant control strategy is developed to decrease {{the influence of the}} fault. Furthermore, the proposed fault tolerance strategy can be applied to three-phase 12 / 8 SRM and four-phase 8 / 6 SRM.
