40|$|Vehicle {{communications}} {{are becoming}} a reality, driven by navigation safety requirements and by the investments of car manufacturers and Public Transport Authorities. As a consequence many of the essential vehicle grid components (radios, Access Points, spectrum, standards, etc.) will soon be in place (and paid for) paving the way to unlimited opportunities for other car-to-car applications beyond safe navigation, for example, from news to entertainment, mobile network games and civic defense. In this study, we take a visionary look at these future applications, the emerging “Vehicular Grid ” that will support them and the interplay between the grid and the communications infrastructure. In essence, the Vehicular Grid is a large scale ad hoc network. However, an important feature of the Vehicular Grid, which sets it apart from most instantly-deployed ad hoc networks, is the ubiquitous presence of the infrastructure (and the opportunity to use it). While the Vehicular Grid must be entirely self-supporting for emergency operations (natural disaster, terrorist attack, etc), it should exploit the infrastructure (when present) during normal operations. In this paper we address the interaction between vehicles and Internet servers through Virtual Grid and Internet Infrastructure. This includes transparent geo-route provisioning across the Internet, mobile resource monitoring, and mobility management (using <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>services</b> in case of infrastructure failure). We then focus on routing and show the importance of Infrastructure cooperation and feedback for efficient, congestion free routing...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} conditions where, after initially negative plain x rays following trauma, there subsequently {{proves to}} be fracture, and to explore {{ways in which the}} management might be improved. DESIGN: A 16 month prospective study. Patient details were collected from accident and emergency (A&E) review clinics and returns, A&E ward admissions, correspondence from other services, and discussions at a weekly clinicoradiological conference. The inclusion criteria comprised A&E trauma patients with normal initial plain x rays and proven fractures on subsequent imaging for the same patient event. SETTING: A large A&E department seeing 65, 000 new attendances per annum with full <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>services.</b> RESULTS: 55 cases were identified: 41 fractures were identified on subsequent plain x ray, six on bone scan, six on CAT scan, and two on MRI scan. The commonest regions involved were the wrist, pelvis/hip, ankle/foot, and leg. Follow up had not been arranged at the initial attendance in 17 instances and between two and 135 days were required for definitive fracture recognition. All but nine patients required alteration in treatment because of fracture detection. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical suspicion of fracture at initial A&E attendance should prompt organised follow up {{even in the face of}} normal plain x rays. Consideration should be given to alternative imaging techniques which may have a higher resolution than plain x rays. Close corroboration between A&E and radiology departments has benefits in patient care in this group of patients and may lead to a reduction in functional disability and litigation...|$|R

40|$|Over {{one-third of}} the doctors in Sri Lanka are {{involved}} in the delivery of PHC. They form one of seven categories of PHC workers [...] others being the ayurveda physician, the assistant medical practitioner, nurse, midwife, traditional healer and unqualified practitioner. PHC workers function either in the government or private sector. Their functions in the PHC system are not defined and are dependent on state health policies and people's expectations of health care. The secondary and tertiary levels of the health system are managed by the government through a network of hospitals. These hospitals provide Western type health care facilities free to the people. Government PHC workers have access to referral facilities and <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>services</b> provided through this hospital system. Doctors functioning within the PHC system had neither undergraduate nor postgraduate training in PHC. Private general practitioners were the first to realise the need for training doctors in PHC. They sought and got government and university approval for postgraduate training in family practice. The family practice training programme is conducted by the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine of the University of Colombo. The course consists of educational and clinical components which could be completed in a minimum of 1 year or maximum of 4 years. Nine private general practitioners and 19 government medical officers registered for the course. Fifteen completed the course in 1 year. Family practice trained doctors will function in a PHC system in which the services provided are not coordinated. Changes in the PHC system are being considered. Government is proposing to establish health centres manned by doctors with sub-centres manned by lesser trained health workers. The medical profession has suggested a unified PHC system and a national health insurance scheme. The exact role of the family practice trained doctor in the country's PHC system cannot be defined. Family practice training should influence and be influenced by changes in the PHC system in Sri Lanka. ...|$|R
