5000|$|The saloon and {{estate car}} {{versions}} were produced in China by Shanghai GM as Buick Sail and Buick Sail S-RV, respectively from June 2001 to February 2005. That year {{they received a}} facelift and {{became known as the}} Chevrolet Sail and SRV. In September 2006, Chile became the first country outside China to receive the Chinese-assembled Sail; it is called the Chevrolet Corsa Plus, available as a four-door saloon with a 1.6 L [...] engine. The Corsa Plus includes dual front airbags, anti-lock <b>brakes,</b> air <b>conditioning,</b> electric windows and central locking as standard equipment.|$|R

50|$|The midibus {{version of}} the Igero lengths 8.5m and has a seating {{capacity}} of either 31 persons in the intercity version or 59 in the city version. They come equipped with MAN EURO 3 turbocharged diesel engines, developing 170 HP. The gearbox is from ZF and the suspensions are pneumatic. Standard features also include ABS/ASR <b>brakes</b> and air <b>conditioning</b> system.|$|R
50|$|The model range {{includes}} {{the norm for}} current Volkswagen models, from the Comfortline to the Trendline and Highline, whilst featuring an extensive list of extras that had now become norm in mid-sized small cars. Items such as ABS, power steering, front and side airbags and front and rear head restraints were standard on all models and ESP, <b>brake</b> assistance, air <b>conditioning,</b> satellite navigation etc. were optional on higher spec models.|$|R
50|$|The Peacekeeper II, {{a heavily}} {{modified}} version of the Peacekeeper, was being marketed to law enforcement agencies across the United States to fight increasingly well-armed criminals in high-crime areas. The Peacekeeper II, using a General Motors or Ford pickup truck chassis and auto parts, has automatic transmission, power steering and <b>brakes,</b> air <b>conditioning</b> and heat and four-wheel drive, as well as tires that can operate for up to 30 miles if punctured. Peacekeeper II armor is a half-inch thick. Cadillac Gage wanted to build 200 of the $170,000 Peacekeeper II vehicles a year. It takes 15 to 50 workers to build each one, according to Clay Moise, Textron's vice president of marine and combat vehicles. No Peacekeeper IIs were sold and it is no longer being offered.|$|R
50|$|The T1s {{had many}} of the same {{technical}} specifications of the H-series, including the same married pair configuration, and incorporated {{many of the}} design elements that had been refined throughout the H-series program. Each model in the H-series production run improved on the last, adding features such as a single-handle controller for acceleration and <b>braking,</b> air <b>conditioning,</b> a change from camshaft to chopper control, and regenerative braking. The T1 built on those advances (such as changing from a rotary-type to a fore-aft, joystick-type controller) while integrating new computer technology (analogous to the New Technology Train of the New York City Subway), creating a more modern train. The T-series were the first TTC cars to use AC propulsion, rather than DC propulsion as used in all previous rolling stock, all of which are now retired.|$|R
50|$|A {{road test}} {{report of the}} time noted that the car had gained 250 lb in weight with the fitting of the V8 {{in place of the}} {{previously}} used six-cylinder unit, despite the manufacturer's assurance that the engine weighed only 30 lb more than the older straight-six. Other contributions to the weight gain included heavier ventilated <b>brake</b> discs, air <b>conditioning,</b> fatter tyres, a new and stronger ZF gearbox as well as some extra bodywork beneath the front bumper.|$|R
50|$|The Y-block was {{ultimately}} superseded {{because of its}} inherent displacement limit. A quick reference to the engine specifications for 1955-57 shows the Ford V8s ahead of the Chevrolet counterparts in displacement, horsepower, and torque. However, the original architecture was very small and tight. The ever-increasing size and weight of the standard passenger car, the added parasitic losses for accessories (power steering, power <b>brakes</b> and air <b>conditioning),</b> cheap gasoline, and the horsepower race all caused Ford to outgrow its first OHV V8 engine.|$|R
25|$|With Kei {{car sales}} {{shrinking}} overall and the Cervo losing market share, sales were dropping precipitously. In February 1987 the second-generation Cervo received its {{third and final}} update. The Turbo was discontinued and the lineup rationalized to two versions, the sporty CS-G with a 5-speed manual and the lower grade CS-D with either a 4-speed manual or the 2-speed automatic. As further rationalization, all models now had roll-type safety belts (hitherto, CS and CS-D versions had come with fixed belts), front disc <b>brakes</b> and air <b>conditioning.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Series 1 was {{produced}} in both supercharged and normally aspirated versions (but supercharger was optional). Supercharged cars were also outfitted by the factory with larger brakes and a heavy duty clutch. Performance is in the [...] "supercar" [...] category with a 0-60 time at 3.2 seconds. Nicely optioned, Series 1 had power steering, power disc <b>brakes,</b> factory air <b>conditioning,</b> power windows, and an AM/FM/CD audio system. The convertible top folded away {{out of sight in}} a compartment located behind the cockpit. Some component cars were sold as a roadster with no convertible top.|$|R
5000|$|The X-90 used a 1.6 L I4 16-valve engine which {{produced}} [...] and was available with {{four wheel drive}} or rear wheel drive and either a 5-speed manual or automatic transmission. [...] The X-90 featured dual air bags, anti-lock <b>brakes,</b> optional air <b>conditioning</b> and a dealer-installed 6 disc CD changer. The suspension used MacPherson struts and coil springs in front and coil springs with wishbone and trailing links in the rear. A space saver spare wheel is stored in the trunk and space behind the two seats offers further cargo area.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were few}} styling changes during this time: {{a new one}} piece plastic grill and one piece {{aluminum}} bumpers introduced in 1979. These design changes were also shared with the Cherokee. After {{the introduction of the}} Cherokee, AMC began to move the Wagoneer upmarket, and that brought high demand from a new market segment. The [...] "Limited", more luxuriously equipped than the earlier Super Wagoneer, offered Quadra-Trac, power disk <b>brakes,</b> air <b>conditioning,</b> power-adjustable bucket seats, power door locks, power windows, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, leather upholstery, plush carpeting, AM/FM/CB radio, leather-wrapped steering wheel, roof rack, forged aluminum wheels, and [...] "wood grain" [...] trim on the body sides. The two-barrel, 360 CID L AMC V8 engine was standard with a four-barrel, 401 CID L available at extra cost. Even though the US$10,500 suggested retail price was in luxury Cadillac territory, the Limited’s high-level specification attracted buyers and sales were strong with a total of 28,871 Wagoneers produced in 1978, and 27,437 in 1979.|$|R

50|$|Since 2004 (during {{which it}} sold {{alongside}} the Suzuki Verona), the Chevrolet Epica {{was sold in}} Canada in two trim levels, the LS and LT. It replaced the Oldsmobile Alero since the marque's phaseout in 2004, as most Chevrolet dealerships sold Oldsmobiles. For model year 2005, both versions featured the 2.5 liter inline-6, driving the front wheels through an electronically controlled four speed automatic transmission. The car was positioned as an economical luxury entry, with the LS model equipped with 8 way power seat, 15 inch alloy wheels, 4 wheel disc <b>brakes,</b> air <b>conditioning,</b> cruise control, and CD player. The LT version added traction control, ABS, and sunroof, all also optional for the LS model. Base price was $24,710 (Canadian dollars) for the LS and $27,400 (Canadian dollars) for the LT. In price, it was Chevrolet's top-of-the-line sedan in Canada, priced between the Malibu and Impala, but slotted in size between the Cobalt and Malibu. Sales of the Epica were slow in Canada, with the Impala and Malibu outselling those two models. The Chevrolet Epica is also sold as such in Chile.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2005, the Chevrolet brand was {{introduced}} to China, where it {{was described as a}} [...] "younger" [...] brand than Buick. As part of an endeavour to redefine the brand image of Buick, the Sail became the first Chinese-built Chevrolet passenger car. The Chevrolet Sail (SGM7165) received a locally upgraded design. The interior was also refined. Both sedan and wagon (now the SGM7166) forms were kept, although production of the Saibao Van ended. While sharing the original's wheelbase, the new wagon version (at 4,097 mm) is 71 mm longer than the old one's 4,026 mm. The 90 PS, 1.6 litre-engine option remained unchanged, while the transmission options originally were limited to a five-speed manual but were later joined by a four-speed automatic. Claimed top speed for the manual versions is 177 km/h.In the autumn of 2006, the Chevrolet Sail was exported to Chile as the Chevrolet Corsa Plus. The Corsa Plus includes dual front airbags, anti-lock <b>brakes,</b> air <b>conditioning,</b> electric windows and central locking as standard equipment.|$|R
25|$|In early 1992, an all new Zetec 16-valve {{engine was}} {{launched}} bringing improved driveability, while also marking {{the return of}} the XR3i which was available with two versions of the 1.8L Zetec engine. The 150PS (110kW) RS2000 also appeared in the autumn of 1991 with a 16v version of the Sierra's I4 2.0L engine and also improved ride and handling meaning that this version of the Escort finally delivered on the road. Specifications, however, were also higher than before. The Escort was now available with items such as power steering, electric windows, central locking, electronic antilock <b>brakes,</b> and air <b>conditioning.</b> Some of these options were even available on some of the entry-level models.|$|R

50|$|In Canada, sedan trims {{include the}} SE, EX, EX-L, EX-L with Navi(navigation), EX-L V6, and EX-L V6 with Navi(navigation), while coupes have the EX, EX-L, EX-L with Navi(navigation), and EX-L V6 with navi(navigation). The SE {{designation}} was {{the de facto}} replacement for the LX, VP, and DX-G trims in the previous generation, while the EX replaced the SE. The LX includes anti-lock brakes with brake assist and electronic brake force distribution, electronic stability control, front and rear disc <b>brakes,</b> air <b>conditioning,</b> keyless entry, power windows, power locks, and cruise control as standard features, while also having body-colored door handles and mirrors. The EX includes a more powerful version of the 2.4L DOHC i-VTEC engine with 190 hp, power moonroof, 17-inch alloy wheels, 8-way adjustable driver's seat, security system, and a 6-disc CD changer. EX-L denotes Accords with leather upholstery, XM satellite radio, and an optional navigation system and hands-free Bluetooth interface. V6 models have chrome handles, dual exhaust pipes, and fog lamps. The EX-L V6 coupe has 18-inch alloy rims, a rear lip spoiler, and an option of the six-speed manual {{in lieu of the}} standard five-speed automatic transmission.|$|R
500|$|All trains receive 750V DC from a {{third rail}} shoe, while the T1300 and T2000 also have pantographs. This allows the latter to also operate on the {{suburban}} lines of the Oslo Tramway, which {{the western part of}} the current metro was part of until 1995. All trains feature automatic train protection and step-free access from the platforms. Trains can operate up to six cars in length. The T1000/T1300 and MX3000 are capable of , while the T2000 can operate at [...] The T2000 introduced articulated cars, while the MX3000 introduced regenerative <b>brakes</b> and air <b>conditioning.</b> The T1000/T1300 and MX3000 can be run in multiple with each other, but not with the T2000. The MX3000 replaced the red color scheme with a white livery.|$|R
5|$|The trains {{were put}} back into service on 13 July. The trains were only allowed {{to operate at}} {{conventional}} speeds and {{had to go through}} a weekly inspection. At the same time, NSB removed the surcharge on the Signatur services. NSB stated that they were considering revocation the purchase of the four trains which were still to be delivered. In addition to problems with axles, there were also issues with the <b>braking</b> and air <b>conditioning</b> systems. In mid-August, the tilting mechanism was disabled on all the trains because of a fault in a bearing in the connection between the bogie and the body which allowed for a movement of several millimetres (at least 0.1 in). In late August, problems occurred with the braking system causing the trains to automatically brake even when not receiving such signals from the automatic train stop system.|$|R
5000|$|In EV mode, the Golf GTE has an all-electric {{range of}} 50 km. The all-electric mode can be {{activated}} at {{the push of}} a button. Under the New European Driving Cycle, combined fuel economy is [...] equivalent. The electric power can also be saved - for example when driving to a zero-emissions zone. The 8.8 kWh lithium-ion battery can be charged in around {{three and a half hours}} from a domestic mains outlet, or two and a half hours from a domestic wallbox. The battery weighs 120 kg, giving the GTE a total kerbweight of 1,520 kg.The Golf GTE uses a six-speed DSG gearbox with a triple-clutch system specially developed for hybrid vehicles. The electric motor is integrated into the gearbox housing, while further hybrid components include power electronics and a charger. An electro-mechanical brake servo and an electric air conditioning compressor make for energy-efficient <b>braking</b> and air <b>conditioning.</b>|$|R
5000|$|However, the 1957 Ford — {{with the}} {{exception}} of the rare retractable hardtop model — is not nearly as prized by collectors today as the 1957 Chevrolet. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the '57 Chevrolet was a popular used car and highly prized [...] "street machine" [...] or hot rod in 1957 terms. It was the final year of the [...] "shoebox" [...] Chevrolet, as 1958 saw the introduction of a much larger and heavier [...] "X" [...] framed Chevrolet. The ideal size of the '57, combined with its relatively light weight compared to newer full-sized cars, made it a favorite among drag racers. The engine bay was big enough to fit GM's big-block engines, first introduced in 1958 and popularized in the 1960s by the Beach Boys in the song [...] "409". The relatively simple mechanical attributes of the car made it easy to maintain, customize, and upgrade with components such as disc <b>brakes</b> and air <b>conditioning.</b>|$|R
5000|$|GM {{built the}} third design, the Firebird III, in 1958 and debuted it at Motorama in 1959. It is another extravagant concept with a {{fiberglass}} body and {{no fewer than}} seven short wings and tail fins (which were tested extensively in a wind tunnel). It is a two-seater powered by a [...] Whirlfire GT-305 gas turbine engine, with a two-cylinder [...] gasoline engine to run all the accessories. Its exterior design features a double-bubble canopy and technical advancements {{to make it more}} practical, such as cruise control, anti-lock <b>brakes,</b> and air <b>conditioning.</b> It also featured [...] "Space-Age" [...] innovations, such as special air drag brakes like those found on aircraft, which emerged from flat panels in the bodywork of the car to slow it from high speeds; an [...] "ultra-sonic" [...] key that signaled the doors to open; an automated guidance system to help avoid accidents; and [...] "no hold" [...] steering. The driver controlled the steering with a joystick positioned between the two seats. This gave the car a more futuristic feel and simulated the experience of flying a plane.|$|R
2500|$|Compared to the gasoline-only variants, several {{features}} {{are unique to}} the hybrid. In addition to the hybrid powertrain, the Camry Hybrid employs electric power steering, <b>brakes,</b> and air <b>conditioning</b> that are fully operational once {{the internal combustion engine}} is deactivated. The car can run in an all-electric mode, gasoline-only or both. A real-time dashboard screen shows power distribution and the operation of the hybrid system and the tachometer is replaced by an analog fuel economy readout. The hybrid drivetrain has also necessitated a redesigned front subframe, along with remodeled rear and center floor pressings. This was required to accommodate the battery pack, which is stowed in the trunk. Other differences include wheel spats and underbody pans which reduce aerodynamic drag from 0.28 to 0.27cd, an [...] "Eco" [...] operating mode for the HVAC system that reduces the output of air conditioning to assist fuel economy, and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM). Cosmetic changes are limited to redesigned tail lights with LEDs, a chrome-lined grille, as opposed to the color-coded version on every other Camry trim, and hybrid-oriented emblems including [...] "Hybrid" [...] badging on the front fenders and a decklid-mounted [...] "Hybrid Synergy Drive" [...] logo.|$|R
