5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E
500|$|Larter reprised {{her role}} of Claire Redfield in [...] (2010), which was filmed in 3D {{and saw her}} {{character}} ambushed and mentally manipulated by the fictional Umbrella Corporation, before she is rescued by Alice (Milla Jovovich). [...] On returning {{to the role of}} Claire, she stated in an interview with JoBlo.com: [...] "I guess people liked me as her [...] I'm excited that they <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> [...] To work with the man [...] who really created this world and this vision was what excited me about joining this next installment". Like the previous Resident Evil entries, the film received negative reviews but became a major commercial success, earning US$296 million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I think maybe she was saying the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is not what we might... it was marvelous for me because it really <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after making}} contact, Torre and Maysles (David {{had died in}} 1984) {{reconnected}} and conversed for hours, with the documentarian filming the entire time. Maysles recalled, [...] "Seeing Jerry again <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> right <b>back</b> {{to the time when}} we were all in the same little bedroom together and he was eating corn cooked by Mrs. Beale." ...|$|R

5000|$|It was {{a pretty}} unspoken thing. It wasn't {{until the last minute}} that, it was like, [...] "You wanna get back on?" [...] I was like, [...] "Yeah". We and Saari {{probably}} didn't talk for like a year or two. There was this vibe. That's how I grew up skating; those are the guys who <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> up, <b>backed</b> <b>me</b> up. And I was, like, [...] "You know what? I gotta, I gotta get back on." ...|$|R
500|$|The Japanese {{name of the}} series, , became officially romanized as New Super Android Cutey Honey or New Cutey Honey. It {{has also}} been spelled with [...] "Cutie" [...] instead of [...] "Cutey". Unlike the {{original}} Cutie Honey, the series is an [...] "OVA" [...] (original video animation), one made for home video formats such as VHS tape. OVAs {{are known for their}} higher quality than anime television series, and Toei felt the new Honey was especially high-quality because (according to them) each episode used ten thousand cels, three times the usual number. By November 1994, series planner Naoko Takahashi said that Honey was tentatively set to last twelve episodes, with more to be considered later, but the series was cut short at the eighth episode, released in late November 1995. [...] Several scenes in that episode have unshaded foregrounds, partly drawn characters with missing legs, or both. A script for a planned ninth episode was produced as a drama CD voiced by the series' original voice actors. Its English dub, made by ADV Films in 1998, features Jessica Calvello, who was hand-picked by Nagai to perform the voice of Honey. In a post at the Anime on DVD forums, voice actor and writer George Manley—who has worked for the Houston-based ADV—praised both Neya and Calvello's work in Honey as examples of [...] "impressive" [...] performances, and said that the series, whose dub was released four years before he began voice work, [...] "was the title, and I often admit this, that <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> to watching anime and started me on a long road to, 'Wow, I wonder what might happen if I moved to Houston....|$|E
500|$|From 1953 to 1967, O'Hara had a {{relationship}} with Enrique Parra, a wealthy Mexican politician and banker. She met him at a restaurant during a trip to Mexico in 1951. O'Hara stated that Parra [...] "saved me from the darkness of an abusive marriage and <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> into the warm light of life again. Leaving him {{was one of the most}} painful things I have ever had to do." [...] As her relationship with Parra progressed, she began to learn Spanish and even enrolled her daughter in a Mexican school. She moved in 1953 to a smaller property at 10677 Somma Way in Bel Air, amid frequent visits to Mexico City, where she and Parra were very well-known celebrities. She hired a detective to follow Parra in Mexico and found that he was being fully honest about the relationship with his ex-wife and that she could trust him. John Ford intensely disliked Parra, and it affected her relationship with Ford in the 1950s as he often interfered in her affairs and frowned upon the demise of her marriage to Price, being a devout Catholic like O'Hara. Price also continued to harass O'Hara for dating Parra and filed a case against her on 20 June 1955, seeking custody of Bronwyn and accusing her of immorality. O'Hara filed a countersuit, charging him with contempt of court for refusing to pay $50 a month in child support and a $7 a month alimony. During the publicity stage of The Long Gray Line in 1955, Ford insulted O'Hara and her brother Charles when he remarked to Charles, [...] "if that whore sister of yours can pull herself away from that Mexican long enough to do a little publicity for us, the film might have a chance at some decent returns".|$|E
2500|$|Eastwood {{received}} a percentage-based salary, unlike {{the first two}} films where he {{received a}} straight fee salary. When Lee Van Cleef was again cast for another Dollars film, he joked [...] "the only reason they <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> was because they forgot to kill me off in For A Few Dollars More".|$|E
60|$|At {{the head}} of the table our host was still smiling and debonair, looking as though he had been {{drinking}} nothing stronger than water; and opposite to him de Cartienne was leaning back in his chair with a faint tinge of colour in his olive cheeks and a peculiar glitter in his dark eyes which was anything but pleasant to look upon. Altogether, the appearance of the trio was like a cold douche to <b>me</b> and <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> swiftly <b>back</b> to my former watchfulness. I felt instinctively there was mischief brewing.|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{our meeting}} {{he told me}} of what had {{happened}} between him and Ethel, of whom he spoke most kindly and generously, but avowing his opinion that they never could have been happy in married life. And now I think my dear old father will see that there may be another reason besides my desire to see Mr. Binnie, which has <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> tumbling <b>back</b> to England again. If need be to speak, I never shall have, I hope, any secrets from you. I have not said much about one which has given me the deuce's disquiet for ten months past, because there was no good in talking about it, or vexing you needlessly with reports of my griefs and woes.|$|R
5000|$|Anne Yvonne Gilbert {{was born}} in Wallsend and lived in her grandparents' house with her parents. She {{attended}} Holy Cross School there as well as Ocean Road School in South Shields, eventually finishing at Morpeth Grammar School for Girls. Her grandmother was an artist, and Gilbert's parents encouraged her talent for art: [...] "I've always drawn since a baby. The seed was planted early when my mother <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> books <b>back</b> from jumble sales." [...] Gilbert spent a brief amount of time at an art college in Liverpool studying graphic design before [...] "stumbling" [...] upon {{her career as a}} professional artist. She explained, [...] "I managed to get an agent who got me a job for the Sunday Telegraph drawing six famous people as the historical characters they most wanted to be. Then I cut my teeth on women's magazines." ...|$|R
2500|$|Historian John McElwee reports, in his 2013 book Showmen, Sell It Hot!, that Bela Lugosi's {{popularity}} {{received a}} much-needed boost in August 1938, when California theater owner Emil Umann revived Dracula and Frankenstein {{as a special}} double feature. The combination was so successful that Umann scheduled extra shows to accommodate the capacity crowds, and invited Lugosi to appear in person, which thrilled new audiences that had never seen Lugosi's classic performance. [...] "I owe it all to that little man at the Regina Theatre," [...] said Lugosi of exhibitor Umann. [...] "I was dead, and he <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> to life." [...] Universal took notice of the tremendous business and launched its own national re-release of the same two horror favorites. The studio then rehired Lugosi to star in new films.|$|E

60|$|But here I must let {{the curtain}} fall. I cannot {{suppose that the}} reader, however amiable, will sympathise with the joys and sorrows of an unknown family, {{interesting}} though they were to me. I may state, however, that before I got through the budget it was so late that I turned into bed and read the remainder there. Then, as {{the fire in the}} hall-stove sank low, the cold obliged me to put on above my voluminous blankets (we dared not sleep in sheets out there) a thick buffalo robe, which, besides having on the outside the shaggy hair of the animal, to which it had belonged, was lined with flannel. Thus nestled into a warm hole, I read on until a shout arrested <b>me</b> and <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> suddenly <b>back</b> from the hills of bonny Scotland to the frozen wilderness.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fet-Fruners! {{it is you}} who <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> {{and have}} saved my life, and obeyed my wishes.

And you, and none other, shall be my husband.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, don't bother, I {{assure you}} I shall be all right. I've got ten shillings in my purse, {{and that will}} take <b>me</b> <b>back</b> from {{anywhere}} YOU have <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> to.' She hesitated. The rings were still on her fingers, two on her little finger, one on her ring finger. Still she hesitated.|$|R

She raised her face to me with her {{beautiful}} eyes in a mist of tenderness, and this time her arms were extended.|$|R

When I decided to leave the Navy, I sent TSR my résumé just for the pure hell of it. TSR sent <b>me</b> <b>back</b> a writing test, which I must have done pretty well on, since they <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> out for an {{interview}} in September of 1991.
