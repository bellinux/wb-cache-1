5000|$|The {{original}} {{plans are}} unsigned but were probably {{drawn by the}} Toowoomba City Engineer, Mr Creagh. The <b>urinal</b> <b>stalls</b> were originally connected to the nearby drain; the closet was cleaned by a pan changing service. The whole ensemble was only connected to the sewerage system in 1926. The manhole covers {{at the rear of}} the toilet may date from the time of the sewerage connection. In 1933 plans were made to alter the building but these were not carried out. The building was originally set in a [...] "rockery and garden" [...] which may have been destroyed after the Second World War. Certainly nothing now remains of the original rockery except perhaps the palm trees {{at the rear of the}} toilet.|$|R

50|$|In 2008, Afif began {{a project}} {{entitled}} the Fountain Archive. This currently contains about 500 images <b>of</b> Duchamp’s porcelain <b>urinal.</b> In this project, Afif collects and archives every single publication {{in which he}} finds a reproduction <b>of</b> Duchamp's <b>urinal.</b> As a found object, every page containing a picture <b>of</b> the <b>urinal</b> is torn out and then carefully framed. The frame, used both for its preservative and decorative purposes, {{is also part of}} the artistic process. Every step of the archiving process follows meticulous rules which form a part of this artistic process. Each new archived image has its own inventory card, which acts as a certificate of authenticity. Publications which discuss Afif's project (and therefore reproduce images <b>of</b> Duchamp's <b>urinal)</b> are also included in the Fountain Archive project: these, though, are treated as special objects as they constitute a historical echo of the original work. This is the only exception to the generally strict rule that each photograph can only be included in the Fountain Archive once.|$|R
2500|$|While urinals are {{generally}} {{intended for use}} by males, {{it is also possible}} for females to use them. Designers <b>of</b> <b>urinals</b> for women have adopted various approaches: some intending the user to [...] "hover" [...] over the unit, facing away from it, others intending the user to stand facing the urinal, with or without a female urination device. While uncommon due to restroom segregation, it is possible for females to use male urinals.|$|R
25|$|Most {{waterless}} urinals do {{not prevent}} odorous staining {{on the surface}} <b>of</b> the <b>urinals,</b> and periodic cleaning of the fixture and its surrounds is still required. When maintained according to manufacturers' recommendations, well-designed waterless urinals do not emit any more odors than flushed urinals do. However, some odor-trapping devices work better than others in the longer term. Regular, thorough maintenance of the respective odor control device is needed for all types <b>of</b> waterless <b>urinals,</b> as per the manufacturer's recommendation.|$|R

50|$|Rambuteau also {{addressed}} the absence <b>of</b> public <b>urinals,</b> {{which gave the}} side streets and parks a particular and unpleasant smell. The first public urinals had been installed during the Bourbon Restoration, just before the Revolution of July 1830, but they were dismantled and used for barricades during the street fighting. In July 1839, Rambuteau authorized {{the construction of a}} new circular type <b>of</b> <b>urinal,</b> ten to twelve feet high, made of masonry with a pointed roof and posters displayed on the outside. The first ones were placed on the Boulevard Montmartre and the Boulevard des Italiens. By 1843, there were 468 urinals in place. They became known as vespasiennes after the Roman Emperor Vespasian, who was said to have installed public toilets in ancient Rome. They were all replaced during the Second Empire by a newer cast-iron design.|$|R
50|$|Urinals {{are most}} {{frequently}} used for male patients, since they are easier to use with male anatomy. While female urinals exist, they {{are more difficult to}} use, and the common practice for females is to use a bedpan. Female urinals require a wider opening and must be placed between the legs. For many women, female urinals are more practical in a wheelchair rather than in a bed. But the opening part <b>of</b> <b>urinal</b> may get infected by the germs and can be disinfected by various chemicals.|$|R

50|$|Sex {{segregation}} in public restrooms {{refers to the}} separation of public toilets into the sex categories of male and female. In the United States, sex-based separation of public restrooms {{began in the late}} 19th century as a response to women not having toilets available to them in the workplace. In contemporary times, this separation is typically enforced by both city laws and building codes. Key differences between male and female restrooms in most western countries include the presence <b>of</b> <b>urinals</b> for men and sanitary bins for the disposal of menstrual hygiene products for women.|$|R

50|$|According {{to local}} {{historian}} Jennette Rivers, the townspeople were {{wary of the}} relatively new technology for several reasons.

The townspeople were wary of this new technology and its potential harmful impact and were susceptible to believing rumors regarding health risks involved with urinal use. Another worry to the community was the lack of privacy associated with urinals. Urinals were more exposed than the traditional stalls or outhouses and this was considered immodest by the elders of what was a heavily Protestant community.|$|R
