During this period, he witnessed a <b>Brocken</b> spectre and glory, caused by the sun casting a shadow on a cloud below the observer. He subsequently tried to reproduce these phenomena in the laboratory, resulting in his invention of the cloud chamber, used to detect ionising radiation.|$|E

Robert and George Colwan, two feuding brothers, are caught in a fog atop Arthur's Seat and witness what could be interpreted as a <b>Brocken</b> spectre, a strange phenomenon of the light, which causes George to believe that he is seeing a ghost. In the confusion, Robert nearly kills George, but they both escape {{to the bottom of the}} hill as the fog begins to clear.|$|E
25|$|The German Meteorological Service {{had advised}} {{people to stay}} indoors and avoid {{unnecessary}} trips on 18 January, and wind strengths of up to 12 on the Beaufort scale were seen across the Netherlands and Germany as the storm made landfall. The storm moved across the German states of Lower Saxony, Bremen, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia first, then spread across the whole country in the evening hours of 18 January. Wind gusts as high as 202km/h (125mph) on the Wendelstein and 198km/h (123mph) on the <b>Brocken</b> in the Harz mountains were recorded. The storm then moved eastwards, its center crossing Lower Saxony between 18:00 and 19:00 CET, moving toward the Baltic sea, its cold front spawning several tornadoes in Germany, three {{of which have been}} confirmed as of 22 February. In the Czech Republic the highest wind speed was measured on Sněžka in the Krkonoše mountains, where wind gusts reached 212km/h (132mph). In the Czech Republic winds as high as 200km/h disrupted both rail and air traffic; record high temperatures reached 14°C (57°F) in Prague.|$|E

60|$|Huge torches of gum and resin flickered at the {{entrance}} of every booth, throwing quaint red lights, and deep, mysterious shadows all round, distorting the faces of the gaping multitude, and of the criers, until they looked like fantastic figures, wizards all from some neighbouring <b>Brocken.</b>|$|E

60|$|But now the Spectre of the <b>Brocken</b> is {{no longer}} an object of fear. Why? Because men have found him out, and he is nothing in the world but a shadow. When the sun is in the right position, an ordinary-sized man on a lower {{mountain}} will see a gigantic shadow of himself thrown upon a cloud beyond the <b>Brocken,</b> though it appears to be on the mountain itself, and it is so perfect a representation {{that it is difficult to}} believe it is only a shadow. But it can be easily proved. If the man stoops to pick up anything, down goes the spectre; if he raises his hand, so does the spectre; if he takes a step of two feet, the spectre takes one of miles; if he raises his hat, the spectre politely returns his salute.|$|E

(1856, i. 66), prints stanzas 1, 3, and 4.

As far as I know, {{this cluster}} of wayward cliff and dingle has no common {{name as a}} group of hills; and it is quite {{impossible}} to make out the diverse branching of it in any maps I can lay hand on: but we may remember easily, and usefully, that it is all north of the Maine,--that it rests on the Drachenfels at one end, and tosses itself away to the morning light with a concave swoop, up to the Hartz, (<b>Brocken</b> summit, 3700 feet above sea, nothing higher): with one notable interval for Weser stream, of which presently.|$|E
60|$|Other {{stories of}} the same kind are {{numerous}} and well known. The apparition of the <b>Brocken</b> mountain, after having occasioned great admiration and some fear, is now ascertained by philosophers to be a gigantic reflection, which makes the traveller's shadow, represented upon the misty clouds, appear a colossal figure of almost immeasurable size. By a similar deception men have been induced, in Westmoreland and other mountainous countries, to imagine they saw troops of horse and armies marching and countermarching, which were in fact only the reflection of horses pasturing upon an opposite height, or of the forms of peaceful travellers.|$|E
60|$|Soon it grew dark, and we strode on up {{hill and}} down dale, {{at one time}} for a mile or more through burnt forest, with its ghastly spider-work of {{leafless}} decaying branches and creepers against the moonlit sky--a sad sight: but music enough we had to cheer us on our way. We did not hear the howl of a monkey, nor the yell of a tiger-cat, common enough on the mountains which lay in front of us; but of harping, fiddling, humming, drumming, croaking, clacking, snoring, screaming, hooting, from cicadas, toads, birds, and what not, there was a concert at every step, which made the glens ring again, as the <b>Brocken</b> might ring on a Walpurgis-night.|$|E
60|$|When I {{was last}} at Avallon, in South France, I {{went to see}} 'Faust' played at the little country theater: it was done with {{scarcely}} any means of pictorial effect, except a few old curtains, and a blue light or two. But the night on the <b>Brocken</b> was nevertheless extremely appalling to me,--a strange ghastliness being obtained {{in some of the}} witch scenes merely by fine management of gesture and drapery; and in the phantom scenes, by the half-palsied, half-furious, faltering or fluttering past of phantoms stumbling as into graves; as if of not only soulless, but senseless, Dead, moving with the very action, the rage, the decrepitude, and the trembling of the plague-wind.|$|E
60|$|Jill {{remained}} {{where she}} was, leaning {{with one hand}} against the switchboard. She {{made no attempt to}} follow the directions he had given her. She was aware of a sense of comradeship, of being with this man in this adventure. If he stayed, she must stay. To go now through the safety of the stage-door would be abominable desertion. She listened, and found that she could hear plainly in spite of the noise. The smoke was worse than ever, and hurt her eyes, so that the figures of the theatre-firemen, hurrying to and fro, seemed like <b>Brocken</b> spectres. She slipped a corner of her cloak across her mouth, and was able to breathe more easily.|$|E
6000|$|... 34. We have {{hitherto}} got {{no farther}} in our {{notion of a}} Salian Frank than a glimpse of his two principal weapons,--the shadow of him, however, begins to shape itself to us on the mist of the <b>Brocken,</b> bearing the lance light, passing into the javelin,--but the axe, his woodman's weapon, heavy;--for economical reasons, in scarcity of iron, preferablest of all weapons, giving the fullest swing and weight of blow with least quantity of actual metal, and roughest forging. Gibbon gives them also a 'weighty' sword, suspended from a 'broad' belt: but Gibbon's epithets are always gratis, and the belted sword, whatever its measure, was probably for the leaders only; the belt, itself of gold, the distinction of the Roman Counts, and doubtless adopted from them by the allied Frank leaders, afterwards taking the Pauline mythic meaning of the girdle of Truth--and so finally; the chief mark of Belted Knighthood.|$|E
60|$|His face worked, and {{the tears}} were in his eyes; then, as he partook of our breakfast, he cross-examined us on my statement, and even tried to persuade us that the phantom in the ruin was Emily; and on her observing {{that she could not}} have seen herself, he talked of the <b>Brocken</b> Spectre and fog mirages; but we {{declared}} the night was clear, and I told him that all the rational theories I had ever heard were far more improbable than the appearance herself, at which he laughed. Then he scrupulously demanded whether this--this (he failed to find a name for it) would be an impoverishment of our family, and I showed how Clarence had provided that we should be in as easy circumstances as before. In the midst came in Clarence himself, having hastened to dress, on hearing that Mr. Fordyce was in the house, and looking none the better for the exertion.|$|E
60|$|Take a New-England selectman, and set him on {{the highest}} of our hills, {{and tell him to}} look,--sharpening his sight to the utmost, and putting on the glasses that suit him best, (ay, using a spy-glass, if he likes,)--and make a full report. What, probably, will he spy?--what will he select to look at? Of course, he will see a <b>Brocken</b> spectre of himself. He will see several meeting-houses, at least, and, perhaps, that {{somebody}} ought to be assessed higher than he is, since he has so handsome a wood-lot. Now take Julius Caesar, or Immanuel Swedenborg, or a Fegee-Islander, and set him up there. Or suppose all together, and let them compare notes afterward. Will it appear that they have enjoyed the same prospect? What they will see will be as different as Rome was from Heaven or Hell, or the last from the Fegee Islands. For aught we know, as strange a man as any of these is always at our elbow.|$|E
60|$|The {{intended}} {{theme of}} the Faust is {{the consequences of a}} misology, or hatred and depreciation of knowledge caused by an originally intense thirst for knowledge baffled. But a love of knowledge for itself, and for pure ends, would never produce such a misology, but only a love of it for base and unworthy purposes. There is neither causation nor progression in the Faust; he is a ready-made conjuror from the very beginning; the incredulus odi is felt from the first line. The sensuality and the thirst after knowledge are unconnected with each other. Mephistopheles and Margaret are excellent; but Faust himself is dull and meaningless. The scene in Auerbach's cellars is one of the best, perhaps the very best; that on the <b>Brocken</b> is also fine; and all the songs are beautiful. But there is no whole in the poem; the scenes are mere magic-lantern pictures, and {{a large part of the}} work is to me very flat. The German is very pure and fine.|$|E
6000|$|In nature {{all things}} are individual, but a word is but an {{arbitrary}} character for a whole class of things; so that the same description may in almost all cases be applied to twenty different appearances; {{and in addition to}} the difficulty of the thing itself, I neither am, nor ever was, a good hand at description. I see what I write, but, alas! I cannot write what I see. From the Oder Seich we entered a second wood; and now the snow met us in large masses, and we walked for two miles knee-deep in it, with an inexpressible fatigue, till we came to the mount called Little Brocken; here even the firs deserted us, or only now and then a patch of them, wind-shorn, no higher than one's knee, matted and cowering to the ground, like our thorn bushes on the highest sea-hills. The soil was plashy and boggy; we descended and came {{to the foot of the}} Great <b>Brocken</b> without a river--the highest mountain in all the north of Germany, and the seat of innumerable superstitions. On the first of May all the witches dance here at midnight; and those who go may see their own ghosts walking up and down, with a little billet on the back, giving the names of those who had wished them there; for [...] "I wish you on the top of the Brocken," [...] is a common curse throughout the whole empire. Well, we ascended--the soil boggy--and at last reached the height, which is 573 toises [1] above the level of the sea. We visited the Blocksberg, a sort of bowling-green, enclosed by huge stones, something like those at Stonehenge, and this is the witches' ball-room; thence proceeded to the house on the hill, where we dined; and now we descended. In the evening about seven we arrived at Elbingerode. At the inn they brought us an album, or stammbuch, requesting that we would write our names, and something or other as a remembrance that we had been there. I wrote the following lines, which contain a true account of my journey from the <b>Brocken</b> to Elbingerode.|$|E
6000|$|Clement Carlyon, who is {{the chief}} {{authority}} {{for the life of}} Coleridge during his stay at Gttingen, gives a lively account of the ascent of the <b>Brocken,</b> which took place on Whit Sunday, 12th May 1799. The party visited the [...] "magic circle of stones where the fairies assembled," [...] and halted {{for the first time at}} the village of Satzfeld, a romantic village, [...] "a bright moonlight at night, and the nightingale heard." [...] Coleridge was in high spirits, and kept talking all the way, discoursing on his favourite topics. Sublimity was defined as a [...] "suspension of the powers of comparison"; [...] "no animal but man can be struck with wonder"; Shakespeare owed his success largely to the cheering breath of popular applause, the enthusiastic gale of admiration. The English Divines were applauded by Coleridge, Jeremy Taylor prominently; and a play by Hans Sachs was preferred to a play of Kotzebue; from which he launched into a discourse on Miracle plays. Coleridge's conversation was peppered with puns, some of which Carlyon quotes.|$|E
