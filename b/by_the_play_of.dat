25|$|In 1997, Ohio State {{hoped to}} return the favor: the 10–0 Wolverines sat atop the AP Poll {{entering}} their matchup with the 10–1 Buckeyes, who were ranked #4. Spearheaded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>of</b> eventual Heisman winner Charles Woodson, who ran a punt back for a touchdown, intercepted a pass in the Ohio State end zone, and caught a 37-yard pass that set up freshman running back Anthony Thomas' touchdown run, the Wolverines prevailed, 20–14.

25|$|Free-agent goaltender Jeff Hackett {{was signed}} from Boston to replace Cechmanek and {{challenge}} backup Robert Esche for the starter's spot in 2003–04, but Hackett {{was forced to}} retire in February due to vertigo. During {{the course of the}} season, serious injuries suffered by both Roenick (broken jaw) and Primeau (concussion) in February forced the Flyers to trade for Chicago's Alexei Zhamnov, who filled in well and kept the Flyers afloat. On March 5, 2004, the Flyers set an NHL record in a game against Ottawa where they set a combined record of 419 penalty minutes in a single game. Esche entrenched himself as starter and remained in that position even after the Flyers re-acquired Sean Burke from the Phoenix Coyotes as the Flyers clinched the Atlantic Division title over New Jersey {{on the last day of}} the season. Though solid in net, Esche's performance was trumped <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>of</b> captain Keith Primeau in the playoffs. Primeau led the Flyers past the defending Stanley Cup champion Devils in five, and Toronto in six on their way to the Eastern Conference Finals and a match-up with Tampa Bay. Despite winning Game 6 on the late-game heroics of Primeau and winger Simon Gagne, the Flyers came up short once again losing Game 7 in Tampa, 2–1.|$|E

500|$|After {{only one}} {{season at the}} Nordiques, Hextall {{was traded to the}} New York Islanders in return for Mark Fitzpatrick during the off-season, a move made because the Nordiques could only protect one goalie for the {{expansion}} draft and instead of losing him chose to trade him to Long Island. The two teams also traded first round draft picks. The move was a surprise for Hextall, who had settled in well in Quebec with his family. Don Maloney, the Islanders' General Manager, described the trade as [...] "too good to pass up". The trade was praised by The New York Times as possibly [...] "the best in the league over the off season". Hextall had a poor beginning to his career as an Islander, conceding 23goals in 14periods {{at the start of the}} season, resulting in his replacement prior to the third period against the New Jersey Devils in mid-October. During that game, in which the Islanders were playing at home, Hextall was jeered by the crowd, something to which he had become accustomed during his time with Philadelphia. In contrast to the fan's derision, Hextall's teammates backed him, taking some of the blame themselves, and expressing their belief in their new colleague. Steve Thomas suggested that Hextall was [...] "one of the best goalies in the league, easily in the top five or10," [...] while coach Al Arbour dismissed dropping Hextall, saying that [...] "We're not playing well in front of the goaltender and he can only be as good as the guys in front of him." [...] Any thoughts that Arbour might have had of replacing Hextall as the team's number-one goaltender were limited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>of</b> his back-up, Tom Draper, who recorded a GAA of4.23 in the seven NHL games he played that season. This, coupled with the lack of experienced goaltenders at the club's IHL affiliate, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles, resulted in Hextall starting 20games in a row until Jamie McLennan was called up from the Golden Eagles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{match was}} {{highlighted}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>of</b> a few notable Sooners including freshman running back DeMarco Murray, wide receivers Juaquin Iglesias and Malcolm Kelly, and quarterback Sam Bradford. Murray finished {{the game with}} 128yards on 17carries including a 65yard touchdown run. Kelly caught five passes for 105yards including a 41yard catch that led to an Oklahoma touchdown and a game winning 35yard touchdown catch. Iglesias finished with six catches for 99yards even though two of his catches were counted as laterals. Bradford led the Sooner offense against Texas for the first time. Kelly made note of Bradford's demeanor: [...] "His demeanor never changes. Never looks happy, never looks sad. That's just Sam." [...] Bradford led the Sooners on an 84yard touchdown drive in the 1st quarter and a 94yard touchdown drive in the 4th quarter.|$|E

2500|$|Unsportsmanlike conduct : Arguing with a referee; using slurs {{against an}} {{opponent}} or teammate; playing with illegal equipment; making obscene gestures or abusing an official. Can carry either a minor, misconduct, game misconduct or match penalty, {{depending on the}} gravity of the infraction (for instance, using obscene language to a referee initially results in a minor, but making an obscene gesture to an opponent, fan or official carries a game misconduct.) Also, in some leagues the penalty progression is different for players and team officials (for example, in the USA Hockey rulebook players get a minor for their first infraction, a misconduct for their second and a game misconduct for their third, whereas the option of a misconduct is removed for coaches; in addition, after each penalty for [...] a team official, the penalty count resets itself). Unsportsmanlike conduct may also be called if a player drops gloves and stick in preparation for a fight, but the non-offending player does not drop the corresponding equipment and has committed no action (verbal or physical harassment) to attempt to instigate a fight. Since 2008, the NHL has ruled that standing in front of an opposing goaltender and engaging [...] "in actions such as waving his arms or stick in front of the goaltender's face, for the purpose of improperly interfering with and/or distracting the goaltender" [...] will draw a minor unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, a rule interpretation inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>of</b> Sean Avery against Martin Brodeur.|$|E
