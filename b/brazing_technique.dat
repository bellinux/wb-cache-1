40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the development of a <b>brazing</b> <b>technique</b> for monolithic SiC and SiCf/SiC composites. This <b>brazing</b> <b>technique</b> is based on the use of Si- 16 Ti (at. %) and Si- 18 Cr (at %) eutectic alloys. The brazing temperature of the used alloys allows to avoid the degradation of the fibre/matrix-interfaces in the composite materials at least for advanced stoichiometric SiC fibre composites. All the joints showed excellent adhesion and no discontinuities and defects at the interface, while the brazing layer revealed a fine eutectic structure. In particular, in the composite joints the brazing layer appeared well adherent both to the matrix, the fibres and the fibre-matrix interphase, and the brazing alloy infiltration looked sufficiently controlled. The brazing alloys were characterized by X ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). All the brazed joints were analysed by SEM and the Si- 16 Ti joints were also characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy investigations of the microstructure and of the nanochemistry (HREM, EELS, esp. ELNES). These analyses revealed atomically sharp interfaces without interdiffusion or phase formation at the interface leading to the conclusion that direct chemical bonds are responsible for the adhesion. Shear tests performed at room temperature and 600 °C on lap joint specimens gave remarkable results: the samples manufactured with monolithic SiC exhibit a high shear stress level and mainly cracked in the SiC bulk (150 MPa at RT for Si- 18 Cr joints), while the composite samples exhibited a RT shear strength up to 70 MPa for Si- 16 Ti and up to 80 MPa for Si- 18 Cr with failure occurring mainly in the base material...|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{discovered at}} 1991 have attracted great interest for applications in Nano-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (NEMS). However, {{the search for}} methods to join CNTs with metallic parts has been a worldwide challenge. Many efforts have been devoted to manipulating individual CNTs and joining them to each other. Joining processes so far attempted are premature and fall short of efficiency for joint quality evaluation. Thus, {{it has been found}} necessary to work on macro CNTs strands which are easy to handle via macro joining techniques. In this study, vacuum brazing technology has been developed for joining macro CNTs strands with Ni using a Ti-Ag-Cu alloy. The brazing mechanism has been confirmed as due to TiC formation at the CNTs/Ti-Ag-Cu interface. To evaluate this novel vacuum <b>brazing</b> <b>technique</b> for CNTs joining, the temperature effect on the brazing mechanism, microstructure and stoichiometry at joint interface needed to be understood. Firstly, the influence of temperature (from room temperature to 1000 C) on mechanical behaviour of CNTs was well examined. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of CNTs was measured to be a maximum at 900 C. Then, the mechanical performance of the joints was investigated from 850 C to 1000 C, and the fracture modes of the joints were identified. The UTS of joint also achieves maximum at 900 C. Below 900 C, due to little TiC formation, the bonding is weak thus leading to interfacial fracture. Above 900 C, due to much TiC formation, the bonding is strong thus resulting in CNTs fracture. Furthermore, the vacuum <b>brazing</b> <b>technique</b> was applied to join CNTs to Ni contact wires used as a lamp filament. Compared to the filament joined by Ag paste or mechanical connection, the illumination of the brazed CNTs filament was stronger. The current density of the brazed filament was superior to the Ag paste connected filament. This may represent a promising way to produce energy saving lamps...|$|E
