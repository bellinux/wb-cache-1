5|$|Despite these {{organs of}} {{military}} occupation, and the orders issued by OKH, regulating {{as they did}} {{a wide range of}} administrative, political, economic, cultural and social matters, the Germans still needed to establish a public administrative <b>body</b> <b>that</b> would implement their directives.

5|$|A basic {{sub-division}} is a {{grouping of}} the eight inner regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator and {{are thought to have}} formed with Jupiter. The remainder of the moons consist of an unknown number of small irregular moons with elliptical and inclined orbits, which are thought to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. Irregular moons that belong to a group share similar orbital elements and thus may have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured <b>body</b> <b>that</b> broke up.|$|E
5|$|A flight {{behaviour}} {{in which}} a bird rapidly descends with a zig-zagging, side-slipping motion. During whiffling, some birds invert the aerodynamic mechanics of their <b>body</b> <b>that</b> normally provide lift—flying by turning their bodies upside down but with their necks twisted 180 degrees to keep their heads in a normal flying position—resulting in a rapid plummet, before a quick arrest of the fall by resuming a normal flying orientation.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{we show that}} there is no local {{equatorial}} characterization of <b>bodies</b> <b>that</b> embed in Lp in odd dimensions for all p not even, 0 <p<∞.

This extends results given in Panina (1988) [13], Goodey and Weil (1992) [5], and Nazarov, Ryabogin and Zvavitch (2008) [12] concerning the local equatorial characterization of zonoids and intersection bodies.

5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity {{depend on the}} ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's <b>body</b> <b>that</b> can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E
5|$|By 6:30a.m. {{the battle}} for the Alamo was over. Mexican {{soldiers}} inspected each corpse, bayoneting any <b>body</b> <b>that</b> moved. Even with all of the Texians dead, Mexican soldiers continued to shoot, some killing each other in the confusion. Mexican generals were unable to stop the bloodlust and appealed to Santa Anna for help. Although the general showed himself, the violence continued and the buglers were finally ordered to sound a retreat. For 15minutes after that, soldiers continued to fire into dead bodies.|$|E

According to a molecular analysis published in 2006, out of the about 40 Phallales species used in the study, C.ruber is most closely related to Aseroe rubra, Clathrus archeri, Laternea triscapa, and Clathrus chrysomycelinus.|$|E
