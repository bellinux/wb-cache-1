40|$|Electrical power {{generation}} {{is paid for}} {{on the basis of}} the marginal costs of generation, and supply is paid for at the marginal cost at the supply point. In the case where power lines form a loop and there is a limit on a line within the loop, the electrical requirements of providing supply force a reallocation of generation and a step change in the marginal costs. This is known as the <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> effect. In some cases the cost of supply can reach extreme levels. Transpower and its customers are interested in obtaining a better understanding of these events. Simplified equations determining {{power generation}} and pricing are derived. So-lutions for the supply costs are obtained for several simple cases. Numerical exam-ples and a graphical representation demonstrate the <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> effect and how a <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> responds to changes. Several possible changes that reduce the cost of supply are demonstrated. When a <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> comes active the marginal prices make a step change. This means that power costs can be be highly sensitive to the values of all the network parameters that affect the power flow in the power loop.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Belleville</b> <b>springs</b> or coned disc springs are {{commonly}} used in machine design. The geometric dimensions of the spring and the determination of non-linear forceâ€“displacement curve are regulated by different standards. However, the theory behind <b>Belleville</b> <b>spring</b> design standards is founded on {{a study published in}} 1936. Furthermore, the common spring design with cross-sections of uniform thickness poses problems in terms of non-uniformity of stress distribution. In view of this, non-linear three-dimensional finite element analyses of spring designs including uniform or variable thickness are carried out in this paper. Finite element results are compared with analytical predictions and critically analysed in terms of the effect of Poisson ratio, overall stiffness, and stress distribution in the spring. This is done in order to verify the range of validity of design standards. Finite element analysis emerges as a powerful and computationally cheap approach to assess the structural behaviour of <b>Belleville</b> <b>springs</b> regardless of their geometry and level of non-linearity...|$|R

Every-flight inspections were instituted and the rollers were found to be cracked after only one flight. Engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center, Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center worked together to determine a solution. There were several possible contributors to the failure: a mis-aligned visor, an out of specification edge with a sharp radius, an out of specification tolerance stack up of a <b>Belleville</b> <b>spring</b> stack that caused un-predicted loads on the Vespel SP- 21 roller, and a dimple machined {{into the side of the}} roller to indicate LO 2 compatibility that created a stress riser.
