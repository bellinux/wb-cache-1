25|$|The surge-line {{shown in}} Figure 5.2 is the curve that {{passes through the}} lowest flow points {{of each of the}} four speed lines. As a test map, these points would be the lowest flow points {{possible}} to record a stable reading within the test facility/rig. In many industrial applications {{it may be necessary to}} increase the stall line due to the system <b>backpressure.</b> For example, at 100% RPM stalling flow might increase from approximately 0.170kg/s to 0.215kg/s because of the positive slope of the pressure ratio curve.|$|E
25|$|Surge - is {{the point}} at which the {{compressor}} cannot add enough energy to overcome the system resistance or <b>backpressure.</b> This causes a rapid flow reversal (i.e., surge). As a result, high vibration, temperature increases, and rapid changes in axial thrust can occur. These occurrences can damage the rotor seals, rotor bearings, the compressor driver and cycle operation. Most turbomachines are designed to easily withstand occasional surging. However, if the machine is forced to surge repeatedly for a long period of time, or if it is poorly designed, repeated surges can result in a catastrophic failure. Of particular interest, is that while turbomachines may be very durable, the cycles/processes that they are used within can be far less robust.|$|E
2500|$|A free {{floating}} turbocharger is the simplest type of turbocharger. This configuration has no wastegate and can’t control its own boost levels. They are typically designed to attain maximum boost at full throttle. Free floating turbochargers produce more horsepower {{because they have}} less <b>backpressure,</b> but are not driveable in performance applications without an external wastegate.|$|E
50|$|Monoliths are {{ideally suited}} for large molecules. As {{mentioned}} previously, particle sizes are decreasing {{in an attempt}} to achieve higher resolution and faster separations, which led to higher <b>backpressures.</b> When the smaller particle sizes are used to separate biomolecules, <b>backpressures</b> increase further because of the large molecule size. In monoliths, where <b>backpressures</b> are low and channel sizes are large, small molecule separations are less efficient. This is demonstrated by the dynamic binding capacities, a measure of how much sample can bind {{to the surface of the}} stationary phase. Dynamic binding capacities of monoliths for large molecules can be an order of ten times greater than that for particulate packings.|$|R

Recently developed core-shell columns consist of a porous shell and a solid silica core. Thus the mobile phase is only allowed to flow along the porous shell of the particles, decreasing <b>backpressures</b> whilst increasing efficiency. The objective {{of this study was}} to use such column technology to minimize the elution time of the drug candesartan cilexetil and its impurities, whilst improving resolution and selectivity.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of {{microfluidic}} systems, it {{has been difficult to}} devise pumping systems that can deliver adequate flow rates at high pressure for applications such as HPLC. An on-chip electrochemical pumping system based on electrolysis that offers certain advantages over designs that utilize electroosmotic driven flow has been fabricated and tested. The pump was fabricated on both silicon and glass substrates using photolithography. The electrolysis electrodes were formed from either platinum or gold, and SU 8, an epoxy-based photoresist, was used to form the pump chambers. A glass cover plate and a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) gasket were used to seal the chambers. Filling of the chambers was accomplished by using a syringe to inject liquid via filling ports, which were later sealed using a glass cover plate. The current supplied to the electrodes controlled the rate of gas formation and, thus, the resulting fluid flow rate. At low <b>backpressures,</b> flow rates > 1 μL/min have been demonstrated using < 1 mW of power. Pumping at <b>backpressures</b> as high as 200 psi have been demonstrated, with 20 nL/min having been observed using < 4 mW. By integrating two electrochemical pumps with a polymer electrospray nozzle, we have confirmed the successful generation of a solvent gradient via a mass spectrometer...|$|R

The Super Turbine 400 transmission retained its variable pitch torque converter, but was fitted with a three-speed gear selector.

2500|$|A new and {{short-lived}} {{option for}} 1970 was the vacuum operated exhaust (VOE), which was vacuum actuated via an underdash lever marked [...] "exhaust". The VOE {{was designed to}} reduce exhaust <b>backpressure</b> and to increase power and performance, but it also substantially increased exhaust noise. The VOE option was offered from November 1969 to January 1970. Pontiac management was ordered to cancel the VOE option by GM's upper management following a TV commercial for the GTO that aired during Super Bowl IV on CBS January 11, 1970. In that commercial, entitled the [...] "Humbler", which was broadcast only that one time, a young man pulled up in a new GTO to a drive-in restaurant with dramatic music and exhaust noise in the background, pulling the [...] "exhaust" [...] knob to activate the VOE and then left the drive-in after failing to find a street racing opponent. That particular commercial was also cancelled by order of GM management. Approximately 233 1970 GTOs were factory built with this rare option including 212 hardtop coupes and 21 convertbiles, all were [...] "YS" [...] 400ci 350hp with either four-speed manual or Turbo Hydra-matic transmissions.

Both the external and internal flow paths of the inlet have been analyzed. Conducted measurements include static and Pitot pressure measurements, shadowgraph imagery, IR-thermography, Mach number and mass flow measurements.

The pressure drop increase not dramatically if to compare stages 2, 3 and 4 (oil filtration). If to compare stages 1 and 2, then the pressure drop increases considerably since properties of fluids are very different. Aggregation of asphaltenes takes some prolonged period comparable to the experiment duration. Respectively, pressure drop gradually increases over time as a result of asphaltene aggregation, their trapping into the porous medium, deposition and clogging of pore throats.|$|R

Polymerization is accomplished in situ, in a stainless steel column, and the polymer is then derivatized to have selective binding sites for the target metal ions. This column is used in a chromatographic type separation, in which the sample is loaded onto the column and eluted with an appropriate mobile phase. Detection is accomplished by UV-Vis spectroscopy or conductivity. Back pressures are very high unless the gel is sufficiently porous, in which case it also has to be stabilized in the column with support scaffolding.

50|$|Monoliths {{also have}} very short {{diffusion}} distances, while also providing multiple pathways for solute dispersion. Packed particle columns have pore connectivity values of about 1.5, while monoliths have values ranging from 6 to greater than 10. This means that, in a particulate column, a given analyte may diffuse {{into and out}} of the same pore, or enter through one pore and exit through a connected pore. By contrast, an analyte in a monolith is able to enter one channel and exit through any of 6 or more different venues. Little of the surface area in a monolith is inaccessible to compounds in the mobile phase. The high degree of interconnectivity in monoliths confers an advantage seen in the low <b>backpressures</b> and readily achievable high flow rates.|$|R

The microvalves are derived from a prior micropump design and optimized for elevated flow. Alternative valve sizes were employed and show the anticipated effect on the pump's flow characteristics. Flow rates of up to 85 ml/min with water and 310 ml/min with air have thus been achieved. These results promise application potential beyond the intended use in medical air humidification.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{stereolithography}} has developed rapidly {{over the last}} 20 years, and commercially available systems currently have sufficient resolution for use in microengineering applications. However, they have not as yet been fully exploited in this field. This thesis investigates the possible microengineering applications of microstereolithography systems, specifically {{in the areas of}} active microfluidic devices and microneedles. The fields of micropumps and microvalves, stereolithography and microneedles are reviewed, and a variety of test builds were fabricated using the EnvisionTEC Perfactory Mini Multi-Lens stereolithography system in order to define its capabilities. A number of microneedle geometries were considered. This number was narrowed down using finite element modelling, before another simulation was used to optimise these structures. 9 × 9 arrays of 400 μm tall, 300 μm base diameter microneedles were subjected to mechanical testing. Per needle failure forces of 0. 263 and 0. 243 N were recorded for the selected geometries, stepped cone and inverted trumpet. The 90 μm needle tips were subjected to between 30 and 32 MPa of pressure at their failure point - more than 10 times the required pressure to puncture average human skin. A range of monolithic micropumps were produced with integrated 4 mm diameter single-layer 70 μm-thick membranes used as the basis for a reciprocating displacement operating principle. The membranes were tested using an oscillating pneumatic actuation, and were found reliable (> 1, 000, 000 cycles) up to 2. 0 PSIG. Pneumatic single-membrane nozzle/diffuser rectified devices produced flow rates of up to 1, 000 μl/min with <b>backpressures</b> of up to 375 Pa. Another device rectified using active membrane valves was found to self-prime, and produced <b>backpressures</b> of up to 4. 9 kPa.
