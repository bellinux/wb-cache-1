5|$|A few {{deductions}} {{can also}} <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> the satellite communications. The first deduction that can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> the satellite communications {{is that the}} aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying BFO values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so {{it can also be}} deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E
5|$|A second instrument, Doppler Orbit and Radio Positioning Integration by Satellite, or DORIS, {{is used to}} {{calculate}} precisely the spacecraft's orbit. An array of retroreflectors are also carried aboard the spacecraft, and allow measurements to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> the ground to verify the orbital data provided by DORIS.|$|E
5|$|Grills {{are made}} of several types of metal (often silver, gold or platinum) that are {{sometimes}} inlaid with precious stones; they are generally removable, though some may be permanently attached to the teeth. Gold grills can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> 10-karat, up to 24-karat gold. The gold can be tinted yellow, white and rose color.|$|E

5|$|Iridium {{is used in}} {{particle}} physics {{for the production of}} antiprotons, a form of antimatter. Antiprotons are made by shooting a high-intensity proton beam at a conversion target, which needs to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> a very high density material. Although tungsten may be used instead, iridium has the advantage of better stability under the shock waves induced by the temperature rise due to the incident beam.|$|E
5|$|The {{chlorine}} oxides are well-studied {{in spite of}} their instability (all of them are endothermic compounds). They are important because they are produced when chlorofluorocarbons undergo photolysis in the upper atmosphere and cause the destruction of the ozone layer. None of them can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> directly reacting the elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} inferences that can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> the A-not-B error has been challenged.

5|$|A {{break in}} the weather allowed the RAF to finally fly combat {{missions}} against the German forces surrounding Urquhart's men. Hawker Typhoons and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts strafed German positions throughout the day and occasionally dueled with the Luftwaffe over the battlefield. The RAF attempted their final resupply flight from Britain on the Saturday afternoon, but lost eight planes for little gain to the Airborne troops. Some small resupply efforts would <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> Allied airfields in Europe {{over the next two}} days but to little effect.|$|E
5|$|A few {{deductions}} can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> {{the satellite}} communications. The {{first is that}} the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19 MYT—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying burst frequency offset (BFO) values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so {{it can also be}} deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E

5|$|According to the International Energy Agency, {{cellulosic}} ethanol biorefineries {{could allow}} biofuels {{to play a}} much bigger role in the future than {{organizations such as the}} IEA previously thought. Cellulosic ethanol can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s, Bill Morris was {{studying}} giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them ?L. laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used {{a question mark}} in his work because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not <b>be</b> <b>made.</b> <b>From</b> what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, {{as well as a}} healed broken thigh bone that he thought would have been too much of a handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimate}} of a horse's age can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, {{and changes in}} the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough {{estimate of}} a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.|$|E
50|$|Slugs <b>are</b> usually <b>made</b> <b>from</b> metals differing {{from those}} of real coins. While genuine coins in the United States {{currency}} <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> various alloys of copper, nickel, and zinc, Canadian coins <b>are</b> <b>made</b> mostly <b>from</b> steel with some copper and nickel, and euro coins <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> steel, nickel, and brass, slugs <b>are</b> frequently <b>made</b> <b>from</b> differing metals and alloys that are cheaper to obtain and mold, such as aluminum, tin, and lead.|$|R

5|$|Bromine oxides {{are not as}} {{well-characterised}} as {{chlorine oxides}} or iodine oxides, as they are all fairly unstable: it was once thought {{that they could not}} exist at all. Dibromine monoxide is a dark-brown solid which, while reasonably stable at −60°C, decomposes at its melting point of −17.5°C; it is useful in bromination reactions and may <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> the low-temperature decomposition of bromine dioxide in a vacuum. It oxidises iodine to iodine pentoxide and benzene to 1,4-benzoquinone; in alkaline solutions, it gives the hypobromite anion.|$|E
5|$|In 1781, Carl Wilhelm Scheele {{discovered}} that a new acid, tungstic acid, could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> scheelite (at the time named tungsten). Scheele and Torbern Bergman suggested {{that it might be}} possible to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid. In 1783, José and Fausto Elhuyar found an acid made from wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid. Later that year, at the Royal Basque Society in the town of Bergara, Spain, the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten by reduction of this acid with charcoal, and they are credited with the discovery of the element.|$|E
5|$|Invasive {{measures}} include electrocorticography, {{which uses}} electrodes placed {{directly on the}} exposed surface of the brain. This method is used in cortical stimulation mapping, {{used in the study}} of the relationship between cortical areas and their systemic function. By using much smaller microelectrodes, single-unit recordings can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> a single neuron that give a high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. This has enabled the linking of brain activity to behaviour, and the creation of neuronal maps.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{invention}} of the electric telegraph in 1835 that the modern age of weather forecasting began. Before that, the fastest that distant weather reports could travel was around 100 miles per day (160km/d), but was more typically 40–75 miles per day (60–120km/day) (whether by land or by sea). By the late 1840s, the telegraph allowed reports of weather conditions from a wide area to be received almost instantaneously, allowing forecasts to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> knowledge of weather conditions further upwind.|$|E
5|$|Many {{other types}} of {{tessellation}} are possible under different constraints. For example, there are eight types of semi-regular tessellation, made {{with more than one}} kind of regular polygon but still having the same arrangement of polygons at every corner. Irregular tessellations can also <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> other shapes such as pentagons, polyominoes and in fact almost any kind of geometric shape. The artist M. C. Escher is famous for making tessellations with irregular interlocking tiles, shaped like animals and other natural objects. If suitable contrasting colours are chosen for the tiles of differing shape, striking patterns are formed, and these can be used to decorate physical surfaces such as church floors.|$|E
5|$|Maple syrup is a syrup {{usually made}} from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, {{although}} it can also <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before the winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.|$|E
