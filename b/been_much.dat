5|$|From {{the late}} twentieth century onwards, there has <b>been</b> <b>much</b> {{investigation}} of low-mass, radiative collectors; these have proved to be much more successful.|$|E
5|$|The sheep at {{this time}} would have <b>been</b> <b>much</b> more {{variable}} than modern breeds, which have been carefully selected for specific characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's {{personal}} {{religious convictions}} have <b>been</b> <b>much</b> debated by scholars. She was a Protestant, but kept Catholic symbols (such as the crucifix), and downplayed {{the role of}} sermons in defiance of a key Protestant belief.|$|E
50|$|Social {{stratification}} <b>is</b> <b>much</b> less rigid {{in northern}} coast area, which <b>is</b> <b>much</b> more egalitarian.|$|R
50|$|In a {{contrast}} to 2010, the course <b>was</b> <b>much</b> less sloppy and consequently, times <b>were</b> <b>much</b> faster.|$|R
50|$|For {{municipal}} water supply, {{the share of}} groundwater <b>is</b> <b>much</b> lower and the share of surface water <b>is</b> <b>much</b> greater. In 2009 Beijing had 19 water treatment plants, including many relatively small ones that treat groundwater, while surface water treatment plants <b>are</b> <b>much</b> larger.|$|R
5|$|Excavations at {{the site}} of Avaris by Manfred Bietak have shown that Ahmose had a palace {{constructed}} {{on the site of the}} former Hyksos capital city's fortifications. Bietak found fragmentary Minoan-style remains of the frescoes that once covered the walls of the palace; there has subsequently <b>been</b> <b>much</b> speculation as to what role this Aegean civilization may have played in terms of trade and in the arts.|$|E
5|$|For many {{communities}} {{the existence of}} buildings that formerly housed residential schools are a traumatic reminder of the system's legacy, and there has <b>been</b> <b>much</b> discussion about demolition, heritage status and how the possibility of incorporating sites into the healing process.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of {{both the}} Malagasy pygmy {{hippopotamus}} and H. lemerlei show a cursorial adaptation, distinct from the hippos on the African continent, {{and they would have}} <b>been</b> <b>much</b> better runners. This common trait is a possible indicator that both species of Malagasy hippo descended from a common ancestor, and that the similarities to the modern hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus are a case of parallel evolution.|$|E
60|$|Ibid. Burnet, {{speaking}} of the Earl of Clarendon's eldest son, who afterwards succeeded him, says:--His judgement was not to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> depended on, for he <b>was</b> <b>much</b> carried by vulgar prejudices, and false notions. He <b>was</b> <b>much</b> in the Queen's favour. Swift. Much, much, much.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{inscription}} {{on the narrow}} side of the stone (N210) <b>is</b> <b>much</b> longer and <b>is</b> <b>much</b> more startling: ...|$|R
50|$|Males {{are similar}} to Cotana lunulata, but are larger and the outer one-third of the {{forewings}} <b>is</b> <b>much</b> paler and more yellow. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>much</b> brighter yellow and all transverse lines are more distinct. Females are also similar to Cotana lunulata, but <b>are</b> <b>much</b> darker and the white patch in the basal one-third of the forewings is reduced to a small dot. The postdiscal bands <b>are</b> <b>much</b> narrower and more cream-coloured.|$|R
5|$|However, pay {{would have}} <b>been</b> <b>much</b> more {{attractive}} in higher-grade units. The {{top of the}} pay pyramid were the scholae elite cavalry regiments. Next came palatini units, then comitatenses, and finally limitanei. There is little evidence about the pay differentials between grades. But that they were substantial is shown by the example that an actuarius (quartermaster) of a comitatus regiment was paid 50% more than his counterpart in a pseudocomitatensis regiment.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also found}} in brackish-water {{habitats}} and is sometimes seen swimming in salt water. It has <b>been</b> <b>much</b> more successful at colonizing Atlantic and Gulf coast barrier islands than the copperhead. However, even on these islands, it tends to favor freshwater marshes. A study by Dunson and Freda (1985) describes it as not being particularly salt-tolerant.|$|E
5|$|Jain texts portray Mahavira as a {{very tall}} man, with his height stated to be seven cubits (10.5 feet) in Aupapatika Sutra. In Jain mythology, he was the {{shortest}} of the 24 Tirthankaras, with earlier teachers believed to have <b>been</b> <b>much</b> taller, with the 22nd Tirthankara Aristanemi, who lived for 1,000 years, stated to have been forty cubits tall (60feet).|$|E
50|$|Newer {{materials}} are being developed. One such, aluminium oxynitride, <b>is</b> <b>much</b> lighter but at US$10-15 {{per square inch}} <b>is</b> <b>much</b> more costly.|$|R
5000|$|The coat of a Pomeranian <b>is</b> {{generally}} <b>much</b> denser and thicker. It {{is often}} difficult to see individual hairs. However, an Indian Spitz's coat <b>is</b> <b>much</b> less dense and it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> easier to see the individual hair follicles.|$|R
50|$|Mecocerus wallacei {{exhibits}} a strong sexual dimorphism, as the males <b>are</b> <b>much</b> larger than females and the thread-like antennae <b>are</b> <b>much</b> {{longer than the}} body.|$|R
5|$|Reconstruction of the {{historical}} development of Vithoba worship has <b>been</b> <b>much</b> debated. In particular, several alternative theories have been proposed regarding the earliest stages, as well as the point at which he came to be recognised as a distinct deity. The Pandurangashtakam stotra, a hymn attributed to Adi Shankaracharya of the 8th century, indicates that Vithoba worship might have already existed at an early date.|$|E
5|$|There has <b>been</b> <b>much</b> {{speculation}} {{over the}} functions of Triceratops head adornments. The two main theories have revolved around use in combat, or display in courtship, with the latter thought now {{to be the most}} likely primary function.|$|E
5|$|Though Thomas wrote {{exclusively}} in the English language, he has been acknowledged {{as one of the}} most important Welsh poets of the 20th century. He is noted for his original, rhythmic and ingenious use of words and imagery. His position as one of the great modern poets has <b>been</b> <b>much</b> discussed, and he remains popular with the public.|$|E
50|$|The {{ministry}} of the apostle <b>is</b> <b>much</b> more relevant for salvation in the Southern hemisphere and the priesthood of all believers <b>is</b> <b>much</b> more neglected.|$|R
5000|$|Blade workstation: These {{solutions}} tend to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> {{more expensive}} than the traditional blade PCs, and befitting their more high-end specs, they <b>are</b> <b>much</b> more capable.|$|R
50|$|Acylation <b>is</b> <b>much</b> more {{straightforward}} as {{the resulting}} α-cyanocarbonyl compounds <b>are</b> <b>much</b> more acidic (and less nucleophilic) than corresponding starting materials. Monoacylated products {{can be obtained}} easily.|$|R
5|$|A Quistclose {{trust is}} a trust created where a {{creditor}} has lent {{money to a}} debtor for a particular purpose. In {{the event that the}} debtor uses the money for any other purpose, it is held on trust for the creditor. Any inappropriately spent money can then be traced, and returned to the creditors. The name and trust comes from the House of Lords decision in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd (1970), although the underlying principles can be traced back further. There has <b>been</b> <b>much</b> academic debate over the classification of Quistclose trusts in existing trusts law: whether they are resulting trusts, express trusts, constructive trusts or, as Lord Millett said in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley, illusory trusts.|$|E
5|$|After the tornado, {{there was}} an {{investigation}} into whether the students should have been dismissed before the tornado stuck the school. However, the National Weather Service survey from the office in Tallahassee suggested that the death toll could have <b>been</b> <b>much</b> higher due to the extreme damage {{in the parking lot}} and the area nearby. In addition, earlier thunderstorm activity in the area with two other rotating supercells tracking towards Enterprise late that morning (the first tornado warning was issued at 10:41am CST) made evacuating the area unsafe.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Eisenack's {{original}} {{description of}} the Chitinozoans placed them in three families, spanning seven genera, based on morphological grounds. Further genera were identified, at first on an annual basis, as time progressed. Since its publication in 1931, Eisenack's original classification has <b>been</b> <b>much</b> honed by these additional discoveries, as well as advances in microscopy. The advent of the scanning electron microscope in the 1970s allowed the improved detection of surface ornamentation which is hugely important in identification - as can be appreciated by {{a comparison of the}} images on this page. Even the light microscope image here is of far greater quality than could have been achieved earlier in the century, using poorly preserved specimens and less advanced microscopes.|$|E
50|$|It {{is similar}} to Lophostethus dumolinii, but smaller and {{the margin of the}} {{forewings}} <b>is</b> <b>much</b> less crenulated, the ground colour <b>is</b> <b>much</b> darker and more purplish and the stigmata is smaller and more golden. It <b>is</b> also <b>much</b> less heavily marked below.|$|R
50|$|Since penile and anal cancers <b>are</b> <b>much</b> {{less common}} than {{cervical}} cancer, HPV vaccination {{of young men}} is likely to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> less cost-effective than for young women.|$|R
6000|$|... "He'd {{be sure to}} know it," [...] said Mrs. Rowan, {{speaking}} {{of the young man}} as though he <b>were</b> <b>much</b> to <b>be</b> feared;--as indeed he <b>was</b> <b>much</b> feared by her.|$|R
5|$|Although {{classified}} as poisonous, reports of human deaths resulting from its ingestion are extremely rare. After parboiling—which weakens its toxicity and {{breaks down the}} mushroom's psychoactive substances—it is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Amanita muscaria is noted for its hallucinogenic properties, with its main psychoactive constituent being the compound muscimol. The mushroom {{was used as an}} intoxicant and entheogen by the peoples of Siberia, and has a religious significance in these cultures. There has <b>been</b> <b>much</b> speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such as the Middle East, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Another very ancient seat is the {{so-called}} “Chair of Dagobert” in the Louvre. It is of cast bronze, sharpened with the chisel and partially gilt; it is of the curule or faldstool type and supported upon legs terminating in the heads and feet of animals. The seat, which was probably of leather, has disappeared. Its attribution depends entirely upon the statement of Suger, abbot of St Denis in the 12th century, who added a back and arms. Its age has <b>been</b> <b>much</b> discussed, but Viollet-le-Duc dated it to early Merovingian times, and it may in any case be taken as the oldest faldstool in existence.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the vague}} {{language}} of the document, there has <b>been</b> <b>much</b> scholarly debate over {{how it should be}} interpreted. John Maddicott saw the wording as a hostile warning to the new king to avoid the mistakes of his father, or face the consequences. J. R. S. Phillips, on the other hand, took the signatories to be positively inclined towards Edward II. There were others who were more intrinsic in their opposition to the king and Gaveston, primarily the Earl of Warwick. The purpose of the document, in Phillips view, was to present the king with a warning, and hopefully protect him against the more antagonistic members of the nobility.|$|E

50|$|Motorcycles <b>are</b> <b>much</b> less {{protected}} than cars, so any {{accident that}} might occur would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> worse, especially since frequent interchanges with complex traffic flows increase the dangers to motorcyclists.|$|R
50|$|Compared {{to other}} tiger spiders, this species <b>is</b> <b>much</b> more docile, but in extreme disturbances, will bite. However, spiderlings {{are known to}} <b>be</b> <b>much</b> {{stronger}} jumpers and strike faster than adults.|$|R
