The more massive AGB stars may undergo a <b>brief</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> carbon fusion before the core becomes degenerate.|$|E

5|$|In 1451, Mehmed {{was focused}} on {{defeating}} the Karamanids and Menteşe in the East, {{but it was in}} his intentions to return to Albania. During this <b>brief</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> rest, Skanderbeg took up the rebuilding of Krujë and erected a new fortress in Modrica in the Drin Valley near Svetigrad (which had been lost in a 1448 siege) where Turkish forces had previously slipped through unhindered. The fortress was constructed in the heat of summer within a few months when few Turkish posts were present. This came as a huge blow to Ottoman efforts whose Albanian operations were thus inhibited.|$|E

The Wodeyars were patrons of art and culture and contributed {{significantly}} to the cultural growth {{of the city and the}} state.

5|$|Since all PID bytes include four 0bits, {{they leave}} the bus in the full-bandwidth Kstate, {{which is the same}} as the low-bandwidth Jstate.

Then a low-bandwidth packet follows, beginning with a sync sequence and PID byte, and ending with a <b>brief</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> SE0. Full-bandwidth devices other than hubs can simply ignore the PRE packet and its low-bandwidth contents, until the final SE0 indicates that a new packet follows.|$|E
