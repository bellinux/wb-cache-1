40|$|A case is {{reported}} of a 36 -year-old male, {{found dead in}} his locked room, lying on a bed, dressed in his mother 2 ̆ 7 s clothes, with a plastic bag over his head, hands tied and with a <b>barrel</b> <b>wooden</b> cork in his rectum. Two pornographic magazines were found on a chair near the bed, so that the deceased could see them well. Asphyxia was controlled with a complex apparatus which consisted of two elastic luggage rack straps, the first surrounding his waist, perineum, and buttocks, and the second {{the back of his}} body, and neck. According to the psychological autopsy based on a structured interview (SCID-I, SCID-II) with his father, the deceased was single, unemployed and with a part college education. He had grown up in a poor family with a reserved father and dominant mother, and was indicative of fulfilling DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence, paraphilia involving hypoxyphilia with transvestic fetishism and anal masturbation and a borderline personality disorder. There was no evidence of previous psychiatric treatment. The Circumstances subscale of Beck’s Suicidal Intent Scale (SIS-CS) pointed at the lack of final acts (thoughts or plans) in anticipation of death, and absence of a suicide note or overt communication of suicidal intent before death. Integration of the crime scene data with those of the forensic medicine and psychological autopsy enabled identification of the event as an accidental death, caused by neck strangulation, suffocation by a plastic bag, and vagal stimulation due to a foreign body in the rectum...|$|E

50|$|During the 20th century, sake-brewing {{technology}} grew by {{leaps and}} bounds. The government opened the sake-brewing research institute in 1904, and in 1907 the very first government-run sake-tasting competition was held. Yeast strains specifically selected for their brewing properties were isolated and enamel-coated steel tanks arrived. The government started hailing the use of enamel tanks as easy to clean, lasting forever, and being devoid of bacterial problems. (The government considered <b>wooden</b> <b>barrels</b> to be unhygienic {{because of the potential}} bacteria living in the wood.) Although these things are true, the government also wanted more tax money from breweries, as using <b>wooden</b> <b>barrels</b> means that a significant amount of sake is lost to evaporation (somewhere around 3%), which could have otherwise been taxed. This {{was the end of the}} wooden-barrel age of sake and the use of <b>wooden</b> <b>barrels</b> in brewing was completely eliminated.|$|R
