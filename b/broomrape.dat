Floral VOC blend-based phylogeny supported the known taxonomy in internal taxonomic grouping of genus and eliminated the uncertainty in some taxonomical groups. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis suggested separation of the <b>broomrapes</b> into two main groups parasitizing annual and perennial hosts, and for the annual hosts, into weedy and non-weedy <b>broomrapes.</b> We conclude that floral VOCs are a significant tool in species identification and possibly even in defining new species and can help to improve controversial taxonomy in the Orobanchaceae. </p...|$|R

40|$|The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press {{on behalf}} of the Annals of Botany Company. Background and Aims The <b>broomrapes,</b> Orobanche sensu lato (Orobanchaceae), are common root parasites found across Eurasia, Africa and the Americas. All species native to the western hemisphere, {{recognized}} as Orobanche sections Gymnocaulis and Nothaphyllon, form a clade that has a centre of diversity in western North America, but also includes four disjunct species in central and southern South America. The wide ecological distribution coupled with moderate taxonomic diversity make this clade a valuable model system for studying the role, if any, of host-switching in driving the diversification of plant parasites. Methods Two spacer regions of ribosomal nuclear DNA (ITS + ETS), three plastid regions and one low-copy nuclear gene were sampled from 163 exemplars of Orobanche from across the native geographic range in order to infer a detailed phylogeny. Together with comprehensive data on the parasites' native host ranges, associations between phylogenetic lineages and host specificity are tested. Key Results Within the two currently recognized species of O. sect. Gymnocaulis, seven strongly supported clades were found. While commonly sympatric, members of these clades each had unique host associations. Strong support for cryptic host-specific diversity was also found in sect. Nothaphyllon, while other taxonomic species were well supported. We also find strong evidence for multiple amphitropical dispersals from central North America into South America. Conclusions Host-switching is an important driver of diversification in western hemisphere <b>broomrapes,</b> where host specificity has been grossly underestimated. More broadly, host specificity and host-switching probably play fundamental roles in the speciation of parasitic plants...|$|R

40|$|Root {{parasitic}} plant {{species such as}} <b>broomrapes</b> (Orobanche and Phelipanche spp.) and witchweeds (Striga spp.) are notorious agricultural weeds. They cause damage to crops by depriving them of water, nutrients and assimilates via a vascular connection. The difficulty in controlling root parasitic weeds {{is largely due to}} their intricate lifecycle and partially underground lifestyle. Their life cycle includes processes such as germination of the seed, the formation of the vascular connection with the host, the growth and development of the parasite after attachment and the emergence of shoots and flowers aboveground. The germination of many {{parasitic plant}}s is induced by strigolactones that were recently shown to also be signalling compounds that stimulate mycorrhizal symbiosis. In addition, in the past few years, their role in plant development and plant defense has been established revealing them as a new class of plant hormones that exert their function likely in interaction with other hormones...|$|R

40|$|<b>Broomrapes</b> are {{parasitic}} plants without chlorophyll, nutritionally depending {{from their}} host plant. Orobanche ramosa L. is a parasite of numerous plants including winter oilseed rape. Its presence {{has been reported}} {{for a long time}} in the South of France.

The main extension factors are its ability to produce seeds, its wide ability to germinate in different environmental conditions, its large number of potential host plants, including common weeds present in cropped fields. Short term recommendations intend to favour the host in the nutritional competition and to limit the soil seed bank.
