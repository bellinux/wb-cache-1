40|$|AbstractIt is {{difficult}} to predict the <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> by kink analysis in steady aerodynamic parameter curves such as the lift coefficient curves, pitching moment coefficient curves and trailing edge pressure coefficient curves at a certain flow conditions. Thus, a maximum curvature method is proposed {{which is based on}} the aerodynamic parameter data, to find the <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> point at which the curve curvature achieves an extreme. The method is to fit a fourth order polynomial using the aerodynamic parameter data calculated by steady N-S equation. Subsequently, curvature analysis is carried on with the fitted curve and the stationary point in a particular interval of the curve is obtained. And this point is regarded as the <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> point. This method can be applied to predict the transonic <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> for airfoils based on steady aerodynamic parameters and good agreement is achieved with the comparison of predicted results and wind tunnel test data...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{turbulent}} transition on {{the onset of the}} transonic buffeting over the supercritical LV 2 F aerofoil is numerically investigated in the paper. The in-house RANS code validation has been done on 14 % and 18 % thick biconvex aerofoils {{as well as on the}} NACA 0012 aerofoil. The importance in the results accuracy of both turbulence modelling and shock capturing approach employed is pointed out. The numerical results are compared with the most accurate CFD studies accomplished in the field of the transonic periodic flow. The RANS turbulent methodology appears to be particularly well adapted for transonic buffeting investigation where the flows strongly depend on the turbulence structure in the relatively thin boundary layer leading up to separation. The {{effect of the}} turbulent transition on <b>buffeting</b> <b>onset</b> and development can be understood as a flow control technique leading in particular conditions to complete alleviation of shock oscillations.

40|$|A CFD {{sensitivity}} analysis is conducted for an aircraft at several conditions, including flow with substantial separation (<b>buffet</b> <b>onset).</b> The sensitivity is studied using two different Navier-Stokes computer codes, three different turbulence models, and two different grid treatments {{of the wing}} trailing edge. This effort is a follow-on to an earlier study of CFD variation over a different aircraft in <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> conditions. Similar to the earlier study, the turbulence model is found to have the largest effect, with a variation of 3. 8 % in lift at the <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> angle of attack. Drag and moment variation are 2. 9 % and 23. 6 %, respectively. The variations due to code and trailing edge cap grid are smaller than that due to turbulence model. Overall, the combined approximate error band in CFD due to code, turbulence model, and trailing edge treatment at the <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> angle of attack are: 4 % in lift, 3 % in drag, and 31 % in moment. The CFD results show similar trends to flight test data, but also exhibit a lift curve break not seen in the data...|$|E
40|$|A flight {{program was}} {{conducted}} on the F- 104 airplane to investigate the effects of moderate deflections of wing leading- and trailing-edge flaps on the buffet characteristics at subsonic and transonic Mach numbers. Selected deflections of the wing leading and trailing-edge flaps, individually and in combination, were used to assess <b>buffet</b> <b>onset,</b> intensity, and frequency; lift curves; and wing-rock characteristics for each configuration. Increased deflection of the trailing-edge flap delayed the <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> and buffet intensity rise to a significantly higher airplane normal-force coefficient. Deflection of the leading-edge flap produced some delay in <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> and the resulting intensity rise at low subsonic speeds. Increased deflection of the trailing-edge flap provided appreciable lift increments in the angle-of-attack range covered, whereas the leading-edge flap provided lift increments only at high angles-of-attack.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) sensitivity analysis is conducted for a modern civil transport at several conditions ranging from mostly attached flow to flow with substantial separation. Two different Navier-Stokes computer codes and four different turbulence models are utilized, and results are compared both to wind tunnel data at flight Reynolds number and flight data. In-depth CFD sensitivities to grid, code, spatial differencing method, aeroelastic shape, and turbulence model are described for conditions near <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> (a condition at which significant separation exists). In summary, given a grid of sufficient density for a given aeroelastic wing shape, the combined approximate error band in CFD at conditions near <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> due to code, spatial differencing method, and turbulence model is: 6 % in lift, 7 % in drag, and 16 % in moment. The biggest two contributers to this uncertainty are turbulence model and code.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current work is to {{determine}} the <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> boundary {{in the case of an}} airliner type of wind tunnel model having a presumably laminar wing. A complex wind tunnel campaign took place, providing an important amount of data from a variety of sensors: steady and non-steady pressure sensors, strain gauges and accelerometer. The last two types of sensors are useful for buffeting investigation, which is the structural vibration and are considered to provide global indications. Pressure signals are providing local indications and also global when properly integrated in global indices.

40|$|During {{conceptual}} design a problem arises when predicting the <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> boundary. Due {{to the pressure}} on payload-range and cruise altitude capability, improvement on the <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> boundary is often of great importance. It {{is one of the}} primary constraints in establishing the low and transonic speed performance capabilities of transport aircraft. Buffeting, a high-frequency instability caused by airflow separation or shock wave oscillation, {{can be seen as a}} random forced vibration. Depending on the angle of attack and freestream velocity, the separations in the flow can result in an aerodynamic excitation. The main motivation for this thesis research is to create a more advanced but fast transonic <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> prediction tool to permit greater design freedom during the {{conceptual design}} phase. This implies this tool should be faster than conventional tools, it should be reliable and able to deal with unconventional configurations. In addition, it should be built in a modular way so it is easy to use, alter and replace parts of the tool. The transonic buffet prediction tool was demonstrated using the Fokker 100 wing-fuselage combination test case. A modular transonic <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> prediction tool was successfully developed by combing a Vortex-Lattice method, 2 -dimensional Euler code, a critical pressure rise separation criterion and the Matrix-V code program. It is approximately 90 % faster with respect to the use of only the Matrix-V code and it is reliable in the region left of the coffin corner at high CL and low Mach number combinations. The expected error in the regime which can be correctly predicted by this tool is in the order of 0. 05 With respect to further use of this tool, it is most interesting to see how this transonic buffet prediction tool behaves when less conventional wing geometries such as a flying wing, blended wing body, or Prandtl plane are tested.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the work done}} to implement new computational tools and methods dedicated to aircraft conceptual design sizing and optimization. These tools have been exercised on different aircraft concepts in order to validate them and assess their relevance and applicability to practical cases. First, a geometry construction protocol has been developed. It is indeed essential to have a geometry description that supports the derivation of all discretizations and idealizations used by the different analysis modules (aerodynamics, weights and balance, stability and control, etc.) for which an aircraft concept is evaluated. The geometry should also be intuitive to the user, general enough to describe {{a wide array of}} morphologies and suitable for optimization. All these conditions are fulfilled by an appropriate parameterization of the geometry. In addition, a tool named CADac (Computer Aided Design aircraft) has been created in order to produce automatically a closed and consistent CAD solid model of the designs under study. The produced CAD model is easily meshable and therefore high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) computations can be performed effortlessly without need for tedious and time-consuming post-CAD geometry repair. Second, an unsteady vortex-lattice method based on TORNADO has been implemented in order to enlarge to scope of flight conditions that can be analyzed. It has been validated satisfactorily for the sudden acceleration of a flat plate {{as well as for the}} static and dynamic derivatives of the Saab 105 /SK 60. Finally, a methodology has been developed to compute quickly in a semi-empirical way the buffet envelope of new aircraft geometries at the conceptual stage. The parameters that demonstrate functional sensitivity to <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> have been identified and their relative effect quantified. The method uses a combination of simple sweep theory and fractional change theory as well as the <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> of a seed aircraft or a provided generic <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> to estimate the buffet envelope of any target geometry. The method proves to be flexible and robust enough to predict within mainly 5 % (and in any case 9 %) the <b>buffet</b> <b>onset</b> for a wide variety of aircrafts, from regional turboprop to long-haul wide body or high-speed business jets.
