50|$|The RTL is a truck {{prime mover}} with railway wheels {{that can be}} lowered when {{operating}} on the railway tracks. It was pioneered by in the early 1990s by Australian National and later refined in Victoria. The idea {{was to have a}} locomotive that could transfer from one <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> <b>carrying</b> mainly wheat to another parallel <b>branch</b> <b>line,</b> where the rail connection is very roundabout. The RTL suffered a number of disadvantages. Loads were severely limited when the track was steeply graded. The rubber traction wheels slipped on the steel rails when wet. The life of the rubber tires was rather short.|$|R
25|$|A double {{junction}} is a railway junction where a double track railway splits into two double track lines. Usually, one {{line is the}} main <b>line</b> and <b>carries</b> traffic through the junction at normal speed, while the other track is a <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> that <b>carries</b> traffic through the junction at reduced speed.|$|R

50|$|In 1957 the West Coast Champion began hauling thru-cars for the City of Miami and South Wind streamliners to {{and from}} Chicago on its Jacksonville-Tampa/Sarasota leg via Orlando and its Jacksonville-St. Petersburg section via Gainesville and Ocala. During its long {{successful}} career the Champion network reached virtually every major city and resort in the Sunshine State except Florida Panhandle cities like Pensacola and Tallahassee, which were served by Seaboard's Jacksonville-New Orleans overnight Gulf Wind. The East Coast Champion ran {{up and down the}} Florida East Coast Railway stopping at popular east coast resorts. The Gulf coast <b>branch</b> <b>lines</b> <b>carried</b> West Coast Champion thru-cars to three different branches, one to Bradenton and Sarasota, a second to St. Petersburg, and a third to Ft. Myers and Naples.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} by the Oxford & District Gas Company in 1886 for a short railway <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> to <b>carry</b> coal to the gas works from the main Cherwell Valley Line at a junction just south of Osney Rail Bridge. The bridge was built by assembling sections on the south {{bank of the river}} and floating them into position. The gas works was demolished in 1960; no evidence of the railway line is visible on the footbridge.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} improve the railway {{connection}} to the centre of Neu-Isenburg, a <b>branch</b> <b>line,</b> which was about 2.2 km long, was commissioned to {{the southern part of}} the town on 20 March 1902. The line was single track and ran to a freight yard with six tracks. The southernmost of these tracks had two manually operated turntables, which connected to industrial sidings. This <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> only <b>carried</b> freight because the Frankfurt Forest Railway (Frankfurter Waldbahn,) already provided a connection from Neu-Isenburg to Frankfurt for passengers (now line 14 of the Frankfurt trams). At the end of 2006 this (never electrified) <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> was closed and the tracks were later partly removed.|$|R
50|$|Haddington {{sits on the}} A1 dual-carriageway linking Edinburgh with London. The town is {{currently}} served by the bus companies Perrymans, Prentice Coaches, Eve Coaches and Lothian Country Buses. These buses allow travel to Edinburgh, Berwick-upon-Tweed, and other towns and villages in East Lothian. With the withdrawal of many First Scotland East services in June 2012, the contracts for the 121 Haddington to North Berwick and the 123 Gifford Circle passed back to the Haddington- based firm Prentice Coaches. Haddington was served by a railway <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> which <b>carried</b> passengers from 1846 until 1949.|$|R
50|$|In General Madariaga Partido (which {{included}} {{cities of}} Villa Gesell and Pinamar by that point) the Roca Railway owned a freight <b>line</b> <b>branch</b> that <b>carried</b> firewood to the dunes zone {{at the entrance}} to Pinamar. In 1943, the city of Pinamar was opened as a tourist centre.|$|R
50|$|In the {{residential}} {{portion of the}} town, housing types are standardized, {{with three or four}} basic types corresponding to different positions in the railroad hierarchy. The commercial district, while lacking a street for much of its history, boasted two hotels, two banks, {{and a number of other}} commercial buildings. The railroad station was built in 1888, while a railyard and shops served the extensive <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> network which <b>carried</b> coal out of the hills.|$|R
40|$|The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem and its higher {{dimensional}} generalizations by Oshikawa and Hastings {{require that}} translationally invariant 2 D spin systems with a half-integer spin per unit cell must either have {{a continuum of}} low energy excitations, spontaneously break some symmetries, or exhibit topological order with anyonic excitations. We establish a connection between these constraints and a remarkably similar set of constraints at {{the surface of a}} 3 D interacting topological insulator. This, combined with recent work on symmetry-enriched topological phases (SETs) with on-site unitary symmetries, enables us to develop a framework for understanding the structure of SETs with both translational and on-site unitary symmetries, including the effective theory of symmetry defects. This framework places stringent constraints on the possible types of symmetry fractionalization that can occur in 2 D systems whose unit cell contains fractional spin, fractional charge, or a projective representation of the symmetry group. As a concrete application, we determine when a topological phase must possess a "spinon" excitation, even in cases when spin rotational invariance is broken down to a discrete subgroup by the crystal structure. We also describe the phenomena of "anyonic spin-orbit coupling", which may arise from the interplay of translational and on-site symmetries. These include the possibility of on-site symmetry defect <b>branch</b> <b>lines</b> <b>carrying</b> topological charge per unit length and lattice dislocations inducing on-site symmetry protected degeneracies.

50|$|The {{house has}} two main <b>branches.</b> The senior <b>line,</b> <b>carrying</b> the title Duke of Berwick and {{residing}} in Spain, {{is the result}} of the 1st Duke's marriage to Honora Burke, Countess of Lucan. This line has collected many titles throughout their history, including a few grandeeships of Spain, with some activity as ambassadors and military generals. The line associated with France, derived from the 1st Duke's second marriage to an Englishwoman, Anne Bulkeley, carried the title Duke of Fitz-James.|$|R
50|$|In 1885, {{two months}} after the {{completion}} of the Franconian Forest Railway, a 7.6 kilometre long Sekundärbahn branch was opened that ran from the Upper Franconian town of Ludwigsstadt to the south Thuringian village of Lehesten. The slate quarries at Lehesten, which in 1880 manufactured 646,226 zentners of roofing and housing slates as well as slate tables, were particularly interested in a railway connexion. A state treaty between the Kingdom of Bavaria und the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen was required, however, to establish the line; this was signed on 16 June 1884. The brunt of the cost (0.515 million marks) was borne by Saxe-Meiningen, the construction and operation of the <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> was <b>carried</b> out by the Royal Bavarian State Railways. Construction began in September 1884 and the line was opened on 1 December 1885.|$|R

500|$|Coaching {{stock was}} {{originally}} claret but in 1875 {{was changed to}} Victoria Brown and white (except for <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> trains which <b>carried</b> an all over Victoria Brown livery) with gold and blue lining. [...] Victoria Brown was the same red brown colour as Longbottom had introduced for NSR locomotives. [...] In 1882 waist panels were additionally painted white. [...] This colour scheme lasted until 1896 when it was changed to an overall Victoria Lake (brown) colour with gold and blue lining. Adams changed the livery to Madder Lake in 1903 to match the locomotives, the lining became yellow and red. [...] A final minor change was to paint the waist panels of first class compartments cream to distinguish them. A constant presence was the company coat of arms being displayed on the coach sides.|$|R

In the {{immediate}} vicinity is the Experimenta Heilbronn, a science centre. A few metres later the Stadtbahn crosses the Friedrich Ebert bridge over the Neckar. The route now follows Kaiserstraße and {{in the vicinity of}} the marketplace is the Rathaus ("town hall") stop. At its eastern end, Kaiserstraße meets the Allee, where the northern <b>branch</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>lines</b> S41 and S42 turns off to the north along the Allee from the original east-west Stadtbahn line.
