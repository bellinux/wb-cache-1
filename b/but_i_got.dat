I {{probably}} shouldn't {{have done that}} picture, but I saw tons and tons of possibilities for things I loved, {{and this was the}} structure to do them in.

[...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5-star rating, but noted: [...] "While the rarity value of this music certainly makes it interesting, the music itself is pretty average, with the dreck outweighing the good stuff." ...|$|E

The song also features two lines by Diddy ("Hey, what up girl?" [...] and [...] "Let's go!") Lyrically, the song speaks about [...] "excess pleasures, from drinking ('Ain't got a {{care in the}} world <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> plenty of beer') to men ('We kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger')."

In an interview with the Daily Record, she explained, [...] "I'm not a big fan of [...] <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the line about things getting strange for Mulder and Scully from watching the odd episode". After questioning, she later said that she would [...] "prefer to go out for {{a night on the town}} with Gazza and Chris Evans than meet [...] stars Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny".

500|$|This was actor Cheyenne Jackson's second {{appearance}} as Danny on 30 Rock. He made his {{debut in the}} November 12, 2009, episode [...] "The Problem Solvers". Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees, the latter that starred Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna Maroney on the show. According to Jackson in a November 2009 interview, Fey {{set up a meeting}} to interest him in a role on the program. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, it was revealed that it was Krakowski who brought Jackson {{to the attention of the}} 30 Rock producers. In the episode, Danny sang off-key during a duet with Jenna, in order to keep her happy. In regards of his off-pitch performance, Jackson said in an interview, [...] "It's actually harder than you might think.

[...] Jagger said of the lyrics, [...] "It's weird where your lyric things come from. On Tumbling Dice, I {{sat down with the}} house keeper and talked to her about gambling. She liked to play dice and I really didn't know much about it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> it off her and managed to make the song out of that." [...] He concluded, [...] " [...] 'Tumbling Dice' [...] " [...] was written to fit Keith's riff. It's about gambling and love, an old blues track." ...|$|E
500|$|After three minutes, Madonna {{performs}} a rap naming {{the people who}} are working for her. Basically, we [...] had recorded the whole song and we had this instrumental thing at the end," [...] said Madonna, [...] "and Mirwais was like, 'You know what, you have to go and do a rap.' And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it.

Professional wrestlers Andrew [...] "Test" [...] Martin and Oleg [...] "Vladimir Kozlov" [...] Prudius also featured, plus Olja Hrustic, Meriah Nelson, and Lorielle New as the Werewolf Women. According to Zombie, [...] "Basically, I had two ideas. It was {{either going to}} be a Nazi movie or a women-in-prison film, and I went with the Nazis. There're all those movies like Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS; Fräulein Devil; and Love Camp 7—I've always found that to be the most bizarre genre." [...] Zombie is also quoted as saying [...] "I was getting very {{conceptual}} in my own mind with it. [...] A lot of times these movies would be made like, 'Well, you know, I've got a whole bunch of Nazi uniforms, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> this Chinese set too. We'll put 'em together!'

500|$|Ultimately, Lee {{spent over}} {{two and a}} half years writing To Kill a Mockingbird. The book was {{published}} on July 11, 1960. After rejecting the [...] "Watchman" [...] title, it was initially re-titled Atticus, but Lee renamed it [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird" [...] to reflect that the story went beyond just a character portrait. The editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies. In 1964, Lee recalled her hopes for the book when she said, [...] "I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird.'...I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but, at the same time, I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected." [...] Instead of a [...] "quick and merciful death", Reader's Digest Condensed Books chose the book for reprinting in part, which gave it a wide readership immediately. Since the original publication, the book has never been out of print.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film a perfect four-star rating, calling it [...] "the most cheerfully exciting, bizarre, goofy, romantic {{adventure}} movie since Raiders, {{and it is}} high praise to say that it's {{not so much a}} sequel as an equal. It's quite an experience." [...] Vincent Canby felt the film was [...] "too shapeless to be the fun that Raiders is, but shape may be beside the point. Old-time, 15-part movie serials didn't have shape. They just went on and on and on, which is what Temple of Doom does with humor and technical invention." [...] Neal Gabler commented that [...] "I think in some ways, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was better than Raiders of the Lost Ark. In some ways it was less. In sum total, I'd have to say I enjoyed it more. That doesn't mean it's better necessarily, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> more enjoyment out of it." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune called the film [...] "sillier, darkly violent and a bit dumbed down, but still great fun." [...] Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, claimed it was [...] "one of the most sheerly pleasurable physical comedies ever made." [...] Halliwell's Film Guide described the film as a [...] "slow-starting adventure romp with much ingenuity and too much brutality and horror." ...|$|E

500|$|Actress Natalie Dormer, who {{was cast}} to play Queen Margaery Tyrell in the show's second season, also made her final {{appearance}} {{as a main}} cast member for the series. In contrast to Chapman, Dormer found out about her character's impending death approximately {{six months before the}} rest of the cast, saying [...] "I requested while making season 5 that showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss release me from working on the show earlier than usual so I could do another project, and they ended up phoning me — and that was The Call. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> it six months ahead of normal. They were like, 'We weren't going to tell you this for a few more months, but we're not going to release you now, so you can't do that job {{you really want to do}} and we're really sorry about that. But on the bright side, we are going to release you proper in the not-so-distant future.' It was good news, bad news — no you can't do this, but don't worry, you're going to have lots more opportunities very soon." [...] Dormer also stated about her departure, [...] "It's the longest time I've ever spent playing a character. I'll always have a little yellow rose after my heart, and I think it was just the right length of time, to be honest. It's time for the Westeros story to move on and it's a perfect time for her to exit." ...|$|E
500|$|American Life is {{suffused with}} Ahmadzaï's {{characteristic}} production techniques, like stuttering instruments and vocals, oscillating loop tones recalling 1950s Sonar pulses, morphing vocals consisting of grunts and squeals and treatments {{that make the}} music freeze in between rhythms. The producer hoped that using stuttering would become a rage in the future world of recording. He believed that people think it is not natural to skip and stutter the music. But he used it {{to create a new}} groove. With the help of Pro Tools, he froze the audio at any point he wanted to change the rhythm of the tracks. Madonna discussed the recording of the title track stating that Ahmadzaï had encouraged her to rap spontaneously, about all the materialistic objects that she herself had been using and doing. They had an instrumental breakdown in [...] "American Life", where the producer encouraged Madonna to add a rap about her everyday life. [...] "Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like'.
