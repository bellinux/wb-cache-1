500|$|Wild grains were {{collected}} and eaten {{from at least}} 20,000 BC. From around 9,500 BC, the eight Neolithic founder crops—emmer wheat, einkorn wheat, [...] hulled barley, peas, lentils, <b>bitter</b> <b>vetch,</b> chick peas, and flax—were cultivated in the Levant. Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC, followed by mung, soy and azuki beans. Pigs were domesticated in Mesopotamia around 11,000 BC, followed by sheep between 11,000 and 9,000 BC. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs {{in the areas of}} modern Turkey and Pakistan around 8,500 BC. Sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 7,000 BC. Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 5,000 BC. In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 8,000 and 5,000 BC, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Bananas were cultivated and hybridized in the same period in Papua New Guinea. In Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was domesticated to maize by 4,000 BC. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 3,600 BC. Camels were domesticated late, perhaps around 3,000 BC.|$|E
2500|$|In the cities, fresh {{vegetables}} were expensive, and therefore, the poorer city dwellers {{had to make}} do with dried vegetables. Lentil soup ( [...] phakē) was the workman's typical dish. Cheese, garlic, and onions were the soldier's traditional fare. In Aristophanes' Peace, the smell of onions typically represents soldiers; the chorus, celebrating the end of war, sings Oh! joy, joy! No more helmet, no more cheese nor onions! <b>Bitter</b> <b>vetch</b> ( [...] orobos) was considered a famine food.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{agriculture}} {{is believed to}} have originated and become widespread in Southwest Asia around 10,000–9,000 BP, though earlier individual sites have been identified. The Fertile Crescent region of Southwest Asia is the centre of domestication for three cereals (einkorn wheat, emmer wheat and barley), four legumes (lentil, pea, <b>bitter</b> <b>vetch</b> and chickpea) and flax. The Mediterranean climate consists of a long dry season with a short period of rain, which may have favored small plants with large seeds, like wheat and barley. The Fertile Crescent also had a large area of varied geographical settings and altitudes and this variety may have made agriculture more profitable for former hunter-gatherers in this region in comparison with other areas with a similar climate [...]|$|E
2500|$|Agriculture began {{independently}} {{in different}} parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago. Pigs were domesticated in Mesopotamia around 15,000 years ago. Rice was domesticated in China between 13,500 and 8,200 years ago, followed by mung, soy and azuki beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. From around 11,500 years ago, the eight Neolithic founder crops, emmer and einkorn wheat, [...] hulled barley, peas, lentils, <b>bitter</b> <b>vetch,</b> chick peas and flax were cultivated in the Levant. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago. In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. [...] Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago, and was independently domesticated in Eurasia at an unknown time. In Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was domesticated to maize by 6,000 years ago.|$|E
2500|$|Several plant species, the [...] "pioneer crops" [...] or Neolithic founder crops, were {{identified}} by Daniel Zohary, who highlighted {{the importance of the}} three cereals, and suggested that domestication of flax, peas, chickpeas, <b>bitter</b> <b>vetch</b> and lentils came a little later. Based on analysis of the genes of domesticated plants, he preferred theories of a single, or at most {{a very small number of}} domestication events for each taxon that spread in an arc from the Levantine corridor around the Fertile Crescent and later into Europe. Gordon Hillman and Stuart Davies carried out experiments with wild wheat varieties to show that the process of domestication would have occurred over a relatively short period of between 20 and 200 years. Some of these pioneering attempts failed at first and crops were abandoned, sometimes to be taken up again and successfully domesticated thousands of years later: rye, tried and abandoned in Neolithic Anatolia, made its way to Europe as weed seeds and was successfully domesticated in Europe, thousands of years after the earliest agriculture. Wild lentils presented a different problem: most of the wild seeds do not germinate in the first year; the first evidence of lentil domestication, breaking dormancy in their first year, was found in the early Neolithic at Jerf el Ahmar (in modern Syria), and quickly spread south to the Netiv HaGdud site in the Jordan Valley. This process of domestication allowed the founder crops to adapt and eventually become larger, more easily harvested, more dependable in storage and more useful to the human population.|$|E
50|$|The grain when split resembles red lentils. For human {{consumption}} {{the bitterness of}} the seeds needs to be removed through leaching by several changes of boiling water. Owing to this bitterness, {{it is unlikely that}} someone would accidentally confuse <b>bitter</b> <b>vetch</b> with red lentils. According to Zohary and Hopf, only humans of the poorest economic classes consume this crop, or in times of famine; however, Pliny the Elder states that <b>bitter</b> <b>vetch</b> (ervum) has medicinal value like vetch (vicia), citing the letters of Augustus where the emperor wrote that he regained his health from a diet of <b>bitter</b> <b>vetch</b> (N.H. 18.38).|$|E

5000|$|The {{importance}} of legumes in ancient Greek diet and medical practice is often disregarded. However, legumes improved {{the quality of}} the soil and were considered very important to the agriculturalists of the time. Additionally, legumes contain a high amount of albumen, which led them to be a critical dietary supplement in countries where meat was in short supply and difficult to store. Such was the case with Greece. People in the Graeco-Roman world consumed less meat than we do today and therefore, legumes were a necessary source of protein. Of all legumes, the lentil [...] appears most frequently in Greek and Roman literature. Medicinally, Hippocrates recommends lentils as a remedy for ulcers and hemorrhoids. <b>Bitter</b> <b>vetch,</b> or Vicia ervilia, was also an important legume in ancient Greek medicine. The extensive medicinal qualities of the <b>bitter</b> <b>vetch</b> were thought reliable enough to later administer to Roman emperors such as Augustus. <b>Bitter</b> <b>vetch</b> was thought to heal pimples, prevent sores from spreading and soothe spots or sores when they appear on the breasts. It was also reported to relieve painful urination, flatulence, liver problems, and indigestion when roasted and mixed with honey and Hippocrates cautioned that when eaten boiled or raw, the consumption of <b>bitter</b> <b>vetch</b> may cause more flatulence or pain.|$|E

The larvae are green and well camouflaged on their food plant. Pupation takes place at the end of July in surrounding scrub and it is this stage which overwinters.|$|E
50|$|The {{carbonised}} {{remains of}} einkorn, emmer and some barley have been found.

A micro-moth, Pammene trauniana, can be found - also dippers, kingfishers, buzzards, otters, bats and damselflies.|$|E
50|$|The {{economic}} activity was basically of the subsistence level of farming and livestock. Carbonized botanical and animal remains were found which also indicated the subsistence economic activities {{practiced by the}} settlers. The crops grown were cereals and pulses such as naked-six row barley, emmer wheat, lentils, peas, and <b>bitter</b> <b>vetch.</b> Livestock consisted of sheep, goats, cattle, and pigs. Hunting, which was also practiced, included deer, wild boar, tortoises, and birds, {{and there was also}} fishing. Wild nuts such as acorns were also gathered.|$|E
50|$|Legumes {{included}} the lentil, chickpea, black bean, kidney bean, <b>bitter</b> <b>vetch,</b> broad bean, garden pea, and grass pea; Pliny names varieties {{such as the}} Venus pea, and poets praise Egyptian lentils imported from Pelusium. Legumes were planted in rotation with cereals to enrich the soil, and were stockpiled in case of famine. The agricultural writer Columella gives detailed instructions on curing lentils, and Pliny says they had health benefits. Although usually thought of as modest fare, legumes also appear among the dishes at banquets.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bitter</b> <b>vetch</b> (V. ervilia) {{was one of}} {{the first}} domesticated crops. It was grown in the Near East about 9,500 years ago, {{starting}} perhaps even one or two millennia earlier during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A. By the time of the Central European Linear Pottery culture - about 7,000 years ago - broad bean (V. faba) had also been domesticated. Vetch has been found at Neolithic and Eneolithic sites in Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia. And at the same time, at the opposite end of Eurasia, the Hoabinhian people also utilized the broad bean in their path towards agriculture, as shown by the seeds found in Spirit Cave, Thailand.|$|E
