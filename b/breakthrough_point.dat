500|$|The {{successful}} 2009 single [...] "Gee" [...] was a <b>breakthrough</b> <b>point</b> in the group's career. It {{was named}} [...] "Song of the Decade" [...] by Melon and {{regarded as one}} of the first K-Pop songs to gain international attention—students at Yale School of Art and Harvard Law School in the United States highlighted the song as part of their study on Korean culture. The song was also deemed as the factor that increased online search for K-pop from 2009, according to Google's Statistics. The group's foray into the Japanese market was another landmark in their career—their debut Japanese album marked the highest sales of a non-Japanese artist's first album. Ian Martin of The Japan Times noted that the group's popularity was still strong even after the Korean Wave appeal has died down in Japan in 2011–12. The group became the main feature in the K-pop section of Japanese textbooks. During 2009–2011, the group generated ₩68.8 billion ($62 million), raking in $20 million in profits and becoming the highest profit earner for their label SM Entertainment. During the first half of 2014, they raked in ₩30.3 billion ($28 million) in profit. In Japan, the group consistently ranked among K-pop's highest-grossing acts, generating ₩12, ₩71 and ₩55 billion ($11, $65.5 and $48 million) in revenue in 2010, 2011, and 2012 respectively.|$|E

40|$|A {{construction}} of a breakthrough between the Železna and the Babja Cave near Domžale, Slovenia, has been an initiative of the local cavers. At the beginning, the traverse has been measured to determine <b>breakthrough</b> <b>points</b> in both caves. Based on the reference points, obtained from the Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia, a open traverse was measured with an electronic tacheometer Leica TCRP 1201 R 300.

In 1952, Wright dominated the season, winning nineteen votes in the Brownlow medal to tie for first place with Essendon's Bill Hutchison. The prevailing system gave Wright the award, although Hutchison was given a retrospective medal in 1989.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the first}} {{defensive}} unit breaks, the adjacent units suffer adverse {{results from this}} (spreading panic, additional defensive angles, threat to supply lines). Since they were already pressured, this leads them to [...] "snap" [...] as well, causing a domino-style collapse of the defensive system. The defensive force thus evaporates at the <b>breakthrough</b> <b>point,</b> giving the attacker the option to rapidly move troops into the gap, exploiting the breakthrough in width (by attacking enemy units {{at the edge of}} the breakthrough, so widening it), in depth (advancing into enemy territory towards strategic objectives), or a combination of both.|$|E

50|$|Bypassing {{and cutting}} off enemy strongpoints {{often results in}} the {{collapse}} of that strongpoint even where the physical damage is minimal (such as the Maginot Line). Firepower, which is used primarily to destroy as many enemy forces as possible in attrition warfare, is used to suppress or destroy enemy positions at <b>breakthrough</b> <b>points</b> during maneuver warfare. Infiltration tactics by conventional or special forces may be used extensively to cause chaos and confusion behind enemy lines.|$|R
50|$|The first echelon used raw {{firepower}} {{and mass}} {{to break the}} layered enemy defences, but the second echelon operational reserves combined firepower and mobility, something lacking in the former. Operational units were heavily formed from mechanized, motorised and Cavalry forces. These forces would now seek to envelope the enemy tactical forces as yet unengaged along the flanks of the <b>breakthrough</b> <b>point.</b> Other units would press on to occupy the operational zones and meet the enemy operational reserves as they moved through his rear {{to establish a new}} defence's line. While in the operational rear of the enemy, communications and supply depots were prime targets for the Soviet forces. With his tactical zones isolated from reinforcements, reinforcements blocked from relieving them, the front would be indefensible. Such a method would instigate operational paralysis for the defender.|$|E
50|$|Once in England, the {{battalion}} began {{preparing for the}} 6 June invasion of Normandy.

On the 14 of the same month, {{the rest of the}} battalion crossed to France and started work. Moving with the fighting forces across France, the battalion entered German territory at Korneli Munster on the sixteenth of September. After the capture of the Lundendorf Bridge near Remagen, the battalion strung two telephone cables taken from a captured German submarine across the Rhine river, while under attack from small arms fire and aircraft. The cables provided dependable communications between the American forces {{on both sides of the}} river at the <b>breakthrough</b> <b>point.</b> Communications support continued until the German surrender on the 9 May 1945.|$|E

[...] The {{bottom of the shaft}} was dug by Bob Leakey and Gordon Batty in the 1950s, but without breaking through. The challenge was then picked up by members of the Gritstone Club in 1965, who succeeded in digging down a little further to expose a tight crawl which proved to be the <b>breakthrough</b> <b>point</b> into the main cave. Humble Inlet was discovered by members of the Burnley Caving Club in 1981, when they climbed a 22 m high aven in High Stream Chamber.

50|$|As {{one of the}} long-time {{researchers}} on Jurassic coal measure-derived hydrocarbon reservoirs in NW China, Zhao took Turpan-Hami basin as the <b>breakthrough</b> <b>point</b> {{to summarize}} the basic petroleum geological conditions and distributional regularity of oil/gas accumulations. After doing a comprehensive research and assessment on the favorable plays and drilling targets in 1987, he took the responsibility to write the pre-drilling research report to proof the location of drilling the first scientific exploration well (SEW) in onshore China, and he suggested the Shanshan local structural high {{is the best place}} to drill a wildcat in Turpan-Hami basin. In 1989, the well Taican-1 got the commercial oil flow of 25.9 cubic meters per day in the Jurassic interval, which was the first breakthrough, since the exploration activity had long been stopped in 1950s-1960s. Up to date, Turpan-Hami basin has established a medium oil/gas production unit under PetroChina management with the annual production reaching 3 million tons of oil equivalents. Since the discovery of Shanshan oil field, Zhao had been keeping research on the whole Jurassic strata in NW China in particular, and summarized the favorable conditions for coal measure-derived oil/gas accumulations as the followings: ①the Jurassic prototype basin must exist to accumulate abundant and good-quality source kitchen with coal beds and coaly seams dominantly developed where both the oil-prone and gas-prone maceral materials are rich accumulated; ②the successive basin are moderately developed sitting on the Jurassic prototype basin, which is necessary not only to keep the source rock in an appropriate maturation, but also to maintain the reservoir having certain amount of porosity; ③the good association of source rock-reservoir-cap rock are well reserved for late occurrence of oil/gas migration and accumulation and ④certain degree of tectonic compression is needed to push the oil expulsing in quantity from the coal measure source rocks which have strong absorption on the oil and gas. Based on his research, Zhao proposed six favorable regions for doing further exploration in 1995 in NW China, which have been proved by a number of exploration wells and discoveries to be the best regions where traps the major oil/gas accumulations of Jurassic and Jurassic source rock-related in NW China.According to statistics, so far the proved oil and gas reserves discovered in Zhao’s predicted six zones have exceeded 1.5 billion tons of oil equivalents, which has yearly provided more than 15 million tons of oil equivalents. It is also confirmed that there is no oil and gas reserve output outside these 6 zones. Due to his contribution in pushing exploration of Jurassic coal measure-derived oil/gas reservoirs, he won the First Prize of provincial-level Award (CNPC) in 1995, and an award for significant discoveries of Oil & Gas Fields from CNPC in 1997.|$|E
