5|$|At the Emperor's death, the Byzantines {{had control}} {{of most of}} Italy, North Africa, and a small {{foothold}} in southern Spain. Justinian's reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm and {{setting the stage for}} the early Muslim conquests, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> difficulties faced by Justinian's successors were due not just to over-taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire, which made raising troops difficult.|$|E
5|$|Baden was not {{originally}} intended to be surrendered {{under the terms of}} the Armistice, but was substituted for the battlecruiser Mackensen, which lay incomplete and could not put to sea. As a result, instead of joining the High Seas Fleet when it departed for Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918, Baden left Germany on 7 January 1919. The Royal Navy inspected the ship on 9 January, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technical instruments, including gunnery equipment, had been removed before the ship left Germany.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{adults are}} {{characterized}} by their four scale-covered wings, which give the Lepidoptera their name (Ancient Greek λεπίς lepís, scale + πτερόν pterón, wing). These scales give butterfly wings their colour: they are pigmented with melanins that give them blacks and browns, as well as uric acid derivatives and flavones that give them yellows, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blues, greens, reds and iridescent colours are created by structural coloration produced by the micro-structures of the scales and hairs.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of playing fields in the valleys, many rugby teams would share grounds, travel every week to away grounds or even play on {{inappropriate}} (e.g. sloping) pitches. The valley clubs also had no clubhouses, with most teams meeting, and changing, in the closest local public house. Many more clubs, built around colliery and pub teams, appeared and disbanded <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clubs survive to this day.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand reluctantly ordered saps to be {{dug into}} the side of the mountain. The sapping was {{difficult}} and dangerous and the sappers worked under continuous attack from the castle's defenders, who fired on them with small arms and the castle's artillery and dropped rocks and debris on their heads. The forced labor of local peasants minimized losses among Ferdinand's own troops, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peasants perished in the effort.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, after Jackson's sudden death, La Toya Jackson {{said that}} she had {{discovered}} two hard disks at her brother's home which contain more than 1,000 songs that were never released and that are even not registered by any bodies (excluding some).

Perelman's Stability Theorem implies that all <b>but</b> finitely <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M_αs are homeomorphic. The Diffeomorphism Stability Question asks whether all <b>but</b> finitely <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M_αs are diffeomorphic. We {{answer this question}} affirmatively in the special case when all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> singularities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> limit space occur along smoothly and isometrically embedded Riemannian manifolds of codimension ≤ 4. We then describe several applications. For instance, if the limit space is an orbit space whose singular strata are of codimension at ≤ 4, then all <b>but</b> finitely <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M_αs are diffeomorphic...|$|R

The eliminated drivers were determined rather quickly, with the two Renault drivers qualifying 14th and 15th respectively. The two McLarens were next to go out of contention, before Bottas was eliminated for 11th place on the grid, failing to improve on his lap time. Both Force India drivers were the last not to make it into Q3, with Sergio Pérez beating his teammate Hülkenberg to ninth.|$|E

The Phillips building at No.101 is still used for auctions; the company was bought in 2001 by Bonhams, who spent £30million expanding and refurbishing the premises. In 2015, Valentino announced plans to build a new flagship store on Old Bond Street.|$|E
5|$|The Pied-Noir {{relationship}} with France and Algeria {{was marked by}} alienation. The settlers considered themselves French, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pieds-Noirs had a tenuous connection to mainland France, which 28 percent of them had never visited.

5|$|The show {{marked the}} first miniseries on the network, which {{commenced}} its production in March 2014. McHale first envisioned the show in 2004, and pitched it to the network in 2006. After working on The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack and Adventure Time, the network expressed interest in McHale pitching a pilot. That pilot became the catalyst for Over the Garden Wall. Production of the show was largely handled in Burbank, California, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show's storyboard artists worked from other U.S. cities, while the program's animation was outsourced to South Korea. The series' environment evokes 19th- and 20th-century Americana, while its digital backgrounds are designed to resemble grisaille paintings.|$|E
5|$|About {{the same}} time as his gubernatorial {{campaign}} began, Blackburn appeared before the Kentucky General Assembly to advocate measures to protect the state against disease outbreaks, including the creation of a state board of health and the construction of quarantine centers in the state's border towns. To a large degree, his pleas fell upon deaf ears, with the exception of his proposal for the state board of health, which was created in March 1878. Soon after, news came that yellow fever had appeared in the lower Mississippi Valley earlier than usual; by August 1878, it had reached epidemic proportions. Blackburn advocated implementing quarantines to deal with the influx of people fleeing north to escape the disease, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state's doctors did not believe yellow fever could survive as far north as Kentucky. Some towns in the Jackson Purchase region attempted to implement crude quarantines, but the city of Louisville completely ignored Blackburn's advice and welcomed refugees from the South. Blackburn temporarily halted his gubernatorial campaign and traveled to Louisville to help treat those who arrived there already suffering from the disease.|$|E
5|$|By early 1101, Henry's {{new regime}} was {{established}} and functioning, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Norman elite still supported Robert, or {{would be prepared}} to switch sides if Henry's elder brother appeared likely to gain power in England. In February, Flambard escaped from the Tower of London and crossed the Channel to Normandy, where he injected fresh direction and energy to Robert's attempts to mobilise an invasion force. By July, Robert had formed an army and a fleet, ready to move against Henry in England. Raising the stakes in the conflict, Henry seized Flambard's lands and, with the support of Anselm, Flambard was removed from his position as bishop. Henry held court in April and June, where the nobility renewed their oaths of allegiance to him, but their support still appeared partial and shaky.|$|E

5|$|However, as {{transshipment}} costs increased, and unprocessed bulk cargos {{decreased in}} volume, {{the economics of}} road transport resulted in a gradual dwindling of traffic on the MSC Railway system, and hence contraction in the MSC Railway itself. Traffic reduction was added to by: the 1969 closure of the CWS Irlam soap works; post nationalisation British Steel Corporation building their own line to Glazebrook to junction with BR; and severe reductions in traffic of ICI's soda ash trains, British Tar Products and reduced domestic coal consumption. With the remaining engines stationed at Ellesmere Port and Stanlow, maintenance {{on the line from}} Irlam through to Partington was halted in late summer 1977, and all through traffic except engineering trains stopped on 21 December 1977. The through line was officially closed to all traffic in 1978, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sidings complexes remained; the last operational section of the MSC Railway, at Trafford Park, closed on 30 April 2009.|$|E

5|$|Sector General is a {{gigantic}} multi-species hospital space station founded as a peace-promoting project by two heroes from {{opposite sides of}} humanity's first full interstellar war. The hospital accommodates patients and staff from dozens of species, with different environmental requirements, behaviors and ailments, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stories feature types of patient that the builders did not anticipate.
