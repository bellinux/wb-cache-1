25|$|The Philippines {{has been}} the most vocal against Chinese incursions in the dispute, even {{bringing}} its case against China to a United Nations international tribunal in the Hague, the first case filed by a nation against China. Vietnam, Japan, and other Western countries, especially the United States, have strongly supported the Philippines. Vietnam, bordered both by land and sea with China, has also claims all the Spratly Islands. This dispute focuses on the Paracel Islands, which China has occupied following the Battle of the Paracel Islands, in 1974. Brunei, claiming only one reef, has <b>been</b> <b>silent</b> on the issue ever since it began, mostly because of its trade with China. Malaysia, a nation with deep economic ties to China, and a nation with billions in Chinese investment, has remained neutral and 'China-friendly' over the conflict. This despite China claiming various reefs and islands in the Spratlys as well as most of its territorial waters and exclusive economic zones in Borneo.|$|E
25|$|An {{indirect}} {{public health}} problem posed by cigarettes is that of accidental fires, usually linked with consumption of alcohol. Enhanced combustion using nitrates was traditionally used but cigarette manufacturers have <b>been</b> <b>silent</b> on this subject claiming at first that a safe cigarette was technically impossible, then that {{it could only be}} achieved by modifying the paper. Roll your own cigarettes contain no additives and are fire safe. Numerous fire safe cigarette designs have been proposed, some by tobacco companies themselves, which would extinguish a cigarette left unattended for more than a minute or two, thereby reducing the risk of fire. Among American tobacco companies, some have resisted this idea, while others have embraced it. RJ Reynolds was a leader in making prototypes of these cigarettes in 1983 and will make all of their U.S. market cigarettes to be fire-safe by 2010. Phillip Morris is not in active support of it. Lorillard (purchased by RJ Reynolds), the US' 3rd-largest tobacco company, seems to be ambivalent.|$|E

[...] But, she wrote, this does not relieve Polish Catholics of their duty to oppose the crimes being committed in their country.|$|R

25|$|Ludivine Barbier, a France-native {{and wife}} of Rodolfo Cázares, also {{gathered}} around 72,400 signatures through Change.org in late 2012, and asked Mexico's President Enrique Peña Nieto {{to help bring}} her husband back. The petition was also directed to politicians Miguel Ángel Osorio Chong, Luis Videgaray Caso, and Erwin Manuel Lino Zárate. In the petition page, Barbier complained that Mexican authorities have <b>been</b> <b>silent</b> about the case and that the police have ignored them for over a year. She stated that Peña Nieto had to improve his image abroad, and argued that if her petition managed to gather signatures {{from all over the}} world, the President would have no other option but to work on the case. Barbier also joined in solidarity with Frédérique Santal, the sister of Olivier Tschumi, a Swiss native who was kidnapped in Cuernavaca, Morelos in 2010 and remains disappeared. In December 2012, both of them met in Paris with Mexican peace activist Javier Sicilia, who handed over a petition Mexico's ambassador to France. The petition intended to ask Peña Nieto to enact a law protecting victims of violence in Mexico. Barbier also gave the petition letter for Peña Nieto to Juan Andrés Ordóñez Gómez, who managed the administrative duties of the Embassy of Mexico in France and substitute of Carlos de Icaza González.|$|E

500|$|In October 2013 Lamont faced {{criticism}} for her reaction to an industrial dispute at the Grangemouth Oil Refinery. Ineos, {{the company that}} operates the plant, had stated that the refinery was making financial losses, and had proposed a survival plan requiring employees to accept worse employment terms, notably changes in work rules and less generous pensions; this the employees rejected. The company mothballed the plant, threatening to close it if the terms were not accepted. Lamont urged Ineos to withdraw its conditions and for both sides to hold talks, while Salmond tried to negotiate an agreement. Union officials eventually agreed not to call a strike {{for at least three}} years, and the plant reopened. The Ineos chairman, Calum MacLean, described Lamont's support for the trade unions during the dispute as [...] "deeply irresponsible", while Salmond claimed she had <b>been</b> <b>silent</b> throughout the disagreement. Writing for the Dunfermline Press, Natalie McGarry suggested that while the Labour leader's silence probably {{had much to do with}} the continuing Falkirk selection row, ultimately she was [...] "found wanting".|$|E
