25|$|The {{formation}} {{begins as}} tidal flats gain elevation relative to sea level by sediment accretion, and subsequently the rate {{and duration of}} tidal flooding decreases so that vegetation can colonize on the exposed surface. The arrival of propagules of pioneer species such as seeds or rhizome portions are combined {{with the development of}} suitable conditions for their germination and establishment in the process of colonisation. When rivers and streams arrive at the low gradient of the tidal flats, the discharge rate reduces and suspended sediment settles onto the tidal flat surface, helped by the <b>backwater</b> <b>effect</b> of the rising tide. Mats of filamentous blue-green algae can fix silt and clay sized sediment particles to their sticky sheaths on contact which can also increase the erosion resistance of the sediments. This assists the process of sediment accretion to allow colonising species (e.g.,Salicornia spp.) to grow. These species retain sediment washed in from the rising tide around their stems and leaves and form low muddy mounds which eventually coalesce to form depositional terraces, whose upward growth is aided by a sub-surface root network which binds the sediment. Once vegetation is established on depositional terraces further sediment trapping and accretion can allow rapid upward growth of the marsh surface such that there is an associated rapid decrease in the depth and duration of tidal flooding. As a result, competitive species that prefer higher elevations relative to sea level can inhabit the area and often a succession of plant communities develops.|$|E

During monsoon season at East Coast of Malaysia, the amount of water flow in upstream of bridge increases due to long duration and high intensity of rainfall that effectively increases the backwater amount.

40|$|A spur dike is a {{hydraulic}} structure {{built on the}} bank of a river at some angle to the main flow direction. A series of spur dikes in a row may also be placed on one side or both sides of a river to form a spur dike field. Spur dikes are used for two main purposes, namely river training and bank protection. For river training, spur dikes may be used to provide a desirable path for navigation purposes or to direct the flow to a desirable point such as a water intake. For bank protection, spur dikes may be used to deflect flow away from a riverbank and thus protect it from erosion. It has also been observed that spur dikes provide a desirable environment for aquatic habitat. Despite the fact that spur dikes are useful hydraulic structures, they have been found to increase the flow resistance in rivers and hence increase the flow stage. The present study focuses on the quantification of the flow resistance and associated flow stage increase due to a single spur dike and also that of a spur dike field. Increased flow stage is referred to herein as a <b>backwater</b> <b>effect.</b> In the first stage of the study, the flow resistance due to a single spur dike, expressed as a drag force exerted on the flow in an open channel, was studied and quantified. The work was carried out in a rigid bed flume, with the model spur dike being simulated using various sizes of a two-dimensional (2 -D) rectangular plate. Several discharge conditions were studied. The drag force exerted by the spur dike for both submerged and unsubmerged flow conditions was determined directly from measurements made using a specially designed apparatus and also by application of the momentum equation to a control volume that included the spur dike. It was found that the unit drag force (i. e., drag force per unit area of dike) of an unsubmerged spur dike increases more rapidly with an increase in the discharge when compared with that of a submerged spur dike. The results also showed that an increase in the blockage of the open channel cross-section due to the spur dike is the main parameter responsible for an increase in the spur dike drag coefficient, hence the associated flow resistance and <b>backwater</b> <b>effect.</b> Based on these findings, relationships were developed for estimating the <b>backwater</b> <b>effect</b> due to a single spur dike in an open channel. In the second stage of the study, the flow resistance due to a spur dike field expressed as a drag force exerted on the flow was quantified and subsequently related to the <b>backwater</b> <b>effect.</b> The work was carried out in a rigid bed flume, with the model spur dikes simulated using 2 -D, rectangular plates placed along one side of the flume. For various discharges, the drag force of each individual spur dike in the spur dike field was measured directly using a specially-designed apparatus. For these tests, both submerged and unsubmerged conditions were evaluated along with various numbers of spur dikes and various relative spacings between the spur dikes throughout the field. It was concluded that the configuration of a spur dike field {{in terms of the number}} of spur dikes and relative spacing between the spur dikes has a substantial impact on the drag force and hence the flow resistance and <b>backwater</b> <b>effect</b> of a spur dike field. The most upstream spur dike had the highest drag force amongst the spur dikes in the field, and it acted as a shield to decrease the drag force exerted by the downstream spur dikes. From the experiments on the submerged spur dikes, it was observed that the jet flow over the spur dikes has an important effect on the flow structure and hence the flow resistance. In the third stage of the study, the flow field within the vicinity of a single submerged spur dike was modeled using the three-dimensional (3 -D) computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software FLUENT. Application of the software required solution of the 3 -D Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations wherein the Reynolds stresses were resolved using the RNG ê-å turbulence model. One discharge condition was evaluated in a smooth, rectangular channel for two conditions, including uniform flow conditions without the spur dike in place and one with the spur dike in place. The CFD model was evaluated based on some experimental data acquired from the physical model. It was found that the CFD model could satisfactorily predict the flow resistance and water surface profile adjacent to the spur dike, including the resulting <b>backwater</b> <b>effect.</b> Furthermore, the CFD model gave a good prediction of the velocity field except for the area behind the spur dike where the effects of diving jet flow over the spur dike was not properly modeled...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{the massive}} water volume of the Amazon River, the Amazon tributaries have their water backed up by {{hundreds}} of kilometers upstream their mouth. This <b>backwater</b> <b>effect</b> {{is part of the}} complex hydrodynamics of Amazonian surface waters, which in turn drives the variation in concentrations of organic matter and nutrients, and also regulates planktonic communities such as viruses and bacteria. Viruses and bacteria are commonly tightly coupled, and their ecological role in aquatic food webs has been increasingly recognized. Here, we surveyed viral and bacterial abundances in 26 floodplain lakes along the Trombetas River, the largest clear-water tributary of the Amazon River’s north margin. We correlated viral and bacterial abundances with temperature, pH, dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), phosphorus, nitrogen, turbidity, water transparency, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2), phytoplankton abundance and distance from the lake mouth until the confluence of the Trombetas with the Amazon River. We hypothesized that both bacterial and viral abundances would change along a latitudinal gradient, as the <b>backwater</b> <b>effect</b> becomes more intense with increased proximity to the Amazon River; different flood duration and intensity among lakes and waters with contrasting sources would cause spatial variation. Our measurements were performed during the low water period, when floodplain lakes are in their most lake-like conditions. Viral and bacterial abundances, DOC, pCO 2 and water transparency increased as distance to the Amazon River increased. Most viruses were bacteriophages, as viruses were strongly linked to bacteria, but not to phytoplankton. We suggest that bacterial abundances increase in response to DOC quantity and possibly quality, consequently leading to increased viral abundances. Our results highlight that hydrodynamics {{plays a key role in}} the regulation of planktonic viral and bacterial communities in Amazonian floodplain lakes...|$|E

An open channel junction with a main channel above and below plus a branch channel were constructed in the laboratory. All channels were rectangular in shape, but varied in size.

Provision was made for measuring both inflow and outflow hydrographs and also flow depths at selected points in the three channels. A total of 14 experiments were conducted with various combinations of input hydrographs in terms of magnitude and relative timing. Unsteady flow conditions (depth, velocity and discharge) in the three channels were calculated at calculated at 5 -ft. length increments and 1 -sec. time increments, using the method of explicit finite differences applied to the characteristic equations.

Both local scour downstream from weirs and <b>backwater</b> <b>effects</b> upstream from weirs appear to have caused the general flattening and fining of the channel. A direct-step backwater calculation indicates that backwaters extended to the upstream weir at both low and high flows, creating long sections of flat water separated by short, steep drops. Despite <b>backwater</b> <b>effects,</b> a comparison of longitudinal profiles before and six years after weir installation showed bed erosion downstream of nearly all weirs, likely a consequence of the cohesive clay material that dominates the channel bed and banks. A deep inner channel reflects the cohesive nature of the clay and the mechanisms of abrasion, and indicates that sediment load is low relative to the transport capacity of the flow. Unfortunately, weirs were problematic in this system because of the cohesive clay substrate, limited sediment supply, and low channel gradient. Although deeper flows due to backwaters might be more favorable for resident trout, less gravel and fewer riffles are likely to negatively impact trout spawning habitat, macroinvertebrate communities, and biofilm productivity.

In order to obtain the response curves of the water level of the Vipava River at Sovodnje, simulations using a one -dimensional hydraulic model HEC -RAS were performed. The water level of the Vipava River in its lower reach near the confluence is highly influenced by increased discharge of the Soča River at the confluence with the Vipava River, which causes backwater of the Vipava River.

High-flow shear stresses in different reaches were calculated using stage loggers.

In areas influenced by backwater, single-parameter rating curve techniques are often inapplicable. To overcome this, several authors have advocated {{the use of an}} additional downstream level gauge to estimate the longitudinal surface level gradient, but this is cumbersome in a lowland meandering river with considerable transverse surface level gradients. Recent developments allow river flow to be continuously monitored through velocity measurements with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (H-ADCP), deployed horizontally at a river bank. This approach was adopted to obtain continuous discharge estimates at a cross-section in the River Mahakam at a station located about 300 km upstream of the river mouth in the Mahakam delta. The discharge station represents an area influenced by variable <b>backwater</b> <b>effects</b> from lakes, tributaries and floodplain ponds, and by tides. We applied both the standard index velocity method and a recently developed methodology to obtain a continuous time-series of discharge from the H-ADCP data. Measurements with a boat-mounted ADCP were used for calibration and validation of the model to translate H-ADCP velocity to discharge. As a comparison with conventional discharge estimation techniques, a stage-discharge relation using Jones formula was developed. The discharge rate at the station exceeded 3250 m 3 s&minus; 1 . Discharge series from a traditional stage-discharge relation did not capture the overall discharge dynamics, as inferred from H-ADCP data. For a specific river stage, the discharge range could be as high as 2000 m 3 s&minus; 1 , which is far beyond what could be explained from kinematic wave dynamics. <b>Backwater</b> <b>effects</b> from lakes were shown to be significant, whereas interaction of the river flow with tides may impact discharge variation in the fortnightly frequency band.

This approach was adopted to obtain continuous discharge estimates at two cross-sections in the River Mahakam, i. e. at an upstream station located about 300 km {{from the river}} mouth and at a downstream station located about 15 km from the river mouth in the Mahakam delta. We applied both the standard index velocity method and a recently developed methodology to obtain a continuous time-series of discharge from the H-ADCP data. Measurements with a boat-mounted ADCP were used for calibration and validation of the model to translate H-ADCP velocity to discharge. The new method accounts for the dip in velocity near the water surface, which is caused by sidewall effects that decrease with the width to depth ratio of a channel. A boundary layer model is introduced to convert single depth velocity data from the H-ADCP to specific discharge. A regression model is employed to translate specific discharge to total discharge. The upstream discharge station represents an area influenced by variable <b>backwater</b> <b>effects</b> from lakes, tributaries and floodplain ponds, and by tides. Discharge rates at this station exceeded 3250 m 3 s ˆ’ 1. <b>Backwater</b> <b>effects</b> from lakes were shown to be significant, whereas interaction of the river flow with tides systematically impact discharge variation. Despite the complexity of feedbacks between the river flow and the tidal motion, tides are shown to have a predictable modulating effect on discharge, which is most apparent in the fortnightly frequency band. At the downstream station, discharge rates exceeded 8000 m 3 s ˆ’ 1. Intratidal variations were most obvious during bidirectional flow conditions, which occurred only during conditions of low river discharge. The new method was shown to outperform the widely used index velocity method in these poorly gauged sites...|$|R
40|$|Conceptual reservoir-type {{models of}} river systems, that mimic {{the results of}} {{detailed}} hydrodynamic models, provide {{a powerful tool for}} numerous river management applications. Thanks to their computationally efficient model structure they are very well suited for applications that require long term simulations or a large number of model iterations. However, one well-known problem is that conceptual models have difficulties to account for <b>backwater</b> <b>effects.</b> For this reason, their application to tidally influenced river reaches so far was almost non-existent. This paper introduces an extension of an existing grey-box reservoir modelling technique to incorporate tidally influenced river reaches. The methodology is demonstrated for the downstream part of the rivers Zenne and Rupel in Belgium. Results show a minor loss of accuracy when the detailed model is replaced by the surrogate conceptual model. Also, the tidal effects are well represented. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{mean water}} level in {{estuaries}} {{rises in the}} landward direction due {{to a combination of}} the density gradient, the tidal asymmetry, and the <b>backwater</b> <b>effect.</b> This phenomenon is more prominent under an increase of the fresh water discharge, which strongly intensifies both the tidal asymmetry and the <b>backwater</b> <b>effect.</b> However, the interactions between tide and river flow and their individual contributions to the rise of the mean water level along the estuary are not yet completely understood. In this study, we adopt an analytical approach to describe the tidal wave propagation under the influence of substantial fresh water discharge, where the analytical solutions are obtained by solving a set of four implicit equations for the tidal damping, the velocity amplitude, the wave celerity, and the phase lag. The analytical model is used to quantify the contributions made by tide, river, and tide–river interaction to the water level slope along the estuary, which sheds new light on the generation of backwater due to tide–river interaction. Subsequently, the method is applied to the Yangtze estuary under a wide range of river discharge conditions where the influence of both tidal amplitude and fresh water discharge on the longitudinal variation of the mean tidal water level is explored. Analytical model results show that in the tide-dominated region the mean water level is mainly controlled by the tide–river interaction, while it is primarily determined by the river flow in the river-dominated region, which is in agreement with previous studies. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the effect of the tide alone is most important in the transitional zone, where the ratio of velocity amplitude to river flow velocity approaches unity. This {{has to do with the}} fact that the contribution of tidal flow, river flow, and tide–river interaction to the residual water level slope are all proportional to the square of the velocity scale. Finally, we show that, in combination with extreme-value theory (e. g. generalized extremevalue theory), the method may be used to obtain a first-order estimation of the frequency of extreme water levels relevant for water management and flood control. By presenting these analytical relations, we provide direct insight into the interaction between tide and river flow, which will be useful for the study of other estuaries that experience substantial river discharge in a tidal region.

30|$|In 2006 a {{disastrous}} 6.3 -magnitude (Richter scale) earthquake occurred, whose epicenter was located 30  km south-east of Yogyakarta city. The construction site facilities were mostly intact, however, {{the water level}} on-site raised approx. 2  m after the earthquake, wherefore the works’ continuation was impossible. Supported by German professional divers {{it was found that}} the water level increase referred to an earthquake-induced rockfall downstream of the construction site. In total approx. 1000  m 3 of rocks blocked the river bed, which had to be removed applying blasting activities by German and Indonesian specialists. Finally a reduction of the <b>backwater</b> <b>effect</b> was achieved and the construction works were resumed with the implementation of the concrete barrage. Due to the working conditions underground (narrowness, high humidity, high temperature, etc.) the concrete works were very challenging. Thus it was decided to realize the monolithic barrage from base to top in six sections, each implemented in intervals of several days using a total of approx. 220  m 3 of concrete. The concrete works were completed with the finalization of the contact injections between barrage and rock applying specifically developed materials.|$|E
40|$|The fluvio-geomorphological {{processes}} in meander bends are spatially uneven in distribution. Typically, higher velocities and erosion take place near the outer bank beyond the bend apex, while the inner bend point bar grows laterally towards the outer bank, increasing the bend amplitude. These dynamics maintain the meander evolution. Even though this development {{is found in}} meandering rivers independent of soil or environmental characteristics, each river still seems to behave unpredictably. The special mechanisms that determine the rate and occasion of morphological changes remain unclear. The {{aim of this study}} is to offer new insights regarding flow-induced morphological changes in meander using a novel study approach. We focused on short-term and small-spatial-scale changes by conducting a spatially and temporally (daily) intensive survey during a flood (a period of nine days) with an ADCP attached to a remotely controlled mini-boat. Based on our analysis, the flood duration and the rate of discharge increase and decrease seems to play key roles in determining channel changes by controlling the flow velocities and depth and the <b>backwater</b> <b>effect</b> may have notable influence on the morphological processes. We discuss themes such as the interaction of inner and outer bend processes and the longer-term development of meander bends. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Tidal {{rivers and}} lowland {{wetlands}} present a transition region where {{the interests of}} hydrologists and physical oceanographers overlap. Physical oceanographers tend to simplify river hydrology, by often assuming a constant river discharge when studying estuarine dynamics. Hydrologists, in turn, generally ignore the direct or indirect effects of tides in water level and discharge records. This thesis aims to improve methods to monitor, model and predict discharge dynamics in tidal rivers and lowland wetlands, by focussing on the central and lower reaches of the River Mahakam (East Kalimantan, Indonesia), and the surrounding lakes area. The 980 -km long river drains an area of about 77100 km 2 between 2 °N - 1 °S and 113 °E - 118 °E. Due to its very mild bottom slope, a significant tidal influence occurs in this river. The middle reach of the river {{is located in a}} subsiding basin, parts of which are below mean sealevel, featuring peat swamps and about thirty lakes connected to the river via tie channels. Upstream of the lakes area, at about 300 km from the river mouth, an acoustic Doppler current profiler (H-ADCP) has been horizontally deployed at a station near the city of Melak (Chapter 2). The H-ADCP profiles of velocity are converted to discharge adopting a new calibration methodology. The obtained time-series of discharge show the tidal signal is clearly visible during low flow conditions. Besides tidal signatures, the discharge series  show influences by variable <b>backwater</b> <b>effects</b> from the lakes, tributaries and floodplain ponds. The discharge rate at the station exceeds 3250 m 3 s - 1 with a hysteretic behaviour. For a specific river stage, the discharge range can be as high as 2000 m 3 s - 1. Analysis of alternative types of rating curves shows this is far beyond what can be explained from kinematic wave dynamics. Apart from <b>backwater</b> <b>effects,</b> the large variation of discharge for a specified river stage can be explained by river-tide interaction, impacting discharge variation especially in the fortnightly frequency band. A second H-ADCP station has been setup in the lower reach of the Mahakam, near the city of Samarinda, where the tidal discharge amplitude generally exceeds the discharge related to runoff (Chapter 3). Conventional rating curve techniques are inappropriate to model river discharge at this tidally influenced station. As an alternative, an artificial neural network (ANN) model is developed to investigate the degree to which tidal river discharge at Samarinda station can be predicted from an array of level gauge measurements along the tidal river, and from tidal level predictions at sea. The ANN-based model produces a good discharge estimation, as established from a consistent performance during both the training and the validation periods, showing the discharges can be predicted from water levels only, once that a trained model is available. The ANN models perform well in predicting discharges up to two days in advance. Chapter 4 addresses the role of <b>backwater</b> <b>effects</b> and tidal influences on discharge time-series used to calibrate a rainfall-runoff model. The HBV rainfall-runoff model is implemented for the Mahakam sub-catchment upstream of Melak (25700 km 2). In a first approach, the model is calibrated using a discharge series derived from the H-ADCP measurements from Melak station. In a second approach, discharge estimates derived from a rating curve are used to calibrate the model. Adopting the first approach, a comparatively low model efficiency is obtained, which is attributed to the <b>backwater</b> and tidal <b>effects</b> that are not captured in the model. The second approach produces a relatively higher model efficiency, since the rating curve filters the <b>backwater</b> <b>effects</b> out of the discharge series. Seasonal variation of terms in the water balance is not affected by the choice for one of the two calibration strategies, which shows that backwaters do not have a systematic seasonal effect on the river discharge. To allow for investigation of the causes of <b>backwater</b> <b>effects,</b> satellite radar remote sensing is employed to monitor water levels in wetlands (Chapter 5). A series of Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) images is used to observe the dynamics of the Mahakam River floodplain. To analyze radar backscatter behavior for different land cover types, several regions of interest are selected, based on land cover classes. Medium shrub, high shrub, fern/grass, and degraded forest are found to be sensitive to flooding, whereas peat forest, riverine forest and tree plantation backscatter signatures only slightly change with flood inundation. An analysis of the relationship between radar backscatter and water levels is carried out. For lakes and shrub covered peatland, for which the range of water level variation is high, a good water level-backscatter correlation is obtained. In peat forest covered peatland, subject to a small range of water level variation, water level-backscatter correlations are poor, limiting the ability to obtain a floodplain-wide water surface topography from the radar images. Chapter 6 continues to investigate the degree in which satellite radar remote sensing can serve to distinguish between dry areas and wetlands, which is a difficult task in densely vegetated areas such as peat domes. Flood extent and flood occurrence information are successfully extracted from a series of radar images of the middle Mahakam lowland area. A fully inundated region is easily recognized from a dark signature on radar images. Open water flood occurrence is mapped using a threshold value taken from radar backscatter of the permanently inundated areas. Radar backscatter intensity analysis of the vegetated floodplain area reveals consistently higher backscatter values, indicating flood inundation under forest canopy. Those observations are used to establish thresholds for flood occurrence mapping in the vegetated area. An all-encompassing flood occurrence map is obtained by combining the flood occurrence maps for areas with and without vegetation. Chapter 7 synthesizes the findings from the previous chapters. It is concluded that the <b>backwater</b> <b>effects</b> and subtle tidal influences may prevent the option to predict river discharge using rating curves, which can best be interpreted as a stage-runoff relationship. H-ADCPs offer a promising alternative to monitor river discharge. For a tidal river, an ANN model {{can be used as a}} tool for data gap filling in an H-ADCP based discharge series, or even to derive discharge estimates solely from water levels and water level predictions. Discharge can be predicted several time-steps ahead, allowing water managers to take measures based on forecasts. The stage-runoff relationship derived from a continuous series of H-ADCP based discharge estimates may be expected to be much more accurate than a similar rating curve derived from a small number of boat surveys. The flood occurrence map derived from PALSAR images can offer a detailed insight into the hydroperiod, the period in which a soil area is waterlogged, and flood extent of the lowland area, illustrating the added value of radar remote sensing to wetland hydrological studies. In future work, radar-based floodplain observations may serve to calibrate hydrodynamic models simulating the processes of flooding and emptying of the lakes area...|$|R
