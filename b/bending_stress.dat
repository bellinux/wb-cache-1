Taylor, who served as Chief Constructor for the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair in World War I. The result {{of a series of}} towing tests begun in 1910, this bow reduced water resistance by an average of six percent at high speeds, supported the forecastle and reduced <b>bending</b> <b>stress</b> on the hull. A disadvantage was the formation of a heavy layer of water which would creep up along the forward side of the hull at higher speeds, although this could be reduced to some degree by careful design of this area.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of fatigue cracks, developing due to their low-altitude usage, the B.2R strategic bombers were retired and placed in storage {{by the end of}} 1968. The RAF had experienced intense demand on its existing aerial refuelling tanker fleet, and its existing fleet of Victor B.1 tankers that had been converted earlier were due to be retired in the 1970s, so it was decided that the stored Victor B.2Rs would be converted to tankers also. Handley Page prepared a modification scheme that would see the Victors fitted with tip tanks, the structure modified to limit further fatigue cracking in the wings, and ejection seats provided for all six crewmembers. The Ministry of Defence delayed signing the order for conversion of the B2s until after Handley Page went into liquidation. The contract for conversion was instead awarded to Hawker Siddeley, who produced a much simpler conversion than that planned by Handley Page, with the wingspan shortened to reduce wing <b>bending</b> <b>stress</b> and hence extend airframe life.|$|E

25|$|A typical plywood {{panel has}} face veneers {{of a higher}} grade than the core veneers. The {{principal}} function of the core layers {{is to increase the}} separation between the outer layers where the bending stresses are highest, thus increasing the panel's resistance to bending. As a result, thicker panels can span greater distances under the same loads. In bending, the maximum stress occurs in the outermost layers, one in tension, the other in compression. <b>Bending</b> <b>stress</b> decreases from the maximum at the face layers to nearly zero at the central layer. Shear stress, by contrast, is higher {{in the center of the}} panel, and at the outer fibres.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{strength}} of individual CNT shells is extremely high, weak shear interactions between adjacent shells and tubes lead to significant reduction in the effective strength of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotube bundles down to only a few GPa. This limitation has been recently addressed by applying high-energy electron irradiation, which crosslinks inner shells and tubes, and effectively increases {{the strength}} of these materials to ≈60 GPa for multi-walled carbon nanotubes and ≈17 GPa for double-walled carbon nanotube bundles. CNTs {{are not nearly as}} strong under compression. Because of their hollow structure and high aspect ratio, they tend to undergo buckling when placed under compressive, torsional, or <b>bending</b> <b>stress.</b>|$|E

Because the demand for extreme speed necessitated a long hull with maximum freeboard, the forecastle was extended down 75 {{percent of the total}} length of the hull. For this class, Rear Admiral David W. Taylor, who served as Chief Constructor for the Bureau of Construction and Repair, used a relatively new kind of bow called the bulbous bow or Taylor bow. The result of a series of towing tests begun in 1910, this bow reduced water resistance by an average of six percent, supported the forecastle and reduced <b>bending</b> <b>stress</b> on the hull. At speeds of more than 25 knots, test results were highly favorable. A disadvantage was the formation of a heavy layer of water which would creep up along the outer plating of the forecastle at higher speeds. However, this tendency could be reduced to some degree by careful design of the frames. Taylor first introduced this bow, also known as a bulbous forefoot, in his design of , which entered service in 1910.|$|E

50|$|For drilled bar-stock thermowells, {{the most}} common form of failure is bending fatigue at its base where the <b>bending</b> <b>stresses</b> are greatest. In extreme flow {{conditions}} (high-velocity liquids or high-velocity, high-pressure gases and vapors) catastrophic failure may occur with <b>bending</b> <b>stresses</b> exceeding the ultimate strength of the material. For extremely long thermowells, the static component of the <b>bending</b> <b>stresses</b> may govern design. In less demanding services, fatigue failure is more gradual and often preceded by a series sensor failures. The latter are due to the acceleration of the thermowell tip as it vibrates, this motion causes the element to lift off the bottom of the thermowell and batter itself to pieces. In cases where the acceleration stresses have been measured, sensor accelerations at resonant conditions often exceed 250 Gs and have destroyed the accelerometer.|$|R
2500|$|Normal stress {{occurs in}} many other {{situations}} besides axial tension and compression. [...] If an elastic bar with uniform and symmetric cross-section is bent {{in one of its}} planes of symmetry, the resulting <b>bending</b> <b>stress</b> will still be normal (perpendicular to the cross-section), but will vary over the cross section: the outer part will be under tensile stress, while the inner part will be compressed. Another variant of normal stress is the hoop stress that occurs on the walls of a cylindrical pipe [...] or vessel filled with pressurized fluid.|$|E
2500|$|The {{analysis}} of stress can be considerably simplified also for thin bars, beams or wires of uniform (or smoothly varying) composition and cross-section that {{are subjected to}} moderate bending and twisting. [...] For those bodies, one may consider only cross-sections that are perpendicular to the bar's axis, and redefine a [...] "particle" [...] as being a piece of wire with infinitesimal length between two such cross sections. [...] The ordinary stress is then reduced to a scalar (tension or compression of the bar), but one {{must take into account}} also a <b>bending</b> <b>stress</b> (that tries to change the bar's curvature, in some direction perpendicular to the axis) and a torsional stress (that tries to twist or un-twist it about its axis).|$|E
2500|$|In that view, one redefines a [...] "particle" [...] {{as being}} an infinitesimal patch of the plate's surface, so that the {{boundary}} between adjacent particles becomes an infinitesimal line element; both are implicitly extended in the third dimension, normal to (straight through) the plate. [...] "Stress" [...] is then redefined as being {{a measure of the}} internal forces between two adjacent [...] "particles" [...] across their common line element, divided by the length of that line. [...] Some components of the stress tensor can be ignored, but since particles are not infinitesimal in the third dimension one can no longer ignore the torque that a particle applies on its neighbors. [...] That torque is modeled as a <b>bending</b> <b>stress</b> that tends to change the curvature of the plate. [...] However, these simplifications may not hold at welds, at sharp bends and creases (where the radius of curvature is comparable to the thickness of the plate).|$|E

2500|$|There are {{a number}} of columns {{supporting}} the structure. As the ground level rises from the shore {{to the level of the}} Yerba Buena Tunnel, the height of the above ground portion of the columns varies. Since the rock structure supporting these is a hard shale, it would be normal under previous engineering methods to simply dig a relatively shallow foundation for each column, with the structural length varying progressively. Modern seismic analysis and computer simulations revealed the problem with such a design; while the long columns could flex several feet at the top (0.6 meter, more or less), the shorter columns were likely to break, since the rigid deck structures cause the imposition of a similar amount of motion at the tops of the columns, imposing more <b>bending</b> <b>stress</b> per unit length on the shorter columns. This problem was solved by making the columns of similar (but not uniform) length, with the [...] "shorter" [...] columns extending in permanent open shafts to deep foundations. This allows all columns of the YBITS to respond in a sufficiently uniform manner. The space between a column and its pit is covered by a protective sacrificial cover, forming a type of base isolation system at the more sensitive column locations. In addition, the western landing of the YBITS is a zero moment hinge, and so there are no vertical bending stresses at that point.|$|E

The materials used in the tests were 0. 040 -in. - thick 2024 -T 3 alclad and 0. 090 -in. -thick 2024 -T 3 bare sheet. In the tests, the membrane stresses were applied as a constant amplitude loading at a stress ratio (minimum to maximum stress) of 0. 02, and the <b>bending</b> <b>stresses</b> were applied as a constant amplitude deflection in phase with the membrane stresses. Tests were conducted at ratios of <b>bending</b> to membrane <b>stresses</b> (B/M) of 0, 0. 75, and 1. 50.

40|$|Realistic {{predictions}} of service life of steel catenary risers (SCR) require an accurate characterization of seafloor stiffness {{in the region}} where the riser contacts the seafloor, the so-called touchdown zone. This thesis presents the initial stage of development of a simplified seafloor support model. This model simulates the seafloor-pipe interaction as a flexible pipe supported {{on a bed of}} springs. Constants for the soil springs were derived from finite element studies performed in a separate, parallel investigation. These supports are comprised of elasto-plastic springs with spring constants being a function of soil stiffness and strength, and the geometry of the trench within the touchdown zone. Deflections and <b>bending</b> <b>stresses</b> in the pipe are computed based on a finite element method and a finite difference formulation developed in this research project. The finite difference algorithm has capabilities for analyzing linear springs, non-linear springs, and springs having a tension cut-off. The latter feature simulates the effect of a pipe pulling out of contact with the soil. The model is used to perform parametric studies to assess the effects of soil stiffness, soil strength, trench geometry, amplitude of pipe displacements, pipe stiffness, and length of touchdown zone on pipe deflections and <b>bending</b> <b>stresses.</b> In conclusions, the seafloor stiffness (as characterized by the three spring parameters), the magnitude of pipe displacement, and the length of the touchdown zone all influence <b>bending</b> <b>stresses</b> in the pipe. Also, the tension cutoff effect, i. e., the pipe pulling away from the soil, can have a very large effect on <b>bending</b> <b>stresses</b> in the pipe. Neglecting this effect can lead to serious over-estimate of stress levels and excessive conservatism in design...|$|R
