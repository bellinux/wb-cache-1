5|$|Topoisomerases {{introduce}} both single- and double-strand <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{course of}} changing the DNA's state of supercoiling, which is especially common in regions near an open replication fork. Such breaks are not considered DNA damage because they are a natural intermediate in the topoisomerase biochemical mechanism and are immediately repaired by the enzymes that created them.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{infection}} causes chronic ongoing {{inflammation and}} production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, the HIV genome may be vulnerable to oxidative damages, including <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> single-stranded RNA. For HIV, {{as well as for}} viruses generally, successful infection depends on overcoming host defensive strategies that often include production of genome-damaging reactive oxygen. Thus, Michod et al. suggested that recombination by viruses is an adaptation for repair of genome damages, and that recombinational variation is a byproduct that may provide a separate benefit.|$|E
5|$|Musker and Clements {{created the}} Genie with Robin Williams in mind; even though Katzenberg {{suggested}} actors such as John Candy, Steve Martin, and Eddie Murphy, Williams was approached and eventually accepted the role. Williams came for voice recording sessions during <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shooting {{of two other}} films he was starring in at the time, Hook and Toys. Unusually for an animated film, much of Williams' dialogue was ad-libbed: for some scenes, Williams was given topics and dialogue suggestions, but allowed to improvise his lines. It was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters. Eric Goldberg, the supervising animator for the Genie, then reviewed Williams' recorded dialogue and selected the best gags and lines that his crew would create character animation to match.|$|E

5|$|Robert DeLeo, against Atlantic Records' wishes, {{insisted that}} he and his brother Dean DeLeo produce the record themselves, which began {{production}} in early 2009. Because recording took place during <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> band's touring schedule, production took nearly ten months to complete. Three studios were used simultaneously, including Robert's home studio and Eric Kretz's Bomb Shelter Studios. Scott Weiland recorded vocals at his own Lavish Studios. Don Was was brought in as an additional producer to help keep the band's separate recording sessions in sync, as well as to work closely with Weiland during the recording of his vocals. The album was completed in December 2009, and mixing and mastering were finished by February 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Bryan {{brothers}} faced Fisher and Huss in {{the first}} semifinal and lost, ending their streak of winning 13 consecutive matches. Mirnyi and Ram encountered much harder competition against Knowle and Melzer and saved five match points before winning. In the final, there were no service <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first set, with Fisher and Huss winning it in the tiebreak. Mirnyi and Ram came back strong to win the second set. The match-tiebreak decided {{the outcome of the}} final, with Mirnyi and Ram winning the tiebreak and the match. It was Mirnyi's 36th and Ram's 16th men's doubles title of the career and their second title as a team.|$|E
5|$|The {{holes in}} the cuticle which allow for this {{digestive}} mechanism pose a challenge for the plant, since they serve as <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cuticle (waxy layer) that protects the plant from desiccation. As a result, P. moranensis is usually found in relatively humid environments. The production of the stalked capture glands and sessile digestive glands is also costly. A {{recent study found that}} the density of these respective glands can be correlated to environmental gradients. For example, capture gland density was found to be highest where prey availability was low, whereas digestive glands density showed direct correlation to prey availability. These results suggest that the amount of investment in carnivorous features is an adaptation to the environmental gradients.|$|E

5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is also home}} to several bogs, which exist as <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cloud forests. It is believed that bogs form in low-lying areas where clay in the soil prevents proper water drainage, resulting in an accumulation of water that impedes the root systems of woody plants. Kohala's bogs are characterized by sedges, mosses of the genus Sphagnum, and oha wai, native members of the bellflower family. Other habitats include rain forest and mesophytic (wet) forests.|$|E
5|$|A lull {{probably}} occurred {{early in}} the afternoon, and a break for rest and food {{would probably have been}} needed. William may have also needed time to implement a new strategy, which may have been inspired by the English pursuit and subsequent rout by the Normans. If the Normans could send their cavalry against the shield wall and then draw the English into more pursuits, <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English line might form. William of Poitiers says the tactic was used twice. Although arguments have been made that the chroniclers' accounts of this tactic were meant to excuse the flight of the Norman troops from battle, this is unlikely as the earlier flight was not glossed over. It was a tactic used by other Norman armies during the period. Some historians have argued that the story of the use of feigned flight as a deliberate tactic was invented after the battle; most historians agree that it was used by the Normans at Hastings.|$|E
5|$|Bonhoeffer et al. {{suggested}} that template switching by the reverse transcriptase {{acts as a}} repair process to deal with <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ssRNA genome. In addition, Hu and Temin {{suggested that}} recombination is an adaptation for repair of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice recombination) by reverse transcriptase could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged ssRNA genome copies. This view of the adaptive benefit of recombination in HIV could explain why each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, the view that recombination is a repair process implies that the benefit of repair can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized {{whether or not the}} two genomes differ genetically. On the view that that recombination in HIV is a repair process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.|$|E

5|$|Exposure occurs through inhalation, {{ingestion}} or occasionally skin contact. Lead may {{be taken}} in through direct contact with mouth, nose, and eyes (mucous membranes), and through <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skin. Tetraethyllead, which was a gasoline additive and is still used in fuels such as aviation fuel, passes through the skin; however inorganic lead found in paint, food, and most lead-containing consumer products is only minimally absorbed through the skin. The main sources of absorption of inorganic lead are from ingestion and inhalation. In adults, about 35–40% of inhaled lead dust is deposited in the lungs, and about 95% of {{that goes into the}} bloodstream. Of ingested inorganic lead, about 15% is absorbed, but this percentage is higher in children, pregnant women, and people with deficiencies of calcium, zinc, or iron. Infants may absorb about 50% of ingested lead, but little is known about absorption rates in children.|$|E
5|$|O'Sullivan {{returned}} to {{action at the}} Masters, to a mixed response from the audience (being both booed and clapped). He won his first round match 6–1 on 16 January 2007, against Ali Carter, making two century <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. However, he then created more controversy by failing to attend a post-match press conference. He did record a short interview with Steve Davis for the BBC, stating that he was much happier than at the UK Championship, {{and that he was}} playing well once again. Sir Rodney Walker later issued a statement declaring that O'Sullivan had been excused from dealing with the media because of the exceptional circumstances affecting him. This decision was criticised by Shaun Murphy. O'Sullivan {{went on to win the}} tournament against Ding Junhui, on 21 January 2007. In the match, he was noted for his good sportsmanship by Steve Davis, specifically for comforting Ding after the twelfth frame, during which Ding had become visibly upset by an overly partisan member of the crowd, who was later ejected. O'Sullivan was leading 9–3 at the time, and won the next frame for a 10–3 victory.|$|E
