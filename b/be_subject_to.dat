5|$|A concern {{from people}} living along the tunnel {{was that they}} would <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> low-frequency noise. Originally the {{municipalities}} of Asker and Bærum had demanded that residents <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> a maximum of 27 decibel A-weighting (dBA), but the National Rail Administration appealed the requirements and was permitted to allow up to 32 dBA. In March 2004, a test {{was done in the}} tunnel to insure that the requirements would be met, as low-frequency sound is difficult to predict. Measurements after the opening of the tunnel showed background noise of 30 dBA, that no-one was subject to 32 dBA or higher, and that it was nearly impossible to measure the passing of trains.|$|E

In 2008, for example, a computer simulation was used to predict that a reorganization of the mantle convection will occur over the next 100 million years, causing a supercontinent composed of Africa, Eurasia, Australia, Antarctica and South America to form around Antarctica.|$|E

Chesney was appointed a papal judge-delegate at least once, and it was in his court that the case of Philip de Broy, a canon in Bedfordshire accused of murdering a knight, was heard. The case was one of those that contributed to King Henry's determination that criminous clerks should <b>be</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> royal justice, not just ecclesiastical justice.|$|E

Underground tests measuring more than 4.75 on the Richter scale would also be barred, subject to revision as research on detection continued.
