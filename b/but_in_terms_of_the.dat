As discussed above, Aristotle had attempted to make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, imagination and the sense perception which both use the sensible koina, and which animals also have; and, on the other hand, nous (intellect) and reason, which perceives another type of koina, the intelligible forms, which (according to Aristotle) only humans have. In other words, these Romans allowed that people could have animal-like shared understandings of reality, not {{just in terms of}} memories of sense perceptions, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way they would tend to explain things, and in the language they use.|$|E

Then she sings, [...] "I wanna love you/ But something's pulling me away from you/ Jesus is my virtue, Judas is the demon I cling to, I cling to." [...] In this section, Gaga's vocals drew comparison to that of Rihanna's by Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone. He also added that her voice sounded less dark and dramatic and was full of [...] "bubbly sweetness". Popjustice wrote that the breakdown sounded like tribal-techno, and the whole song was [...] "a turbo-charged electrogothic wrongness anthem". Dan Martin from NME wrote that the breakdown was in the dubstep genre with the chorus being [...] "pure-pop". There were some similarities and influences of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] in the song, which Gaga said was deliberate. She explained that while sometimes it is important for her to push herself in new directions, she did want her characteristic sound to be imbibed in her records. [...] "I wanted [...] to be an evolution from where I’ve been before <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formula I wanted there to be something about 'Judas' that reminded people of what I’ve done in the past," [...] she added. According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the time signature of common time, and is composed in the key of C minor with a tempo of 131 beats per minute. Gaga's voice ranges from the tonal nodes of B3 to E5 and the song follows a basic sequence of A–Fm7–Cm–B–Cm as its chord progression.|$|E
500|$|Although Smith {{has never}} {{been one of the}} most commercially {{successful}} or career-driven artists, she is one of country music's most celebrated and respected. Music critics, fans, and counterparts alike have considered Smith to be one of the best and most underrated female vocalists in country music history. Music critics have often compared Smith's vocals to that of country legend Patsy Cline, due to her emotional delivery and her strong use of diction and phrasing. In his review of Smith's 1996 compilation The Essential Connie Smith, Jurek explained why Smith's vocals are usually compared to Cline's, [...] "Connie Smith is perhaps the only female singer in the history of country music who can truly claim to be the heiress to Patsy Cline's throne. It's not that there aren't many amazing vocalists in the field, and plenty of legends among them. <b>But</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pure gift of interpretation of taking virtually any song and making it a country song of class and distinction, Smith is it." [...] Many artists in the country music industry have cited Smith as a significant musical influence or one of their favorite musical artists. Chely Wright said that she spent most of her childhood listening to records by Smith. George Jones cited Smith as his favorite female singer in his 1995 autobiography. Elvis Presley had many of Smith's albums in his record collection at his Graceland home and intended on recording Smith's version of [...] "The Wonders You Perform", but never got around to doing so. In a discussion with country songwriter Fred Foster, Dolly Parton famously said, [...] "You know, there's really only three female singers in the world: Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, and Connie Smith. The rest of us are only pretending".|$|E

2500|$|Falk's 1993 book Schrift im Alten Indien is {{considered}} a definitive study on writing in ancient India. Falk's section {{on the origins of}} the Brahmi script features an extensive review of the literature up to that time. Falk also puts forth his own ideas. As have a number of other authors, Falk sees the basic writing system of Brahmi as being derived from the Kharoṣṭhī script, itself a derivative of Aramaic. At the time of his writing, the Ashoka edicts were the oldest confidently dateable examples of Brahmi, and he perceives in them [...] "a clear development in language from a faulty linguistic style to a well honed one" [...] over time, which he takes to indicate that the script had been recently developed. Falk deviates from the mainstream of opinion in seeing Greek as also being a significant source for Brahmi. On this point particularly, Salomon disagrees with Falk, and after presenting evidence of very different methodology between Greek and Brahmi notation of vowel quantity, he states [...] "it is doubtful whether Brahmi derived even the basic concept from a Greek prototype". Further, adds Salomon, in a [...] "limited sense Brahmi can be said to be derived from Kharosthi, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual forms of the characters, {{the differences between the two}} Indian scripts are much greater than the similarities".|$|E
