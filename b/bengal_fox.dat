Some members of the dog family {{such as the}} Indian wolf, <b>Bengal</b> <b>fox,</b> golden jackal and the dhole or wild dogs are also widely distributed. It {{is also home to}} the striped hyaena. Many smaller animals such as macaques, langurs and mongoose species are especially well known due to their ability to live close to or inside urban areas.|$|E
25|$|The Chital {{deer are}} widely seen in southwestern woodlands. Other animals include the black giant squirrel, capped langur, <b>Bengal</b> <b>fox,</b> sambar deer, jungle cat, king cobra, wild boar, mongooses, pangolins, pythons and water monitors. Bangladesh {{has one of}} the largest {{population}} of Irrawaddy dolphins and Ganges dolphins. A 2009 census found 6,000 Irrawaddy dolphins inhabiting the littoral rivers of Bangladesh.

50|$|<b>Bengal</b> <b>foxes</b> are {{endemic to}} India and live {{throughout}} the subcontinent, {{and have not}} {{been placed on the}} endangered species list, but have become threatened by lack of native habitat due to human expansion.|$|R
5|$|The red fox is {{considered}} a more specialised form of Vulpes than the Afghan, corsac and <b>Bengal</b> <b>foxes</b> {{in the direction of}} size and adaptation to carnivory; the skull displays much fewer neotenous traits than in other species, and its facial area is more developed. It is, however, not as adapted for a purely carnivorous diet as the Tibetan fox.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bengal</b> <b>foxes</b> {{are mainly}} crepuscular in their habits. During {{the heat of}} the day, they hide under {{vegetation}} or in subterranean dens that they dig. The dens are large and complex with multiple chambers and escape routes. They are sometimes seen basking at a vantage point around sunrise or sunset. In captivity, the lifespan is about 6 to 8 years.|$|R
500|$|In India, {{the golden}} jackal {{will take over}} the dens of the <b>Bengal</b> <b>fox</b> and the Indian crested porcupine, and will use {{abandoned}} gray wolf dens. Most breeding pairs are spaced well apart and maintain a core territory around their dens. Den excavations commence from late April to May in India, with dens located in scrub areas. Rivulets, gullies, and road and check-dam embankments are prime denning habitats. Drainage pipes and culverts {{have been used as}} dens. Dens are [...] long and [...] deep, with between 1–3 openings. Young pups can be moved between 2–4 dens. The male helps with digging the den and raising the pups. In the Caucasus and Transcaucasia, the burrow is located either in thick shrub, on the slopes of gullies, or on flat surfaces. In Dagestan and Azerbaijan, litters are sometimes located within the hollows of fallen trees, among tree roots, and under stones on river banks. In Central Asia, the golden jackal does not dig burrows but constructs lairs in dense tugai thickets. Jackals in the tugais and cultivated lands of Tajikistan construct lairs in long grass, shrubs, and reed openings.|$|E
