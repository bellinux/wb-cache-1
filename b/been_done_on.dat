5|$|Little {{research}} has <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> this species, {{and not much}} is known about its ecology. The purple-throated cotinga is primarily frugivorous, although it does occasionally eat small insects. A solitary male attracts a female by perching in the canopy and letting the sunlight reflect off its iridescent feathers. It is suspected to breed year-round and is non-migratory. Despite being considered naturally uncommon or rare across its vast range, the purple-throated cotinga is listed as a species of Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, {{planning}} {{continued for}} the construction of the route, as well as modifications to the existing roadway. The City of La Mesa began discussions regarding adding SR 125 from SR 94 to I-8 into the scenic highway system in 1968; the county Planning Commission continued pursuing these plans in 1970. SR 125 was lengthened by the Legislature to extend to the Mexican border in 1972. In 1973, then-governor Ronald Reagan vetoed a bill to delete part of SR 125 from state plans, over concerns that not enough transportation studies had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the matter. An improved interchange with SR94 was being planned the next year. Soon after, Caltrans raised concerns about the remainder of SR 125 not being constructed, due to objections from the community relating to freeway construction in general.|$|E
5|$|On-farm {{factories}} in the Deloraine area made cheese, mostly cheddar, during the early 20th century. Cheese {{was made in the}} Meander area from at least 1908 when a factory opened on the Cheshunt estate. The last of the area's factories closed prior to World War II. Meander had a resident blacksmith from c.1876, though blacksmithing had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> private properties before this. Blacksmithing as a separate industry continued into the early 20th century. Prompted by new legislation in the 1980s, that enforced hygiene standards in animal slaughtering, a slaughter-house was opened in Meander. It was registered in 1986. Before this butchering was a more informal or back-yard industry.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, the Glover's pika {{is rated}} {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species.

The current state of its population trend is unclear, as no natural historic or ecological investigation has <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> this species. However, being locally poisoned and trapped is a major threat to the Glover's pika populations. It is also regionally red listed as a species of least concern in China.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} Cereal Crops Research Institute Pirsabak Nowshera during 2002 - 03 on six wheat cultivars/advance lines to identify the best suitable time of planting in the central agro-ecological zone of NWFP. Randomized complete block design was used with 3 replications. Six planting dates were used from October 25 th to December 15 th with 10 days increment. Data were recorded on Days to 50 % heading, Days to maturity, Plant height and Grain yield. Maximum number of days (132) to 50 % heading were recorded when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> October 25 th Minimum number of days (114) were reported when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> December, 15 th. Maximum number of days (178) to maturity were recorded when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> October 25 th. Number of days to maturity decreased as planting was delayed with 10 days increment. Minimum number of days (130) were recorded when planting was delayed till 15 th of December. Highest plant height (98 cm) was recorded when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> October 25 th and November 05 th. Plant Height decreased as planting was delayed. Minimum Plant height (85 cm) was recorded when planting was delayed till 15 th of December. Maximum grain yield (3937 kg ha - 1) was recorded when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> November 05 th. Grain yield decreased as planting was delayed with 10 days increment. Minimum grain yield (2274 kg ha - 1) was observed when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> 15 th of December. A negative correlation was recorded between planting dates and days to 50 % heading, days to maturity, Plant height and Grain yield. The yield losses due to late planting recorded were 8 % when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> November 15 th, 22 % loss when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> 25 th November, 34 % losses were incurred when planting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> December 5 th and 42 % losses were recorded when planting was further delayed till December 15 th. Hence it is concluded that {{first two weeks of}} November is the best time for obtaining higher yields from the recommended cultivars...|$|R
5|$|The {{plans were}} varied {{again in the}} {{following}} years, but the design of Lake Burley Griffin remained based largely on the original committee's plan. It was later gazetted and legally protected by the federal parliament in 1926, based on a 1918 plan. However, Griffin had a strained working relationship with the Australian authorities {{and a lack of}} federal government funding meant that by the time he left in 1920, little significant work had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the city. A 1920s proposal to reduce West Lake into a ribbon of water was {{made on the basis of}} flood safety. However, the Owen and Peake report of 1929 ruled that the original design was hydrologically sound.|$|E
5|$|Fuseli created {{two other}} works {{depicting}} the Three Witches for a Dublin art gallery in 1794. The first, entitled Macbeth, Banquo and the Three Witches was a frustration for him. His earlier paintings of Shakespearean scenes had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> horizontal canvases, giving the viewer {{a picture of}} the scene that was similar to what would have been seen on stage. Woodmason requested vertical paintings, shrinking the space Fuseli had to work with. In this particular painting he uses lightning and other dramatic effects to separated Macbeth and Banquo from the witches more clearly and communicate how unnatural their meeting is. Macbeth and Banquo are both visibly terrified, while the witches are confidently perched atop a mound. Silhouettes of the victorious army of Macbeth can be seen celebrating in the background, but lack of space necessitates the removal of the barren, open landscape seen in Fuseli's earlier paintings for the Boydell Shakespeare Gallery of the same scene.|$|E
5|$|H. pylori is a {{major cause}} of certain {{diseases}} of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Rising antibiotic resistance increases the need to search for new therapeutic strategies; this might include prevention in the form of vaccination. Much work has <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> developing viable vaccines aimed at providing an alternative strategy to control H. pylori infection and related diseases, including stomach cancer. Researchers are studying different adjuvants, antigens, and routes of immunization to ascertain the most appropriate system of immune protection; however, most of the research only recently moved from animal to human trials. An economic evaluation of the use of a potential H. pylori vaccine in babies found its introduction could, at least in the Netherlands, prove cost-effective for the prevention of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. A similar approach has also been studied for the United States.|$|E

5|$|Historical {{observations}} of the carnivorous syndrome in plant species have been restricted to the more obvious examples of carnivory, such as the active trapping mechanisms of Drosera and Dionaea, though authors have often noted speculation about other species {{that may not be}} so obviously carnivorous. In one of the earlier publications on carnivorous plants, Charles Darwin had suggested many plants that have developed adhesive glands, such as Erica tetralix, Mirabilis longifolia, Pelargonium zonale, Primula sinesis, and Saxifraga umbrosa, may indeed be carnivorous but little research has <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> them. Darwin himself only mentioned these species in passing and did not follow through with any investigation. Adding to the small but growing list, Francis Lloyd provided his own list of species suspected of carnivory in his 1942 book on carnivorous plants, though these species and their potential were only mentioned in the introduction. Later, in a 1981 review of the literature, Paul Simons rediscovered Italian journal articles from the early 1900s that identified several additional sticky species that digested insect prey. Simons was surprised to find these articles lacking in the literature cited sections of many modern books and articles on carnivorous plants, suggesting that academic research has treated Lloyd's 1942 book as the authoritative and comprehensive source on pre-1942 research on the carnivorous syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Malmö Stad, {{the city}} council, {{announced}} on 25 April 2005 {{its intention to}} either help the club renovate Malmö Stadion, or build a new stadium in the same area. Four days later, five different scenarios were laid out by the municipality: the first proposed {{the construction of an}} entirely new, football-specific stadium to the south of Malmö Stadion, while the second suggested the demolition of Malmö Stadion, and the erection of a new ground for football and athletics on the same site. The third, fourth, and fifth ideas all proposed the building of two stadiums, one for football and one for athletics, on various local plots. The municipality chose the first option on 3 December 2005: the new football ground would be built south of Malmö Stadion, with a capacity of 20,000 to 25,000, on a 399million kronor budget. Malmö Stadion, meanwhile, would be renovated into an athletics stadium for 50million kronor. Swedbank Stadion was completed in 2009. As of 2012, no renovation has <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> Malmö Stadion.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June, Quale {{stated that}} the inspectorate should never have {{approved}} the trains. He {{stated that the}} Sørland Line was extreme in Europe {{in the number of}} curves, and that this gave increased stress on the axles. The tests which were used to approve the trains had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the Dovre Line and with a Class 71 set equipped with tilting technology, a class which weighs less than Class 73. He further stated that NSB had controlled only part of the axle and that if proper tests had been made, the fatigue would have been discovered. NSB stated that they had tested the trains on a section of the Dovre Line they considered to be more curvy than the most curvy parts of the Sørland Line. There was also a misunderstanding in the approval, as NSB had said to DNV that the tests on the Dovre Line were not to be considered representative for the Sørland Line, while the inspectorate had the impression that DNV had approved the tests also for the Sørland Line. NSB stated that all tests would be done again before the trains were put back into service.|$|E
