He used the ancient Greek term pepeiramenoi to mean observations, or at most investigative procedures, such as (in Generation of Animals) finding a fertilised hen's egg of a suitable stage and opening it so as to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the embryo's heart inside.|$|E

5|$|Beetle {{antennae}} {{are primarily}} organs of sensory perception and can detect motion, odour and chemical substances, {{but may also}} be used to physically feel a beetle's environment. Beetle families may use antennae in different ways. For example, when moving quickly, tiger beetles may not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> very well and instead hold their antennae rigidly in front of them in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E

5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth {{who is able to}} control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> themselves as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{the optic}} nerve (II) affects {{specific}} aspects of vision that depend on {{the location of the}} lesion. A person may not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the optic chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by examining the visual field, or by examining the retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in the optic nerve, or further along the visual pathways.|$|E

5|$|In some stories, kitsune have {{difficulty}} hiding their tails {{when they take}} human form; looking for the tail, perhaps when the fox gets drunk or careless, is a common method of discerning the creature's true nature. A particularly devout individual may in some cases even <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> through a fox's disguise merely by perceiving them. Kitsune may also be exposed while in human form by their fear and hatred of dogs, and some become so rattled by their presence that they revert to {{the form of a}} fox and flee.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{range of}} any radar system {{is due to}} its pulse width, {{the length of time}} that the {{transmitter}} is turned on before it turns off so the receiver can listen for reflections from targets. If the echo from the target is received while the transmitter is still sending, the echo will be swamped by the transmitted pulse backscattering off local sources. For instance, a radar with a pulse width of 1µs would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> returns from a target less than 150m away, because the radar signal travelling {{at the speed of light}} would cover the round trip distance of 300m before that 1µs interval had passed.|$|E
5|$|Written by Joseph Lidster. A story idea {{considered}} for {{the third and fourth}} episodes of the fourth series. It was based upon the notion of 'faces' which people used to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in patterned wallpaper. While redecorating, one of the Bannerman Road gang was to strip some paint off a wall and reveal old wallpaper underneath. Faces would appear on the wallpaper; these would be aliens from another dimension trying to arrive on Earth, literally taking shape in walls and stepping through. It was noted that this notion could be adapted for patterns in wooden floors and doors.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Alfonso Cuarón had a {{predilection for}} space {{programs}} {{and dreamed of}} becoming an astronaut and would watch live moon landings in television. He was 8 years old when Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969 and was profoundly influenced by Neil Armstrong. At that time his grandmother bought a new color TV in order to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the moon landing that was in black and white. He watched space films like A Trip to the Moon (1902) and was further drawn to films featuring the technology of space exploration, and trying to honor {{the laws of physics}} such as Marooned (1969) and Woman in the Moon (1929). After Cuarón and his son, Jonás finished the screenplay, Cuarón attempted to develop his project at Universal Pictures, where it stayed in development for several years. After the rights to the project were sold, it began development at Warner Bros.|$|E
5|$|On 4 September, Mary Kom had {{its world}} premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, where {{it became the}} first Hindi film to be {{screened}} on the opening night of the film festival. It was initially released to 1500 screens worldwide. The film was released in overseas markets by Eros International {{as part of a}} four-film deal between Eros and Viacom 18 studios. The rights to television broadcasting belonged to Viacom18's flagship general entertainment channel Colors. The film was not released in Kom's home state of Manipur because of the ban on Bollywood films by the Imphal-based separatist militant group, Revolutionary Peoples Front (RPF) since 2000. In an interview with Press Trust of India, Kom expressed her sadness that people from her own state would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her biopic. However, unauthorised DVDs and VCDs flooded the state, with the DVD format in great demand as the only option for native people to watch the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation was}} carried out by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB, precursor to the NTSB). It emerged that pilot Roger Peterson had over four years of flying experience, of which one with Dwyer Flying Service, and had accumulated 711 flying hours, of which 128 on Bonanzas. He had also logged 52 hours of instrument flying training, although had passed only his written examination, and was not yet qualified to operate in weather that required flying solely by reference to instruments. He and Dwyer Flying Service itself were certified to operate only under visual flight rules, which essentially require that the pilot must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> where he is going. However, {{on the night of the}} accident, visual flight would have been virtually impossible due to the low clouds, the lack of a visible horizon, and the absence of ground lights over the sparsely populated area.|$|E

5|$|With Sam {{closing in}} on Lilith, Castiel and Zachariah imprison Dean within an idyllic waiting room, where he will be made {{comfortable}} until the time comes for him to play his role in stopping the Apocalypse. Dean refuses to remain idle, and continually requests to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Sam, which is denied. Once Dean discovers the angels are allowing the Apocalypse to happen, he implores for Castiel to help him stop the final seal from being broken. Though Castiel refuses at first, he returns ready to help not long after. He takes Dean to see the prophet Chuck for information on Sam. Their presence does not fall in line with Chuck's Gospel, so the Archangel Raphael begins to descend. Castiel sends Dean to Sam, remaining behind {{to hold back the}} archangel and any others who might come. He is subsequently killed, with his host's body being blown to pieces.|$|E
5|$|Although {{historically}} unsubstantiated, {{the story}} of how Zoroastrians gained permission to step on the shores of Gujarat continues to be critical to the self-identity of the group. Per the commonly told narrative, the Rajah of Sanjan, summoned them and demanded to know how they wouldn't be a burden on or a threat to the indigenous communities. Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them a jug full of milk, saying Sanjan like it was full. In one version, a dastur added a coin to the milk, saying like the coin, no one would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that they were there but they would enrich the milk nonetheless. In another version, he added sugar instead and claimed that like it, they would sweeten lands of Sanjan. In both of them their settlement is approved by the Rajah who addresses certain conditions for it: they would explain their religion, promise not to prosletyize, adopt Gujarati speech and dress, surrender their weapons and only conduct their rituals after nightfall.|$|E
5|$|Fraser's {{experiences}} {{as an intern}} convinced her that she would prefer medical research to actual practice with patients. When she completed her New York internship in 1926, she moved to Philadelphia, after a brief visit home to Toronto to visit {{her mother and her}} brother Donald. In Pennsylvania, Fraser began her post-doctorate training under the direction of Muriel McPhedran at the Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment and Prevention of Tuberculosis in January 1927, specialising in bacteriology The experiences in her internships were markedly different in that in New York, she lived at the hospital and the staff was predominantly made up of women. In Philadelphia, she lived in her own apartment in the town and often had to struggle to be accepted as a doctor and <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> patients. In March, 1927, Fraser was offered a position in the Connaught Laboratories, a research facility dedicated to developing vaccines, where her brother worked. Accepting the position to begin {{at the end of her}} internship in October meant that she would not be joining Williams in England. Williams had hoped that Fraser would join her, where they might be able to live together, but recognized with the choice of going back to Toronto, that would not be possible.|$|E

5|$|Inside the apartment, Mulder's {{search for}} clues is {{interrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} The Smoking Man, who tells Mulder that he has been betrayed by Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens), who is actually his son. The Smoking Man tells Mulder that, many years ago, the Syndicate agreed by majority vote, against Bill Mulder's objections, to align with the alien colonists to be spared during colonization. The Syndicate was forced to give up family members to the colonists as collateral so that an alien fetus could be given to the Syndicate {{in order for them to}} gain access to alien DNA. Since Bill Mulder was slow to agree, Samantha Mulder was not taken until after the others. Using the fetus, the Syndicate worked on creating alien-human hybrids who could survive colonization. The Smoking Man tells Mulder that colonization will begin once Cassandra is handed over and that Mulder will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his sister again, providing him with an address to the hangar where the Syndicate members will be meeting the colonists.|$|E
5|$|As the {{bombardment}} {{of the city}} proved to be unsuccessful, Montgomery then began to plan for an assault. Montgomery was to assault the Lower Town district, {{the part of the}} city near the river shore, while Arnold was to attack and take the Cape Diamond Bastion, a strong part of the city walls on the highest point of the rocky promontory. Montgomery believed that they should attack during a stormy night, therefore the British would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them. On December 27, the weather became stormy, and Montgomery ordered that the men prepare to attack. However, the storm soon subsided and Montgomery called off the attack. As Montgomery waited for a storm, he was forced to revise his plans, because a deserter communicated the original plan to the defenders. In the new plan, Montgomery would attack the Lower Town from the south and Arnold would attack the Lower Town from the north. After breaking through the walls, Montgomery and Arnold would meet up in the city and then attack and take the Upper Town, causing resistance to collapse. To increase their chance of surprise, Montgomery planned two feints. One detachment of troops (the 1st Canadian Regiment under James Livingston) would set fire to one of the gates while another (under the command of Jacob Brown) would engage the guard at Cape Diamond Bastion and fire rockets to signal the start of the attack. While the feints were conducted, artillery would fire into the city. Although Montgomery was reluctant to attack, enlistments for Arnold's men were expiring on January 1, and he was concerned about losing their services.|$|E
5|$|However, {{although}} the spectators would now <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the players at night, they still {{suffered from the}} problem of obstructed views caused by the pillars that supported the roofs. With the 1966 FIFA World Cup fast approaching, this prompted the United directors to completely redesign the United Road (north) stand. The old roof pillars were replaced in 1965 with modern-style cantilevering {{on top of the}} roof, allowing every spectator a completely unobstructed view, while it was also expanded to hold 20,000 spectators (10,000 seated and 10,000 standing in front) at a cost of £350,000. The architects of the new stand, Mather and Nutter (now Atherden Fuller), rearranged the organisation of the stand to have terracing at the front, a larger seated area towards the back, and the first private boxes at a British football ground. The east stand – the only remaining uncovered stand – was developed in the same style in 1973. With the first two stands converted to cantilevers, the club's owners devised a long-term plan to do the same to the other two stands and convert the stadium into a bowl-like arena. Such an undertaking would serve to increase the atmosphere within the ground by containing the crowd's noise and focusing it onto the pitch, where the players would feel the full effects of a capacity crowd. Meanwhile, the stadium hosted its third FA Cup Final, hosting 62,078 spectators for the replay of the 1970 final between Chelsea and Leeds United; Chelsea won the match 2–1. The ground also hosted the second leg of the 1968 Intercontinental Cup, which saw Estudiantes de La Plata win the cup after a 1–1 draw. The 1970s saw the dramatic rise of football hooliganism in Britain, and a knife-throwing incident in 1971 forcing the club to erect the country's first perimeter fence, restricting fans from the Old Trafford pitch.|$|E
