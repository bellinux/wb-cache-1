40|$|Import 02 / 11 / 2016 The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis {{assignment}} was to design a new blast design for Mokra Quarry. Since Mokra Quarry was not a hypothetical mine but a mine with existing operations that incorporates current blasting works the new design was to serve as means to modernize the current blasting works. Blast design is important because good design produces desired fragmentation and reduces cost related to material handling or secondary blasting. The modernization of blasting works at the quarry required detail assessment of current blasting practices that are undertaken. Therefor a visit to Mokra Quarry was contacted to obtain information of current blasting parameters. During the field visit information on geology, bench geometry, explosives, detonators, <b>blast</b> <b>pattern</b> and firing system were recorded. Mine workers on site assisted with logistics and technical information. Based on the information gathered planning model was formulated that incorporates input data and predicted output (results).

40|$|Conventional {{drill and}} blast {{tunnelling}} consists of mainly seven elements which together makes a cycle. This cycle includes drilling and blasting which are crucial factors in tunnelling projects, as these {{have a major}} influence on how the project will progress. After blasting there can be occurrences of under-break with so called bootholes in it and a re-blast is needed. This is expensive and time-consuming, and is therefore indefensible due to causing extra costs as well as a delay in the completion of the whole project. A solution for this problem is needed to avoid blasting second times. Due to laws regulating the allowed fracture zone in tunnel-blasting, contour blasting is performed. The reason behind why bootlegs emerges after blasting is still unknown and depends on many varied factors, such as geology, <b>blast</b> <b>pattern</b> and the volume of explosives used. Different tests are done while blasting, thereafter the results are evaluated and documented. Each test was tried three times to get as a most reliable result as possible. Among others the amount of explosives ranged, double detonators in poor rock sections and a new drill plan was made. The main theory behind this project was that the problem with bootlegs mainly depended om poor geological situations in the rock. None of the test however have been successful enough to solve the problem and after almost every blast there where bootholes in the remaining rock. Recommendations for further testing are using a less amount of explosives as this was a successful method in Björkdalsgruvan in northern Sweden. Another thing worth giving a try is to remove the “helping-row” because it seems like it is breaking the contour-row and not doing any difference...|$|E
40|$|Blasting {{has been}} the most {{frequently}} used method for rock breakage since black powder was first used to fragment rocks, more than two hundred years ago. This paper is an attempt to reassess standard design techniques used in blasting by providing an alternative approach to blast design. The new approach has been termed asymmetric blasting. Based on providing real time rock recognition through the capacity of measurement while drilling (MWD) techniques, asymmetric blasting is an approach to deal with rock properties as they occur in nature, i. e., randomly and asymmetrically spatially distributed. It is well accepted that performance of basic mining operations, such as excavation and crushing rely on a broken rock mass which has been pre conditioned by the blast. By pre-conditioned we mean well fragmented, sufficiently loose and with adequate muckpile profile. These muckpile characteristics affect loading and hauling [1]. The influence of blasting does not end there. Under the Mine to Mill paradigm, blasting has a significant leverage on downstream operations such as crushing and milling. There is a body of evidence that blasting affects mineral liberation [2]. Thus, the importance of blasting has increased from simply fragmenting and loosing the rock mass, to a broader role that encompasses many aspects of mining, which affects the cost of the end product. A new approach is proposed in this paper which facilitates this trend 2 ̆ 7 to treat non-homogeneous media (rock mass) in a non-homogeneous manner (an asymmetrical pattern) in order to achieve an optimal result (in terms of muckpile size distribution). 2 ̆ 7 It is postulated there are no logical reasons (besides the current lack of means to infer rock mass properties in the blind zones of the bench and onsite precedents) for drilling a regular <b>blast</b> <b>pattern</b> over a rock mass that is inherently heterogeneous.
