5|$|A similar {{situation}} arose outside the apartment. A crowd gathered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of 5A, including {{next to the}} children's bedroom window—through which an abductor may have entered or left—trampling on evidence. An officer dusted the bedroom window's exterior shutter for fingerprints without wearing gloves or other protective clothing.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Mulder shows Scully some tracks <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of {{the house}} that appear to be human. Based on the weight distribution, however, the assailant evidently travels on the balls of its feet rather than from heel to toe. Additionally, that the {{creature}} lured the mother out {{of the house}} {{in order to get to}} Louis suggests to Mulder that the creatures are paranormal in nature.|$|E
25|$|While {{being treated}} with respect in Europe, {{segregation}} still ruled American society. When Sports Illustrated invited Winkfield to a reception at the Brown Hotel in Louisville in 1961, {{he was told he}} couldn't enter <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|Late on the {{afternoon}} of the 6th of March, Mary Ross entered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> half-opened <b>front</b> <b>door</b> at Hollywell, just as Charles appeared slowly descending the stairs.|$|R

60|$|Five {{minutes more}} went <b>by,</b> and then <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> house opened and Martin came out.|$|R
25|$|When {{the film}} ended, Purvis stood <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and {{signaled}} Dillinger's exit by lighting a cigar. Both {{he and the}} other agents reported that Dillinger turned his head and looked directly at the agent as he walked by, glanced across the street, then moved ahead of his female companions, reached into his pocket but failed to extract his gun, and ran into a nearby alley. Other accounts stated Dillinger ignored a command to surrender, whipped out his gun, then headed for the alley. Agents already had the alley closed off, but Dillinger was determined to shoot it out.|$|E
25|$|The form of home {{automation}} called assistive domotics focuses on {{making it possible}} for elderly and disabled people to live independently. Home automation is becoming a viable option for the elderly and disabled who would prefer to stay in their own homes rather than move to a healthcare facility. This field uses much of the same technology and equipment as {{home automation}} for security, entertainment, and energy conservation but tailors it towards elderly and disabled users. For example, automated prompts and reminders utilize motion sensors and pre-recorded audio messages; an automated prompt in the kitchen may remind the resident to turn off the oven, and one <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> may remind the resident to lock the door.|$|E
25|$|As {{his celebrity}} {{grew in the}} late 1950s, he grew tired of being {{approached}} by strangers, and particularly disliked being visited by them at home. Another of his unverifiable stories had him keeping a suitcase <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> {{so that he could}} claim to be just leaving, a practice he claimed to have abandoned after a helpful young man insisted on taking him to the railway station and had to be sent off to buy a paper so that Lowry could buy a ticket for just one stop without revealing his deceit. However, he was polite to the residents of Mottram, who respected him and his privacy; he used the bus to get about the area in his retirement. A bronze statue of him was erected at the traffic lights in the village.|$|E
5000|$|On 18 April 1966 {{the first}} central area [...] "standee" [...] was introduced. [...] "Red Arrow" [...] Service 500 was a Monday-Friday service linking Victoria station to Park Lane in peak hours {{and to the}} {{shopping}} district of Oxford Street in off peak hours. In a break from tradition, the new buses were not designed specifically for London use, but were based on an existing manufacturer's model. The vehicles chosen were rear-engined 36 foot m long AEC Swifts, which London Transport christened Merlins. These wore a special red and flake grey livery, and had a standing area for 48 passengers and a raised seating area at the rear for 25 passengers. Passengers entered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors,</b> where there twin coin-operated turnstiles (known as [...] "passimeters"), with a flat fare of sixpence.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} morning Nancy {{arrives at the}} house and is greeted <b>by</b> Maurice at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> On entering, Magda asks her to remove her shoes as they create too much noise. The childrens shoes are lined up in the entrance hall...|$|R
50|$|In August 1996, Fortensky {{was arrested}} for drug use after police in Hemet, California found him in an {{illegally}} parked luxury motor home with no license plates with a woman he identified as his live-in maid. Fortensky, whose black BMW was parked <b>by</b> <b>the</b> home's <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> refused to allow police to search the motor home, but {{was arrested for}} being {{under the influence of}} drugs at the time.|$|R
25|$|At 0100 on 1 April 2003, the Marines {{commenced}} their deception mission, CIA elements cut the city's {{power as}} the helicopters approached their objective, the AH-6s led the way, behind them the MH-6s dropped off Task Force 20 sniper teams at strategic locations around {{and on the}} hospital. The DAPs and the AH-6s covered the MH-60Ks as they dropped off assault teams on the hospital roof and another <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> the ground assault convoy arrived and the assaulters raced inside and onto the second floor where Lynch was located. 13 minutes later, a MH-60K touched down near the hospital entrance {{with a team of}} PJs and SOAR medics on board and transported Lynch to Talil where it rendezvoused with a standby medical flight and then onto Kuwait and finally the United States. The Hospital was devoid of any Fedayeen, although evidence suggested they were using it as a base; the Ranger blocking teams experienced some sporadic direct fire, the SEALs and the Rangers eventually recovered the remains of eight members of Lynch's unit that had been killed or died of their wounds. Task Force 20 carried out the first successful US POW rescue mission since World War II.|$|E
2500|$|Before the 1977–1980 modernisation, the {{stations}} had a distinctive earthy odour. The trains (mostly {{dating back to}} 1896) were always formed with two carriages — the front (motor) carriage with red leather seats and the rear (trailer) carriage with brown leather seats. Smoking was permitted in the rear carriage only. The backs of the seats were attached {{to the sides of}} the carriages, which moved semi-independently from the floor (to which the seats themselves were attached); passengers were rocked forwards and backwards while the carriage 'shoogled' them around. Passengers always entered at the middle of the train ("Q Here" [...] signs were painted on the platforms), leaving <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of the front carriage or the rear door of the rear carriage.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2006, it was {{revealed}} that several other young girls had received phone calls similar to that to which Mihaljevic responded, during the weeks prior to her abduction in 1989. These comprised requests from an unknown man, claiming to work with their mother, asking the girl to help him shop for a present to celebrate her mother's job promotion. The girls who received these calls lived in North Olmsted, a suburb near Bay Village; some had unlisted phone numbers. [...] This new information was considered significant [...] by new movement on the case. Mihaljevic and the others who received such calls had all visited the local Lake Erie Nature and Science Center, which had a visitors' logbook <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> that the girls may have signed, possibly adding other personal information such as addresses.|$|E
50|$|Most of the Cucuteni-Trypillia {{houses were}} {{arranged}} <b>by</b> locating <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> opposite {{from where the}} fireplace sat. Large ceramic pottery containers used to store water and grain were placed next to the fireplace. Other ceramic containers, including the more valuable painted pottery, would also be located near the fireplace. Some of the fine painted pottery for which this culture is known {{would be used for}} clothing storage but most of it seems to have been used in rituals.|$|R
50|$|In 1796, Poland Township was {{the first}} charted {{township}} in the Connecticut Western Reserve, being the southeastern most portion (Township 1, Range 1). The township was founded by Jonathan Fowler, who {{fell in love with}} Yellow Creek which flows through Poland. He owned an inn near the river which still stands as the oldest building in Poland. The historical buildings of Poland have a sign in the shape of Ohio <b>by</b> <b>the</b> building's <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the police}} located the embassy {{caretaker}} {{and took him}} to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers. He informed them that <b>the</b> embassy's <b>front</b> <b>door</b> was reinforced by a steel security door, and that the windows on the ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass—the result of recommendations made after the SAS had been asked to review security arrangements for the embassy several years earlier. Plans for entering <b>the</b> embassy <b>by</b> battering <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.|$|R
60|$|Sure enough, our visitor {{had passed}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> and was walking toward us. Evidently {{she had heard}} our voices.|$|E
60|$|No sooner {{said than}} done. In three minutes {{he was at}} the Hall and, as it chanced, met Sir John <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure, Tuppence, {{how could}} he be? This door's open into the hall. No one could have come in <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> without our seeing and hearing him." ...|$|E
50|$|At 3:30 am, Josh Koscheck and Southworth {{continue}} {{to drink and}} then decide to pull a prank on Leben, by spraying water on the Team Couture member while he is sleeping. This wakes Leben, and causes him {{to go on a}} rampage <b>by</b> punching <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> window with his left hand, which cuts his knuckle skin off. Leben then punches Forrest Griffin's door in half, and Griffin later comments that there are pieces of the bedroom door in his bed.|$|R
60|$|A moment later, with peals {{of happy}} laughter, {{we had taken}} hands and were running along the garden alleys towards the house. And I remember, as we ran, finding it {{somewhat}} singular that this {{should be the first}} time I had ever invaded Swanston Cottage <b>by</b> way of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Masterson and {{the others}} were left inside the courthouse, so they {{immediately}} took up positions on the second floor to return fire. The Cimarron men attempted to storm <b>the</b> building <b>by</b> rushing <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> but were beaten back by [...] "deadly shots" [...] from the remaining raiders. After that failed, the Cimarron men attempted to breach <b>the</b> building <b>by</b> raising a ladder up to a window {{in the back of the}} building. This plan was also thwarted when Masterson found out and kicked down the ladder.|$|R
60|$|The sitting-room {{door opened}} and closed behind her as she slipped up-stairs, and her father, without the {{formality}} of leave-taking, quietly let *himselt out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{only knew}} where to get a doctor," [...] he mused. Then {{he ran out of}} the house <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and {{looked up and down the}} road.|$|E
6000|$|... "Libbard doesn't take so gloomy {{a view of}} poor Emily's health." [...] Mr. Hutton held {{open the}} gate that led from the garden into the drive; Miss Spence's car was {{standing}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{jazz and}} jazz harmony, the chord {{progression}} from ii7 or, IV7 [...] to VII7, to I has been nicknamed the backdoor progression or the backdoor ii-V, {{as described by}} jazz theorist and author Jerry Coker. This name derives from an assumption that the normal progression to the tonic, the ii-V-I turnaround (ii-V7 to I, see also authentic cadence) is, <b>by</b> inference, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> It {{can be considered a}} minor plagal cadence with IV and VII being both subdominant and VII being borrowed from minor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{door at the}} Crazy Wisdom {{bookstore and}} tea shop on S. Main Street is <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> entrance. Two <b>doors</b> can be opened to view the inside, or what's on the other side, of the fairy door, which {{features}} a small dwelling of some sort.|$|R
5000|$|Sold as the Valiant J series, the South African {{assembled}} Chrysler Valiant lineup {{included the}} Rebel, Rebel 660, Regal, Regal Safari, and the VIP. During 1975 the [...] "J½ series" [...] appeared, first as the VIP only but gradually spreading down the range. Sound deadening was improved, while the Regal sedan {{also received a}} new [...] "iso-clamp" [...] rear axle insulator. The Regals also received new seats, while all J½ series Valiants could be recognized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ventless <b>front</b> <b>door</b> windows.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Faber was in it, and {{she stopped}} it {{outside the gate}} and made signals. Mrs. Britling, {{attracted}} by the catastrophic sounds of Mrs. Faber's vehicle, came out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> {{and she and her}} husband both converged upon the caller.|$|E
6000|$|... "A--well, never mind, never mind!" [...] said Farfrae cheerily. [...] "Eight o'clock will do {{well enough}} if it be not later. Now, don't ye be {{standing}} here talking, or it will be twelve, I doubt." [...] Thus speaking he went out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and up the street.|$|E
60|$|She had {{not seen}} him--but she had felt his presence--and she was quite sure that she had heard the hissing sound of his indrawn breath and the {{movement}} which he had made to spring on her--and strangle her, as he had threatened to do--if she went out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|As {{she stood}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> great <b>front</b> <b>door</b> {{and looked up}} at the wide staircase, and into the lofty rooms upon each side, there came to her, rising above all sentiments of amazement, delight, and pride in her new possessions, a feeling of {{animated}} and inspiring encouragement. The mists of doubt and uncertainty, which had hung over her, began to clear away. This noble edifice must have cost grandly! And, for the first time, she began to feel that she might yet be equal to her fortune.|$|R
50|$|The House at 15 Chestnut Street in Wakefield, Massachusetts {{is a well}} {{preserved}} high style Colonial Revival house. It {{was built}} in 1889 for Thomas Skinner, a Boston bookkeeper. The -story wood-frame house is topped by a hipped roof with flared eaves and a heavily decorated cornice. A porch extends across <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> house, which is supported by paired turned columns. Above on the porch is a low railing with paired pillars (matching the support columns in position) topped <b>by</b> urns. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> is flanked <b>by</b> Ionic pilasters, then sidelight windows, and then another pair of pilasters.|$|R
50|$|Actual notice may be {{contrasted with}} {{constructive}} notice, {{which is a}} way of giving notice that may not immediately bring the matter {{to the attention of the}} individual that is intended to receive the notice. Constructive notice includes, among other methods, service on an agent or family member, service <b>by</b> posting (on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door),</b> and service <b>by</b> publication (as in a newspaper).|$|R
