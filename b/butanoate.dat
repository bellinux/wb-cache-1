5000|$|Butyric acid (from Greek βούτῡρον, meaning [...] "butter"), {{also known}} under the {{systematic}} name butanoic acid, abbreviated BTA, is a carboxylic acid with the structural formula CH3CH2CH2-COOH. Salts and esters of butyric acid {{are known as}} butyrates or <b>butanoates.</b> Butyric acid is found in milk, especially goat, sheep and buffalo milk, butter, parmesan cheese, and {{as a product of}} anaerobic fermentation (including in the colon and as body odor). It is also suspected to be found in milk chocolate produced by the Hershey process, or added to imitate the flavour of Hershey's chocolate. Butyric acid is present in, and is the main distinctive smell of, human vomit. It has an unpleasant smell and acrid taste, with a sweetish aftertaste similar to ether. Mammals with good scent detection abilities, such as dogs, can detect it at 10 parts per billion, whereas humans can only detect it in concentrations above 10 parts per million.|$|R
40|$|A new polymer-supported 2 -phosphoranylidene acetates 52 (denominated as “linker reagents”) was established, {{that allows}} the free {{variation}} of substituents in all relevant positions of the core structure including the P 1 site chain, that addresses the S 1 -pocket of the proteases. C-Acylations of polymer-supported 2 -phosphoranylidene acetates 52 on polymeric support are introduced as a flexible entry point to the C-terminal variation of carboxylic acids. Conditions for the efficient acylation of the phosphoranes with protected amino acids and the subsequent derivatization of the obtained 2 -acyl- 2 -phosphoranylidene acetates 53 were investigated. Several alternative cleavage conditions were established: Oxidative cleavage yielded peptidyl 4 -amino- 2, 3 -dioxo <b>butanoates</b> (peptidyl- 2, 3 -Diketoesters) 55; saponification on the polymer support led via decarboxylation to the peptidyl- 3 -amino- 2 -oxo- 1 -phosphoranylidene propanes 56. These intermediates could be cleaved either oxidatively with DMDO furnishing peptidyl- 3 -amino- 2 -oxo-propanals (peptidyl-α-ketoaldehydes) 57 or with by reaction with aldehydes yielding peptidyl- 1 -amino- 3 -buten- 4 -ones (peptidyl vinyl ketones) 58.

40|$|The thermal {{behaviour}} of Ln(C$_{ 3 }$H$_{ 7 }$CO$_{ 2 }) _{ 3 }$ (Ln = Er, Tm, Yb or Lu) was {{studied in}} argon from room temperature {{by means of}} thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis up to 1400 °C, by infrared spectroscopy, hot-stage optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Melting prior to decomposition was observed in all four compounds, but its course depends on the rare-earth element. Decomposition to sesquioxides proceeds via the formation of dioxymonocarbonates (Ln$_ 2 $O$_ 2 $CO$_ 3 $) and release of 4 -heptanone (C$_ 3 $H$_ 7 $COC$_ 3 $H$_ 7 $) as well as carbon dioxide (CO$_ 2 $) without evidence for an intermediate oxobutanoate stage. During the decomposition of Ln$_ 2 $O$_ 2 $CO$_ 3 $ into the respective sesquioxides (Ln$_ 2 $O$_ 3 $), an intermediate plateau extending from approximately 550 to 850 °C appears in the TG traces. The overall composition during this stage corresponds approximately to Ln$_ 2 $O$_{ 2. 8 }$(CO$_ 3 $) $_{ 0. 2 }$, but the state is more probably a mixture of Ln$_ 2 $O$_ 2 $CO$_ 3 $ and Ln$_ 2 $O$_ 3 $. The stability of this intermediate state seems to decrease with {{the mass of the}} rare-earth elements. Complete conversion to Ln$_ 2 $O$_ 3 $ is reached at about 1100 °C. The overall thermal decomposition behaviour of the title compounds is different from previous reports for other rare-earth <b>butanoates...</b>|$|R

40|$|Practical {{solutions}} for the preparation of enantiomerically pure compounds (EPC) by enantioselective synthesis have now been found for most important organic reactions, and {{for a number of}} economically important classes of organic compounds. This author-review, therefore, covers only representative examples of those methods to which the author 2 ̆ 7 s group made some contribution. Non-catalytic preparation of chiral molecules can be achieved either by separation of racemic mixtures, or by enantioselective synthesis using stoichiometric quantities of a chiral auxiliary agent. Examples of various separations of racemic 1, 4 -benzodiazepines will be given. Non-catalytic enantioselective preparation of specific a-amino acids and some therapeutically important compounds, will examplify the use of chiral auxiliaries, derived from the »chiral pooh of Nature. Biocatalytic transformations of chiral molecules that are not natural substrates of the enzymes, represent a rapidly growing field of application of enzymes and microorgasnisms in organic synthesis. Recently, we successfully used microbial lipases for enantioselective hydrolysis of some precursors of C 3 and C 4 chiral synthons, for kinetic resolution of rac 3 -(2 -nitrophe- noxy) <b>butanoates,</b> precursors for l, 5 -benzoxazepin- 4 (5 H) -ones with ACH inhibitory activity, and also in chemoenzymatic syntehsis of S-fenpropimorph, the biologically active enantiomer of a commercially important fungicide. Complete stereoselectivity in the hydrolysis and acylation of resorcyclic acid macrocyclic lactones, intermediates in the production of a-zearanol, a commercially important growth-promoting agent, catalyzed by microbial lipases, prompted us to propose a new »helical model« for interaction of substrates with the Pseudomonas sp. lipase active site...|$|R
40|$|Development of multidrug {{resistance}} (MDR) to antimicrobial, antiparasitic and chemotherapeutic agents {{is a global}} challenge for the scientific community. Despite {{of the emergence of}} MDR pathogens, the development of novel and more effective drugs is slow and scientist even speculate that we are going back the pre-antibiotic era. This work aims to study and evaluate the preliminary antibacterial, anthelmintic and cytotoxic potentials of ethyl 3 -oxo- 2 -(2, 5 -dioxopyrrolidin- 3 -yl) <b>butanoates.</b> Among all of the four compounds, compound 2 has displayed remarkable potency with MIC values of 0. 125, 0. 083, 0. 073, and 0. 109 mg/ml against E. sakazakii, E. coli. S. aureus, and K. pneumonia, respectively. Compared to etoposide (LC 50 9. 8 μg/ml), the compounds demonstrated LC 50 values from 280 to 765 μg/ml. For anthelmintic assay, three concentrations of each compound and standard drug were studied in determination of time of death of the two species. Excellent anthelmintic activity was observed by all four compounds against P. posthuma and A. galli better than standard albendazole. High GOLD fitness score data from docking analysis toward the targets represent better protein–ligand binding affinity and thus indicate a high propensity for all the active compounds to bind to the active site. The promising in-vitro antimicrobial, anthelmintic activity, and cytotoxicity data conclusively revealed that these compounds may serve as viable lead compounds for the treatment of bacterial and parasitic infections, and therefore, could help the medicinal chemists to design future chemotherapeutic agents to avoid rapid drug resistance...|$|R
