In 1881, still painted in her original colours of a black hull with a gold band and pink <b>boot</b> <b>topping</b> as shown, she was refitted with a Bell Coleman refrigeration machine, with which she took the first load of frozen meat from New Zealand to the United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|Ben-my-Chree {{originally}} entered {{service in}} the Steam Packet's traditional black livery.This changed, when she was chartered by the North Lancashire Roman Catholic organization to take passengers to the Eucharistic Conference being held in Dublin in 1932. It was agreed that {{she was to be}} painted white with green <b>boot</b> <b>topping,</b> the work was undertaken by Vickers Armstrong for a consideration of £63.However the charter was not taken up because the sleeping accommodation on board the Ben-my-Chree was considered insufficient for the would-be charterers. The Steam Packet Board decided to retain the colour scheme, as it was believed that white and green would have a definitive advertising value when the vessel was in the Mersey. The Lady of Mann was painted white for the 1933 season and the Mona's Queen was launched as a white ship in 1934.|$|E
40|$|En este trabajo se presentan experiencias con sistemas anticorrosivos marinos efectuadas durante el período 1968 / 69 en la balsa de Mar del Plata. 							Los resultados obtenidos con pinturas oleoresinosas aplicadas sobre paneles arenados, demostraron que el esquema utilizado (numero de manos) y el pretratamiento del acero (empleo de {{wash primer}} vinílico) son las {{variables}} más importantes a considerar. Se estima entre 150 y 180 micrones el espesor mínimo a aplicar. 							Con pinturas vinílicas, tres manos de fondo anticorrosivo y tres de pintura de línea de flotación (100 micrones) resultan eficaces para la protección de las placas de acero. En la zona sumergida dos manos de pintura antifouling completan los esquemas ensayados. New experiencies with anticorrosion marine paint systems, performed {{during the period}} 1968 / 69 in Mar del Plata's port, are described • The results obtained with oleoresinous paints applied on steel sand blasted panels, have demonstrated that the paint system (number of coats) and the pretreatment of the steel (employ of a vinyl wash- primer) {{are the most important}} variables to be considered. The thickness to be used in this type of paints was estimated between 150 to 180 microns. 							With vinyl paints, three coats of anticorrosion primer, and three of the <b>boot</b> <b>topping</b> paint (100 microns system) is very efficient to protect the steels plates in raft's trials. In the underwater zone, two coats of antifouling paints are employed to complete the protective coating...|$|E
