In the case of two-dimensional systems with two delays, we obtain an explicit characterization of approximate and exact controllability in terms of the parameters of the problem.

The main results are that agents over-estimate the authorities' desired realignment rate, so inflation will be high in anticipation; but as the authorities do not actually devalue, there is a terms of trade loss leading to recession.
