In this method, alcohol is fermented to vinegar in a continuously stirred tank, and oxygen is supplied by bubbling air through the solution.

5|$|Modern {{experimental}} {{archaeology and}} history re-enactment have shown {{there is only}} a very short step from the Catalan forge to the true blast furnace, where the iron is gained as pig iron in liquid phase. Usually, obtaining the iron in liquid phase is actually undesired, and the temperature is intentionally kept below the melting point of iron, since while removing the solid bloom mechanically is tedious and means <b>batch</b> <b>process</b> instead of continuous process, it is almost pure iron and can be worked immediately. On the other hand, pig iron is the eutectic mixture of carbon and iron and needs to be described to produce steel or wrought iron, which was extremely tedious in the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{currently}} known {{processes for}} extracting titanium from its various ores are laborious and costly; {{it is not}} possible to reduce the ore by heating with carbon (as in iron smelting) because titanium combines with the carbon to produce titanium carbide. Pure metallic titanium (99.9%) was first prepared in 1910 by Matthew A. Hunter at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute by heating TiCl4 with sodium at 700–800°C under great pressure in a <b>batch</b> <b>process</b> known as the Hunter process. Titanium metal was not used outside the laboratory until 1932 when William Justin Kroll proved that it can be produced by reducing titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) with calcium. Eight years later he refined this process with magnesium and even sodium in what became known as the Kroll process. Although research continues into more efficient and cheaper processes (e.g., FFC Cambridge, Armstrong), the Kroll process is still used for commercial production.|$|E

Small facilities may prepare a solution of soluble sugars. Others may find compatible agricultural wastes, or offer disposal incentives to septic tank pumpers during low use periods.|$|E
500|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{operate on}} the principle of chemical reduction whereby carbon monoxide, having a stronger affinity for the oxygen in iron ore than iron does, reduces the iron to its elemental form. [...] Blast furnaces differ from bloomeries and reverberatory furnaces in that in a blast furnace, flue gas is in direct contact with the ore and iron, allowing carbon monoxide to diffuse into the ore and reduce the iron oxide to elemental iron mixed with carbon. [...] The blast furnaces operates as a countercurrent exchange process whereas a bloomery does not. Another difference is that bloomeries operate as a <b>batch</b> <b>process</b> while blast furnaces operate continuously for long periods because they are difficult to start up and shut down. (See: Continuous production) [...] Also, the carbon in pig iron lowers the melting point below that of steel or pure iron; in contrast, iron does not melt in a bloomery.|$|E

2500|$|In {{its earlier}} {{versions}} however, {{it was a}} <b>batch</b> <b>process,</b> rather than continuous, and many patents were {{to follow in the}} USA and Europe, though not all were practical. In 1924, a delegation from the American Sinclair Oil Corporation visited Shukhov. Sinclair Oil apparently wished to suggest that the patent of Burton and Humphreys, in use by Standard Oil, was derived from Shukhov's patent for oil cracking, as described in the Russian patent. If that could be established, it could strengthen the hand of rival American companies wishing to invalidate the Burton-Humphreys patent. In the event Shukhov satisfied the Americans that in principle Burton's method closely resembled his 1891 patents, though his own interest in the matter was primarily to establish that [...] "the Russian oil industry could easily build a cracking apparatus according to any of the described systems without being accused by the Americans of borrowing for free".|$|E
2500|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} can {{be performed}} as a <b>batch</b> <b>process</b> or a continuous process. In a batch system, biomass {{is added to the}} reactor {{at the start of the}} process. The reactor is then sealed for the duration of the process. In its simplest form batch processing needs inoculation with already processed material to start the anaerobic digestion. In a typical scenario, biogas production will be formed with a normal distribution pattern over time. Operators can use this fact to determine when they believe the process of digestion of the organic matter has completed. There can be severe odour issues if a batch reactor is opened and emptied before the process is well completed. A more advanced type of batch approach has limited the odour issues by integrating anaerobic digestion with in-vessel composting. In this approach inoculation takes place through the use of recirculated degasified percolate. After anaerobic digestion has completed, the biomass is kept in the reactor which is then used for in-vessel composting before it is opened [...] As the batch digestion is simple and requires less equipment and lower levels of design work, it is typically a cheaper form of digestion. Using more than one batch reactor at a plant can ensure constant production of biogas.|$|E
2500|$|Techniques {{have been}} {{developed}} to produce nanotubes in sizable quantities, including arc discharge, laser ablation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and high-pressure carbon monoxide disproportionation (HiPCO). Among these arc discharge, laser ablation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) are batch by <b>batch</b> <b>process</b> and HiPCO is gas phase continuous process. Most of these processes take place in a vacuum or with process gases. The CVD growth method is popular, as it yields high quantity and has a degree of control over diameter, length and morphology. Using particulate catalysts, large quantities of nanotubes can be synthesized by these methods; But achieving the repeatability becomes a major problem with CVD growth. The HiPCO process advances in catalysis and continuous growth are making CNTs more commercially viable. [...] In India, the company called [...] is producing high purity single walled carbon nanotubes by NoPo HiPCO Process. It is also commercially available at lower cost. HiPCO process helps in producing high purity single walled carbon nanotubes in higher quantity. NoPo HiPCO reactor operates at higher temperature ~1000°C under high pressure ~20-100 bar. It uses carbon monoxide as the carbon source and Nickel/ iron penta carbonyl as catalyst. These catalyst acts as the nucleation site for the nanotubes to grow.|$|E

40|$|Most {{processes}} can {{be divided}} into two classes: <b>batch</b> <b>processes</b> and continuous <b>processes.</b> In general, <b>batch</b> <b>processes,</b> which run intermittently, are best suited to low-volume and high-value products. Due to the high value of products, much more requirements are proposed for the control performance of <b>batch</b> <b>processes.</b> Hence, the plants become more and more complicated to achieve the high requirements. Consequently, the process complication exposes the possibility of system faults. Therefore, there is a trade-off between high performance and reliability. Fault-tolerant control (FTC) should be a good choice to handle this trade-off. Unfortunately, the reported work on FTC for <b>batch</b> <b>processes</b> is scarce. Trying our best, only four papers in the subject area were found by the authors. Therefore, both great challenges and opportunities exist in this field. Compared to continuous <b>processes,</b> <b>batch</b> <b>processes</b> have mainly three features: repetitive nature, finite duration, and nonlinear property. Generally, faults {{can be divided}} into three classes based on their location; FTC methods include two classes according to whether fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is used; in addition, the proposed scheme could be linear or nonlinear. By means of these criteria, the existing papers are categorized. Thanks to these categorizations, some promising directions will be presented in this paper. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Close process {{monitoring}} (i. e., detection and identification of disturbances) {{is important to}} achieve high process efficiency and safety. The Tennessee Eastman process is an extensive benchmark dataset for fault detection and identification, {{but it is only}} representative for continuous processes because it does not contain the inherent non- stationarity that complicates monitoring of <b>batch</b> <b>processes.</b> Nevertheless, <b>batch</b> <b>processes</b> also {{play an important role in}} many types of industry.
