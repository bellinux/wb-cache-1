Canned <b>beans</b> may have a salty flavor, which can be reduced by rinsing and then draining them. Fresh cooked <b>beans</b> may contribute to a more flavorful dish compared to using canned <b>beans.</b> Prepared canned green chili peppers are also sometimes used as a main ingredient.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is the Westernized {{release of}} the puzzle game Puyo Puyo and replaces all of its {{characters}} with those from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. The entirety of gameplay takes place across two grid-based boards: the left board {{is used by the}} player, while the right board is controlled by either artificial intelligence or a second player, depending on the game mode. The main objective of the game is to earn as many points as possible by grouping the same coloured <b>beans</b> together as they fall down on the board. The player must arrange <b>beans</b> into groups of at least four of the same colour; should they do this, the <b>beans</b> in the group will disappear and points will be accumulated. If the player drops a group of <b>beans</b> on an uneven surface, any bean left hanging will separate from the original group and will drop to the lowest point on the board. The player may also flip a group of falling <b>beans</b> horizontally or vertically.|$|E

5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The <b>beans</b> are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The <b>beans</b> are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual <b>beans</b> through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A <b>beans</b> from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of <b>beans</b> based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The <b>beans</b> are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser <b>beans,</b> which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E
5|$|The {{technicians}} {{wash the}} <b>beans</b> {{several times to}} remove {{the remains of the}} skin and coating and put them out on shaded racks to dry. Cooperative employees turn the <b>beans</b> regularly as technicians spot and remove bad <b>beans.</b> A longer drying process of up to two weeks in the sun follows (with provision for quick covering in the event of rain), again with constant turning. This last process reduces the water content of the bean from 40 percent to 12 percent.|$|E

The experimental treatments consisted of sole cropping of corn, white <b>bean,</b> bush <b>bean,</b> red <b>bean,</b> pinto <b>bean</b> and sword <b>bean</b> and 50 : 50 ratio of corn and <b>bean</b> types. In this experiment, the corn-bush <b>bean</b> and corn-pinto <b>bean</b> intercropping had the highest seed yield (5734. 4 and 5674. 3 kg/ha- 1, respectively) and land equivalent ratio (LER= 1. 13 and 1. 21, respectively). Evaluated intercropping indices indicated that red <b>bean</b> (k= 1. 85), pinto <b>bean</b> (k= 2. 41) and sword <b>bean</b> (k= 2. 80) had the highest crowding coefficient whereas the maximum aggressivity value was belonged to pinto <b>bean</b> intercropped with corn (A= - 0. 02).

Also, both the red <b>bean</b> and pinto <b>bean</b> (CR= 0. 75 and CR= 0. 98, respectively) had the maximum competitive ratio. Furthermore, the most corn crowding coefficient (K= 1. 15) was belonged to corn and sword <b>bean</b> intercropping and maximum corn aggressivity value was observed in corn intercropped with white <b>bean</b> (A=+ 0. 60) and bush <b>bean</b> (A=+ 0. 69).
