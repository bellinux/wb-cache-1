40|$|The use of {{biofuels}} {{in domestic}} transportation {{sector in the}} United States and European Union is attributed mainly to the <b>binding</b> <b>mandates,</b> Renewable Fuel Standard in the US and European Directive on the Promotion of Renewable Energy in the EU. The mandates have triggered production of first generation technologies that {{have been around for}} centuries and use food crops like corn or sugarcane as inputs and the second generation technologies that are still being developed but rely on cellulose or waste material. This raises important questions, {{what are the implications of}} policy mandates and biofuel production on land use change, global food crop prices and fuel blend technology as the <b>binding</b> <b>mandates</b> will rely mainly on first generation fuel technologies for the foreseeable future. Most analysis of policy mandates and biofuel production technologies leave out the land use change impact assessment. To investigate the questions I focus on how the mandates in the US and EU interact with land use. I use a computable general equilibrium framework, the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, which captures full economy-wide impacts of policy mandates and land use. I have developed a mechanism to integrate the first and second generation technologies, the transportation sector, and land use for policy impact analysis. I simulated the policy mandates through a permit trading system which is constrained by the blend wall technology of the underlying vehicle transportation fleet. I find that the global biofuel crop land requirement over 2005 to 2030 time frame is 44 percent higher with the mandates. The land requirement is met primarily by the reallocation of non-biofuel crop land and partially by pasture, natural grass and harvested forest lands. The long term food crop prices increase by less than 1 % per year with mandates as land productivity improvements dampen the impact of biofuel production on prices. In the case of global biofuel free-trade Brazil becomes the largest producer which reduces the deforestation in Brazil by 7 percent. I also find that fuel blend-wall acts as an implicit constraint on the domestic biofuel use as it limits the total vehicle fuel consumption. by Suhail Ahmad. Thesis (S.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} an ethanol import tariff {{in conjunction with a}} consumption mandate and tax credit. A tax credit alone acts as a subsidy to ethanol producers, equally benefiting exporters like Brazil. If an import tariff is imposed to offset the tax credit, world prices of ethanol decline by less than the tariff (unless oil prices are unaffected). Eliminating the tariff with a tax credit in place results in a significant gain to exporters like Brazil but eliminating the tax credit too reduces the initial benefits to Brazil of the tariff reduction substantially. The results change however if there is “water” in the tax credit. Then exporters benefit much more with the elimination of both the tariff and tax credit compared to a situation of both policies in place. If only a mandate was in place, exporters like Brazil again benefit as much as domestic ethanol producers do. Eliminating the tariff with a mandate results in an increase in domestic ethanol prices (even if oil prices do not change) because more domestic supply is required to maintain the mandate. The tariff therefore has a smaller negative impact on world ethanol prices with a mandate compared to a tax credit. A tax credit with a <b>binding</b> <b>mandate</b> is a subsidy to fuel consumers and only indirectly benefits ethanol producers if ethanol prices increase due to increased demand for ethanol with the increase in fuel consumption). Therefore, eliminating the tax credit with a <b>binding</b> <b>mandate</b> has little effect on market prices of ethanol – domestic and foreign producers alike benefit very little with a tax credit in this situation. Brazil would much prefer the elimination of the tax credit and the so-called offsetting import tariff when a mandate is binding. Hence, the protective effects of an import tariff are not additive with either a tax credit or the price premium due to a mandate. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} effect of agronomic {{uncertainty}} on bioenergy crop production as well as endogenous commodity and biomass prices on the feedstock composition of cellulosic biofuels under a <b>binding</b> <b>mandate</b> in the United States. The county-level simulation model focuses on both field crops (corn, soybean, and wheat) and biomass feedstocks (corn stover, wheat straw, switchgrass, and Miscanthus). In addition, pasture serves as a potential area for bioenergy crop production. The economic model is calibrated to 2022 in terms of yield, crop demand, and baseline prices and allocates land optimally among the alternative crops given the binding cellulosic biofuel mandate. The simulation scenarios differ in terms of bioenergy crop type (switchgrass and Miscanthus) and yield, biomass production inputs, and pasture availability. The cellulosic biofuel mandates range from 15 to 60 billion L. The {{results indicate that the}} 15 and 30 billion L mandates in the high production input scenarios for switchgrass and Miscanthus are covered entirely by agricultural residues. With the exception of the low production input for Miscanthus scenario, the share of agricultural residues is always over 50 % for all other scenarios including the 60 billion L mandate. The largest proportion of agricultural land dedicated to either switchgrass or Miscanthus is found in the southern Plains and the southeast. Almost no bioenergy crops are grown in the Midwest across all scenarios. Changes in the prices for the three commodities are negligible for cellulosic ethanol mandates because most of the mandate is met with agricultural residues. The lessons learned are that (1) the share of agricultural residue in the feedstock mix is higher than previously estimated and (2) for a given mandate, the feedstock composition is relatively stable {{with the exception of one}} scenario...|$|E
40|$|The ethanol blend {{wall and}} high RIN prices {{has become a}} {{controversial}} policy issue. We develop a model showing how RIN prices reflect the costs of overcoming the blend wall, namely biodiesel consumed in excess of its mandate and expansion of E 85 sales. These costs are very high and are shown to be borne by producers and consumers of ethanol and gasoline. Although RIN prices reduce consumer prices of ethanol in both the E 10 and E 85 blends, the net price of E 10 rises because obligated parties, who are required to purchase RINs, recoup the cost by passing on higher gasoline prices to blenders. This tax on gasoline production {{to pay for the}} subsidy on all ethanol consumption and RIN prices are a means of payment for “excess” RINs that are required to pay for costs overcoming the blend wall. Burkholder (2015) and EPA (2015) emphasize this first round subsidy that also increases ethanol market prices. But these papers downplay the overall increased costs of fuel to consumers due to RINs taxing gasoline producers, and the separate adverse market effects of a binding blend mandate. The latter has been missing in the debate where it is often implied that the RIN price represents {{the degree to which the}} ethanol mandate is binding. We show the RIN price represents the costs of overcoming the blend wall and the ethanol price premium due to the binding blend mandate reflects costs of the RFS itself. Our model determines RIN prices, the costs of overcoming the blend wall and the relationship with the ethanol price premium due to the <b>binding</b> <b>mandate.</b> We use economic theory consistent with the reality of the RFS and its associated complexities. From our empirical simulations, we find RIN prices went up because of the costs of the blend wall. Increasing the mandate with a blend wall caused E 10 prices and market gasoline prices to increase, along with an increase in ethanol consumption and market prices. But ethanol and market prices would increase far more without a blend wall for the same increase in the mandated volume. In addition to the costs of overcoming the blend wall, our analysis finds the cost of the mandate price premium for ethanol to fuel consumers is $ 53. 7 billion between 2007 and 2014, and to consumers of crops (including animal agriculture) by $ 285. 4 billion per year worldwide. Our model also obtains the result that the RFS of the 2007 EISA is infeasible with exponentially increasing volume mandates under two situations. First, the E 85 price goes to zero with ever increasing RIN prices. Second, when we assume costs of E 85 sales expansion levels off at $ 2 per gallon with the ethanol price peaking and then slowly declines (with E 85 and E 10 consumption). This may explain why the EPA scaled back the RFS...|$|E

40|$|The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{proposed}} in November to reduce 2014 biofuel mandates. One concern expressed by EPA {{is that it}} will be difficult, if not impossible, to consume the 2014 target levels of ethanol in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) because of infrastructure issues. Difficulty in meeting ethanol mandates is reflected into increased compliance costs and a measure of compliance cost is the price of the tradable ethanol credit known as a RIN (Renewable Identification Number). The price of RINs represents the gap between the cost of producing another gallon of ethanol and the price of ethanol that is needed to induce consumers to buy another gallon. Compliance with the ethanol mandates falls to owners of oil refineries who must purchase a specified number of RINs per gallon of gasoline produced. We show in previous work that increasing the number of stations that sell E 85 decreases the ethanol price discounts needed to induce enough ethanol consumption to meet targets by making the fuel more accessible to consumers. Any reduction in required discounts directly leads to lower RIN prices and hence lower compliance costs. Thus, obligated parties faced with high RIN prices would have a strong incentive to invest in the infrastructure that would facilitate increases in ethanol consumption. As the cost of complying with RFS falls to owners of oil refineries, it is a natural position for them to oppose any further increase in mandated ethanol volumes. One argument that has often been made by the oil industry against increases in ethanol is that compliance costs will be passed on to consumers. This seems like a reasonable argument because this type of cost increase in any economic model will tend to lead to higher gasoline prices, hence higher consumer prices. Our objective in this study is to provide a transparent economic analysis of the impact on consumer fuel prices from increased ethanol mandates. One feature of our analysis is that it accounts for an increase in the consumption of E 85, the most likely compliance path that would be taken in 2014 to meet increases in ethanol mandates. Each year, EPA establishes a percentage standard for ethanol by dividing the desired quantity of ethanol by the total anticipated domestic sales of unblended gasoline. Each producer of gasoline has an RVO (Renewable Volume Obligation) that is determined by multiplying the percentage standard by total domestic sales of gasoline. The RVO is met by acquiring RINs. If an obligated party’s sales of gasoline increases, so too does the RVO. This means that an obligated party can reduce the number of RINs that it needs to comply with the RFS by decreasing the volume of gasoline sales. This direct link between the cost of RINs and gasoline sales implies that increases in the cost of RINs reduces the quantity of gasoline that refiners will provide to consumers at any given gasoline price. Our model has separate demand curves for E 10 and E 85. The two demand curves are related because increases in E 85 consumption {{come at the expense of}} E 10. The model calculates the retail price of E 85 that is needed to induce consumers to buy enough ethanol so that the number of RINs generated is adequate to meet oil refineries’ RVO obligations. The obligations are met through increased E 85 consumption and reduced E 10 consumption. Increased E 85 consumption can only occur with a lower retail price of E 85. Given E 10 and E 85 prices, we can calculate the value at wholesale for gasoline and ethanol. It is the difference between the value of ethanol at wholesale and the cost of producing the required quantity of ethanol that determines the RIN price. The compliance cost to oil refineries per gallon of gasoline is the product of the RIN price and the percentage standard. We find two direct effects of a <b>binding</b> ethanol <b>mandate.</b> The first is an increase in the wholesale price of gasoline because positive RIN prices increase the cost of producing gasoline. The second is a decrease in the ethanol price paid by blenders net of the RIN value. The net price of ethanol will decrease to induce consumers to consume enough ethanol to meet the mandate. Because most US consumers buy E 10, the lower price of ethanol in the blend offsets at least some portion of the increased gasoline price. In addition to these two direct effects on the price of E 10, there exists an indirect effect that works to lower E 10 prices. To meet mandates beyond E 10 requires an increase in E 85 consumption, which results in a decrease in E 10 consumption because some owners of flex vehicles switch fuels. The effect of substituting E 85 for E 10 is a net decrease in gasoline demand, which results in some reduction in wholesale gasoline prices. Whether the net effect of these three market forces results in a net increase or decrease in E 10 pump prices requires the development of an economic model to sort out. We developed and calibrated such a model with the purpose of showing how feasible increases in ethanol blending mandates will affect the price of E 10 under a range of possible conditions. We find that feasible increases in the ethanol mandate in 2014 will cause a small decline in the price of E 10. That is, even though increased mandates increase gasoline prices, the offsetting effects from a decline in ethanol price and movement by motorists to E 85 from E 10 are enough to result in a net decrease in the price of E 10. Our results should reassure those in Congress and the Administration who are worried that following the RFS commitment to expanding the use of renewable fuels will result in sharply higher fuel prices for consumers. There may be sound policy reasons that could justify Congress revisiting the RFS. However, concern about higher pump prices for consumers is not one of them...|$|R
40|$|On December 26, 2004, {{the world}} has {{evidenced}} {{one of the most}} horrible tragedies in history of humankind. Land administration sector was also badly influenced by the catastrophe. The cadastral offices in Province of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam (NAD) and Nias were severely damaged by the tsunami. Most of cadastral records were lost or destroyed. The ground benchmarks, natural and man-made objects were also destroyed by tsunami and/or clearing out works in the tsunami affected areas. With nothing left on the ground, the land administration processes should be started from the scratch. The Government of Republic of Indonesia (GoI) was quickly responding by publishing five-year master plan of rehabilitation and reconstruction of NAD and Nias, especially on the spatial layout and land affairs. Unfortunately, many have criticised the GoI’s master plan. Besides its macro scale (Kamil, 2005), Fitzpatrick (2005) underlined the relocation camps and coastal buffer zones proposals as promoting disquiet among Acehnese. Many of Acehnese just wanted to go home and resettled their houses in the exactly same location as their previous houses that are swapped by tsunami (Montlake, 2005). NAD is well-know by its uniqueness among other Indonesian provinces since NAD has entirely different cultural background. As most of Indonesian region used to be ruled by Hindu and Buddha kingdom, NAD had only been ruled by several Islamic sultanates in different periods of time. Therefore, NAD has a strong Islamic culture. The implementation of Syariah, Islamic Law, has been strengthening the Islamic background of NAD. Besides its strong Islamic background, Acehneses have also different customary land administration system than other Indonesian provinces. The Acehneses’ customary land administration system is basically originated from the Islamic culture. The Acehneses’ customary land administration system is basically intending to maintain sustainable development and promoting equality for every Acehneses to enjoy the outcome of development. In order to focus on efforts of rehabilitating and reconstructing Banda Aceh, this study only highlights two out of three components of land administration, which are land tenure and land use. Land valuation, which is another component of land administration, is not included within this study due to the collapse of local governmental institution that is in charge in the valuation of land, as well as due to the prohibition of land transfer before the land administration system in Banda Aceh is working properly. In this study of land administration in post-disaster areas in Banda Aceh, the effectiveness of policy of GoI on rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh is being evaluated. The evaluation of policy of GoI on rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh is performed with special references to the Acehneses’ customary land administration system, land administration theories and cases, Indonesian land administration policy and regulation and progress on rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh. During the performance of this research, interviews and literature study were held to gather information on above mentioned special references. Interviews were held in Banda Aceh, Jakarta and Bandung and covered {{the point of view of}} the decision maker, professional and intellectual on land administration field, as well as the aspiration of Acehneses and particularly the citizens of Banda Aceh. On the other hand, the literature study was particularly performed for collecting information on land administration theories and cases in post conflict areas. Moreover, information regarding Indonesian general and special land administration laws, regulations and policies for Banda Aceh was gathered during the performance of the literature study. Additionally, the aspiration of Acehneses, particularly the citizens of Banda Aceh was also acquired from the literature study, to complete the information gathered by interviews. Having evaluated the contribution of Acehneses’ customary land administration system, it is concluded that the customary land administration system is still wanted to be applied in Banda Aceh, even though the Indonesian land administration system has been applied in there for almost half of a century. Some immediate actions on rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh that are not in accordance with the customary background of Acehneses, such as titling the land under Indonesian land tenure regime, could still be applied during the phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction. However, the customary land administration system is still wanted by the Acehneses and particularly citizens of Banda Aceh to be applied in Banda Aceh in the future. For evaluating effectiveness of policy of GoI on rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh, a land administration system performance evaluation framework is developed in this study. The evaluation framework in this study is developed based on conventional land administration theories, as well as adopting the cadastral evaluation framework of Soft System Theory (see Barry, 1999; Augustinus and Barry, 2004). The land administration system performance evaluation framework comprises of three evaluation frameworks, which are evaluating the compliance level of land administration system and its components to the needs and wants of Banda Aceh citizens, as well as the fulfilment of objectives of the higher system of land administration. Having compared the Indonesian land administration system and its implementation to the land administration theories, as well as to the state of land administration in Banda Aceh, Indonesian land administration system is lack of compliance with the land administration problems in rehabilitation and reconstruction of Banda Aceh. Several basic problems have been identified, such as dualism of land administration regime and lack of fulfilment of land registration features that are simplicity, security, affordability, currency and sustainability, as well as lack of realism, binding power, participation/consultation and human resource in Indonesian land use system. Due to existence of previously mentioned basic problems, which leads to bad-operated and ineffective land administration system in Indonesia, immediate efforts are needed to address the land administration problem in rehabilitation and reconstruction of Banda Aceh. GoI, its representative and its partners in rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh therefore have formulated regulations and guidelines regarding the rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh. Having evaluated the policy of GoI on rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh, it is concluded that the main problems of land administration in post-disaster areas, which are insecurity of land tenure and needs to address the effect of the catastrophe and disaster mitigation in spatial plan of Banda Aceh, have almost been solved. The policy of GoI on land administration in post-disaster areas in Banda Aceh also provides a means to fill the gap in Indonesian land administration regulatory framework, which could be employed as well in the future for advancing Indonesian land administration system. Nevertheless, adoption of breakthroughs proposed by and performed under the policy of GoI on land administration in post-disaster areas in Banda Aceh might not be able to fully fill the holes left by Indonesian land administration system, such as the recognition of Acehneses’ customary land tenure (known as Hak Ulayat in Indonesian land tenure system) and no <b>binding</b> power <b>mandated</b> to relevant governmental institutions to enforce the implementation of spatial plan. Without efforts to address the basic problems in Indonesian land administration system, the land administration state in post-disaster areas in Banda Aceh might return to its initial state, even after fully accommodating the previously mentioned breakthroughs in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh. Therefore, besides adopting breakthroughs in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh, this study recommends the government to provide supportive regulations to adapt to the customary background of Acehneses and Indonesia in general, as well as supportive regulations and procedures for accelerating the rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration system in Banda Aceh. This study also recommends GoI to train and educate land administration professionals for ensuring the good performance of land administration, as well as to address the basic Indonesian land administration problems.
