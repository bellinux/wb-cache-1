5|$|Now a five-piece, Uncle Tupelo {{recorded}} {{their major}} label debut at Cedar Creek studio in Austin, Texas in early 1993. Anodyne consisted of live-in-the-studio recordings and included {{a duet with}} Farrar and Doug Sahm of the Sir Douglas Quintet. The album sold 150,000 copies, and was their only entry on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. The group toured {{until the end of}} the year, finishing with a sold out concert at Tramps in New York City. Because of their concert draw, major executives at Sire <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> band as a potential hit.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} lifting off at sunrise in Japan, the men <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> sun rise again over the Yukon—it {{was a very}} short day for them, and none {{had been able to}} sleep for the {{excitement}} of the trip, the stimulant benzedrine, and the penetrating cold. Crossing into Canada, the headwinds grew stronger still, and a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings. Though the B-29s had been delivered to the war front complete with deicing equipment, such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed. The ice load picked up in the night would have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World {{begins with}} an {{introduction}} by Andrew Altman. This is followed by eighteen essays broken into five sections arranged by topic.

The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted in situations of self-defense in military settings; after the attacks {{it was used to}} kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force.|$|E

5|$|Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World is a non-fiction {{compilation}} {{book about}} targeted killing edited by Claire Finkelstein, Jens David Ohlin, and Andrew Altman. It {{was published by}} Oxford University Press in 2012. The book grew out of contributions by the authors to a conference in April 2011 at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Targeted Killings features eighteen essays in five sections arranged by topic. The work argues that after the 11 September attacks by Al-Qaeda in 2001, the United States and other countries <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> tactic of targeted killing differently. The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted in situations of self-defence in military settings; after 11 September 2001 {{it was used to}} kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force.|$|E
5|$|In 1613, {{his sister}} Elizabeth married Frederick V, Elector Palatine, {{and moved to}} Heidelberg. In 1617, the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, a Catholic, was elected king of Bohemia. The {{following}} year, the Bohemians rebelled, defenestrating the Catholic governors. In August 1619, the Bohemian diet chose as their monarch FrederickV, who was leader of the Protestant Union, while Ferdinand was elected Holy Roman Emperor in the imperial election. Frederick's acceptance of the Bohemian crown {{in defiance of the}} emperor {{marked the beginning of the}} turmoil that would develop into the Thirty Years' War. The conflict, originally confined to Bohemia, spiralled into a wider European war, which the English Parliament and public quickly grew to see as a polarised continental struggle between Catholics and Protestants. In 1620, Charles's brother-in-law, Frederick V, was defeated at the Battle of White Mountain near Prague and his hereditary lands in the Electoral Palatinate were invaded by a Habsburg force from the Spanish Netherlands. James, however, had been seeking marriage between the new Prince of Wales and Ferdinand's niece, Habsburg princess Maria Anna of Spain, and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Spanish match as a possible diplomatic means of achieving peace in Europe.|$|E

25|$|Smuts now <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> present {{agitation}} in {{a different}} light.

Some bands like Stone Angel and Jack the Lad, who had disbanded in the 1970s, now reformed and resumed a recording or touring career.|$|E

25|$|Criticisms {{included}} {{a failure to}} inspire passion in the team {{and a lack of}} depth in the squad, which has been said to have caused complacency in the first team players. Many <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> signing of his contract as a premature move. Rumours have abounded of conflict in the Irish during the tournament, and even that Geordan Murphy might leave the squad as a result of being dropped from the bench for the French game.|$|E

The theater underwent a $6.2-million renovation and expansion project, completed in 2007.

25|$|French {{domination}} lasted {{less than}} 20 years, and it differed from previous foreign {{control of the}} Italian peninsula. In spite of heavy taxation and frequent harshness, the French introduced representative assemblies and new laws that were {{the same for all}} parts of the country.

25|$|With {{most players}} {{returning}} from the failed North Warrandyte venture for the 1961/62 season, the club also <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> fruits of its junior team when it fielded a 3rd eleven {{for the first time}} in 1963/64. One junior, Mark Davis, who would go on to be President and a Life Member, amassed a stunning 142 in the under 14s competition in 1965. But despite the growing numbers, the depth of quality in the 1st XI was lacking, and they failed to make the finals in every season in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Change {{became more}} rapid towards {{the close of}} the 1960s, as {{mainline}} churches including the Anglicans <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> first wave of evaporation from the pews. On 23 August 1967, the Anglican Church of Canada agreed to permit the remarriage of divorced persons in their churches. Ecumenical relationships were intensified, with a view to full communion. While negotiations with the largest Canadian Protestant denomination, the United Church of Canada, faltered in the early 1970s, the Anglican Church achieved full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada as the century drew to a close.|$|E

25|$|The {{literary}} sublime, {{as well as}} the philosophical, aesthetic sublimes, {{is inherently}} connected to nature but, as with most literary terms, the sublime evolved alongside literature. More authors began to connect the natural sublime to an internalized emotion of terror. Authors <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> sublime, with its inherent contradictions (pain and pleasure, terror and awe) as representative of the changing political and cultural climate of the times. They began to incorporate more aspects of the sublime into their literary works as a way of externalizing their inner conflicts. In this way, the sublime particularly appealed to the Romantics.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s some <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> {{advancing}} {{theories in}} ecofeminism as essentialist. Through analysis done by post structural and third wave feminists it was argued that ecofeminism equated women with nature. This dichotomy is dangerous because it groups all women into one category and enforces the very societal norms that feminism {{is trying to}} break. Out of this critique rose the anti-essentialist argument. Ecofeminist and author Noel Sturgeon says {{in an interview that}} what anti-essentialists are critiquing is a strategy used to mobilize large and diverse groups of both theorists and activists.|$|E
25|$|Woolman worked {{within the}} Friends' {{tradition}} of seeking {{the guidance of}} the Spirit of Christ and patiently waiting to achieve unity in the Spirit. As he went from one Friends' meeting to another, he expressed his concern about slaveholding. Gradually various Quaker Meetings <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> evils of slavery; their minutes increasingly reflecting their condemnation of the practice. Quaker records bear witness to his and a few others' success – by the time the 1776–1783 revolution was over, almost all North American Quakers had freed their slaves, and those few Quakers who had been engaged in the trading or shipment of slaves had ceased such activities as well.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>the</b> Light is {{an essay}} {{collection}} by critic Ellen Willis. Originally published by Knopf in 1981 as <b>Beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>the</b> Light: Pieces of a Decade, it was subsequently republished in two more editions (Wesleyan University Press in 1992 and University of Minnesota Press in 2012) as <b>Beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>the</b> Light: Sex, Hope, and Rock-and-Roll. The book collects essays Willis wrote between 1967 and 1980. In Tablet, Emily Gould particularly praises the essay [...] "Next Year in Jerusalem" [...] for displaying Willis's [...] "ability, rare among {{even the most}} brilliant writers, to consider frightening ideas thoroughly and to hold contradictory ideas in her mind simultaneously, without prejudice or fear." ...|$|R
