This time they were to travel via Sardinia, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than 60–70 flights would be allowed per night; some 250 had been mounted daily before Flax. The transports also had to run the gauntlet of radar-equipped Bristol Beaufighters but these rarely were successful at intercepting them.|$|E

5|$|After Kiev, the Red Army {{no longer}} outnumbered the Germans {{and there were}} no more trained {{reserves}} directly available. To defend Moscow, Stalin could field 800,000 men in 83 divisions, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than 25 divisions were fully effective. Operation Typhoon, the drive to Moscow, began on 30 September 1941. In front of Army Group Center was a series of elaborate defense lines, the first centered on Vyazma and the second on Mozhaysk. Russian peasants began fleeing ahead of the advancing German units, burning their harvested crops, driving their cattle away, and destroying buildings in their villages as part of a scorched-earth policy designed to deny the Nazi war machine of needed supplies and foodstuffs.|$|E

5|$|Early {{observations}} {{have revealed}} a few genuinely hyperbolic (i.e. non-periodic) trajectories, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> {{than could be}} accounted for by perturbations from Jupiter. If comets pervaded interstellar space, they would be moving with velocities of the same order as the relative velocities of stars near the Sun (a few tens of km per second). If such objects entered the Solar System, they would have positive specific orbital energy and would be observed to have genuinely hyperbolic trajectories. A rough calculation shows that there might be four hyperbolic comets per century within Jupiter's orbit, give or take one and perhaps two orders of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round, {{as one of the}} twenty teams from the Premier League. They were drawn against Football League Championship side Luton Town, at Luton's home ground Kenilworth Road. Despite trailing 3–1 at the interval, four goals in the second half, including one from behind the halfway line by Xabi Alonso, meant Liverpool recovered to win the match 5–3 and progress to the fourth round. There, they were drawn against fellow top division club Porstmouth. The match held at Portsmouth's ground, Fratton Park, saw Liverpool take the lead in the first half when captain Steven Gerrard scored a penalty following a handball by Portsmouth defender Dejan Stefanović, and John Arne Riise scored again before half time to make it 2–0. Portsmouth got a goal back through midfielder Sean Davis in the second half, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> goals were scored and Liverpool won 2–1 to go through to the fifth round.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Maurice Friedman {{writes about}} the book {{in the context of}} the various {{attempts}} to find a universal essence - or perennial philosophy - within religion. He finds that Time and Eternity is a more systematic attempt at this than those proposed by Aldous Huxley or Ananda Coomaraswamy, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> successful. For Friedman, the philosophy that Stace lays out in the book is derived from metaphysical speculation (that, like the ideas of Huxley and Coomaraswamy, is influenced by Vedanta), rather than mystical experience. Central to Friedman’s critique is the notion that there is a vast gulf between the mystical experience which Stace defines as beyond thought, and his philosophical system built on this. He also mentions that mystics do not always agree on what experiences, symbols and philosophies are the closest to the divine.|$|E

5|$|There are 42 The Church of England dioceses, each {{being an}} {{administrative}} territorial unit {{governed by a}} bishop. These cover England, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands and {{a small part of}} Wales. The Diocese in Europe is also a part of the Church of England, and covers the whole of continental Europe, Morocco and the post-Soviet states. The structure of dioceses within the Church of England was initially inherited from the Catholic Church as part of the Protestant Reformation. During the Reformation a number of new dioceses were founded, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> were then created until the middle of the 19th century, when dioceses were founded mainly in response to the growing population, especially in the northern industrial cities. The most recent diocese to be established was the Diocese of Leeds, which came into being on 20 April 2014. Prior to that, no new dioceses had been founded since 1927. Leeds was created by combining three previous dioceses: the Diocese of Bradford, the Diocese of Ripon and Leeds, and the Diocese of Wakefield.|$|E
5|$|Titanic {{received}} six {{warnings of}} sea ice on 14 April but was travelling near her maximum speed when her lookouts sighted the iceberg. Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled her starboard (right) side and opened five of her sixteen compartments to the sea. Titanic {{had been designed}} to stay afloat with four of her forward compartments flooded <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more,</b> and the crew soon realised that the ship would sink. They used distress flares and radio (wireless) messages to attract help as the passengers were put into lifeboats. In accordance with existing practice, Titanic's lifeboat system was designed to ferry passengers to nearby rescue vessels, not to hold everyone on board simultaneously; therefore with the ship sinking rapidly and help still hours away, there was no safe refuge {{for many of the}} passengers and crew. Compounding this, poor management of the evacuation meant many boats were launched before they were completely full.|$|E
5|$|When Marseille {{returned}} to his unit he asked his friends Franzisket, Clade and Schröer, whether they had heard {{what was happening to}} Jews and if perhaps something was underway {{that they did not know}} about. Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more.</b> Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had vanished from his neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, or people changed the subject or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He never spoke of this with his comrades again.|$|E

5|$|Following the Italian {{invasion}} on 28 October 1940, Greece {{defeated the}} initial Italian attack and a counter-attack in March 1941. When the German invasion, known as Operation Marita, began on 6 April, {{the bulk of}} the Greek Army was on the Greek border with Albania, then a protectorate of Italy, from which the Italian troops had attacked. German troops invaded from Bulgaria, creating a second front. Greece had already received a small, inadequate reinforcement from British, Australian and New Zealand forces in anticipation of the German attack, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> help was sent afterward. The Greek army found itself outnumbered in its effort to defend against both Italian and German troops. As a result, the Metaxas defensive line did not receive adequate troop reinforcements and was quickly overrun by the Germans, who then outflanked the Greek forces at the Albanian border, forcing their surrender. British, Australian and New Zealand forces were overwhelmed and forced to retreat, with the ultimate goal of evacuation. For several days, Allied troops played an important part in containing the German advance on the Thermopylae position, allowing ships to be prepared to evacuate the units defending Greece. The German Army reached the capital, Athens, on 27 April and Greece's southern shore on 30 April, capturing 7,000 British, Australian and New Zealand personnel and ending the battle with a decisive victory. The conquest of Greece was completed with the capture of Crete a month later. Following its fall, Greece was occupied by the military forces of Germany, Italy and Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|The {{next few}} years were filled with travel and writing. There were further cruises with the {{training}} squadron, and extended visits to the Baltic and the Mediterranean. In 1893, {{during the course of}} one of these journeys, Markham was elected in absentia President of the RGS. This unexpected elevation {{was the result of a}} dispute within the Society over the question of women members, about which Markham had kept silent. When in July 1893 the issue was put to a special general meeting, the proposal to admit women was narrowly defeated despite an overwhelming postal ballot in favour. In these circumstances the Society's President, Sir Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff, resigned his office. The 22 existing women members were allowed to remain, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> were admitted until January 1913 when the RGS changed its policy. Although Markham was not the first choice as a replacement for Grant Duff—other notable figures were approached—he had kept out of the women members controversy and was broadly acceptable to the membership. Shortly after his accession to the presidency, in recognition of his services to geography Markham was raised in the Order of the Bath to the rank of Knight Commander (KCB), and became Sir Clements Markham.|$|E
25|$|As {{an agency}} of the Commonwealth, the Virginia Port Authority reports to the Virginia Secretary of Transportation. The Governor of Virginia {{appoints}} 11 citizens to form the Virginia Port Authority Board of Commissioners, and the state treasurer is an ex officio member of the Board. Commissioners serve staggered five year terms {{at the pleasure of}} the Governor, and no commissioner may serve more than two consecutive terms. Law dictates that there must be one, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than one, commissioner from Norfolk or Virginia Beach; one, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than one, commissioner from Portsmouth or Chesapeake; and one, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than one, commissioner from Hampton or Newport News. Traditionally, an active or retired senior executive from Norfolk Southern Railway and an individual with ties to the coal industry have also served as members of the Board.
