40|$|This thesis {{examines}} skin doses in {{the currently}} experimental field of Magnetic Resonance Image guided Radiotherapy (MRIgRT). This modality promises realtime MRI quality soft tissue resolution whilst x-ray beam treatment is occurring. The potential {{advantage of the}} high image resolution offered is the improved tracking of organ and tumour motion. This in turn will allow a more conformal treatment of the tumour tissue. The ultimate improvement is then the reduction of dose to healthy tissue whilst dose escalation to tumour cells. In turn this would lead toimproved survival rates of radiotherapy patients. At present this modality is still in an experimental stage however at least 2 prototype machines currently exist. Preliminary studies in the literature describe potential limitations of MRIgRT being related to excessive skin doses caused by the magnetic fields. Until this thesis no studies existed which predict the skin doses at a 10 micron resolution. This is particularly important in obtaining accurate estimates of the dose at the skin structure depths. This resolution reflects the biologically significant structures of the skin, hence the values are of direct clinical interest. In this thesis the skin dose from 6 MV photon beams has been studied both experimentally and theoretically. The effects of transverse magnetic fields on perturbing this dose has also been studied via Geant 4 Monte Carlo simulations. The skin dose arrises from the photon beam and it is altered by {{the effect of the}} magnetic field, in particular, the influence on the secondary electrons produced by the x-rays. Ion chamber and Attix chamber detector measurements have been used to confirm the accuracy of the Geant 4 Monte Carlo Model. A detailed Monte Carlo model has been used which utilises high resolution voxel scoring. This enables the extraction of the 70 μm skin doses, the epidermal, and the dermal skin doses in the entry and exit regions of various phantoms. Beam field sizes of 5 x 5, 10 x 10, 15 x 15, and 20 x 20 cm 2 have been simulated, exposed to magnetic fields ranging between 0 and 3 T. The effect of entry and exit surface orientation with respect to the beam central axis is also investigated over the range of + 75 ◦ to- 75 ◦. The skin doses have been calculated at the beam central axis, and over the entire entry and exit surfaces of the phantoms used. In the beam entry region the role of air-generated lepton contamination has been investigated. In transverse magnetic fields of 6 0. 4 T some lepton contamination is not fully removed by the magnetic field. Such contamination should be included in simulations to produce accurate skin dose calculations. The use of helium air-bags on the entry surface has also been simulated, however it has been shown not to be of benefit due to the the bolus effect of the helium <b>bag</b> <b>wall</b> material against the entry surface. There is a considerable entry skin dose increase predicted for strong magnetic fields (1 - 3 T) and large positive surface angles. This becomes 3 ̆e 100...|$|E

40|$|Odor {{nuisance}} {{has been}} a challenge to management of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and endanger {{the relationship between these}} facilities and neighbors. A systematic methodology was developed to investigate and understand odor nuisances from WWTPs, and provide practical solutions to solve these problems. The study of this methodology includes the incorporation of both chemical and sensorial methods, optimization of sampling techniques, development of analytical methods for specific odorants, and understanding the masking effect of odorous mixtures. Both sensorial and chemical methods should be applied to investigate odor nuisance from wastewater facilities. Using chemical analysis alone is not able to clarify the problem because there is a gap between the method reporting limit (MRL) and odor threshold concentration (OTC) of odorants. Sensorial methods, such as odor profile method (OPM) and Detection/Threshold (D/T) method should be used to bridge the gap. The OPM can determine the major odors presented and their intensities, and then narrow the major potential odorants to a manageable group. D/T determines the total odor and if there is an odor nuisance problem, while the OPM can define the odors and their intensities. The losses of volatiles and odorants in sampling bags have been reported in literature. Thus, the proper choice of sampling bags is needed for both sensorial and chemical analysis. The stability of wastewater odorants samples in sampling bags of Tedlar (polyvinyl fluoride film) and Teflon FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene film) was evaluated and compared. Quick losses of indole and skatole were found in Tedlar bag, with less than 5 % left after 15 minutes due to adsorption on the <b>bag</b> <b>wall,</b> while skatole and indole showed over 75 % recovery over 6 hours in Teflon bags. Thus, Teflon bags are required for the analysis of skatole and indole, which needs to occur within 6 hours of sample collection. Teflon bags also are preferred for both chemical and sensory analysis due their lower background of chemical and odorant contamination. Sensory- gas chromatography (Sensory GC) and GC-mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) with the OPM can identify primary odor causing chemicals that are causing the odor nuisance. GC-MS was applied to investigate the chemical sources of fecal and musty odorants identified by the OPM. Skatole and indole were found to be the primary chemicals leading to fecal odor, due to its odor concentration/ OTC (C/OTC) ratio that ranged from 2. 8 to 22. 5. 2 -Methylisoborneol (MIB) and 2 -isopropyl- 3 -methoxypyrazine (IPMP), that have been reported to cause musty odor in drinking water supplies, were identified as principal contributors to the musty nuisance odor at the WWTPs odor sources. The present ability of WWTP odor control treatment of these fecal odorants by different air pollution control methods was evaluated at different locations at two WWTPs by the OPM and indole and skatole chemical analysis. Chemical scrubbing and biofiltration performed best in removing fecal odors among current control technologies. The C/OTC ratio is a simple method to prioritize the odorants and employ both chemical and sensorial results to help eliminate them. The OTC of the nine “most detectable” odor characteristics by the OPM and D/T method and the odorants associated with these odors by the GC-MS and GC-Sensory Analyses at two WWTPs were determined based on Weber-Fechner curve. The Weber-Fechner Curve relates the Log of the Odor Intensity of each chemical causing the odor versus the Log of the Concentration of each odorant. The OTC of 2 -isopropyl- 3 -methoxypyrazine (0. 02 ng/L in air), methyl mercaptan (0. 2 ng/L in air), 2 -methylisoborneol (0. 1 ng/L in air), and skatole (0. 3 ng/L in air) were quite low. As dilution occurred, the intensities of both the fecal and the sulfur odors decreased. At the greater dilutions, musty odors appeared and the fecal and sulfur odors became undetectable. This is a masking of the odor, which is called “peeling the onion” effect. This masking effect was successfully evaluated in this study. Thus, this thesis for the first time identified and quantified the fecal odorants (indole and skatole), the musty odorants (IPMP and MIB) that cause odor nuisances from WWTPs, Analytical methodologies using the correct sampling bags were defined for the OPM and chemical analysis of these odorants. Also this thesis developed knowledge of the odor masking effect by odorous mixtures that are not sensorially observed at the WWTP, but could be observed off-site as an odor nuisance...|$|E

In 1969, in association with Ancher Mortlock Murray & Woolley, Clerehan designed the '3136' (a very efficiently planned small flat roofed three bedroom house, named for its 11 square size of 31x36 feet), which won the Project Home Award from the New South Wales chapter of the RAIA in both 1970 and 1971. The house was popular, reportedly selling three per week for a year, mostly in Sydney. In 1972 again with Ancher Mortlock Murray & Woolley, he designed an even smaller house, the '2937' (29x37 feet), which won the NSW Project Home Award for him again in 1973. The efficiency of both designs revolved around the placement of the bathroom in the centre of the house, lit by the then innovative domed acrylic skylight, the front door opening into the lounge space, and a very short, but extendable, corridor.|$|R

House Raynham takes the visitor on a journey that exploits the advantages of context through light, solar contact and the view of Table Mountain.
