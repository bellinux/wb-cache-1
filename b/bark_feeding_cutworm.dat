5|$|Bark {{and plant}} exudates such as tree sap are {{consumed}} {{by a few}} lemur species. The exploitation of exudates {{has been reported in}} 18 plant species and only in the dry regions in the south and west of Madagascar. Only the Masoala fork-marked lemur (Phaner furcifer) and Coquerel's giant mouse lemur regularly consume tree sap. Bark has never been reported as an important food item in lemur diets, but at least four species eat it: the aye-aye, the red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), the common brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus), and Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi). Most <b>bark</b> <b>feeding</b> is directly linked to exudate feeding, except for the aye-aye's <b>bark</b> <b>feeding</b> on Afzelia bijuga (genus Afzelia) at Nosy Mangabe in the northeast.|$|R

40|$|First paragraph: There are {{a number}} of reports in the {{literature}} of primates <b>feeding</b> on the <b>bark</b> of trees, but bark has only occasionally been considered as a major food to be studied in its own right (e. g., Waser, 1977; Beeson, 1987; Norris, 1988). All the great apes <b>feed</b> on <b>bark</b> at certain times, and clearly have preferences as to which species they choose (e. g., Schaller, 1963; Jones & Sabater Pi. 1971; Casimir, 1975 : Nishida, 1976; Goodall, 1977; Rodman, 1977; Sabater Pi, 1977, 1979). Evidence has been presented that <b>bark</b> <b>feeding</b> by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) is a seasonal phenomenon related to scarcity of preferred fruits (Nishida, 1976; Rodman, 1977), and similar conclusions have been drawn from studies of blue monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis) living near plantations of exotic pines (Beeson, 1987; Maganga & Wright, 1992). <b>Bark</b> <b>feeding</b> is also well known in other mammals where, again, it often occurs seasonally (e. g., elephants, Wing & Buss, 1970; grey squirrels, Kenward & Parish, 1986) ...|$|R

50|$|Many of {{the species}} are of great {{importance}} as cutworms, major agricultural pests whose larvae hide by day and emerge at night to <b>feed.</b> The name <b>cutworm</b> refers to the habit of the larvae, of cutting down and partly eating garden and crop plants, especially seedlings. Not all cutworms are in the genus Agrotis, though {{it may well be}} the genus that includes the largest number of cutworm species, and the most agriculturally important cutworm species.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Cryptomeria japonica and Chamaecyparis obtusa. The larvae bore {{into the}} <b>bark</b> and <b>feed</b> on the phloem of a {{standing}} tree. The cambium is injured, {{but since the}} damaged area is only small, the callus soon heals the damaged part and the tree continues to grow normally, but the scar and discolouration remain and increase annually. These scars lead to a degradation in the commercial value of the timber.|$|R

40|$|As {{habitat loss}} and {{fragmentation}} place growing pressure on endangered nonhuman primate populations, researchers find increasing evidence for novel responses in behavior. In western Uganda between the Budongo and Bugoma Forests, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) inhabit a mosaic landscape comprising forest fragments, human settlements, and agricultural land. We recorded nests and feeding evidence of unhabituated chimpanzees {{in this region}} over a 12 -mo period. We found extensive evidence of nesting in introduced tree species, including eucalyptus (Eucalyptus grandis), guava (Psidium guajava), cocoa (Theobroma cacao), and Caribbean pine (Pinus caribaea). In addition, we found instances of ground nesting, nest reuse, and composite nests constructed from branches of multiple trees. This evidence may indicate a lack of suitable nesting trees or attempts by chimpanzees to nest in areas of riparian forest {{that allow them to}} avoid human detection. We also found new evidence for eucalyptus <b>bark</b> <b>feeding</b> by chimpanzees. Such evidence suggests chimpanzees respond flexibly to mitigate anthropogenic pressures in human-dominated landscapes. The limits of such flexibility remain unknown. Further research is needed to examine systematically the factors influencing the use of such resources and to understand better the extent to which chimpanzees can persist while relying on them...|$|R
50|$|The white-tailed jackrabbit is nocturnal {{and lies}} {{up during the}} day in a form, a shallow {{depression}} in the ground hidden under vegetation, emerging at dusk to feed. The forms of this species range from 46 to 61 cm long, 20 to 30 cm wide, and up to 20 cm deep. Often, discernible paths lead away from the form and others among the plants at often-visited feeding sites. In winter snow, the forms are interconnecting, cave-like structures. This jackrabbit is a solitary species and feeds on grasses and other green plants, including cultivated crops. In southern Colorado, from summer through fall into winter, the diet varied from 70% (summer) to 4% (winter) forbs, 43% (fall) to 4% (winter) grasses and 76% (winter) to 7% (summer) scrubs. During the winter its diet includes buds, twigs and <b>bark</b> <b>feed</b> on off of low shrubs. It {{tends to be more}} selective in its feeding habits than the black-tailed jackrabbit which disadvantages it where their ranges overlap. It has good eyesight, excellent hearing, and sensitive whiskers and is probably able to detect olfactory clues as to whether another jackrabbit is ready to breed.|$|R
50|$|This <b>bark</b> beetle <b>feeds</b> on the {{developing}} bark on {{and around the}} root crowns of tree seedlings, especially the phloem. It also infests stumps, logs, and fallen trees. It prefers pines, and is a widespread pest of wild and cultivated Monterey pines (Pinus radiata) in particular. Other recorded host trees include silver fir (Abies alba), colonial pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), Port Orford cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), common larch (Larix decidua), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens).|$|R
50|$|Wildlife use {{the tree}} {{for food and}} nesting. Porcupines eat the inner <b>bark,</b> snowshoe hares <b>feeds</b> on {{tamarack}} seedlings, and red squirrels eat the seeds. Birds that frequent tamaracks during the summer include the white-throated sparrow, song sparrow, veery, common yellow throat, and Nashville warbler.|$|R
50|$|They {{puncture}} the <b>bark</b> and may <b>feed</b> {{for hours}} at a time. They expel waste fluid which can fall in a constant shower if there are large numbers of redeyes. Redeyes are also attracted to light. The female lays eggs in dead or dying plant tissue only.|$|R
50|$|D. semivitta {{is often}} found in sources of wood, such as timber or <b>bark</b> chips. It <b>feeds</b> off organic {{material}} but does not normally infest food. In cold weather, {{it can be found}} in roof cavities and the empty spaces between walls. D. semivitta is generally regarded as harmless.|$|R
50|$|The beetle {{develops}} {{under the}} bark of the tree and produces damage to the wood during pupation. The female lays clusters of eggs in cracks in the bark and the larvae feed on the inner bark and outermost layer of wood. They produce long, zig-zag galleries in the tissues of the tree as they dig. This action causes girdling of the tree, preventing the circulation of nutrients through its tissues. The following spring, the adults emerge through holes in the <b>bark</b> and <b>feed</b> on {{the leaves of the}} tree.|$|R
5|$|Decaying {{organic matter}} {{is a primary}} diet for many species. This can range from dung, which is {{consumed}} by coprophagous species (such as certain scarab beetles in the Scarabaeidae), to dead animals, which are eaten by necrophagous species (such as the carrion beetles, Silphidae). Some beetles found in dung and carrion are in fact predatory. These include members of the Histeridae and Silphidae, preying on the larvae of coprophagous and necrophagous insects. Many beetles <b>feed</b> under <b>bark,</b> some <b>feed</b> on wood while others feed on fungi growing on wood or leaf-litter. Some beetles have special mycangia, structures for the transport of fungal spores.|$|R
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of these beetles lasts two years. Larvae are oligophagous wood borers in {{coniferous}} trees, they live under the <b>bark</b> and mainly <b>feed</b> on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies), Abies and Larix species. Adult beetles can be found from May to August. Adult beetles feed on pollen of various flowers, especially on Heracleum sphondylium.|$|R
5000|$|The Mycetophagidae or hairy fungus beetles are {{a family}} of beetles in the large {{suborder}} Polyphaga. The different species are between 1.0 and 6.5 mm in length.

50|$|The name timber moths {{was coined}} by the Queensland naturalist Rowland Illidge in 1892, later {{published}} in 1895, and serves to distinguish these moths from other wood-boring Australian moths such as ghost moths (Hepialidae) and giant wood moths (Cossidae), which feed on sap or wood. It {{refers to the}} fact that the larvae of most members of this family are arboreal, whether they burrow into branches, bore into flower heads, tunnel under <b>bark,</b> or <b>feed</b> on lichens. Moths of the genus Maroga are pests of wattles (Acacia) and have crossed over from their wild host-plant to become serious pests of cultivated stone fruit trees, particularly cherries.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Acacia koa, Cyrtandra, Freycinetia, guava, Ipomoea, Lantana, Pipturus and Ricinus. The {{brownish}} larvae, {{protected by}} a silken web or tunnel, bore in the dead twigs of many plants. They also <b>feed</b> on the <b>bark</b> and may <b>feed</b> to some extent upon the living tissues. Larvae were also found in silken tunnels in and beneath dried cow dung.|$|R
50|$|Adults are on wing in mid July. The {{adults are}} unusual {{in that the}} wings are mostly clear, unlike those of most moths. The eggs are laid on the bark in early summer, usually near a wound or in scars or crevices. The larvae feed in tunnels on the inner bark and sapwood, causing a copious flow of pitch, which hardens on the <b>bark.</b> They <b>feed</b> for 2 or 3 years and attain a length of about 25 mm before pupating in the pitch mass. The larvae feed on pine and spruce species, {{including}} Austrian, eastern white, Scots and Jack pines as well as white, Norway and Colorado blue spruce. They create a large mass of pitch at the larval feeding site.|$|R

Cherry bark tortrix is known throughout Europe, south to coastal North Africa and west to Siberia.

50|$|Although the {{smooth-leaved elm}} is {{generally}} susceptible to Dutch elm disease, it is genetically a highly variable tree {{and it is}} possible some specimens survive in the UK owing to an innately high level of resistance (see Cultivation). Research currently (2009) in hand by Cemagref at Le Pepiniére forestiére de l'Etat, Guémené-Penfao, France, should confirm this. However, all smooth-leaved elm varieties are believed to have been introduced into Britain from central and southern Europe during the Bronze Age, and some, being beyond their natural climates and environments, may be growing slowly and thus producing smaller springwood vessels restrictive to the Ophiostoma fungus. Good performance in the field may also be owing to resistance to <b>bark</b> beetle <b>feeding</b> or breeding. Moreover, several types of this subspecies also have very pendulous twigs when mature, a factor which could also make them unattractive to foraging Scolytus beetles, which are disinclined to invert themselves.|$|R

40|$|Facilitation between {{species is}} thought to be a key {{mechanism}} in community assembly and diversity, as certain species create microhabitats for others. A profound characteristic of forest ecosystems is a large amount of dead wood which is colofiised by a vast array of invertebrate species. <b>Bark</b> beetles (Scolytinae) <b>feed</b> and breed on dying or dead trees, puncturing holes into the bark and engraving inner bark and outer wood with their galleries. These holes and galleries might facilitate other invertebrates by providing access to the inner <b>bark</b> for shelter, <b>feeding</b> and reproduction. We tested this hypothesised facilitative interaction during the early decomposition phase of coarse woody debris of spruce (Picea abies L Karst.) incubated in two environmentally contrasting forest sites in the 'common garden' experiment LOGLIFE. We sampled invertebrates in 25 cm diameter logs at different degrees of colonisation by bark beetles. Our results indicated that (1) bark beetles facilitated the entrance into spruce logs of other invertebrates with body width that matched the size of bark-beetle holes, and (2) the abundance of invertebrates was often positively related to the proportional surface area of inner bark consumed by bark beetles, but more so in the nutrient-rich site than in the nutrient poor site. This study provides the first quantitative test of facilitation between invertebrate clades in dead wood communities. Including facilitative interaction in community assembly studies may change some predictions about relationships between tree functional traits and invertebrate diversity and will lead to a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of dead wood communities.

Clones raised for testing are grown to an age of 3 or 4 years. In Europe, the [...] is introduced into the cambium by a knife wound. However this method, developed in the Netherlands, was considered too severe in America, where the principal disease vector is the bark beetle Scolytus multistriatus, a far less effective vector than the larger beetle endemic to Europe, Scolytus scolytus, which is unknown in America. In the method devised by the USDA, the inoculum is introduced to the cambium via a 2 mm-diameter hole drilled through the bark in the lower third of the tree. This method was further refined by the University of Wisconsin team, which drilled holes in the branches to simulate natural infection by the <b>bark</b> beetles <b>feeding</b> in the twig crotches, but results from this method were found to exaggerate the genetic resistance of the host. Consequently, tests were conducted on specimens in a controlled environment, either in greenhouses or customized plant chambers, facilitating more accurate evaluation of {{both internal and external}} symptoms of disease.|$|R
40|$|Of {{the more}} than 700 species in the genus Eucalyptus L’Heritier native to Australia and New Guinea, {{approximately}} 90 species have been introduced into North America over the last 150 years (Doughty, 2000). Eucalyptus trees were first propagated in California from seed brought from Australia. Insect pests and diseases associated with living trees were not introduced with the seeds. As a result, the trees growing in California were relatively free of pests until {{the last two decades}} of the twentieth century (Paine and Millar, 2002). Phoracantha semipunctata (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) is native to Australia but has been accidentally introduced into virtually all of the Eucalyptus-growing regions of the world, including California, and is causing significant tree mortality in many of those areas (Paine et al., 1993, 1995, 1997). The beetles are attracted to volatile chemical cues produced by downed Eucalyptus and Angophora Cav. trees, broken branches, or standing stressed trees that are suitable larval host material (Chararas, 1969; Drinkwater, 1975; Ivory, 1977; Gonzalez-Tirado, 1987; Hanks et al., 1991).
