40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we apply}} the Molecular Dynamics method [7] to the {{determination}} of the stable elastic equilibrium of a strut structure compressed beyond its critical <b>buckling</b> <b>loading.</b> In order to illustrate our approach, we consider a square network of elastic beams. The elastic energy of each beam is expressed in terms of the generalised isplacements of its ends. Therefore, the total energy can be expressed in terms of the displacements of the lattice nodes: U. The idea is to compute the solution as follows: each node is endowed with a virtual mass. Starting from arbitrary nodal displacements with zero velocity, we use Molecular Dynamics to compute the oscillations of the system during a prescribed period of time T. Then, we determine the moment 0 < to < T when the potential is minimum and we iterate the algorithm with initial nodal displacements fl (t 0), and so on. 1...|$|E

40|$|<b>Buckling</b> <b>loads</b> of {{thick-walled}} orthotropic and anisotropic {{simply supported}} circular cylinders are predicted using a higher-order transverse-shear deformation theory. A comparison of <b>buckling</b> <b>loads</b> {{predicted by the}} conventional first-order transverse-shear deformation theory and the higher-order theory show that the additional allowance for transverse shear deformation has a negligible effect on the predicted <b>buckling</b> <b>loads</b> of medium-thick metallic isotropic cylinders. However, the higher-order theory predicts <b>buckling</b> <b>loads</b> which are significantly lower than those predicted by the first-order transverse-shear deformation theory for certain short, thick-walled cylinders which have low through-the-thickness shear moduli. A parametric study {{of the effects of}} ply orientation on the <b>buckling</b> <b>load</b> of axially compressed cylinders indicates that laminates containing 45 degree plies are most sensitive to transverse-shear deformation effects.

40|$|This book {{concerns}} {{the development of}} novel finite elements for the structural analysis of composite beams and blades. The introduction of material damping {{is also an important}} aspect of composite structures and it is presented here in terms of their static and dynamic behavior. The book thoroughly presents a new shear beam finite element, which entails new blade section mechanics, capable of predicting structural blade coupling due to composite coupling and/or internal section geometry. Theoretical background is further expanded towards the inclusion of nonlinear structural blade models and damping mechanics for composite structures. The models effectively include geometrically nonlinear terms due to large displacements and rotations, improve the modeling accuracy of very large flexible blades, and enable the modeling of rotational stiffening and buckling, as well as, nonlinear structural coupling. Validation simulations on specimen level study the geometric nonlinearities effect on the modal frequencies and damping values of composite strips of various angle-ply laminations under either tensile or <b>buckling</b> <b>loading.</b> A series of correlation cases between numerical predictions and experimental measurements give credence to the developed nonlinear beam finite element models and underline the essential role of new nonlinear damping and stiffness terms...|$|E
40|$|An elastic string-elastic {{shell model}} is {{developed}} to study vibration behaviors of a carbon nanowire. The present model predicts that non-coaxial vibration between the C-chain and the innermost tube {{does not occur}} due to negligible bending rigidity of the C-chain. In addition, {{it is found that}} the C-chain has most significant effect on the lowest frequency associated with radial vibration mode for circumferential wave-number 2 (n= 2). In particular, the effect of the C-chain on axisymmetric radial breathing frequencies (n= 0) predicted by the present model is found to be in reasonable agreement with known experimental and modeling results available in the literature. To study the buckling of a carbon nanowire made of the C-chain inserted inside a CNT, not only the elastic string-elastic shell model that used above but also the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation are adopted. For radial buckling, both continuum model and MD simulation predict that C-chain increases buckling stress by more than 40 % to (2, 8), (0, 9), (3, 7) and (5, 5) tube. The continuum model predicts that circumferential wave number n= 2 at buckling. Related with this, MD simulation shows that the cross-section of CNT is an ellipse at buckling. In particular, the nonlinear effects of vdW interaction have significant influence on the critical <b>buckling</b> <b>loading.</b> For the buckling under axial compression, two different kinds of buckling have been observed and investigated, namely the C-chain's unconditional buckling, and the tube's wall buckling, respectively. After the unconditional buckling, all displacements on the C-chain are in the same plane, and, the wave amplitudes' localization phenomenon appears. To the tube's wall buckling, the C-chain could either increase or decrease axial buckling strain depending on specific CNT chirality and temperature...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{involves}} {{the development of}} a fiberglass-foam composite sandwich structure with the introduction of delamination arrestment keys; therefore, a study of an initially delaminated composite sandwich structure was the experimental analysis on multiple configurations in how the arrestment keys are placed. The first part of this thesis research was to the experimental design and manufacturing of the composite sandwich plates. These plates were later cut down to the specific test dimensions and manufacturing processes for the composite sandwich plates and test specimens were created. The composite sandwich plates were manufactured using a vacuum resin infusion process. The dimensions of the composite layup are 14 inches in length with a width of 10. 75 inches. The width size has margin to account for machining. The actual dimensions of the test specimen after it is prepared are 14 inches by 0. 75 inches. The test anvil length is 11 inches and is used to perform tests to determine mechanical characteristics of the structures under <b>buckling</b> <b>loading.</b> These plates provide approximately 9 to 13 specimens per each case. All the test specimens have 4 plies of 18 oz fiberglass woven roving fabric from Jamestown Distributors, a LAST-A-FOAM FR- 6710 foam core, and 5 to 1 ratio of West Systems 105 / 206 epoxy. Also, a non-porous material was integrated into the structure to create an initial delamination in some of the case studies. The integration of the delamination arrestment keys involve milling the foam core to provide the necessary grooves for key placements before the structure is vacuumed and epoxy is flowed. The arrestment keys are made of unidirectional fiberglass strand and the West Systems 105 / 206 epoxy using a wet layup process. In addition, fiberglass woven roving specimens were created to see the material characteristics under compression and tensile loading. The same is created to determine the material properties of the foam core, wood boundary core, and arrestment keys under compression loading. The second part to this thesis investigation is the experimental testing of the test specimens with all different variables considered. Those variables includes determining the final solid cure duration of the fiberglass skin, the geometric lengths between pure compression and pure buckling, behaviors of different initial delamination size, effects of continuous and discontinuous arrestment keys parallel and perpendicular to the in-plane loading, and material properties. The final solid cure duration differ from what the manufacturer gave on their epoxy. This experiment testing followed ASTM D- 3039 standard to see the differences in elastic modulus over duration of 15 days. The resulting data shows that the test specimen fully cures after 13 to 14 days. The test specimens in search of the geometric buckling length for this investigation did not follow ASTM C- 364 standard in full, but follows a variation of the ASTM C- 364 standard in order to support <b>buckling</b> <b>loading</b> condition and the limited accessibility of the test equipments. Instead, the modifications are found with a different test jig design and test specimen configuration. The test jig was created to provide a pinned condition with a 0. 25 inch diameter. The test specimen is laid up with a foam and wood cores. Two wood cores are laid at each edge of the foam core to increase loading capacity and holes are drilled through the wood cores to create a pinned-pinned case for the optimum buckling condition. The results detailing the geometric buckling show that after 9 inches anvil length there is no compression; only buckling occurs with a cross-sectional dimension of 0. 75 inch by 0. 575 inch. The 11 inch foam length was chosen for convenience of machining. This modified setup was also used for testing the different configuration with the embedded arrestment keys. The multiple different configurations completed for these test specimens under unstable loading, the experiment results show that a continuous arrestment key embedded significantly improve the loading capacity over a perfectly sound non-delaminated specimen and maintain the majority of loading capacity even with an introduced delamination. The embedded continuous key also provided a higher horizontal displacement capability before fracture in comparison to the initially delaminated test specimens. As for the test specimens used to determine the material characteristics, ASTM D- 3410 and modified ASTM C- 364 standards were followed. The test specimens had a fiber volume fraction of approximately 0. 60, which details the brittle failure under tensile and compression loading. The results also show that the fibrous fiberglass test specimens have a higher ultimate strength in compression or buckling then in tension. All of the experimental testing was completed in the Aerospace Engineering Structural/Composite Lab at California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo, California. Therefore, an introduction of a continuous arrestment key parallel to the in-plane loading and embedded into the composite sandwich structure provided a significant increase in loading and buckling capabilities in comparison to the control test specimens with and without an initial delamination and no embedded key. The continuous key placed parallel to the load vector increased the structural strength with an increase of 126 % from a 1 -inch delaminated structures and only an 11 % drop from non-delaminated structures. That is, 1 -inch and 2 -inch delaminated structures showed a 61 % drop and 81 % drop from non-delaminated structures. Some configurations have reduced or arrested of the delaminated region...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{buckling}} instabilities occur when elastic solids are subject to compressive stresses. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of instabilities in systems subject to global tensile loads. Such tensile instabilities may be caused by certain discontinuities (geometrical or material) which re-distribute the stresses applied on its boundary, generating local compressive stresses inside the solid. This research deals with the tensile instabilities in elastic solids by using linear bifurcation analysis, which leads to eigenvalue problems. Then the links between mechanics and mathematics in these tensile instabilities/eigen-systems are demonstrated by using a combination of both numerical and asymptotic analyses. Three main problems have been investigated: a hybrid energy method on edge-buckling, the tensile wrinkling of a stretched bi-annular plate, and the tensile instabilities developed in a radially stretched thick cylindrical tube. We start by recording a coordinate-free derivation for Föppl–von Kármán equations and the corresponding bifurcation equations (both weak forms and strong forms with their boundary conditions) based on minimum energy principle. This set of equations is applicable to anisotropic elastic thin plates in any planar geometries, which is then specialised for the bifurcation problem of isotropic elastic plates, and a further case under in-plane loading. In the first main problem, we propose a hybrid energy method which provides an accurate and computationally efficient algorithm for the instability analysis of a class of edge-buckling problems. This algorithm is based on the existing simplest asymptotic approximations and an energy principle (weak form for bifurcation). Fairly accurate and robust approximations can be achieved for both the critical buckling load and mode number even though the simplest asymptotic ansatz is employed. We also explore a number of additional mathematical features that have an intrinsic interest in the context of multi-parameter eigenvalue problems. Then we consider the wrinkling instabilities of a stretched bi-annular plate, which consists of two fully bonded concentric annuli with different mechanical properties. The effects of the mechanical and geometrical parameters on critical wrinkling are studied, using both numerical and asymptotic techniques. It is found that the critical external <b>buckling</b> <b>loading,</b> the wrinkle numbers and the wrinkled-shape can behave completely differently compared with the single-annular case. The influence of discontinuities (the interface between these two annuli) on localised instabilities is also illustrated thoroughly. Finally, a WKB analysis is conducted which provides accurate approximations. In the third problem, we consider the bifurcation of an infinite thick cylindrical tube made of St. Venant–Kirchhoff elastic material, subject to radial tensile loading on both inner and outer walls. In particular, linear Lamé solutions in plane-strain are taken for the pre-bifurcation state, and the bifurcation equations are obtained by using Biot’s incremental bifurcation theory. The bifurcation of this plane-strain problem is completely different from the corresponding plane-stress case. Numerical investigations reveal two main bifurcation modes: a long-wave local deformation around the central hole of the domain, or a material wrinkling-type instability along the same boundary. Strictly speaking, the latter scenario is related to the violation of the Shapiro-Lopatinskij condition in an appropriate traction boundary-value problem. It is further shown that the main features of this material instability mode can be found by using a singular-perturbation strategy...|$|E

New <b>buckling</b> <b>load</b> equations are derived to properly predict tubular sinusoidal and helical buckling in such wellbores. The results show that the <b>buckling</b> <b>loads</b> to initiate sinusoidal and helical buckling of tubulars in curved wellbores are usually much larger than those in straight wellbores. This is because the curved wellbore tends to hold the axially compressed tubular against the outer-curve side of the wellbore. The tubular becomes less easy to buckle until higher axial compres-sive loads are applied. Less tubular lockup risk is then predicted for tubulars in horizontal or extended-reach wells by using the new <b>buckling</b> <b>load</b> equations. The new <b>buckling</b> <b>loads</b> in curved wellbores agree with those in straight wellbores when wellbore curvature approaches zero. Small-scale laboratory experiments also con-firmed these theoretically derived <b>buckling</b> <b>loads...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Buckling</b> <b>loads</b> {{for long}} {{isotropic}} and laminated cylinders are calculated based on Euler, Fluegge and Donnell's equations. Results from these methods are presented using simple parameters useful for fundamental design work. <b>Buckling</b> <b>loads</b> for {{two types of}} simply supported boundary conditions are calculated using finite element methods for comparison to select cases of the closed form solution. Results indicate that relying on Donnell theory can result in an over-prediction of <b>buckling</b> <b>loads</b> {{by as much as}} 40 % in isotropic materials...|$|R
40|$|Optimisation of {{thin-walled}} fibre composite {{cylindrical shell}} structures loaded by axial compression is considered, formulated as single objective problem with maximization of the <b>buckling</b> <b>load</b> only, and as multiobjective optimisation with maximization of the <b>buckling</b> <b>load</b> {{and at the}} same time minimization of imperfection sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|<b>Buckling</b> <b>loads</b> of thick-walled, orthotropic, simply-supported right {{circular}} cylinders are predicted {{using a new}} higher-order {{transverse shear}} deformation theory. The higher-order theory shows that, by more accurately accounting for transverse shear deformation effects, the predicted <b>buckling</b> <b>load</b> may be reduced {{by as much as}} 80 percent compared to predictions based on conventional transverse shear deformation theory. A parametric study of the effect of ply orientation on the <b>buckling</b> <b>load</b> of axially compressed cylinders indicates that laminates containing 0 deg plies are the most sensitive to transverse shear deformation effects. Interaction curves for buckling of cylinders with axial compressive and external pressure loadings indicate that <b>buckling</b> <b>loads</b> due to external pressure loadings are much less sensitive to transverse shear deformation effects than those due to axial compressive loadings...|$|R
40|$|After {{manufacturing}} a structure, {{the assembly}} of structural components is often not as perfect as expected due to the immaturity of current engineering techniques. Thus the actual <b>buckling</b> <b>load</b> for an element is sometimes not consistent with that predicted in the design. For design considerations, {{it is necessary to}} establish an analytical method for determining the <b>buckling</b> <b>load</b> experimentally. In this paper, a dynamic method is described for determining the linear <b>buckling</b> <b>loads</b> for elastic, perfectly flat plates. The proposed method does not require the application of in-plane loads and is feasible for arbitrary types of boundary conditions. It requires only the vibrational excitation of the plate. The <b>buckling</b> <b>load</b> is determined from the measured natural frequencies and vibration mode shapes...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to improve {{structural}} design of corrugated board packages under compression <b>load,</b> <b>buckling</b> analysis of simply-supported corrugated board panels, which constitute the main load-bearing components of a compression loaded box, has been performed. This paper focuses on prediction of effective (homogenised) properties of the corrugated core and the critical <b>buckling</b> <b>load</b> of a simply-supported board panel. An improved <b>buckling</b> <b>load</b> prediction has been obtained by incorporation of the additional moments produced by transverse shear deformation in the governing differential equation for equilibrium. The <b>buckling</b> <b>load</b> predictions are compared to previous analytical formulations, finite element analysis and experiments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract An {{algorithm}} {{based on}} Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) formulation is proposed for optimum design for specified linear <b>buckling</b> <b>load</b> factor. Optimal trusses and frames are computed {{by using the}} primal-dual interior-point method for SDP. It {{is well known that}} optimizing structures under buckling constraints is difficult because of nondifferentiability of the <b>buckling</b> <b>load</b> factors for the case of multimodal solutions. It is shown, in the examples, that optimum designs with multiple <b>buckling</b> <b>load</b> factors can be found without any difficulty by successively solving SDP problems...|$|R
