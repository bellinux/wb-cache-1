30|$|By {{analyzing}} {{the dimension of}} power in the intergenerational parenting coalition, this study further elucidates the tendency toward an inversion in the power hierarchy between the parent and their adult children in intergenerational collaborations. To some extent, the inversion is associated {{with the fact that the}} adult children have a higher socioeconomic status than their parents. However, the formation, development, and modification of the power pattern in the intergenerational parenting coalition largely depend on the cultivation of intimate bonds by both the parents and their adult children.

Here we formulate two important refinements to the explanation of bond energetics. First, energy surface calculations in the elastic filament approximation reveal a finite stabilizing barrier assumed a simple Lennard-Jones-like potential for protein bonds. The presence of a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) cap represented by straight segments is necessary, as it is predicted for a long time. In the lack of such a cap, the protofilaments are either in an absolutely stable or absolutely unstable state. Second, our calculations show that this barrier appears only if the mechanical energy associated with the conformational change after GTP hydrolysis (curling energy) {{is larger than the}} strength of lateral bonds. The overall energy balance we propose supports continuous assembly of GTP dimers, a metastable state {{in the presence of a}} finite GTP cap and energetically driven disassembly of guanosine diphosphate protofilaments...|$|R

40|$|The {{misalignment}} between {{corporate bond}} and {{credit default swap}} (CDS) spreads (i. e., CDSbond basis) during the 2007 - 09 financial crisis is often attributed to corporate <b>bond</b> dealers <b>shedding</b> off their inventory, right when liquidity was scarce.

Corporate bond inventory of dealers rose sharply as a result. Although providing liquidity, limits to arbitrage, possibly in the form of limited capital, obstructed the convergence of the basis. We further show that the unwinding of precrisis 'basis trades' by hedge funds is the main driver of the large negative basis. Price drops following Lehman's collapse were concentrated among bonds with available CDS contracts and high activity in basis trades.

Homosexual behavior involving females is poorly researched in most primate taxa, exceptions being Japanese macaques, rhesus macaques, Hanuman langurs and bonobos. We present data on homosexual behavior in female mountain gorillas in the Virunga Volcanoes (Rwanda) and test four functional hypotheses, namely reconciliation, affiliation, dominance expression and sexual arousal. Homosexual interactions between females involved both ventro-dorsal and ventro-ventral copulations accompanied by vocalizations and courtship displays. The only sociosexual hypothesis that received partial empirical support is the social status hypothesis, i. e., that mounting reaffirms the dominance hierarchy. There is also some limited evidence that same-sex behavior reflects an overall state of arousal or is triggered via a 'pornographic' effect. An adaptive function of female homosexual behavior is not readily apparent, and we tentatively conclude (until a more rigorous test becomes available) that it may simply be related to sexual gratification or {{that it is an}} evolutionary by-product of an adaptation...|$|R

40|$|Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) is {{the only}} {{mammalian}} homologue of the well-characterised angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE). ACE 2 shares 40 % identity and 60 % similarity in overall protein sequence with ACE. Like ACE, ACE 2 is a type I integral membrane protein and a zinc dependent metalloprotease. ACE 2 has recently been shown to undergo a proteolytic cleavage event, releasing an active soluble ectodomain. This cleavage-event is also commonly known as ectodomain shedding. The studies outlined in this thesis were designed to characterise the regulation of ACE 2 ectodomain shedding, specifically looking at the interaction of this carboxypeptidase with calmodulin, potential site of cleavage mediated by tumour necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (also known as TACE or ADAM 17), {{as well as the}} mechanism(s) responsible for the activation of this cleavage event. Calmodulin gel shift assays have showed that this calcium regulatory protein is able to bind to both peptides that mimic the cytoplasmic tail of ACE 2. Furthermore, we showed that GST-calmodulin fusion proteins were successfully co-immunoprecipitated along with full-length ACE 2, in vitro. By using increasing concentrations of the calmodulin specific inhibitor, trifluoroperazine and calmidazolium, we have observed increase in the shedding activity of ACE 2 endogenously expressed in Huh- 7 cells (n≥ 3, one-way ANOVA, P < 0. 05). We also provided evidence that calmodulin-induced shedding of ACE 2 in the Huh- 7 cells were non-responsive to protein kinase C inhibitor, suggesting that the activation pathway for this shedding mechanism differs from that mediated by phorbol esters. To characterise the cleavage-secretion site for ACE 2 ectodomain release, peptide mimetics of ACE 2 juxtamembrane region were incubated with purified recombinant TACE for analysis by MALDI-TOF/TOF. Peptide fragment analysis showed that ADAM 17 cleaves peptide mimetics between Arg 708 – Ser 709 <b>bond.</b> <b>Shedding</b> profiles of an ACE 2 mutant in CHO-K 1 and Huh- 7 cells were carried out, indicating that Arg 708 → Glu 708 and double mutant Arg 708 /Arg 710 → Glu 708 /Glu 710 displayed increased shedding activity when stimulated by phorbol ester. Lastly, to explore the possibility that the phorbol ester (PMA) stimulated shedding could be a consequence of a G-protein coupled receptor activation, Huh- 7 cells and HEK 293 cells expressing the AT 1 R receptor were transfected with ACE 2 and treated with angiotensin peptides (angiotensin I and angiotensin II) in the presence of different angiotensin receptor antagonists. At various time points of angiotensin treatment, significant increases were observed in ACE 2 shedding in cells treated with either angiotensin I or angiotensin II peptides. However when Huh- 7 cells were incubated with the metabolically stable AT 1 receptor agonist, L- 162, 313, we observed significant changes in cell morphology, suggesting the likeliness of cell death, and were also reflected in the gradual decrease in ACE 2 activity detected in the medium. In summary these studies have provided strong evidence suggesting the involvement of calmodulin in regulating the ectodomain shedding of ACE 2, an event which is independent of protein kinase C signaling pathway. We also propose that ADAM 17 is able to cleave ACE 2 between Arg 708 – Ser 709, and that AT 1 R receptor activation may lead to stimulation of ectodomain shedding in ACE 2. Given that ACE 2 has recently been shown to be the functional receptor for the severe-acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and also its implications in cardiovascular, renal and respiratory regulations, these studies add to our knowledge of how the ectodomain shedding of this important membrane protein may be actually regulated...|$|R

It is common for bereaved persons to experience some forms of ongoing connections with deceased family members. Yet the phenomenon was not very well understood in the field, especially in the Chinese contexts. There was an emerging need to develop a standardized measure on continuing bond experience, while expanding cultural perspective on understanding continuing bond experience. This thesis aims to address the above research gaps, to construct and develop a Chinese continuing bond measure and explores its factor structures and psychometric properties among Chinese bereaved persons in Hong Kong. The research adopted a mixed method approach comprising of two parts. The first part is a qualitative study conducted with eight bereaved persons and two professional staff working in death related industry. Twenty-eight continuing bond experiences were identified and a Chinese continuing bond measure was constructed. A three-factor conceptual structure, with continuing bond experiences categorized into experiencing in five senses, reflecting in mind and attitude and expressing through actions, were proposed for further analyses. The second part is a quantitative study investigating the empirical structure of the Chinese continuing bond measure and psychometric properties of Chinese continuing bond measure. The prevalence of various continuing bond experiences among Chinese bereaved person has ranged from 6. 7 % to 83. 7 %, with an overall prevalence of 96. 6 %. Factor analysis revealed a seven-factor empirical structure of Chinese continuing bond consists of universal bond, sensory bond, Confucian legacy, bond built on ashes, Taoist rituals, deceased in daily life and collective bond.

Stay-in-place formed concrete is becoming a popular building technique, as this technology has exhibited outstanding results in blast resistant applications, containing the fragmented concrete and preventing it from entering a building and endangering those within. A test {{has been designed to}} determine the effects of cold joints in walls of this type, as there will undoubtedly be interruptions of a pour. A solution commonly used in the field to alleviate the effects of cold joints in structural concrete involves applying a bonding agent between the hardened concrete and the fresh. The test was developed using ASTM standards C 78 and C 1042 as guides, to accurately predict the behavior of wall sections containing cold joints when exposed to pure moment. The basic test design is to submit a sample to bending to determine its moment capacity and maximum deflection, inducing an equal moment within the loading span. While the test is in progress, mid-span deflection will be recorded at incremental loadings, noting the maximum deflection and load as the section fails. Cold joints within samples will be located center span, in the region where uniform moment will be induced. This should force the break to the center, to the joint in question. The results from samples with the <b>bonding</b> agent should <b>shed</b> some light on the overall applicability of a bonding agent.

40|$|High cell-surface GnRH {{receptor}} (GnRH-R) {{levels have}} been shown to have a major influence on the extent of GnRH agonist-mediated tumor growth inhibition. The ability of the GnRH agonist leuprorelin acetate (LA) to induce a post-transcriptional upregulation of GnRH-R at the plasma membrane of androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and -insensitive (PC- 3) prostate cancer (PCa) cells has been previously demonstrated by Western blotting. Here we performed single molecule force spectroscopy by using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), which {{has proven to be a}} powerful tool allowing for investigation of living cell surface biological features, such as the so far unclear GnRH agonist/receptor interaction. Thus, in the hormone-insensitive PC- 3 cells, we characterized the strength of the LA-receptor binding, and the amount and distribution of the functional receptor molecules on the cell surface. The effect of a long and continuous treatment (up to 30 days) with the agonist (10 - 11 and 10 - 6 M) on the same parameters was also investigated. A GnRH-R increase was observed, reaching the maximum (~ 80 %) after 30 days of treatment with the highest dose of LA (10 - 6 M). The analogue-induced increase in GnRH-R was also demonstrated by Western blotting. In addition, two different receptor bound strengths were detected by AFM, which suggests the existence of two GnRH-R classes. A homogeneous distribution of the unbinding events has been found on untreated and treated PC- 3 cell surfaces. The persistence of high receptor levels at the membrane of these living cells may warrant the maintenance of the response to LA also in androgen-unresponsive PCa.

40|$|Privatization’s proponents are {{branching}} out.   They’ve traditionally {{relied on}} government contracting to boost regulatory efficiency, maximize budgetary savings, enhance unitary {{control over the}} administrative state, and reap political dividends.   Now, however, these proponents are also blazing newer, bolder paths.   They’re experimenting with more powerful instruments that offer surer, quicker routes to promote privatization’s aims.   One such instrument is marketized bureaucracy.   For decades, the government offered its employees generous base compensation and considerable job security.   During that time, privatization’s proponents found these public-sector arrangements anathema.   Rather than tear down the then-prized civil-service framework, they simply circumvented it — replacing what they viewed as overpaid and insufficiently motivated government workers with contractors.   Of late, however, the tide has turned against the civil service.   Across the country, elected officials are reducing government workers’ wages and benefits, curtailing collective-bargaining rights, reclassifying tenured civil servants as at-will employees, and introducing performance-based bonuses.   These efforts have made government bureaucracy far more like the private sector, thus reducing the need to contract out.   Another such instrument is government by bounty.   Exemplified by regulatory vouchers, prediction markets, R&D prizes, and social-impact <b>bonds,</b> government-by-bounty initiatives <b>shed</b> the conventional contractual form.   In its stead are high-risk, high-reward bets that shift financial and programmatic responsibility onto bounty seekers.   Unlike traditional contractors, bounty seekers invest their own money and get paid only if they win the "bet" — that is, only if they successfully carry out their given tasks.   As a result, the bounty seekers are, in theory, better-motivated and less susceptible to slack, abuse, and fraud. This Article explores how these instruments uniquely challenge the administrative state, reorienting public programs, reversing longstanding practices, and forcing courts to recalibrate core administrative law doctrines in ways traditional contracting never did.   Specifically, these new instruments enable school districts to “teach to the test,” states to barter away sovereign authority, and presidents to politicize the bureaucracy.   They also test the robustness of foundational legal precepts undergirding hard-look review, Chevron and Skidmore deference, and constitutional due process.   Ultimately, the emergence of these instruments reflects {{the extent to which}} government today is commingling political and business-like agendas in ways both liberating and threatening...|$|R
