5|$|In January 1976, California's {{study of}} the {{economic}} impact of its law repealing prohibitions of use went into effect. The law reduced the penalty for personal possession of an ounce or less of marijuana from a felony to a citable misdemeanor with a maximum fine of $100. Possession of more than an ounce was made a misdemeanor, making the maximum fine $500 and/or six months in jail. After the law went into effect, the state's annual spending towards marijuana laws went down 74%. Prior to the law, the state had <b>been</b> <b>spending</b> from $35 million to $100 million.|$|E
5|$|Crowley left Busch and {{returned}} to London, where he took Pearl Brooksmith as his new Scarlet Woman. Undergoing further nasal surgery, it was here in 1932 that {{he was invited to}} be guest of honour at Foyles' Literary Luncheon, also being invited by Harry Price to speak at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research. In need of money, he launched a series of court cases against people whom he believed had libelled him, some of which proved successful. He gained much publicity for his lawsuit against Constable and Co for publishing Nina Hamnett's Laughing Torso (1932) – a book he thought libelled him – but lost the case. The court case added to Crowley's financial problems, and in February 1935 he was declared bankrupt. During the hearing, it was revealed that Crowley had <b>been</b> <b>spending</b> three times his income for several years.|$|E
5|$|A patient, Jillian Miller (Jessica Stroup), is {{admitted}} in obstetrics and gynaecology, and is revealed {{to suffer from}} advanced cervical cancer, which leads to her contacting her parents, from whom she ran away from years ago, along with her best friend Rachel Meyer (Rachel Boston). Stevens quickly becomes emotionally involved in the patient's situation and encourages her to return home, after learning that the two girls were Amish, shunned from their natal village. Torres and Yang operate on a runner who {{is admitted}} in orthopedics, coping {{with the news that}} he {{will never be able to}} compete in races after the extensive surgical procedure. Sloan announces his plans of returning to New York City, but abruptly decides to stay in Seattle, following Grey accidentally revealing Webber's retirement plans. Shepherd is displeased with Sloan's decision, which results in an argument between him and Grey, which threatens putting damage on their relationship. Webber returns to his wife, Adele (Loretta Devine), seeking forgiveness, but is left devastated at the realization that she has <b>been</b> <b>spending</b> the night with another man. Bailey ultimately finds support in Stevens, who proves enthusiastic to spend her entire US$8 million inheritance, for the opening of the free clinic. At the conclusion of the episode, Yang confides in Burke, who unexpectedly proposes to her, whereas O'Malley, who finally admits how affected he was by the death of his father, proposes to Torres.|$|E

His unintelligent friend Hazel (a man) comes in to chat with him ("All Kinds of People"). Millicent, a wealthy young lady, enters from the next room, where she has <b>been</b> <b>spending</b> (part of) the night with Doc. Mac, another friend of Doc, brings in Suzy, who has injured her hand breaking a window to steal some donuts. Doc, whose lack of a medical degree does not stop the denizens of Cannery Row from seeking him out for treatment, bandages her hand, as the irritated Millicent leaves. Suzy, new in town, is curious about Doc's work ("The Tide Pool") and tells about her journey from San Francisco ("Everybody's Got a Home but Me"). Fauna, who runs the nearby Bear Flag Café—an establishment open even at this hour—had heard that a new girl in town had injured herself, and has come to talk to Suzy. Fauna is initially reluctant to invite Suzy into the Bear Flag, but when Jim, the local plainclothes cop gives Suzy a hard time, Fauna takes Suzy in.

5000|$|For example, Paul Krugman {{wrote in}} December 2010 that significant, {{sustained}} government <b>spending</b> <b>was</b> necessary because indebted households were paying down debts {{and unable to}} carry the U.S. economy as they had previously: [...] "The root of our current troubles lies in the debt American families ran up during the Bush-era housing bubble...highly indebted Americans not only can’t spend {{the way they used}} to, they’re having to pay down the debts they ran up in the bubble years.

25|$|If a male {{does not}} {{successfully}} prevent an intrasexual rivals' attempt at mating, {{there are many}} risks. If the female becomes fertilised, then the male loses the opportunity to reproduce with that partner {{for an extended period}} of time and his genes will not be passed on to the offspring. Moreover, the male may invest years of time, resources and energy into a child that is not genetically his own. If this becomes public knowledge, the individual may also face public humiliation, and as a result this could reduce his social status and affect his future chances to reproduce. There are also ‘opportunity costs’; wherein the male could have <b>been</b> <b>spending</b> lost time pursuing alternative mating options.|$|E
25|$|To expand coverage, the Government of Peru has <b>been</b> <b>spending</b> {{an average}} of US$40–50 million {{per year in the}} last ten years for electrification.

The DEP, which is currently in the process of being absorbed by the National Rural Electrification Office (DGER), is in charge of planning, designing and constructing the rural electricity systems. Once they are finalized, the rural electricity systems are handed over for operation either to state-owned distribution companies or to a specially created state-owned asset-holding company that manages the systems under operation contracts with state-owned companies, or municipalities.|$|E
25|$|While the {{compromise}} {{was a success}} for the residents of Wheatley Hills, according to Robert Caro in The Power Broker, the $175,000 was a smokescreen {{for the fact that}} the land purchasing would cost $2.25million (1929USD) and rather than the locals, the taxpayers would be stuck with the majority (over 90%) of the bill from the acquisition. The $175,000 also was claimed by Moses to have <b>been</b> <b>spending</b> for the entire cost of the detour, rather than the land acquisition. Caro goes on to explain that the accommodations made for the citizens of Wheatley Hills denied Long Islanders some of the parks on the North Shore that had been proposed by Moses, pardoning Caumsett State Park. Caro also explained that along with the $10,000 bribe that Moses had accepted, the illegal purchases of the Taylor Estate would turn him into a beating stick for the politicians of New York to get him to stop fighting.|$|E

[...] He further praised the [...] "catchy-as-cholera" [...] chorus and gave a mixed review about the lyrics and the title saying [...] "fortunately their words {{seemed to have been}} a touch overzealous; though it's clear from the trailer for the group's third album that they've <b>been</b> <b>spending</b> a night or two on the tiles."

Entertainment Weeklys Kyle Anderson also chose it as a highlight, further describing it as [...] "fierce". Los Angeles Times Mikael Wood wrote that [...] "'What You Want' rides its central riff with a bulldozer's efficiency." [...] Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe found a [...] "metallic lurch playing off of Lee's goth-empress vocals" [...] in the song.

500|$|Dismayed by {{the rate}} at which the team had <b>been</b> <b>spending</b> money for a year without results, Okamoto asked Miyamoto for help, who then came up with the idea of a whole trilogy of games, each with a {{different}} focus on gameplay elements. This trilogy was referred to as the [...] "Triforce Series", named after a fictional holy relic known as the Triforce that plays a major role in many Zelda titles. The Triforce is composed of three parts: the Triforces of Power, Wisdom, and Courage; each game in the trilogy was to be associated with a piece of the Triforce, one of the titles being the conversion of the original The Legend of Zelda. The first game of the three was demonstrated at Nintendo's SpaceWorld trade show in 1999, under the working title Zelda no Densetsu: Fushigi no Kinomi – Chikara no Shō (ゼルダの伝説 ふしぎの木の実 ～力の章～). This action-oriented game concerned Ganon's theft of Princess Zelda and the [...] "Rod of the Seasons", which threw the seasons of Hyrule into chaos—a precursor to the plot of Oracle of Seasons. In the playable demonstration, Link solved puzzles by using the Rod of the Seasons to manipulate the environment and change the current season. Chie no Shō, which focused on color-based puzzles, and Yūki no Shō, which used the times of day to solve puzzles in a mechanic similar to the use of seasons, were not shown. In the US, the games became The Legend of Zelda: Mystical Seed of Power, Mystical Seed of Wisdom, and Mystical Seed of Courage.|$|E
