5|$|After {{weakening}} to a Category1 hurricane on September30, the National Hurricane Center {{noted that}} very cold cloud tops still existed, though IR imagery {{indicated that the}} convection and circulation associated with the storm was becoming asymmetrical. Isaac remained a Category1 hurricane for almost 24hours, at which time the storm began to accelerate east-northeastward. Early on October1, the National Hurricane Center noted that minimal deep convection persisted near the center {{and much of it}} was displaced to the north. Mid-level dry air and low-level cold air began entering the western quadrant of the storm, which caused it to begin its extratropical transition. By 0600UTC on October1, Isaac weakened to a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center noted that further weakening would <b>be</b> <b>slow,</b> due to the large wind field associated with the storm. At 1500UTC on October1, the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on the storm; Isaac fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about three hours later, while located about halfway between Newfoundland and the Azores. The extratropical remnants tracked rapidly east-northeastward and affected the British Isles on October3 and October4, eventually merging with another extratropical low while north of Scotland early on October4.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{use their}} baleen plates to sieve plankton, among others, {{out of the}} water; {{there are two types}} of methods: lunge-feeding and gulp-feeding. Lunge-feeders expand the volume of their jaw to a volume bigger than the {{original}} volume of the whale itself by inflating their mouth. This causes grooves on their throat to expand, increasing the amount of water the mouth can store. They ram a baitball at high speeds in order to feed, but this is only energy-effective when used against a large baitball. Gulp-feeders swim with an open mouth, filling it with water and prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be within a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it, and <b>be</b> <b>slow</b> enough so that it cannot escape.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, a monsoon trough located {{west of the}} Northern Mariana Islands {{produced}} two tropical disturbances. The first of these tracked due west and later became Tropical Storm Irving. The second of these disturbances remained poorly organized and development into a tropical cyclone was expected to <b>be</b> <b>slow.</b> By July21, an {{area of low pressure}} formed within the system and convection associated with it increased. Situated underneath an anticyclone, upper-level outflow also improved. Following further organization of the system, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 11W on July21; at this time, the depression was located about 555km (345mi) west of Guam. Further aided by a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northwest, the depression intensified into a tropical storm on July23 and was assigned the name Judy by the JTWC.|$|E

5|$|On August10, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} a westward moving tropical wave emerging off {{the west}} coast of Africa, centered along 16°W. Accompanied by disorganized convective activity, development, if any, was expected to <b>be</b> <b>slow.</b> A broad area of low pressure subsequently formed within the wave about halfway between Africa and the Cape Verde Islands. Embedded within an elongated trough, the weak system struggled to organize and convection soon diminished. Interaction with a monsoon trough reinvigorated shower and thunderstorm activity on August11 across a large area southwest of the Cape Verde Islands, but the surface low had dissipated by this time. Development was no longer expected over the following days as dry air created a hostile area for storm organization. The wave continued westward across the Atlantic and entered the Caribbean Sea on August16. Subsequent interactions with South America and an upper-level trough inhibited improvement of the system.|$|E
5|$|The General Aircraft Limited GAL. 49 Hamilcar or Hamilcar Mark I {{was a large}} British {{military}} glider {{produced during}} the Second World War, {{which was designed to}} carry heavy cargo, such as the Tetrarch or M22 Locust light tank. When the British airborne establishment was formed in 1940 by the order of Prime Minister Winston Churchill it was decided to develop a large glider which would be able to transport heavy equipment in support of airborne troops. General Aircraft Limited were chosen in January 1941 to develop this glider, which they designated the GAL. 49 'Hamilcar'. It was designed to transport a single light tank or two Universal Carriers. A number of problems, which included vacillation by the War Office on the number of gliders that it wanted and poor management by GAL, led to delays in the production of the Hamilcar, and the first production glider was only assembled in mid-1943. These problems were only partially solved, and production of the glider continued to <b>be</b> <b>slow,</b> hampered by difficulties in finding suitable locations to store and construct the Hamilcars once their parts were produced. A total of 344 Hamilcars had been built when production ended in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} to Hurricane Celia was first identified on June5, 2010 by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) as a disorganized area of disturbed weather {{associated with a}} tropical wave off the western coast of Africa in the Atlantic Ocean. Tracking westward, little development took place and the system eventually crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on June17. Situated several hundred miles south-southeast of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, the disturbance moved slowly towards the west-northwest and little development was expected to occur. By June18, scatterometer data of the system indicated that a surface circulation had developed and the system's overall structure had become increasingly organized. Later that day, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued for the system as it was now anticipated to become a tropical cyclone within 48hours. At this time, convective banding features had begun wrapping around the system; however, it lacked deep, central cloud cover. Further development was expected to <b>be</b> <b>slow</b> due to moderate wind shear {{in the region of}} the low. Around 1800UTC, the system had become sufficiently organized for the NHC to designate it as a tropical depression. At this time, the depression was situated roughly 370mi (595km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Operationally, the depression was not warned upon until early the next morning.|$|E
