5|$|Thirdly, the teleological {{explanation}} of adaptation is uncomfortable {{because it seems}} to require backward causation, in which existing traits are explained by future outcomes; {{because it seems to}} attribute the action of a conscious mind when none is assumed to be present in an organism; and <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result, adaptation looks impossible to test empirically.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{hearing the}} news of the change of government, former viceroy Santiago de Liniers {{prepared}} a counter-revolution from the city of Córdoba, but Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo routed his militia and captured all the leaders {{in just a couple of}} skirmishes. The initial orders were to send them to Buenos Aires, but after their capture the Junta decided to execute them. This decision was taken in a resolution signed by all members of the Junta, excepting Manuel Alberti, <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> priest, he could not give consent to the death penalty. The measure found strong popular resistance in Córdoba, as Liniers and the governor Juan Gutierrez de la Concha were popular and the execution of a priest (Rodrigo de Orellana, another leader of the counter-revolution) was rejected as heretical. Ocampo and Chiclana decided to carry on with the original orders, and transferred the prisoners to Buenos Aires.|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of movable type in Europe, chroniclers could reach a wider audience and begin to write about Swiss history as a whole. The 1507 Chronicle of the Swiss Confederation by Petermann Etterlin exerted great influence on later writers <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> printed work, {{it was the first}} to be generally available.|$|E
5000|$|This {{causes the}} Fort Ancient {{designation}} to be problematic, <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> unreal entity, the so-called culture has no clear descendants.|$|R
5000|$|Luis Emilio Recabarren, Chilean communist, was {{prevented}} from assuming his position <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> atheist, {{he refused to}} be sworn in on a Bible.|$|R
50|$|The NLRB {{dismissed}} their {{petition for}} lack of required evidence. It also denied the BLET the right to add proof of conferencing to the complaint <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> appellate body it is not permitted to receive new evidence.|$|R
25|$|In The Trial of Socrates (1988), I. F. Stone {{said that}} Socrates {{wanted to be}} sentenced to death, {{in order to justify}} his philosophic {{opposition}} to the Athenian democracy of that time, and <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> man, he saw that old age would be an unpleasant time for him.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{supplements}} of nitric oxide, {{the response is}} short-lived <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> normally produced internal physiologic control mechanism, increased concentrations lead to increased rates of clearance, which {{is the reason that}} the effectiveness of sustained use of nitroglycerin for vasodilation fades to none after hours to days.|$|E
25|$|The South Carolina Working Families Party {{had also}} {{nominated}} Michael Cone. South Carolina's election law allows for electoral fusion. This {{was the first}} time the party had nominated a candidate for statewide office. However, Cone was not listed on the ballot <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> loser of the Democratic primary, Cone was disqualified under the state's sore loser law.|$|E
25|$|In April 2006, Chee {{was stopped}} at the airport as he was {{preparing}} to board a flight to Istanbul <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> undischarged bankrupt, he could not leave Singapore without official approval of the Official Assignee, which he had not obtained.|$|R
50|$|Lyons {{has been}} known to make ethnically {{insensitive}} comments on multiple occasions; for example, implying that it was okay if a Japanese journalist's camera was smashed by Hideki Irabu, <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Asian journalist, he must have half a dozen spares.|$|R
6000|$|If not, why, {{in a whole}} {{company of}} actors, should [...] "Shake-scene" [...] alone be {{selected}} for a special victim? Shake-scene is chosen out <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> author, a factotum always ready at need, he is more apt than the professed playwrights to be employed as author by his company: {{this is a new}} reason for not trusting the players.|$|R
25|$|The Robert {{brothers}} were skilled engineers with a workshop at the Place des Victoires in Paris, {{who worked with}} professor Jacques Charles to build the first usable hydrogen balloon in 1783. Charles conceived the idea that hydrogen would be a suitable lifting agent for balloons <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> chemist, he had studied {{the work of his}} contemporaries Henry Cavendish, Joseph Black and Tiberius Cavallo.|$|E
25|$|Valantasis {{and other}} {{scholars}} {{argue that it is}} difficult to date Thomas <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> collection of logia without a narrative framework, individual sayings could have been added to it gradually over time. Valantasis dates Thomas to 100 – 110 AD, with some of the material certainly coming from the first stratum which is dated to 30 – 60 AD. J. R. Porter dates the Gospel of Thomas much later, to 250 AD.|$|E
25|$|As a child, he {{ran away}} from his nanny and fell into an {{irrigation}} channel and injured his eyes. Fearing that his son might lose his sight completely, his father moved the family to Castellón de la Plana to attend music classes <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> musician {{he would be able}} to earn a living, even if blind. Both his first music teachers, Eugeni Ruiz and Manuel González, were blind.|$|E
2500|$|Note {{that the}} PDF at the {{previous}} timestep is inductively {{assumed to be}} the estimated state and covariance. This is justified <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> optimal estimator, the Kalman filter makes best use of the measurements, therefore the PDF for [...] given the measurements [...] is the Kalman filter estimate.|$|R
50|$|Philipps {{was born}} in Oak Park, Illinois. Her parents gave her the {{nickname}} Busy <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> infant she was always moving.

She attended Loyola Marymount University {{at the same time}} as Freaks and Geeks costar Linda Cardellini and former boyfriend Colin Hanks.|$|R
5000|$|Pier Paolo Pasolini {{said that}} he wasn't able to rebirth Anna Magnani as she was in Roma, città aperta <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> actor, she chose to {{maintain}} her independence from his artistic visions.

25|$|Broad beans {{have a long}} {{tradition}} of cultivation in Old World agriculture, being among the most ancient plants in cultivation and also among the easiest to grow. Along with lentils, peas, and chickpeas, they are believed to have become part of the eastern Mediterranean diet around 6000 BC or earlier. They are still often grown as a cover crop to prevent erosion, because they can overwinter and <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> legume, they fix nitrogen in the soil.|$|E
25|$|Between 1880 and 1882 Wilson {{made several}} {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts to get}} into the British Army officer-training establishments, two to enter the Royal Military Academy (Woolwich) and three for the Royal Military College (although there were nine applicants for every place in the late 1870s). The entrance examinations to both relied heavily on rote learning. Sir John Fortescue later (in 1927) claimed that this was <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tall boy he needed “time for his brain to develop”.|$|E
25|$|The mutineers on {{the various}} vessels {{involved}} found Grampus particularly useful <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> storeship, stocked for a voyage, {{she was able to}} provide them with supplies. Still, after the reading of the proclamation the mutiny collapsed and by mid-June Grampus had returned to Royal Navy control. After the end of the mutiny, five men from Grampus were sentenced to death. Another account reports that three men were condemned to death and two were confined to solitary cells. Grampus then sailed for Jamaica in August.|$|E
50|$|HMS Pallas was a {{purpose-built}} wooden-hulled ironclad of the Royal Navy, designed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> private venture by Sir Edward Reed, {{and accepted}} by the Board of Admiralty <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> economy measure, they wished to use up the stocks of seasoned timber held in the Woolwich Dockyard. The fact that Woolwich was not equipped to build iron ships was also relevant.|$|R
25|$|On April 25, 2007, Durbin {{said that}} <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{intelligence}} committee member he knew in 2002 from classified {{information that the}} American people were being misled by the Bush Administration into a war on Iraq, {{but he could not}} reveal this <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> intelligence committee member, he was sworn to secrecy. This revelation prompted an online attack ad against Durbin by the National Republican Senatorial Committee.|$|R
50|$|Several Muslim traditions recount {{meetings}} between the Angel of Death and the prophets, {{the most famous}} being a conversation between the Angel of Death and Moses.In an islamic narration, Idris befriended the angel of death. Idris offered him food, thereupon he revealed him his non-human essence, <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> angel, he does not eat. Later the angel of death showed him the heavens.|$|R
25|$|However, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that this theological objection plays any role in the non-inclusion of Good Friday as a holiday. On the contrary, Good Friday is probably not a public holiday <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole in the federation, Christians constitutes 9.2% of the population according to the 2010 Census. The other two significant religious minorities in Malaysia, Buddhists and Hindus, also receive just one federal public holiday each – Wesak Day and Deepavali respectively. Deepavali however, is not federal holiday in the state of Sarawak.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{requirement}} for the retirement of a UT student-athlete's number is that the individual have won a widely recognized National Player of the Year award. Former UT Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds stated that an exception {{was made in the}} case of Slater Martin <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, he was a legend in the sport of basketball but had competed before any of the widely recognized awards were established (the Sporting News Men's College Basketball Player of the Year was established in 1943, but it was not awarded from 1947 to 1949).|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicle is}} {{designed}} to have standard features such as AC/Heat (manufactured by RedDOT), AM/FM stereo, power windows/door lock, cruise control, three airbags, a reinforced steel roll cage, side intrusion beams, stability control, and disc brakes with ABS. Continental AG has created a tire specifically for the Elio. The Elio designs meet motorcycle standards <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> three-wheeler, it is within the U.S. government's motorcycle classification. The company has lobbied in most states, to alter regulations that would otherwise require drivers to wear a helmet and, in many states to remove the requirement for operators to have a motorcycle endorsement on their driver license.|$|E
50|$|At a {{very early}} period he came to be {{confused}} with the Philip the Apostle; the confusion was all the more easy <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> esteemed member of the apostolic company, he may readily have been described <b>as</b> <b>an</b> apostle in the wider sense of that word, beyond the original 12 Apostles. A late tradition describes him as settling at Tralles in Anatolia, where he became the bishop of that church.|$|R
5000|$|The Final Incal {{is kind of}} a {{call for}} revolt to {{organize}} life in <b>a</b> different way, <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> individual the people are mortal but as humanity itself they are immortal. To learn that others exist, to live together and give, that there is continuity only as part of humanity <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole. It demonstrates that [...] "love is the ultimate purifier; a force that can cleanse, renew and revitalize".|$|R
50|$|Biological {{control is}} {{preferable}} over herbicide use on lawns, as crabgrass emergence {{is not the}} cause of poor lawn health but a symptom, and it will return annually if the lawn is not restored with fertilization and proper watering. Crabgrass is quickly outcompeted by healthy lawn grass <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> annual plant, crabgrass dies off in autumn and needs open conditions for its germination the following spring.|$|R
25|$|There is no {{appointed}} or elected Sheriff in the District of Columbia <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Federal City, {{it is in}} {{a unique}} and complicated position compared to other jurisdictions in the United States. As the District Government is both an agency of the Federal Government and a duly-elected Local Government under the D.C. Home Rule Act of 1973, there are many functions which would normally be reserved for the Office of the Sheriff, which are instead delegated to various other agencies. The United States Marshal Service, as an agent of the Federal Government officially handles most court and civil processes in the District of Columbia, while the District of Columbia Protective Services Police Department (PSPD) handles many other functions normally reserved for the Office of the Sheriff on behalf of the elected local government.|$|E
25|$|Obsidian is mineral-like, {{but not a}} true mineral <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> glass it is not crystalline; in addition, its {{composition}} is too variable to be classified as a mineral. It is sometimes classified as a mineraloid. Though obsidian is usually dark in color similar to mafic rocks such as basalt, obsidian's {{composition is}} extremely felsic. Obsidian consists mainly of SiO2 (silicon dioxide), usually 70% or more. Crystalline rocks with obsidian's composition include granite and rhyolite. Because obsidian is metastable at the Earth's surface (over time the glass becomes fine-grained mineral crystals), no obsidian {{has been found that}} is older than Cretaceous age. This breakdown of obsidian is accelerated by the presence of water. Having a low water content when newly formed, typically less than 1% water by weight, obsidian becomes progressively hydrated when exposed to groundwater, forming perlite.|$|E
25|$|The first {{domestication}} probably {{occurred in}} West Africa, but the black-eyed pea is widely grown {{in many countries}} in Asia; it was introduced into the Southern United States {{as early as the}} 17th century in Virginia. Most of the black-eyed pea cultivation in the region, however, took firmer hold in Florida and the Carolinas during the 18th century, reaching Virginia in full force following the American Revolution. The crop would also eventually prove popular in Texas. Throughout the South, the black-eyed pea is still a widely used ingredient in soul food and cuisines of the Southern United States. The planting of crops of black-eyed peas was promoted by George Washington Carver <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> legume, it adds nitrogen to the soil and has high nutritional value. Black-eyed peas contain calcium (41mg) folate (356 mcg), protein (13.22 g), fiber (11.1 g) and vitamin A (26 IU), among other nutrients, all for less than 200 Calories, in a 171-g, one-cup serving.|$|E
5000|$|It was in Iraq that Buzzell began {{publishing}} a blog {{under the title}} [...] "CBFTW", [...] "Colby Buzzel Fuck The War", <b>as</b> <b>a</b> replacement for his habitual journaling back in the States. The blog gained popularity quickly, <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> anonymous blogger, Buzzell was able to share more lucid experiences than an embedded journalist, {{and he was also}} able to share a bit more of the truth than the Army was able to.|$|R
50|$|Later on in May 1945, {{he again}} sought the {{registration}} {{of the same}} land but the herein respondent, Register of Deeds, denied the application <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> alien, Krivenko was disqualified to own land pursuant {{to the laws of}} the Philippine jurisdiction. Krivenko brought the case to the Court of First Instance of Manila which sustained the refusal of the Register of Deeds of Manila. He then appealed to the Supreme Court.|$|R
5000|$|When Mahvash {{died in a}} car {{accident}} in 1961, her public funeral went down in Iran’s history as the largest of its day, with thousands of Iranians on the streets to mark her passing.
