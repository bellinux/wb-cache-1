40|$|Glass {{has been}} made and used for centuries but South African artists, {{isolated}} {{for the last three}} decades, are only now becoming aware of the potential of hot or warm glass as an art medium. In antiquity glass objects were created using various processes but the 'factory' tradition began with the discovery of the <b>blowing</b> <b>iron</b> in the first century AD. The invention of the tank furnace in the late 1950 s revolutionised modem production, enabling individual artists to make glass in private studios without blowing teams. The research describes ancient [...] glassmaking processes and indicates how they have been explored, adapted and used by contemporary artists world wide, challenging craft orientated paradigms, and proving that glass is a viable and important sculpture medium. The practical research demonstrates the application of many processes and relates technical issues to sculptural concepts which are realized through the physical and material properties of glass.

40|$|The {{motivation}} for the research was to expand on the creative possibilities of air bubbles in glass, {{through the application of}} digital and kiln technologies to formulate and control complex air entrapment, for new configurations in glass art. In comparison to glassblowing, air entrapment in kiln forming glass practice is under-developed and undocumented. This investigation has devised new, replicable techniques to position and manipulate air in kiln-formed glass, termed collectively as Kiln-controlled Precision Air Entrapment. As a result of the inquiry, complex assemblages of text and figurative imagery have been produced that allow the articulation of expressive ideas using air voids, which were not previously possible. The research establishes several new innovations for air-entrapment in glass, as well as forming a technical hypotheses and a practice-based methodology. The research focuses primarily on float glass and the application of CNC abrasive waterjet cutting technology; incorporating computer aided design and fabrication alongside more conventional glass-forming methods. The 3 -axis CNC abrasive waterjet cutting process offers accuracy of cut and complexity of form and scale, across a flat plane of sheet glass. The new method of cleanly fusing layered, waterjet-cut float glass permits the fabrication of artwork containing air entrapment as multilayered, intricate groupings and composite three-dimensional void forms. Kiln-controlled air entrapment presents a number of significant advantages over conventional glassblowing techniques of air entrapment which are based around the decorative vessel or solid spheroid shaped on the <b>blowing</b> <b>iron.</b> The integration of digital and traditional technologies and the resulting technical glassmaking discoveries in this research advance potential new contexts for air entrapment, in sculptural and architectural glass applications. Contexts include solid sculptures which explore the internal space of glass, to flat-plane panels and hot glass roll-up processes which take air entrapment beyond the limitations of its previous incarnations. The creative potential of Kiln-controlled Precision Air Entrapment for glass art is demonstrated through the development of a body of artworks and their dissemination in the field of practice. Documentation of the findings in the thesis has resulted in a 3 significant body of knowledge which opens up new avenues of understanding for academics, creative practitioners and professionals working with glass...|$|E

50|$|Oxygen blowing is {{a method}} of {{steelmaking}} where oxygen is <b>blown</b> through pig <b>iron</b> to lower the carbon content. Oxygen forms oxides with the unwanted elements, such as carbon, silicon, phosphorus, and manganese, which appear from various states of the manufacturing process.

5000|$|Iron making - the {{substitution}} of coke for charcoal greatly lowered the fuel cost for pig iron and wrought iron production. [...] Using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces, resulting in economies of scale. The cast <b>iron</b> <b>blowing</b> cylinder was first used in 1760. It was later improved by making it double acting, which allowed higher furnace temperatures. The puddling process produced a structural grade iron {{at a lower cost}} than the finery forge. [...] The rolling mill was fifteen times faster than hammering wrought iron. Hot blast (1828) greatly increased fuel efficiency in iron production in the following decades.|$|R

5000|$|The Cyfarthfa {{works were}} begun in 1765 by Anthony Bacon (by then a {{merchant}} in London), who {{in that year}} with William Brownrigg, his fellow native of Whitehaven, Cumberland leased the right to mine in a tract of 4000 acre land {{on the west side}} of the river Taff at Merthyr Tydfil. [...] They employed Brownrigg's brother-in-law Charles Wood to build a forge there, to use the potting and stamping process, for which he and his brother had a patent. This was powered by water from the river, the race dividing into six to power a clay mill (for making the pots), two stampers, two hammers and a chafery. The construction of the first coke blast furnace began in August 1766. This was intended to be 50 feet high with cast <b>iron</b> <b>blowing</b> cylinders, rather than the traditional bellows. It was probably brought into blast in Autumn 1767. [...] In the meantime, Plymouth ironworks was leased to provide pig iron for the forge.|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} {{presents the}} results of investigations, which had began in 1980 at the Rudi XX settlement in the Soroca District of the Republic of Moldova, obtained in 1982. There was confirmed the multi-layered structure of the site and the horizon of the Iron Age was first identified. But because of the small number and inexpressiveness of the ceramic findings, this layer was previously dated by a rather long period of time – from the late Hallstatt (7 th- 6 th centuries BC) to the Getic culture (4 th- 3 rd centuries BC). The discovered structure {{in the form of a}} heavily burned pit was attributed, as a hypothesis, to the Getic crematorium. The production character of the early medieval settlement has been confirmed (presence of iron slag, fragments of ceramic <b>blowing</b> nozzles and <b>iron</b> ore).

60|$|It {{may have}} been that the speedy action of the drug caused its effect to be evanescent, or, perhaps, that the strong {{constitution}} of the victim threw it off with unusual rapidity. Whatever the cause, {{it is certain that}} John Huxford suddenly came to himself, and found the foul trio squatted round their booty, which they were dividing into the two categories of what was of value and should be taken, and what was valueless and might therefore be left. With a bound he sprang out of bed, and seizing the fellow nearest him by the collar, he slung him through the open doorway. His brother rushed at him, but the young Devonshire man met him with such a facer that he dropped in a heap upon the ground. Unfortunately, the violence of the blow caused him to overbalance himself, and, tripping over his prostrate antagonist, he came down heavily upon his face. Before he could rise, the old hag sprang upon his back and clung to him, shrieking to her son to bring the poker. John managed to shake himself clear of them both, but before he could stand on his guard he was felled from behind by a crashing <b>blow</b> from an <b>iron</b> bar, which stretched him senseless upon the floor.|$|R

50|$|Despite Gephart's {{success in}} {{attracting}} investors, the iron markets remained weak, and Bellefonte Furnace closed down in June. Repairs were {{under way to}} bring it back into blast by September 1904. It was back in blast again by the end of October. Gephart's death the next year robbed his numerous enterprises of leadership, although it brought Bellefonte and Nittany Furnaces under a single management. They were still owned by different parties, and Bellefonte Furnace benefited somewhat from being tied to the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania. However, the Panic of 1907 proved to be the final <b>blow</b> for the <b>iron</b> industry in Bellefonte. Bellefonte Furnace went out of blast for the last time on December 21, 1910. For the time being, its most remunerative asset was its pile of furnace slag, which was used by Tom Shoemaker in the construction of a PRR railroad yard in Northumberland, Pennsylvania. In 1914, the furnace and its ore holdings were sold to the John Lowber Welsh estate, one of its bondholders. The furnace was demolished for scrap in 1915, and the ore pits were shut down and the company houses there dismantled. The Central Railroad of Pennsylvania was dealt a mortal blow by the loss of the furnace traffic. Under the presidency of Gephart's son, it struggled on for a few more years before abandonment in 1918.|$|R
