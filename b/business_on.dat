5|$|In {{contrast}} to the Civil War, when hostilities sharply curtailed <b>business</b> <b>on</b> the Old Bay Line, World War I doubled freight and passenger <b>business</b> <b>on</b> the line to the busy ports of Norfolk and the Hampton Roads area, with 107,664 passengers using the line in 1917. As a result of congestion on the nation's railroads and ports when the U.S. entered the war in April 1917, the Federal government established the wartime U.S. Railroad Administration (USRA) {{to take charge of}} railroads and steamship companies, including the Baltimore Steam Packet Company. The USRA directed the operations of the Old Bay Line and the rival Chesapeake line {{for the duration of the}} war and more than a year thereafter, until March 1, 1920.|$|E

He had a hand in founding the NFL Alumni Association, a charitable organization.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{has also}} {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} new cultural forms. Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example would feature an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a <b>business</b> <b>on</b> the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.|$|E

5|$|In 1799, a schoolhouse was {{constructed}} on West Creek near Benton. It {{was one of}} the first schoolhouses in the vicinity of Benton. During the 1864 elections, at least two Union soldiers were stationed on the creek, guarding the polling venues. A mill called the Thomas Mill was built on the creek in 1865 and remained operational in 1914, when it was owned by N.B. Cole. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, there was a timber-producing <b>business</b> <b>on</b> the creek, run by J. Harvey Creveling.|$|E

5|$|Steamboat {{companies}} rightly saw nationwide railroads as {{a threat}} to their <b>business.</b> <b>On</b> May 6, 1856, just weeks after the bridge was completed, a steamboat captain deliberately crashed the Effie Afton into the bridge. The owner of the Effie Afton, John Hurd, filed a lawsuit against the Rock Island Railroad Company. Abraham Lincoln was the lead defense lawyer for the railroad company. The decision of the United States Supreme Court upheld the right to bridge navigable streams, therefore the bridge was allowed to remain.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Ace Cafe {{was based}} on the North Circular Road. Open 24 hours a day, it catered for late-night party-goers and boy racers. It was a popular place for cars to be hot-wired and stolen, as drivers knew they could make a quick getaway. Regus founder Mark Dixon's first <b>business</b> <b>on</b> returning to Britain after an extended time aboard was a hot-dog stand on the North Circular Road, making his own buns. He grew the business into a full-time bakery which he sold in 1989 for £800,000 (now £).|$|E

5|$|The second rule of privity, that a {{third party}} cannot claim {{benefits}} from a contract, was widely criticised by academics, members of the judiciary and legal professionals. One {{problem was that the}} rule made no exceptions for cases where it was obviously intended for the third party to claim a benefit, such as in Beswick v Beswick, where an uncle gave his nephew a <b>business,</b> <b>on</b> the condition that the nephew would pay the uncle a certain amount per week, and in the event of the uncle's death, give a similar amount to his widow.|$|E
5|$|A committee, {{headed by}} Thorpe, was {{established}} to recruit employees and headquartered itself at Labor Hall. Throughout September and October, many employees began to join the union, but the Terminal and Traction Company responded by firing employees who joined and refused to recognize the union. After the failure of their initial attempt to have the union recognized by the company, the committee petitioned the United States Department of Labor to mediate discussions {{between them and the}} management of the <b>business.</b> <b>On</b> October 27, 1913, the department offered Ethelbert Stewart, head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to mediate. To begin negotiations, the workers' committee submitted a list of grievances to the company and Stewart. The company, however, refused his services, denied there was a labor problem and said no attempt at unionizing was being made. They insisted that only a small minority of workers were behind the troubles and alleged that it was outside influences behind the unionizing effort. In a later report, the Department of Labor claimed that had their offer of mediation been accepted, the subsequent strike and riot could have been averted.|$|E
5|$|After an aborted {{attempt by}} Kennedy to bring yet another studio that {{had turned to}} him for help, First National Pictures, into the Photophone fold, RCA was ready to step back in: the company {{acquired}} Kennedy's stock in both FBO and the KAO theater <b>business.</b> <b>On</b> October 23, 1928, RCA announced {{the creation of the}} Radio-Keith-Orpheum holding company, with Sarnoff as chairman of the board. Kennedy, who withdrew from his executive positions in the merged companies, kept Pathé separate from RKO and under his personal control. RCA owned the governing stock interest in RKO, 22 percent; in the early 1930s, RCA's share of stock in the company rose as high as 60 percent. The company's production and distribution arm, presided over by former FBO vice-president Joseph I. Schnitzer, was incorporated early in 1929 as Radio Pictures. Looking {{to get out of the}} film business the following year, Kennedy arranged in late 1930 for RKO to purchase Pathé from him.|$|E
