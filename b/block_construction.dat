The Interborough Rapid Transit Company, which at the time was the operator of all the routes serving the 42nd Street station, originally sued to <b>block</b> <b>construction</b> of the new entrance because it would cause crowding, but the New York City Board of Transportation pushed to allow the corridor anyway. Chrysler eventually built and paid for the building's subway entrance. Work on the new entrance started in March 1930 and it opened along with the Chrysler Building two months later.|$|E
5|$|Avatar—one of {{the main}} {{developers}} of Poinciana—had long planned to connect Kinney Harmon Road with the Cypress Parkway in order to relieve congestion along Poinciana and Pleasant Hill Boulevards. However, the highway would not be built until the company was able to develop the community according to plan. Despite being included in the comprehensive land use plans of both Polk and Osceola Counties, the Polk County Commission voted in 1997 to vacate right-of-way along Kinney Harmon Road to a developer to build a 495-lot mobile home park, {{a move that would}} effectively <b>block</b> <b>construction</b> of the Poinciana Parkway. The commissioners noted that the road had been discussed for years, but there were still no plans to build it at the time. Avatar sued the county and the 10th Judicial Circuit ruled that the commissioners did not explain why vacating the right-of-way would be in the public interest when making their decision. Osceola County had objected the commissioners' decision and helped Avatar in the case, but did not join the lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|The Residences at The Ritz-Carlton is {{a luxury}} {{residential}} skyscraper in Center City in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At , the 48-story skyscraper is the twelfth-tallest building in Philadelphia, and the tallest residential tower in the city. The building was erected on the former site of One Meridian Plaza which was seriously damaged by a deadly fire in 1991. One Meridian Plaza was demolished in 1999 and the property was sold by E/R Partners to the Arden Group the next year. Development of the site by the Arden Group, which owns the adjacent Ritz-Carlton Philadelphia, was delayed for years {{as a result of}} a feud with rival developer Mariner Commercial Properties. Mariner owned the property 1441 Chestnut Street, which sits south of the Residences at The Ritz-Carlton site and intends to build its own residential tower. The feud began after Arden Group's lead partner Craig Spencer blocked approval of 1441 Chestnut Street because he felt the tower's design would be detrimental to the planned Residences at The Ritz-Carlton tower. This led to several years of dispute between the developers trying to <b>block</b> <b>construction</b> of each other's towers.|$|E

25|$|The <b>block</b> <b>construction</b> {{method was}} invented in the United States, because German U-boats were sinking more ships than could be built with {{existing}} methods.

25|$|Ludwig {{had started}} Universe Tankships in 1947 and began {{building}} larger tankers in his Welding Shipyards. The Bulkpetrol of 30,000 long tons {{was the largest}} tanker of its time. Four of the five Bulk class tankers sank, likely because welding technology was not yet fully understood. As larger ships could not be constructed in the yard at Norfolk, Virginia, Ludwig went to Japan where he introduced the <b>block</b> <b>construction</b> method at the Kure Naval Yard. Here, in 1952, he built the Petrokure of 38,000 long tons. That same year, Onassis had a tanker of 45,000 long tons built and also Niarchos had supertankers built.

Several attempts were made to <b>block</b> <b>construction</b> even {{after the end of the}} tent city, including an appeal to the United States Congress and the Department of the Interior to have the area declared a National Historic Landmark, which ended up being unsuccessful. Additional rallies were held that year, including one attended by Joan Baez on August 20. After several additional unsuccessful legal challenges, construction finally began on September 19 and was finished in 1979.|$|E
25|$|However, in June 1987, the National Park Service {{reversed}} its ruling after Montgomery County {{agreed to}} build noise barriers and wildlife crossings and purchase land {{to compensate for}} the woods lost to construction of the highway. By this time, parts of the highway were under construction in Rockville and Germantown. The first segment of the highway, from Middlebrook Road south to MD 117, opened in August 1987. The second segment to open was from Darnestown Road, then part of MD 28, north to MD 124; this southern segment was open by April 1989. The coalition of civic and environmental groups filed another lawsuit in March 1988 seeking to <b>block</b> <b>construction</b> of the middle segment from MD 124 to MD 117, but the lawsuit was dismissed on appeal in April 1989. Montgomery County began construction on the middle section in 1988 while the lawsuit was working its way through the courts because they were confident of prevailing. Great Seneca Highway fully opened when the middle section was completed in June 1990. In 1999, Great Seneca Highway north of MD 28 was designated MD 119 as part of a statecounty maintenance swap in which 22 state highways were transferred to Montgomery County maintenance.|$|E

If successful, the efforts would have left the freeway with a gap in the middle between the first (western) and second (eastern) phases of construction. During this time, MDOT assigned M-6 to the eastern section of the freeway under construction. Signs were erected along the service roads that followed 11Mile Road to connect the already built stack interchange at I-75 east to I-94. By the time the eastern freeway segment was completed in 1979, the signage for M-6 was removed and replaced with I-696 signage, leaving an [...] gap in the I-696 freeway until completion of the central section in 1989.|$|E
500|$|This {{is a list}} of {{representative}} Merlin variants, describing some of the mechanical changes made during development of the Merlin.

500|$|Looking {{for a new}} {{headquarters}} Comcast asked Arden Group and Mariner Commercial Properties to {{work together}} and combine the properties into one building. The two developers briefly held discussions about combining the two sites, but by 2001 no agreement was reached and both developers had decided to move on with their own towers. As they sought to build competing condominium towers, {{the relationship between the two}} developers soon turned into a feud between the firm's lead partners, Craig Spencer of Arden Group and Tim Mahoney of Mariner Commercial Properties. In 2003 Mahoney received permission from the City Zoning Board of Adjustment to build a 50-story residential tower at the 1441 Chestnut Street site. At the zoning hearing Spencer attempted to block approval by saying the building was too tall and that it would damage his site by blocking views and casting shadows. He also said the tower was [...] "snubbing his nose at the traditional zone of respect around City Hall." [...] Spencer filed a lawsuit to <b>block</b> <b>construction</b> of the building and a Court of Common Pleas ruled that the Zoning Board erred in approving 1441 Chestnut Street.

The tornado then crossed the Mulberry Fork again, moving into Blount County, where it crossed Interstate 65, before crossing the Mulberry Fork into Cullman County southwest of Garden City. It quickly crossed the river again (the seventh crossing), moving back into Blount County. As it continued to the south-southwest of Garden City, it straddled the Mulberry Fork before finally moving solidly into Blount County and toward Blountsville. On the southeast side of Blountsville, the tornado caused high-end EF2 damage to multiple well-built brick and slab foundation homes, one of which had some exterior walls collapse. The storm continued to the northeast and out of Blountsville, where two additional homes sustained high-end EF3 damage. A large portion of one of the homes was wiped off of its foundation; however, its garage sustained only minor roof damage. At the second of these two homes, a dump truck was thrown [...] The tornado then moved into Marshall County, causing significant damage to a house and completely destroying an industrial plant at EF2 strength.
