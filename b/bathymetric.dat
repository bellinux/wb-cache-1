The JACC works closely with the ATSB, which is the agency responsible for defining the search area and carrying out the tenders for the underwater search and, if possible pieces of Flight 370 are located, the recovery effort. Geoscience Australia works closely with the ATSB to perform the <b>bathymetric</b> survey and underwater search. The JACC also works with Malaysia and China, which have both sent representatives {{to work at the}} JACC offices.|$|E
5|$|The lake has {{a maximum}} depth of 17feet (5.3m). The lake is often {{reported}} to be deeper, but <b>bathymetric</b> surveys by the Royal Park in 2010 revealed {{the design of the}} lake.|$|E
5|$|The {{landmark}} scientific expedition (December 1872 – May 1876) of the British Royal Navy {{survey ship}} HMS Challenger yielded {{a tremendous amount}} of <b>bathymetric</b> data, much of which has been confirmed by subsequent researchers. <b>Bathymetric</b> data obtained {{during the course of the}} Challenger expedition enabled scientists to draw maps, which provided a rough outline of certain major submarine terrain features, such as the edge of the continental shelves and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This discontinuous set of data points was obtained by the simple technique of taking soundings by lowering long lines from the ship to the seabed.|$|E
5|$|Lōʻihi Seamount's first {{depiction}} {{on a map}} was on Survey Chart 4115, a <b>bathymetric</b> {{rendering of}} part of Hawaiʻi compiled by the US Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1940. At the time, the seamount was non-notable, being one of many in the region. A large earthquake swarm first brought attention to it in 1952. That same year, geologist Gordon A. MacDonald hypothesized that the seamount was actually an active submarine shield volcano, similar to the two active Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea. Macdonald's hypothesis placed the seamount as the newest volcano in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, created by the Hawaiʻi hotspot. However, because the earthquakes were oriented east–west (the direction of the volcanic fault) {{and there was no}} volcanic tremor in seismometers distant from the seamount, Macdonald attributed the earthquake to faulting rather than a volcanic eruption.|$|E

25|$|A {{detailed}} <b>bathymetric</b> / {{hydrographic survey}} of the River Irvine had been previously undertaken to develop the strategies for recovering City of Adelaide from the riverbank. This was necessary as the river had silted up over the twenty years since the clipper was slipped.|$|E
25|$|The Gulf of Aqaba {{was created}} by {{movement}} on four left-stepping strike-slip fault segments in a diagonal stepwise sequence known as echelon formation. In the areas where these segments overlap, pull-apart basins have developed, forming three <b>bathymetric</b> lows known as the Daka Deep, the Aragonese Deep and the Elat Deep. Parts of three of these faults ruptured during the 1995 Gulf of Aqaba earthquake.|$|E
25|$|With {{her home}} port at the Pacific Marine Center, Seattle, Washington, Davidson, {{along with her}} only sister ship, McArthur, spent her career {{conducting}} hydrographic surveys along the United States West Coast; in Alaskan waters, including in Prince William Sound in 1974, Tracy Arm, Endicott Arm, and Skagway Harbor; in San Diego Bay in 1975; and in the Pacific Ocean. She had a <b>Bathymetric</b> Swath Survey System (a stabilized deep-mapping sonar) and a Hydroplot data-recording system.|$|E
25|$|Most corals must {{attach to}} a hard surface {{in order to}} begin growing but sea fans can also live on soft sediments. They are often found growing along <b>bathymetric</b> highs such as seamounts, ridges, pinnacles and mounds, on hard surfaces. Corals are sedentary, so they must live near nutrient-rich water currents. Deep-water corals feed on {{zooplankton}} and rely on ocean currents to bring food. The currents also aid in cleaning the corals.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of the inner trench slope and a first-order control on trench morphology is determined by sediment supply. Active accretionary prisms are common in trenches near continents where rivers or glaciers supply great volumes of sediment to the trench. These filled trenches may lack the <b>bathymetric</b> expression of a trench. The Cascadia margin of the northwest USA is a filled trench, the result of sedimentation by the rivers of the western United States and Canada.|$|E
25|$|Multibeam {{bathymetry}} {{data and}} high resolution seismic reflection data {{acquired in the}} Saguenay Fjord {{has been used to}} identify a series of landslide deposits that were probably triggered by the 1663 earthquake. The Saguenay region is the site of a geological graben and has been subject to several natural disasters {{since the turn of the}} seventeenth century. In 1996 it was the site of the largest flood in 20th-century Canadian history, which led to the investigation of the fjord bottom using <b>bathymetric</b> data to determine slope stability.|$|E
25|$|Terrigenous {{sediment}} {{supply to}} the deepwater bottom-currents and to the nepheloid layer primarily depends on climate and tectonics in the continental environment. The rate of tectonic uplift {{is directly related to}} the amount of sediment available and variations in sea level will determine the ease with which this sediment is transported basinward. The sediment will most likely reach deepwater in the form of turbidity flows, which travel across <b>bathymetric</b> contours, only to be “blown” parallel to these contours as the finer sediments cross a deepwater bottom-current. Other sources of terrigenous sediment may include airborne and seaborne volcanoclastic debris.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the command}} of Commander John A. Howell, USN, George S. Blake {{immediately}} began innovative deep ocean work in 1874. Attached to the ship in the Gulf of Mexico was Lieutenant Commander D. Sigsbee to test his new device for releasing the heavy shot weights used in deep soundings. With development and installation of Sigsbee's sounding machine George S. Blake became the primary deep ocean sounding ship alternating between the Gulf of Maine and northern waters in summer and southern waters in winter. Soundings in the Gulf of Mexico {{by the end of}} 1875 were sufficient for production of the first true oceanic basin <b>bathymetric</b> chart.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of the term contourite has varied throughout the decades. Originally, Heezen et al. (1966) defined the concept, without using the actual word, as a sedimentary deposit on the continental rise derived from thermohaline-induced geostrophic bottom-currents that flow parallel to <b>bathymetric</b> contours. They did this to emphasize the difference between these deposits and turbidites in order to explain the ubiquitous smoothness and lack of irregularities of the continental rise in the Blake-Bahama Basin. Before this, it was thought that only turbidity flows were capable of depositing and reworking sediment at depths greater than the continental slope. Hollister and Heezen (1972) adopted the name contourite for these deposits and provided a list of characteristics that described their sediments. Faugères and Stow (1993) note that as research on the subject developed, the term contourite was used to describe various forms of sedimentary deposits from bottom-currents including those at much shallower depths and even in lacustrine settings. They suggested going back to the original {{definition of}} a contourite, that is for deposits at depths greater than 500 m derived from stable thermohaline-induced geostrophic bottom-currents (i.e. deepwater bottom-currents), in order to avoid using the same name when describing sedimentary deposits formed by different processes. They also suggest the umbrella term bottom-current deposit, which includes contourites and deposits generated by other bottom-currents.|$|E
25|$|The WSC has {{a unique}} {{structure}} as it flows poleward off the western coast of Spitsbergen. It is easiest to discuss horizontal movements and vertical movements of the WSC, separately. The WSC begins its movement in the Norwegian Sea where it branches off the Norwegian Atlantic Current and arrives at Spitsbergen's western coast, where it is guided by the <b>bathymetric</b> profile of the ocean floor surrounding Svalbard. Specifically, it tends to follow along steep continental shelves. The current is quite narrow and strong, having a width of roughly 100 kilometers and a maximum speed of 35cm/s. At about 80° North latitude the WSC splits into two different sections, the Svalbard branch and the Yermak Branch. The Svalbard Branch continues to follow the continental shelf northeastward, and eventually sinks to an intermediate depth and is cyclonically recirculated throughout the Arctic, eventually being pushed out through the East Greenland Current. The Yermak Branch moves northwesterly till about 81°N, and then it moves directly westward and eventually equatorward in the Return Atlantic Current. The Return Atlantic Current is directly east of the East Greenland Current. The high salinity and warm temperatures of the Return Atlantic Current compared to the cold temperatures and low salinities of the EGC contribute {{to the existence of}} the East Greenland Polar Front a result of the strong gradient in both salinity and temperature. There is a current that splits off from the Yermak Branch and flows towards the Northeast at a higher latitude. This current is not well understood in the literature, and thus more information is needed. It is believed this current loops back into the Svalbard Branch further along in its track eastward.|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s, the Hawaiian {{seafloor}} was mapped using ship-based sonar. Computed SYNBAPS (Synthetic <b>Bathymetric</b> Profiling System) data filled holes {{between the}} ship-based sonar <b>bathymetric</b> measurements. From 1994 to 1998 the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) mapped Hawaii in detail and studied its ocean floor, {{making it one}} of the world's best-studied marine features. The JAMSTEC project, a collaboration with USGS and other agencies, utilized manned submersibles, remotely operated underwater vehicles, dredge samples, and core samples. The Simrad EM300 multibeam [...] side-scanning sonar system collected bathymetry and backscatter data.|$|E
500|$|In late June 2014, {{details of}} {{the next phase of}} the search were announced; {{officials}} have called this phase the [...] "underwater search", despite the previous seafloor sonar survey.

These debris flows can be sorted into two broad categories: slumps, mass movement over slopes which slowly flatten their originators, and more catastrophic debris avalanches, which fragment volcanic slopes and scatter volcanic debris past their slopes. These slides have caused massive tsunamis and earthquakes, fractured volcanic massifs, and scattered debris hundreds of miles away from their source.|$|E
