Finally, I find no evidence that employment status is related to <b>bank</b> <b>note</b> demand, but that {{there is a difference between}} the <b>bank</b> <b>note</b> demand of men aged 15 - 24 and women aged 15 - 24 : increases in the share of women aged 15 - 24 lead to increases in <b>bank</b> <b>note</b> demand...|$|R

This paper describes some lessons relevant to e-money from the U. S. experience during this period. It argues that Federal Reserve notes were not issued to be a superior currency to national <b>bank</b> <b>notes.</b> Rather, they were issued to enable the Federal Reserve System to act as a lender of last resort in times of financial stress. It also argues that the reason to eventually eliminate national <b>bank</b> <b>notes</b> was that they were potentially a source of bank reserves. As such, they could have threatened the Federal Reserve System’s control of the reserves of the banking system and thereby the Fed’s control of monetary policy. <b>Bank</b> <b>notes,</b> E-Money, Financial service...|$|R

50|$|Federal Reserve <b>Bank</b> <b>Notes,</b> issued between 1915 and 1934, are {{banknotes}} {{that are}} legal tender in the United States, together with United States Notes, silver certificates, Gold Certificates, National <b>Bank</b> <b>Notes</b> and Federal Reserve Notes.

Federal Reserve <b>Bank</b> <b>Notes</b> differ from Federal Reserve Notes {{in that they are}} backed by one of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks, rather than by all collectively.

40|$|Beginning in 1864, in the United States <b>notes</b> of {{national}} <b>banks</b> were the predominant medium of exchange. Each national bank issued its own notes. E-money shares {{many of the}} characteristics of these <b>bank</b> <b>notes.</b> This paper describes some lessons relevant to emoney from the U. S. experience with national <b>bank</b> <b>notes.</b> It examines historical evidence on how well the <b>bank</b> <b>notes</b> - a privately-issued currency system with multiple issuers - functioned with respect to ease of transacting, counterfeiting, safety, overissuance and par exchange (a uniform currency). It finds that <b>bank</b> <b>notes</b> made transacting easier and were not subject to overissuance. National <b>bank</b> <b>notes</b> were perfectly safe because they were insured by the federal government. Further, national <b>bank</b> <b>notes</b> were a uniform currency. <b>Notes</b> of different <b>banks</b> traded at par {{with each other and with}} greenbacks. This paper describes the mechanism that was put in place to achieve uniformity. The U. S. experience with national <b>bank</b> <b>notes</b> suggests that a privately-issued e-money system can operate efficiently but will require government intervention, regulation, and supervision to minimize counterfeiting, promote safety and provide the mechanism necessary for different media of exchange to exchange at par with each other...|$|R
