5|$|After the 1954 World Cup, the {{selection}} committee resumed their duties, continuing until {{the appointment of}} Matt <b>Busby</b> in 1958. <b>Busby</b> was initially unable to assume his duties due to the serious injuries he sustained in the Munich air disaster, with Dawson Walker taking charge of the team while <b>Busby</b> recovered. <b>Busby</b> only took charge of two Scotland matches, but he did give a young Denis Law his first Scotland cap. In March 1959, Andy Beattie became Scotland manager for a second time. During his second spell as Scotland manager, Beattie combined those duties with managing a football club. He resigned in November 1960 in order to manage English club Nottingham Forest on a full-time basis.|$|E
5|$|Duncan Edwards (1 October 1936 – 21 February 1958) was an English footballer {{who played}} for Manchester United and the England {{national}} team. He {{was one of the}} <b>Busby</b> Babes, the young United team formed under manager Matt <b>Busby</b> in the mid-1950s, playing 151 matches for the club. One of eight players who {{died as a result of}} the Munich air disaster, he survived initially but succumbed to his injuries in hospital two weeks later.|$|E
5|$|From 1872 to 1953, and 1954 to 1957, the Scotland {{national}} team {{was appointed by}} a selection committee. Andy Beattie was manager for six matches in 1954 when Scotland competed at their first World Cup. After the tournament the selection committee resumed their duties, continuing until the appointment of Matt <b>Busby</b> in 1958. <b>Busby</b> was initially unable to assume his duties due to the serious injuries he sustained in the Munich air disaster.|$|E

5|$|While <b>Busby</b> was in {{hospital}} {{recovering from the}} injuries he sustained in the air crash, his managerial duties were left to his assistant, Jimmy Murphy. After <b>Busby</b> recovered, he set about rebuilding his side, and within five years, in 1963, he had won the FA Cup {{for the first time}} in 15 years. This was followed up by two league titles in three years, and then the greatest prize in European club football, the European Cup. He continued as manager for one more year after this success, leaving his managerial duties to club trainer Wilf McGuinness. McGuinness struggled in his new post, however, and <b>Busby</b> was convinced to return for the second half of the 1970–71 season. However, he retired from football permanently that summer, and was succeeded that summer by Frank O'Farrell. O'Farrell's stay was short-lived, though, as his inability to control George Best's extravagances forced the board to sack him with three years still to run on his contract.|$|E
5|$|Anne Wales Abbot was {{believed}} to be the designer of the Ives' game, The Mansion of Happines for over 145 years, from 1843 to 1989. She, however, did not design Ives The Mansion of Happiness but did design two other Ives' games: Dr. <b>Busby</b> and Master Rodbury and His Pupils.|$|E
5|$|Coal mining {{was also}} {{carried out in}} Giffnock, between 1850 and 1926. The coal {{produced}} was of a very poor quality and was of little value to householders. The main use of Giffnock coal was with commercial and industrial customers such as <b>Busby</b> Gas Works.|$|E

5|$|Reserve {{team manager}} Jimmy Murphy {{took over as}} manager while <b>Busby</b> {{recovered}} from his injuries and the club's makeshift side reached the FA Cup final, which they lost to Bolton Wanderers. In recognition of the team's tragedy, UEFA invited the club {{to compete in the}} 1958–59 European Cup alongside eventual League champions Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite approval from the FA, the Football League determined that the club should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified. <b>Busby</b> rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as Denis Law and Pat Crerand, who combined with the next generation of youth players – including George Best – to win the FA Cup in 1963. The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English (and second British) club to win the European Cup, beating Benfica 4–1 in the final with a team that contained three European Footballers of the Year: Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best. Matt <b>Busby</b> resigned as manager in 1969 and was replaced by the reserve team coach, former Manchester United player Wilf McGuinness.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{returned}} to the studio and made Hard to Handle in 1933. This {{was followed by a}} steady stream of films, including the highly regarded Footlight Parade, which gave Cagney the chance to return to his song-and-dance roots. The film includes show-stopping scenes with <b>Busby</b> Berkeley-choreographed routines. His next notable film was 1934's Here Comes the Navy, which paired him with Pat O'Brien for the first time. The two would have an enduring friendship.|$|E
5|$|Including {{the victory}} over Leeds in 1975, Bayern Munich {{had won the}} European Cup on three {{occasions}} going into the 1999 final. With three victories in a row from 1974 to 1976, they became only the third team to achieve such a feat after Real Madrid (1956 to 1960) and Ajax (1971 to 1973). They had also finished as runners-up twice: in 1982 against Aston Villa and 1987 against Porto. Although Bayern had been waiting 23 years for a European Cup title, Manchester United had had to wait even longer, their only victory having come in 1968. Their manager then was Matt <b>Busby,</b> who had been seriously injured in the Munich air disaster, which killed eight of his players {{on the way back}} from a European Cup tie in Belgrade 10 years earlier, before rebuilding the team to become European Cup winners. <b>Busby</b> died in 1994; the day of the 1999 Champions League final would have been his 90th birthday.|$|E

5|$|Joe Mercer, who {{was then}} {{coaching}} the England schools team, urged <b>Busby</b> to sign Edwards, who was also attracting interest from Wolverhampton Wanderers and Aston Villa. Edwards signed for United as an amateur on 2 June 1952, but accounts of when he signed his first professional contract vary. Some reports state that it occurred on his 17th birthday in October 1953, but others contend that it took place a year earlier. Those accounts that favour the earlier date usually state that a club official, either <b>Busby</b> himself or coach Bert Whalley, arrived at the Edwards family home soon after midnight to secure the youngster's signature as early as possible, but other reports claim that this occurred when he signed his amateur contract. Wolves manager Stan Cullis was indignant at missing out on a highly touted local youngster and accused United of improperly offering financial inducements to Edwards or his family, but Edwards maintained that he {{had always wanted to}} play for the Lancashire team. To guard against the possibility that he might not make a success of his football career, he also began an apprenticeship as a carpenter.|$|E
5|$|The 1958 FIFA World Cup finals saw Scotland {{draw their}} first game against Yugoslavia 1–1, but they then lost to Paraguay and France {{and went out}} at the first stage.

5|$|The 1958 Munich air {{disaster}} {{claimed the}} lives of eight players. In 1968, under the management of Matt <b>Busby,</b> Manchester United became the first English football club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson won 38 trophies as manager, including 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA Champions Leagues, between 1986 and 2013, when he announced his retirement. José Mourinho is the club's current manager, having been appointed on 27 May 2016.|$|E

5|$|When BSkyB publicised their {{intentions}} {{to take over}} Manchester United, supporters reacted furiously to the news. The majority felt the club’s traditions, built on a loyal fan base and great teams including the <b>Busby</b> Babes and currently Fergie's Fledglings would just be tarnished forever. United were no longer an independent entity, and major decisions affecting the club looked increasingly likely to be taken {{on the other side}} of the globe.|$|E
5|$|As a pupil at Dunfermline High School, Liddell studied chemistry, mathematics, physics, English and {{two other}} languages. He became a {{reluctant}} rugby player, {{under the guidance of}} retired Welsh international Ronnie Boon, while playing football for local teams and Scotland Schoolboys. By the age of 16, Liddell had progressed sufficiently to earn a contract with Lochgelly Violet football club and be sought after by Liverpool, Hamilton Academical, and Partick Thistle. Liverpool manager George Kay became interested in signing Liddell on the recommendation of the club's Scottish defender Matt <b>Busby,</b> who learned of the teenager from Manchester City's Alex Herd while on a golf trip. Herd had forwent one of their rounds to take Willie McAndrew, manager of Hamilton, to watch Liddell play for Lochgelly. When <b>Busby</b> queried him about his absence and Liddell, Herd told him that a contract had not been agreed because limited resources prevented Hamilton from offering Liddell the assurances his parents insisted upon. Instead, Liddell signed for Liverpool as an amateur on 27 July 1938 and became a professional in 1939 on a weekly wage of £3. Negotiations between his parents and the club guaranteed, as a pre-requisite to acceptance, that Liverpool would permit Liddell to continue his accountancy studies, be housed in suitable accommodation, and be employed part-time an accountant at a company in the club's city.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, necklines plunged at the back, sleeves {{disappeared}} and sides were cut away and tightened. With {{the development of}} new clothing materials, particularly latex and nylon, through the 1930s swimsuits gradually began hugging the body, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning. Women's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of midriff exposure. Coco Chanel made suntans fashionable, and in 1932 French designer Madeleine Vionnet offered an exposed midriff in an evening gown. They were seen a year later in Gold Diggers of 1933. The <b>Busby</b> Berkeley film Footlight Parade of 1932 showcases aquachoreography that featured bikinis. Dorothy Lamour's The Hurricane (1937) also showed two-piece bathing suits.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-2000s, Ian Kiernan {{proposed}} that an abandoned water tunnel, <b>Busby's</b> Bore, be redirected to St James Lake where water could be stored and recycled. <b>Busby's</b> Bore was originally {{used to carry}} water from nearby swamps to the Hyde Park area, but was abandoned for that purpose in the 1890s after becoming contaminated by sewage.

The match however did not go as Wenger planned, as the team were beaten 6–0 by Chelsea. Wenger guided Arsenal to further FA Cup success {{at the end of the}} season, after a period of nine years without silverware. His team retained the cup the following year, and victory against Chelsea in the 2017 final placed Wenger as the most successful manager in the competition's history with seven trophies. Wenger is contracted to Arsenal until 2019.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, the regiment, {{in common}} with other Yeomanry and Militia units, sported a range of uniforms. Jackets were always dark blue. Between 1812 and 1873, a leather shako was worn, {{replaced}} in 1873 by a fur <b>Busby</b> with a red cloth bag. Service dress during the First World War was a khaki tunic and breeches, with a red stripe down the seam and a red lanyard worn by all ranks round the left armpit. The chevrons of sergeants and corporals were surmounted by a regimental badge on a red baize backing, a practice that continued through the inter-war years and beyond.|$|E
5|$|The {{east side}} of the stadium is also the site of Hotel Football, a football-themed hotel and fan clubhouse {{conceived}} by former Manchester United captain Gary Neville. The building is located on the {{east side of}} Sir Matt <b>Busby</b> Way and on the opposite side of the Bridgewater Canal from the stadium, and can accommodate up to 1,500 supporters. It opened in the summer of 2015. The venture is conducted separately from the club and was funded in part by proceeds from Neville's testimonial match.|$|E
50|$|Wilf McGuinness, {{the reserve}} team coach, was {{promoted}} to take Matt <b>Busby's</b> place as manager. He had {{been associated with the}} club since joining them as a player in the mid 1950s but he quickly faltered in the footsteps of the great man, and wasn't helped by <b>Busby's</b> presence in the background. United were an ageing side in need of refreshment, a circumstance McGuinness was unfortunate to come across. The club coped well enough in his first season in charge, managing an improved finish of 8th place compared to 11th place in <b>Busby's</b> final season. However, the cracks showed the following season, as the team floundered {{near the bottom of the}} table, and a League Cup elimination at the hands of Aston Villa, who at the time were mid-table in the Third Division, led to McGuinness being demoted back to his old reserve team position, and he left the club altogether shortly afterwards.|$|R
