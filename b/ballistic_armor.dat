40|$|Abstract:Dynamic {{response}} and fracture of high strength boride/alumina ceramic composite were investigated by split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) experiment in this paper. The compressive stress–strain curves and dynamic compression {{strength of the}} composites were tested. The surface’s microstructure of fractured composites were examined by using scanning electron microscope (SEM) to investigate the fracture mechanism. The results show that boride/alumina has high dynamic compressive strength and high Young’s modulus. The main fracture mode of the material is the fracture of the ceramic grains. The micro-voids and flaws, generated during the sintering and manufacturing of material and mechanical process of specimen, decrease {{the strength of the}} material because they provide the source of crack expansion when the material undergoes the dynamic loadings. Advanced ceramics are widely used as <b>ballistic</b> <b>armors</b> due to their excellent ratios of stiffness to weight and resistance to weight. Another appealing property of advanced ceramics is their capacity for dissipating energy by fracture and friction when they are comminuted by the impact of a projectile. Thus, the dynamic mechanical response of these materials is especially important to grant the required level of protection to armor. This is why some of the scientific research in thi...|$|R

5000|$|There are two {{variations}} of the Johnson-Holmquist model {{that are used to}} model the impact performance of ceramics under ballistically delivered loads. [...] These models were developed by Gordon R. Johnson and Timothy J.

The first version of the model is called the 1992 Johnson-Holmquist 1 (JH-1) model. [...] This original version was developed to account for large deformations but did not take into consideration progressive damage with increasing deformation; though the multi-segment stress-strain curves in the model can be interpreted as incorporating damage implicitly. The second version, developed in 1994, incorporated a damage evolution rule and is called the Johnson-Holmquist 2 (JH-2) model or, more accurately, the Johnson-Holmquist damage material model.|$|E

30|$|A {{major factor}} {{contributing}} to the human thermal comfort is the heat transfer between {{the human body and}} the environment (Starr et al. 2015), which is reflected by human temperature change. Obtaining human physiological parameter and subjective evaluation results when wearing the SRBA is an essential approach to minimize the heat strain and optimize the comfort of the body armor (Levine et al. 1998). Research on human thermal comfort has been conducted mainly focused on the impact of high ambient temperature (> 35  °C) and heavy weight protective clothing (> 10  kg) (Huiju et al. 2013; Majumdar et al. 1997), such as firefighting clothing or <b>ballistic</b> body <b>armor</b> (Caldwell et al. 2011; Lee et al. 2013). Generally, SRBA is much lighter than the <b>ballistic</b> body <b>armor,</b> which is about 3  kg in weight in this research. And the average daily working temperature in China of summer is about 30  °C. The purpose of this research is to investigate the impact of exercise intensity on human physiology parameters and subjective thermal sensation when wearing SRBA under daily working conditions in China (26 and 31  °C, 45 – 50  % relative humidity), and the relationship between the subjective judgement and the objective temperature change was analyzed.|$|R

When Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) began in March 2003, REF expanded its operations to include forward teams in Kuwait and Iraq. REF personnel provided manpower to support daily operations, but most importantly, REF continued to provide technology to fill capability gaps and to counter the highest priority threats. Improvised Explosive Devises (IEDs) quickly became the primary threat to American Soldiers in Iraq. To address this threat, REF partnered with the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Task Force, a precursor to JIEDDO, by providing support personnel and technology solutions.

5000|$|Anecdotes {{describing}} garments {{designed to}} protect the wearer from penetrating weapons can be found far back into recorded history. Two types of protective garment from the American Civil War in the 1860s had a basic design similar to the flak jacket or <b>ballistic</b> <b>armor</b> of modern times in that solid plates were used as the main ballistic protection. The [...] "Soldiers' Bullet Proof Vest" [...] was manufactured by the G. & D. Cook & Company of New Haven, Connecticut. It consisted of two pieces of steel inserted into the pockets of a regular black military vest. Versions for infantry weighed 3 ½ pounds while a version for cavalry and artillery weighed 7 pounds. They sold for $5-$7. A more medieval-looking type of armor was made by the Atwater Armor Company, also of New Haven. It consisted of four large plates of steel held on the body by broad metal hooks over the shoulders and a belt around the waist. The Atwater vest was heavier than the Cook models and cost about twice as much.|$|E
50|$|Simple <b>ballistic</b> <b>armor</b> was {{sometimes}} constructed by criminals. During the 1880s, {{a gang of}} Australian bushrangers led by Ned Kelly made basic armour from plough blades. By this time the Victorian Government had a reward for the capture {{of a member of}} the Kelly Gang at £8,000 (equivalent to 2 million Australian dollars in 2005). One of the stated aims of Kelly was the establishment of a Republic in North East Victoria. Each of the four Kelly gang members had fought a siege at a hotel clad in suits of armour made from the mouldboards of ploughs. The maker's stamp (Lennon Number 2 Type) was found inside several of the plates. The armour covered the mens' torsos, upper arms, and upper legs, and was worn with a helmet. The suits were roughly made on a creek bed using a makeshift forge and a stringy-bark log as a muffled anvil. The suits had a mass of around 44 kg (96 lb), making the wearer a spectacular sight, but greatly hampering movement. In a police raid at Glenrowan, the Kelly Gang armour deflected many hits with none penetrating, but eventually was of no use as the suits lacked protection for the legs and hands.|$|E

Components made by different companies will have to be made to work together in one suit. Power generation is the biggest problem, as there was no light-weight, low-bulk power generation system able to fuel TALOS components. Funding is also a concern, as SOCOM planned to spend $20 million per year on development to total $80 million, which some see as far too low. In previous endeavors to create [...] "digitized" [...] soldiers such as Land Warrior, the U.S. Army spent $500 million on three major contracts from 1996 to 2006 before its features became reliable.|$|E
5000|$|Later, even lighter {{carbines}} {{variants of}} many of these short-barreled assault rifles came to be adopted as the standard infantry weapon. In much modern tactical thinking, only a certain number of soldiers now need to retain longer-range weapons, these serving as designated marksmen. The rest can carry lighter, shorter-ranged weapons for close-quarters combat and suppressive fire. This is basically a more extreme extension of the idea that brought the original assault rifle. Another factor is that with the increasing weight of technology, sighting systems, <b>ballistic</b> <b>armor,</b> etc., the only way to reduce the burden on the modern soldier was to equip him/her with a smaller, lighter weapon. Also, modern soldier rely a great deal on vehicles and helicopters to transport them around the battle area, and a longer weapon can be a serious hindrance to entering and exiting these vehicles. Development of lighter assault rifles continued, matched by developments in even lighter carbines. In spite of the short barrels of the new assault rifles, carbines variants like the 5.45×39mm AKS-74U and Colt Commando were being developed for use when mobility was essential and a submachine gun wasn't sufficiently powerful. The AKS-74U featured an extremely short 8.1" [...] barrel which necessitated redesigning and shortening the gas-piston and integrating front sights onto the gas tube; the Colt Commando was a bit longer, at 11.5". Neither was adopted as standard issue, although the US did later adopt the somewhat-longer M4 carbine, with a 14.5" [...] barrel.|$|E
