Of the experience she said, I {{think a lot of}} females struggle with the way they look, and I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's a <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E

Lind said that these sales were [...] "definitely a <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> the band because it shows how the fanbase is growing.

[...] The album was certified gold in the United States in March 2002, and it had reached platinum status by August. It peaked at number 54 on the Billboard 200 on August 11, 2001. The album produced four singles: [...] "Bleed American", [...] "The Middle", [...] "Sweetness", and [...] "A Praise Chorus". The album's most successful single was [...] "The Middle". It managed to reach the number-one spot on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and number five on the Billboard Hot 100. As of September 2016, the album has sold over 1.6 million copies.|$|E
500|$|Rhys has a {{one-night stand}} with Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) not long after his introduction. Rhys meets Kate in the local bar {{and they have a}} [...] "big night out"; the {{following}} morning Kate wakes up in Rhys' apartment. Brewer told a writer for Inside Soap [...] "You don't actually see the lead-up– one minute she meets Rhys in a bar, the next minute we see that they've already slept together!" [...] Kate feels awkward about the situation, but it is made worse when she is unable to remember Rhys' name. When Kate and Rhys meet again, they have different attitudes to their one-night stand. Brewer said Rhys is [...] "a bit of a player", so it is not a <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> him. He does not have any expectations of Kate, but she is uncomfortable with it and tries to cover her tracks. In November 2011, Brewer said {{it would be interesting to}} revisit the relationship between Rhys and Kate. Barber also thought it would be interesting to see where the characters could go together. The actor added that [...] "sparks fly" [...] when Rhys is around Kate, as he knows how to [...] "press her buttons".|$|E

500|$|Valene's {{relationship}} with Gary {{is important to}} the understanding of her overall character. The Gary/Abby/Valene love triangle, which involved Gary cheating on Valene with Abby Cunningham – the show's main villain – was a monumental storyline for all three characters. Van Ark described the storyline:"There wasn’t really anything I could think of, but I will mention that Ted and I went in way early, whenever Donna Mills came on the show, and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby. I can’t believe I did that but it really provided me with some great stories. Because they were celebrating Donna Mills and she became the center but Gary and Val were supposed to be this enduring couple. Ted and I were saying Gary and Val should break up and Gary should go with Abby. It was a pretty <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> break up the couple that the show began with. So (the producers) were going toward this, then they pulled away but eventually returned to it. David Jacobs was against it but we convinced him. And it was the longest running story on the show. It took a long time for them to get back together. Eight years." ...|$|E
500|$|When Robbie {{first began}} filming, {{she was told}} that Donna was bisexual. Of this Robbie said, [...] "In one of the blocks she is talking to Bridget about their 'first time' and Donna asks Bridget if {{it was with a}} guy or girl? I liked the way the writers {{conveyed}} that, it was just really subtle and they didn't make a big coming out scene of it. I think it's a good message to send out because it's not such a <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> lots of people. Not all of them have such drama surrounding it". Donna's first storyline that included this aspect of her character was a kiss between herself and fellow female character, Sunny Lee (Hany Lee). The kiss occurs after Donna discovers that Sunny has been writing the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is shocked when Donna leans over and kisses her on the lips, as it is her first kiss. The show's producers called the kiss between Sunny and Donna as [...] "impulsive" [...] and Robbie agreed saying [...] "It's really not a big deal at all. It's not an actual gay storyline, it's just kind of an impulsive peck". The storyline came weeks after rival soap Home and Away endured a backlash to its own same-sex romance.|$|E
2500|$|La Vie Claire's {{victories}} came at {{a critical}} juncture in cycling. [...] According to Greg LeMond [...] "a huge movement" [...] towards doping began in Italy around the early 1990s.

At this point, <b>Big</b> <b>Deals</b> were limited <b>to</b> a range of $8,000 to $10,000. The trader could risk their <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> winnings on a shot at adding a $20,000 cash prize, which hidden behind only one of three mini doors onstage. The other two doors contained cash amounts of $1,000 or $2,000; however, the $1,000 value was later replaced with a [...] "mystery" [...] amount between $1,000 and $9,000. A trader who decided to play risked their <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> winnings and selected one of the mini doors.

However, if a trader selected one of the other two doors, he or she forfeited the <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> prizes but kept the cash amount behind the door.
