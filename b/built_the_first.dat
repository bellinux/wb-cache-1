5|$|Administrative systems fell {{within the}} hundreds. The Bath Hundred had various names {{including}} the Hundred of LeBuri. The Bath Foreign Hundred or Forinsecum covered the area {{outside the city}} and was later combined into the Bath Forum Hundred. Wealthy merchants had no status within the hundred courts and formed guilds to gain influence. They <b>built</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> guildhall probably in the 13th century. Around 1200 the first mayor was appointed.|$|E

5|$|Born in Newport, Delaware, Evans {{received}} little formal education {{and in his}} mid-teens was apprenticed to a wheelwright. Going into business with his brothers, he worked {{for over a decade}} designing, building and perfecting an automated mill with devices such as bucket chains and conveyor belts. In doing so Evans designed a continuous process of manufacturing that required no human labor. This novel concept would prove critical to the Industrial Revolution and the development of mass production. Later in life Evans turned his attention to steam power, and <b>built</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> high-pressure steam engine in the United States in 1801, developing his design independently of Richard Trevithick, who <b>built</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> in the world a year earlier. Evans was a driving force in the development and adoption of high-pressure steam engines in the United States. Evans dreamed of building a steam-powered wagon and would eventually construct and run one in 1805. Known as the Oruktor Amphibolos, it was the first automobile in the country and the world's first amphibious vehicle, although it was too primitive to be a success as either.|$|E
5|$|Daily life in Mau's {{village on}} Satawal {{involved}} harvesting taro and gathering breadfruit and coconut. The Satawalese people also raised chicken and pork and caught fish, their {{primary source of}} protein. A freshwater pond served as bathing facilities. Local materials were used to construct outrigger canoes called proa. The island's isolation helped preserve the lifestyle of the Satawalese people and Mau's role as a navigator. Even {{with the arrival of}} the Germans (1890) and the Japanese (1914) in Micronesia, Satawalese culture remained intact. American missionaries who arrived after World War II <b>built</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> church and school on Satawal.|$|E
5|$|Fort Lauderdale {{is named}} {{after a series of}} forts built by the United States during the Second Seminole War. The forts took their name from Major William Lauderdale (1782–1838), younger brother of Lieutenant Colonel James Lauderdale. William Lauderdale was the {{commander}} of the detachment of soldiers who <b>built</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> fort. However, development of the city did not begin until 50 years after the forts were abandoned {{at the end of the}} conflict.|$|E

5|$|In 1792, Claude Chappe, a French engineer, <b>built</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> fixed visual {{telegraphy}} system (or semaphore line) between Lille and Paris. However semaphore {{suffered from}} the need for skilled operators and expensive towers at intervals of ten to thirty kilometres (six to nineteen miles). As a result of competition from the electrical telegraph, the last commercial line was abandoned in 1880.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{when the first}} fortification at Longtown was <b>built.</b> <b>The</b> <b>first</b> defences may have been built during either the Iron Age or Roman, or Anglo-Saxon periods, but this remains uncertain. If Roman defences were constructed at the site, it was probably because of a Roman road that may have run nearby, and the defences may well have then been reused {{in the building of}} the current castle, parts of whose earthworks have square, angular corners, similar to those of Roman forts but otherwise unusual in 12th century English castles.|$|E
5|$|John Mordan {{settled on}} Little Fishing Creek in Mount Pleasant Township in the 1790s. He also <b>built</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> sawmill in Mount Pleasant Township on Little Fishing Creek. When {{numerous}} other settlers {{arrived in the}} vicinity of Mordan's mill, the area became known as Mordansville. There was also once an obscure gristmill on an island on the creek. The Catawissa Railroad historically went up the valley of the creek.|$|E

5|$|Problems {{with the}} {{reliability}} of early batches of transistors meant that the machine's {{mean time between failures}} was about 90 minutes, which improved once the more reliable junction transistors became available. The Transistor Computer's design was adopted by the local engineering firm of Metropolitan-Vickers in their Metrovick 950, in which all the circuitry was modified to make use of junction transistors. Six Metrovick 950s were <b>built,</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> completed in 1956. They were successfully deployed within various departments of the company and were in use for about five years.|$|E
5|$|Sieur de La Vérendrye <b>built</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> fur {{trading post}} on the site in 1738, called Fort Rouge. French trading {{continued}} at this site for several decades {{before the arrival of}} the British Hudson's Bay Company after France ceded the territory following its defeat in the Seven Years' War. Many French and later British men who were trappers married First Nations women; their mixed-race children hunted, traded, and lived in the area. They gradually developed as an ethnicity known as the Métis because of sharing a traditional culture.|$|E
5|$|Solar power towers use {{thousands}} of individual sun-tracking mirrors (called heliostats) to reflect solar energy onto a central receiver located {{on top of}} a tall tower. The receiver collects the sun's heat in a heat-transfer fluid that flows through the receiver. The U.S. Department of Energy, with a consortium of utilities and industry, <b>built</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two large-scale, demonstration solar power towers in the desert near Barstow, California.|$|E

She was the second {{battleship}} of the class that shared her name to be <b>built,</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> dreadnoughts of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The keel of Tegetthoff was laid down in Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste on 24 September 1910. Following {{a year and a}} half of construction, Tegetthoff was launched on 21 March 1912. Following her fitting out, she was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian navy on 14 July 1913.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee, United States, {{located on}} the banks of the Mississippi River. The lands of the Mississippi River Basin were {{inhabited}} by Paleo-Indians and later Native American tribes of the Mississippian culture for thousands of years. The Tipton Phase people and the Chickasaw Indian tribe populated the Mississippi River valley near Randolph during the Mississippian period. In 1541, Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto crossed the Mississippi River at or near Randolph. French explorer Cavelier de La Salle <b>built</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> French fortification at or near Randolph on his 1682 canoe expedition of the Mississippi River.|$|E
5|$|The Rock Island Railroad <b>built</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{railroad}} {{bridge across}} the Mississippi River in 1856. It connected Davenport to Rock Island, Illinois. This railway connection resulted in significant improvements to transportation and commerce with Chicago, a booming 19th-century city. The addition of new railroad lines to Muscatine and Iowa City, and the acquisition of other lines by the Rock Island Railroad, resulted in Davenport becoming a commercial railroad hub.|$|E

5|$|The area {{became part}} of the United States {{following}} its conquest during the American Revolutionary War. Veterans of the revolution received land grants {{in the eastern part of}} the county as part of Clark's Grant. Daniel Boone and his brother Squire Boone were early explorers of the county, entering from Kentucky in the 1780s. Harvey Heth, Spier Spencer, and Edward Smith were among the first to settle in the county beginning in the 1790s. Smith <b>built</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> home in what later became the county seat of Corydon.|$|E
5|$|The park, {{previously}} {{known as}} Sitton Gulch (or Gulf) or Trenton Gulf, was purchased in stages {{by the state}} of Georgia beginning in 1938. Under President Franklin D.

Today the park features a variety of campsites, cabins, hiking and recreational activities.|$|E
