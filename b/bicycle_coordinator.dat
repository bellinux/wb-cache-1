40|$|The 1990 s were {{a period}} of {{extraordinary}} change in the U. S. bicycle field. As the deca e began, federal spending on bicycle facilities averaged a few million dollars annually; the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) had no staff working full-time on bicycle issues and no real strategy for dealing with those issues; fewer than 10 states and 25 cities had a <b>bicycle</b> <b>coordinator</b> position, and none had an equivalent pedestrian staff person. The 1990 Pro Bike Conference in Washington, D. C., was attended by fewer than 250 people. Little bicycle-related research had been done {{since the end of}} the 1970 s. As the decade draws to a close, average federal spending on bicycle and pedestrian facilities exceeds $ 260 million annually. U. S. DOT has staff working on bicycle and pedestrian issues in most of its agencies [Office of the Secretary of Transportation, Federa...|$|E
40|$|United States are {{planning}} and implementing bicycle plans, many are encountering opposition from an unexpected source: the transit agency. From Houston, TX, USA, to San Francisco, CA, USA, transit agencies have objected to bike lanes being striped on major bus routes. The basic argument is the conflict that arises when buses must cross the bike lane to load and unload passengers at the curbside bus stops. 1 The {{focus of this}} feature will be on alternative engineering solutions. This feature first outlines the concerns and safety issues when bicyclists use streets that are also heavily used by transit buses. It then describes some specific concerns of bicyclists and buses from each unique perspective. Lastly, it presents a description {{of some of the}} various strategies being used in the United States, Canada and Peru to accommodate bikes and buses on the same street. Where possible, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design is also provided by the respective city’s traffic engineer and/or <b>bicycle</b> <b>coordinator...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a rural bicycle compatibility index (RBCI) is described. A recent Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) research project developed a Bicycle Compatibility Index (BCI). This index was developed for urban and suburban roadway segments and incorporated those variables that bicyclists typically use to assess how compatible a roadway segment is for travel on by bicycle. The FHWA BCI {{can be used by}} <b>bicycle</b> <b>coordinators,</b> transportation planners, traffic engineers, and others to evaluate existing facilities to determine what improvements may be required, as well as the geometric and operational requirements for new facilities to achieve the desired level of bicycle service. No such tool exists for the rating of rural roadway segments, however. The objective of work described in this paper is to develop a rural equivalent of the BCI. Roadways in rural Nebraska were used to develop the RBCI. Although the specific results of this work are clearly applicable to Nebraska and other similar rural areas, the general methodology and concepts could easily be used to develop a more general RBCI that would have national applicability. An RBCI will provide <b>bicycle</b> <b>coordinators,</b> transportation planners, traffic engineers, and others the capability to better plan and design bicycle compatible roadways. Specifically, an RBCI model can be used for operational evaluation, design, and planning. TRB 2003 Annual Meeting CD-ROM Paper revised from original submittal. Jones and Carlson...|$|R
50|$|Each of {{the nine}} {{counties}} in the San Francisco Bay Area has developed a bicycle plan. Except for Marin County, each plan is countywide, meaning it covers both incorporated and unincorporated areas of the county. Marin County's plan only covers the unincorporated areas. Six of the counties fund their bicycle programs with dedicated sales taxes, {{and three of the}} counties have full-time <b>bicycle</b> program <b>coordinators.</b> Details for each of the counties' bicycle plans are summarized in the table below.|$|R
40|$|In Quebec province, cycling {{has been}} growing in {{popularity}} in recent years. Projects such as « La Route Verte » were created so that local authorities could develop and improve their bicycle networks. Decisions must increasingly be taken in rural areas concerning the designation of bicycle routes and associated roadside improvements. However, no tool adapted to Quebec conditions has been developed to identify the most compatible routes for cyclists on the road network. This research aims to build a safety and compatibility index for rural and urban fringe areas, {{using a combination of}} parameters (ex. speed, traffic, and layout). The resulting CRC Index (Compatibility of Roads for Cyclists) is an innovative tool: it allows the evaluation of both existing and potential routes, and of modifications that may be needed. The index is built on the results of a survey to evaluate a variety of rural sites by cyclists, and to understand their perceptions of comfort and safety relative to different elements of bicycle routes and the characteristics of rural roads. This decision-aid tool should be easy to use both by planners and <b>bicycle</b> <b>coordinators.</b> Also, the CRC Index goes further than previous tools using cartographi...|$|R
40|$|Bicycle use has a {{long history}} in Ann Arbor. Until the 1960 s, {{undergraduates}} at the University of Michigan were not allowed to bring cars to campus. Hence the bicycle was a major mode of transportation for them. In the 1970 s, {{as a result of a}} national increase in use, planning professionals started to give more attention to the bicycle as a mode of transportation. At that time Ann Arbor was at the forefront of developments: the City commissioned several relevant studies; one on bicycle parking facilities being the first such study nationally; a <b>bicycle</b> <b>coordinator</b> position was established in 1979. These efforts were recognized by the 1988 Bicycling magazine survey that ranked Ann Arbor in the 6 th position of the 10 most bicycle friendly cities in the US. It seems that by 1988 all "alternative " modes of transport, i. e. anything else apart from driving alone, were used by significant percentages of the population. The 1990 census results demonstrated that as the commute to work statistics showed that 38 to 39 percent of the workers ' commuted by "alternative" modes...|$|E
40|$|Shared-use paths are {{designed}} for both transportation and recreation purposes and are used by pedestrians, bicyclists, skaters, equestrians, and other users. Some common locations for shared-use paths are along rivers, streams, ocean beachfronts, canals, utility rights of way, and abandoned railroad rights of way; within college campuses; and within and between parks as well as within existing roadway corridors. A common application is to use shared-use paths to close gaps in bicycle networks. There might also be situations where such facilities can be provided as part of planned developments. Where a shareduse path is designed to parallel a roadway, provide a separation between the path and the vehicular traveled way in accordance with this chapter. As with any roadway project, shared-use path projects need {{to fit into the}} context of a multimodal community. Exhibits are provided throughout this chapter to illustrate possible design solutions, which should be treated with appropriate flexibility as long as doing so complies with corresponding laws, regulations, standards, and guidance.

40|$|Examining committee: Yizhao Yang, chair, Marc Schlossberg, Brianna OrrCollege {{communities}} are increasingly finding bicycles {{to be the}} answer to greater mobility for their active lifestyles, while on a budget, and with {{the future of the}} environment in mind. The cost of parking, growth of bicycle commuting (over 50 % mode split at some universities), and its acceptance as a sustainable practice has led to the establishment of campus programs. As of fall 2013, the League of American Bicyclists has recognized 75 schools as Bicycle Friendly Universities. Several previous studies have examined the physical attributes that determine college bicycling behaviors, including infrastructure and weather preferences. However, there has been little research into the organizational structures that support bicycle services. If bicycling is growing, and it is generally accepted as a clean and cost-efficient alternative, then why haven’t more colleges made the modal shift away from single occupancy vehicles through the establishment of comprehensive bicycle programs? What are the institutional barriers to college campus bicycle program development? This research involved interviewing <b>bicycle</b> program <b>coordinators</b> at universities across the country recognized for their bicycle services, to give voice to their triumphs and challenges. The findings from these interviews help explain the institutional culture that may inhibit further programmatic growth, as well as the strategies that have met with success. Together, these insights from current <b>bicycle</b> program <b>coordinators</b> could contribute to the dialogue surrounding organizational credibility for alternative and sustainable practices, such as campus bicycling...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This {{research}} {{aimed to}} assess the level of support for active transportation among state departments of transportation (DOTs) in the U. S. Methods: We conducted an inventory plans adopted by 51 state DOTs and a survey of state DOT pedestrian and <b>bicycle</b> <b>coordinators</b> in the U. S. in 2010 (n= 39, 72 % response rate). Results: Overall, the plans were not very encouraging of planning and design elements that would encourage walking and bicycling. Only two items (Establish pedestrian and bicycle facilities requirements and standards and Safer intersections for pedestrians and bicyclists) were encouraged or required by {{at least half of}} the states. States were more supportive of including bicycle and pedestrian facilities (e. g. trails, sidewalks, and bike lanes) and less supportive of policies related to land use and urban design and reallocating road space (e. g. road diets or narrower streets). The overall levels of support were positively correlated to levels of urbanization. According to the state <b>coordinators,</b> support for <b>bicycle</b> and pedestrian projects and policies increased over time, but support is stronger among top management than highway engineering staff. Funding was identified as the major implementation barrier, particularly in more rural states. Conclusions: Change within state DOTs to incorporate bicycle and pedestrian modes is a slow process, influenced by both management and engineering staff. Education at several levels and through different mechanisms could play an important role in changing DOT culture, though funding for projects is also a major barrier. Effective advocacy groups may also play a positive role...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety Research Program {{activities}} {{have supported the}} congressionally mandated National Bicycle and Walking Study's goals of doubling the percentage of walking and bicycling trips and reducing by 10 percent the number of bicyclists and pedestrians killed or injured in traffic crashes. The FHWA's Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety Research Program has {{and will continue to}} focus on identifying problem areas for pedestrians and bicyclists, developing analysis tools for planners and engineers to target these problem areas, and evaluating countermeasures to reduce crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists. There is a variety of on- and off-road bicycle facilities- each with its advantages and disadvantages. A thorough evaluation of the various kinds of facilities implemented in pro-bicycling communities has been needed by the transportation engineering profession. As part of the Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety Research Program, evaluations of some innovative treatments to accommodate bicyclists were conducted. Many European cities use colored markings at bicycle-motor vehicle crossing to reduce conflicts. This report documents the evaluation of an application of a blue bike lane treatment to reduce bicycle-motor vehicle conflicts in Portland, Oregon. The information contained in this document should be of interest to State and local <b>bicycle</b> and pedestrian <b>coordinators</b> and to transportation professionals involved in safety and risk management.
