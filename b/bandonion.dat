50|$|A Chemnitzer {{concertina}} is {{a musical}} instrument of the hand-held bellows-driven free-reed category, sometimes called squeezeboxes. The Chemnitzer concertina is most {{closely related to the}} bandoneón (German spelling: <b>Bandonion),</b> more distantly to the other concertinas, and accordions.|$|E
50|$|The bandoneon (or <b>bandonion,</b> bandoneón) {{is a type}} of {{concertina}} {{particularly popular}} in Argentina, Uruguay, and Lithuania. It is an essential instrument in most tango ensembles from the traditional orquesta típica of the 1910s onwards, and in folk music ensembles of Lithuania.|$|E
50|$|Uhlig's first {{instrument}} {{had five}} buttons on each side, but the keyboard was quickly expanded {{and as it}} did so, it diverged into different lineages. Heinrich Band's was sold under the name <b>Bandonion.</b> Several other German instruments were sold under the name concertina (or konzertina), and their keyboard systems were given names based on their creators, as with Band and Scheffler, or their city of origin, as with the Carlsfelder and Chemnitzer systems.|$|E
50|$|Strictly speaking, the Chemnitzer layout {{is one of}} 38, 39, 51 or 52 buttons, {{or one of the}} American {{expanded}} {{versions of}} the 52-button system. Especially in English-speaking countries, the term Chemnitzer is frequently applied to any of the square German concertinas that are not <b>bandonions.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{concertina}} {{was popular}} throughout the 19th century. The Salvation Army in England, America, Australia, and New Zealand commonly used concertinas in their bands, and other concertina bands and musicians performed {{in all parts}} of the English speaking world. German emigrants carried their Chemnizters and <b>bandonions</b> with them to the United States and Argentina where they were regionally popular. In England, America, and Australia the concertina became nearly ubiquitous.|$|R
50|$|The bandoneon (also {{rendered}} bandoneón, <b>bandonion)</b> is a German concertina {{system with}} an original bisonoric layout devised by Heinrich Band. Although {{intended as a}} substitute for the organ in small churches and chapels, it was soon secularized and is now associated with tango music, due to the instrument's popularity in Argentina in the late 19th century when tango developed from various dance styles in Argentina and Uruguay. Though the typical bandoneon is bisonoric, the 1920s saw the development of unisonoric variants such as the Ernst Kusserow and Charles Peguri systems, both introduced around 1925. Bandoneons typically have more than one reed per button, dry-tuned with the reeds an octave apart. Ástor Piazzolla {{was one of the most}} famous exponents of this instrument.|$|E
50|$|In the 1850s, the Anglo-German concertina's {{ability to}} play both melody and accompaniment led English {{manufacturers}} to start developing the various Duet systems. The popular Maccann system were developed {{towards the end of}} the century. Meanwhile, German manufacturers were producing concertinas with more than 20 buttons for local sale. Three keyboard systems for German concertinas eventually became popular: Uhlig's Chemnitzer system, Carl Zimmerman's Carlsfeld system, and the Bandonion's Reinische system. Various German manufacturers tried to develop a single unified keyboard system for all German concertinas—but this was only partially accomplished at the end of the 19th century, when the Chemnitzer and Carlsfelder systems merged into the unified concertina system, and a unified <b>bandonion</b> system was created. Despite the new standards, the older systems remained popular into the 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, this {{popularity}} rapidly began to decline. Reasons included growing relative {{popularity of the}} accordion, mass production of other instruments such as the piano, increasingly chromatic and less tonal forms of music such as blues and jazz, and the overall decline of amateur musical performance due to radio and the phonograph. By {{the middle of the}} century, few concertina makers remained, and most of those used accordion reeds and inexpensive, unreliable button mechanisms. Yet, the various forms of concertina survived in some areas: Anglo concertinas in Irish traditional music, the English and the Anglo in English Morris dancing, the Anglo in Africa, among Afrikaners (see Boer music) and Zulus (who call it a [...] "squashbox"), the Chemnitzer in the United States as a polka instrument, and the [...] "bandoneón" [...] in Argentina as a prominent part of the tango tradition. Between World War I and World War II, there were many concertina and <b>bandonion</b> bands in Germany, but with the rise of the Nazi regime these musical clubs disappeared.|$|E
