60|$|We {{obtain a}} pretty {{distinct}} {{idea of the}} nature of this pastoral life, and of the manners and customs, and the domestic constitution to which it gives rise, in the accounts given us in the Old Testament of Abraham and Lot, and of their wanderings with their flocks and herds over the country lying between the Euphrates and the Mediterranean Sea. They lived in tents, in order that they might remove their habitations the more easily from place to place in following their flocks and herds to different pasture-grounds. Their wealth consisted almost wholly in these flocks and herds, the land being almost every where common. Sometimes, when two parties traveling together came to a fertile and well-watered district, their herdsmen and followers were disposed to contend for the privilege of feeding their flocks upon it, and the contention would often lead to a quarrel and combat, {{if it had not been}} settled <b>by</b> an <b>amicable</b> <b>agreement</b> on the part of the chieftains.|$|R
30|$|<b>Amicable</b> <b>agreements</b> (redemptions) are {{somewhat}} different to so-called ’cured’ {{cases that have}} recently been discussed in the default prediction literature (e.g., Tong et al. 2012; Wolter and Rösch 2014). While ’cured’ cases always show a 100  % recovery (see Wolter and Rösch 2014 for a brief introduction to ’cured’ events), <b>amicable</b> <b>agreements</b> do not necessarily lead to a full recovery (the average recovery rate for <b>amicable</b> <b>agreements</b> in our sample is 82  %; see Table 1).|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, {{we control}} {{for the type of}} workout-process. If there is an <b>amicable</b> <b>agreement</b> between BAG and the debtor, all {{collateral}} from the debtor is released. If there is no <b>amicable</b> <b>agreement,</b> the collateral is liquidated. First, collateral in real estate is offered by a regional real estate agent mandated by BAG. If a buyer can be found, the property is sold in an over-the-counter trade OTC. If the debtor is not willing to cooperate or another creditor denies his consent and an over-the-counter trade is not possible, BAG initiates a foreclosure auction. The disposal of the property in a foreclosure auction is displayed with the binary variable FO. At 92  %, the proceeds ratio for over-the-counter trades is significantly higher than the proceeds ratio for foreclosure auctions (71  %).|$|R
30|$|Since {{there is}} no {{restructuring}} for the debtors in our data set, we only differentiate between an <b>amicable</b> <b>agreement</b> and a liquidation to assess Hypothesis H 3. The binary variable redemption (RED) takes a value of 1 if an <b>amicable</b> <b>agreement</b> between BAG and the debtor was reached. The portion of redemptions in our data set amounts to 40  % (195 out of 499 cases). This proportion {{is consistent with the}} survey results of Hesse et al. (2012) for cooperative banks and savings banks in Germany regarding problem loans. According to their 171 responses, the average proportion of redemptions equals 34  %. Grippa et al. (2005) report a fraction of 41  % of such private agreements between debtors and banks for an Italian sample and find for these cases a considerably higher recovery rate of 68  % compared to their overall average of 37  %.|$|R
30|$|We split {{our sample}} in a further {{robustness}} check {{among the two}} different workout types liquidation and redemption. Table 17 in the Appendix shows {{the results of the}} regressions [Models (13 a) and (13 b) for the liquidations, again divided into the two customer types, and Models (14 a) and (14 b) for the redemptions]. Sign and statistical significance of the collateralization ratio are confirmed in all models. It is noticeable that the status of bankruptcy (INS) has a significant negative influence on the recovery rate for both customer types only {{in the case of an}} <b>amicable</b> <b>agreement.</b> An insolvency in conjunction with an <b>amicable</b> <b>agreement</b> is only observed for nine customers (three retail and six commercial customers) in our sample. The reliability of this particular result is, therefore, debatable. Nevertheless, all other results are qualitatively unchanged. We, therefore, consider the joint analyses of the two workout types to be appropriate.|$|R

40|$|Many couples do {{not sign}} prenuptial agreements, {{even though this}} often leads to costly and inefficient {{litigation}} in case of divorce.

Moreover, the threat of costly divorce is credible since the lack of an ex-ante agreement leads to a moral hazard problem within the couple, which induces partners to reject any ex-post <b>amicable</b> <b>agreement.</b> symmetric information, incomplete contracts, prenuptial agreement. ...|$|R
