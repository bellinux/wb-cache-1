40|$|AbstractThe 17 CrNiMo 6 {{steel is}} mainly {{used for the}} <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> of large modulus in many fields of heavy {{industry}} such as mining, transit, hoist, forging and so on[1]. The size of addendum circle and common normal line is changed a lot beyond the tolerance because of the long time of carburizing process and the out-of-step structural stress and thermal stress during the quenching process. And thus the posterior grinding efficiency and quality are influenced. In the paper comparison {{and analysis of the}} deformation affected by solid and hollow <b>gear</b> <b>shafts</b> were done and the methods of simulation and practice were both used. The results are as follows: the deformation of <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> was small before and after carburizing while that of <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> was large before and after quenching because of different cooling velocity, structure and hardness of each position. And the deformation of hollow was much smaller than that of solid. Therefore, if the hollow <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> is used, the waste of material will be decreased, and finishing cost will be reduced, and thus the technology of heat treatment will be optimized...|$|R

Lastly, a larger petri dish, having a central recess (4  mm), with an externally attached electric motor, was reversely installed above to form the upper compartment.

40|$|Abstract. This paper takes a helical <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> as {{research}} subject and discusses the main structural parameters {{to see how}} it would affect natural frequency sensitivity. The parametrical model of helical <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> is created by using software PROE 3. 0. The natural frequencies and vibration shapes are calculated by the modal analysis. The relationship between the structural parameters and the natural frequency sensitivity can be obtained by means of ANSYS. The result shows that the structural parameters can affect the natural frequency sensitivity. The variation in low order natural frequency is similar to that in high order natural frequency. The effect of module on the natural frequency sensitivity is more remarkable comparing with pressure angle, modification coefficient and helical angle. Selecting structural parameters reasonably may reduce vibration and noise of the helical <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> effectively...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} laboratory tests that {{were aimed at}} detecting early stages of various faults in toothed wheels by measurement and analysis of transverse vibration speed of the transmission <b>gear</b> <b>shafts.</b> In experimental investigation, cracking of the root tooth and chipping of the tooth were detected. The laser vibrometer Ometron VH 300 + was used for non-contact measurement of shaft transversal vibration speed. Gear vibrations were recorded in selected points of gear housing and <b>gear</b> <b>shafts</b> at different speeds and gear loads. Results were analyzed and compared but in this paper is presented only selected examples. This paper shows that {{on the basis of}} the transverse vibration speed of transmission <b>gear</b> <b>shafts,</b> it is possible to detect defects at an earlier stage than {{on the basis of the}} housing vibration accelerations. In the case of measuring <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> vibration velocity, the way of the signal generated by the defect of a gear wheel (or bearing) is shortened as well as the influence of composed transmittance of the bearing-gear housing system is eliminated. WV time-frequency analysis and complex continuous wavelet transformations were used for detection.

The results of research presented in this paperconfirmed that the defect's measure is very sensitive to the development of teeth faults...|$|R
