40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the application of}} the active infrared thermography to detect damage in bonding between concrete and glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP). Specimens of concrete and mortar with GFRP externally bonded were prepared and at their interfaces were inserted polystyrene discs to simulate damages. The samples were divided into two groups. In group 1, one sample was correctly bonded by a GFRP plate to the concrete, but in the other three were inserted polystyrene discs which had different diameters to simulate damages in bonding. In group 2, all of the samples contained identical polystyrene discs at their interfaces, but the total thickness of each specimen was different, because the objective was to evaluate the ability of the camera to capture the simulated damage in depth. The experimental procedure was divided into two stages. In the first stage, four types of heating were used to heat samples of group 1 : incandescent lamp, kiln, <b>blended</b> <b>lamp</b> and fan heater. Thus, it was possible to detect the damage and to observe its format and length. It was noticed that the infrared images are different depending on the heat source incident on the specimen. Therefore, group 2 was tested only for the more efficient heating (incandescent lamp). In the second stage, the infrared equipment was tested. Some of the parameters that must be inserted in the camera were varied in order to understand their influence on image formation. The results show the effectiveness of infrared thermography to assess adherence in GFRP/concrete interface. In the present work, the best results were obtained when the image is captured towards GFRP/concrete and using incandescent lamp. It was observed that the image and measured temperature suffer significant distortion when a false value was inserted for the parameter emissivity...|$|E
40|$|Spectral {{output of}} {{fluorescent}} lamps can be precisely adjusted by using computer-assisted analysis for custom <b>blending</b> <b>lamp</b> phosphors. With technique, spectrum of main bank of lamps is measured {{and stored in}} computer memory along with emission characteristics of commonly available phosphors. Computer then calculates ratio of green and blue intensities for each phosphor according to manufacturer's specifications and plots them as coordinates on graph. Same ratios are calculated for measured spectrum. Once proper mix is determined, it is applied as coating to fluorescent tubing...|$|R
30|$|The light {{fastness}} of the dyed wool yarn samples {{was conducted on}} Digi light NxTM, having water-cooled Mercury <b>Blended</b> Tungsten <b>lamp</b> as per test method AATCC 16 e- 2004 similar to ISO 105 -B 02 : 1994 (Amd. 2 : 2000), which has the nearest approach {{to that of the}} sunlight. Light fastness ratings have been done on 1 – 8 scale as per ISO 105 -B 02 : 1994 (Amd. 2 : 2000).|$|R
30|$|Degradation of Congo red dye {{was carried}} out to {{evaluate}} the photocatalytic and photo-Fenton oxidation characterization of natural chromite mineral. Congo red dye was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Company, Egypt. Sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid were used for modifying the pH of the solutions. Hydrogen peroxide 30 % w/v {{was used as an}} oxidant to enhance the degradation of Congo red dye. The degradation experiments were conducted under artificial visible light irradiations <b>lamp</b> (<b>blended</b> metal halide <b>lamp</b> 400  W). The experiments were performed as a function of illumination time, chromite dose, the initial concentration of dye and pH, either in {{the presence or absence of}} H 2 O 2. All the photocatalytic degradation tests were performed after adsorption–desorption equilibrium of Congo red dye using chromite.|$|R
30|$|Light {{fastness}} of the dyed samples {{was conducted}} on Digi light Nx™, having water cooled by Mercury <b>Blended</b> Tungsten <b>lamp,</b> according to test method ISO 105 -B 02 : 1994 (Amd. 2 : 2000). Wash fastness was measured in Digi wash SS™ (Laundrometer) as per the ISO 105 -C 06 : 1994 (2010) specifications. Dry and wet rub fastness of dyed samples were tested using Digi crock™ (Crockmeter) as per Indian standard IS 766 : 1988 (reaffirmed 2004) based on ISO 105 -X 12 : 2001 by mounting the fabric on a panel and giving ten strokes for {{both dry and wet}} rub fastness tests. The samples were assessed for staining on white adjacent fabric (cotton and wool).|$|R

30|$|The light {{fastness}} of dyed woolen yarn samples {{were conducted on}} digi light NxTM having water cooled Mercury <b>Blended</b> Tungsten <b>lamp</b> as per test method AATCC 16 E- 1993 (2004) similar to ISO 105 -B 02 : 1994 (Amd. 2 : 2000). The wash fastness of dyed woolen yarn samples was measured in Launder-o-meter as per the ISO 105 -C 06 : 1994 (2010) specifications. Dry and wet rub fastness of the dyed woolen yarn samples were tested using a Crock-meter as per Indian standard IS 766 : 1988 (Reaffirmed 2004) based on ISO 105 -X 12 : 2001 by mounting the fabric on panel and giving ten strokes for dry and wet rub fastness tests.

5000|$|Fluorescent lamps work {{by passing}} {{electricity}} through mercury vapor, {{which in turn}} emits ultraviolet light. The ultraviolet light is then absorbed by a phosphor coating inside the lamp, causing it to glow, or fluoresce. Conventional linear fluorescent lamps have life spans around 20,000 and 30,000 hours based on 3 hours per cycle according to lamps NLPIP reviewed in 2006. Induction fluorescent relies on electromagnetism rather than the cathodes used to start conventional linear fluorescent. The newer rare earth triphosphor <b>blend</b> linear fluorescent <b>lamps</b> made by Osram, Philips, Crompton and others have a life expectancy greater than 40,000 hours, if coupled with a warm-start electronic ballast. The life expectancy depends {{on the number of}} on/off cycles, and is lower if the light is cycled often. The ballast-lamp combined system efficacy for then current linear fluorescent systems in 1998 as tested by NLPIP ranged from 80 to 90 lm/W.|$|R
