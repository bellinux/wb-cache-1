5|$|After {{pitching}} out of {{the bullpen}} while <b>bouncing</b> <b>back</b> and forth between Texas and its Triple-A affiliate in 2005–07, Feldman converted to a starter in 2008. He established himself in 2009 with a breakout season for the Rangers. He was 17–8, tied for 4th in the American League in wins, and tied the major league record with 12 victories on the road.|$|E
5|$|Considering {{the notion}} that positrons were {{electrons}} that were traveling backwards in time, he came up in 1940 with his one-electron universe postulate: that there was in fact only one electron, <b>bouncing</b> <b>back</b> and forth in time. His graduate student, Richard Feynman, found this hard to believe, {{but the idea that}} positrons were electrons traveling backwards in time intrigued him and Feynman incorporated the notion of the reversibility of time into his Feynman diagrams.|$|E
5|$|Some of the charged {{particles}} do {{get into the}} magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, <b>bouncing</b> <b>back</b> {{and forth between the}} poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a ring current. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface. Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the lights of the aurorae and also emit X-rays.|$|E

5|$|<b>Bouncing</b> <b>back,</b> Buffalo {{won their}} next five games. Against Army, Buffalo {{reversed}} {{the result of}} the Western Michigan game, coming back from a two-touchdown deficit to win in overtime. Handling conference opponents Ohio and Miami (Ohio) with relative ease, Buffalo continued conference play by beating Akron in a four-hour, four-overtime slugfest, 43–40, in Akron's final football game at the Rubber Bowl. In their next game, against Bowling Green, the Bulls found themselves down 21–0 midway through the third quarter, but still managed to come back for their third overtime win of the season. With the win, Buffalo clinched the MAC East championship and ensured that they would have their first winning regular season since moving to Division I-A; the final regular season game, a 24–21 loss to Kent State, was only a formality. The Bulls finished the regular season with an overall record of 7–5, 5–3 within the conference.|$|E

25|$|Echo {{sounding}} is {{a process}} {{used to determine the}} depth of water beneath ships and boats. A type of active sonar, echo sounding is the transmission of an acoustic pulse directly downwards to the seabed, measuring the time between transmission and echo return, after having hit the bottom and <b>bouncing</b> <b>back</b> to its ship of origin. The acoustic pulse is emitted by a transducer which receives the return echo as well. The depth measurement is calculated by multiplying the speed of sound in water(averaging 1,500 meters per second) by the time between emission and echo return.|$|E
25|$|Kirchhoff in 1860 {{introduced}} the theoretical {{concept of a}} perfect black body with a completely absorbing surface layer of infinitely small thickness, but Planck noted some severe restrictions upon this idea. Planck noted three requirements upon a black body: the body must (i) allow radiation to enter but not reflect; (ii) possess a minimum thickness adequate to absorb the incident radiation and prevent its re-emission; (iii) satisfy severe limitations upon scattering to prevent radiation from entering and <b>bouncing</b> <b>back</b> out. As a consequence, Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies that absorb all the radiation that falls on them cannot be realized in an infinitely thin surface layer, and impose conditions upon scattering of the light within the black body {{that are difficult to}} satisfy.|$|E
25|$|When light {{traveling}} in an optically dense medium hits a boundary at a steep angle (larger than the critical angle for the boundary), {{the light is}} completely reflected. This is called total internal reflection. This effect is used in optical fibers to confine light in the core. Light travels through the fiber core, <b>bouncing</b> <b>back</b> and forth off {{the boundary between the}} core and cladding. Because the light must strike the boundary with an angle greater than the critical angle, only light that enters the fiber within a certain range of angles can travel down the fiber without leaking out. This range of angles is called the acceptance cone of the fiber. The size of this acceptance cone {{is a function of the}} refractive index difference between the fiber's core and cladding.|$|E

25|$|Early in the 2008–09 season, the Penguins and Red Wings met for {{the first}} time since the Stanley Cup series on November 11, 2008. With the Penguins down by three goals in the third period, Staal notched his second career NHL hat trick to tie the game, then set up Ruslan Fedotenko's {{overtime}} winner to defeat the Red Wings 7–6. On December 2, 2008, he was named to the rotating position of alternate captain for the Penguins for the month of December. The following month, on January 8, 2009, the Penguins announced that they had extended Staal's contract through the 2012–13 season. Terms of the contract were for $16 million, payable as $3.5 million for the first two seasons, and then $4.5 million for the last two years, resulting in a $4 million salary cap hit. He completed the season <b>bouncing</b> <b>back</b> from the decreased production of his sophomore year with a career-high 27 assists and 49 points.|$|E
25|$|The Ravens got on {{the board}} first when Matt Stover kicked a 24-yard field goal, {{following}} a fumble by Broncos RB Tatum Bell. The Broncos responded with a 43-yard field goal of their own by Jason Elam. The Ravens drove deep into Broncos territory late {{at the end of}} the first half, but that drive was thwarted as Steve McNair was intercepted by Champ Bailey in the end zone on a pass intended for Clarence Moore. The third quarter saw no points scored by either team as the defensive struggle continued. The Broncos controlled the clock in the second half with the running game led by Tatum Bell, who atoned for his fumble in the first quarter, by <b>bouncing</b> <b>back</b> with 92 yards rushing. Ravens QB McNair was intercepted again by Darrent Williams, which led to a Jake Plummer to Rod Smith touchdown pass. McNair was intercepted a third time, ending the Ravens' final drive, this time by Domonique Foxworth. With their first loss, the Ravens dropped to 4–1.|$|E
25|$|Li Na has had {{a memorable}} yet very {{inconsistent}} year.

However, she lost her next 4 matches before <b>bouncing</b> <b>back</b> in the European clay season, reaching the semifinals of the Mutua Madrid Open and Internazionali BNL d'Italia. Li then won her first Grand Slam title and became the first Grand Slam singles champion born in an Asian country at the French Open, defeating defending champion Francesca Schiavone 6–4, 7–6(7–0) in the final. Following her French Open victory, she has had disappointing results {{for the rest of the}} year with the 5–7 record, including the second round lost at Wimbledon to Sabine Lisicki 6–3, 4–6, 6–8 and the first round defeat from Simona Halep 6–2, 7–5 at the US Open.

25|$|Afterwards, {{during the}} off-season, Luc Robitaille {{turned down a}} one-year deal with a {{substantial}} pay cut and ended up signing with Detroit, as the Red Wings represented his best chance at winning the Stanley Cup, and like Tomas Sandstrom before him in 1997, Robitaille won the Stanley Cup with Detroit in 2002. The Kings started off {{the season with a}} sluggish October and November, and then found their game again to finish with 95 points. They in fact were tied in points with the second place Phoenix Coyotes, and only finished third in the Pacific Division and seventh in the West due to a goals-for differential—the Coyotes having 228 and the Kings having 214 as a team. In the playoffs they met the Colorado Avalanche once again, this time in the first round. The series would prove to be a carbon copy of their previous meeting, with the Kings behind three games to one and <b>bouncing</b> <b>back</b> to tie the series, only to be dominated in the seventh game and eliminated. The next seasons would be major disappointments as the Kings hit another major decline, missing the post-season up until the 2009–10 season.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} March, saw Yeovil confirm {{the signing of}} Northern Irish {{international}} midfielder Tommy Doherty on loan from Queens Park Rangers on a one-month loan deal, while Stephen Reed joined Torquay United on loan {{until the end of}} the season. A hat-trick from Welsh attacking midfielder Arron Davies earned Yeovil a 3–0 victory away at Chesterfield, on 4 March, to record their first win in seven matches and move out of the relegation zone. The Chesterfield match though saw Yeovil suffer injuries to both Doherty and Anthony Barry who was ruled out for the rest of the season with a dislocated knee. After an injury to Chris Weale, Francisco Ramos returned to the club as goalkeeper cover for the club's trip to Brentford, but Yeovil lost the match 2–1. In an attempt to ease the club's injury crisis, Yeovil signed Irish midfielder Marc Wilson on loan from Portsmouth for a month and goalkeeper Michael Jordan on loan from Arsenal {{until the end of the}} season. On 11 March, Yeovil drew 0–0 with relegation rivals Swindon Town, in the week following the match the club confirmed that James Vincent had joined Millwall on loan until the end of the season. While club record signing Pablo Bastianini had left the club after having his contract terminated by mutual consent. On 18 March, Yeovil suffered a 1–0 defeat away at Bournemouth, before <b>bouncing</b> <b>back</b> with a comfortable 2–0 victory over Walsall with goals from Matt Harrold and Arron Davies. On 23 March, Yeovil completed the loan signings of Craig Rocastle from Sheffield Wednesday and midfielder Sam Alsop from Birmingham City. Yeovil ended March with a 2–2 draw against Tranmere Rovers after twice having the lead courtesy of Matt Harrold.|$|E
25|$|The 1989 season {{started with}} a deal that sent Jim McMahon to the San Diego Chargers. The move was made as McMahon fell out of favor with Mike Ditka and the Bears front office with his {{behavior}} and repeated injuries. This gave the starting job to Mike Tomczak, who had already seen considerable playing time as McMahon regularly missed games due to various injuries. The change at quarterback did not help the Bears as they finished 6–10 missing a sixth consecutive division title. The Bears came into the 1990 season <b>bouncing</b> <b>back</b> from a 6–10 season to finish in 1st Place with an 11–5 record. During the season, Head Coach Mike Ditka earned legendary status when he coached the team again just 10 days after a heart attack. This incident had been referenced and used several times in Bill Swerski's Superfans. However, {{a change in the}} playoff system caused the Bears a three seed to play in a wild card game to get to the Divisional Playoffs. In the first ever NFC 3 vs. 6 game the Bears defeated the New Orleans Saints, 16–6, to advance to a Divisional Playoff showdown against the New York Giants. The Bears were trounced 31–3 by the eventual Super Bowl Champion. The Bears made a return trip to the playoffs in 1991 with an 11–5 record in a season that saw Mike Ditka earn his 100th career-coaching win. The Bears did not win the division, but made the playoffs as a Wild Card qualifier. In the wild card round the Bears were defeated by the Dallas Cowboys, 17–13, in Chicago. The 1992 season saw {{the end of an era}} in Chicago. The Bears suffered their worst record of Mike Ditka's tenure, finishing 5–11. As a result, the Mike Ditka era ended as team president Mike McCaskey fired Ditka and hired Dave Wannstedt. Another era that ended that season came with the retirement of Hall of Famer Mike Singletary, who was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year.|$|E
