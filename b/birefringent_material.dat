25|$|When an {{arbitrary}} {{beam of light}} strikes {{the surface of a}} <b>birefringent</b> <b>material,</b> the polarizations corresponding to the ordinary and extraordinary rays generally take somewhat different paths. Unpolarized light consists of equal amounts of energy in any two orthogonal polarizations, and even polarized light (except in special cases) will have some energy in each of these polarizations. According to Snell's law of refraction, the angle of refraction will be governed by the effective refractive index which is different between these two polarizations. This is clearly seen, for instance, in the Wollaston prism which is designed to separate incoming light into two linear polarizations using a <b>birefringent</b> <b>material</b> such as calcite.|$|E
25|$|Waveplates are {{constructed}} {{out of a}} <b>birefringent</b> <b>material</b> (such as quartz or mica), for which the index of refraction is different for different orientations of light passing through it. The behavior of a waveplate (that is, {{whether it is a}} half-wave plate, a quarter-wave plate, etc.) depends on the thickness of the crystal, the wavelength of light, and the variation of the index of refraction. By appropriate choice of the relationship between these parameters, it is possible to introduce a controlled phase shift between the two polarization components of a light wave, thereby altering its polarization.|$|E
25|$|In {{birefringent}} media {{there is}} no attenuation but two modes accrue a differential phase delay. Well known manifestations of linear birefringence (that is, in which the basis polarizations are orthogonal linear polarizations) appear in optical wave plates/retarders and many crystals. If linearly polarized light passes through a <b>birefringent</b> <b>material,</b> its state of polarization will generally change unless its polarization direction is identical {{to one of those}} basis polarizations. Since the phase shift, and thus the change in polarization state, is usually wavelength dependent, such objects viewed under white light in between two polarizers may give rise to colorful effects, as seen in the accompanying photograph.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A simple {{achromatic}} retarder made of two {{plates of}} different <b>birefringent</b> <b>materials</b> {{can only be}} used over a limited range of wavelengths. One way to overcome this limitation is by {{using a combination of}} three such achromatic retarders. However, such a combination has the drawback that the orientation of its principal axis varies with the wavelength. An alternative method that is free from this drawback is to use a combination of three plates of different <b>birefringent</b> <b>materials.</b> This paper shows how this method of achromatization can be extended and presents a systematic design procedure for a superachromatic retarder using four plates of different <b>birefringent</b> <b>materials</b> giving an almost constant retardation over a very wide wavelength range...|$|R

25|$|In a <b>birefringent</b> <b>material,</b> a wave {{consists}} of two polarization components which generally are governed by different effective refractive indices. The so-called slow ray is the component for which the material has the higher effective refractive index (slower phase velocity), while the fast ray is the one with a lower effective refractive index. When a beam is incident on such a material from air (or any material with a lower refractive index), the slow ray is thus refracted more towards the normal than the fast ray. In the figure {{at the top of}} the page, it can be seen that refracted ray with s polarization in the direction of the optic axis (thus the extraordinary ray) is the slow ray in this case.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{quarter-wave plate}} {{is made of}} a <b>birefringent</b> <b>material,</b> when in the wave plate, the light travels at {{different}} speeds depending on the direction of its electric field. This means that the horizontal component which is along the slow axis of the wave plate will travel at a slower speed than the component that is directed along the vertical fast axis. Initially the two components are in phase, but as the two components travel through the wave plate the horizontal component of the light drifts farther behind that of the vertical. By adjusting {{the thickness of the}} wave plate one can control how much the horizontal component is delayed relative to vertical component before the light leaves the wave plate and they begin again to travel at the same speed. When the light leaves the quarter-wave plate the rightward horizontal component will be exactly one quarter of a wavelength behind the vertical component making the light left-hand circularly polarized when viewed from the receiver.|$|E
25|$|A {{general state}} of {{polarization}} launched into the medium {{can always be}} decomposed into two waves, one {{in each of those}} two polarizations, which will then propagate with different wavenumbers |k|. Applying the different phase of propagation to those two waves over a specified propagation distance will result in a generally different net polarization state at that point; this is the principle of the waveplate for instance. However, when you have a wave launched into a <b>birefringent</b> <b>material</b> at non-normal incidence, the problem is yet more complicated since the two polarization components will now not only have distinct wavenumbers but the k vectors will not even be in exactly the same direction (see figure {{at the top of the}} page). In this case the two k vectors are rather solutions of eqn. 6 constrained by the boundary condition which requires that the components of the two transmitted waves' k vectors, and the k vector of the incident wave, as projected onto the surface of the interface must all be identical.|$|E
40|$|The {{caustics}} {{formed from}} reflections {{from the rear}} faces of <b>birefringent</b> <b>materials</b> were shown to be twinned because of the optical anisotropy of the reflecting plates. An improved method for evaluating the stress intensity factor in the neighbourhood of a crack tip is developed, considering the first two terms of both complex Muskhelishvili potential functions describing stress fields in <b>birefringent</b> <b>materials</b> and their particular interrelations due to anisotropy. This approximation gives an accurate definition of the geminated caustics engendered by the refraction of the light rays from initial curves in the neighbourhood of the crack tip. It was shown that {{as the amount of}} anisotropy is increased the shapes of the initial curves cease to remain quasi-circular whereas the respective caustics are doubled and distorted.

2500|$|Birefringence is {{responsible}} for the phenomenon of double refraction whereby a ray of light, when incident upon a <b>birefringent</b> <b>material,</b> is split by polarization into two rays taking slightly different paths. This effect was first described by the Danish scientist Rasmus Bartholin in 1669, who observed it [...] in calcite, a crystal having one of the strongest birefringences. However {{it was not until the}} 19th century that Augustin-Jean Fresnel described the phenomenon in terms of polarization, understanding light as a wave with field components in transverse polarizations (perpendicular to the direction of the wave vector).|$|E
2500|$|Isotropic solids do not exhibit birefringence. However, {{when they}} are under {{mechanical}} stress, birefringence results. The stress can be applied externally or is [...] "frozen in" [...] after a birefringent plastic ware is cooled after it is manufactured using injection molding. When such a sample is placed between two crossed polarizers, colour patterns can be observed, because polarization of a light ray is rotated after passing through a <b>birefringent</b> <b>material</b> {{and the amount of}} rotation is dependent on wavelength. The experimental method called photoelasticity used for analyzing stress distribution in solids is based on the same principle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{different}} angles of refraction {{for the two}} polarization components are shown in the figure {{at the top of}} the page, with the optic axis along the surface (and perpendicular to the plane of incidence), so that the angle of refraction is different for the p polarization (the [...] "ordinary ray" [...] in this case, having its polarization perpendicular to the optic axis) and the s polarization (the [...] "extraordinary ray" [...] with a polarization component along the optic axis). In addition, a distinct form of double refraction occurs in cases where the optic axis is not along the refracting surface (nor exactly normal to it); in this case the electric polarization of the <b>birefringent</b> <b>material</b> is not exactly in the direction of the wave's electric field for the extraordinary ray. The direction of power flow (given by the Poynting vector) for this inhomogenous wave is at a finite angle from the direction of the wave vector resulting in an additional separation between these beams. So even in the case of normal incidence, where the angle of refraction is zero (according to Snell's law, regardless of effective index of refraction), the energy of the extraordinary ray may be propagated at an angle. This is commonly observed using a piece of calcite cut appropriately with respect to its optic axis, placed above a paper with writing, as in the above two photographs.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there is}} no axis of symmetry, there are two optical axes or binormals which are defined as {{directions}} along which light may propagate without birefringence, i.e., directions along which the wavelength is independent of polarization. For this reason, <b>birefringent</b> <b>materials</b> with three distinct refractive indices are called biaxial. Additionally, there are two distinct axes known as optical ray axes or biradials along which the group velocity of the light is independent of polarization.|$|R

40|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of {{electron}} microscopy, polarised light was commonly used in structural research. New microscopical and mathematical methods have made the techniques worthy of reappraisal. I used quantative polarised light microscopy to examine tissue structure at both the fibre and molecular level. <b>Birefringent</b> <b>materials,</b> those with an anisotropic molecular organisation (such as collagen, muscle and elastin), can be studied using polarised light. The optical properties of <b>birefringent</b> <b>materials</b> {{were used to determine}} fibre orientation. Two-dimensional orientation was measured on the planar rotating microscope stage and three-dimensional orientation on a Universal stage. Molecular organisation, which affects optical anisotropy, was assessed by measuring the path-difference or retardation when linearly polarised light passes through <b>birefringent</b> <b>materials.</b> Five projects, focussing on collagen and muscle in cardiovascular tissues, were undertaken to demonstrate the usefulness of polarised light microscopy in structural studies.;I measured the two-dimensional orientation of cardiac muscle fibres in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and developed a quantitative method to complement the current qualitative method of diagnosis. I used the Universal stage to measure the orientation of collagen fibres in brain arteries and found that the fibres were predominantly circumferentially aligned at normal systolic pressures, but, at higher pressures a population of fibres had large longitudinal components of orientation. I measured the retardation in scar collagen produced following myocardial infarction and found that changes in the optical properties of collagen could be detected for at least six weeks after its production. A measured difference in retardation in tendons from floppy mitral valves, indicated that degraded collagen can also be detected using polarised light. Both fibre orientation and molecular organisation were assessed in cerebral saccular aneurysms. The aneurysm wall was layered and the collagen fibres were organised in a complex three-dimensional weave, suggesting a strong structure; however, the retardation in the aneurysm was lower than normal, indicating less molecular organisation and a possible reason why aneurysms enlarge and rupture.;The general conclusion is that quantitative polarised light mircoscopy remains an effective method in structural analysis...|$|R

Spatial dispersion properties of such a nanostructure can be dramatically affected by coupling of surface plasmons polaritons at different metal-dielectric interfaces. As a consequence, the effective medium approach is not applicable in general.
