For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{evolution}} of the Black Sea's salinity after {{the opening of the}} Bosporus about 7500 years ago is investigated using a simple two-box model. The model consists of watermass and salt conservation equations, and allows for changes in halocline depth. The paleoceanographic box model is forced by present-day Mediterranean inflow and outflow, and atmospheric forcings. Analytic solutions for the {{evolution of}} the <b>box</b> <b>volumes</b> are given. Model salinities reach 90 % of their the present-day values in both boxes about 2, 500 years after the opening of the Bosporus. The {{evolution of the}} salinities is shown to be almost independent of the evolution of the <b>box</b> <b>volumes,</b> and the results are compared with the existing paleoceanographic proxy records...|$|R

50|$|The {{result is}} that the coupled driver pair (iso-group) can now produce the same {{frequency}} response in half the <b>box</b> <b>volume</b> that a single driver of the same type would require. For example, if a speaker is optimized for performance in a 40 liter enclosure, one iso-group of the same speakers can achieve the same low frequency extension and overall response characteristics in a 20 liter enclosure. The aforementioned volumes exclude the isobaric chamber. If the iso group is placed in the original 40 liter, the loading will be incorrect (if the 40 liter was a correct loading of the loudspeaker).|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to approximate the minimum bounding <b>box</b> <b>volume,</b> to within any constant factor greater than one, in linear time. The algorithm for doing this involves finding an approximation to {{the diameter of the}} point set, and using a box oriented towards this diameter as an initial approximation to the minimum volume bounding box. Then, this initial bounding box is partitioned into a grid of smaller cubes, and grid points near the boundary of the convex hull of the input are used as a coreset, a small set of points whose optimum bounding box approximates the optimum bounding box of the original input. Finally, O'Rourke's algorithm is applied to find the exact optimum bounding box of this coreset.|$|E
