40|$|Abstract: Despite much public speculation, {{there is}} little {{scholarly}} research on whether or how ideology shapes American consumer behavior. Borrowing from previous studies, we theorize that ideology is associated with different forms of taste and conspicuous consumption: liberals are more drawn to indicators of “cultural capital” and more feminine symbols while conservatives favor more explicit signs of “economic capital ” and masculine cues. �ese ideas are tested using birth certi�cate, U. S. Census, and voting records from California in 2004. We �nd strong differences in <b>birth</b> <b>naming</b> practices related to race, economic status, and ideology. Although higher status mothers of all races favor more popular <b>birth</b> <b>names,</b> high status liberal mothers more o�en choose uncommon, culturally obscure <b>birth</b> <b>names.</b> Liberals also favor <b>birth</b> <b>names</b> with “so�er, feminine ” sounds while conservatives favor names with “harder, masculine ” phonemes. �ese �ndings have signi�cant implications for both studies of consumption and debates about ideology and political fragmentation in the United States...|$|R
