5|$|<b>Bostwick</b> {{started his}} career at Millwall, and played {{regularly}} for the club's under-18 team and reserve team. At the age of 17, he joined Conference National club Crawley Town on work experience during the latter stages of 2005–06 season. On return to Millwall, <b>Bostwick</b> signed a new one-year contract with the club, but {{was sent back to}} Crawley Town on loan in August 2006. <b>Bostwick</b> played regularly for Crawley until he was recalled by Millwall in January 2007, and was told he was surplus to requirements at the club.

5|$|<b>Bostwick</b> {{was offered}} a new deal by Ebbsfleet ahead of the 2008–09 season, but {{rejected}} the offer and instead opted to join Stevenage on a two-year deal, playing under the management of Graham Westley once more. He made his debut for Stevenage in the club's opening match of the season, a 5–0 defeat to Wrexham at the Racecourse Ground. <b>Bostwick</b> was used in both the centre of defence and the centre of midfield {{during the first half}} of the 2008–09 season, as well as playing at full back in the club's 1–0 defeat to Kettering Town in September 2008. <b>Bostwick</b> provided the assist for Lee Boylan's second-minute goal against Forest Green Rovers in a 3–0 victory.

5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, <b>Bostwick</b> scored in Stevenage's 2–1 {{pre-season}} victory at Dagenham & Redbridge on 30 July 2011. A week later, he started in Stevenage's first ever League One fixture, a 0–0 draw against Exeter City. Three days after the draw, on 9 August, <b>Bostwick</b> scored his first goal of the campaign in a 4–3 extra-time defeat to Championship team Peterborough United, scoring with a 25-yard shot that took the match to extra-time. In Stevenage's next league fixture, a 1–1 draw away at Chesterfield, he was sent-off after receiving two yellow cards, resulting in a one-match suspension. <b>Bostwick</b> signed a two-year contract extension with the club on 26 August 2011. He scored his second goal of the 2011–12 season in Stevenage's 5–1 home win over Sheffield Wednesday, with his 25-yard half-volley rebounding off of the post and into the net to give Stevenage a three-goal lead in the first-half. <b>Bostwick</b> was also instrumental in the club's 6–1 away victory at Colchester United on 26 December, scoring one goal and assisting another. His goal restored Stevenage's two-goal cushion in the match on the hour mark, before he assisted Scott Laird from a well-worked free-kick routine ten minutes later. He beat his goal tally from the previous season when he scored his fourth goal of the campaign in Stevenage's 4–2 victory against Milton Keynes Dons at Broadhall Way on 24 January 2012, with <b>Bostwick</b> restoring parity in the first-half with a long-range strike. <b>Bostwick</b> also scored in a 2–2 draw against Huddersfield Town on 28 February 2012, heading in Joel Byrom's cross to half the deficit as Stevenage fought back to earn a point after being two goals down. He scored two goals in as many matches in late March 2012, both of which were long-range strikes that drew Stevenage level in matches against Walsall and Bournemouth respectively. Four days after the goal against Bournemouth, <b>Bostwick</b> was on the scoresheet once again, his third goal within the space of a week, scoring late-on to give Stevenage a brief lead in an eventual draw against Wycombe Wanderers. He was almost ever-present during the campaign, playing 53 times and scoring eight goals, as Stevenage narrowly lost over two legs in the play-off semi-final. During his successful four seasons with the club, <b>Bostwick</b> made 207 appearances, scoring 22 goals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bostwick</b> {{began his}} career as a trainee with Millwall, and was a regular in the club's Under-18 team, as well as playing several times for the reserve team. During the latter stages of the 2005–06 season, <b>Bostwick</b> joined Conference National club Crawley Town on work experience. The move counted as work experience, as opposed to a loan, because of Bostwick's age – {{subsequently}} he could not appear for the first team of another Football League club, but was eligible to play for the first team of a non-league club. He made his debut for Crawley a week after joining the club, coming on as an 89th minute substitute in a 1–0 victory against Forest Green Rovers. He came on in the 83rd minute in the following match against Southport at Haig Avenue, as well as playing for 25 minutes against Burton Albion, setting up Tony Scully's 89th-minute equaliser. He subsequently started his first match in April 2006, playing the whole match in a 2–0 win against Aldershot Town, scoring Crawley's second. A week later, <b>Bostwick</b> scored both of Crawley's goals in the club's 2–2 draw against Halifax Town, netting in quick succession to give Crawley a two-goal lead. He played a total of eight matches for Crawley during his two-month work experience, scoring three times. On return to his parent club in May 2006, <b>Bostwick</b> signed a one-year contract with Millwall. Shortly before the start of the 2006–07 season, <b>Bostwick</b> was loaned out to Crawley Town for a second spell at the club. He played in the club's first five matches of the season, scoring twice from midfield in a 3–2 away win at Stevenage. In late August 2006, Crawley Town extended the loan deal until the end of the season, although Millwall were able to recall him in the January transfer window if they deemed it necessary. <b>Bostwick</b> played a total of 25 times during the first half of the season, scoring twice, before Millwall recalled him in January 2007.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Boerstler {{made for}} Frenchman’s Creek but {{four of his}} eleven boats, “misled by the {{darkness}} of the night or the inexperienced rowers being unable to force them across the current, fell below, near the bridge and were forced to return”. Nevertheless, Boerstler’s seven remaining boats forced a landing, opposed by Lieutenant Bartley and his 37 men of the 49th Regiment. Boerstler led the attack, shooting with his pistol a British soldier who was about to bayonet him. Bartley's outnumbered force retired, pursued to the Frenchman's Creek Bridge by the Americans, who took two prisoners. Boerstler's men were then attacked by Captain <b>Bostwick’s</b> two companies of Norfolk Militia, who had advanced from Black Rock Ferry. After an exchange of fire in which <b>Bostwick’s</b> force lost 3 killed, 15 wounded and 6 captured, the Canadians retreated. Boerstler now encountered another problem: many of the axes provided for the destruction of the Frenchman’s Creek bridge were in the four boats that had turned back and those that were in the seven remaining boats had been left behind when the Americans fought their way ashore. Boerstler dispatched eight men under Lieutenant John Waring to “break up the bridge by any means which they could find”. Waring had torn up {{about a third of the}} planking on the bridge when it was learned from a prisoner that “the whole force from Fort Erie was coming down upon them”. Boerstler quickly re-embarked his command and rowed back to Buffalo, leaving behind Waring and his party at the bridge.|$|R

5000|$|Privateer William Kidd buried {{treasure}} on {{the island}} in June 1699, having stopped there while sailing to Boston to answer charges of piracy. With {{the permission of the}} island's proprietor, he buried a chest and a box of gold and two boxes of silver (the box of gold, Kidd told Gardiner, was intended for Lord Bellomont) in a ravine between <b>Bostwick's</b> Point and the Manor House. He gave Mrs. Gardiner a length of gold cloth for her trouble, captured from a Moorish ship off Madagascar (a piece of which is now at the East Hampton library), and a sack of sugar. It is said that Kidd warned that, if the treasure was not there when he returned, he would kill the Gardiners, although trial testimony given by John Gardiner on July 17, 1699 makes no mention of any threats, and Kidd's conduct appears to have been quite civil. [...] Kidd was tried in Boston, and Gardiner was ordered by Governor Bellomont to deliver the treasure as evidence.

50|$|The club {{entered the}} 2011-12 FA Cup at the First Round stage — {{only the second}} time the club had entered the {{competition}} at this stage since 1997. The First Round draw was made on 29 October, with Stevenage facing an away trip to League One side Hartlepool United. The game was played on 12 November, with Stevenage securing a 1-0 away win. Hartlepool were reduced to ten men after just eight minutes when goalkeeper Scott Flinders brought Chris Beardsley down in the area. Scott Laird scored the subsequent penalty and Stevenage held on to book a place in the Second Round. The following day, Stevenage were dealt an away tie against either League Two strugglers Plymouth Argyle or Southern Football League side Stourbridge. Stourbridge beat Plymouth 2-0 in the replay, meaning they would host Stevenage at the War Memorial Athletic Ground on 3 December. Stevenage progressed to the Third Round for the second consecutive season after they beat Stourbridge 3-0 courtesy of three second-half goals. After a cagey first-half, Stevenage opened the scoring mid-way into the second period, with Chris Beardsley scoring from six yards out after Michael <b>Bostwick's</b> shot had been parried out by goalkeeper Lewis Solly.

5|$|In 1981, Sharman {{reunited with}} O'Brien to do Shock Treatment, a {{stand-alone}} feature {{that was not}} a direct sequel to the original film. This film reunites characters Brad and Janet and was originally conceived and written to depict the characters filmed in normal settings until the production changed to work around a Screen Actor's Guild strike. The eventual production would now entail the full film being shot entirely within a sound stage and purposely blending that into the story line. Shock Treatment has a cult following but not nearly as strong as the first film, and was a commercial failure in no small part due to the principal cast of Curry, Sarandon and <b>Bostwick</b> not returning.|$|E

The club's first away game in the Football League ended in a 1-0 defeat against Bradford City at Valley Parade. Bradford striker Gareth Evans scored the only goal of the game from the penalty spot in the first-half {{in a game that}} was [...] "rough luck on the visitors" [...] having dominated large parts of the game.

Two weeks later, he scored his first competitive goal of the 2011–12 campaign in Stevenage's 1–1 away draw against Oldham Athletic on 10 September. Roberts' goal came in the fourth minute of the match, heading in Michael <b>Bostwick's</b> shot to give Stevenage the lead. His second goal of the campaign came in the club's exit from the Football League Trophy on 4 October, with Roberts scoring a 20-yard volley in injury-time to take the game to penalties, which Stevenage subsequently lost 4–3. He described the volley as [...] "easily the best goal of his career". Roberts scored once again, on 29 October, in a 2–1 away victory against Bury. The goal was a [...] "glancing header" [...] from Joel Byrom's cross to double Stevenage's advantage in the match with fifteen minutes remaining. A week later, he scored his fourth goal of the season in the club's 2–1 home win over Sheffield United, turning in the six yard box before lashing a shot into the roof of the net to give Stevenage a first-half lead. Roberts' fifth goal of the campaign came in Stevenage's last home game of 2011, scoring with a header from Robin Shroot's cross to give ten-man Stevenage a two-goal lead in an eventual 2–1 home victory against Tranmere Rovers. Following Graham Westley's departure to Preston North End on 13 January 2012, Roberts was made player-manager for Stevenage's away trip to Rochdale, with the club securing a 5–1 victory at Spotland on 14 January. He remained in-charge of the team for two further matches, a 1–1 draw at Scunthorpe United, and a 4–2 home victory against Milton Keynes Dons, until the appointment of manager Gary Smith allowed Roberts to concentrate on the playing side of the game. Under Roberts' guidance, Stevenage secured seven points out of a possible nine. He scored in successive games towards the latter stages of the season; a late equaliser against Preston North End, as well as netting the fifth goal in the club's 6–0 away win against Yeovil Town on 14 April 2012. Roberts played every minute of all 56 of Stevenage's games during the campaign, scoring seven goals from defence, with the club narrowly losing out in the play-off semi-finals. Stevenage also made it to the Fifth Round of the FA Cup, the furthest the club had reached in the competition; with Roberts playing in all six cup matches, including two matches against Tottenham Hotspur as the club took the Premier League side to a replay. He was also named as Stevenage's Player of the Year at the end of the season, becoming only the third player to win the award twice.|$|R
