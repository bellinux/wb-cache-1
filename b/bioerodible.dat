50|$|The {{ease with}} which {{properties}} can be controlled and fine-tuned by the linkage of different side groups to polyphosphazene chains has prompted major efforts to address biomedical materials challenges using these polymers. Different polymers have been studied as macromolecular drug carriers, as membranes for the controlled delivery of drugs, as biostable elastomers, and especially as tailored <b>bioerodible</b> materials for the regeneration of living bone. An advantage for this last application is that poly(dichlorophosphazene) reacts with amino acid ethyl esters (such as ethyl glycinate or the corresponding ethyl esters of numerous other amino acids) through the amino terminus to form polyphosphazenes with amino acid ester side groups. These polymers hydrolyze slowly to a near-neutral, pH-buffered solution of the amino acid, ethanol, phosphate, and ammonium ion. The speed of hydrolysis depends on the amino acid ester, with half-lives that vary from weeks to months depending {{on the structure of}} the amino acid ester. Nanofibers and porous constructs of these polymers assist osteoblast replication and accelerate the repair of bone in animal model studies.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the <b>bioerodible</b> polymer poly(maleic anhydride-alt- 2 -methoxyethyl vinyl ether) n-butyl hemiester, for multicomponent drug-loaded nanofibers produced by electrospinning. Diclofenac sodium (DS) and human serum albumin (HSA) were used as conventional drug and biopharmaceutical models. The influence of drug loading was correlated to beads presence, morphology and fibers diameter. When DS and HSA were loaded separately, a uniform distribution within fibers and beads was observed. However, when both components were loaded simultaneously, a heterogeneous distribution of DS was observed with a prominent amount in the cylindrical beads. The in vitro drug release evaluation from these nanomaterials displayed an independent delivery of the two components. These studies support the feasibility of multicomponent, <b>bioerodible</b> polymeric nanofibers preparation loaded with combination of traditional drugs and proteins...|$|E
40|$|Local {{delivery}} of antimicrobial agents in inflamed periodontal pocket {{has been shown}} to be effective in reducing periodontopathic microorganisms. This research focuses on developing and characterizing <b>bioerodible</b> formulations based on auto-catalyzed poly(ortho esters) (POExLAy) for modulated release of tetracycline over 2 weeks. POExLAy are a new versatile family of POE-containing lactoyl lactyl dimers in the polymer backbone. By modifying the proportion of lactic acid in the polymer, viscous or solid materials having different degradation rate can be produced. The formulations can be either injected or placed as a solid device directly into the periodontal pocket. Tetracycline-free base incorporated into these materials was released within 10 - 14 days depending on polymer structure. Increase in lactic acid content in the polymer tended to increase the drug release rate and to reduce the initial lag time. Tetracycline release from such <b>bioerodible</b> delivery system occurs predominantly by surface erosion of the polymeric matrix, leading to kinetics which can be zero order. This periodontal drug delivery system is designed to be used as an adjunct in the treatment of periodontal diseases. Clinical studies are currently in progress...|$|E

40|$|Background and aims. A carious lesion is the {{accumulation}} of numerous episodes of de- and remineralization, rather than a unidirectional demineralization process. Tooth destruction can be arrested or reversed by the frequent delivery of fluoride or calcium/phosphorous ions to the tooth surface. The present study compared and evaluated the remineralization potential of sodium fluoride and bioactive glass delivered through a <b>bioerodible</b> gel system. Materials and methods. Longitudinal sections of artificial carious lesions, created at the gingivofacial surface of 64 primary maxillary incisors were photographed under a polarized light microscope and quantified for demineralization. The sections were repositioned into the tooth form and randomly mounted in sets of four that simulated an arch form. The teeth were divided into 4 groups: 1) sodium fluoride films, 2) bioactive glass films, 3) control films placed interproximally and 4) nontreatment group. Following exposure to artificial saliva for 30 days, the lesions were again photographed and quantified as above. The recorded values were statistically analyzed using Student’s paired t-test for intragroup comparison, one-way ANOVA and Post-Hoc Tukey’s test for pairwise comparison. Results. The sodium fluoride and bioactive gel groups showed significant remineralization compared with the control groups (P < 0. 001). Conclusion. <b>Bioerodible</b> gel films {{can be used to}} deliver remineralizing agents to enhance remineralization...|$|E
40|$|The {{erosion of}} <b>bioerodible</b> {{polymers}} depends on many factors including the polymer chain length, bond cleavage velocity, swellability, crystallinity, and water diffusivity in the polymer matrix. This multitude of parameters makes modeling of erosion difficult. Only a few models exist that describe morphological changes of polymers during erosion qualitatively. In the present approach the polymer matrix was represented as {{the sum of}} small individual polymer matrix parts. The factors that determine erosion were combined, and the erosion of each matrix piece {{was regarded as a}} random event. Once such a matrix piece had come into contact with water, an individual life expectation was assigned to it using Monte Carlo techniques. The proposed model can describe complicated phenomena such as changes in polymer matrix microstructure, movement of erosion fronts, creation of pores, and weight loss during erosion, yet it is simple and easy to use. For quantitative evaluations the model was fit to experimental data for weight loss and erosion front movement. The so obtained model constants proved to be useful for the prediction of independent parameters like the porosity of polymer matrices during erosion. This modeling approach may help broaden the understanding of the role of polymer erosion when considering <b>bioerodible</b> polymers in applications such as controlled drug delivery or tissue engineering...|$|E

Objective of the current study was to evaluate the suitability of <b>bioerodible</b> polymeric material based on n-butyl hemiester of [poly(maleic anhydride-alt- 2 -methoxyethyl vinyl ether) ] (PAM 14) for the preparation of nanomats for controlled administration of anti-inflammatory, diclofenac sodium (DS) drug.

Thermal analysis such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed to detect effect on polymer arrangement. DS localization in electrospun nanomats was evaluated by using electron back scattering microanalysis, based on the detection of chlorine, and drug release kinetics was assessed using UV-Vis. Average fiber diameter resulted in the range of 100 nm to 1. 0 mu m and a homogeneous distribution of the loaded drug into the fibers was observed.

The objective {{of the current study}} is to evaluate the use of a new <b>bioerodible</b> polymer for release of diclofenac sodium (DS). 1 -butanol hemiester poly(maleic anhydride-alt- 2 -methoxyethyl vinyl ether) (PAM 14) was prepared in the university of Pisa and selected as polymer of choice for the study. Polymer solutions of 5 - 10 % (in ethanol or in acetic acid) were prepared, half of them containing 2 % DS. The solutions were then electrospun to produce nanomats that were subsequently characterized using SEM. Fiber diameter was 160 nm 1 μm. Increasing polymer concentration increased the size of the fibers but reduced the number of beads (with or without DS). In the specimens obtained from acetic acid solution, the addition of DS resulted in a reduction in fiber diameter and an increase in the inter-bead distance. Corresponding ethanol solutions gave more homogeneous specimens than did acetic acid, having a lower number of beads. With the addition of DS a reduction in fiber diameter was observed for the acetic acid specimens. However, in ethanol, adding DS resulted in increased fiber diameter. Accordingly, it can be concluded that it is feasible to develop electrospun diclofenac releasing <b>bioerodible</b> nanostructures that have potential use in pain management.

40|$|The {{research}} work carried out for developing <b>bioerodible</b> drug delivery devices {{in which the}} erosion process was to be confined to the polymer-water interface is at {{the origin of the}} discovery of a class of polymers known as poly(ortho esters) (POEs). Thus far, three POE systems have been described. The latest POE was prepared by a transesterification reaction between a triol and an ortho ester, followed by a self-condensation of the reaction product. This polymer, which exhibits viscous characteristics at room temperature, was investigated for use as a drug delivery system in glaucoma filtering surgery. The assessment of POE purity and stability was carried out by a detailed analysis of the influence of the purification procedure and storage conditions. This <b>bioerodible</b> semi-solid POE was purified by a repeated precipitation procedure. Elimination of the small molecular weight oligomers and monomers and of the catalysts and stabilizers used in the synthesis, as well as a decrease of the polydispersity, were obtained with this method. Fourier transform infrared analysis also verified the disappearance of degradation products after the first precipitation. Drying of the precipitated polymer was performed at 40 degrees C in order to avoid thermal degradation of the POE at higher temperatures and to facilitate solvent evaporation through the polymer network by a reduction of polymer viscosity. Water vapour uptake of the polymers stored at different relative humidities has demonstrated the high moisture sensitivity of these semi-solid POEs. The average molecular weight of the polymer and hence its viscosity, as well as the solubility characteristics of the incorporated drug, were found to have a considerable influence on the rate of water vapour absorption and on polymer degradation. The use of inert gas or vacuum to maintain the polymer under anhydrous conditions has been studied. Storage of the semi-solid POE under argon in sealed glass bottles provides good protection of the polymer over time...|$|E
30|$|Polymers {{containing}} labile groups {{present an}} beneficial {{opportunity to develop}} redox-responsive biodegradable or <b>bioerodible</b> systems. Acid labile moieties inside polyanhydrides [61, 62], poly(lactic/glycolic acid) (PLGA) [63], and poly(β-amino esters) (PbAEs) [64] induce redox responsiveness. Disulfide groups have also been used to induce redox responsiveness, because they are unstable in a reducing environment, being cleaved in favour of corresponding thiol groups [65, 66]. Polymers with disulfide cross-links degrade when exposed to cysteine or glutathione, which are reductive amino-acid based molecules [67]. Another typical redox responsive polymer is poly(NiPAAm-co-Ru(bpy) 3), which can generate a chemical wave by the periodic redox change of Ru(bpy) 3 into an oxidized state of lighter colour [68]. This redox reaction alters the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic properties of the polymer chains and results in swelling and deswelling of the polymer.|$|E

We propose here a new class of fine-grained multi-agent models built to incorpo-rate increasing complexity, permitting the exploration of the role of different parameters, especially that of the internal morphology of the spheres, in the exhibited release profile. This approach, based on Monte-Carlo (MC) and Cellular Automata (CA) techniques, has permitted the testing of various as-sumptions and hypotheses about several experimental systems of nanospheres encapsulating proteins.

40|$|The poly(ortho ester), POE, {{used in this}} investigation, is a viscous <b>bioerodible</b> polymer (8 kDa), which rapidly degrades into a triol and an acidic by-product, acetic acid. In {{order to}} improve biocompatibility, we have {{evaluated}} the addition of various basic excipients, such as sodium acetate, hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide, which buffered and neutralized the acidic degradation product and prolonged the polymer lifetime and drug release. This decrease of POE degradation rate results in a decreased rate of formation of the acidic by-product. Similarly, a POE of higher molecular weight (14 kDa) has been tested. Sodium acetate was too hydrophilic to affect the drug release and the biocompatibility of the polymer, whereas the presence of magnesium hydroxide markedly prolonged the drug release and improved the acceptability of the polymer. The increased molecular weight POE did not improve biocompatibility and a similar but delayed, inflammatory reaction was observed...|$|E

By replacing the 1, 2, 6 -hexanetriol with 1, 2, 10 -decanetriol, a higher molecular weight aliphatic triol, the physio-chemical characteristics of the polymer can be changed. The new POE, prepared by a transesterification reaction of trimethyl orthoacetate and 1, 2, 10 -decanetriol is less viscous and more hydrophobic.

The combination of wound healing modulators such as 5 -fluorouracil and dexamethasone is a major advantage since these drugs act {{at different stages of}} these diseases. Since 5 -fluorouracil is an acidic, water-soluble compound and dexamethasone exists in three chemical forms, i. e. the water-insoluble base, the highly hydrophobic acetate ester or the basic phosphate salt, it was of interest to investigate whether the physicochemical properties of the drugs have an influence on their release rates, and whether a concomitant and sustained release of both 5 -fluorouracil and dexamethasone could be achieved. It has been found that lipophilicity and acidobasicity {{play a major role in}} controlling drug release rates and polymer degradation. The combination of 5 -fluorouracil and dexamethasone phosphate allows a sustained and concomitant release of both drugs, due to the basic characteristics of the corticosteroid which stabilize the polymer.

40|$|Polyanhydride {{copolymers}} {{based on}} 1, 6 -bis(p-carboxyphenoxy) hexane (CPH) and sebacic acid (SA) are <b>bioerodible,</b> semicrystalline polymers {{that have been}} used for drug delivery. In addition to their semicrystallinity, these materials also exhibit microphase separation in the amorphous phase. This complex phase behavior, combined with the disparity in the erosion rates of the two different chemical moieties, leads to a complex erosion kinetics {{that can be used to}} tailor drug release kinetics. Thus, accurate design of drug delivery devices requires a detailed description of the microphase separation. Here, we employ in situ synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to explore the microstructure of these materials. First, we examine the crystallization kinetics of the homopolymers and CPH-SA copolymers. Next, we perform experiments on poly(CPH) /poly(SA) homopolymer blends in the miscible melt in order to discern the segmentsegment interaction parameter, χCPH-SA. This parameter predicts the enthalpy of mixing poly(CPH) and poly(SA) at the monomer level and can be used to predict the phase behavior of the blend. It also offers insights into the thermodynamics that drive the microphase separation in the copolymers.

POE was evaluated as a blank carrier and as containing modulators of degradation. Each formulation was injected intracamerally and intravitreally in rabbit eyes, and clinical and histological examinations were performed postoperatively for 2 weeks. In {{the case of}} intracameral injections, polymer biocompatibility appeared {{to depend on the}} amount injected in the anterior chamber. When 50 microL was administered, the polymer degraded within 2 weeks, and clinical observations showed good biocompatibility of POE with no toxicity to the ocular tissues or increase in intraocular pressure. The injection of a larger volume, 100 microL, of POE, appeared inappropriate because of direct contact of polymeric material with the corneal endothelium, and triggered reversible edema and inflammation in the anterior chamber of the eye that regressed after a few days. After intravitreal administration, POE was well tolerated and no inflammatory reaction developed during the observation period. The polymer degraded slowly, appearing as a round whitish bubble in the vitreous cavity. The presence of modulators of degradation both improved POE biocompatibility and prolonged polymer lifetime in the eye.

Follow-up consisted of fundus observations, echography, fluorescein angiography, and histologic analysis over 3 weeks. RESULTS: After injection, POE spread in the suprachoroidal space at the posterior pole. It was well tolerated and progressively disappeared from the site of injection without sequelae. No bleeding or retinal detachment occurred. Echographic pictures showed that the material was present in the suprachoroidal space for 3 weeks. Angiography revealed minor pigment irregularities at the site of injection, but no retinal edema or necrosis. Histology showed that POE was well tolerated in the choroid.

Alternatively, polymeric carriers can be made <b>bioerodible</b> in order to be eliminated by natural ways after a certain time of therapy. Core-shell fibres from coaxial spinneret or emulsion electrospinning are good candidates for the development of such devices; however difficulties remain especially in controlling the release over a sustained period.

The design of drug microreservoirs of variable size within the bulk of the fibre combined with a tailored diffusive barrier allows modulating the release kinetics of these novel carriers.

POE(70) LA(30) was synthesized, sterilized by gamma irradiation, and injected in rabbit eyes at adequate volumes through subconjunctival, intracameral, intravitreal, and suprachoroidal routes. Clinical examinations {{were performed}} postoperatively at regular time points for 6 mo, and histopathologic analysis {{was carried out}} to confirm tissular biocompatibility. After subconjunctival injection, the polymer was well tolerated and persisted in the subconjunctival space for about 5 weeks. In the case of intracameral injections, polymer biocompatibility was good; the POE(70) LA(30) bubble was still present in the anterior chamber for up to 6 mo after injection. No major histopathologic anomalies were detected, {{with the exception of}} a localized Descemet membrane thickening. After intravitreal administration, POE(70) LA(30) biocompatibility was excellent, and no inflammatory reaction could be detected during the observation period. The polymer was degraded in approximately 3 mo. Suprachoroidal injections of POE(70) LA(30) were reproducible and well tolerated. POE(70) LA(30) triggered a slight elevation of the retina and choroid upon clinical observation. The polymer was detectable in the suprachoroidal space for about 6 mo. No inflammatory reaction and no major retinal anomalies could be detected by histology. In conclusion, POE(70) LA(30) appears to be a promising biomaterial for intraocular application, potentially providing sustained drug delivery over an extended period of time, with a good tolerance...|$|E

Evidence indicates that the rate of constipation is lower when patients are switched from sublingual buprenorphine–naloxone tablets or films to a bilayered <b>bioerodible</b> mucoadhesive buccal film formulation, and while the bilayered buccal film promotes unidirectional drug flow across the buccal mucosa, the mechanism for the reduced constipation is unclear. Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that chronic dosing of sublingually administered buprenorphine may expose patients to higher concentrations of norbuprenorphine than buprenorphine, while chronic dosing of the buccal formulation results in higher buprenorphine concentrations than norbuprenorphine. Because norbuprenorphine is a potent full agonist at mu-opioid receptors, the differences in norbuprenorphine exposure may explain the observed differences in treatment-emergent constipation between the sublingual formulation and the buccal film formulation of buprenorphine–naloxone. To facilitate the understanding and management of opioid-dependent patients at risk of developing opioid-induced constipation, the clinical profiles of these formulations of buprenorphine and buprenorphine-naloxone are summarized, and the incidence of treatment-emergent constipation in clinical trials is reviewed. These data are used to propose a potential role for exposure to norbuprenorphine, an active metabolite of buprenorphine, in the pathophysiology of opioid-induced constipation.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} long-term effects of stent-based paclitaxel delivery on amount, rate and composition of neointimal thickening after stent implantation. BACKGROUNDPaclitaxel prevents vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration in vitro and in vivo. These actions, coupled with low solubility, make it a viable candidate for modulating vascular responses to injury and prolonged effects after local delivery. We asked whether local delivery of paclitaxel for a period of weeks from a stent coated with a <b>bioerodible</b> polymer could produce a sustained reduction in neointimal hyperplasia for up to six months after stenting. METHODSStainless steel stents were implanted in the iliac arteries of rabbits after endothelial denudation. Stents were uncoated or coated with a thin layer of poly(lactide-co-Σ-caprolactone) copolymer alone or containing paclitaxel, 200 μg. RESULTSPaclitaxel release in vitro followed first-order kinetics for two months. Tissue responses were examined 7, 28, 56 or 180 days after implantation. Paclitaxel reduced intimal and medial cell proliferation three-fold seven days after stenting and virtually eliminated later intimal thickening. Six months after stenting, long after drug release and polymer degradation were likely complete, neointimal area was two-fold lower in paclitaxel-releasing stents. Tissue responses in paclitaxel-treated vessels included incomplete healing, few smooth muscle cells, late persistence of macrophages and dense fibrin with little collagen. CONCLUSIONSPoly(lactide-co-Σ-caprolactone) copolymer-coated stents permit sustained paclitaxel delivery in a manner that virtually abolishes neointimal hyperplasia for months after stent implantation, long after likely completion of drug delivery and polymer degradation...|$|E
