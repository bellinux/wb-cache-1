We construct our own time-varying dataset for national fiscal frameworks for the period 1990 - 2012 covering all 27 EU Member States and estimate a dynamic panel on aggregate and disaggregated fiscal policy variables. We find strong support that numerical fiscal rules help to improve the primary balance, and that the <b>budgetary</b> <b>impact</b> can be further strengthened when supported by independent fiscal councils and an effective medium-term budgeting framework...|$|R

40|$|We {{implement}} a meta-regression-analysis for the <b>budgetary</b> <b>impact</b> of numerical fiscal rules. Based on 30 studies {{published in the}} last decade, we offer a consensus estimate {{with respect to the}} level of statistical significance, provide suggestive evidence for the effect size, and identify study features of relevance for the measured impact of fiscal rules. Overall, the results document a constraining impact of rules. However, this impact is weakened if refined identification strategies are employed. Moreover, the results provide evidence for a publication bias in which journals are more likely to report constraining and statistically significant effects compared to working papers. We further provide recommendations for future research on the <b>budgetary</b> <b>impact</b> of fiscal rules...|$|R

40|$|Background: Reimbursement of {{new drugs}} is usually {{based on the}} <b>budgetary</b> <b>impact</b> of a new drug {{but there is also}} {{increasing}} demand for cost-effectiveness data on new drugs. Objective: To present a modelling technique (methodology) for an appropriate assessment of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>impact</b> of a new drug, which can simultaneously be used for a traditional cost-effectiveness analysis. Design and perspective: To illustrate the methodology, a model was constructed for a new hypothetical drug in Parkinson's disease, which allowed us to determine the <b>budgetary</b> <b>impact</b> and the cost effectiveness of this new antiparkinsonian drug from a societal perspective. The methodology consisted of two steps: (i) a simple population model (Markov model) was constructed to validate the epidemiological data by proving the consistency between the prevalence and incidence of Parkinson's disease for the Dutch population; (ii) this model was extended to a more complex model (semi-Markov model) by incorporation of disease progression for Parkinson's disease and all relevant economic and clinical measures. These included all drug utilisation associated with Parkinson's disease, as well as other resource utilisation patterns associated with outpatient and inpatient care for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Results: The study showed that the difference in epidemiological data between a simple model and a complex model are substantial, which justifies the development of a complex model with a higher external validity. The complex model allowed an assessment of all potential candidates for the new drug and simultaneously allowed the assessment of the cost effectiveness of the new drug versus usual care. Conclusion: One model can be used for an appropriate assessment of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>impact</b> and the cost effectiveness of a new drug.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} the current approach to victim <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> in New Zealand serves victims poorly. The primary purpose of victim <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> is {{to provide information about}} harm, in order to assist the sentencing judge to assess the seriousness of the offending. This limits the extent to which victim <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> can meet victims’ needs and protect their interests. This dissertation proposes a new role for victim <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> (with a focus on their use in sexual violence cases). It {{argues that the}} purpose of victim <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> should be to meet victims’ needs for recognition, acknowledgement and assistance with recovery, and to protect victims’ interests in reparation and prevention of further harm from the offender and from the sentence imposed on the offender. Meeting these needs and protecting these interests is necessary to provide justice for victims. Finally, this dissertation argues that victim <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> should not be used to assess the seriousness of the offending...|$|R

These judicial responses to emotional expression, however, must be contextualized; for example, the judges we spoke with often articulated different reactions to <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> given by victims of sexual assault, those who are strangers to the perpetrator, and <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> given by victims of domestic violence, those who are in a relationship with the perpetrator...|$|R
