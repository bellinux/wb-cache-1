On the {{foundation}} of taking equipment and production technology into consideration,we present a set of combined setting technology of the parameter of the strip suit to cold reduction mill of roll four and framework five. Then the parameter of the strip was controlled combined and coordinated of framework 1 - 5. On the one hand,it ensures {{the function of the}} force of the <b>bending</b> <b>roll</b> not cancel out mutually,and enhances the controlled effect of the force of the <b>bending</b> <b>roll</b> in the strip,on the other hand, there will not be new extra and partial shape wave under the complex effect of the force of the <b>bending</b> <b>roll.</b> Meanwhile there will not be the problem that the force of the <b>bending</b> <b>roll</b> in some parts get too high even overall loading while the other parts get get too low in the setting procedure. While improving the lifespan of the fluid cylinder, the adjusting rest of the force of the <b>bending</b> <b>roll</b> get increased.

40|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>bending</b> is an {{efficient}} metal forming technique, where plates are bent {{to a desired}} curvature using forming rolls. This type of sheet forming process {{is one of the}} most widely used techniques for manufacturing axisymmetric hollow shapes. Moreover, this process is beginning to be taken into serious consideration by industries for producing large, thick parts such as the conically shaped crown of a Francis turbine runner or of a wind turbine tower. Because of the numerous processing parameters, reducing the bending force and improving the accuracy of the final shape are significant challenges in the <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> process. Therefore, the primary aim of this research is to find the strategies for reducing forming forces and improving final part quality by employing numerical and experimental methods. In this thesis, a 3 D dynamic Finite Element (FE) model of an asymmetrical <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> process is developed using the Ansys/LS-Dyna software. The simulation results are then compared with experiments performed with instrumented parts and <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> <b>machine.</b> The parameters that affect the accuracy of the final shape, the bending forces and the residual strain left in the formed plate have been investigated. Applying this 3 D dynamic FE model in an industrial context may predict the forming forces or the accuracy of the final shape’s radius and thus will decrease the setup time before manufacturing. The forming forces can be reduced by heating the plate. In this research, the relationships between the heating plate temperature and the output parameters of <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> process such as applied forces and final shape quality have been studied by performing FE simulation and analytical computations. These results yield to a better understanding of the mechanism of the process and provide an opportunity for the design of {{an efficient}} heating system to control the heat energy to be input in the plate during the <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> process. This research also proposes a new, simple approach for reducing flat areas and forming forces. This approach includes moving the bottom roll slightly along the feeding direction and adjusting the bottom roll location. The FE results indicate that this new approach effectively minimizes the flat area extents and reduces also the forming forces...|$|R
40|$|In forming {{of glasses}} frame, bending and inverse bending of rim wires with 4 rolls are usually employed. Only an inverse <b>bending</b> <b>roll,</b> the 4 th roll, {{can change the}} {{position}} to control the curvature of the rim wire. A deriving method of inverse <b>bending</b> <b>roll</b> position is proposed in this study. The proposed method requires not the computational simulations but only some simple steady inverse bending experiments to obtain a relationship between inverse <b>bending</b> <b>roll</b> position and bent curvature which depends on machine condition and bent wire. The experimentally obtained relationship {{is used in the}} formulation of deriving the inverse <b>bending</b> <b>roll</b> position. To validate the proposed method, a real glasses frame shape is formed by the proposed and conventional methods. The difference between the designed and formed shapes is evaluated by a sum of absolute shape deviation.

40|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>bending</b> and <b>roll</b> {{twisting}} are {{processes for}} forming beams of constant cross section into desired shapes by bending and/or twisting the workpiece {{while it is}} <b>rolled</b> through the <b>machine.</b> The objective of the shaping process for beams is to impart a desired angle of twist and a desired curvature at each point along the beam. A closed-loop shape control system was developed by analyzing the mechanics of bending and twisting unsymmetrical beams, such as angles and channels. The shaping process is separated into an unsymmetrical <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> operation and a roll twisting operation. The unsymmetrical <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> operation bends the workpiece about a specified neutral axis to some desired unloaded curvature while the workpiece is in the loaded state. The control of the unsymmetrical <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> operation is decoupled into two simultaneous, but separate, symmetrical <b>roll</b> <b>bending</b> controllers about each principal axis of inertia. Assuming the workpiece will spring back elastically, each principal axis controller computes the unloaded curvature from real-time measurements of the loade...|$|R

40|$|Using {{finite element}} method (FEM), the results of bending {{conditions}} of the intermediate plate at the <b>bending</b> <b>rolls</b> of a coilbox between the roughing and finishing stands in a hot strip mill were obtained. The intermediate plate was coiled in a coilbox, which effectively overcame the problem of temperature drop by reducing surface area exposed to radiant heat loss during the waiting period. Different states of the plate in the coilbox were simulated by FEM, and the mathematical model of the <b>bending</b> <b>rolls</b> was established, which was {{in accord with the}} simulation results that the plate was coiled. As the bending shape of {{the front end of the}} intermediate plate is crucial to coiling process, the curvatures of the plate were predicted through FEM.

40|$|AbstractWe {{measure the}} three {{dimensional}} movement of cracked solar cell parts in standard sized PV-modules during a four line bending test. We develop a model which explains this movement {{assuming that the}} centers of mass of the solar cells or cell parts are fixed to the module glass. The widening of all cell gap widths {{is proportional to the}} <b>bending</b> <b>roll</b> displacement until a cell cracks in parallel to the <b>bending</b> <b>rolls</b> due to the tensile stress in the cells. At this point, the crack opens abruptly while the two parallel cell gaps next to the cracked cell close simultaneously by the same distance in sum. From here on, the cell gaps and the cell crack increases proportionally to the <b>bending</b> <b>roll</b> displacement. Since the distance between the centers of mass of both cracked cell parts is independent of the crack position, the crack width is also independent of the crack position for single cracks. Multiple parallel cracks in solar cells have smaller crack widths according to this model. Laminates without a backsheet show about 30 % larger crack widths...|$|R
