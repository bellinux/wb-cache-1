50|$|After {{the fall}} of Tsarist Russia, the recipe was popularly served in the hotels and {{restaurants}} of China {{before the start of}} World War II. Russian and Chinese immigrants, as well as US servicemen stationed in pre-Communist China, brought several variants of the dish to the United States, which may account for its popularity during the 1950s. It came to Hong Kong in the late fifties, with Russian restaurants and hotels serving the dish with rice, but not sour cream. In the version often prepared in the United States today in restaurants and hotels, it consists of strips of <b>beef</b> <b>filet</b> with a mushroom, onion, and sour cream sauce, and is served over rice or noodles.|$|E
40|$|Summary Prospects in {{introducing}} GM {{plants in the}} Italian agricultural production system (JEL: Q 18) The {{purpose of the present}} study is to evaluate the willingness of the Italian farmers and consumers respectively, to cultivate GM plants and to buy GM foods. In Italy is not allowed, at the moment, the cultivation of GM plants. Notwithstanding GM foods are normally present on the Italian market, which is strongly dependant from foreign markets especially for soy bean based foodstuffs primarily containing GMO. The study indicates that only 18 % of the Italian farmers are interested in cultivating GMO, mainly in the cereal and livestock sector where GM products are strongly utilized as feeding stuffs for animals. The consumers that declare to be favorable to GMO are 3 % while 8 % consider Italian agriculture to be somehow affected by GM presence. To the majority of the Italian consumers, particularly when buying <b>beef</b> <b>filet</b> and chicken food, it is more important the information regarding the fact that animals have been raised and fed with GMO – free feeding stuffs rather than the price of the products itself. Within this framework, the opportunity and consequent choice of not cultivating GM plants seems, therefore, sustainable when considered on an overall supply chain approach aiming to offer a highly qualified product or, as in the case of animal feed stuffs, obtained without utilizing GMO...|$|E
5000|$|A {{traditional}} use for lardons is in {{a technique}} called [...] "larding", in which long strips of chilled pork fat are threaded (with {{the use of a}} needle) into meats that are to be braised or roasted, such as <b>beef</b> <b>filets</b> or veal (especially lean cuts), poultry, and lean fish such as salmon. These lardons are to be cut in strips about 3 mm thick and 3 mm wide, and it is essential that the fat be chilled before cutting and threading. The technique is explained at length in the classic book of French cuisine La bonne cuisine de Madame E. Saint-Ange, which details two techniques: surface larding, or [...] "studding", in which the lardons are threaded onto the surface, and interior larding, in which the lardons are left in a channel (made with a larger-sized needle than is used for studding) inside the meat. Madame St. Ange recommends larding for braised calf's sweetbreads (as does the French Laundry cookbook) and for a specific style of cooking hare. American food writer James Peterson specifically recommends using fatback for larding; salt pork, he says, [...] "has a funny taste and won't work". [...] Julia Child recommends using lard or porkbellies (pancetta); she too thinks that neither salt pork nor bacon work, and suggests blanching these first, {{to get rid of the}} overwhelming cured or smoked flavors. The origin of larding is in the Middle Ages, when edible meat was sourced from hunting game and was often too lean and tough because of the animal's natural physical activity; larding provided the equivalent of today's marbling.|$|R
