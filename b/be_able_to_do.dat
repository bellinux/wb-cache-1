5|$|East of the NK and ROK 8th Divisions, the NK 12th Division {{crossed the}} Naktong River at Andong, {{moving through the}} {{mountains}} in small groups to reach P'ohang-dong. The division was far under strength {{and at least one}} of its artillery batteries had to send its guns back north because it had no ammunition for them. UN planners had not anticipated that the 12th Division would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this effectively, and thus was unprepared when its forces infiltrated the region so heavily.|$|E
5|$|The global {{nature of}} the war meant that many {{functions}} that were previously vested in the individual Australian state governments had to be placed {{under the control of}} the Commonwealth government. Additionally, the exigencies of the war meant that the government required the power to enact certain laws that under the Constitution it would not normally <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> In order to enable this to occur, the War Precautions Act 1914 was introduced in October 1914, providing the Commonwealth government with wide-ranging powers for a period of up to six months after the duration of the war.|$|E

5|$|A popular product, {{with a lower}} screen {{resolution}} and performance than the two Retina models that followed it but a lighter build and longer battery life, it remained in the Apple line-up as an entry-level iPad model for three years until March 2014, latterly with a silent upgrade to a die-shrunk version of the A5 processor. Its basic design formed {{the core of the}} first iPad mini, which had the same screen pixel count and similar features at a smaller size. The iPad 2 has been able to run six major versions of iOS, from 4 to 9, the only iOS device to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The iPhone 4S is a close second with support from iOS 5 to iOS 9, as well as the iPhone 5, which was supported from iOS 6 to iOS 10.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Wilder {{relocated}} to Paris, accepting {{a leading role}} in Bud Yorkin's Start the Revolution Without Me, a comedy that took place during the French Revolution. After shooting ended, Wilder returned to New York, where he read the script for Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx and immediately called Sidney Glazier, who produced The Producers. Both men began searching for the perfect director for the film. Jean Renoir was the first candidate, but he would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the film for at least a year, so British-Indian director Waris Hussein was hired. With Margot Kidder co-starring with Wilder, it was filmed on location in Dublin, and at the nearby Ardmore Studios, in August and September 1969.|$|E
5|$|Khan, Chopra, and Rampal {{underwent}} extensive {{martial arts}} training from an expert from the Shaolin Temple. The principal cast received training in {{different kinds of}} martial arts. Khan revealed that he {{had always wanted to}} look the way Amitabh Bachchan had in his films, but he said he gave his own interpretation to the role. After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if she would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> justice to the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made a conscious effort to give her own look and style to the character.|$|E

5|$|Casting {{began in}} October 2007, when Priyanka Chopra signed {{to play the}} lead role in the film. Chopra {{initially}} refused the role, feeling she would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it justice. Six months later, she agreed {{to appear in the}} film because of Bhandarkar's confidence in her. The media reported that Chopra was unhappy with the first draft of the film and wanted script changes before signing the film. Bhandarkar was also unhappy with the first draft and agreed to rewrite the script. Kangana Ranaut was cast as the film's second lead; she was pleased with the script and found it challenging, interesting and exciting. In December 2007, Arbaaz Khan and Arjan Bajwa were cast opposite Chopra. After confirming the principal cast, the media reported that Bhandarkar was having difficulty casting the male roles, including that of a homosexual clothing designer. Samir Soni and Harsh Chhaya were cast as the homosexual designers, and model Mugdha Godse was cast in a supporting role. According to Godse, Bhandarkar offered her a part when they were shooting a jewellery advertisement; a year later, she agreed to appear in the film. The Hindustan Times said that several models and designers played themselves, giving the film the appearance of a documentary.|$|E
5|$|During the {{beginning}} of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had re-introduced the draft (conscription) in September 1940, and Koval registered for it on January 2, 1941. Raven Electric Company secured him a year's deferment from service until February 1942. According to historian Vladimir Lota, Koval's handlers wanted him to steal information about chemical weapons, and felt {{that he would not}} <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so while drafted. When the deferment expired, Koval was inducted into the United States Army. He received basic training at Fort Dix in New Jersey before being sent to the Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina. There, Koval served as a private in the 3410th Specialized Training and Reassignment Unit. On August 11, 1943, he was transferred to the Army Specialized Training Program, a unit established in December 1942 to provide talented enlistees with an education and technical training. Koval attended the City College of New York (CCNY) and studied electrical engineering. His CCNY classmates looked up to the older Koval as a role model and father figure who never did homework and was a noted ladies' man, never knowing about his Soviet education and wife. Colleagues recalled that he never discussed politics or the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Ripley's {{performance}} in the first series won her a nomination for Best TV Comedy Actress at the British Comedy Awards 1999. For her {{performance in}} the third series (2000), in which her character separates from her husband and dates another man (played by Ben Miles), she was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress. During pre-production of the fourth series (2001), Ripley announced to the producers {{that she would be}} leaving the show, partly because {{she did not want to}} spend five months living in Manchester away from her home in London and wanted to spend more time with her husband, and partly to take other roles which she would otherwise not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> She asked the writer Mike Bullen to either kill off Jenny or have her lose a limb. Bullen refused and instead wrote a plot in which Jenny moves to New York. Ripley returned to the series for a guest appearance in the final episode (2003). She had originally planned not to return to the show, but reprised the role so she could have an on-screen record of the final stages of her pregnancy with her first child.|$|E

5|$|Players {{have access}} to a {{communication}} system {{that can be used to}} contact other starfighters, which has more impact in the game's single-player mode. Through the system, the player can order either a single starfighter, a wing, or all craft (depending on how many are still active), with tasks such as taking down a player's target, covering the player, or engaging all hostiles, amongst other commands. The system can also be used to call in for reinforcements (if available), and requesting deployment of a support ship to repair a player's subsystems as well as re-arm their secondary weapons; the support ship can be given limited orders when deployed. Furthermore, a player can manage the energy input of certain subsystems, thus affecting how efficient it is in battle; changing the input for engines, for example, changes the max speed of the craft and the time needed to fully recharge the ship's afterburners. The controls for the game in both modes are designed so that players have ease with controlling their starfighter and its systems, and <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so with either a joystick, or a keyboard (on its own or with a mouse). Because of the flexibility in controls, some have categorised Descent: FreeSpace as a flight simulator, since it has more controls and commands than a typical arcade game, yet its flight model is simple, akin to that of the game , and incorporates some elements of Newtonian physics such as precise collision physics.|$|E

They were given access to the Episode II script and concept art early on before the film came out. LucasArts created storyboarded scripts of their cutscenes and gave them to ILM, who developed them into cinematic cutscenes. Knoles envisioned the level layouts and then consulted with lead level designer David Wehr and his level designers. They created a bubble map of the levels which they worked from to determine details in what the player would face and <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> The team made a new engine for the game to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what they wanted. The graphic designers worked concurrently with the level designers to create the environments, which the level designers then used to better visualize what they were trying to do.
