5|$|The {{consumption}} of parsnips has potential health <b>benefits.</b> <b>They</b> contain antioxidants such as falcarinol, falcarindiol, panaxydiol, and methyl-falcarindiol, which may potentially have anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. The dietary fiber in parsnips is partly of the soluble and partly the insoluble type and comprises cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The high fiber content of parsnips {{may help prevent}} constipation and reduce blood cholesterol levels.|$|E
5|$|Despite the dissatisfaction {{of the men}} in the SWPA, the {{demobilisation}} and repatriation process generally proceeded smoothly. Most men {{had been}} returned to Australia by January 1946 and 80 percent were demobilised by the middle of the year. Before leaving the military service men and women attended either a dispersal centre or naval depot where they were provided with a medical examination, interviewed by a rehabilitation officer and provided with information about the <b>benefits</b> <b>they</b> were eligible for. The Manpower Directorate was then responsible for placing discharged personnel in employment as well as providing them with identity documentation and ration entitlements. Training courses were made available to veterans, and by 1951 94,000 had completed university, technical or rural training courses and 39,000 were still in training. A further 135,000 began training but withdrew before completing their course.|$|E
5|$|Lured by {{numerous}} incentives {{such as food}} coupons, better housing and other <b>benefits,</b> <b>they</b> were received coldly by the Armenians living in the Republic upon their arrival. The repatriates spoke the Western Armenian dialect, instead of the Eastern Armenian spoken in Soviet Armenia. They were often addressed as aghbars ("brothers") by Armenians living in the republic, due to their different pronunciation of the word. Although initially used in humor, the word went on {{to carry on a}} more pejorative connotation. Their treatment by the Soviet government was not much better. A number of Armenian immigrants in 1946 had their belongings confiscated upon arrival at Odessa's port, as they had taken with them everything they had, including clothes and jewelry. This was the first disappointment experienced by Armenians; however, as there was no possibility of return the Armenians were forced to continue their journey to Armenia. Many of the immigrants were targeted by Soviet intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Interior for real or perceived ties to Armenian nationalist organizations, and were later sent to labor camps in Siberia and elsewhere, where they would not be released until after Stalin's death.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Susan is dismayed {{to learn}} that Karl has moved in with Edie. She begins dating her doctor, Ron McCready (Jay Harrington), who informs her {{that she has a}} {{wandering}} spleen and will need a splenectomy. When Susan learns that her health insurance will not cover the operation, Karl offers to remarry her for his medical <b>benefits.</b> <b>They</b> agree to keep their sham marriage a secret from Edie and Ron. While under anesthesia before her operation, Susan professes her love for Mike to Ron, which prompts Ron to break up with her. Soon after, Karl leaves Edie, as his love for Susan has resurfaced. Upon learning that Susan is the other woman, Edie intentionally sets Susan's house on fire. In this time of need, both Mike and Karl vie for Susan's affections. She chooses to rekindle her relationship with Mike and Karl signs the divorce papers. Susan and Mike then make plans to meet for dinner at nearby Torch Lake, where Mike plans to propose. On his way to dinner, Mike is a victim of a hit-and-run at the hands of Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan), a dentist whom Susan had recently befriended.|$|E

25|$|Wikipedia's initial anarchy {{integrated}} {{democratic and}} hierarchical elements over time. An article {{is not considered}} to be owned by its creator or any other editor and is not vetted by any recognized authority.

25|$|Because of the {{economic}} ramifications of such restrictions, there are those, including the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, who argue that the negative economic effects of emission controls outweigh the environmental <b>benefits.</b> <b>They</b> state that even if global warming is caused solely by the burning of fossil fuels, restricting their use would have more damaging effects on the world economy than the increases in global temperature.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the bid, those {{involved}} in British sport were hopeful that there would also be a 2012 legacy of increased commitment to sport in the UK, with the social and health <b>benefits</b> <b>they</b> believe that could bring, but {{it will be difficult to}} assess whether or not this really happens.

25|$|While Newcomen engines brought {{practical}} <b>benefits,</b> <b>they</b> were inefficient {{in terms}} of the use of energy to power them. The system of alternately sending jets of steam, then cold water into the cylinder meant that the walls of the cylinder were alternately heated, then cooled with each stroke. Each charge of steam introduced would continue condensing until the cylinder approached working temperature once again. So at each stroke part of the potential of the steam was lost.|$|E
25|$|The game rewards {{the player}} with {{experience}} points as they complete objectives and defeat enemies. The player can gain experience levels, each level boosting basic {{attributes of the}} character. These experience levels grant the player skills such as improved gunfire precision or damage resistance. Special rewards such as revealing the full map and unlimited special ammo are granted at specific levels. When the player starts a new game, they will lose all the weapons and items that they have acquired, but will keep the character's experience level and any <b>benefits</b> <b>they</b> have already received from that experience.|$|E
25|$|Veterinary {{associations}} {{such as the}} American Veterinary Medical Association, British Veterinary Association and Canadian Veterinary Medical Association {{have warned}} of the animal and public health risk that could arise from feeding raw meat to pets and have stated {{that there is no}} scientific evidence to support the claimed benefits of raw feeding. While lack of favorable evidence can result from lack of long-term studies investigating the effect of eating a balanced raw diet, a minority of holistic-oriented veterinarians recommend raw feeding because of clear health <b>benefits</b> <b>they</b> observed over the years in raw fed dogs. Dr Tom Lonsdale in Australia has been a long-time and prominent veterinary advocate of raw feeding.|$|E
50|$|Problems {{can occur}} {{if the company}} {{implementing}} a new SDP system does not outline a realistic sales approach to roadmap the process.

25|$|During working years, the low wage {{worker is}} {{eligible}} for the Earned Income Tax Credit (FICA refunds) and federal child credits and may pay little or no FICA tax or Income tax. By Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculations the lowest income quintile (0–20%) and second quintile (21–40%) of households in the U.S. pay an average income tax of -9.3% and -2.6% and Social Security taxes of 8.3% and 7.9% respectively. By CBO calculations the household incomes in the first quintile and second quintile have an average Total Federal Tax rate of 1.0% and 3.8% respectively. Higher income retirees {{will have to pay}} income taxes on 85% of their Social Security benefits and 100% on all other retirement <b>benefits</b> <b>they</b> may have.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{assumptions}} underlie their game theoretic model, {{and allow for}} the authors' simplified model of society. First, Acemoglu and Robinson assume that society is simply divided between a small rich class and a large poor class. Second, they assume that regimes must be either democratic or nondemocratic; {{there is nothing in}} between. Third, people's preferences in society are defined only by monetary redistribution from the rich ruling class. The more monetary <b>benefits</b> <b>they</b> get, the more they prefer the ruling class. Fourth, people care not only about redistribution today but also redistribution in the future. Therefore, people would not only want more redistribution today but also they want to see a guarantee for more or stable redistribution in the future. Fifth, the economic output of a country fluctuates year by year, which means revolution is less costly for the ruling class during economic downturn. Finally and most importantly, each individual in the society tries to maximize their own utility.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, as {{a result}} of social workers' {{training}} in counseling and their experience in helping their clients with accessing benefits such as unemployment insurance and disability <b>benefits,</b> <b>they</b> are particularly well-suited to help individuals and families learn how to become financially self-sufficient. That said, {{there is a need for}} additional training vis a vis social workers in the financial household management arena. Under some conditions, a raise may trigger reductions in several benefits; therefore, it would be beneficial for social workers to study a financial education curriculum tailored for social workers such as financial social work to fully understand and explain the possible ramifications to clients. In addition, social workers often work with low-income or low to middle-income people who are either unbanked (do not have a banking account) or underbanked (individuals who have a bank account but tend to rely on high cost non-bank providers for their financial transactions). Social workers who have an understanding of financial institutions would be able to guide individuals and families to use mainstream financial institutions and thereby hold onto more of their income and spend less on high cost non-bank financial services.|$|E
50|$|In {{the initial}} stage Balaji Group {{had set up}} their plant at Aji Vasad (Industrial Zone, Rajkot) with their new concept of making potato chips.

5000|$|A common {{criticism}} of trade associations is that, {{while they are}} not per se [...] "profit-making" [...] organizations that claim to do valuable work which is ultimately for the public <b>benefit,</b> <b>they</b> are in reality fronts for price-fixing cartels and other subtle anti-competitive activities {{that are not in}} the public interest.|$|R
50|$|The Thai Children’s Trust {{does not}} open {{projects}} of its own. It is their policy to always operate through local organisation.
