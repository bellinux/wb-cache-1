50|$|The {{management}} of business continuity falls largely within {{the sphere of}} quality management and risk management, with some cross-over into related fields such as governance, information security and compliance. Risk management is an important tool for business continuity as it provides a structured way to identify the sources of <b>business</b> <b>disruption</b> and assess their probability and harm. It is expected that all business functions, operations, supplies, systems, relationships, etc. that are critically important to achieve the organization's operational objectives are analyzed and included in the business continuity plan.

A charcoal house, saltpeter refinery, wheel mills, press mills, kernelling mills, glazing mills, and storehouses were dispersed along both banks of the river and canal for a mile upstream of Gambo to minimize damage during infrequent explosions. Charcoal was manufactured from dried, debarked alder packed into cast iron retorts. Charcoal was made from willow, poplar or maple when alder was unavailable. Crude saltpeter was dissolved in hot water in kettles holding as much as [...] Impurities were skimmed from the surface or settled to the bottom so a hot, saturated solution could be decanted for crystallization. Moist saltpeter crystals were mixed with appropriate amounts of sulfur and charcoal by heavy rotating wheels to form a cake which was then cut unto smaller pieces in bronze- or zinc-toothed kernelling mills. The kernels were sieved into desired sizes and dried prior to being tumbled with graphite which reduced tendency for the finished grains to stick together during storage. Intermediate products were transported between the dispersed production and storage facilities in wooden wheelbarrows constructed with no iron parts and pushed over plank walkways by workmen going barefoot in the summer or wearing shoes without iron nails during colder weather. Newhall gave his name to a small company town of employee residences built near Gambo Falls. [...] Company offices were in Portland, Maine to avoid <b>business</b> <b>disruption</b> by the periodic explosions at the manufacturing facilities.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a systems {{perspective on the}} trends anticipated in the global automotive industry {{and their impact on}} the industry value chain. The global trends which are the emergent properties of the automotive industry, their effects, and the corresponding challenges that they bring to the automotive companies are analyzed in the thesis. These changes have also been used as a base to identify the constraints and the opportunities that are foreseen ahead for the automotive companies. The 3 global trends that have been analyzed in detail are - technology advancement which is leading to disruptive innovation, changing consumer behavior from 'owning to sharing cars' which is leading to <b>business</b> <b>disruptions,</b> and finally the emergence of the East which marks the entry of Chinese companies as global car makers. The analysis of each global trend has been supplemented with a case study to better understand their effects. For analyzing technology disruptions, autonomous vehicle technology has been studied. From improving traffic safety and increasing driving speed, to reducing travel times, traffic congestion, energy consumption- self-driving cars can be beneficial in many ways. However, the operating environment for autonomous vehicles is a large complex sociotechnical system that must integrate existing legacy and future transportation systems. Successful implementation will need to consider social aspects- both from an individual's personal preferences, and also from the perspective of various global laws and regulations. To better understand this part, a systems analysis on implementing autonomous vehicles is presented in case study 1. The <b>business</b> <b>disruptions</b> in the industry have been studied through the lens of Uber's business development and strategy which is highlighted in case study 2. To study the emergence of Chinese car makers in the global automotive market, Qoros Automotive Co. Ltd is analyzed through case study 3. This case describes the significant role of the East in the future. These mega trends present the big auto companies with constraints and opportunities in terms of redeveloping competencies, innovating, and redeveloping internal capabilities.

This session will present a model for addressing business continuity and share various principles and effective practices obtained from in-depth case study research of leading-edge firms. The Opportunity. All business organizations {{are exposed to}} operational risk. Most managers, when they think about such risk, {{tend to focus on}} those risks that affect internal operations. Accidents, natural disasters, and intentional malicious acts all have the potential to seriously disrupt or shut down internal operations. While critical, all risks are not internal. Increasingly, as more firms begin to rely on the supply chain and the capabilities of their suppliers, managers and researchers are coming to realize the true impact of supply-side disruptions (Zsidisin, 2003; Barnes 2001; Gilbert and Gips 2000). <b>Business</b> failures, <b>disruptions</b> or shutdowns among a firm’s suppliers or in its inbound logistics channels can easily create a ripple effect of business interruptions throughout the supply chain. They can also seriously and strategically impact overall performance. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} a formalized system that identifies such risks, qualifies the associated risks and then provides procedures...|$|R
