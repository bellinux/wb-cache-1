This gives faster heat {{up of the}} engine coolant which in turn heats up the engine faster. Less choke is used giving reduced emissions and fuel consumption. This will also quicken cabin heating warm up for passenger comfort and window defrosting. For hybrid applications it also can warm the battery pack. The cooling system is connected to a heat exchanger placed in the exhaust gas transferring the thermal energy from the exhaust gas to the cooling system.

40|$|Authors have {{proposed}} {{a new type of}} vibration suppression device that utilizes variable inertia mass by fluid which acts as a series inertia mass. The series inertia mass is proportional to not only square of a ratio between a diameter of a piston cylinder and a <b>by-pass</b> <b>pipe,</b> and also a density of the fluid. The resisting force characteristics in case of water or turbine oil were measured. To confirm the proposed theory and investigate effects of vibration control, vibration tests of frequency response and seismic response of one-degree-of-freedom system with the test device were carried out. The experimental results were compared with the calculated results, and the effects of vibration suppression are confirmed experimentally and theoretically. In this paper, in order to derive the effect of a variable inertia mass by using a magnet-rheological fluid, resisting force characteristics of the test device are measured in several cases of magnetic field. The orifice of the <b>by-pass</b> <b>pipe</b> can be changed in virtual, since some rare-earth magnets are installed around the <b>by-pass</b> <b>pipe.</b> It can be seen from experimental results that the inertia force is increasing as stronger magnetic fields. It is pointed out that the variable inertia mass can be derived since clustered magnetic particles in the <b>by-pass</b> <b>pipe</b> act as a virtual orifice under strong magnetic field. The relation between magnetic flux and variable inertia mass are estimated experimentally...|$|E

We try to assess the efficiency of pump operation control by using a numerical model created in EPANET for a 24 hours period. To avoid the demand driven algorithm used by EPANET, the network model consists of a throttle control valve followed by an emitter. Pump or valves parameters are modified using control statements.

40|$|The {{operating}} temperature of a loop heat pipe (LHP) {{is governed by}} the saturation temperature of its compensation chamber (CC); the latter is in turn determined by the balance among the heat leak from the evaporator to the CC, the amount of subcooling carried by the liquid returning to the CC, {{and the amount of}} heat exchanged between the CC and ambient. The LHP {{operating temperature}} can be controlled at a desired set point by actively controlling the CC temperature. The most common method is to cold bias the CC and use electric heater power to maintain the CC set point temperature. The required electric heater power can be large when the condenser sink is very cold. Several methods have been developed to reduce the control heater power, including coupling block, heat exchanger and separate subcooler, variable conductance heat <b>pipe,</b> <b>by-pass</b> valve with pressure regulator, secondary evaporator, and thermoelectric converter.

40|$|The {{invention}} discloses {{a system}} and a method for controlling water discharge. The method for controlling water discharge comprises the following steps of: starting a water discharge control system; collecting a water discharge value inside a <b>by-pass</b> <b>pipe</b> in a secondary pump chilled water system of a central air conditioner, and a near-end pressure differential value and a far-end pressure differential value of a use side in the secondary pump chilled water system of the central air conditioner; determining the maximal near-end pressure differential set value of the user side; determining the near-end pressure differential set value of the user side; comparing the collected near-end pressure differential value with the determined near-end pressure differential set value, and adjusting operating parameters of the secondary pump {{on the basis of}} a comparison result, and finishing the adjusting process of the secondary pump. The operating parameters of the secondary pump can be adjusted by virtue of the system and the method for controlling water discharge, so that the water discharge in a water supply pipe of the user side in the chilled water system of the central air conditioner is adjusted; and the condition that the water discharge inside a water return pipe of the user side is not greater than that in the water supply pipe of a host side is ensured, and reverse backflow in the <b>by-pass</b> <b>pipe</b> is prevented finally. 本发明公开了一种水流量控制系统及方法，所述水流量控制方法包括执行以下步骤：启动所述水流量控制系统；采集中央空调二次泵冷冻水系统中旁通管内的水流量值以及中央空调二次泵冷冻水系统中用户侧的近端压差值和远端压差值；确定用户侧的最大近端压差设定值；确定用户侧的近端压差设定值；比较采集的近端压差值与确定的近端压差设定值，并基于比较结果调整二次泵的运行参数；二次泵的调整过程结束。通过该水流量控制系统及方法可以调整二次泵的运行参数，从而调节中央空调冷冻水系统中用户侧供水管中的水流量，确保用户侧回水管中的水流量不大于主机侧供水管中的水流量，最终防止旁通管中逆向回流的发生。Department of Building Services EngineeringInventor name used in this publication: 王盛卫Title in Traditional Chinese: 水流量控制系統及方法Chin...|$|E
40|$|Thermoacoustic {{systems can}} either {{generate}} acoustic work (i. e., p-v work) from thermal energy, or consume acoustic work to transfer heat from low to high temperature sources. They are the so-called thermoacoustic prime movers or heat pumps, essentially {{acting as the}} acoustical equivalents of Stirling engines or coolers. If a travelling sound wave propagates through a regenerator with a positive temperature gradient along the direction of sound wave propagation, the gas parcels experience a Stirling-like thermodynamic cycle. As such, thermal energy {{can be converted to}} acoustic power. Similar to Stirling engines and thermo-fluidic oscillators, thermoacoustic engines can be externally heated with various heat sources and are capable of utilising low-grade thermal energy such as industrial waste heat and solar thermal energy. Both the simplicity, and even the absence of moving parts of thermoacoustic engines demonstrate that they have the potential for developing low-cost power generators therefore, they have attracted significant research effort for developing coolers or electric generators. The target design principle of a thermoacoustic engine is to maximise acoustic power production within the thermoacoustic core whilst minimising the acoustic losses in the resonator. One of the main issues with current thermoacoustic systems is low efficiency, which is largely attributed to acoustic losses in the resonator and the regenerator. There would be {{a significant impact on the}} thermoacoustic field if a suitable travelling wave resonator were developed with the least losses. Despite the different engine configurations for developing these engines, they all work on the same thermodynamic principle, i. e., the Stirling cycle. In this study, the first issue is resolved by employing a by-pass configuration, and the second is addressed by using a side-branched volume technique. The current study focuses on the investigation of looped-tube travelling-wave thermoacoustic engines with a <b>by-pass</b> <b>pipe.</b> The novelty of such a by-pass configuration is that the by-pass and feedback pipes actually create a pure travelling wave resonator. The engine unit extracts a small amount of acoustic work from the resonator, amplifies it and sends it back to it. As the pure travelling wave resonator has very low losses, it requires very little acoustic power to sustain an acoustic resonance. This idea is analogous to children playing on swings, where a small push could sustain the swinging for a long time. The present research demonstrates that travelling wave thermoacoustic engines with such a by-pass configuration can achieve comparable performances with other types of travelling wave thermoacoustic engines which have been intensively researched. According to the results, this type of engine essentially operates on the same thermodynamic principle as other travelling wave thermoacoustic engines, differing only in the design of the acoustic resonator. The looped-tube travelling-wave thermoacoustic engine with a <b>by-pass</b> <b>pipe</b> was then implemented in the design of an engine with a much longer regenerator and higher mean pressure to increase its power density. A thermoacoustic cooler was also coupled to the engine to utilise its acoustic power, allowing evaluation of thermal efficiency. A linear alternator has also been coupled to the tested engine to develop an electric generator. This research additionally addresses the effect of a side-branched Helmholtz resonator to tune the phase in looped- tube travelling wave thermoacoustic engine. This action is performed in order to obtain the correct time-phasing between the acoustic velocity and pressure oscillations within the regenerator, to force gas parcels to execute a Stirling-like thermodynamic cycle, so that thermal energy can be converted to mechanical work (i. e., high-intensity pressure waves). By changing its volume one can change the acoustic impedance at the opening of the Helmholtz resonator, and thus adjust the acoustic field within the loop-tubed engine. It can essentially shunt away part of the volumetric velocity at the low impedance region of the engine, so that the acoustic loss can be reduced within the engine. Both the simulations and the experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed side-branched volume can effectively adjust the acoustic field within the looped-tube engine and affect its performance. There is an optimal acoustic compliance corresponding to the best performance in terms of acoustic power output and energy efficiency when the heating power input is fixed...|$|E
40|$|Slugging {{involves}} {{pressure and}} flowrate fluctuations and poses {{a major threat}} to optimising oil production from deepwater reserves. Typical production loss could be as high as 50 %, affecting the ability to meet growing energy demand. This work is based on numerical simulation using OLGA (OiL and GAs) a one- dimensional and two-fluid equations based commercial tool for the simulation and analysis of a typical field case study in West Africa. Numerical model was adopted for the field case. Based on the field report, Flow Loop X 1 consisted of well X 1 and well X 2, (where X 1 is the well at the inlet and X 2 is the well connected from the manifold (MF)). Slugging was experienced at Flow Loop X 1 at 3000 BoPD; 4 MMScf/D and 3 %W/C. This study investigated the conditions causing the slugging and the liquid and gas phase behaviour at the period slugging occurred. The simulation work involved modelling the boundary conditions (heat transfer, ambient temperature, mass flowrate e. t. c). Also critical was the modelling of the piping diameter, pipe length, wall thickness and wall type material to reflect the field geometry. Work on flow regime transition chart showed that slugging became more significant from 30 % water-cut, especially at the riser base for a downward inclined flow on the pipeline- riser system. Studies on diameter effect showed that increasing diameter from 8 ” – 32 ” gave rise to a drop in Usg (superficial velocity gas) and possible accumulation of liquids on the riser- base position and hence a tendency for slugging formation. Depth effect study showed that increasing depth gave rise to increasing pressure fluctuation, especially at the riser- base. Studies on the Self-Lift slug mitigation approach showed that reducing the internal diameter of the Self-lift <b>by-pass</b> <b>pipe</b> was effective in mitigating slug flow. S 3 (Slug suppression system) was also investigated for deepwater scenario, with the results indicating a production benefit of 12. 5 %. In summary, the work done identified water-cut region where pipeline-riser systems become more susceptible to slugging. Also, two key up-coming slug mitigation strategies were studied and their performance evaluated in-view of production enhancement...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Transfer chutes {{are used}} {{extensively}} in belt conveyor systems {{to ensure the}} material loaded is discharged in a centralised stream {{and in the same}} direction as the receiving conveyor. As concerns arise for the environment and occupational health and safety, the control of dust emissions from the belt conveyor system is a matter of high importance. Therefore, the performance of transfer chutes has a significant impact on not only the efficiency of conveyor belt systems, but on the level of fugitive dust emissions. The work presented investigates the feasibility of using a simulation method to predict the performance of transfer chutes, thereby achieving a better design. Scale model tests are carried out to provide the necessary information for the verification of the simulation results. Totally, there are six different chute configurations involved in the scale model tests. Several available simulation methods are applied to model the granular flow in transfer chutes, where both the advantages and disadvantages for each method are presented and discussed. A two-phase CFD simulation method is considered as a compromise solution, involving a mixture of the accuracy, time consumption and ease of use considerations. The appropriate models and modelling parameters of the two-phase CFD method for this particular system are determined according to the experimental results. Further potential to improve the design obtained from the results of scale model tests is investigated using simulation. The influences of the height of the stilling chamber, the length of the stilling chamber and the pattern of the curtains inside the stilling chamber on reducing dust emissions are briefly discussed and the effects of the control flap and the <b>by-pass</b> <b>pipe</b> are also investigated. The results reveal that the pattern of curtains placed has a great influence on lowering the air velocity at the chute outlet. The feasibility of the two-phase CFD on full scale transfer chute modelling is verified using results from site tests. The results indicate that the transfer chute performance regarding dust emission can be predicted by this method, providing a powerful design tool when used in conjunction with other methods used to analyse the transfer chute from a bulk material flow perspective...|$|E
