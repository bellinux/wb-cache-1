5|$|I {{know why}} the caged bird sings, ah me,When his wing is bruised and his <b>bosom</b> sore,When he beats his bars and would be free;It is not a carol of joy or glee,But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings— I {{know why the}} caged bird sings.|$|E
5|$|Some ignorant clerics reject {{calculations}} {{of this kind}} (for shame!) and {{do not wish to}} keep their phylacteries, that is, they do not preserve the order, which they have received in the <b>bosom</b> of mother church, nor do they persist in the holy teaching of meditation. They should consider carefully the way of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and they should spit out their doctrine like filth. A cleric ought to be the keeper of his own soul, just as a noble man subjects a young foal to the yoke, so he ought to subject his own soul to service, by filling the alabaster box with precious oil, that is, he ought to be inwardly subjected daily, by obeying the divine laws and admonitions of the Redeemer.|$|E
5|$|Parvati has a well-developed, round <b>bosom</b> and {{a narrow}} {{feminine}} waist embellished with various haras (religious bracelets) and other ornaments, made of diamonds and other gems. She has a fuller thigh and a curvier body and hip than the male {{part of the}} icon. The torso, hip and pelvis of the female is exaggerated to emphasize the anatomical differences between the halves. Though the male private parts may be depicted, the female genitalia are never depicted and the loins are always draped. She wears a multi-coloured or white silken garment down to her ankle and one or three girdles around her waist. The left half wears an anklet and her foot is painted red with henna. The left leg may be somewhat bent or straight, resting on a lotus pedestal. In contrast to the Shiva half, the Parvati half – smeared with saffron – is described as calm and gentle, parrot-green or dark in colour. She may be draped in a sari covering her torso and legs.|$|E

5|$|Tom Hanks is an American {{actor and}} {{producer}} {{who has had}} an extensive career in films, television and on the stage. Hanks made his professional acting debut on the stage playing Grumio, in the Great Lakes Theater production of The Taming of the Shrew (1977). He made his film debut with a minor role in the horror film He Knows You're Alone (1980). In the same year, Hanks appeared in the television series <b>Bosom</b> Buddies. His role in the show led to guest appearances {{on a variety of}} long running television shows including Happy Days. Hanks' appearance on the show led film director Ron Howard to cast him in his first leading role in the fantasy romantic comedy Splash (1984). He went on to host Saturday Night Live {{for the first time in}} 1985 (a show he has since hosted nine times as of 2016), star in films such as Nothing in Common (1986) and Dragnet (1987) before playing his breakthrough role in the age-changing comedy Big (1988).

25|$|Several of Lightvessels {{had been}} sunk along the coast, the vessels were {{tethered}} and the Trinity House crews could not manoeuvre. Radar usually picked up enemy raiders {{before they reached}} the target area but in poor light, the ships were very vulnerable. Both Keith Park and Leigh-Mallory were concerned the Luftwaffe would attack lightships off the East Coast {{and they decided to}} put up aerial patrols over the coast near their anchorages. Convoy <b>Bosom</b> sailed from Lyme Bay and Hurricanes from 238 Squadron chased off three Bf109s; the Hurricanes spotted a Seenotflugkommando 4 He59 ambulance at 14:30 and shot it down, killing the four crew. As <b>Bosom</b> steamed eastwards, another He 59 from Seenotflugkommando 1 arrived and shadowed the convoy and was attacked by 43 Squadron. A Hurricane was shot down and the pilot bailed out but drowned and the He 59 escaped into cloud. Aircraft from 601 Squadron took over and the Heinkel was shot down; the crew bailed out too low and their parachutes failed to open. As <b>Bosom</b> reached the RAF Kenley and RAF Biggin Hill sectors, there had been plenty of time for the He 59s to report it and Park ordered standing patrols of 24 fighters over <b>Bosom,</b> split evenly between Spitfire and Hurricane units.|$|E
