500|$|García Márquez's grandmother, Doña Tranquilina Iguarán Cotes, {{played an}} {{influential}} {{role in his}} upbringing. He was inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> [...] "treated the extraordinary as something perfectly natural." [...] The house was filled with stories of ghosts and premonitions, omens and portents, {{all of which were}} studiously ignored by her husband. According to García Márquez she was [...] "the source of the magical, superstitious and supernatural view of reality". He enjoyed his grandmother's unique way of telling stories. No matter how fantastic or improbable her statements, she always delivered {{them as if they were}} the irrefutable truth. It was a deadpan style that, some thirty years later, heavily influenced her grandson's most popular novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude.|$|E
500|$|Biographer Mary Cross {{noted in}} her book Madonna: A Biography, how the song {{paved the way for}} its music video and became a {{testament}} to freedom. Authors Allen Metz and Carol Benson noted in their essays on Madonna, how she decimated [...] "patriarchal, racist and capitalist constructions", <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> pronounced the word [...] "self" [...] in [...] "Express Yourself". They added that the opening line [...] "Don't go for second best, baby" [...] transformed the song into a postmodernist anthem. Scholar Sheila Whiteley noted {{in her book}} Women and Popular Music: Sexuality, Identity, and Subjectivity, that Madonna's acknowledgement of the pastiche and of being capable of imitating musical style was interesting to her, but given Madonna's ability to manipulate image, the musical exuberance of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] did not appear surprising. Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blond Ambition declared that [...] "the song that most reflected the Madonna everyone had come to know and be shocked by was 'Express Yourself'." [...] O'Brien was impressed with the song, and gave a detailed review: ...|$|E
6000|$|But at {{this point}} the ostlers came hurrying out of the stables. [...] "She's comin'," [...] said one. [...] "That's her dust just behind <b>the</b> Lone Pine--and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she's</b> racin' I reckon she's comin' in mighty light." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No names, please. I'm {{known as}} Mr. Carter here. It's my cousin's house, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>She's</b> willing to lend {{it to me}} {{sometimes}} when it's a case of working on strictly unofficial lines. Well, now"--he looked {{from one to the}} other--"who's going to tell me the story?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] he responded, [...] "I guess {{quite a few}} done no {{more than}} make their folks {{on the other side}} tired of them, and that's why they sent them out to you. Some of them get paid so much on {{condition}} that they don't come back again. Say"--and he glanced toward the dancers--"Dick Creighton's Sally seems quite stuck on Hawtrey <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she's</b> looking at him." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Smile" [...] was {{met with}} mixed to {{positive}} reviews from music critics. According to Heather Phares of Allmusic, the song [...] "has a silky verse melody that just barely conceals [...] spite", while she keeps [...] "her revenge sweet, the extra sting being given to it <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> sounds like she's singing about how ice cream or puppies or being in love makes her smile". Blender reporter Jon Dolan claims that Allen [...] "deploys a sugary melody as a Trojan horse for a smackdown on a douche-bag ex-boyfriend", as Rob Webb from Drowned in Sound called [...] "Smile" [...] an [...] "infectious slice of bouncing, carnival reggae that punches hard with its opening line: 'When you first left me / I was wanting more / But you were fucking that girl next door / What you do that for?,'" [...] {{and went on to}} say that the theme of the song is melancholy, [...] "set against breezy beats", and while not being [...] "an obvious TOTP contender on the surface, [...] is good but far from one of the LP's choice cuts". Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone gave a rather negative review, claiming the singer [...] "doesn't sound as if she's trying too hard", singing the song with a [...] "breezy sha-la-la lilt that just made the song seem even nastier". Later, he called Allen a [...] "theoretical pop princess, who just entered the breakup-song hall of fame". Dom Passantino of Stylus suggested that [...] "'Smile' gets burned off the lights by both Sean Paul and Abs when it comes to facsimiles of 'Uptown Top Ranking,' but neither of them could bring the quality of lyricism the singer does," [...] while Slant Magazine reporter Sal Cinquemani was baffled as to why the song, which she [...] "sings without a smirk of irony", is a UK chart-topper.|$|E
2500|$|Wendy Torrance in {{the film}} is {{relatively}} meek, submissive, passive, gentle, and mousy; this is shown <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> defends Jack even in his absence to the doctor examining Danny. It is implied she has perhaps been abused by him as well. In the novel, she {{is a far more}} self-reliant and independent personality who is tied to Jack in part by her poor relationship with her parents. In the novel, she never displays hysteria or collapses the way she does {{in the film}}, but remains cool and self-reliant. Writing in Hollywood's Stephen King, author Tony Magistrale writes about the mini-series remake: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1851, Truth joined George Thompson, an {{abolitionist}} and speaker, on {{a lecture}} tour through central and western New York State. In May, she attended the Ohio Women's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio, where she delivered her famous extemporaneous speech on women's rights, later known as [...] "Ain't I a Woman." [...] Her speech demanded equal human rights {{for all women}} as well as for all blacks. Advocating for women and African Americans was dangerous and challenging enough, but being one and doing so was far more difficult. The pressures and severity of her speech did not get to Truth, however. Truth took to the stage with a demanding and composed presence. Audience members were baffled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> carried herself and were hesitant to believe [...] that she was even a woman, prompting the name of her speech"Ain't I a Woman?" [...] The convention was organized by Hannah Tracy and Frances Dana Barker Gage, who both were present when Truth spoke. Different versions of Truth's words have been recorded, with the first one published a month later in the Anti-Slavery Bugle by Rev. Marius Robinson, the newspaper owner and editor who was in the audience. Robinson's recounting of the speech included no instance of the question [...] "Ain't I a Woman?" [...] Nor did any of the other newspapers reporting of her speech at the time. Twelve years later, in May 1863, Gage published another, very different, version. In it, Truth's speech pattern had characteristics of Southern slaves, and the speech was vastly different then the one Robinson had reported. Gage's version of the speech became the historic standard version, and is known as [...] "Ain't I a Woman?" [...] because that question was repeated four times. It is highly unlikely that Truth's own speech pattern was Southern in nature, as she {{was born and raised in}} New York, and she spoke only upper New York State low-Dutch until she was nine years old.|$|E

60|$|Entering <b>by</b> <b>the</b> back <b>way,</b> <b>she</b> tapped softly {{with the}} key {{at one of the}} cell-doors, and listened. There was no sound within: so she coughed and listened again. Still there was no reply: so she spoke.|$|R

60|$|But {{she walked}} {{with her head}} up, and still did not answer. He could tell <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> moved, as if she didn't care, that she suffered.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps I will,' she said. But at {{this moment}} the yeoman left the house, and Anne, to escape further parley, {{returned}} to the dwelling <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> had come.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not opened yet,' said Mr Chester. 'Dear me! I {{hope the}} aged soul has not caught her foot in some unlucky cobweb <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>She</b> is there at last! Come in, I beg!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So he is," [...] said Bax. [...] "I {{happen to}} know him, though {{he does not know}} me. He is a Scripture reader to sailors (Burton by name), and has spent many years of his life at work on the coast, in the {{neighbourhood}} of Ramsgate. I suppose he was goin' down the coast in the vessel out of which his daughter tumbled. I didn't know he had a daughter. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>she's</b> not a bad one to begin with, Tommy; a regular beauty," [...] continued Bax, with a smile. [...] "You've often wondered whether the first would be a man, or a woman, or a child. The point is settled now!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{picked up}} some toys for her, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> and <b>she</b> shall have them at once to pay for that. I didn't expect to be so graciously {{received}} by this shy mouse," [...] said Mac, much gratified, for Dulce was very chary of her favors.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother Anastasia is very sensible," [...] said I, [...] "and if I were to see her, I {{should be}} happy to express my {{appreciation}} of her good advice upon <b>the</b> subject. And, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> did <b>she</b> {{tell you that it}} was necessary to wear that hot bonnet while you are working?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I rejoined, [...] "I can {{see what}} force she still has <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> grabbed that picture this afternoon. But if she holds you fast how comes it that you are here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Dyott just waited, {{and it had}} the effect, indescribably, {{of making}} {{everything}} that had gone before seem to have {{led up to the}} question. This effect was even deepened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> then said [...] "Whom do you mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I believe I once {{considerably}} scandalised her {{by declaring}} that clear soup {{was a more}} important factor in life than a clear conscience. She had very little sense of proportion. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>she</b> made you her principal heir, didn’t she?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] {{the other}} said; [...] "I know her {{a great deal}} too well for her to try that on. Besides, beyond {{the fact that the}} other was a good-looking girl too--and, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> that <b>she</b> had <b>the</b> same trick of looking full in your face when you spoke--there was no {{resemblance}} whatever between them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She thinks you're Mr. Todd's man. She {{thinks the}} whole place is his, and {{everything}} in it. I don't see what you're to do, except stay on and keep it up. We can't say anything or she'll get on to the whole thing, and I don't want to let Mr. Todd down. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> Jeeves, <b>she</b> wants you to prepare her bed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid not, sir. I {{thought perhaps}} they were keeping her there <b>by</b> force, but <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> acted didn't fit in with that. You see, {{she went back to}} them when she could have got away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't {{make much}} odds as to right or wrong," [...] said Jessie, [...] "but I don't think Mrs. Robson is {{much of a}} lady, to judge <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> gave her orders and flounced off in a huff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Better {{than some}} grown-up women," [...] she said. [...] "She {{sat in my}} room while I dressed the other afternoon. Mrs. Leffingwell had sent her with a note about that French governess. And, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>she</b> speaks French {{as though she had}} lived in Paris." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith, none {{except the}} {{minstrel}} wench, but a household drudge or two whom {{we may not}} dispense with. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>she</b> is anxiously inquiring after the mistress your Highness promised to prefer her to.

60|$|This {{was said}} with no {{appearance}} of cunning or deceit, {{but with an}} unsuspicious frankness that bore the impress of truth. She walked on as before, growing more familiar with me as we proceeded and talking cheerfully <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> but <b>she</b> said no more about her home, beyond remarking {{that we were going}} quite a new road and asking if it were a short one.|$|R
60|$|Laura {{was glad}} that he had asked for the easiest route, for soon after the snow had gone, Nasmyth had broken out a shorter and {{somewhat}} perilous trail over the steepest part of the divide.

60|$|For another misfortune which {{occurred}} in Our Street we {{were much more}} compassionate. We liked Danby Dixon, and his wife Fanny Dixon still more. Miss C. had a paper of biscuits {{and a box of}} preserved apricots always in the cupboard, ready for Dixon's children--provisions <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> which <b>she</b> locked up under Mrs. Cammysole's nose, so that our landlady could by no possibility lay a hand on them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I'm {{bound to}} say I should! I should expect a great deal--everything." [...] And Mrs. Dallow {{emphasised}} this assertion <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> rose erect.

6000|$|MRS. CRASHAW, abandoning Miss Lawton to the ministrations {{of young}} Mr. Bemis, while she kneels beside Mrs. Curwen. and chafes her hand: [...] "Oh, poor thing!

60|$|On {{hands and}} knees he {{followed}} {{her out of the}} tent <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> had come.

6000|$|... "But what regular game Mrs. Poynsett was!" [...] said Herbert. [...] "You {{could not}} make out in the least that she had been left in the lurch; and I'm sure she has a plan, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which <b>she</b> desired Jenny and Edie to come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I go, I want Nellie to go along," [...] {{returned}} the brother.

60|$|Meantime, {{that other}} mother sat by her boy's bed as anxious but with better hope, for Mrs. Minot made trouble sweet and helpful <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which <b>she</b> bore it; and her boys were {{learning}} of {{her how to}} find silver linings to the clouds that must come into the bluest skies.|$|R
