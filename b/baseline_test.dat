Although attitudes towards concussion injuries have been studied, the examination of athletes’ attitudes towards <b>baseline</b> computerized neurocognitive <b>testing</b> is understudied and is warranted. Objective: To {{examine the relationship between}} sex, concussion history, and previous exposure to <b>baseline</b> <b>testing</b> on athletes’ perceptions of effort provided during <b>baseline</b> <b>testing</b> and the utility of neurocognitive testing. Methods: College athletes (18 - 23 years) completing a <b>baseline</b> neurocognitive <b>test</b> (Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Test: ImPACT) were asked to complete an anonymous 33 -item online survey. Survey questions included demographics and inquired about athletes’ effort and utility of baseline and post-concussion neurocognitive testing.

40|$|Item {{response}} {{theory is}} useful in both the development and evaluation of assessments and in computing standardized measures of student performance. In item response theory, individual parameters (difficulty, discrimination) for each item or question are fit by item response models. These parameters provide a means for evaluating a test and offer a better measure of student skill than a raw test score, because each skill calculation considers not only the number of questions answered correctly, but the individual properties of all questions answered. Here, we present the results from {{an analysis of the}} Mechanics <b>Baseline</b> <b>Test</b> given at MIT during 2005 - 2010. Using the item parameters, we identify questions on the Mechanics <b>Baseline</b> <b>Test</b> that are not effective in discriminating between MIT students of different abilities.

40|$|Objective — The Immediate Postconcussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) is a {{computerized}} neuropsychological test battery {{commonly used to}} determine cognitive recovery from concussion based on comparing post-injury scores to baseline scores. This model {{is based on the}} premise that ImPACT <b>baseline</b> <b>test</b> scores are a valid and reliable measure of optimal cognitive function at baseline. Growing evidence suggests that this premise may not be accurate and a large contributor to invalid and unreliable <b>baseline</b> <b>test</b> scores may be the protocol and environment in which baseline tests are administered. This study examined the effects of a standardized environment and administration protocol on the reliability and performance validity of athletes’ <b>baseline</b> <b>test</b> scores on ImPACT by comparing scores obtained in two different group-testing settings. Method — Three hundred-sixty one Division 1 cohort-matched collegiate athletes’ baseline data were assessed using a variety of indicators of potential performance invalidity; internal reliability was also examined. Results — Thirty-one to thirty-nine percent of the baseline cases had at least one indicator of low performance validity, but there were no significant differences in validity indicators based on environment in which the testing was conducted. Internal consistency reliability scores were in the acceptable to good range, with no significant differences between administration conditions.
