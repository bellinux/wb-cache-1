5|$|The core game {{is based}} on Hangman. Each round has a {{category}} and a <b>blank</b> <b>word</b> puzzle, with each blank representing a letter in the answer, and punctuation revealed as needed. Most puzzles are straightforward figures of speech that fit within a mostly static list of categories, and this list has evolved {{over the course of}} the series. Crossword puzzles were added to the rotation in 2016. In such rounds, a clue bonding the words in the puzzle is given instead of a traditional category, and contestants win by solving all the words in the crossword. The titular Wheel of Fortune is a roulette-style wheel mechanism with 24 spaces, most of which are labeled with dollar amounts ranging from $500 to $900, plus a top dollar value: $2,500 in round 1, $3,500 in rounds 2 and 3, and $5,000 for round 4 and any subsequent rounds. The wheel also features two Bankrupt wedges and one Lose a Turn, both of which forfeit the contestant's turn, with the former also eliminating any cash or prizes the contestant has accumulated within the round. Each game features three contestants, or occasionally, three two-contestant teams positioned behind a single scoreboard with its own flipper. The left scoreboard from the viewer's perspective is colored red, the center yellow, and the right blue, with the contestants' positions determined by a random selection prior to taping.|$|E

However, a conjunction follows the blank; the sentence would not be grammatically correct if anything other than a noun were in the <b>blank.</b> The <b>words</b> [...] "milk and eggs" [...] are important for deciding which noun to put in the blank; [...] "supermarket" [...] is a possible answer; depending on the student, however, the first blank could be store, supermarket, shop, market, or grocer while umbrella or raincoat fit the second.|$|R

In this research the writer used two kinds of in-class listening activities, there are listening to a story then filling in the <b>blank</b> <b>words</b> and listening to sentences and interpreting {{the meaning of the}} underline words. This study used pre-experimental design (one group pre-test post-test). The sample of this study is university students’ batch 2016 of English Department who took vocabulary 2 subject. The writer took the data 7 times, there are 1 time pre-test, 5 times treatment, and 1 time post-test. The writer did the treatment in the class which has the lowest mean pre-test. There are 20 students who followed the treatment. The data were analyzed by using T-test. The results of the data analysis are as follows. First, the mean score of the post-test (86, 2) is higher than the pre-test (65, 8). Second, there is {{a significant difference in the}} vocabulary achievement in that group by the T-test results.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 47 - 48) This formatting program {{enables a}} user {{to describe the}} form of a document and to automate many formatting tasks. Input is a stream of characters which are the text of the document interspersed with formatting commands. One input source may be interrupted to insert characters from another source. The program is flexible enough to support experimentation with different types of formatting commands. Several primitive commands are provided to control the formatting process. Users may define macro commands tailored for a specific type of document. Traps may be defined which will automatically invoke a macro each time a specified line is reached on each output page. Text is formatted for -output on a line printer. Optional line justification is accomplished by inserting extra <b>blanks</b> between <b>words</b> and over-printing is used to bold face characters. Extra <b>blanks</b> between <b>words</b> on the input file may be eliminated by the program. Selected variables may be manipulated by the user and their values inserted into the text. The program is written in Fortran and every effort has been made to make it portable. It is currently running on a Control Data 3170 computer...|$|R
5000|$|The lowest {{possible}} score for a bingo is 56.

A 55-point bingo is theoretically possible in tournament play, by making a two-blank play on an empty board that misses the center star.|$|R

After this, students are given a cloze passage testing comprehension as opposed to grammar, which currently has a weight of 15 in which they fill in <b>blanks</b> with <b>words</b> on their own.

Some teachers at language institutes have examined this method of listening improvement {{and at the end of}} the term discerned the outstanding progress in learners’ listening skill. This paper takes two fifteen-learner advanced EFL classes into consideration to find out the extent to which learners’ listening skill can be affected by listening parts they transcribed during the term. In one the classrooms, before listening to the listening sections, learners transcribed them at home beforehand and left a <b>blank</b> for <b>words</b> they couldn’t understand. Then they took those transcriptions to the classroom for revision and filling the blanks. Findings of this study exhibited that those learners who did the job of transcribing during the term could improve their listening skill much more than those who didn’t. This method also helps learners improve their concentration during the listening, their speed of writing, and finally their spelling...|$|R
40|$|English {{language}} {{becomes an}} important language {{in most countries}} such as in Indonesia. One {{of the most important}} skills to master is reading so that students in EFL context need to increase their competence. This research investigates the effects of C-Test technique and Cloze-Elide Test to grade 10 th students of Senior High School. The {{purpose of this study is}} to find out whether Cloze-Elide Test technique or C-Test can also be effectively used in small classroom with 20 students or more. This research was carried out within 5 weeks after the writer passed the teaching practice. The subjects of the study were 77 students at all grade 10 – X-IPS 1 as the Control Group, X-IPS 2 as the Experimental Group and X-MIPA as the Pilot Group. The writer was conducting his experiment at one of the private school in Surabaya. The students in Experimental Group received the Cloze-Elide Test Technique. The students in Control Group received C-Test Technique. The two groups received the same reading test in the pre-test and post-test. There were 40 items in the form of Multiple Choice Items. The time allocation was 40 minutes for each treatment. In the Experimental Group, the students got the Cloze-Elide Test Technique, and they should search the main idea in the original text in every paragraph and later the students should be able to cross out the redundant words on the reading passage. In the Control Group, the students got the C-Test Technique, and they should fill the <b>blank</b> <b>words</b> with appropriate words in pair and later, the students should be able to answer the reading comprehension questions in the reading passage. The estimation time was 45 minutes in each treatment. Comparing the average scores of Pre-Test and Post-Test of both groups showed that there was a significant difference. This study concludes that Cloze-Elide Test Technique does not only improving the vocabulary and grammar mastery, but also get the understanding of the story. Even though the technique might be making the students feel bored, it is a good technique in increasing the students’ reading comprehension...|$|R
