5|$|In 1999, Carpenter {{and colleagues}} {{described}} material {{of a large}} nodosaurid from Utah, discovered in {{a member of the}} Cedar Mountain Formation called the Poison Strip Sandstone, which is contemporaneous with the Cloverly Formation. He originally referred it to Sauropelta as a possible new species, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> named. In more recent publications, Carpenter no longer refers the Poison Strip animal to Sauropelta, only to the family Nodosauridae.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{classical}} planets, Uranus is {{visible to the}} naked eye, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit.

5|$|Mercator {{also added}} {{a feature of}} special value to seamen: from the {{numerous}} compass or wind roses he drew rhumb lines rather than great circles. The rhumb lines correspond to constant sailing directions but on the spherical globe they appear as spirals. The globe was manufactured in great numbers <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> updated. The celestial globe was up to date in using the information provided by Copernicus.|$|E

He was buried in private in the Henry VIII vault alongside the coffins of Henry VIII and Henry's third wife, Jane Seymour, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 9 February 1649. The king's son, Charles II, later planned for an elaborate royal mausoleum to be erected in Hyde Park, London, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> built.|$|E
5|$|The {{fate of the}} D-21 {{that had}} {{disappeared}} on the first operational flight was finally revealed in February 1986 when an official from the CIA returned a panel to Ben Rich {{that he had been}} given by a Soviet KGB agent.

Burnham-on-Sea railway station was the terminus of the Burnham branch of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. It opened in 1858, closed to scheduled passenger traffic in 1951, and stopped being used for excursions in 1962. The former Great Western Railway station {{is now known as}} Highbridge and Burnham. A second pier, built of concrete between 1911 and 1914, is claimed to be the shortest pier in Britain.|$|E

5|$|In 1923 {{his first}} book, How Labour Governs, was {{published}} by the London Labour Company. Examining the Australian Labor Party and its wider connection with the Australian labour movement, it reflect Childe's disillusionment with the party, believing that the politicians that it managed to get elected had abandoned their socialist ideals in favour of personal comfort. Childe's biographer Sally Green noted that How Labour Governs was of particular significance at the time because it was published just as the British Labour Party was emerging as {{a major player in}} British politics, threatening the two-party dominance of the Conservatives and Liberals; in 1924 they were elected to power. Childe had planned a sequel expanding on his ideas, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> published.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 {{the second}} five {{locomotives}} of the class, Nos. 6225–6229 (named after Duchesses) were also built in streamlined form {{at an average}} cost of £11,323 each. They were painted in the same shade of crimson lake which had already been applied to the Princess Royal class; the same style of horizontal lining {{that had been a}} feature of the first five locomotives was continued, but in gilt. Although the crimson lake matched the standard LMS rolling stock, there was no attempt to apply the gilt lining along the sides of these coaches. A prototype trainset was built with such lining for exhibition in America, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> put into service due to the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Grant's {{casualties}} in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> issued. In response to rumors of one, however, {{the editors of the}} New York World and the Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.|$|E

5|$|Nasser died {{unexpectedly}} in November 1970, with Gaddafi {{playing a}} prominent role at his funeral. Nasser was succeeded by Anwar Sadat, who suggested that rather than creating a unified state, the Arab states should create a political federation, implemented in April 1971; in doing so, Egypt, Syria and Sudan received large grants of Libyan oil money. In February 1972, Gaddafi and Sadat signed an unofficial charter of merger, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> implemented because relations broke down the following year. Sadat became increasingly wary of Libya's radical direction, and the September 1973 deadline for implementing the Federation passed by with no action taken.|$|E
5|$|On 26 June {{the agents}} {{returned}} {{to supervise the}} destruction of the promotional material, including 251 copies of Reich's books. The American Civil Liberties Union issued a press release criticizing the book burning, although coverage of the release was poor, and Reich ended up asking them not to help because he was annoyed that they had failed to criticize {{the destruction of the}} accumulators. In England A.S. Neill and the poet Herbert Read signed a letter of protest, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> published. On 23 July the remaining accumulators in New York were destroyed by S. A. Collins and Sons, who had built them.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} volumes of The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley were {{published}} in 1858, but were poorly received by critics. The book was not as well edited as his previous article and many felt {{that it did not}} contain the insights about Shelley and his works that Shelley at Oxford did. The reception was not universally negative however, and several of Shelley's friends enjoyed the book. The Shelley family was very upset at the way Shelley was portrayed; they demanded the return of Shelley's papers and obtained an injunction preventing the publication of any further volumes. Hogg had begun writing a third, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> completed.|$|E
