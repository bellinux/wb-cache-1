For gold thread this is typically yellow, or in older examples orange; for silver, white or gray.

When multiple threads must be laid next to each other, a technique called <b>bricking</b> is used: {{the position of the}} couching stitches is offset between rows, producing an appearance similar to a brick wall.

The highly insulated external walls are essential prerequisites for low energy consumption of buildings. Filling shell of the <b>brick</b> with insulation material {{is one of the}} methods to reduce cooling loads in buildings. This paper aims to investigate the dynamic thermal parameters of various insulation filled <b>bricks.</b> The dynamic thermal parameters highlighted in the study include thermal transmittance, admittance, decrement factor, time lag and areal thermal heat capacity. The cyclic admittance method was employed in computer simulation program to compute dynamic thermal parameters of stuffed <b>bricks.</b> The four <b>brick</b> materials such as mud <b>bricks,</b> burnt <b>bricks,</b> concrete blocks and fly ash <b>bricks</b> were selected. The insulation materials used for filling shells of the <b>brick</b> are foam glass and asbestos fibre. The total forty eight stuffed <b>bricks</b> were investigated. The shell of the <b>brick</b> is filled by the insulation and the each layer of insulation is separated by a <b>brick</b> web.

I remember, in the neighbourhood of Dresden, discovering a picturesque and narrow valley leading down towards the Elbe. The winding roadway ran beside a mountain torrent, which for {{a mile or so}} fretted and foamed over rocks and boulders between wood-covered banks. I followed it enchanted until, turning a corner, I suddenly came across a gang of eighty or a hundred workmen. They were busy tidying up that valley, and making that stream respectable. All the stones that were impeding the course of the water they were carefully picking out and carting away. The bank on either side they were <b>bricking</b> up and cementing. The overhanging trees and bushes, the tangled vines and creepers they were rooting up and trimming down. A little further I came upon the finished work--the mountain valley as it ought to be, according to German ideas. The water, now a broad, sluggish stream, flowed over a level, gravelly bed, between two walls crowned with stone coping. At every hundred yards it gently descended down three shallow wooden platforms. For a space on either side the ground had been cleared, and at regular intervals young poplars planted. Each sapling was protected by a shield of wickerwork and bossed by an iron rod. In the course of a couple of years it is the hope of the local council to have [...] "finished" [...] that valley throughout its entire length, and made it fit for a tidy-minded lover of German nature to walk in.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the thermal performance and economic assessment of different types of clay and concrete masonry <b>brick</b> wall samples used in building construction. In this study, eighteen types of clay <b>bricks</b> and two types of concrete <b>bricks</b> were analyzed for thermal performance.

The analysis of the results shows that the equivalent thermal conductivity does not depend only on the <b>brick</b> material and configuration but also on the <b>brick</b> thickness. The <b>bricks</b> having same configuration and size, the equivalent thermal conductivity variation is large depending on the type of material used, especially for concrete <b>brick.</b> In general, the <b>brick</b> with lesser thickness has lower conductivity as compared to those having higher thickness. However, the effect of <b>brick</b> length on equivalent thermal conductivity is insignificant. The economic analysis showed that the insulated clay <b>brick</b> type 16 is the most economical <b>brick</b> among the types of <b>brick</b> studied. Moreover, it is worthwhile to note that the net present value of normal concrete <b>brick</b> (type 19) is reduced by about 45 % by making the concrete <b>brick</b> lightweight (type 20) ...|$|R
