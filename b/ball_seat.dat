50|$|A ceramic valve is a valve with ceramic trim, <b>ball,</b> <b>seat,</b> disc or lining. A carbon or {{stainless}} steel body is used to protect the ceramic trim from being damaged by sudden thermal or mechanical shock. Advanced ceramics {{are used in the}} manufacture including alumina, zirconia and silicon nitride. Significant benefits of the use of ceramic in valves (when compared to steel or other traditional materials) include resistance to wear and their lower mass. Thanks to the excellent corrosion resistance, abrasive resistance and wear resistance, ceramic valves are often used in severe corrosive and abrasive applications, such as FGD, and pneumatic refuse conveying systems.|$|E
40|$|Early {{failures}} {{occurred with}} two sizes of wheel bolts used for attaching front wheels and dual rear wheels to heavy truck hubs. Failure resulted in fracture of the bolts, {{and was a}} response to the material and process specification which produced a steel microstructure highly susceptible to hydrogen-assisted stress cracking. The microstructure resulted from an alloy steel that was carburized, heat treated, and then zinc plated. This combination of material and processing produced a high-strength SAE Grade 8 bolt (equivalent to an ISO 10. 9 grade) with a hard, brittle case and an anodic zinc coating. A slight misalignment of the wheel bolt coupled with a <b>ball</b> <b>seat</b> mounting design for the wheel nuts created a combined axial and bending stress that exceeded the threshold for hydrogen-assisted stress cracking...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn liner cementing, {{the upper}} cement plug and inner {{components}} of a common hanger needs to be drilled out after cementing, which {{will result in a}} poor cementing quality or even gas leakage at the flare opening. Therefore, a new packer-type drilling-free liner hanger has been developed, and a hydraulic setting-control packer, a flexible drilling-free seal box, and an auxiliary bearing back-off mechanism that go with the line hanger have been designed at the same time. Specific operation procedures include: (1) run in the liner string to the designed depth, then fully circulate the drilling fluid, finally drop the ball. When the tripping ball gets into the seat, the pressure will go up to cut off the hanging control pin and set the hanger; (2) continue to hold the pressure and cut off the <b>ball</b> <b>seat</b> pin to form circulation; (3) trip in the drill pipe to exert pressure on the hanger, back off to release the hanger from the running tool; (4) lower the drill pipe plug upon the completion of cement injection, cut off the releasing control pin of hollow casing plug, and run down further to bump with the bumping assembly; (5) remove the cementing head and connect the kelly driver, hold pressure again, then slowly pull up the drill tools, exert hydraulic pressure on the setting hydraulic cylinder of the packer assembly to cut off the setting control pin and set the packer; and (6) pull up the tools to the flare opening and wash out excessive cement slurry by circulating to realize free drilling of the whole hole. The successful application of the liner hanger in 127  mm diameter liner in Well BQ 203 -H 1 indicates that the packer-type liner hanger has such advantages as easy hanging and back-off, accurate bumping, simple setting, and sound sealing performance...|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{ball valves}} {{are based on}} {{elastomeric}} sealing technologies which exhibit restricted wear resistance {{in the presence of}} network impurities while requiring high operating torques. In the described investigations, the elastomeric sealing of a 2 -inch floating ball valve was replaced by a metal-to-metal seating for attaining specific application requirements, without major dimensional changes. In order to avoid the use of elastomerics and achieve a high performance rating of the valve (Class VI shut-off), computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were employed to predict the optimum contact geometry of ball/seating. A high accuracy contact was obtained through precision turning of the hardened metal shell (<b>ball</b> <b>seating)</b> and by grinding of its counter ball body. Both components, <b>ball</b> and <b>seating,</b> were appropriately heat treated and subsequently coated with a nanostructured diamond like carbon (DLC) coating, applied by physical vapour deposition (PVD) techniques, providing superior surface strength characteristics and nearly frictionless operation.

50|$|The {{original}} firearms {{were loaded}} from the muzzle by forcing a ball from the muzzle to the chamber. Whether using a rifled or smooth bore, {{a good fit}} was needed to seal the bore and provide the best possible accuracy from the gun. To ease the force required to load the projectile, these early guns used an undersized ball, and a patch made of cloth, paper, or leather to fill the windage (the gap between the ball and {{the walls of the}} bore). The patch provided some degree of sealing, kept the <b>ball</b> <b>seated</b> on the charge of black powder, and kept the ball concentric to the bore. In rifled barrels, the patch also provided a means to transfer the spin from the rifling to the bullet, as the patch is engraved rather than the ball. Until the advent of the hollow-base Minié ball, which obturates upon firing to seal the bore and engage the rifling, the patch provided the best means of getting the projectile to engage the rifling.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe present {{experiments}} {{aimed to}} characterize the visual performance of subjects with long-standing, unilateral cortical blindness when walking in a naturalistic, virtual environment. Under static, seated testing conditions, cortically blind subjects are known to exhibit compensatory eye movement strategies. However, they still complain of significant impairment in visual detection during navigation. To assess whether {{this is due to}} a change in compensatory eye movement strategy between sitting and walking, we measured eye and head movements in subjects asked to detect peripherally-presented, moving basketballs. When seated, cortically blind subjects detected ∼ 80 % of balls, while controls detected almost all <b>balls.</b> <b>Seated</b> blind subjects did not make larger head movements than controls, but they consistently biased their fixation distribution towards their blind hemifield. When walking, head movements were similar in the two groups, but the fixation bias decreased to the point that fixation distribution in cortically blind subjects became similar to that in controls – with one major exception: at the time of basketball appearance, walking controls looked primarily at the far ground, in upper quadrants of the virtual field of view; cortically blind subjects looked significantly more at the near ground, in lower quadrants of the virtual field. Cortically blind subjects detected only 58 % of the balls when walking while controls detected ∼ 90 %. Thus, the adaptive gaze strategies adopted by cortically blind individuals as a compensation for their visual loss are strongest and most effective when seated and stationary. Walking significantly alters these gaze strategies in a way that seems to favor walking performance, but impairs peripheral target detection. It is possible that this impairment underlies the experienced difficulty of those with cortical blindness when navigating in real life...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{golf club}} head speed (CHS) {{has been shown}} to result in greater driving {{distances}} and is also correlated with golf handicap. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationships between field-based measures of strength and power and golf CHS with a secondary aim to determine the reliability of the selected tests. A correlation design was used to assess the following variables: anthropometrics, squat jump (SJ) height and squat jump peak power (SJPP), unilateral countermovement jump (CMJ) heights (right leg countermovement jump and left leg countermovement jump [LLCMJ]), bilateral CMJ heights, countermovement jump peak power (CMJPP), and medicine <b>ball</b> <b>seated</b> throw (MBST) and medicine ball rotational throw (MBRT). Fouty-eight male subjects participated in the study (age: 20. 1 +/- 3. 2 years, height: 1. 76 +/- 0. 07 m, mass: 72. 8 +/- 7. 8 kg, handicap: 5. 8 +/- 2. 2). Moderate significant correlations were reported between CHS and MBRT (r = 0. 67; p < 0. 01), MBST (r = 0. 63; p < 0. 01), CMJPP (r = 0. 54; p < 0. 01), and SJPP (r = 0. 53; p < 0. 01). Weak significant correlations (r = 0. 3 - 0. 5) were identified between CHS and the other remaining variables excluding LLCMJ. Stepwise multiple regression analysis identified that the MBST and SJ were the greatest predictors of CHS, explaining 49 % of the variance. Additionally the intraclass correlation coefficients reported for tests of CHS and all performance variables were deemed acceptable (r = 0. 7 - 0. 9). The results of this study suggest that the strength and conditioning coach can accurately assess and monitor the physical abilities of golf athletes using the proposed battery of field tests. Additionally, movements that are more concentrically dominant in nature may display stronger relationships with CHS due to MBST and SJ displaying the highest explained variance after a stepwise linear regression...|$|R
