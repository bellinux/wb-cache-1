40|$|Pyridine and {{pyridine}} based {{products are}} of major concern as environmental pollutants {{due to their}} recalcitrant, persistent, toxic and teratogenic nature. In this study, we describe biodegradation of pyridine by an isolated consortium/strain under aerobic condition. Batch experiment results reveal that at lower initial pyridine concentrations (1 - 20 mg l(- 1)), almost complete degradation was observed whereas at higher concentration (30 - 50 mg l(- 1)), the degradation efficiency was dropped significantly. This {{may be due to}} inhibitory effect of pyridine at higher concentrations. The value of decay and yield coefficient was also determined. Furthermore, the <b>bio-augmentation</b> of isolated consortium/strain into the activated sludge consortium in different quantity has been also done and the effect of <b>bio-augmentation</b> on degradation has been studied. The results reveal that as the quantity of <b>bio-augmentation</b> increases, the degradation of pyridine increases. At 25 % <b>bio-augmentation,</b> complete degradation of 20 mg l(- 1) of pyridine can be achieved within 96 h of incubation.

The positive impact of fungal addition was confirmed when fungi was beforehand accelerated by pre-culture on whey (5 g/L lactose) or on the dairy effluent. Indeed, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal yields increased from 55 % to 75 % for model medium, diluted milk. While after inoculation of an industrial biological tank from a dairy factory with the fungal consortium accelerated by pre-cultivation in a 1000 L pilot plant, the outlet COD values decreased from values above the standard one (100 mg/L) to values in the range of 50 - 70 mg/L.

Three treatment reactors (X, Y and Z) and one control reactor (A) were charged with 1500 Â g of oily sludge and 250 Â g of agricultural soil (i. e. an oily sludge to soil ratio of 6 : 1), the mixture homogenized and allowed to settle for seven days before various CFUs were added to reactors X, Y and Z. Reactor A did not receive any bio-preparation. The agricultural soil served both as a nutrient and a microbe carrier. With regularly scheduled mixing and watering, the THC reduction in the oily sludge varied between 40. 7 % and 53. 2 % within two weeks as well as between 63. 7 % and 84. 5 % within six weeks of applying the bio-remediation.

40|$|Expansive soils, {{also known}} as swell-shrink soils have {{been a problem for}} civil {{infrastructures}} including roads and foundations from ancient times. The use of chemical additives such as cement and lime to stabilize expansive soils is a common practice among geotechnical engineers especially for lightly loaded structures. However, several occurrences of subgrade failures were observed after stabilizing with chemical additives hence engineers are in search of sustainable stabilization alternatives. Microbial Induced Calcite Precipitation (MICP) is gaining attention as an environmental friendly soil improvement technique. Several researchers have successfully tested its feasibility in mitigating liquefaction induced problems in sandy soils. This research focuses on evaluating its effectiveness in stabilizing expansive soils. For this purpose, three natural expansive soils with high and low plasticity properties were subjected to MICP treatments. Two methods of MICP treatments were followed in this research. The first method was <b>bio-augmentation.</b> In this method the soil samples were first augmented with bacterium Sporosarcina pasteurii and then treated with calcium chloride and urea (substrates) and cured for seven days. In the second method <b>bio-augmentation</b> was followed by stimulation using a nutrient delivery system which was developed to treat microbes with substrates. Variables such as soil types, microbial concentrations and number of pore volumes of substrate injected were studied in this research. Geotechnical testing including Atterberg limits, unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and one-Dimensional (1 -D) swell test along with specific surface area were performed to evaluate the efficacy of MICP treatments. The results indicated that MICP treatments could be a viable alternative for expansive soils treatments. Although the improvement in UCS values after both types of MICP treatments were notable, the strength gain was considerably lower than lime treated soils. However, 1 -D strain reduction was on par with lime stabilized soils. It was also observed that MICP treatments do not result in significant clay mineralogy changes...|$|E

In contrast, the degradation rate of the mixture and consortium (VF) is faster than that of consortium (VF) from the 1 st to 8 th day. After 8 th day, the degradation rate of the mixture and the consortium (VF) was same with that of consortium (VF), indicating that partial large molecules could be degraded into small molecules by the mixture, such as cellulose and lignin, etc. The addition of the mixture in the consortium (VF) can improve the degradation effect on pollutants.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Crude oil, refined {{petroleum}} products, {{as well as}} polycyclic {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} are ubiquitous in various environmental compartments. They can bioaccumulate in food chains where they disrupt biochemical or physiological activities of many organisms, thus causing carcinogenesis of some organs, mutagenesis in the genetic material, impairment in reproductive capacity and / or causing hemorrhage in exposed population. The cause / effect of oil pollutant are usually quantified by using biological end point parameters referred to as biomarkers. Contamination of soil arising from spills {{is one of the}} most limiting factors to soil fertility and hence crop productivity. These deleterious effects make it mandatory to have a counter measure for the petroleum hydrocarbon pollutant in the environment.

This study reviews the challenges to managing oil spills in terrestrial and marine environments to identify areas that require further research. Current challenges associated with bioremediation of spilled petroleum include resistance of asphalthenes to biodegradation; delay of heavy or high molar mass polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) biodegradation, eutrophication caused by biostimulation, unsustainability of <b>bio-augmentation</b> in the field, poor bioavailability of spilled petroleum, inefficiency of biodegradation in anoxic environments and failure of successful bioremediation laboratory studies in the field.

To provide guidance on what mixture combinations to use, information is needed on how the ratio of labile to recalcitrant components affects the degradation rate and the types of microbial populations supported. To investigate this, different ratios of wood and hay were used in up-flow column bioreactors treating selenium- and sulphate-containing synthetic mine-influenced water. The degradation rates of crude fibre components appeared to be similar regardless of the relative amounts of wood and hay. However, the nature of the degradation products might have differed in that those produced in the hay-rich bioreactors were more biodegradable and supported high sulphate-reduction rates. Microorganisms in the sulphate-reducing and cellulose-degrading inocula persisted in the bioreactors indicating that <b>bio-augmentation</b> was effective. There was a shift in microbial community composition over time suggesting that different microbial groups were involved in decomposition of more recalcitrant material.

By altering the nitrogen source (NH 4 Cl, putrescine and cadaverine (diamines) and butylamine (monoamine)) and concentration, we have identified a constitutive flavin dependent oxidase (EC 1. 4. 3. 10) within Rhodococcus opacus. The activity of this oxidase can be increased by over two orders of magnitude {{in the presence of}} aliphatic diamines. In addition, the expression of a copper dependent diamine oxidase (EC 1. 4. 3. 22) was observed at diamine concentrations> 1 mM or when cells were grown with butylamine, which acts to inhibit the flavin oxidase. A Michaelis-Menten kinetic treatment of the flavin oxidase delivered a Michaelis constant (KM) = 190 μM and maximum rate (kcat) = 21. 8 s(- 1) for the oxidative deamination of putrescine with a lower KM (= 60 μM) and comparable kcat (= 18. 2 s(- 1)) for the copper oxidase.

No research has directly addressed the critical question of how to prevent declines and extinctions caused by outbreaks of the disease.

Here, we demonstrate that a species of anti-Bd skin bacteria can be successfully added to skins of salamanders Plethodon cinereus, and that addition of this bacterium reduced the severity of a disease symptom in experimentally infected individuals.

40|$|Biopiling is an ex situ {{bioremediation}} {{technology that}} has been extensively used for remediating {{a wide range of}} petrochemical contaminants in soils. Biopiling involves the assembling of contaminated soils into piles and stimulating the biodegrading activity of microbial populations by creating near optimum growth conditions. Phytoremediation is another very successful bioremediation technique and involves the use of plants and their associated microbiomes to degrade, sequester or bio-accumulate pollutants from contaminated soil and water. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effectiveness of a combined phytoremediation/biopiling system, termed Ecopiling, to remediate hydrocarbon impacted industrial soil. The large scale project was carried out on a sandy loam, petroleum impacted soil (1613 mg Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) kg- 1 soil). The contaminated soil was amended with chemical fertilisers, inoculated with TPH degrading bacterial consortia and then used to construct passive biopiles. Finally, a phyto-cap of perennial rye grass (Lolium multiflorum) and white clover (Trifolium repens) was sown on the soil surface to complete the Ecopile. Monitoring of important physico-chemical parameters was carried out at regular intervals throughout the trial. Two years after construction the TPH levels in the petroleum impacted Ecopiles were below detectable limits in all but 1 subsample (152 mg TPH kg- 1 soil). The Ecopile system is a multi-factorial bioremediation process involving bio-stimulation, <b>bio-augmentation</b> and phytoremediation. One of the key advantages to this system is the reduced costs of the remediation process, as once constructed, there is little additional cost in terms of labour and maintenance (although the longer process time may incur additional monitoring costs).

As such, feed material to the processes was studied to determine whether some of the components that are not required in the distillation process could in fact be removed prior to entering the system.

40|$|Slurry {{stores are}} an {{important}} source of both methane (CH 4) and ammonia (NH 3) emissions. Strategies to reduce these emissions include modifying the slurry environment through use of natural and biological additives. In this thesis, two such strategies were explored. The first three experimental chapters explored the potential to mitigate emissions by using inorganic acid (50 % concentrated sulphuric acid H 2 SO 4), fermentable carbohydrates at 10 % w/v to reduce slurry pH, and biological additives (effective microorganisms - EM) at 5 % v/v, to suppress methanogenesis. The addition of a carbohydrate source resulted in ‘self-acidification’ of cattle slurry from average pH 6. 8 to pH’s as low as pH 3. 5 in laboratory and pot-scale experiments, under both warm and cool conditions. The reduced slurry pH inhibited both CH 4 and NH 3 emissions significantly (by between 72 % and 84 % for CH 4, and 57 % and 92 % for NH 3). The use of agriculture food-chain by-products as sources of available carbohydrates, such as brewery spent grains, successfully promoted self-acidification by producing large amounts of lactic acid and reducing the slurry pH to 4. 0. As a result, the greenhouse gas (GHG) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 eq.; CH 4 +CO 2 +N 2 O) emission was inhibited by 86 %. However, NH 3 emissions were not significantly inhibited. Meanwhile, methane oxidation by methanotrophs within slurry crusts was also explored, but <b>bio-augmentation</b> with EM showed no clear effect on this potential CH 4 sink. The application of self-acidified slurry to ryegrass in a pot experiment demonstrated significant NH 3 and CH 4 inhibition compared to the untreated slurry during the first 48 hours after application. However, plant health was severely affected by the acidic slurry treatment, resulting in plant death in most cases. The mechanism for the self-acidification of slurry was elucidated by a conducting a metagenomic analysis of the slurries immediately after carbohydrate addition, {{and at the end of}} the 30 day storage period. This linked the dominance of Lactobacillales in the self-acidified slurry to the high lactic acid production and reduced pH in the treatments that received the carbohydrate source. The metagenomic analysis also identified groups of hydrogenotrophic methanogens of the Order Methanobacteriales, Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales, as the dominant methanogens in both treated and untreated slurries. The low CH 4 emission from the self-acidified slurry was associated with low abundance of methanogens. Whilst this study demonstrated the potential for self-acidification of slurry to reduce CH 4 production and emission, as well as reduction in NH 3 emissions from slurry stores and following land spreading, further research is necessary to test the strategy at a larger scale, and develop methods that minimize the negative effect of the acidified slurry on soil and plant health, e. g. via slurry injection or incorporation...|$|E
40|$|In Ethiopia {{industrial}} effluents containing high {{contents of}} organic matter, nitrogen and heavy metals are discharged into inland surface waters {{with little or}} no pre-treatment. Significant pollution concerns related to these effluents include dissolved oxygen depletion, toxicity and eutrophication of the receiving waters. This has not only forced the government to formulate regulations and standards for discharge limits but also resulted in an increasing interest and development of methods and systems by which wastewater can be recycled and used sustainably. The need for technologies for environmentally friendly treatment of industrial wastes such as tannery wastewaters is therefore obvious. Biological processes are not only cost effective but also environmentally sound alternatives to the chemical treatment of tannery wastewaters. The aim of the research presented in this thesis was to develop and optimize processes for biological nitrogen removal from tannery wastewaters and to identify the most efficient denitrifying organisms in tannery wastewaters laden with toxic substances. A pilot plant consisting of a predenitrification anoxic system, aerated nitrification compartment and a sedimentation tank (clarifier) all arranged in series was developed and installed on the premises of Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia. In spite of high influent chromium and sulphide perturbations over the successive feeding phases, the performance of the pilot plant was encouraging. The overall removal efficiency of the pilot plant over the experimental feeding phases varied between 82 - 98 % for total nitrogen, 95 - 98 % for COD, 96 - 98 % for BOD 5, 46 - 95 % for ammonia nitrogen, 95 - 99 % for sulphide and 93 - 99 % for trivalent Chromium. Six isolates from over 1000 pure cultures were identified as the most efficient denitrifying bacteria. From both cellular fatty acid profiles and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, the six selected strains were phylogenetically identified as Brachymonas denitrificans in the β-subdivision of the Proteobacteria. All the six strains contain cd 1 -type nitrite reductase. The efficient isolates characterized in this study are of great value because of their excellent denitrifying properties and high tolerance to the concentrations of toxic compounds prevailing in tannery wastewaters. <b>Bio-augmentation</b> of the pilot plant with this bacterium showed a clear correlation between in situ denitrifying activities measured by nitrate uptake rate, population dynamics of the introduced B. denitrificans monitored by fluorescent in situ hybridization and the pilot plant performance, suggesting that the strategy of introducing this species for enhancing process performance has potential applications. Moreover, the nitrate-reducing, sulphur-oxidizing bacteria (NR-SOB) were also found in the pilot plant in abundance with steady sulphide removal efficiency during the study period. This could provide opportunities for the application of biologically mediated simultaneous removal of sulphide and nitrogen from tannery effluents. In addition to enriching high consortia of denitrifiers in the anoxic system to attain high denitrification efficiency and also improving the overall nitrification efficiency of the system, the predenitrification-nitrification pilot process plant stimulated the activity of indigenous NR-SOB to simultaneously remove sulphide from the system. Thus, the pilot plant was found to be operationally efficient for the removal of nitrogen, organic matter and other pollutants from tannery wastewaters.

These herbicides consisted of Bromacil, Tebuthiuron and Ethidimuron which are all photosynthesis inhibitors, more specifically, they disrupt the plastoquinone protein during electron transport at photosystem I 1 (PSII). In this study the effect of biostimulation and <b>bio-augmentation</b> of a specific bioremediation agent (B 350) as prescribed by ESKOM, on residual herbicides, Bromacil, Tebuthiuron and Ethidimuron was evaluated by monitoring the soil physical and chemical properties, microbial attributes, including potential microbial activity and community structure, as well as the physiological effect experienced by plants (Cynodoh dactylon and Zea mays). Results from soil physical and chemical analyses were correlated with results obtained for the functional and structural diversity of microbial communities. All results were investigated through statistical and multivariate analysis and the most prominent soil physical and chemical parameters that influence the biological and biochemical properties of the soil were identified. Results obtained from this study indicated that there were no significant difference (p < 0. 05) between the treatments, with bioremediation agent, irradiated agent and without the agent based on results obtained from soil microbial properties and plant physiology. Before the trial started the uncontaminated soil showed an active microbial function, characterised by dehydrogenase, urease and arylsulphatase activity, but community structure was not very diverse. The contaminated soil, irradiated contaminated soil and silica sand showed less enzymatic function and was characterised by phospholipid fatty acid groups, mid-branched saturated fatty acids, terminally branched saturated fatty acids, normal saturated fatty acids and monosaturated fatty acids which are indicative of microorganisms that survive better in harsh environments. Three weeks after the addition of the specific bioremediation took place, the uncontaminated soil showed an increase in P-glucosidase activity and percentage organic carbon (%C), which could be a result of the presence of available plant material. Furthermore, an increase in major PLFA groups were seen, suggesting that an increase in diversity within the soil community occurred. The contaminated soil, irradiated contaminated soil and silica sand once again was characterised by a low microbial function and diversity, showing no improvement. Fluorescence data clearly show a decline in PS 11 function that result in the decline of the rate of photosynthesis, which was seen from COz gas exchange rates. Furthermore, the decrease in photosynthetic activity after three weeks was too severe to supply additional information about the mechanism within photosynthesis or the photoprotective mechanisms. A detailed study was conducted in which a 3 : 1 dilution of contaminated soil with silica sand, was also monitored for changes within plant physiology. Results revealed that inhibition of PS I 1 function already takes place within a few days time and the decline in photosynthesis is as a result of electron transport that does not supply adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and P-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADPH) to the Calvin cycle (or Reductive Pentose Phosphate pathway). It does not appear that rubulose- 1,sbisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) is affected within the Calvin cycle. As a result of PS I 1 function failure, reaction centres are damaged by the production of harmful singlet oxygen and photoprotective mechanisms (xanthophyll cycle) can not be activated. Thus, except for dealing with ineffective electron transport, additional damage is caused to physiological functions. After six weeks a decrease in the estimated viable biomass for all growth mediums was found. Results of the of trans- to cis- monoenoic fatty acids and cyclopropyl fatty acids to their monoenoic precursors ratios indicated that the soil microbial community for the contaminated growth mediums, all experienced nutritional stress throughout this trail. The specific bioremediation agent (B 350) used, seemed to have no effect on the microbial function and community structure within soil and as agent had no effect on the residual herbicides or the plant physiology which experienced an extreme decline in major metabolic functions.
