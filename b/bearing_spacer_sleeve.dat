50|$|Longboard {{bearings}} are {{all about}} reducing unnecessary friction to allow flawless stunt. Bearings connect the wheel to turn smoothly. Bearings can be made of many materials, including steel (which is most prevalent), titanium, or ceramics. Ceramic bearings are the most expensive. Bearings are usually rated in the ABEC scale. The ratings run from 1-9, using only odd numbers. The higher the rating, the more precise tolerances the bearing has been machined to. However, ABEC rating is not compulsory and not all bearings use ABEC ratings. Some companies will use other methods to describe the bearings' resistance and durability. Optionally, longboarders add <b>bearing</b> <b>spacers</b> between the <b>bearings</b> in the wheels. This allows for the axle nut to be tightened {{all the way down}} eliminating the high frequency wobbles and increasing the lifetime of the bearings.|$|R

Whereas lysine, cysteine and N-terminal amino acids have been mostly used for peptide conjugation, we describe a new, widely applicable approach to peptide conjugation based on the nonclassical bioisosteric replacement of the guanidine group in arginine by a functionalized carbamoylguanidine moiety. Four argininecontaining peptide receptor ligands (angiotensin II, neurotensin(8 - 13), an analog of the C-terminal pentapeptide of neuropeptide Y, and a neuropeptide FF analog) were subject of this proof-of-concept study.

In order to investigate these effects, this study integrates {{the outcome of}} a 3 D dynamic model, developed for assessment of the defect pattern and experimental results from a full scale CH- 53 Swashplate test rig. The ability to withstand high radial and bi-directional axial loads makes duplex bearings common in aircraft applications and specifically in helicopter rotors. The swashplate of the CH- 53 is constructed of duplex angular contact ball <b>bearings.</b> Two <b>spacers,</b> internal between the static inner rings and external, between the rotating outer rings support the bearing rings. A structural defect is formed by a faulty external spacer, thus causing a lack of support to the top bearing and deformation of the outer rings.

A crystal structure of the 2 : 1 adduct shows one 9 -MA in the molecular cleft defined by the two terpy-Pd-L units and the other resides on an outside face of one terpy-Pd-L unit. To establish the site residency time of the guests, a number of tethered molecules were prepared. These involve an anthracene molecule tethered to a pyridine ligand bound to the palladium atoms to form intramolecular host–guest adducts. Rotating-frame Overhauser effects were used to infer the site residency of the anthracene guests in the receptor.

In buffer solution, carbamate and ester prodrugs were found to be chemically stable. Most prodrugs containing a dipeptidyl linker efficiently converted into the BCNA parent drug. In contrast, the Val-Pro alkyldiamino prodrugs converted predominantly into their alkyldiamino prodrug intermediates in the presence of CD 26 and human serum. A marked increase in water solubility was observed for all prodrugs. In contrast to the parent compound, a tetrapeptide prodrug containing the Val-Val dipeptide as a self-cleavage spacer released substantial amounts of the BCNA parent drug at the basolateral side of Caco- 2 cell cultures and exhibited 15 - to 20 -fold increased bioavailability in mice relative to the poorly bioavailable parent compound.

40|$|A {{series of}} mono- and bifunctional compds. 2 - 7, {{based on the}} ureido pyrimidinone quadruple {{hydrogen}} bonding unit, was prepd. to study the mode of aggregation of these compds. in the bulk and in soln. Compds. 2 - 7 exhibit thermotropic liq. cryst. properties, as evidenced by differential scanning calorimetry and optical polarization microscopy. The presence of an ordered hexagonal discotic (Dho) phase of 2 a was confirmed by X-ray diffraction on an aligned sample. In chloroform, the bifunctional compds. form cyclic dimers at millimolar concns., and these dimers exist in equil. with linear species above a crit. concn., which may be from 6 mM to greater than 260 mM, depending {{on the structure of}} the spacer. CD measurements in chloroform did not show a Cotton effect. Dodecane solns. of compds. 3, 4 b, and 7 b display a Cotton effect at the absorption band of the phenyl-pyrimidinone unit. Amplification of chirality was obsd. in mixts. of 7 a and 7 b, but not in mixts. of 4 a and 4 b, indicating that 7 a and 7 b form mixed polymeric aggregates with a helical architecture in dodecane soln., whereas 4 a and 4 b do not. The Cotton effect is lost upon increasing the temp. Half of the helicity is lost at 25 °C for 3 and at 60 °C for 4 b, suggesting that 3, <b>bearing</b> the shorters <b>spacer,</b> forms less stable columns than 4 b. Compd. 7 b losses half of its helicity at 45 °C. Compds. 2 b, 5, and 6 do not exhibit helical organization, as evidenced by the absence of Cotton effect...|$|R
40|$|Low {{molecular}} weight proteins (LMWPs) {{are known to}} be reabsorbed and catabolized primarily by the proximal tubular cells of the kidneys. As such, LMWPs might serve as drug carriers that release drugs site-specifically in the kidney. We tested this concept in vitro by coupling different drugs to the LMWP lysozyme both directly (amide bond) and via different spacers: oligopeptides (amide bond), (poly-) alpha-hydroxy acids (ester bond), and a pH sensitive cis-aconityl spacer (amide bond). The capability of the kidney to release the parent drug from such drug-spacer derivatives and drug-LMWP conjugates by enzymatic or chemical hydrolysis of the bond was tested by incubation experiments in renal cortex homogenates and lysosomal lysates. Directly coupled conjugates of terminal carboxyl group containing drugs and lysozyme were catabolized to single amino acids, but did not result in release of the parent drug. The amide bond between the drug and the final amino acid (lysine) appeared to be stable in the incubation milieu. Different oligopeptide spacers coupled to the drugs showed similar results: the oligopeptide itself was cleaved but the amide bond between the drug and different single amino acids remained untouched. Only amide bonds of derivatives of carboxylic drugs with peptide structures themselves were cleaved. Some of the directly coupled conjugates of terminal amino drugs and oligopeptides showed clear release of the parent drug whereas others were stable. Terminal amino drugs were rapidly released from an acid-sensitive cis-aconityl spacer. Terminal carboxyl group containing drugs were enzymatically released from their glycolic and lactic ester spacers at different rates. These kinds of drugs were also released as parent drug from LMWP conjugates with ester spacers like L-lactic acid. Increasing spacer length by intercalating a tetra(L-lactic acid) molecule between the drug and the protein further increased the extent and rate of drug release, indicating increased accessability of the bond to the enzymes. Terminal amino group containing drugs were rapidly generated as parent drug from LMWP conjugates using an acid-sensitive spacer. In addition the conjugates were found to be adequately stable in plasma, considering their rapid clearance from the bloodstream. It is concluded that LMWPs may indeed be of use as carriers for specific renal delivery of drugs, since renal cortex homogenates and lysosomal lysates are able to catabolize the protein and generate the parent drug from drug-LMWP conjugates <b>bearing</b> suitable <b>spacers.</b> The option of enzymatic release is limited by the narrow specificity of the lysosomal enzymes. This has profound implications for the synthesis of suitable conjugates, since the nature of the drug itself, the type of bond, and also spacer length largely determine whether release of the parent drug will occur. Tailor-made spacers containing the correct mode of attachment and the right spacer length are required for this option. Chemical hydrolysis, using acid-sensitive linkers, is suggested as a viable alternative approach...|$|R
40|$|Five {{push-pull}} heterocyclic dyes 4 - 7, and 9 were synthesized and characterized {{in order}} to study the variations in the optical, electronic and photovoltaic properties induced by structural modifications, i. e. different spacer units and anchoring groups. The final push-pull conjugated dyes 6 - 7 and 9 are formed by a N,N-dimethylaniline donor moiety conjugated with bithiophene, ethynyl-bithiophene or ethynyl-thieno[3, 2 -b]thiophene spacers and cyanoacetic acid or rhodanine- 3 -acetic acid as anchoring group. The synthesis of the precursor aldehydes 4 - 5 was accomplished through a Sonogashira coupling, on the other hand, compound 8 was prepared by Suzuki coupling. Knoevenagel condensation of aldehydes 4, 5 and 8 with cyanoacetic acid or rhodamine- 3 -acetic acid afforded the final push-pull dyes 6, 7 and 9. Information on conformation, electronic structure and electron distribution was obtained by DFT and TDDFTcalculations. This multidisciplinary study regarding {{the evaluation of the}} optical, redox and photovoltaic properties of the dyes reveals that compound 7, <b>bearing</b> an ethynyl-bithiophene <b>spacer</b> conjugated with a cyanoacetic acid anchoring group, has the highest conversion efficiency (3. 51 %) as dye sensitizer in nanocrystalline TiO 2 solar cells. Co-adsorption studies were also performed for dyes 6 - 7 with N 719 as co-adsorbent, and this enhanced dye efficiencies by 33 - 45 %. The best cell performance was obtained by co-adsorbing N 719 and dye 7 (75 / 25 vol%) with 4. 66 % efficiency.

40|$|In {{the present}} study the {{interaction}} between dendritic polymers, modified at their surface with guanidinium groups, with liposomes consisting of PC:Chol:DHP andthe DHP bearing the phosphate group at its polar head, was investigated. The interaction process involves molecular recognition of the complementary guanidinium and phosphate groups through combined electrostatic interaction and hydrogen-bonding formation. Dendrimers of two different generations were functionalized with guanidinium groups. The degree of functionalization, {{the distance between the}} dendrimeric surface and the guanidinium group and the balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface groups was modified with the objective to investigate the effect of these characteristics on molecular recognition. Taking into account that most membrane transporters exhibit cell-penetrating ability due to the presence of L-arginine and especially to the guanidinium group, the ability of guanidinylated dendritic polymers to translocate across model liposomal membranes was also investigated. The results were further established with in vitro experiments by monitoring the cellular uptake of the guanidinylated dendritic polymers employing A 549 cells. For this purpose the dendritic polymers’ surface groups were partially guanidinylated while the remaining surface groups were interacted either with acetic anhydride or propylene oxide. Furthermore, dendrimeric derivatives <b>bearing</b> a small <b>spacer</b> between surface groups and guanidinium groups were prepared, as well as a derivative functionalized with L-arginine. Introduction of the guanidinium group was also performed on two generations of dendritic poly-lysines. The interaction revealed that when low guanidinium/phosphate molar ratios or when dendrimeric derivatives with low degree of functionalization were employed, no size increase of the initially prepared small unilamellar liposomes was found. However, at high guanidinium/phosphate molar ratios or when highly guanidinylated dendrimeric derivatives were employed, aggregation occurred. Between different generation dendrimeric derivatives bearing the same degree of functionalization, the higher generation derivative led to increased aggregation. Furthermore, the organization of the lipid bilayer affected the interaction, since at the liquid crystalline phase aggregation was enhanced. The examination {{of the nature of the}} aggregates has shown that they primarily consist of large supramolecular structures, which are formed through fusion of the interacting small unilamellar liposomes towards multi-compartment structures. Fusion takes place under a non-leakage process involving lipid mixing and subsequent mixing of the liposomal aqueous core. However, fusion is enhanced when the bilayer is in the liquid-crystalline phase or at high guanidinium/phosphate molar ratios or when highly functionalized dendrimeric derivatives were employed. Using fluorescence quenching experiments employing FITC-labeled dendrimeric derivatives, their ability to translocate across the liposomal bilayer was investigated at low guanidinium/phosphate molar ratios. Their translocation ability is dependant on the dendrimer generation, the degree of surface functionalization and the organization of the lipid bilayer. Highly guanidinylated derivatives were unable to penetrate the liposomal bilayer. For different generation derivatives bearing the same degree of functionalization, only the low generation proved efficient penetrant. From these results it becomes evident that an appropriate balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface groups is required in order to achieve effective translocation across the liposomal bilayer. Finally, the results obtained by employing liposomes as model membranes were further established by in vitro experiments, where the ability of the dendrimeric derivatives to translocate across the cell membrane was established. The dendrimeric derivatives were localized at the cytosol, the nuclear membrane and the nucleus. The experimental results suggest a translocation mechanism which is based on the neutralization of the charged guanidinium groups by the complementary phosphate groups and the subsequent formation of a non polar complex which, along with the presence of hydrophobic groups on the dendrimeric surface, is able to translocate across the lipid bilayer...|$|R
