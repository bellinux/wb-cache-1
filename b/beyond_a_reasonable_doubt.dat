5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual remedy for {{a violation of}} one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial of counsel), constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless <b>beyond</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt.</b> With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions are the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E

40|$|The Scientific Method is {{the series}} of {{processes}} by which hypotheses, ideas and theories are shown to be true <b>beyond</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> scientific <b>doubt.</b> Most science ‘fact’ is {{expressed in terms of}} probabilities rather than certainties. Thus, by means of statistical calculations, researchers aim to determine whether an observed association between two events or characteristics may have occurred by chance (coincidence), whether they frequently occur together (correlation) or whether they occur together because one causes the other (causative relationship). In this article we review the Scientific Method and consider the statistical tests that are applied. We then focus on the occasions when science changes its mind and review eight such occurrences...|$|R

This {{is in contrast to}} the normal onus to show admissibility <b>beyond</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt.</b> The statute, in other words, has lowered the onus. This onus is of doubtful constitutionality. In S v Kotzè, {{the facts of the case}} did not make it necessary to consider this issue, but the court said obiter that the onus ought to be beyond <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt,</b> and also stressed need for compliance with section 252A(6). The accused must be given an indication of basis of challenge. See also S v Naidoo, where the court held that the onus is beyond reasonable doubt.Note that there is a duty on the accused to set out the grounds of objection.The method of determining admissibility is, generally, by way of a trial within a trial.Some cases dealing with section 252A include* S v Hammond;* S v Mkhonto; ...|$|R

25|$|United States v. Booker, , is a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} concerning criminal sentencing. The Court {{ruled that}} the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial requires that, other than a prior conviction, only facts admitted by a defendant or proved <b>beyond</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> to a jury {{may be used to}} calculate a sentence exceeding the prescribed statutory maximum sentence, whether the defendant has pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial. The maximum sentence a judge may impose is a sentence based upon the facts admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury <b>beyond</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt.</b>|$|E

500|$|Erroneous {{denial of}} <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> {{instruction}} is <b>a</b> structural error that entitles the defendant to automatic reversal. Erroneous definitions of <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> {{do not require}} reversal as long as [...] "taken as a whole, the instructions correctly conveyed the concept of <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> to the jury." [...] Instructions on certain evidentiary presumptions against the defendant, if interpreted as conclusive presumptions or as shifting {{the burden of proof}} to the defendant, are also unconstitutional; permissive presumptions are constitutional. In some circumstances, a trial court must separately instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence, in addition to giving <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> instruction.|$|R

The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution requires enough evidence to justify a rational trier of fact to find guilt <b>beyond</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt.</b> If the judge rules that such burden has been met, then {{it is up to}} the jury itself to decide if they are, in fact, convinced of guilty <b>beyond</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt.</b> If the judge finds there is not enough evidence under the standard, the case must be dismissed (or a subsequent guilty verdict must be vacated and the charges dismissed).|$|E

25|$|If the trier of {{fact has}} no doubt as to the defendant's guilt, or if their only doubts are {{unreasonable}} doubts, then the prosecutor has proved the defendant's guilt <b>beyond</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> and the defendant should be pronounced guilty.|$|E

50|$|The court held, having {{regard to}} the {{importance}} of dealing effectively with conduct that hampers the administration of justice, that the incursion into the right to silence was justifiable.

500|$|The <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> {{standard}} is primarily effectuated by jury instructions, but it retains its relevance when {{the trial judge}} considers a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal and when an appellate court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence.

25|$|The Supreme Court reversed, holding {{there is}} no principled {{distinction}} between criminal fines and imprisonment {{for the purpose of}} Apprendi because Apprendi requires that any fact other than a prior conviction that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum must be submitted to the jury and determined <b>beyond</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt.</b> The rule preserves the historic fact-finding function of the jury.
