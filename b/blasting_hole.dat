The crystallization quantity {{was measured by}} water dissolution method after emulsion explosive was pressed, {{and the relationship of}} crystallization quantity of emulsion explosive and desensitization degree was analyzed. Experimental results show that the crystallization quantity increases with dynamic pressure rising, and the desensitization degree increases, too. The crystallization quantity is relation to the type of sensitizing agent, the crystallization quantity of emulsion explosive sensitized by GMB is less than that of expanded perlite. 1 Introduction When emulsion explosive is applied to millisecond blasting job, if the hole pattern parameters design is not reasonable, the stress wave produced by initial <b>blasting</b> <b>hole</b> charge will act on the subsequent <b>blasting</b> <b>hole</b> charge, which makes the subsequent hole charge happen “dead pressed” effect or detonate incompletely, especially, when the hole distance is small, underwater blasting or water spraying working face in mine, the phenomenon is more obviously [1, 2].

Based on the JHC {{model of}} {{concrete}} damage evolution, the dynamic stress characteristics and failure mechanism of blast-hole near-field about different air-decked charge structures are studied by numerical simulation. Result {{shows that the}} failure mechanism of typical elements changes from compression-shear failure into shear-tensile failure gradually {{with the increase of}} their position in indirect initiation of both top-air-decked and bottom-air-decked charges, because of the affecting factors of the freedom and the loading from the hole. If middle-air-decked charges detonate from the top and bottom at the same time, loading and unloading waves in <b>blasting</b> <b>hole</b> are more influential to the damage of bottom elements than the surface freedom, because detonation waves of both top and bottom meet at the middle hole, so it is conducive to the media failure at the bottom hole, the elements of freedom surface have the same failure properties to top-air-decked charge...|$|E

40|$|At mining {{industry}} usually use blasting method to breaking hard and compact rock. Blasting operation using {{two types of}} stemming material such drill cutting and crushed rock or composite of both. Stemming is column {{at the top of}} blast hole that filled by its. Length of stemming column and types of stemming materials can influence the result of blasting fragmentation. Longer stemming will produce a boulder while shorter stemming will produce fly rock and the fragment size is too small. Stemming material too soft can cause the blast energy distribution not separated well so the blasting operation achievement is not optimum. This research observed and evaluated the blasting fragment size, boulder, and blasting recovery that occur from mining blasting activity used two types stemming material such drill cutting and crushed stone. The result indicated use of drill cutting material is not strong enough to withstand the blast energy towards to the top of <b>blasting</b> <b>hole</b> then produce fly rock and 26. 6 % boulder.

40|$|Using {{blasting}} caps with electronic delay units, {{it has become}} possible to employ wave superposition in rock blasting. This paper presents computer simulations to investigate the hypothesis that fragmentation is improved in areas between <b>blast</b> <b>holes</b> where the tensile waves meet, overlap and interact. In this study, a numerical methodology using the code LS-DYNA was developed. LS-DYNA is a commercially available multi-purpose finite-element code, which is well suited to various types of dynamic modeling. Two different element formulations were used — Euler formulation in, and close to, the <b>blast</b> <b>hole,</b> and Lagrange formulation in the rock volume farther from the <b>blast</b> <b>hole.</b> The models used have a resolution (element size) of 50 mm and comprise approximately 20 million elements.

40|$|Abstract. The {{two-dimensional}} discrete element program (UDEC) {{is applied}} to simulate the dampi-ng effect of empty <b>holes</b> on <b>blasting</b> vibration. The {{results show that the}} peak particle velocity of monitoring point on the condition that there are empty holes between monitoring point and <b>blast</b> <b>hole</b> is less than that without empty holes. The factors which have impact on cushioning effect, such as the depth of empty hole, the diameter of empty hole, the distance between empty <b>hole</b> and <b>blast</b> <b>hole</b> and the rows of empty hole, are investigated numerically. It is found that the depth of empty hole has dominated influence on the damping effect and the damping effect on blasting vibration strengthens with the increment of the depth. The diameter of empty hole and the distance between empty <b>hole</b> and <b>blast</b> <b>hole</b> have slight influence on the damping effect. The increment of rows of empty hole can enhance the damping effect on blasting vibration as well. The results in the present study may provide a reference for the application of empty hole to reduce the blasting vibration in practical engineering...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} a geostatistical study of diamond drill <b>holes</b> and <b>blast</b> <b>holes</b> and their {{potential}} use together in a cokriging system. Both measurements of a real copper deposit are formally compared, leading to a model where a <b>blast</b> <b>hole</b> {{can be considered as}} a regularization of the drill information up to a nugget effect characteristic of the blasts. This formal link makes it possible to build a cokriging system that accounts for the different supports and leads to a block model based on <b>blast</b> and drill <b>holes.</b> The model is tested on a realistic simulation where the true block grades, which are known, are compared to their estimate obtained by: - Kriging using only drill holes; - Kriging using only blast holes; - Cokriging using drill and <b>blast</b> <b>holes</b> together. The first conclusion is that the best estimate is obtained when only blasts or <b>blast</b> and drill <b>holes</b> are used together, there is no significant difference, there are too many blasts. This justifies the usual practice consisting in basing the short-term planning on blasts only. But another conclusion appears when kriging is compared to moving average (another common practice), both based on blasts: depending on the number of data used in the neighborhood, the moving average produces a strong conditional bias, a useful reminder of the reason why Kriging was created more than fifty years ago...|$|R

40|$|To {{describe}} the progressive effects of underground blasting on the surrounding site, a finite element approach is presented. The explosion energy is translated {{in a time}} history of pressure at the boundary of the <b>blast</b> <b>hole.</b> Cracking of the nearby rock mass is modelled according to a cohesive crack model, while elastic behaviour is assumed for the non cracked rock mass and soil deposits. Propagation of stress waves from the <b>blast</b> <b>hole</b> is simulated by a time domain 3 -D finite element analysis, which is able to provide the time history of all the relevant quantities describing the motion at any given distance. The numerical results can be post processed in order to derive attenuation laws for the most relevant quantities to which the codes of practice usually refer to, i. e., peak particle velocity and principal frequency of the vibration. The model is energy-conserving, thus the energy supplied by the explosive is correctly partitioned into fracture energy of the rock mass close to the <b>blast</b> <b>hole,</b> elastic energy providing the stress wave propagation and kinetic energy of the fragmented rock blocks. Numerical simulations of two literature case-histories are presented, and the numerical results are compared to the available experimental data. Experimental peak particle velocity could be captured remarkably. Principal frequencies for the rock mass could be reproduced as well. In layered sites, the ratio between the stiffness of the different media where stress waves propagate seems to {{play a key role}} in the determination of principal frequencies, while less influence is observed on peak particle velocities...|$|R
