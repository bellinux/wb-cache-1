40|$|Current {{advocacy}} {{on behalf}} of <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> accused of criminal offenses focuses on the now familiar <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome theory. Although the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome theory has enjoyed broad support when asserted by defendants claiming self-defense, the earnestness of the theory 2 ̆ 7 s judicial acceptance is questionable. First, in light of both empirical and analytical flaws in the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome theory, the overwhelming judicial acceptance of the theory is inconsistent with courts 2 ̆ 7 growing tendency to scrutinize scientific evidence. Second, courts {{have been reluctant to}} extend the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome theory to the defense of duress, where the theory would excuse <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> who commit crimes with their batterers against innocent parties. That the syndrome theory has been controversial in duress cases, and yet widely accepted in the self-defense context, despite its analytical and scientific flaws, suggests that the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome has been used in the self-defense context to help sympathetic actors. This paper recommends an alternative approach to understanding the conduct of <b>battered</b> <b>women.</b> The self-defense claims of justified <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> have failed not because <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> are qualitatively different than other actors, but because current self-defense rules are imperfect generally and do not encompass all necessary uses of defensive force. An alternative approach to these cases would treat <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> as rational actors and ask whether their use of defensive force was necessary. Unlike the prevailing approach to the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> cases, the recommended rational actor approach preserves the importance of objective standards when justifying defensive force. Moreover, an emphasis upon objective standards when applying criminal defenses reconciles the existing tension between the treatment of <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> in the duress and self-defense contexts. Viewed as rational actors and not psychologically impaired, <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> who defend themselves against their batterers have stronger normative claims that their conduct was necessary than <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> who appease their batterers by victimizing third parties...|$|R

40|$|The South Africa {{criminal}} law allows the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> {{to raise a}} <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome defence {{in the context of}} non-pathological criminal incapacity. However, there is a need of expert evidence to support such defence for it to succeed in the court of law. Hence, this paper scrutinizes the task of expert evidence in support of the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome in order to reach the extent of its effectiveness. Nevertheless, such evidence is not indispensable but without it, the court hardly gets persuaded resulting into the failure of the defence. The meaning of <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome is articulated in the paper as well as the fact that <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome defence falls under the defence of non-pathological criminal incapacity. The origin and development of the non-pathological criminal incapacity has also been discussed by comparing it with pathological criminal incapacity which emanates from mental illness while the former does not originate from a mental illness. Psychiatrist are {{in a better position to}} understand the latter while psychologists are in a better position to understand the former, hence it is advisable if the court pays more attention or attach more weight to the evidence given by the psychologists if this defence is to succeed and have a brilliant future. Moreover, the possible defences available to the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> have been mentioned as well as the cases that used non-pathological criminal incapacity as a defence particularly with regard to the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome defence. Both cases that were successful and unsuccessful have been elaborated. However, the cases that failed with the defence are in large numbers than the successful ones. Although expert evidence is essential to support the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome defence, it is unjustly and unfairly applied on the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> who is an accused person in the court leading to the failure of the defence. In short the use of expert evidence has failed in its application as the two professions, law and medicine has failed to make this defence work as they have not reached an agreement concerning the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome defence. In addition, the paper looks at the obstacles linked with the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome defence as well as offering suggestions to be put in place in order to make the use of expert evidence achievable. This can only be done if both the lawyers and mental health professionals come to terms with each other where they are able to understand the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome and the actions which led to the situation where <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> finds herself as an accused person. Finally, the paper concludes that expert evidence has failed tremendously in its application leading to the failure of the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome defence in the context of non-pathological criminal incapacity. Consequently a lot still needs to be done to protect the women who face numerous obstacles; both personal and legal as they do not face justice in court and everyone must take part to put an end to <b>battering</b> of <b>women</b> which is inhuman and morally wrong.

40|$|Despite the {{progress}} of the last three decades, the American public and even feminists remain caught in a web of ambivalence and contradictory attitudes and beliefs about <b>battered</b> <b>women.</b> Are <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> traumatized victims who suffer at the hands of their individual abusers and from the systemic failures of a male-dominated culture? Are they, therefore, unable to save themselves or their children? In contrast, are these women survivors who manage to protect themselves as best they can under uniquely difficult circumstances? Do they deserve recognition for their efforts, or do <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> somehow contribute to or exacerbate their own abuse and, therefore, share the blame for their violent predicaments? Conflicting beliefs about <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> have translated into conflicting policies and laws in the battle against domestic violence. This Article focuses on one conflict in particular: how policies and laws deal differently with the choices of <b>battered</b> <b>women.</b> The legal system gives, but also denies, <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> choices in a variety of ways. It acknowledges, but also refuses to acknowledge, the past choices of <b>battered</b> <b>women.</b> For example, some policies, particularly in the criminal justice system, consider <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> to be weak and helpless. These policies, consequently, deny women any choice, even though crucial decisions that seriously affect their lives are involved. Other laws, such as those concerning restraining orders, typically require <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> to make choices and to take the initiative in order to successfully resist their abusers. Still other practices are even more harsh because they retrospectively denounce the 2 ̆ 2 choices 2 ̆ 2 <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> have made, effectively punishing the women personally for their responses in situations that did not permit true choices. Do <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> have choices? 2 ̆ 2 Always, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Sometimes, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Never 2 ̆ 2 are each correct responses in the present hodgepodge of policies. This Article aims to draw attention to all the micro- and macro-level decisions that <b>battered</b> <b>women,</b> and particularly <b>battered</b> mothers, make throughout their experience of domestic violence. These decisions are opportunities for both the women and domestic violence policymakers. By understanding the motivations behind the decisions and incorporating those motivations into laws and policies, policymakers can do more by recognizing the choices of <b>battered</b> <b>women,</b> while heavily influencing their decisions. The system needs to identify and eliminate the troubling conflicts in its present policies by squarely confronting the agency that <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> have, accepting the agency, and using it to an advantage in battling domestic violence. The choices <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> make are significant ones and policies should aim to improve them. This is especially true of battered mothers whose actions impact not only themselves, but also their children. Part II of this Article begins with an examination of some current policies in the fight against domestic violence and their contrary positions on the choices of <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> and on the victim-agent debate. Part III then explores in detail the history and contours of the victim-agent debate, including the significant contributions of Lenore Walker and Elizabeth Schneider in moving the image of <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> closer to reality. The agency of <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> should not be feared or merely punished in hindsight; instead, as Part IV explains, it should be recognized, accepted, and assisted by both feminist theorists and policymakers. Finally, the Article concludes in Part V by focusing on battered mothers and failure to protect proceedings as a prime example of where agency can be used effectively to interrupt the vicious cycle of family violence. It specifically proposes that where evidence of abuse against mothers exists, there be a mandatory probationary period of intensive counseling and support services for battered mothers prior to any removal of the children, and prior to definitive findings of child neglect or child abuse, or any termination of parental rights...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{cyclical}} {{model of}} domestic violence it is implied that <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> are sensitized to violence {{and are more likely}} to perceive danger in situations when others might not.

40|$|Despite growing {{awareness}} {{of the severity of}} domestic violence, the lives of <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> are too often misconstrued by the Canadian public and the judicial system.

The {{first part of the}} article then goes on to develop the how these barriers impact <b>battered</b> <b>women.</b> One of the abuse dynamics used by many men who batter is the control of economic resources. <b>Battered</b> <b>women</b> thus often face barriers that on the surface seem unrelated to the domestic violence. The lack of financial resources, including the lack of access to joint resources, means <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> face additional barriers to housing needs.

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Public Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME AND CRIMINAL LIABILITY. The {{effect of}} {{prolonged}} abuse {{on a woman}} has been labelled as "learned helplessness". The theory of learned helplessness presupposes that {{a woman who is}} continuously abused by her partner will eventually accept her abuse as unavoidable and will develop a feeling of helplessness. Therefore the theory of learned helplessness gives an explanation for the psychological helplessness that <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> experience. Later the concept of learned helplessness was developed into the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome. The term "battered woman syndrome" refers to the physical and psychological characteristics found in the victims of prolonged abuse between intimate partners. The theory of "learned helplessness" supports the cycle of violence theory by giving an explanation for the failure of <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> to leave their abusers and to act in order to better their situation. However, when a <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> acts and kills her abuser, the question that arises is whether her abuse can influence the general requirements of unlawfulness, conduct and fault. By successfully relying on private defence, the unlawfulness of a battered woman's conduct can be excluded. The imminence-requirement in the case of private defence can complicate a battered woman's reliance on the defence. An expansion of the imminence-requirement to accommodate murderous <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> carries the risk that <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> may misuse private defence. Battered women's reliance on private defence should therefore be restricted to cases where their abusers' attack is imminent. A <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> can only be criminally liable for her voluntary conduct. Involuntary conduct (automatism) excludes criminal liability and is also connected to incapacity. A <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> can rely on non-pathological incapacity as a defence. In order to be successful she will have to lead evidence which indicates that she temporarily acted involuntary {{at the time of her}} abuser's killing. A battered woman's years of abuse, her helplessness and her emotional and psychological run down state of mind can also be taken into account in finding that her capacity during the killing of her abuser was diminished and that she deserves a more lenient sentence. Capacity is a prerequisite for fault. A <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> who does not have criminal capacity will not possess any fault and will therefore not be criminally liable for the killing of her abuser. Recently some criminal law developments took place in Australia, England and Wales. These developments specifically address the situation in which <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> find themselves. The question, therefore, is whether South Africa can learn something from these developments. It appears as if South Africa will not be able to learn something from the developments in Australia. In the case of private defence, the imminence requirement was expanded in Victoria and Western Australia to accommodate <b>battered</b> <b>women.</b> It has, however, already been shown that such an expansion can lead to a misuse of private defence by <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> in South Africa. South Africa will also not be able to learn much from the reform of provocation in the Northern-Territory. The reason for this is that the South African position with regard to the defence of provocation is more advantageous than the reform of the defence in the Northern-Territory. In South Africa diminished responsibility is only taken into account for purposes of sentencing. The South African criminal law can therefore be benefited by the creation of a defence of diminished responsibility in a similar manner than the reform of diminished responsibility in England and Wales. Diminished responsibility will then constitute a complete defence which can lead to a complete acquittal for <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> who kill their abusers. To determine whether a separate defence can be created for <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> in South Africa, an investigation into suggested defences in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa was launched. Arguments for the creation of a separate defence are, however, overshadowed by the arguments against the creation of such a defence. Therefore, the creation of a separate defence for <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> is not recommended for the South African law. By accepting the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome as a separate defence, the South African law also runs the risk of being impaired, rather than helped. It is therefore advisable for South African courts to rather carry on treating murderous <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> in accordance with existing, recognized grounds of justification. Master...|$|R

Most of these women were {{sent to prison for}} killing their abusers in defense of themselves or their children. The legal, political, and social forces that influence the criminal trials of such women frequently ensure high conviction rates and stiff sentences.

40|$|M. Sc. The {{present study}} explores the {{personal}} narratives of three <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> {{who have been}} involved in the killing of their batterers, with regards to the processes of the perpetuation of abuse and victimising patterns in contexts of the battering - relationships, the criminal justice system and the prison system, which contribute to the co-creation of the women's sense of self and identity. The narratives unfold from a prison setting, where these three women are serving long-term sentences. The narratives are described within a social constructionist perspective. Two-tape recorded conversations of an hour and a half were held with each of the participants in this study. The conversations included a written dialogue from the women. In-depth interviews were used to guide the emerging narratives. The reflections of the researcher are linked to the analysis of the co-created narratives. The narratives suggest that the recognition of these women as victims of violence is clouded by the need for larger systems, namely, the criminal justice system and the prison system to identify the women as perpetrators of violence. The prison system parallels the battering relationship in positioning the women as victims. Suggestions around the treatment of- <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> who kill in prison, include communally validating the experiences and feelings of these women through the processes of group therapy. Re-categorising the women in prison, as <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> who kill, rather than murderers so as to recognise the context of the <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> is suggested. Community service is considered as an alternative to long term imprisonment. Community outreach programs from prison to share knowledge of <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> who kill is also suggested. Government policies, where possible, should be made accessible and government sponsored shelters should be established so as to recognise <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> who kill as victims of violence.

Self-defense law is based on male on male combat. Women are less able to protect themselves in an attack by a man, and so they may preemptively attack their sleeping partners to avoid a situation in which they cannot adequately protect themselves. <b>Battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome explains why these <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> act in a way that is irrational to a non-battered person. Walker 2 ̆ 7 s theory of learned helplessness explains why the woman does not leave the abusive relationship, and the cycle of violence theory explains why she perceives an imminent threat. <b>Battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome is problematic in its legal application because of problems with its scientific validity and reliability. It also furthers gender stereotypes and blurs the line between a justification and an excuse defense. While, Dr. Walker 2 ̆ 7 s intentions were good, <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome is inadequate. Women 2 ̆ 7 s difference from men still have to be acknowledged in cases in which <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> kill their husband 2 ̆ 7 s, but social agency framework is a more effective way to acknowledge gender differences. This framework takes into account social circumstances that would explain a woman 2 ̆ 7 s actions rather than including pathology. This would explain why the woman did not leave an abusive relationship. To avoid the pathology of BWS while explaining why the woman felt an imminent threat, the defense can turn to a pattern of abuse that helps her reasonably recognize when violence is likely...|$|R
