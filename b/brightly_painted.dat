5|$|Maya stelae were {{worked with}} stone chisels and {{probably}} with wooden mallets. Hammerstones were fashioned from flint and basalt and {{were used for}} shaping the softer rocks used to make stelae, while fine detail was completed with smaller chisels. Originally most were probably <b>brightly</b> <b>painted</b> in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours using mineral and organic pigments. At Copán and some other Maya cities, some traces of these pigments were found upon the monuments.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of stelae {{have been}} {{recorded}} in the Maya region, displaying a wide stylistic variation. Many are upright slabs of limestone sculpted on one or more faces, with available surfaces sculpted with figures carved in relief and with hieroglyphic text. Stelae in a few sites display a much more three-dimensional appearance where locally available stone permits, such as at Copán and Toniná. Plain stelae {{do not appear to}} have been painted nor overlaid with stucco decoration, but most Maya stelae were probably <b>brightly</b> <b>painted</b> in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours.|$|E
5|$|The largest Maya sculptures {{consisted}} of architectural façades crafted from stucco. The rough form {{was laid out}} on a plain plaster base coating on the wall, and the three-dimensional form was built up using small stones. Finally, this was coated with stucco and moulded into the finished form; human body forms were first modelled in stucco, with their costumes added afterwards. The final stucco sculpture was then <b>brightly</b> <b>painted.</b> Giant stucco masks were used to adorn temple façades by the Late Preclassic, and such decoration continued into the Classic period.|$|E
5000|$|Nancy Metz White is a Wisconsin {{artist with}} {{large-scale}} outdoor public sculptures installed in two parks in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. White welds and sometimes <b>brightly</b> <b>paints</b> steel and forge flashings reclaimed from Milwaukee heavy industry. She {{describes herself as}} a practitioner of urban archeology.|$|R
5000|$|Sanctioned horse {{shows have}} {{extremely}} strict, uniform rules for types of obstacles allowed, distances and sizes used for agility obstacles, and rules for time allowed for each obstacle. [...] Course designers often add both beauty and challenge to a course by adding potted shrubs, flowers, and <b>brightly</b> <b>painting</b> various obstacle elements.|$|R

5|$|The solar block has two storeys and a cellar, {{and would}} have {{probably}} acted as the living space for Laurence of Ludlow when he first moved into the castle. The solar room itself is on the first floor, and is reached by external steps. The wood panelling and carved wooden fireplace are of 17th-century origin, probably from around 1640. This woodwork would have originally been <b>brightly</b> <b>painted,</b> and included spy-holes so that the hall could be observed from the solar.|$|E
5|$|The {{structures}} at Zaculeu {{were grouped}} around small plazas and were generally built from masonry, {{coated with a}} thick layer of plaster. Fragments bear floral and geometric designs, indicating the structures were originally <b>brightly</b> <b>painted.</b> Stones were undressed and cemented in adobe mortar. No evidence of corbel vaulting has been found and very {{little in the way of}} stone sculpture. The architecture completely lacks stone sculpture. Burials from the Early Classic yielded a rich array of finds, but Late Classic burials were accompanied by a lesser variety of grave offerings.|$|E
5|$|The choir has broad arches {{with two}} wave {{mouldings}} carried down the piers which support the ribs of the vaulting. These {{may have been}} designed by Thomas Witney or William Joy as they {{are similar to the}} work at Wells Cathedral and St Mary Redcliffe. The choir is separated from the eastern Lady Chapel by a 14th-century reredos which was damaged in The reformation and repaired in 1839 when the 17th-century altarpiece was removed. The Lady Chapel was <b>brightly</b> <b>painted</b> in the late 19th and early 20th centuries following existing fragments of colour. To the south east of the choir and Lady Chapel is the Berkeley Chapel and an adjoining antechapel or sacristy, which may have been added in the 14th century, possibly replacing an earlier structure.|$|E
5000|$|Margaret Paraskos is {{predominantly}} a painter. According to the Greek newspaper Kathimerini {{her work is}} 'inspired by philosophy, mythology, the poetry of Homer and Ovid and the bucolic life'. These elements lead to <b>brightly</b> coloured <b>painted</b> canvases that are 'characterised by free flowing gestures.' ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>brightly</b> colored <b>painting</b> and {{confident}} subject represent {{a shift in}} Van Gogh's attitude in comparison to his earlier subjects, such as his dark and tragic peasants. Even more, van Gogh's Portrait of Père Tanguy from {{the fall of the}} same year further explores his use of color and better promotes his Japanese prints.|$|R
5000|$|HSV models {{itself on}} paint mixture, with its {{saturation}} and value dimensions resembling mixtures of a <b>brightly</b> colored <b>paint</b> with, respectively, white and black. HSL tries to resemble more perceptual color models such as NCS or Munsell. It places the fully saturated colors {{in a circle}} of lightness ½, so that lightness 1 always implies white, and lightness 0 always implies black.|$|R
5|$|This {{multi-storied}} ruin, {{the best-known}} cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde, {{is located in}} the largest alcove {{in the center of the}} Great Mesa. It was south- and southwest-facing, providing greater warmth from the sun in the winter. Dating back more than 700 years, the dwelling is constructed of sandstone, wooden beams, and mortar. Many of the rooms were <b>brightly</b> <b>painted.</b> Cliff Palace was home to approximately 125 people, but was likely an important part of a larger community of sixty nearby pueblos, which housed a combined six hundred or more people. With 23 kivas and 150 rooms, Cliff Palace is the largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Aboriginal peoples {{used the}} {{materials}} at hand {{to make their}} instruments for centuries before Europeans immigrated to Canada. First Nations people made gourds and animal horns into rattles, which were elaborately carved and <b>brightly</b> <b>painted.</b> In woodland areas, they made horns of birch bark and drumsticks of carved antlers and wood. Traditional percussion instruments such as drums were generally made of carved wood and animal hides. These musical instruments provide the background for songs, and songs the background for dances. Traditional First Nations people consider song and dance to be sacred. For years after Europeans came to Canada, First Nations people were forbidden to practice their ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The churches {{had three}} aisles, divided by wooden columns, often solomonic columns, carved with twisted fluting {{resembling}} those at St. Peter's baldachin in St Peter's, Rome. Until modern times, {{there were no}} pews so the congregation had to kneel or sit on the floor. A variety of fine pieces of art adorn {{the inside of the}} churches, notably their altars, which are sometimes covered in gold, silver or mica. Especially remarkable are the pulpits made of <b>brightly</b> <b>painted</b> wood and supported by carved sirens. The pulpit in the church of San Miguel de Velasco features motifs derived from local vegetation. Elements specific to the Chiquitos missions exist also in other decorations. The altars of the churches of San Xavier and Concepción include depictions of notable Jesuits together with indigenous peoples. There remain a handful of original sculptures in retablos often depicting Madonnas, the crucifixion, and saints, carved in wood and then painted. These sculptures exhibit a style unique to the Chiquitos region, differing from that of the reductions in Paraguay or the Bolivian highlands. The tradition of figure carving has been preserved to the present day in workshops where carvers make columns, finials and windows for new or restored churches or chapels in the area. In addition, carvers produce decorative angels and other figures for the tourist market.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>brightly</b> colored <b>painting</b> and {{confident}} subject represent {{a shift in}} Vincent's attitude. Van Gogh called his use of bright colors [...] "gymnastics" [...] that through experimentation created great depth, harmony and balance in his work. [...] The painting contains a background of van Gogh's Japanese prints that were sold at Tanguy's shop. On top of Tanguy's hat is Mount Fuji; Kabuki actors share the wall with cherry trees in bloom.|$|R
5000|$|Lewis's unique drip {{painting}} technique allowed {{different colors}} of paint to combine without mixing while retaining a wet look. These cascades of paint leaked from canvases and spilled {{onto the floor}} of the exhibition space. Christopher Bollen, Editor-in-Chief of Interview Magazine, called this method of Lewis' [...] "making art bleed." [...] "The artist allows the gash to “bleed” <b>brightly</b> colored <b>paint</b> (which he has applied), in order to express a transient and dying glamor." ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries {{it was very}} {{expensive}} to ship furniture to New Mexico. Hispanic carpenters built, with great artistry, cajas (storage chests), harineros (grain chests), trasteros (kitchen cupboards) and other furniture. The work was generally carved and <b>painted</b> <b>brightly.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} two seasons, the opening {{sequence}} was set in a room covered with painters' tarps. Each cast member, wearing black-and-white, played with <b>brightly</b> colored <b>paint</b> {{in a different way}} (throwing globs of it at the camera by hand, using a roller to cover the camera lens, etc.). The sequence ended with a segue to a set built to resemble the rooftop of an apartment building, where the show's dancers performed a routine and opened a door to let Keenen Ivory Wayans greet a live audience.|$|R
50|$|A {{music video}} was {{produced}} for the song, directed by Yutaka Kimura. It features Ochi, {{wearing a white}} coat and hat, in a white room with mirrors. Artist Ryo Matsuoka walks {{into the room with}} cans of <b>brightly</b> colored <b>paint</b> and begins to paint the mirrors with his hands. Paint increasingly covers Ochi's face, arms, and clothes as well. After the mirrors are painted, they shatter, with glass shards raining down around Ochi. She then walks out of the room, echoing the video's introductory sequence, as the song ends.|$|R
25|$|Since the Christianization of Kievan Rus' {{for several}} ages Russian {{architecture}} was influenced predominantly by the Byzantine architecture. Apart from fortifications (kremlins), the main stone buildings of ancient Rus' were Orthodox churches with their many domes, often gilded or <b>brightly</b> <b>painted.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many rural {{households}} in the Mexican state of Oaxaca have prospered {{over the past three}} decades through the sale of <b>brightly</b> <b>painted,</b> whimsical wood carvings they call alebrijes to international tourists and the owners of ethnic arts shops in the United States, Canada, and Europe. What are called “alebrijes” in Oaxaca is a marriage of native woodcarving traditions and influence from Pedro Linares’ work in Mexico City.|$|E
25|$|Agit-trains were {{frequently}} 16 to 18 cars in length. They were brightly colored, bearing flags with the cars <b>brightly</b> <b>painted</b> with slogans and political art. Leading Bolshevik {{artists such as}} Vladimir Mayakovsky (1893-1930), El Lissitsky (1890-1941), and Kazimir Malevich (1878-1935) were commissioned to paint car exteriors and their work was bold and memorable, albeit sometimes criticized as too abstract for a poorly educated and largely uncultured rural audience.|$|E
50|$|Bessels Green has {{a village}} green and one public house, the King's Head. The <b>brightly</b> {{coloured}} <b>painted</b> cottages {{on the eastern}} side of the green form a colourful backdrop to traffic passing through the village on the busy A25 and are part of some of the iconic street and country scenes of the Sevenoaks area. There are two churches; the Bessels Green Unitarian Meeting House (built 1716) and the Bessels Green Baptist Church (c. 1771). There is easy accessibility to 3 primary schools, Chevening C.E.P Primary school, Riverhead Infants School and Amherst Junior School.|$|R

She became {{an active member}} of the Önningeby artists colony on the island of Åland where she became a friend of Eva Acke. Her 1893 painting of Önningeby shows Eva Maria Topelius strolling with J.A.G. Acke, her husband to be. She returned to Önningeby as late as 1920 as evidenced by one of her paintings.|$|R
2500|$|The Gweagal Aborigines {{were the}} guardians of the sacred white clay pits in their territory. Members of the tribe walked {{hundreds}} of miles to collect the clay, it was considered sacred amongst the indigenous locals and had many uses. They used it to line the base of their canoes so they could light fires, and also as a white body paint, (as witnessed by Captain James Cook). [...] Colour {{was added to the}} clay using berries, which produced a <b>brightly</b> coloured <b>paint</b> that was used in ceremonies. It was also eaten as a medicine, an antacid. Geebungs and other local berries were mixed in the clay and it was eaten as a dietary supplement with zinc.|$|R
25|$|An {{upper level}} {{was added to}} the cloister between 1350 and 1360, reached by a monumental stairway. The {{builders}} added a wooden ceiling to the lower level and decorated the <b>brightly</b> <b>painted</b> panels with biblical scenes, fantastic animals, and scenes of daily life. Only half of the paintings remain today, and the bright colours have been faded by oxidation, but they provide a remarkable look at medieval life and the medieval imagination.|$|E
25|$|Russian domes {{are often}} gilded or <b>brightly</b> <b>painted.</b> A {{dangerous}} technique of chemical gilding using mercury had been applied on some occasions until the mid-19th century, {{most notably in}} the giant dome of Saint Isaac's Cathedral. The more modern and safe method of gold electroplating was applied {{for the first time}} in gilding the domes of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, the tallest Eastern Orthodox church in the world.|$|E
25|$|The second storey is {{supported}} on six pillars {{and the space}} {{is divided into two}} arched spaces. To the right and facing right in prayer is Sir George Shirley with his two sons behind him. All three figures are dressed in <b>brightly</b> <b>painted</b> period dress and the clothes include details in gold. In the left arch is his wife (d. 1595), daughter, and two babies. According to the Latin inscription, Shirley's wife died aged 29 whilst giving birth.|$|E
5000|$|Jean-Baptiste Fresez and Nicolas Liez {{who both}} painted the City of Luxembourg and its {{surroundings}} were the country's most important 19th-century artists. Jean Jacoby, who was awarded two Olympic gold medals for his artwork and, above all, Joseph Kutter with his Expressionist landscapes and portraits, were notable {{during the first}} half of the 20th century. Kutter's <b>brightly</b> coloured <b>painting</b> of [...] "Luxembourg", commissioned for the 1937 World Exposition in Paris reveals his mature Expressionist style, of which there is more than natural emphasis on how the houses appear to be stacked up one behind the other, how the buildings take on almost cubic contours and how the fortifications tower powerfully above the valley.|$|R
5000|$|Favro {{began his}} career <b>painting</b> <b>brightly</b> {{coloured}} works on masonite. A Canada Council Arts Bursary in 1970 allowed him to devote himself to quit painting to pursue his other interests - guitars, machines, airplanes, and experiments with film images and inventions. [...] That year he developed his first successful [...] "projected reconstruction," [...] in which images on a slide are projected onto their wooden, white, life-sized counterparts, giving them colour, detail and identity.|$|R
6000|$|... 153. Why did not Sir Joshua--or could not--or {{would not}} Sir Joshua--paint Madonnas? neither he, nor his great rival-friend Gainsborough? Both of them {{painters}} of women, such as since Giorgione and Correggio {{had not been}}; both painters of men, such as had not been since Titian. How is it that these English friends can so <b>brightly</b> <b>paint</b> that particular order of humanity which we call [...] "gentlemen and ladies," [...] but neither heroes, nor saints, nor angels? Can it be because they were both country-bred boys, and for ever after strangely sensitive to courtliness? Why, Giotto also was a country-bred boy. Allegri's native Correggio, Titian's Cadore, were but hill villages; yet these men painted, not the court, nor the drawing-room, but the Earth: and not a little of Heaven besides: while our good Sir Joshua never trusts himself outside the park palings. He could not even have drawn the strawberry girl, unless she had got through a gap in them--or rather, I think, {{she must have been}} let in at the porter's lodge, for her strawberries are in a pottle, ready for the ladies at the Hall. Giorgione would have set them, wild and fragrant, among their leaves, in her hand. Between his fairness, and Sir Joshua's May-fairness, there is a strange, impassable limit--as of the white reef that in Pacific isles encircles their inner lakelets, and shuts them from the surf and sound of sea. Clear and calm they rest, reflecting fringed shadows of the palm-trees, and the passing of fretted clouds across their own sweet circle of blue sky. But beyond, and round and round their coral bar, lies the blue of sea and heaven together--blue of eternal deep.|$|R
