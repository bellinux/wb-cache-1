The study deals with thermal analysis of the busbar, both using numerical simulations in SolidWorks and practical examination – warming of the busbar. We can verify the correctness of the simulation from the measured values. To determine the temperature profile of the busbar, it is necessary to measure the temperature at various points of the busbar by contact method using thermocouple or contactless method using a thermal imager. Measurements are performed at the busbar LIA 1600 made by Siemens <b>Busbar</b> <b>Trunking</b> <b>System</b> Mohelnice.

For example, a six-channel <b>trunked</b> <b>system</b> may have two transmit antennas with three transmitters connected {{to each of}} the two transmit antennas. Because small variations affect every antenna, each antenna will have a slightly different directional pattern. Each antenna will interact with the tower and other nearby antennas differently. If one were to measure received signal levels, this would cause a variation among channels on a single <b>trunked</b> <b>system.</b> Variations in signal strength among channels on one <b>trunked</b> <b>system</b> can also be caused by: ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{dedicated}} to the effect of surface modification on lid warming of <b>busbar</b> <b>trunking</b> <b>system</b> BD 2 which is manufactured by Siemens company in Mohelnice town (CZ). By using experimental methods, it investigates heat transfer by radiation and natural convection. It evaluates which type of surface modification is more effective by transfer heat. This study uses a method of emisivity comparison and a procedure given in standards for heat up test afterwards. It led to recognition, that various colour shades used on busbar system have similar high emissivity. Smooth colour spraying transfers heat a bit more effectively than rough colour spraying. Outputs of supplementary measurements give basis for numerical simulations in SolidWorks software. Numerical analysis assists to interpret results, for example by sensitivity study of heat transfer depending on emissivity...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the low-frequency magnetic field generated from an unbalanced current source {{in the presence of a}} cylindrical shell. Analytical expressions of the magnetic field are given, as well as the shielding mechanism and shielding performance of the shell. The impulse magnetic field generated from a lightning discharge current in a coaxial cable is also addressed. It is not always correct that a conducting shell or enclosure is the panacea to shielding every kind of excitation. The shell may become a vain attempt at magnetic shielding if the source current is not balanced within the enclosure, such as the bend of a <b>busbar</b> <b>trunking</b> <b>system.</b> The presence of the enclosure may only result in a change in the distribution of the magnetic field. Effective shielding is achieved if the monopole field from the source is cancelled. This can be realised by placing the returning-current filament internally or injecting the current in the shell.

40|$|In modern {{developing}} world, ICT (Information and Communication Technology) usage {{is rapidly}} increasing and all commercial buildings comprise with very sensitive telecommunication equipments {{in order to}} facilitate day to day requirements. All such equipments are interconnected with network cable wiring system unless few remote operating equipments exist. On the other hand, building electrical wiring system is also laid throughout the building. In this context, it may have opportunity to interfere unwanted electrical noise to the data and voice systems hence malfunction or giving flaw data outputs. Electrical noise cause for an abnormal humming sound of the voice signals and thereby degrade the quality of sound systems. Such interference can happen due to both radiated and conductive electrical noise. One of major reasons for the conducted noise is, operation of switched mode power supplies hence lead to create of earth loops that should eliminate at the design and installation stages. Analysis of electrical noise in the system and design filtering systems need to be practiced, when noise issues are raised after the commissioning of electrical installations. It is required to do analyzing of electrical noise in the building in order to come across comprehensive conclusion for root cause for the disturbances. In doing so, harmonic levels, noise in the live wires, noise through the earth wire and earth loop possibilities are investigated. The most important part is to identify major frequency components filter those from the system. Different type of filter arrangements can be used to evaluate its performances against the noise level of the site. Similarly, installation guide lines can be followed prior to the site erection and that is the very effective method to avoid unnecessary noise induced in sensitive equipments. Though general filter arrangements eliminate noise, some frequency ranges need to be filtered separately, according to the site conditions. Since calculated L and C values can’t be exactly found out, next closet practical values were chosen thereby cutoff frequency is slightly shifted. Simulation results, for common mode noise filtering indicate, 106 Hz to 107 Hz minimal variation of cutoff frequency and 0. 03 variation in damping factor. Earth leakage currents drastically reduced with increasing of the earth line choke and that is possible way to control common mode noise. Introducing separate earth cables instead of single copper tape in the vertical <b>busbar</b> <b>trunking</b> <b>system,</b> is the elimination method of the earth loops between floors at far apart in the high rise building. Besides, it is required to use same earth termination point for the camera and the display system of the CCTV system in high rise buildings...|$|E
