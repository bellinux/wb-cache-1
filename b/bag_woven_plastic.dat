40|$|According as the {{international}} definition of Flexible Scope, a laboratory must demonstrate face with the accreditation body that it has the knowledge, experience and competence {{to work within the}} full range of its flexible scope, as well as possessing suitable laboratory environments and equipment. The laboratory must also demonstrate that it has a management system in place that can control its proposed approach while continuing to comply with the requirements of ISO 17025 : 2005. In case of UKAS (Unites Kingdom Accreditation Service), prior to offering accreditation for flexible scope they must have a high degree of confidence that the staff are technically competent and that the management system controlling certain key processes as development, review, validation and authorization. LATU apply these requirements since 2004 as "Unified Tests". Until this date, LATU was doing the same type of tests in different materials departments using different equipment, personal, and testing quality control. In order to that were defined cross disciplinary groups to analyze this topic approaching in personal competence and quality control tests improvement, and resource's decrease. For example, LATU has the Unified Test Tensile Strength accredited by UKAS in: corrugated and solid fiberboard, paper board, linerboard, cork plugs, plastic <b>bags,</b> <b>plastic</b> sheeting, paper, <b>woven</b> fabrics, <b>plastic</b> <b>woven</b> <b>bags</b> and <b>woven</b> <b>plastic.</b> As a result of the Unified Tests was generated a general unified manage procedure with unified criteria's, responsibilities and actions. Was written a unique testing procedure not only with the actual flexible scope and the flexibilities limits but also the compliance requirements of ISO 17025 and the accreditations body methodology. We could decrease the amount of documentation to control. Was defined the methodology and implemented periodicaly internal inter comparisons between departments in order to valid the unified tests and has a unique calculation method of uncertainty of measurement for tests performed in different departments. The equipment joint control allows everybody to use all the equipment, optimization resources and assurance the maintenance and calibration of them. The training together lead to the polyvalence personal. <br /...|$|R

Traditionally, the cassava is grated {{and placed in a}} press <b>bag</b> (<b>woven</b> with thatch leaves) and placed in an outdoor press where heavy stones are loaded on.

50|$|<b>Bags</b> were {{sometimes}} <b>woven</b> {{with a face}} of soumak, with a tapestry-woven kilim-like top creating slits between blocks of colour: a rope was threaded {{in and out of}} the series of slits to fasten and close the bag. Sizes vary, from carpet format through bags for bedding or for use on pack animals, to tiny tribal domestic bags. The following images show the appearance and construction of just such a soumak saddle <b>bag,</b> <b>woven</b> in Luristan at the end of the 20th century. The Lurs sometimes, as here, combine soumak and knotted carpet piling to adorn a single piece. To form the motifs, the weaver may push the weft threads about to form curves or slanting shapes as desired.|$|R
40|$|Interest {{in using}} {{hermetic}} technologies as a pest management solution for stored grain has risen in recent years. One hermetic approach, Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bags, has proven successful in controlling the postharvest pests of cowpea. This success encouraged farmers {{to use of}} PICS bags for storing other crops including maize. To assess whether maize can be safely stored in PICS bags without loss of quality, we carried out laboratory studies of maize grain infested with Sitophilus zeamais (Motshulsky) and stored in PICS triple <b>bags</b> or in <b>woven</b> polypropylene <b>bags.</b> Over an eight month observation period, temperatures in the bags correlated with ambient temperature for all treatments. Relative humidity inside PICS bags remained constant over this period despite the large changes {{that occurred in the}} surrounding environment. Relative humidity in the <b>woven</b> <b>bags</b> followed ambient humidity closely. PICS bags containing S. zeamais-infested grain saw a significant decline in oxygen compared to the other treatments. Grain moisture content declined in <b>woven</b> <b>bags,</b> but remained high in PICS bags. Seed germination was not significantly affected over the first six months in all treatments, but declined after eight months of storage when infested grain was held in <b>woven</b> <b>bags.</b> Relative damage was low across treatments and not significantly different between treatments. Overall, maize showed no signs of deterioration in PICS <b>bags</b> versus the <b>woven</b> <b>bags</b> and PICS bags were superior to <b>woven</b> <b>bags</b> in terms of specific metrics of grain quality...|$|R

50|$|A {{low grade}} {{concrete}} may {{be placed in}} <b>woven</b> <b>plastic</b> sacks {{similar to that used}} for sandbags and then emplaced. The sacks are then watered and the emplacement then becomes a series of artificial stones that conform to one another and to adjacent soil and structures. This conformation makes them resistant to displacement. The sack becomes non-functional and eventually disintegrates. This type of masonry is frequently used to protect the entrances and exits of water conduits where a road passes over a stream or dry wash. It is also used to protect stream banks from erosion, especially where a road passes close by.|$|R

50|$|The basic {{construction}} method {{begins by}} digging a trench down to undisturbed mineral subsoil. Rows of <b>woven</b> <b>bags</b> (or tubes) {{are filled with}} available material, placed into this trench, compacted with a pounder to around 1/3 thickness of pre-pounded thickness, and form a foundation. Each successive layer will have one or more strands of barbed wire placed on top. This digs into the <b>bag's</b> <b>weave</b> and prevents slippage of subsequent layers, and also resists any tendency for the outward expansion of walls. The next row of bags is offset by half a bag's width to form a staggered pattern. These are either pre-filled with material and delivered, or filled in place (often the case with Superadobe). The weight of this earth-filled bag pushes down on the barbed wire strands, locking the bag in place on the row below. The same process continues layer upon layer, forming walls. A roof can be formed by gradually sloping the walls inward to construct a dome. Traditional types of roof can also be made.|$|R

Sepak takraw is a high speed court game predominantly played in Southeast Asia using mainly the legs and head. The sepak takraw ball is unique because it is not enclosed and made of <b>woven</b> <b>plastic.</b> Hence a study of its aerodynamics would give insight into its behaviour under different conditions of play. In this study the dynamics of the fluid around a static sepak takraw ball was investigated at different wind speeds for three different orientations using CFD. It was found that although the drag did not differ very much, increasing the wind velocity causes an increase in drag. The lift coefficient varies as the velocity increases and does not show a regular pattern. The drag and lift coefficients are influenced by the orientation of the sepak takraw ball...|$|R
