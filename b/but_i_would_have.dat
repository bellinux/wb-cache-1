She wrote about the ideal qualities found in an actress, and what girls might do to develop them. She received a torrent of letters from readers—many were from girls asking [...] "Must I be able to ride" [...] and [...] "Must I be able to swim". In response, Michelena described in the column how those skills were helpful to a movie actress, but not absolutely necessary; she said they [...] "are accessories to, rather than {{the substance of the}} thing... I would advise every girl entering motion pictures to learn to ride and swim and do all the rest of it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> her realize their subordination to the really artistic side of the profession." ...|$|E

HBO quickly picked up the project, but only offered a fraction of the original budget of $14 million. Tisch said, [...] "HBO said they wanted to make the movie, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> less than $5 million to make it. It was exactly the same movie, but it all worked out." [...] Janet Harduvel appeared in an uncredited cameo role, and acted as a creative consultant on the film.

2500|$|While United {{were eager}} to extend the loan deal, Larsson stated {{that he had made}} a promise to his family and his club to return on 12 March.

Despite this, Sir Alex Ferguson was full of praise for the striker, who scored 3 goals in 13 matches in all competitions during his three-month stay, saying, [...] "He's been fantastic for us, his professionalism, his attitude, everything he's done has been excellent." [...] "We would love him to stay but, obviously, he has made his promise to his family and Helsingborg and I think we should respect that – <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done anything to keep him."

2500|$|After {{enduring}} {{several years}} of seeing his fame and notoriety usurped by Ruth, Cobb decided {{that he was going}} to show that swinging for the fences was no challenge for a top hitter. On May 5, 1925, he began a two-game hitting spree better than any even Ruth had unleashed. Sitting in the Tiger dugout, he told a reporter that, for the first time in his career, he was going to swing for the fences. That day, he went 6 for 6, with two singles, a double and three home runs. The 16 total bases set a new AL record, which stood until May 8, 2012 when Josh Hamilton of the Texas Rangers hit four home runs and a double for a total of 18 bases. The next day he had three more hits, two of which were home runs. The single his first time up gave him nine consecutive hits over three games. His five homers in two games tied the record set by Cap Anson of the old Chicago NL team in 1884. Cobb wanted to show that he could hit home runs when he wanted, but simply chose not to do so. At the end of the series, the 38-year-old veteran superstar had gone 12 for 19 with 29 total bases and then went happily back to his usual bunting and hitting-and-running. For his part, Ruth's attitude was that [...] "I could have had a lifetime [...]600 average, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had to hit them singles. The people were paying to see me hit home runs." [...] Even so, when asked in 1930 by Grantland Rice to name the best hitter he'd ever seen, Cobb answered, [...] "You can't beat the Babe. Ruth is one of the few who can take a terrific swing and still meet the ball solidly. His timing is perfect. [...] the combined power and eye of Ruth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Evert {{went into}} the 1982 Australian Open, having never won the tournament down under, which she wanted to rectify that fact and the gap on her grand slam resume. [...] Evert's {{opponent}} in the final was Navratilova, who was the defending champion. [...] The final was tied as one set apeice, and {{went into the}} pivotal and crucial third set, which in the second game Evert broke Navratilova to go up two games to none. [...] But in the third game, Evert failed to hold serve and lost the game. Subsequently, Evert quickly took the break advantage back in the fourth game to lead three games to one, and held serve to go up four games to one, which Evert said [...] "I thought...this is it." [...] Evert would quickly come back to reality, when feisty Navratilova, held serve in the sixth game of the set, then broke Evert in the seventh game of the set to narrow the gap to four games to three. [...] All this time, Evert was thinking about last years final, which eluded her grasp. [...] This one would be different however because in the eight game would break Navratilova, and the ninth would go to 30-love on a splendid crosscourt forehand, which at match point she hit a blazing winner {{to the other side of}} the court. [...] This was Evert's first Australian Open, which completed her career grand slam, and her fourteenth slam title for her career just ten days before her twenty-eighth birthday. [...] Later, Evert told reporters [...] "I have wanted this tournament so badly. [...] Then it was over and I had won it...it was a very emotional moment for me because this title meant so much...the Australian title has been the missing link in my career. [...] I am not thinking about retiring, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> hated to look back in 10 years and see something missing from my career." ...|$|E
