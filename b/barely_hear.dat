500|$|Jack Nicholson, {{recounting the}} {{reaction}} to a screening of the film, states that the audience [...] "laughed so hard I could <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> the dialogue. I didn't quite register it right. It was as if I had forgotten it was a comedy since the shoot. I got all embarrassed because I'd never really had such a positive response before." ...|$|E
500|$|Leeds midfielder Albert Johanneson {{would become}} the first black player to play in an FA Cup final. However, before walking out onto the pitch Johanneson {{suffered}} racial abuse: “When we walked out, all I could hear was a cacophony of Zulu-like noises coming from the terraces. It was dreadful, I could <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> myself think for those screams. I wanted to run back down the tunnel." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{study of}} the {{rattling}} made by rattlesnakes of different species, the Canadian zoologists Brock Fenton and Lawrence Licht found that the sounds are always similar: they have rapid onset (starting suddenly, and reaching full volume in a few milliseconds); they consist of a [...] "broadband" [...] mixture of frequencies between 2kHz and 20kHz, with little energy either in the ultrasonic (above 20kHz) or in the rattlesnakes' hearing range (below 700Hz); and the frequencies do not change much with time (the rattling after 2 minutes having a similar spectrum to that at onset). There was no clear difference in the sounds made by the different species measured: Crotalus horridus, Crotalus adamanteus, Crotalus atrox, Crotalus cerastes, Crotalus viridis and Sistrurus catenatus. This pattern implies that the rattling [...] "could serve as a general attention-getting device", which [...] "is designed as a deimatic or startle display". Its similarity to the [...] "broadband, harsh sounds" [...] used as warning calls by birds and mammals may enhance its effectiveness. Since rattlesnakes can <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> the sound, it is unlikely to serve as any form of communication to other snakes of the same species. Finally, the sounds are not in themselves loud enough to cause pain and hence keep predators away.|$|E

[...] "Why, then, {{he shall}} {{come down and}} receive my {{commands}} here, this blessed night, under my uncle's roof! And I will ring him such a black sanctus, that he shall think the devil hath him by the skirts for a month to come, for <b>barely</b> <b>hearing</b> me." ...|$|R
5000|$|On November 9, 2011, {{the first}} National EAS Test was {{conducted}} (as described above). Many {{people that were}} watching television or listening to radio reported <b>barely</b> <b>hearing</b> the audio, not seeing the video, hearing overlapping audio, or on cable and satellite systems which redirect to one certain channel slot to launch the test, were stuck on the EAS channel without routing to the test (such as a non-essential shopping channel, TV Guide Network, a Music Choice audio channel, or in DirecTV's case, a Sonic Tap audio channel airing Lady Gaga's [...] "Paparazzi" [...] at the time).|$|R
50|$|To his horror, he {{is brought}} {{against his will}} onto the small, barely {{seaworthy}} craft Lady Jane of Commander Harold and taken across the English Channel to help evacuate the soldiers from the beach at Dunkirk. When they arrive at the mole there, soldiers begin scrambling onto the boat, but Michael must dive underwater to free the propeller from a corpse which has become entangled with it. Michael frees the boat and joins the evacuees on the deck, which is too crowded for movement, and the Commander guides the boat back to England. During the trip, Michael goes into shock and <b>barely</b> <b>hears</b> a rescued soldier, Private Hardy, thanking him for saving his life. When they return, Michael finds his right foot has been mangled. (He will limp {{for the rest of}} his life.) He awakes in Orpington War Emergency Hospital, where he is adored as a hero, but, for months, he is terrified that he has changed the course of history by saving soldiers.|$|R
500|$|Producer Oren Koules told horror news website ShockTilYouDrop.com {{that there}} are eleven traps in the film, the most ever in the franchise. [...] There is one [...] "trap" [...] scene in the film that {{producers}} would not allow in previous Saw films that they described as [...] "too violent", [...] "too disgusting", and [...] "just wrong". [...] Melton later confirmed that was the [...] "Garage Trap", which involved a car and sets off a [...] "chain reaction" [...] with other characters. Gabby West {{was part of the}} trap. She told VH1, [...] "They molded my entire face, and basically my entire upper body after my belly button. They put layers and layers of different materials on you and you have two straws in your nose so you can breathe. It was so scary! They put so much of it on, you can't see and they put it in your ears so you can <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> anything. That was part of the prep for the film, which was really cool, to have a dummy made of yourself. But scary." [...] Over 25 gallons of fake blood was used in the film, which was two and half times more than Saw II.|$|E
2500|$|Superficial {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} most music critics. Pittnews commented that it [...] "is {{chock full of}} poorly produced, synthesized, and — worst of all — instantly forgettable tracks that are mildly irritating at best, but are usually insufferable." [...] TheChannels said [...] "The lyrics are {{no better than the}} rest of the album. Montag sings about these ideas: how hard it is to handle the paparazzi, how she turns heads everywhere she goes, and how she ignores those that rain on her parade." [...] Limelife gave the album a mixed review, calling some of the songs [...] "catchy", but also said the album [...] "sounds so manufactured, I have no idea what Heidi would sound like without all this technology behind her." [...] HollywoodLife was also gave the album a mixed review, writing [...] "Superficial is just as over-produced as you'd expect a Heidi album to be. In fact, there are some points when you can <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> Heidi's breathy words over busy beats and sporadic whooshing sounds." [...] They did, however, praise the songs [...] "My Parade" [...] and [...] "I'll Do It". Superficial did receive some positive reviews, however, most notably from the LGBT community. Homorazzi gave the album a positive review, and cited songs [...] "Fanatic", [...] "Superficial", and [...] "More Is More" [...] as highlights of the album. MuuMuse also praised the album, calling it [...] "fun", while calling several of the songs [...] "guilty pleasures." ...|$|E

50|$|If ever John Donne {{had in mind}} some {{specific}} “emergent occasion” then this was probably {{the last thing he}} would have thought of: two men, each waiting for their own particular “bell to toll”, each “an island, entire of itself” shouting across the strait to another man on another island <b>barely</b> able to <b>hear</b> a word the other is saying.|$|R
60|$|She {{went down}} {{the steps of the}} piazza, and Mr. Tippengray, having {{apparently}} lost the power of making up his mind what he should do, did what she wanted him to do, and followed her. They did not walk very far, but stood <b>barely</b> out of <b>hearing</b> of the persons on the piazza; her eyes sparkling up into his face, as his helpful words took root in her understanding.|$|R
50|$|Kyung-chul goes to {{the home}} of his friend Tae-joo, a cannibalistic murderer. After {{explaining}} his situation, Tae-joo remarks that whoever is after him must have some relation to one of his victims. Soo-hyun arrives, proceeding to incapacitate both murderers along with Tae-joo's girlfriend Se-jung. The next day, both Tae-joo and Se-jung are found by the police and sent to a hospital. A trusted subordinate of Soo-hyun's ensures he and Kyung-chul are sent to a private medical area away from the police. The <b>barely</b> conscious Kyung-chul <b>hears</b> them talk about the transmitter inside him.|$|R

50|$|The {{illness of}} Kiyomori’s {{pregnant}} daughter (Kenreimon’in) {{is attributed to}} angry spirits of the executed (Narichika) and the exiled. Kiyomori, interested in becoming a grandfather of the Imperial prince, agrees to a general amnesty. Naritsune (Narichika’s son) and Yasuyori are pardoned, but Shunkan is left alone on the Kikai-ga-shima island for letting the anti-Taira conspirators gather at his villa. A famous tragic scene follows when Shunkan beats {{his feet on the}} ground in despair. Kiyomori’s daughter gives birth to the future Emperor Antoku (1178). A loyal youth in service of Shunkan, Ariō, journeys to the island finding Shunkan <b>barely</b> alive. <b>Hearing</b> the news of his family’s death, Shunkan kills himself by fasting (1179). His suffering as well as the whirlwind that strikes the capital are seen as signs of the fall of the Taira. Kiyomori’s virtuous son, Shigemori, goes on a pilgrimage to Kumano and asks the gods for a quick death if the Taira are to fall. In a short while he falls ill and dies. Without Shigemori’s restraining influence, Kiyomori is close to open war with Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa. He leads soldiers to Kyoto where he exiles or dismisses 43 top court officials (including Regent Fujiwara no Motofusa). Next, Kiyomori imprisons Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa in the desolate Seinan palace (1179).|$|R
5000|$|His {{last two}} birthdays were media {{events in the}} town of Isabela. Civic leaders and {{veterans}} commended Mercado on his endurance and lucid mind, but the [...] "gift" [...] he would enjoy the most was the visit of Puerto Rican vedette and media icon Iris Chacón. In an interview, Mercado claimed to be a great fan of the artist, and particularly of her derrière ("That rump was something serious!", he was quoted as saying). Chacón visited Mercado, who, although he could <b>barely</b> see or <b>hear</b> by the time of his 114th birthday, was pleased with her visit. His photo touching Chacón's rear end, with a big smile on his face, made newspaper headlines in Puerto Rico. She returned the following year to greet him. After hearing news of Mercado's death, Chacón was quoted as saying: [...] "I feel like I've lost my own grandfather. I was blessed for knowing him, knowing that I made him happy, and blessed for the anecdotes and wishes he told me the times I met him. His wisdom is something I learned a lot from. His life {{is an example of how}} you're supposed to live your life, happily and doing good, for it will give you longevity and goodwill from everyone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{you please}} say," [...] she went on, [...] "that I am {{only to be}} taken on trial, at first? I am not to be engaged for more"--her voice sunk lower and lower, so that I could <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> the next words--"for more than three months, certain." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{abruptly}} {{left the}} table, {{and went to}} the window. When her back was turned to Rufus, she spoke. [...] "Am I a disgrace to him?" [...] she asked, in tones so faint that he could <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> them. [...] "I have had my fears of it, before now." ...|$|E
60|$|I could <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> the words: {{even his}} {{strength}} to whisper {{seemed to be}} fast leaving him. He kissed his son--with a panting fatigue under that trifling exertion, pitiable to see. As I placed the boy on his feet again, {{he looked up at}} his dying father, with the one idea still in his mind.|$|E
6000|$|He.--Think so! A sorry wretch like me! At {{night when}} I get back [...] to my garret, and burrow in my truckle-bed, I shrink up under my [...] blanket, my chest is all compressed, and I can hardly breathe; it [...] {{seems like a}} moan that you can <b>barely</b> <b>hear.</b> Now a banker makes the [...] room ring and astonishes a whole street. But what afflicts me [...] to-day, is not that I snore and sleep meanly and shabbily, like a [...] paltry outcast.|$|E
6000|$|... "Prince, {{they seem}} to be holy words to which I have little right to hearken. The priestess sings an ancient hallowed chant of life and death, and she prays that the goddess may touch her soul with the wing of fire and make her great and give her vision of things that have been and that shall be. More I dare not tell you now; indeed I can <b>barely</b> <b>hear,</b> and the song is hard to understand. Crouch down, for the moon rises, and pray that the mules may not stir. Presently she will go, and we can fly the holy place." ...|$|E
60|$|Something {{was wrong}} in my call; the birds were suspicious, knowing not what danger had kept their fellows silent so long, and now {{threatened}} {{them out of the}} black alders. A moment's intent listening; then the leader stepped slowly down from his log and came towards me cautiously, halting, hiding, listening, gliding, swinging far out to one side and back again in stealthy advance, till he drew himself up abruptly at sight of my face peering out of the underbrush. For a long two minutes he never stirred so much as an eyelid. Then he glided swiftly back, with a faint, puzzled, questioning kwit-kwit? to where his flock were waiting. A low signal that I could <b>barely</b> <b>hear,</b> a swift movement--then the flock thundered away in scattered flight into the silent, friendly woods.|$|E
6000|$|I {{set down}} again, a-shaking all over, {{and got out}} my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees --something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I could just <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> a [...] "me-yow! me-yow!" [...] down there. That was good! Says I, [...] "me-yow! me-yow!" [...] as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and {{scrambled}} {{out of the window}} on to the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.|$|E
6000|$|Speaking these words, {{always with}} the same calmness which had marked his manner from the first, he looked fixedly {{at her for a}} little while, sighed again, and turned away. Just before he {{disappeared}} among the trees, he said [...] "Farewell," [...] but so softly that she could <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> it. Some strange confusion clouded her mind as she lost sight of him. Had she injured him, or had he injured her? His words bewildered and oppressed her simple heart. Vague doubts and fears, and a sudden antipathy to remaining any longer near the summer-house, overcame her. She started to her feet, and, keeping the dog still at her side, hurried from the garden to the highroad. There, the wide glow of sunshine, the sight of the city lying before her, changed the current of her thoughts, and directed them all to Fabio and to the future.|$|E
6000|$|He {{took her}} hand. The clammy coldness of his grasp startled her. [...] "Do you still wonder why I {{followed}} you?" [...] he asked. The words were so faintly uttered {{that she could}} <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> them. Heavy drops of perspiration stood on his forehead; his face faded to a gray and ghastly whiteness--he staggered, and tried desperately to catch at the branch of a tree near them. She threw her arms round him. With all her little strength she tried to hold him up. Her utmost effort only availed to drag him to the grass plot by their side, and to soften his fall. Even as the cry for help passed her lips, she saw help coming. A tall man was approaching her--not running, even when he saw what had happened; only stalking with long strides. He was followed {{by one of the}} keepers of the gardens. Doctor Benjulia had his sick monkey to take care of. He kept the creature sheltered under his long frock-coat.|$|E
60|$|Our night, {{as often}} happens in the Tropics, was not {{altogether}} undisturbed; for, shortly after I had become unconscious of the chorus of toads and cicadas, my hammock came down by the head. Then I was woke by a sudden bark close outside, exactly {{like that of a}} clicketting fox; but as the dogs did not reply or give chase, I presumed it to be the cry of a bird, possibly a little owl. Next there rushed down the mountain a storm of wind and rain, which made the coco-leaves flap and creak, and rattle against the gable of the house; and set every door and window banging, till they were caught and brought to reason. And between the howls of the wind I became aware of a strange noise from seaward--a booming, or rather humming most like that which a locomotive sometimes makes when blowing off steam. It was faint and distant, but deep and strong enough to set one guessing its cause. The sea beating into caves seemed, at first, the simplest answer. But the water was so still on our side of the island, that I could <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> the lap of the ripple on the shingle twenty yards off; and the nearest surf was a mile or two away, over a mountain a thousand feet high. So puzzling vainly, I fell asleep, to awake, in the gray dawn, to the prettiest idyllic picture, through the half-open door, of two kids dancing on a stone {{at the foot of a}} coconut tree, with a background of sea and dark rocks.|$|E

50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the nineties he was already completely blind and walking with difficulty (as a result of an accident he had in Rio de Janeiro in 1973). He could <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> as well, but still had his incredible power of memory and his sharp thinking.|$|E
50|$|In one episode, {{when the}} Cone of Silence is not working, Max insists on using the Closet of Silence. In the Closet, {{there are so}} many coats and jackets, they can <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> each other, and cannot get out of the Closet, so Max shoots the lock off, {{injuring}} Larabee in the process.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007 he {{recorded}} {{a version of}} Hammerfall's [...] "The Fire Burns Forever", notable for his mic being down so low you can <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> him.

50|$|During shooting, Williams {{broke her}} left eardrum, {{which had already}} been broken in five other films. She was fitted with a {{prosthesis}} from latex that covered her nose and ears that prevented water from rushing in.

[...] Due to a lack of funds to both press the album and print a jacket, a thousand copies of the LP were packaged in white plastic trash bags with Xeroxed cover art glued to each bag.|$|E
