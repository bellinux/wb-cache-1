40|$|In this paper, {{to improve}} the {{retrieval}} effectiveness of a content-based image retrieval system, a shape-based object matching method is presented.

Each low-level node refines {{the shape of the}} parent node. Most of the noise disturbances are limited to the <b>bottom</b> <b>levels.</b> The effect of boundary noise is reduced by decreasing weights on the <b>bottom</b> <b>levels.</b> To compute the similarity of two skeleton structures, we consider the best match of spine nodes, nodes in level one of the structure.

40|$|Abstract We {{discuss the}} {{squeezing}} and statistical {{properties of the}} light produced by a coherently driven degenerate three-level laser with a parametric amplifier. We consider the {{case in which the}} atoms injected into the cavity are prepared in a coherent superposition of the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>levels</b> and with these levels coupled by the pump mode emerging from the parametric amplifier. It so happens that the presence of the parametric amplifier increases the squeezing and the mean photon number significantly. Furthermore, it is found that the maximum interacavity squeezing is 93 % {{in the presence of the}} coupling and when the superposition has no contribution (η = 0). On the other hand, the maximum interacavity squeezing turns out to be 94 % in the absence of the coupling. This squeezing is due to the parametric amplifier and the superposition. In addition, our calculation shows that one effect of coupling the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>levels</b> is to decrease the mean and the normally-ordered variance of the photon number.

25|$|The {{efficiency}} of the gastraphetes was improved by introducing the ballista. Its application in sieges and against rigid infantry formations featured more and more powerful projectiles, leading to technical improvements and larger ballistae. The smaller sniper version was often called Scorpio. An example {{for the importance of}} ballistae in Hellenistic warfare is the Helepolis, a siege tower employed by Demetrius during the siege of Rhodes in 305 BC. At each level of the moveable tower were several ballistae. The large ballistae at the <b>bottom</b> <b>level</b> were designed to destroy the parapet and clear it of any hostile troop concentrations while the small armorbreaking scorpios at the top level sniped at the besieged. This suppressive shooting would allow them to mount the wall with ladders more safely.|$|E
25|$|The four {{remaining}} teams {{stood on}} the topmost of the four levels of the Steps of Knowledge. Olmec began the round by telling the remaining teams the episode's legend of the featured artifact, which became the theme {{for the remainder of}} the episode. The legend centered on an artifact which the winning team searched for in the final round. At the end of the legend, Olmec told the teams the room in which the artifact could be found. After finishing, he asked the teams a series of questions to test their memory. Each multiple-choice question had three possible answers. A team attempting to answer signaled by stomping on a button on their step, causing the front of the step to illuminate (if Olmec was still in the middle of asking a question, he stopped talking immediately). A team who answered correctly moved down to the next level. If a team answered incorrectly or ran out of time (three seconds after being called upon), the other teams were given a chance to answer. The first two teams to answer three questions correctly and thereby reach the <b>bottom</b> <b>level</b> advanced to the next round.|$|E
25|$|The EGC is {{composed}} of a mixture of three distinct water masses. The water masses are Polar Water, Atlantic Water, and Deep Water. These water masses can be clearly seen throughout the EGC's tract southward, however, the upper layer water masses do change some due to atmospheric interaction along with inflow from other water sources in the Nordic Seas. The top 150 meters of the EGC is considered polar water and it is cold and low in salinity. The lowness in salinity {{has a lot to}} do with freshwater run off from sea ice melting, river runoff, and Pacific water flux and it is cold due to air-sea interactions while in the Arctic. Typical characteristics for the EGC Polar water are a temperature between 0°C and –1.7°C (e.g. freezing point of low-salinity sea water), and the salinity varies greatly from 30 psu (near the surface) to 34 psu at a 150-meter depth. The layer beneath the Polar Water is known as the Atlantic Water layer. It extends down to about 1000 m. This layer is defined as having relatively warm temperatures and saline waters. The temperatures are normally above 0°C and have a salinity of 34 psu at 150 meters and it increases to about 35 psu at 1000 meters. The Atlantic water that is seen in the EGC comes from two different sources. The first source of Atlantic Water originates from westward directed Atlantic water in the West Spitsbergen Current. This current sends Atlantic water (AW) into the Fram Strait, and because it is more dense then the surface Polar water it sinks to an intermediate depth. The second source of AW in the EGC originates from recirculated AW in the Arctic. This is AW that has entered the Arctic via the North Atlantic and has been circulating in the Arctic and is now being pushed out of the Arctic via the EGC. The layer beneath the Atlantic Water is simply referred to as the Deep Water where the salinity and temperatures are relatively constant. This level typically extends from 1000 meters to the bottom of the ocean. The temperatures in this <b>bottom</b> <b>level</b> are normally below 0°C and the salinity is around 34.9 psu.|$|E
