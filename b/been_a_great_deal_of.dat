5|$|Possession {{and use of}} {{psilocybin}} mushrooms, {{including the}} bluing species of Psilocybe, is therefore prohibited by extension. However, in many national, state, and provincial drug laws, there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity about {{the legal status of}} psilocybin mushrooms, as well as a strong element of selective enforcement in some places. Most US state courts have considered the mushroom a 'container' of the illicit drugs, and therefore illegal. A loophole further complicates the legal situation—the spores of psilocybin mushrooms do not contain the drugs, and are legal to possess in many areas. Jurisdictions that have specifically enacted or amended laws to criminalize the possession of psilocybin mushroom spores include Germany (since 1998), and California, Georgia, and Idaho in the United States. As a consequence, there is an active underground economy involved in the sale of spores and cultivation materials, and an internet-based social network to support the illicit activity.|$|E

25|$|The Renaissance saw {{significant}} {{advances in}} anatomy and surgical technique. However, {{despite all this}} progress, surgery remained a treatment of last resort. Largely because of the associated pain, many patients with surgical disorders chose certain death rather than undergo surgery. Although there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> debate as to who deserves the most credit for the discovery of general anesthesia, it is generally agreed that certain scientific discoveries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were critical to the eventual introduction and development of modern anesthetic techniques.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} blitzkrieg {{are in some}} doubt: if it existed, who contributed to it, whether {{it was part of}} German war {{strategy}} from 1933–1939. There has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> debate about whether it existed as a coherent military strategy. Many historians now think that blitzkrieg was not a military theory and the campaigns conducted by the Germans from 1939 to circa 1942 (with the exception of Operation Barbarossa) were improvised, rather than being based on a particular military strategy. Blitzkrieg had been called a Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) but many writers and historians have concluded that the Germans did not invent a new form of warfare but applied new technologies to traditional ideas of Bewegungskrieg (manoeuvre warfare) to achieve decisive victory.|$|E
25|$|The recent New Perspective on Paul {{has added}} {{significant}} support to a moral influence {{view of the}} atonement by reinterpreting many passages previously used against it. Some scholars now believe that Paul's teachings against works of the law referred only to ritualistic customs such as circumcision and dietary rules, not to moral good works in general. There has likewise <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> discussion about what Paul means by 'faith', {{and in particular the}} view that the Greek word concerned generally meant 'faithfulness' is receiving widespread support. Moral influence adherents have pointed out that Paul's statements about salvation (i.e. moral change) through faith (i.e. faithfulness to Christ's teachings) are therefore not in conflict with a moral influence view, and instead support such a view.|$|E

25|$|On 28 June Clausel reached Tudela {{and picked}} up its {{garrison}} before heading southeast along the Ebro River. By 30 June his column was at Zaragoza where Clausel gave his soldiers three days of rest. Then the column headed north to Jaca which was reached on 6 July. Clausel crossed the Pyrenees by the Somport (Canfranc) Pass on 12 July with 11,000 infantry, 500 cavalry and six mountain guns. Approximately 1,500 men became sick or could not keep up and became Mina's prisoners. After turning Cole's column east, Wellington abandoned his effort to cut off Clausel on 29 June. The Allied soldiers regarded the chase after Clausel to be a fool's errand and there had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> straggling.|$|E
25|$|Several {{evolutionary}} {{groups are}} still recognizable. However, combining {{the available evidence}} suggests that there has also <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> convergent evolution; for example the cliff shags are a convergent paraphyletic group. The proposed division into Phalacrocorax sensu stricto (or subfamily Phalacrocoracinae) cormorants and Leucocarbo sensu lato (or Leucocarboninae) shags does indeed have some degree of merit. The resolution provided by the mtDNA 12S rRNA and ATPase subunits six and eight sequence data {{is not sufficient to}} properly resolve several groups to satisfaction; in addition, many species remain unsampled, the fossil record has not been integrated in the data, and the effects of hybridisation – known in some Pacific species especially – on the DNA sequence data are unstudied.|$|E
25|$|Short-term {{regulation}} of HMG-CoA reductase {{is achieved by}} inhibition by phosphorylation (of Serine 872, in humans). Decades ago {{it was believed that}} a cascade of enzymes controls the activity of HMG-CoA reductase: an HMG-CoA reductase kinase was thought to inactivate the enzyme, and the kinase in turn was held to be activated via phosphorylation by HMG-CoA reductase kinase kinase. An excellent review on {{regulation of}} the mevalonate pathway by Nobel Laureates Joseph Goldstein and Michael Brown adds specifics: HMG-CoA reductase is phosphorylated and inactivated by an AMP-activated protein kinase, which also phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid biosynthesis. Thus, both pathways utilizing acetyl-CoA for lipid synthesis are inactivated when energy charge is low in the cell, and concentrations of AMP rise. There has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> research on the identity of upstream kinases that phosphorylate and activate the AMP-activated protein kinase.|$|E

25|$|Heavy {{industry}} {{is now part}} of Todmorden's history, not its present. The industrial chimneys have largely gone and the remaining mills have mostly been converted for other purposes. The town's industrial base is much reduced (at one time Todmorden had the largest weaving shed in the world). There has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> regeneration activity and Todmorden is now increasingly a commuter town for people working in Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Huddersfield and smaller towns. Todmorden also services the local rural area and attracts visitors through its market (indoor and outdoor), various events, heritage and the local Pennine countryside. Changing work patterns may have influenced the fact that the town was the first rural telephone exchange in Britain to be broadband-enabled through public demand. Rising house prices over recent years are a particular problem as there is limited land available in the valley for building affordable housing. It has for centuries been considered the safest accessible route directly across the Pennines.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the central}} tenet of {{maternal}} deprivation theory—that children's experiences of interpersonal relationships {{are crucial to}} their psychological development and that {{the formation of an}} ongoing relationship with the child is as important a part of parenting as the provision of experiences, discipline and child care—has become generally accepted, [...] "maternal deprivation" [...] as a discrete syndrome is not a concept that is much in current use other than in relation to severe deprivation as in [...] "failure to thrive". In the area of early relationships it has largely been superseded by attachment theory and other theories relating to even earlier infant–parent interactions. As a concept, parental deficiencies are seen as a vulnerability factor for, rather than a direct cause of, later difficulties. In relation to institutional care there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> subsequent research on the individual elements of privation, deprivation, understimulation and deficiencies that may arise from institutional care.|$|E
