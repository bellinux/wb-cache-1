5|$|By {{the mid-1980s}} heavy metal had {{branched}} {{in so many}} different directions that fans, record companies, and fanzines created numerous subgenres. The United States was especially known for one of these subgenres, thrash metal, which was innovated by <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> Anthrax, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Testament, Exodus, Nuclear Assault, Death Angel, Mono Men, The DT's, OFF!, and Overkill, with Metallica being the most commercially successful. The United States was {{known as one of the}} birthplaces of Death Metal during the mid to late 1980s. The Florida scene was the most well-known, featuring <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> Death, Morbid Angel, Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, Malevolent Creation, Obituary, and many others. There are now countless death metal and deathgrind bands across the country.|$|E
5|$|Straight edge <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> Minor Threat, Boston's SS Decontrol, and Reno, Nevada's 7 Seconds {{rejected}} the self-destructive lifestyles {{of many of}} their peers, and built a movement based on positivity and abstinence from cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, and casual sex.|$|E
5|$|The {{counterculture}} was a youth {{movement that}} included political activism, especially {{in opposition to}} the Vietnam War, and the promotion of various hippie ideals. The hippies were associated primarily with two kinds of music: the folk-rock and country rock of people like Bob Dylan and Gram Parsons, and the psychedelic rock of <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> Jefferson Airplane and The Doors. This movement was very closely connected to the British Invasion, a wave of bands from the United Kingdom who became popular throughout much of the 1960s. The British Invasion initially included <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and The Zombies who were later joined by <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> the Moody Blues and The Who. The sound of these bands was hard-edged rock, with the Beatles originally known for songs that resembled classic black rock songs by Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Smokey Robinson, The Shirelles and the Isley Brothers. Later, as the counterculture developed, The Beatles began using more advanced techniques and unusual instruments, such as the sitar, as well as more original lyrics.|$|E

5|$|The early 1970s saw {{a wave of}} singer-songwriters {{who drew}} on the introspective, deeply {{emotional}} and personal lyrics of 1960s folk-rock. They included James Taylor, Carole King and others, all known just as much for their lyric ability as for their performances. The same period saw the rise of bluesy Southern rock and country rock groups like the Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd. In the 1970s, soft rock developed, a kind of simple, unobtrusive and mellow form of pop-rock, exemplified {{by a number of}} <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> America and Bread, most of whom are little remembered today; many were one-hit wonders. In addition, harder arena rock <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> Chicago and Styx also saw some major success.|$|E
5|$|Zouk has diversified into {{multiple}} subgenres. These include zouk-love, pop ballads {{by artists}} like Edith Lefel and Gilles Floro, Zouk-R, and ragga-zouk <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> Lord Kossity who fused the genre with other influences.|$|E
5|$|An epic {{atmosphere}} {{is characteristic of}} some folk metal <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> Primordial, Moonsorrow, Turisas and the music project Folkearth. Groups like Ensiferum and Wintersun {{are known to have}} a melodious side while bands that favor a more blistering or brutal approach can be found in groups like Finntroll and Månegarm.|$|E

5|$|As further {{evidence}} of her influence on the heavy metal scene, in December 2008 Pure Steel Records released Tribute to Steel: A Tribute to Warlock, the first official tribute album to Warlock and Doro; the album includes contributions from <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> Custard, Crystal Viper, Sabaton and Lonewolf, paying homage to the songs of Doro's first four albums with the participation of Warlock's original members.|$|E
5|$|Dominican {{popular music}} history {{can be traced}} back to the 1940s and '50s, when dance <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> the Casimir Brothers and, later, The Swinging Stars, became famous across the island. Their music was a dance-oriented version of many kinds of Caribbean and Latin popular music, such as Cuban bolero, Brazilian samba, the merengue from the Dominican Republic, Trinidadian calypso, and American funk.|$|E
5|$|Hardcore, punk, and garage rock {{were the}} roots of {{alternative}} rock, a diverse grouping of rock subgenres that were explicitly opposed to mainstream music, and that arose from the punk and post-punk styles. In the United States, many cities developed local alternative rock scenes, including Minneapolis and Seattle. Seattle's local scene produced grunge music, a dark and brooding style inspired by hardcore, psychedelia, and alternative rock. With {{the addition of a}} more melodic element to the sound of <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains, grunge became wildly popular across the United States in 1991. Three years later, <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> Green Day, The Offspring, Rancid, Bad Religion, and NOFX hit the mainstream (with their respective then-new albums Dookie, Smash, Let's Go, Stranger than Fiction and Punk in Drublic) and brought the California punk scene exposure worldwide.|$|E

As an adolescent, {{he began by}} focusing upon Hendrix, as well as <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> Public Image Ltd., The Smiths, and XTC. Frusciante's other major influence was John McGeoch of Magazine and Siouxsie and the Banshees.|$|E
5|$|Punk {{emerged in}} South Africa as direct {{opposition}} to the conservative apartheid government and racial segregation enforcement of the time. <b>Bands</b> <b>like</b> Wild Youth and National Wake {{led the way in}} the late 1970s and early 1980s, followed by Powerage and Screaming Foetus from Durban and Toxik Sox in Johannesburg in the mid 1980s.|$|E
5|$|When Deep Purple's first line-up came {{together}} in 1967, {{there was a moment}} of transition for the British music scene. Beat was still popular, especially in dance halls and outside the capital, but the tastes of young people buying records and filling up the clubs was rapidly changing in favour of blues rock, progressive rock and psychedelic rock. New <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> The Moody Blues, Procol Harum, and The Nice were pioneers in combining classical music with rock, using complex and daring arrangements. At the same time, psychedelia was making strides in the hedonistic swinging London society, where <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> Pink Floyd, The Pretty Things, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Traffic and Cream experimented with different forms of drug-induced rock music, in line with the hippie subculture coming from the USA. Many well-known acts, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who, were influenced by the changing feel and added many elements of progressive and psychedelic rock to their albums of that period.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide range}} of foreign music styles have been popularized in Madagascar, {{including}} French chanson performed by artists such as Poopy, reggae, gospel music, and pop rock performed by bands such as Green and AmbondronA. Jazz has been popularized by artists such as Nicolas Vatomanga. Malagasy hip hop broke into the mainstream in the mid-nineties and has since skyrocketed to popularity through artists such as Da Hopp and 18,3. More recently <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> Oladad are experimenting with the fusion of hip-hop and traditional Malagasy musical styles and instruments.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> Sarcofago {{had been}} donning corpsepaint, by 1990, Mayhem was {{regularly}} wearing corpsepaint; many other black metal acts also adopted the look. Bathory inspired the Viking metal and folk metal movements and Immortal brought blast beats to the fore. Some bands in the Scandinavian black metal scene became associated with considerable {{violence in the}} early 1990s, with Mayhem and Burzum linked to church burnings. Growing commercial hype around death metal generated a backlash; beginning in Norway, much of the Scandinavian metal underground shifted to support a black metal scene that resisted being co-opted by the commercial metal industry.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1970s, Philly soul, funk, {{rock and}} most other genres were {{dominated}} by disco-inflected tracks. During this period, funk <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> The O'Jays and The Spinners continued to turn out hits. After the death of disco in 1980, soul music survived for a short time before going through yet another metamorphosis. With the introduction of influences from electro music and funk, soul music became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a genre of music that was again called R, usually distinguished from the earlier rhythm and blues by identifying it as contemporary R.|$|E

5|$|Closely {{related to}} power metal is {{progressive}} metal, which adopts the complex compositional approach of <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> Rush and King Crimson. This style {{emerged in the}} United States in the early and mid-1980s, with innovators such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning, and Dream Theater. The mix of the progressive and power metal sounds is typified by New Jersey's Symphony X, whose guitarist Michael Romeo {{is among the most}} recognized of latter-day shredders.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{alternative}} rock's declining popularity, {{some artists}} retained mainstream relevance. Post-grunge remained commercially viable into {{the start of}} the 21st century, when <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> Creed and Matchbox Twenty became among the most popular rock bands in the United States. At the same time Britpop began to decline, Radiohead achieved critical acclaim with its third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), which were in marked contrast with the traditionalism of Britpop. Radiohead, along with post-Britpop groups like Travis and Coldplay, were major forces in British rock in subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, many post-grunge bands {{adopted a}} hard rock sound {{and in the}} 2000s there came a renewed {{interest}} in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes. Out of this movement came garage rock <b>bands</b> <b>like</b> the White Stripes, the Strokes, Interpol and, later on, the Black Keys. In the 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.|$|E
5000|$|Dizzy Gillespie, in {{reflecting}} on the band in his 1979 autobiography To Be or Not to Bop, gives this perspective: [...] "There was no <b>band</b> that sounded <b>like</b> Billy Eckstine's. Our attack was strong, and we were playing bebop, the modern style. No other <b>band</b> <b>like</b> this one existed in the world." ...|$|R
