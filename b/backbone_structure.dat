It is a 1:1 {{racemate}} drug with a <b>backbone</b> <b>structure</b> of timoprazole, but substituted with two methoxy and two methyl groups.

25|$|The helical wheel {{represents}} a helix by {{a projection of}} the Cα <b>backbone</b> <b>structure</b> down the helix axis, while the wenxiang diagram represents it more abstractly as a smooth spiral coiled on {{the plane of the}} page. Both label the sequence with one-letter amino-acid code (see amino acid) at each Cα position, using different colors or symbols to code the amino-acid properties. Hydrophobic vs hydrophilic amino acids are always distinguished, as the most important property governing helix interactions. Sometimes positively vs negatively charged hydrophilics are distinguished, and sometimes ambiguous amino acids such as glycine (G) are distinguished. Color-coding conventions are various. The helical wheel does not change representation along the helix, while the wenxiang diagram is able to show the relative locations of the amino acids in an α-helix regardless of how long it is.|$|E
500|$|With Jay Ponder in 1987, {{as part of}} an {{exploration}} of using internal packing of sidechains to enumerate the possible sequences compatible with a given protein <b>backbone</b> <b>structure</b> (a foreshadowing of protein engineering and design), Richards developed the first side-chain rotamer library. (...) Increasingly detailed rotamer libraries have been made since then by other research groups, with some used primarily for structure validation and others for homology modeling or protein design.|$|E

2500|$|The rotameric {{states of}} side chains and their {{internal}} packing arrangement also present difficulties in homology modeling, even in targets {{for which the}} <b>backbone</b> <b>structure</b> {{is relatively easy to}} predict. This is partly {{due to the fact that}} many side chains in crystal structures are not in their [...] "optimal" [...] rotameric state as a result of energetic factors in the hydrophobic core and in the packing of the individual molecules in a protein crystal. One method of addressing this problem requires searching a rotameric library to identify locally low-energy combinations of packing states. It has been suggested that a major reason that homology modeling so difficult when target-template sequence identity lies below 30% is that such proteins have broadly similar folds but widely divergent side chain packing arrangements.|$|E
2500|$|... (+)-Discodermolide is a polyketide {{natural product}} found to {{stabilize}} microtubule. (+)-discodermolide was isolated by Gunasekera {{and his co-workers}} at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute from the deep-sea sponge Discodermia dissoluta in 1990. (+)-Discodermolide {{was found to be}} a potent inhibitor of tumor cell growth in several MDR cancer cell lines. [...] (+)-discodermolide also shows some unique characters, including a linear <b>backbone</b> <b>structure,</b> immunosuppressive properties both in vitro and in vivo, potent induction of an accelerated senescence phenotype, and synergistic antiproliferative activity in combination with paclitaxel. Discodermolide was {{recognized as one of the}} most potent natural promoters of tubulin assembly. A large number of efforts toward the total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide were directed by its interesting biological activities and extreme scarcity of natural sources (0.002% w/w from frozen marine sponge). The compound supply necessary for complete clinical trials cannot be met by harvesting, isolation, and purification. As of 2005, attempts at synthesis or semi-synthesis by fermentation have proven unsuccessful. As a result, all discodermolide used in preclinical studies and clinical trials has come from large-scale total synthesis.|$|E

40|$|How large is {{the volume}} of {{sequence}} space that is compatible with a given protein structure? Starting from random sequences, low free energy sequences were generated for 108 protein <b>backbone</b> <b>structures</b> by using a Monte Carlo optimization procedure and a free energy function based primarily on Lennard–Jones packing interactions and the Lazaridis–Karplus implicit solvation model. Remarkably, in the designed sequences 51 % of the core residues and 27 % of all residues were identical to the amino acids in the corresponding positions in the native sequences. The lowest free energy sequences obtained for ensembles of native-like <b>backbone</b> <b>structures</b> were also similar to the native sequence. Furthermore, both the individual residue frequencies and the covariances between pairs of positions observed in the very large SH 3 domain family were recapitulated in core sequences designed for SH 3 domain structures. Taken together, {{these results suggest that}} {{the volume of}} sequence space optimal for a protein structure is surprisingly restricted to a region around the native sequence...|$|R

However, this represents only one of three potential backbone configurations for phosphazenes. Linear polymers are formed either directly from phosphorus and nitrogen containing precursors or from the ring opening polymerization of hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene. Two other <b>backbone</b> <b>structures</b> can be formed from hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene cyclolinear and cyclomatrix. Cyclolinear are the least studied due to synthetic difficulty.

40|$|Oligosaccharide {{recognition}} by the 13 kDa soluble lectin from bovine heart muscle {{has been investigated}} by inhibition of binding of the 125 I-labelled lectin to trypsin-treated rabbit erythrocytes. The {{results indicate that the}} Type 1 (Gal beta 1 - 3 GlcNAc) and the Type 2 (Gal beta 1 - 4 GlcNAc) <b>backbone</b> <b>structures</b> are the basic recognition units, and that the blood-group-H structure, the blood-group-B structure, the 'B-like' structure [afucosyl-(blood group B) ] and the alpha 2 - 3 sialylated analogues of the <b>backbone</b> <b>structures</b> can also be accommodated and hence are candidate receptor structures for the lectin. A comparison of available inhibition data on six other soluble beta-galactoside-binding lectins (three from human lung and three from rat lung) has shown some common features among these and the bovine lectin, e. g. in general a stronger reaction with N-acetyl-lactosamine than with lactose, and a lack of reaction with 3 -fucosyl-lactose and 6 -sialyl-lactose. However, there are distinctive features among the lectins, e. g. differences in relative reactions with the blood-group-A structure, and no two of the lectins appear to be identical in their fine specificities...|$|R
40|$|The role of sialoglycolipids (gangliosides) as receptors for {{the human}} {{pathogen}} Mycoplasma pneumoniae was investigated by using purified gangliosides of known carbohydrate structures as inhibitors of the binding of 51 Cr-labeled erythrocytes to sheet cultures of M. pneumoniae. We found that sialoglycolipids with long carbohydrate backbones of the poly-N-acetyllactosamine type were more potent inhibitors of M. pneumoniae binding than those with short carbohydrate chains. This is in accord with earlier inhibition data for glycoproteins and oligosaccharides. Thus, the inhibitory activity of a fraction of bovine erythrocyte gangliosides containing long <b>backbone</b> <b>structures</b> of I antigen type was approximately 200 times {{greater than that of}} the short chain gangliosides GM 3 and GT 1 b. The binding of M. pneumoniae to erythrocytes of I and i antigen types was found to be comparable, indicating that M. pneumoniae in its adhesive specificity may not distinguish between the branched carbohydrate backbones of I type and the linear structures of i type. Thus, the production of autoantibodies to the <b>backbone</b> <b>structures</b> of I type rather than i type after infection with this agent may simply reflect a greater abundance of branched carbohydrate receptors of I type on the surface of host cells with which the mycoplasma forms immunogenic complexes...|$|R

40|$|Networks with a {{prescribed}} power-law scaling in {{the spectrum of}} the graph Laplacian can be generated by evolutionary optimization. The Laplacian spectrum encodes the dynamical behavior of many important processes. Here, the networks are evolved to exhibit subdiffusive dynamics.

Exploiting results from algebraic graph theory on symmetric networks, we find the underlying <b>backbone</b> <b>structures</b> and how they contribute to the spectrum. The resulting coarse-grained networks provide an intuitive view of how the anomalous diffusive properties can be realized in the evolved structures. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

Blood group A and the Type 1 based blood group ALeb and Lea antigens were detected as well as antigens associated with unsubstituted, monofucosylated and difucosylated Type 2 blood group chains. The Lea and the difucosylated Type 2 antigen activities were abolished by treating the blotted receptor with endo-beta-galactosidase, indicating that they are expressed on <b>backbone</b> <b>structures</b> of poly-lacto/neolacto type.

The glycosidic linkage of oligosaccharides to protein was investigated using Pronase digests of the receptor biosynthetically labelled with [3 H]glucosamine or [3 H]fucose. The oligosaccharides were alkali-resistant, consistent with N- rather than O-glycosidically linked chains. A proportion of [3 H]fucose-labelled glycopeptides was susceptible to endo-beta-galactosidase, confirming the immunoblotting experiment using antibodies against the Lea and the difucosylated Type 2 antigenic determinants. Oligosaccharides were released from the [3 H]fucose- and [3 H]-glucosamine-labelled glycopeptides by hydrazinolysis. Chromatography of the oligosaccharides on Bio-Gel P 6 and Concanavalin A columns indicated a spectrum of oligosaccharides which include those of high mannose type labelled with [3 H]glucosamine, and a mixture of oligosaccharides labelled with [3 H]fucose and [3 H]glucosamine of bi- and multiantennary complex types of which a subpopulation is susceptible to digestion with endo-beta-galactosidase...|$|R
