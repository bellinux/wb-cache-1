The welding group at SRTC {{is using the}} <b>burst</b> <b>test</b> to qualify this seal weld {{in lieu of the}} shear test in ASME B&PV Code, Section IX, paragraph QW- 196. The <b>burst</b> <b>test</b> is considered simpler and more appropriate than the shear test for this application. Although the geometry, loading and boundary conditions are quite different in the two tests, structural analyses show similarity in the failure mode of the shear test in paragraph QW- 196 and the <b>burst</b> <b>test</b> on the DWPF canister nozzle Non-linear structural analyses are performed using finite element techniques to study the failure mode of the two tests. Actual test geometry and realistic stress strain data for the 304 L stainless steel and the weld material are used in the analyses. The finite element models are loaded until failure strains are reached. The failure modes in both tests are shear at the failure points. Based on these observations, it is concluded that the use of a <b>burst</b> <b>test</b> in lieu of the shear test for qualifying the canister-plug weld is acceptable. The <b>burst</b> <b>test</b> analysis for the canister-plug also yields the burst pressures which compare favorably with the actual pressure found during <b>burst</b> <b>tests.</b> Thus, the analysis also provides an estimate of the safety margins in the design of these vessels...|$|R

This paper describes tests that have been performed to assess the effects of hypervelocity impact (HVI) damage on Titanium alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) pressure vessels burst pressure and characteristics. The tests consisted of a pair of HVI impact tests on water-filled Ti- 6 Al- 4 V tanks (water being used as a surrogate to the actual propellant) and subsequent <b>burst</b> <b>tests</b> as well as a <b>burst</b> <b>test</b> on an undamaged control tank.

40|$|The <b>burst</b> <b>test</b> is used {{to assess}} the {{material}} performance of tritium reservoirs in the surveillance program in which reservoirs have been in service for extended periods of time. A materials system model and finite element procedure were developed under a Savannah River Site Plant-Directed Research and Development (PDRD) program to predict the structural response under a full range of loading and aged material conditions of the reservoir. The results show that the predicted burst pressure and volume ductility are in good agreement with the actual <b>burst</b> <b>test</b> results for the unexposed units. The material tensile properties used in the calculations were obtained from a curved tensile specimen harvested from a companion reservoir by Electric Discharge Machining (EDM). In the absence of exposed and aged material tensile data, literature data were used for demonstrating the methodology in terms of the helium- 3 concentration in the metal and the depth of penetration in the reservoir sidewall. It can be shown that the volume ductility decreases significantly with the presence of tritium and its decay product, helium- 3, in the metal, as was observed in the laboratory-controlled <b>burst</b> <b>tests.</b> The model and analytical procedure provides a predictive tool for reservoir structural integrity under aging conditions.

40|$|Sine <b>burst</b> <b>tests</b> {{are often}} used for {{structural}} qualification of space flight hardware. In most instances, the driving frequency of the shaker is specified far below the structure's first resonant mode, such that the entire test article sees uniform acceleration. For large structures, this limits qualification testing to lower parts of the structure, or else it over-tests the lower structure to achieve qualification of the upper structure. The WindSat payload, a 10. 5 foot tall graphite/epoxy, titanium, and aluminum radiometer, experiences accelerations at the six foot diameter reflector nearly four times that at the spacecraft interface. Due to size of the payload, the number of bonded joints, and the lightweight reflector support structure design and construction, using static pull testing to qualify all of the bonded joints in the upper structure would result in large, expensive, and extensive <b>test</b> fixturing.
