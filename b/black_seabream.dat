40|$|Species {{and size}} {{selectivity}} {{of the deep}} water longline traditionally used in commercial fishing of the <b>black</b> spot <b>seabream</b> (Pagellus bogaraveo) were studied in the Strait of Gibraltar with four sizes of hooks. <b>Black</b> spot <b>seabream</b> contributed up to 88 % of the catch by number. Catch and by-catch rates differed for the different hooks and fishing trials. Significant differences in average fish length between all hooks, except in one case, were found. The comparison of two experimental fishing trials within 4 years indicates a displacement towards smaller sizes in the size frequency distributions. The {{results of this study}} show that the fishing gear can be size selective depending on hook size. The fitted selectivity models for each experiments were very different despite having two hooks in common. This is probably due to the very different catch size distributions in the two periods, which suggests that the population size structure changed significantly between 2000 / 2001 and 2004 / 2005...|$|R

We found that both THg and MeHg were dominantly bound with the cellular debris, followed by metallothionein-like protein > metal-rich granule > heat-denatured protein > organelles pools. In general, Hg bound with the metal-sensitive fraction was small, indicating that Hg may have little toxicity to the fish (muscle).

40|$|AbstractAntiquitin is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved protein {{believed to}} play a role in the regulation of cellular turgor. Based on sequence analysis, this protein is classified as a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily. All previous studies on antiquitin have been confined to the nucleotide level, and the protein has never been purified and characterized. In the present investigation, the antiquitin protein was purified for the first time. An acetaldehyde-oxidizing protein was isolated from the liver of <b>black</b> <b>seabream</b> (Mylio macrocephalus) by chromatographies on α-cyanocinnamate Sepharose and Affi-gel Blue agarose, followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The purified protein was identified as antiquitin by the first 18 N-terminal amino acid residues which showed 83. 3 % identity with the deduced sequence of human antiquitin. Electrophoretic mobility studies indicated that <b>black</b> <b>seabream</b> antiquitin is a tetramer with a subunit molecular mass of 57. 5 kDa. Kinetic analysis of the purified protein indicated that it catalyzes the oxidation of acetaldehyde with Km and Vmax values of 2. 0 mM and 1. 3 U/mg, respectively. The longer aliphatic propionaldehyde and the aromatic benzaldehyde are also substrates of the purified enzyme.

40|$|Age and {{the growth}} of the <b>black</b> <b>seabream</b> Spondyliosoma cantharus (Linnaeus, 1758) from the Gulf of Tunis were {{investigated}} using scales and otoliths. The length-weight relationship showed that the growth rates were isometric for females whereas males and the whole sample present a positive allometry. The monthly evolution in marginal increment data of scales and otoliths revealed that only one annulus is formed per year in April. Fish length and radii of the scales or otoliths were closely correlated. The von Bertalanffy growth equation was fitted on mean back-calculated length-at-age data, resulting in the parameter values L∞= 35. 4 cm, k= 0. 15 y– 1 and t 0 =– 0. 19 y for scales and L∞= 38. 6 cm, k= 0. 10 y– 1 and t 0 =– 0. 14 y for otoliths. Parameters estimated from scale and otoliths were significantly similar. However, taking into consideration the lower standard deviations of means for estimates based on otolith readings and the higher variance explained by the regression line fitted to otoliths, the latter seem to be more appropriate for ageing S. cantharus. The maximum age of the <b>black</b> <b>seabream</b> of the Gulf of Tunis is 10 years.

40|$|The {{action of}} a number of growth hormone secretagogues (GHS) on growth hormone (GH) {{secretion}} and gene expression was studied in a primary culture of pituitary cells isolated from the <b>black</b> <b>seabream</b> Acanthopagrus schlegeli. The peptide GHS employed included growth hormone-releasing peptide (GHRP) - 2, ipamorelin, and human ghrelin. The nonpeptide GHS employed included the benzolactam GHS L 692, 585 and the spiropiperidine GHS L 163, 540. Secreted GH was measured in the culture medium by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method using a specific antibody against seabream GH. The GH mRNA content in the incubated cells was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a pair of gene-specific primers designed from the cloned <b>black</b> <b>seabream</b> GH cDNA sequence. A dose-dependent stimulation of GH release was demonstrated by all the GHS tested, except human ghrelin, with EC 50 values in the nanomolar range. Simultaneous measurement of GH mRNA levels in the incubated seabream pituitary cells indicated that the GHS-stimulated increase in GH secretion was not paralleled by corresponding changes in GH gene expression. In contrast to the situation previously reported in the rat, no change in GH gene expression was noticed in the seabream pituitary cells even though the time of stimulation by GHS was increased up to 48 h, confirming that the GHS-stimulated GH secretion in seabream is independent of GH gene transcription. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

We have previously isolated two GHSR subtypes from the pituitary of the <b>black</b> <b>seabream</b> Acanthopagrus schlegeli. In the present study, we have cloned and characterized ghrelin from the same fish species at both the cDNA and gene levels. The full-length seabream ghrelin cDNA, isolated from seabream stomach using a novel approach by exploiting a single conserved region in the coding region, was found to encode a prepropeptide of 107 amino acids, with the predicted mature ghrelin peptide consisting of 20 amino acids (GSSFLSPSQKPQNRGKSSRV).

On the other hand, however, its exact physiological function in animals remains elusive. We herein report the isolation of the <b>black</b> <b>seabream</b> (Acanthopagrus schlegeli) antiquitin gene (sbALDH 7) and the functional characterization of its promoter region. The 1. 6 kb 5 ′-flanking region of sbALDH 7 exhibits an intense promoter activity (30 - 170 fold of the basal) in five mammalian and fish cell lines of different origins. Progressive 5 ′-deletion analysis suggests that the core promoter is located within the region - 297 /+ 41 whereas a cis-acting repressor of basal transcription is present in the region - 878 /- 297. In silico analysis of this sbALDH 7 promoter region does not reveal any osmotic response element.

40|$|Finally, the {{isolation}} and cloning of black sea bream SL receptor using PCR cloning and protein pull down assay were also attempted. Based on the PCR cloning results, the phylogenetic analysis of nonsalmonids fish GHR 1 and SLR protein sequence, the GHR 1 data of tissue distribution {{and effects of}} environmental salinity and fasting in tilapia, along {{with the results of}} far western blot, black sea bream GHR 1 is probably a receptor for SL, however there is also a SL specific receptor in black sea bream. In hormone treated primary cell culture of nonspawning black sea bream pituitary, 10 - 8 M E 2 significantly increases SL mRNA level but 10 - 10 M, 10 - 9 M, 10 - 8 M of E 2 inhibit GH mRNA level in female black seabream; 10 - 8 M E 2 also inhibits SL and GH mRNA expression in bisexual black sea bream; 10 - 8 M MT inhibits SL mRNA expression in male black sea bream but any concentration of MT detected shows no significant effect on GH mRNA level. Key words. somatolactin (SL), monthly changes, SL promoter, pit- 1 and SL receptorSomatolactin, SL, is a novel member of GH family of pituitary hormone only found in fish. It {{is considered to be a}} member of the GH gene family after gene duplication. Two types of SL, SL alpha and SL beta were identified, and SL 13 seems only in fresh water fish, such as goldfish, catfish, rainbow trout, eel and zebrafish. Black sea bream is a marine fish, and there is only SL alpha found from sequencing of over 100 SL cDNA clones. The cDNAs encoding for transcription factor pit- 1 variants were cloned and the transactivation of these Pit- 1 isoforms on SL gene promoter were studied. Three variants of Pit- 1 are first identified in fish. Pit- 1 b and Pit- 1 c can enhance SL promoter activity in Hepa-T 1 cells respectively to about 2 fold and 12 fold, but pit- 1 a failed to activate the SL gene it in the same cells. All the three pit- 1 s of black sea bream couldn't reverse the inhibition of SL promoter in GH 3 cells. The data suggest that N terminal 60 amino acid residues are critical in transactiation on SL promoter and SL promoter activity is possibly limited to fish SL secreting cells. The SL gene promoter was obtained for gene regulation studies aiming to search for possible regulatory elements controlling the transcription of SL gene in <b>black</b> <b>seabream.</b> SL gene promoter is active in HepaT 1 cells, but is inhibited in GH 3 cells. Seven putative pit- 1 response elements were confirmed with EMSA and super shift assay. To study the physiological function of SL in <b>black</b> <b>seabream,</b> we initiated a study of monthly expressions of SL mRNA and gonadal somatic index (GSI) to determine whether SL is related to reproduction in <b>black</b> <b>seabream,</b> with GH mRNA levels were also detected for comparison. The results imply that function of SL is possibly related to early development of testis, while GH probably plays some roles in testis and ovary maturation. by Tian, Jing. "October 2007.

Both PRLRs in teleosts (the classical one named as PRLR 1, the newly identified one as PRLR 2) resemble the long-form mammalian PRLRs. However, despite their overall structural similarities, the two PRLR subtypes in fish share very low amino acid similarities (about 30 %), mainly due to differences in the intracellular dimain. In particular, the Box 2 region and some intracellular tyrosine residues are missing in PRLR 2. Tissue distribution study by real-time PCR in <b>black</b> <b>seabream</b> (sb) revealed that both receptors (sbPRLR 1 and sbPRLR 2) are widely expressed in different tissues. In gill, the expression level of sbPRLR 2 is much higher than that of sbPRLR 1. In the intestine, the ession of sbPRLR 1 is higher than that of sbPRLR 2. The expression levels of both receptors are relatively low in most other tissues, with sbPRLR 1 generally higher than sbPRLR 2. The sbPRLR 1 and sbPRLR 2 were functionally expressed in cultured human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Both receptors can activate the β-casein and c-fos promoters; however, only sbPRLR 1 but not sbPRLR 2 can activate the Spi promother upon receptor stimulation in a ligand-specific manner. These results indicate that both receptors share some common functions but are distinctly different from each other in mobilizing post-receptor events. When challenged with different steroid hormones, the two PRLRs exhibited very different gene expression patterns in the seabream kidney. The sbPRLR 1 expression was up-regulated by estradiol and cortisol, whereas testosterone had no significant effect. For sbPRLR 2, its expression was down-regulated by estradiol and testosteroene, while cortisol exerted no significant effect. The 5 ′-flanking regions of the sbPRLR 1 amnd sbPRLR 2 genes were cloned and the promoter activities were studied in transfected GAKS cells in the absence or presence of different steroid hormones. The results of the promoter studies were in general agreement with the in vivo hormonal regulation of gene expression results. The sbPRLR 1 gene promoter activity was activatd by estradiol and cortisol, but not by testosterone. In contrast, the sbPRLR 2 gene promoter activity was inhibited by estradiol, cortisol, and testosterone. © 2007 Society for Endocrinology. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemistry}} of <b>black</b> <b>seabream</b> Spondyliosoma cantharus otoliths from three main fishery grounds (Olhao, Sagres and Sesimbra) located along c. 400 km of the Portuguese {{south and west}} coasts was examined. Element:Ca ratios were determined in whole otoliths and otolith cores of young adult specimens of 23 years of age. Using the data from whole otoliths, {{it was possible to}} discriminate among S. cantharus from the three fishing grounds with an average accuracy of 91 %. Differences among fishing grounds were significant for all element:Ca ratios, and otoliths from Sagres had significantly higher levels of all ratios compared to the other fishing grounds. In contrast, the chemical composition of the otolith core, representative of the larval stage, showed limited variation among the fishing grounds, with an average discrimination accuracy of only 44 %, although the Mg:Ca ratio of the otolith cores was also significantly higher for the Sagres samples. The data suggest that larval stages experienced a homogenous environment consistent with an offshore oceanic spawning. Juveniles appeared to display local residency on the inshore fishing grounds, areas probably characterized by greater environmental heterogeneity. Spondyliosoma cantharus population structure is consistent with distinct local population units that share a spawning ground providing recruits to different coastal fishery areas...|$|E
40|$|Antiquitin (ATQ) {{belongs to}} the {{superfamily}} of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). It is an evolutionarily conserved protein as shown from its high amino acid sequence identity between human and its plant counterparts. Therefore, ATQ is believed {{to play an important}} physiological role. Until now, however, studies on ATQ are limited and its cellular function is uncertain. Recently, we have first demonstrated the aldehyde oxidizing ability of ATQ purified from the liver of <b>black</b> <b>seabream</b> (Acanthopagrus schlegeli). To further investigate this protein, different attempts have been made. Recombinant ATQ has been successfully expressed in E. coli. Kinetics studies showed that it possessed similar characteristics with its native enzyme. The recombinant protein was produced in large amount for protein crystallization. Crystal of ATQ was obtained and its X-ray structure was solved to 2. 8 A in complex with NAD+. Tetrameric ATQ was a dimer of dimer. Three domains {{can be found in the}} subunit structure of ATQ, the NAD+-binding domain, catalytic domain and oligomerization domain. In each of the NAD+-binding domain, one molecule of NAD + could be found. The overall structure of ATQ was similar to other tetrameric ALDHs, but the coenzyme binding was in a single "hydride transfer" conformation and the density was well-defined which was contrast to most ALDH structures. Structural study of the substrate-binding pocket explained the failure of ATQ in oxidizing several aldehydes which is specific to certain members of ALDH. The ATQ full-length cDNA of <b>black</b> <b>seabream</b> was obtained. It consisted of 2309 by with a 153 nucleotide long 5 ' UTR, and a 209 nucleotide long 3 ' UTR. An ORF of 1533 by which encoded a protein with 511 amino acids was found. This putative protein showed the highest of 87 % sequence identity with zebrafish ATQ, and ∼ 60 % with plant ATQs. Tissue distribution was studied by RT-PCR. A high level of mRNA expression was observed in liver and kidney. Subcellular localization study using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein showed that ATQ was expressed in cytoplasm. However, another in-frame initiation methionine (M 1) was found 31 residues before this generally accepted methionine (M 2). Both iPSORT analysis and experimental studies using GFP fusion protein indicated that the 31 amino acid peptide contained a mitochondrial-targeting signal. Tang Wai Kwan. "July 2005.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that ghrelin stimulates growth hormone release from the pituitary via the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). We have previously isolated two GHSR subtypes from the pituitary of the <b>black</b> <b>seabream</b> Acanthopagrus schlegeli. In the present study, we have cloned and characterized ghrelin from the same fish species at both the cDNA and gene levels. The full-length seabream ghrelin cDNA, isolated from seabream stomach using a novel approach by exploiting a single conserved region in the coding region, was found to encode a prepropeptide of 107 amino acids, with the predicted mature ghrelin peptide consisting of 20 amino acids (GSSFLSPSQKPQNRGKSSRV). Embedded in this full-length cDNA is a putative fish orthologue of the recently reported mammalian obestatin peptide. The ghrelin gene in <b>black</b> <b>seabream,</b> obtained by genomic PCR, was found to encompass four exons and three introns, possessing the same structural organization as in tilapia and goldfish, but different from that in rainbow trout. In addition, a 2230 -bp 5 ′-flanking region of the seabream ghrelin gene was obtained by genome walking. Sequence analysis revealed that, {{as in the case of}} the human ghrelin gene, there is neither a GC box nor a CAAT box present in the isolated 5 ′-flanking region. However, a number of putative transcription factor-binding sites different from the human counterpart were found in the 5 ′-flanking region of the seabream ghrelin gene, suggesting that different cis- and trans-acting elements are involved in controlling their gene expression. Functional activity of this 5 ′-flanking region was examined by cloning it into the pGL 3 -Basic vector upstream of the luciferase reporter gene and transfected into various cell lines. Positive promoter activity could only be recorded in the colon-derived Caco- 2 cells, suggesting that the cloned 5 ′-flanking region represents the functional promoter of the seabream ghrelin gene, which exhibits tissue-specific promoter activity. Using reverse transcriptase PCR analysis, expression of ghrelin was detected only in the seabream stomach, but not in the other tissues examined, including the brain, gill, intestine, kidney, liver and spleen. This stomach-specific expression of ghrelin in seabream is subject to regulation, as administration of growth hormone or ipamorelin to the fish in vivo was demonstrated to enhance its expression. Reminiscent of the homologous upregulation found in the transcriptional control of the seabream GHSR gene, a similar homologous regulatory mechanism might also exist in controlling the expression of seabream ghrelin. The identification of both GHSR and ghrelin from a single fish species would facilitate our subsequent studies on the elucidation of the physiological functions of the ghrelin/GHSR, system in teleost.

40|$|An 8 -week {{feeding trial}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of dietary docosahexaenoic to eicosapentaenoic acid ratio (DHA/EPA) on growth performance, fatty acid profiles, anti- oxidant capacity, hematological characteristics and expression of some lipid metabolism related genes of juvenile <b>black</b> <b>seabream</b> (Acanthopagrus schlegelii) of initial weight 9. 47 ± 0. 03 g. Five isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets (45 % crude protein and 14 % crude lipid) were formulated to contain graded DHA/EPA ratios of 0. 65, 1. 16, 1. 60, 2. 03 and 2. 67. There were no differences in growth performance and feed utilization among treatments. Fish fed higher DHA/EPA ratios had higher malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in serum than lower ratios. Serum triacylglycerol (TAG) content was significantly higher in fish fed the lowest DHA/EPA ratio. Tissue fatty acid profiles reflected the diets despite down-regulation of LC- PUFA biosynthesis genes, fatty acyl desaturase 2 (fads 2) and elongase of very long-chain fatty acids 5 (elovl 5), by high DHA/EPA ratios. Expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (accα) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 A (cpt 1 a) were up-regulated by high DHA/EPA ratio, whereas sterol regulatory element-binding protein- 1 (srebp- 1) and hormone-sensitive lipase (hsl) were down-regulated. Fatty acid synthase (fas), 6 -phosphogluconate dehydro- genase (6 pgd) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (pparα) showed highest expression in fish fed intermediate (1. 16) DHA/EPA ratio. Overall, this study indicated that dietary DHA/EPA ratio affected fatty acid profiles and significantly influenced lipid metabo- lism including LC-PUFA biosynthesis and other anabolic and catabolic pathways, and also had impacts on antioxidant capacity and hematological characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Ghrelin, the {{recently}} discovered endogenous ligand for growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), is widely expressed {{and involved in}} regulating diverse physiological functions in addition to stimulation of growth hormone (GH) secretion. Previous studies have demonstrated the functional significance of the ghrelin/GHSR system, yet the transcriptional regulation of the ghrelin and GHSR genes are poorly understood. We have recently cloned the GHSR cDNA from the pituitary of <b>black</b> <b>seabream</b> Acanthopagrus schlegeli. In the present study, we have isolated a 2. 1 kb 5 ′-flanking region of the GHSR gene from the same species and have investigated, for the first time, the transcriptional regulation of GHSR from a non-human species. The 5 ′-flanking region of the seabream GHSR gene was found to contain a number of unique putative transcription factor-binding sites different from the human counterpart. Functional characterization of the 5 ′-flanking region in several cell lines indicates that the region between - 1423 and + 19 contains sufficient elements for promoter function. Moreover, progressive 3 ′-deletion analysis suggests the presence of negative regulatory element(s) and essential cis-acting element(s) at - 514 /+ 19 and - 928 /- 515, respectively. Furthermore, we {{have shown that the}} promoter activity is significantly enhanced by a GHSR agonist in a cell line stably expressing the seabream GHSR, and this stimulatory effect could be completely blocked by a GHSR antagonist. These results suggest that homologous up-regulation {{plays an important role in}} the transcriptional control of the teleostean GHSR gene. This is in big contrast to the human situation in which a homologous down-regulation of the GHSR gene transcription by its own ligand has been previously demonstrated. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Three {{different}} highly consumed {{fish species}} from Al-Ahsa market, Saudi Arabia namely Spangled emporer (Lethriuns nebulosus), Red striped seabream (Pagrus major) and <b>Black</b> <b>seabream</b> (Spondyliosoma cantharus) were evaluated for their muscle contents of heavy metals (e. g., Cd and Pb) and trace elements (e. g., Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn). The possible {{risks associated with}} their human consumption were also studied. A total of 60 fresh fish samples comprising of 20 samples from each above mentioned fish were collected, and were subjected for determination of heavy metal and trace element contents by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry after Microwave Wet Digestion. The results showed that, accumulation patterns of the heavy metals and trace elements followed the order: Fe > Zn > Cu > Mn > Pb > Cd. There were variations among metal contents in {{the muscles of the}} three fish species; S. cantharus accumulated the highest levels of Cu, Zn and Mn, while the highest level of Fe could be detected in the muscles of P. major. The concentration of Cd and Pb remained comparable in the muscles of all three fish species. The calculated maximum daily intake (MDI) values were found as 0. 0003, 0. 0009, 0. 0035, 0. 0001, 0. 0000, 0. 0000 mg/day/person for Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, Cd and Pb, respectively.

40|$|A {{full-length}} clone of {{the growth}} hormone receptor (GHR) was isolated from a cDNA library constructed from the liver of <b>black</b> <b>seabream</b> (Acanthopagrus schlegeli). The seabream GHR (sbGHR) cDNA sequence encodes a transmembrane protein of 640 amino acids (aa) possessing the characteristic motifs and architectural design of GHRs of other species. When {{compared to the other}} fish GHRs, it is most homologous to another marine fish species, the turbot, where the aa identity is 79. 3 %. But the sbGHR sequence is more remotely related to the goldfish GHR (51. 6 % aa identity) and the salmonid GHRs (∼ 46 - 48 % aa identities). Phylogenetic comparison with other known GHRs indicates that the fish GHRs constitute a distinct group among the different vertebrate classes. The aa identities between sbGHR and other GHRs are low, being around 40 % with mammalian GHRs, around 45 % with avian and reptilian GHRs, and less than 35 % with Xenopus GHR. CHO cells transfected with the sbGHR cDNA can be stimulated to proliferate by recombinant seabream growth hormone (sbGH). In addition, the transfected cells can transactivate a co-expressed mammalian serine protease inhibitor (Spi) 2. 1 promoter upon stimulation by sbGH. These functional assays indicated that the fish receptor can interact with its homologous ligand to evoke the downstream post-receptor events. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and genomic PCR using a pair of gene-specific primers revealed the expression of two alternatively spliced forms of sbGHR in various tissues of the fish. A 93 -bp intron, unique to the sbGHR gene and not found in any other known GHR genes, is alternatively spliced to give rise to two forms of receptor mRNA transcripts. The two forms of the receptor are differentially expressed among the different tissues of the fish. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The ELR + CXC chemokines are {{multifunctional}} mediators {{that are}} mainly {{responsible for the}} recruitment of leucocytes to sites of inflammation and infection. Because of their high sequence identity with mammalian IL- 8, fish IL- 8 -like CXCs have been named as piscine 'IL- 8 ' and included in the ELR + subgroup, {{even though there is}} no reliable functional or evolutionary evidence to support this classification. Results In this investigation, a homologue of piscine 'IL- 8 ' from <b>black</b> <b>seabream</b> (Acanthopagrus schlegeli), called BS CXC, has been cloned and analyzed. The results revealed that BS CXC has a high gene similarity and tertiary structure similarity with piscine and mammalian CXC chemokines, both ELR - CXC and ELR + CXC, although it has a lower identity with ELR - CXC, compared with ELR + CXC chemokines. Like other piscine IL- 8, BS CXC has only an incomplete ELR motif, which is essential for the mammalian ELR + CXC ability to attract granulocytes. Bioactivity assay demonstrated that the BS rCXC produced in E. coli significantly stimulated migration of fish neutrophils and macrophages, but had no effect on rat neutrophils and macrophages, whereas hrIL- 8 induced strong chemotaxis of fish neutrophils but did not affect fish macrophages. BS CXC seems show some structural and functional properties of the intermediate between ELR - CXC and ELR + CXC. Conclusion As an incomplete ELR + CXC chemokine from a modern fish, BS CXC provides some clues on the evolution from ancient ELR - CXC to ELR + CXC by retaining some properties of the intermediate stage in evolution, and it may be more appropriate to call this molecule 'piscine CXC with an incomplete ELR', instead of terming it fish 'IL- 8 '. </p...|$|E
