As 1981 and the locomotive's 150th birthday approached, the Smithsonian started discussions on how best to commemorate the locomotive's age and significance. There was very little question that special publications and exhibits would be prepared, but museum officials were left with the thought that the exhibit could still <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more than that.|$|E
25|$|Relevant is {{the fact}} that {{certainty}} is never absolute in practice (and not just because of David Hume's problem of induction). The equations of Newtonian mechanics can exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This {{is an example of the}} butterfly effect, which is one of the subjects of chaos theory. The idea is that something even as small as a butterfly could cause a chain reaction leading to a hurricane years later. Consequently, even a very small error in knowledge of initial conditions can result in arbitrarily large deviations from predicted behavior. Chaos theory thus explains why it may be practically impossible to predict real life, whether determinism is true or false. On the other hand, the issue may not <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about human abilities to predict or attain certainty as much as it is the nature of reality itself. For that, a closer, scientific look at nature is necessary.|$|E

[...] Subsequent Christmas specials {{were recorded in}} 1972 and 1973. [...] In 1975 a 13-episode television series was commissioned by ATV for ITV. Carry On Laughing ran for two seasons, with six half-hour episodes in season one and seven in season two. [...] The writer Penelope Gilliatt wrote: [...] "The usual charge to make against the Carry On films {{is to say that}} they could <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better done. [...] This is true enough. [...] They look dreadful, they seem to be edited with a bacon slicer, the effects are perfunctory and the comic rhythm jerks along like a cat on a cold morning.

500|$|In 1979, Sorkin {{attended}} Syracuse University. In {{his freshman}} year he failed a class that was a core requirement. It was a devastating setback {{because he wanted to}} be an actor, and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes. Determined to do better, he returned in his sophomore year, and graduated in 1983. Recalling the influence on him at college of drama teacher Arthur Storch, Sorkin recalled, after Storch's death in March 2013, that [...] "Arthur's reputation as a director, and as a disciple of Lee Strasberg, was a big reason why a lot of us went to [...] 'You have the capacity to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better than you are', he started saying to me in September of my senior year.

Harry Venning of The Stage commented that the {{eventual}} parting scene between Rose and the Doctor in [...] "Doomsday" [...] was [...] "beautifully written and movingly played," [...] with [...] "not a dry eye in the universe". Burk and Smith singled out Piper's performance in the episode for special praise stating she [...] "is astonishing at capturing the reality of someone whose world suddenly, finally collapses." [...] Remarking on Piper's departure, Dek Hogan of Digital Spy stated that [...] "Billie Piper’s energy has undoubtedly been one of the reasons that this revival has been so successful and the difficult third series will <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more so without her."

500|$|A different, widely {{circulated}} story {{suggests that}} Peel urinated on the pitch before being dismissed by Hawke. Woodhouse, writing in 1989, suggested that [...] "it {{is difficult to}} ascertain the truth behind this long-standing tale", while Hodgson observes: [...] "I have never been convinced of this account because it has always seemed to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{out of character for}} a cricketer of that time when so much stress was placed upon behaving 'like a gentleman' even in one's cups." [...] Mick Pope writes: [...] "The more recent accusation that Peel urinated on the pitch remains unjust, unproven and such a myth... that it should have no place in any study of Bobby Peel, the cricketer." [...] The story originated in a cricket publication, Cricket Quarterly, in 1968. The historian Rowland Bowen, in an article called [...] "Fresh Light on the Dismissal of R Peel in 1897", claimed that an [...] "aged Yorkshireman of 85" [...] told him that Peel had urinated and that this was a common practice then. Subsequent research by the historian Irving Rosewater established that Bowen's information came to him second-hand. The 85-year-old had not used the word [...] "urinated" [...] but had actually said [...] "pissed at the wicket", meaning that Peel was drunk ("pissed" [...] being slang for drunk) on the pitch ("at the wicket"). Rosewater suggests that this was merely repetition of the already known story, not the new information claimed by Bowen. Rosewater self-published his findings in a book called An Unjust Slur on Bobby Peel in 1997.|$|E
500|$|This {{editorial}} {{position would}} come back to haunt Stone. Also in 1870, Elizabeth Roberts Tilton told her husband Theodore Tilton that she had been carrying on an adulterous relation with his good friend Henry Ward Beecher. Theodore Tilton published an editorial saying that Beecher [...] "has at a most unseemly time of life been detected in improper intimacies with certain ladies of his congregation." [...] Tilton also informed Stanton about the alleged affair, and Stanton passed the information to Victoria Woodhull. Woodhull, a free love advocate, printed innuendo about Beecher, and began to woo Tilton, convincing him to write a book of her life story from imaginative material that she supplied. In 1871, Stone wrote to a friend [...] "my one wish in regard to Mrs. Woodhull is, that [...] she nor her ideas, may <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as heard of at our meeting." [...] Woodhull's self-serving activities were attracting disapproval from both centrist AWSA and radical NWSA. To divert criticism from herself, Woodhull published a denunciation of Beecher in 1872 saying that he practiced free love in private while speaking out against it from the pulpit. This caused a sensation in the press, and resulted in an inconclusive legal suit and a subsequent formal inquiry lasting well into 1875. The furor over adultery and the friction between various camps of women's rights activists took focus away from legitimate political aims. Harry Blackwell wrote to Stone from Michigan where he was working toward putting woman suffrage into the state constitution, saying [...] "This Beecher-Tilton affair is playing the deuce with [...] in Michigan. No chance of success this year I fancy." ...|$|E
500|$|Jenijoy La Belle assesses Lady Macbeth's {{femininity}} {{and sexuality}} {{as they relate}} to motherhood as well as witchhood. The fact that she conjures spirits likens her to a witch, and the act itself establishes a similarity in the way that both Lady Macbeth and the Weird Sisters from the play [...] "use the metaphoric powers of language to call upon spiritual powers who in turn will influence physical events — in one case the workings of the state, in the other the workings of a woman's body." [...] Like the witches, Lady Macbeth strives to make herself an instrument for bringing about the future She proves herself a defiant, empowered nonconformist, and an explicit threat to a patriarchal system of governance in that, through challenging his masculinity, she manipulates Macbeth into murdering King Duncan. Despite the fact that she calls him a coward, Macbeth remains reluctant, until she asks: [...] "What beast wasn't, then, that made you break this enterprise to me? / When you durst do it, then you were a man; / And to be more than what you were, you would / <b>Be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more the man." [...] Thus Lady Macbeth enforces a masculine conception of power, yet only after pleading to be unsexed, or defeminised. The Weird Sisters are also depicted as defeminised, androgynous figures. They are bearded (1.3.46), (which may also be associated with Lady Macbeth's amenorrhea). Witches were perceived as an extreme type of anti-mother, even considered capable of cooking and eating their own children. Although Lady Macbeth may not express violence toward her child with that same degree of grotesqueness, she certainly expresses a sense of brutality when she states that she would smash the baby's head.|$|E
