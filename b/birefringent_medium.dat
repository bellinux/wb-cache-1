Well known manifestations of this effect appear in optical wave plates/retarders (linear modes) and in Faraday rotation/optical rotation (circular modes). If the path length in the <b>birefringent</b> <b>medium</b> is sufficient, plane waves will exit the material with a significantly different propagation direction, due to refraction.

It was this effect that provided the first discovery of polarization, by Erasmus Bartholinus in 1669. In addition, the phase shift, and thus the change in polarization state, is usually frequency dependent, which, in combination with dichroism, often gives rise to bright colours and rainbow-like effects. In mineralogy, such properties, known as pleochroism, are frequently exploited for the purpose of identifying minerals using polarization microscopes. Additionally, many plastics that are not normally birefringent will become so when subject to mechanical stress, a phenomenon which is the basis of photoelasticity. Non-birefringent methods, to rotate the linear polarization of light beams, include the use of prismatic polarization rotators which use total internal reflection in a prism set designed for efficient collinear transmission.|$|E

As a differential phase starts to accrue, the polarization becomes elliptical, eventually changing to purely circular polarization (90° phase difference), then to elliptical and eventually linear polarization (180° phase) perpendicular to the original polarization, then through circular again (270° phase), then elliptical with the original azimuth angle, and finally {{back to the original}} linearly polarized state (360° phase) where the cycle begins anew. In general the situation is more complicated and can be characterized as a rotation in the Poincaré sphere about the axis defined by the propagation modes. Examples for linear (blue), circular (red), and elliptical (yellow) birefringence are shown in the figure on the left. The total intensity and degree of polarization are unaffected.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the nonlinear dynamics of a nonconventional (i. e., pumped by a mixed-mode wave) modulational instability {{in a highly}} <b>birefringent</b> nonlinear dispersive <b>medium.</b> We find that the depleted regime of propagation beyond the linearized stage can be described analytically in a proper region of the parameter space. In this case the governing coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations, which are not integrable, are reduced to an integrable one-dimensional nonlinear oscillator that rules the propagation of the pump wave and a single sideband pair. This approach permits us to predict the existence of stable and unstable manifolds of time-periodic solutions of the coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations. The nonlinear dynamics governed by these equations mimics the period-doubling instabilities associated with the homoclinic separatrices in the reduced phase space. Moreover, our approach is also capable of describing the onset of spatial chaos that occurs when the parameter values are such that the additional degree of freedom represented by the conjugated sidebands becomes effective...|$|R

30|$|Analysis {{of the pore}} {{formation}} rate {{in relation to a}} crystallographic direction is important both from the standpoint of fundamental science, for understanding the nature of the porous structure formation, and from the practical standpoint, for solving various technological tasks based on utilization of porous silicon (por-Si) [1 – 5] or for creating a <b>birefringent</b> optical <b>medium</b> based on nanostructured silicon [6, 7]. It is known that individual pores in meso-porous silicon form a dense array with a stable front propagating in the bulk of the crystal. Despite that individual pore channels in this array display strong anisotropy of their motion (microscopic anisotropy), the anisotropy in the propagation of the pore front (macroscopic anisotropy) is rather weak. Porous silicon has been intensively studied in the last two decades; however, the information about the macroscopic anisotropy of the electrochemical etching rate is scarce [8 – 12], and its quantitative characteristics are at all lacking. A possible reason is that no appropriate method of study has been developed so far. Recently, we suggested the method of local anodization of p-Si wafers through a mask in the form of narrow long wedges radiating from the center in all directions (‘wagon-wheel’ mask) [13], previously used to examine only the chemical etching anisotropy for Si in alkaline solutions [14, 15]. The under-etching for this mask depends on the motion rate of the porous-layer boundary along different crystallographic directions lying in the sample plane and makes it possible to determine quantitative parameters of the anisotropy.|$|R
