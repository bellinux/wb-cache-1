40|$|Abstract—Hydrochlorothiazide {{has been}} shown to exert direct {{vasodilator}} effects by activation of calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channels in human and guinea pig isolated resistance arteries. Since hydrochlorothiazide binds to and inhibits the enzyme carbonic anhydrase and because KCa channel activation is pH sensitive, we investigated the role of intracellular and extracellular carbonic anhydrase in the vascular effects of thiazide diuretics. Small arteries were isolated from guinea pig mesentery and studied by use of a microvascular myograph technique. In some experiments, tone and intracellular pH (pHi) were measured simultaneously with 29, 79 -bis(2 -carboxyethyl) - 5 (6) 9 -carboxyfluorescein (BCECF-AM). <b>Bendroflumethiazide,</b> a thiazide diuretic with minimal inhibitory effects on carbonic anhydrase, had little effect on noradrenaline-induced tone (1668 % relaxation) compared with hydrochlorothiazide (74612 % relaxation). In contrast to hydrochlorothiazide, the action of <b>bendroflumethiazide</b> was unaffected by 100 nmol/L charybdotoxin, a selective blocker of KCa channels. All inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase relaxed noradrenaline-induced tone in a concentration-dependent manner, and this effect was blocked by charybdotoxin. Hydrochlorothiazide and the inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase failed to relax tone induced by a depolarizing potassium solution. Acetazolamide and hydrochlorothiazide increased pHi by 0. 2760. 07 and 0. 2160. 04, respectively, whereas <b>bendroflumethiazide</b> had a much smaller effect: 0. 0660. 03.

40|$|Abstract Background High blood {{pressure}} is an important determinant of cardiovascular disease risk. Treated hypertensives do not attain a risk level equivalent to normotensives. This may be a consequence of suboptimal {{blood pressure}} control to which indiscriminate use of antihypertensive drugs may contribute. Indeed the recent ALLHAT 1 study suggests that thiazides should be given first to virtually all hypertensives. Whether this is correct or whether different antihypertensive therapies should be targeted towards different patients is a major unresolved issue, which we address in this study. The measurement of the ratio of aldosterone: renin is used to identify hypertensive subjects who may respond well to treatment with the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone. It is not known if subjects with a high ratio have aldosteronism or aldosterone-sensitive hypertension is debated {{but it is important}} to know whether spironolactone is superior to other diuretics such as <b>bendroflumethiazide</b> in this setting. Methods/design The study is a double-blind, randomised, crossover, controlled trial that will randomise 120 hypertensive subjects to 12 weeks treatment with spironolactone 50 mg once daily and 12 weeks treatment with <b>bendroflumethiazide</b> 2. 5 mg once daily. The 2 treatment periods are separated by a 2 -week washout period. Randomisation is stratified by aldosterone: renin ratio to include equal numbers of subjects with high and low aldosterone: renin ratios. Primary Objective – To test the hypothesis that the aldosterone: renin ratio predicts the antihypertensive response to spironolactone, specifically that the effect of spironolactone 50 mg is greater than that of <b>bendroflumethiazide</b> 2. 5 mg in hypertensive subjects with high aldosterone: renin ratios. Secondary Objectives – To determine whether <b>bendroflumethiazide</b> induces adverse metabolic abnormalities, especially in subjects with high aldosterone: renin ratios and if baseline renin measurement predicts the antihypertensive response to spironolactone and/or bendrofluazide Discussion The numerous deleterious effects of hypertension dictate the need for a systematic approach for its treatment. In spite of various therapies, resistant hypertension is widely prevalent. Among various factors, primary aldosteronism is an important cause of resistant hypertension and is now more commonly recognised. More significantly, hypertensives with primary aldosteronism are also exposed to various other deleterious effects of excess aldosterone. Hence treating hypertension with specific aldosterone antagonists may be a better approach in this group of patients. It may lead on to better blood pressures with fewer medications. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{beneficial}} effects of {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} (ACE) -inhibitors are in part mediated through the inhibition of the degradation of the vasodilator bradykinin. The bradykinin effect is counteracted by cyclooxygenase-inhibitors. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) do not affect bradykinin. Aims: To test the hypothesis that renal counteraction from a cyclooxygenase-inhibitor, diclofenac, is different in subjects treated with an ACE-inhibitor, enalapril compared with an ARB, losartan. Methods: Twelve elderly, healthy, slightly over-hydrated subjects received diclofenac orally after pre-treatment with a diuretic, <b>bendroflumethiazide,</b> and enalapril or <b>bendroflumethiazide</b> and losartan, in a double-blind cross-over fashion, with a wash-out period of at least 1 week. Results: Diclofenac reduced GFR significantly from 81 (64 - 98) ml/min at first observations after dose for enalapril to 29 (16 - 42) and from 76 (64 - 88) afler losartan to 35 (24 - 46).

40|$|Background and purpose: Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are {{carbonic}} anhydrase (CA) inhibitors {{effective in}} the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). Whether these drugs prevent vacuolar myopathy, which is a pathogenic factor in hypoPP, is unknown. The effects of these drugs on the efflux of lactate from skeletal muscle were also investigated. Experimental approach: For 10 days, K +-depleted rats, a model of hypoPP, were administered 5. 6 mg kg - 1 day - 1 of acetazolamide, dichlorphenamide or <b>bendroflumethiazide</b> (the last is not an inhibitor of CA). Histological analysis of vacuolar myopathy and in vitro lactate efflux measurements were performed in skeletal muscles from treated and untreated K +-depleted rats, and also from normokalemic rats. Key results: About {{three times as many}} vacuoles were found in the type II fibres of tibialis anterioris muscle sections from K +-depleted rats as were found in the same muscle from normokalemic rats. In ex vivo experiments, a higher efflux of lactate on in vitro incubation was found in muscles of K +-depleted rats compared with that found in muscles from normokalemic rats. After treatment of K +-depleted rats with acetazolamide, the numbers of vacuoles in tibialis anterioris muscle decreased to near normal values. Incubation with acetazolamide in vitro inhibited efflux of lactate from muscles of K +-depleted rats. In contrast, <b>bendroflumethiazide</b> and dichlorphenamide failed to prevent vacuolar myopathy after treatment in vivo and failed to inhibit lactate efflux in vitro. Conclusions and implications: Acetazolamide prevents vacuolar myopathy in K +-depleted rats. This effect was associated with inhibition of lactate transport, rather than inhibition of CA.

Ther. 172 : 203 - 210, 1970. The effect of <b>bendroflumethiazide</b> (BHFT) on the metabolic processes supporting transepithe!ial Na transport in the isolated toad bladder has been studied. The thiazide inhibited short-circuit current (5 CC) in bladders depleted of endogenous gly-cogen, inhibited stimulation of SOC by glucose and pyruvate and inhibited SOC supported solely by anaerobic metabolism. The drug does not interfere with glycolysis since it in-creases lactate accumulation. BHFT, however, did depress O consumption. The effect on lactate accumulation and O consumption also occurred in the absence of Na indicating that the drug has a direct effect on metabolism and may not directly affect the Na transport mechanism. Ouabain, which depresses lactate accumulation and inhibits Na-K-activated adenosine triphosphatase, caused the same fractional inhibition of SOC in bladders pretreated with BHFT as in control bladders indicating that the effects of these two inhibitors are quite different.

Measures of insulin-responses, serum electrolytes levels and patch-clamp experiments were therefore performed inKC-deficient rats treated in vivo with dichlorphenamide (DCP), ethoxzolamide (ETX), hydrochlorthiazide (HCT), methazolamide (MTZ), <b>bendroflumethiazide</b> (BFT) and acetazolamide (ACTZ). Ten days treatments ofKC-deficient rats with DCP, BFT, ETX and ACTZ (5. 6 mg/kg per day) restored the serum [KC] to control values and prevented the insulin-induced paralysis. In ex vivo experiments, the carbonic-anhydrase inhibitors enhanced the activity of Ca 2 C-activated-KCchannels with the order of efficacy: ACTZOBFTOETXODCP. In contrast, HCT and MTZ failed to stimulate the Ca 2 C-activated-KCchannels and to prevent the hypokalaemia and paralysis. At the concentration of 1 mg/kg per day, all these drugs failed to ameliorate the hypokalaemic-PP symptoms. The activation of Ca 2 C-activated-KCchannel {{in addition to the}} mild diuretic effect explained the efficacy of ACTZ and DCP in KC-deficient rats and in familial hypokalaemic-PP...|$|E
40|$|THESIS 8528 The {{studies in}} this thesis {{explored}} the solid state and inhalation properties of various systems produced by the spray drying technique. The work focused on the feasibility analysis of spray drying {{as a means of}} producing materials for pulmonary delivery. The chemical and physical stability of different processed systems have also been addressed. The drugs investigated were salbutamol base, formoterol fumarate dihydrate, budesonide, <b>bendroflumethiazide,</b> hydroflumethiazide and hydrochlorothiazide. In all cases the physicochemical characteristics were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The inhalation properties were investigated using the twin stage impinger. Different aspects of chemical and physical stability studies were examined. Spray drying of salbutamol base alone resulted in predominantly amorphous powdered products and the degree of amorphicity depended on the spray drying conditions. Difficulties in processing were observed with the drug exhibiting stickiness due to its low glass transition temperature. Co-spray drying of salbutamol base with sugars and PVP resulted in composite particles that demonstrated a lesser degree of particle fusion...|$|E
40|$|Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) elicits natriuresis; {{however, the}} {{relative}} contributions of proximal and distal nephron segments {{to the overall}} ANP-induced natriuresis have remained uncertain. This study was performed to characterize the effects of ANP on distal nephron sodium reabsorption determined after blockade {{of the two major}} distal nephron sodium transporters with amiloride (5 μg/g body wt) plus <b>bendroflumethiazide</b> (12 μg/g body wt) in male anesthetized C 57 /BL 6 and natriuretic peptide receptor-A gene (Npr 1) targeted four-copy mice. The lower dose of ANP (0. 1 ng·g body wt− 1 ·min− 1, n = 6) increased distal sodium delivery (DSD, 2. 4 ± 0. 4 vs. 1. 6 ± 0. 2 μeq/min, P 0. 05), thus limiting the magnitude of the natriuresis. In contrast, the higher dose (0. 2 ng·g body wt− 1 ·min− 1, n = 6) increased DSD (2. 8 ± 0. 3 μeq/min, P 0. 05). These results provide in vivo evidence that ANP-mediated increases in DSD alone exert modest effects on sodium excretion and that inhibition of fractional reabsorption of distal sodium delivery is requisite for the augmented natriuresis in response to the higher dose of ANP or in Npr 1 gene-duplicated mice...|$|E

However, the in vivo effects of these drugs in K+-deficient rats, the animal model of familial hypokalaemic periodic paralysis(hypokalaemic-PP), are currently unknown. Measures of insulin-responses, serum electrolytes levels and patch-clamp experiments were therefore performed in K+ -deficient rats treated in vivo with dichlorphenamide (DCP), ethoxzolamide (ETX), hydrochlorthiazide (HCT), methazolamide (MTZ), <b>bendroflumethiazide</b> (BFT) and acetazolamide (ACTZ). Ten days treatments of K+-deficient rats with DCP, BFT, ETX and ACTZ (5. 6 mg/kg per day) restored the serum [K+] to control values and prevented the insulin-induced paralysis. In ex vivo experiments, the carbonic-anhydrase inhibitors enhanced the activity of Ca 2 +-activated-K+ channels with the order of efficacy: ACTZ>BFT>ETX>DCP.
