5|$|About 20 large (40–150m across) ejecta <b>blocks</b> {{have been}} identified, {{embedded}} in Ida's regolith. Ejecta <b>blocks</b> constitute the largest {{pieces of the}} regolith. Because ejecta <b>blocks</b> are expected to break down quickly by impact events, those present on the surface must have been either formed recently or uncovered by an impact event. Most of them are located within the craters Lascaux and Mammoth, {{but they may not}} have been produced there. This area attracts debris due to Ida's irregular gravitational field. Some <b>blocks</b> may have been ejected from the young crater Azzurra {{on the opposite side of}} the asteroid.|$|E

5|$|DAB radio {{stations}} in the United Kingdom are broadcast {{on a number of}} frequency <b>blocks</b> on VHF Band III. The original plan devised in Wiesbaden for the framework of DAB in Europe was to allocate frequency <b>blocks</b> 11B to 12D for UK DAB broadcasting. However, as part of its Review of Radio, Ofcom has expanded the frequency allocations for DAB and has advertised local and a national ensemble licence on <b>blocks</b> outside the original Wiesbaden plan on 10B to 10D and 11A. Block 5A has also been reserved for the launch of local ensembles. In 2015, additional <b>blocks</b> were opened up for small scale DAB trials for an initial period of nine months. Ofcom reitreated the use of a number of frequency <b>blocks</b> between 7D and 9C for any future roll-out of small scale DAB multiplexes in its final report regarding the small scale DAB multiplexes published in September 2016.|$|E

5|$|Like much of British post-war planning, {{regeneration}} of Bristol {{city centre}} was characterised by large, cheap tower <b>blocks,</b> brutalist architecture {{and expansion of}} roads.

5|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, the {{development}} of antiviral drugs has increased rapidly, mainly driven by the AIDS pandemic. Antiviral drugs are often nucleoside analogues, which are molecules very similar, but not identical to DNA building <b>blocks.</b> When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of these fake building <b>blocks</b> are incorporated. As soon as that happens, replication stops prematurely—the fake building <b>blocks</b> lack the essential features that allow the addition of further building <b>blocks.</b> Thus, DNA production is halted, and the virus can no longer reproduce. Examples of nucleoside analogues are aciclovir for herpes virus infections and lamivudine for HIV and hepatitis B virus infections. Aciclovir {{is one of the}} oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.|$|E

5|$|Ownership of the {{continuous}} park <b>blocks</b> {{was not without}} dispute, however. After Lownsdale died without a will, and then his wife Nancy died, his estate challenged that his plat didn't require the central section to be dedicated to public use since Nancy had not signed over legal title to the land. The courts agreed in 1865. Benjamin Stark reneged on the donation of two north central park <b>blocks</b> to the city, instead offering to sell them for $138,000. Captain John H. Couch deeded his section, which became the North Park <b>Blocks</b> to the city on January 25, 1865, only ten days after receiving the federal patent for the land. Six of the South Park <b>Blocks</b> were lost to private parties in the 1870s, and elected city officials were unwilling to spend the asking price of $6,000 per block to purchase them so soon after the city had bought the land for Washington Park. Only a year later, a proposal to acquire the six <b>blocks</b> for $92,000 was brought by the city council, showing the increase in prices in that year.|$|E
5|$|Portland was platted in 1845, then Daniel H. Lownsdale {{purchased}} land {{south and}} west of the original platting. He drew up a plat in 1848 that included 11 narrow <b>blocks,</b> 100×200 feet, instead of the standard 200×200 feet. He then brought on Stephen Coffin and William W. Chapman as partners, and dedicated the South Park <b>Blocks</b> and midtown park <b>blocks</b> in 1852. This made them the first official greenspace in Portland. While they were dedicated to the city, they weren't owned by the city until September 22, 1870, when Mayor Bernard Goldsmith and Chapman agreed on selling the South Park <b>Blocks</b> and the two Plaza <b>Blocks</b> (Chapman and Lownsdale Squares) to the city for $6,250. Most {{of the purchase price}} was for the Plaza <b>Blocks,</b> since the park <b>blocks</b> were {{at the edge of the}} developed city.|$|E
