50|$|Bernhard <b>Bötel</b> (1883-1953) was a German operatic tenor {{and actor}} {{who had an}} active career in Germany and Austria {{during the first half}} of the 20th century. He made {{recordings}} for several record labels during the early years of the recording industry, including His Master's Voice, Odeon Records, Polydor Records, Tri-Ergon, and Vox Records. On the stage he sang a variety of roles in operas and operettas from leading parts to comprimario roles. His stage repertoire included Belmonte in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Die Entführung aus dem Serail, Chapelou in Adolphe Adam's Le postillon de Lonjumeau, Count Almaviva in Gioachino Rossini's The Barber of Seville, Daniel in Franz Lehár's The Merry Widow, the Duke of Mantua in Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto, Gabriel von Eisenstein in Johann Strauss II's Die Fledermaus, Indigo in Strauss' Indigo und die vierzig Räuber, Jeník in Bedřich Smetana's The Bartered Bride, Paolino in Domenico Cimarosa's Il matrimonio segreto, Pâris in Jacques Offenbach's La belle Hélène, Pietro in Franz von Suppé's Boccaccio, and Wilhelm Meister in Ambroise Thomas' Mignon. <b>Bötel</b> was the son of tenor Heinrich <b>Bötel.</b> He began his voice training with Mathieu Lorent in Hamburg, and later continued his studies with Ernst Grenzebach in Berlin. He made his professional stage debut in 1905 at Theater Aachen as Lancelot in Edmond Audran's La poupée. From 1906 until 1910, he was committed to the Komische Oper Berlin where he was lauded for his portrayal of the title role in Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann. From 1909 to 1911, he sang in several operettas at the Theater an der Wien; most notably creating the role of Armand Brissard in the world premiere of Lehár's Der Graf von Luxemburg in November 1909. From 1912 to 1914, he was committed to the Raimund Theater in Vienna, and in 1914-1915 he was a member of the Halle Opera House. He spent the next two decades performing roles from the tenor buffo repertoire at the Berlin State Opera. In 1917, he created the lead tenor role of Hans in the premier of Jugend by Ignatz Waghalter at the Deutsche Opernhaus in Berlin. He also appeared at the Kroll Opera House from 1928 to 1931 and frequently as a leading tenor in operettas in Berlin opposite soprano Fritzi Massary. He retired from the stage in 1935.|$|E

The first two species were found in Lanyu Island (formerly known as <b>Botel</b> Tobago or Kotosho), an offshore island southeast of Taiwan proper, and the remaining three species in Taiwan proper. Following the morphological descriptions, the distribution, biology, and systematics of the species are discussed. 本編ではTripteroides, Orthopodomyia, Culiseta及びUranotaenia属の新種の成熟幼虫,蛹及び雌雄成虫に就て記載を行なった. これらはそれぞれTripteroides (Tripteroides) chen, n. sp., Orthopodomyia lanyuensis, n. sp., Culiseta (Culiseta) lishanensis, n. sp., Uranotaenia lui, n. sp. 及びUranotaenia nii, n. sp. と命名された. 前二者は台湾本島東南方の蘭嶼(紅頭嶼) で,他の三種は台湾本島で採集された. Tripteroides cheni, n. sp. はnitidoventer群に属し,T. bambusaに酷似するが,後者とは次の様な相違点がある. 1) 雄陰茎側面の形状, 2) 雌の貯精嚢は一箇のみ,後者では三箇, 3) 成虫の中胸背板の被膜は褐色,後者では黒色. 幼虫は区別が難しいが,前胸の 4 号毛は前者では 4 ～ 5 本,後者では 2 ～ 3 本に分枝する. 雄陰茎の側面形状はT. poweliのとはある程度近似する。Orthopodomyia lanyuensis, n. sp. はanopheloides亜群に属し,幼虫は腹部の第一及び第二腹節の 6 号毛が太くなっている点でO. madrensisに酷似するが,成虫は腹部の腹面が一様に白色ではなく,翅の前縁脈基部の白色部分が狭く,吻の斑紋も異なる点等で区別される. 後肢の白色斑紋はO. wilsoniのに酷似するが,幼虫は腹部の第一及び第二腹節の 6 号毛の形状で異なる.

40|$|Members of {{the class}} Epsilonproteobacteria {{are known to be}} of major {{importance}} in biogeochemical processes at oxic-anoxic interfaces. In pelagic redoxclines of the central Baltic Sea, an uncultured epsilonproteobacterium related to Sulfurimonas denitrificans was proposed to {{play a key role in}} chemolithotrophic denitrification (I. Brettar, M. Labrenz, S. Flavier, J. <b>Bötel,</b> H. Kuosa, R. Christen, and M. G. Höfle, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 72 : 1364 - 1372, 2006). In order to determine the abundance, activity, and vertical distribution of this bacterium in high-resolution profiles, 16 S rRNA cloning and catalyzed reporter deposition and fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) and quantitative PCR measurements were carried out. The results showed that 21 % of the derived clone sequences, which in the present study were grouped together under the name GD 17, had > 99 % similarity to the uncultured epsilonproteobacterium. A specific gene probe against GD 17 (S-*-Sul- 0090 -a-A- 18) was developed and used for enumeration by CARD-FISH. In different pelagic redoxclines sampled during August 2003, May 2005, and February 2006, GD 17 cells were always detected from the lower oxic area to the sulfidic area. Maximal abundance was detected around the chemocline, where sulfide and nitrate concentrations were close to the detection limit. The highest GD 17 numbers (2 × 105 cells ml− 1), representing up to 15 % of the total bacteria, were comparable to those reported for Epsilonproteobacteria in pelagic redoxclines of the Black Sea and the Cariaco Trench (X. Lin, S. G. Wakeham, I. F. Putnam, Y. M. Astor, M. I. Scranton, A. Y. Chistoserdov, and G. T. Taylor, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 72 : 2679 - 2690, 2006).

40|$|Abstract. Using the Fry Readability Graph, {{parameter}} readability {{values were}} (a) {{obtained for the}} 21 reader, and the 4 th reader of one basal series; (b) obtained from the 31 readers of three basal series; (c) obtained for stories or selections drawn randomly from the readers studied; (d) compared with the readability values of randomly drawn sample sets of varying sizes. Results showed (a) substantial (at least seven grade levels) intrabook readability variation; (b) agreement between Fry book parameter means and book grade designations for all books studied except one; (c) substantial intrabook story differences in average readability and readability variation; (d) no pattern of intrabook story difficulty; (e) a set of 24 samples necessary to adequately predict book parameter readability values. There is a body of evidence showing that a basal reader's grade designation reveals little about its difficulty. For example, vocabulary burden at a given reading level can vary greatly from one series to another {Dolch, 1928; Johnson, 1962). Books from different series intended for use at the same grade level can also vary greatly from {{one another in the}} complexity and type of sentence patterns used (Strickland, 1962). In addition, intrabook syntactic complexity may not increase systematically (Strickland, 1962; Kaiser, Neils, and Floriani, 1975). Furthermore, the average measured readability (using a standardized formula or technique) can vary greatly for books across different series designated for the same reading level, and the variation of readability within a book can be extreme, ranging over a number of levels (Walchak, 1954; <b>Botel,</b> Bradley, and Kashuba, 1970; Bradley, 1973). Intrabook readability variation can greatly affect reading performance. Bradley and Ames (1976) investigated the effect of intrabook readability variation on oral reading performance.
