This study evaluated the utility and potential interchangeability of two transduction-type PD models: a cell distribution model (CDM) and a signal distribution model (<b>SDM).</b> <b>The</b> evaluation was performed by simulating dense and sparse tumor response data with one model and analyzing it using the other. Performance was scored by visual inspection and precision of parameter estimation. Capture of tumor response data was also evaluated for a liposomal formulation of paclitaxel in the paclitaxel-resistant murine Colon- 26 model. A suitable PK model was developed by simultaneous fitting of literature data for paclitaxel formulations in mice. Analysis of the simulated tumor response data revealed that <b>the</b> <b>SDM</b> was more flexible in describing delayed drug effects upon tumor volume progression.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} rapidly and automatically fabricating functional metal parts directly from CAD models. A newly developed process called Shape Deposition Manufacturing (<b>SDM)</b> is introduced. <b>The</b> process {{is based on the}} concept of layered manufacturing in SFF, but uses separate deposition and shaping steps to create a layer. Three dimensionally shaped layers are created using 5 -axis CNC machining, to achieve the required geometric accuracy for fully functional shapes. Thermal deposition technologies (thermal spraying, welding) are used to achieve the required material properties. A novel, droplet based deposition process, microcasting, has been developed, to create well- bonded, high-strength material, while minimising the heat input into previously shaped layers. To create layers with a true three dimensional geometry, more detailed building strategies, than used by conventional SFF processes, are required <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>SDM</b> process. A CAD based planning system, which {{addresses the}}se issues by decomposing a solid model of a part into layers and manufacturable, fully three dimensional segments is described. An automated testbed facility installed at Carnegie Mellon's Shape Deposition Laboratory is discussed, and shows the feasibility of automating the process. The microcasting process is explained in detail and its performance in <b>the</b> <b>SDM</b> environment is evaluated. Different strategies and material combinations for the support structure have been developed and are presented with detailed descriptions of several building strategies for parts with various complexity and material quality. Material properties of structures created <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>SDM</b> process are evaluated. Problems affecting the accuracy and material integrity of SDM created structures, which mainly involve the buildup of thermal stresses during material deposition, are identified and opened for future research.

40|$|Background: There {{are limited}} {{published}} comparative data regarding the sensitivity {{and timing of}} early signal detection with commonly used signal detection methods (<b>SDMs),</b> including <b>the</b> reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), information component (IC) and gamma Poisson shrinker (GPS). Objective: To examine the sensitivity and timing of early signal detection across four <b>SDMs</b> using <b>the</b> Adverse Events Reporting System (AERS) database of the US Food and Drug Administration. Methods: <b>The</b> four <b>SDMs</b> were applied to retrospectively detect ten confirmed drug-event combinations (DECs). The sensitivity to detect adverse events {{was defined as the}} percentage of DECs detected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> respective <b>SDMs</b> as positive signals. The timing of early signal detection was measured <b>by</b> comparing <b>the</b> index date of withdrawal (IDW), defined as the date on which the drug was removed from the market, with the index date of detection (IDD), defined as a date on which the signal was significantly detected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>SDM.</b> Results: <b>The</b> estimated sensitivity was 100 % for ROR, 90 % for PRR and IC and 70 % for GPS. The sensitivity increased with increasing numbers of reports per DEC. Compared with the IDW, the signals were detected on average 10 quarters earlier by ROR, 9 quarters earlier by PRR, 9. 9 quarters earlier <b>by</b> <b>the</b> IC and 4. 7 quarters earlier <b>by</b> GPS. Conclusions: <b>The</b> sensitivity and timing of early signal detection varies across <b>the</b> four <b>SDMs.</b> Numerically, <b>the</b> ROR showed better performance in sensitivity and early signal detection based on ten selected DECs.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was {{to assist in the}} development of an assessment system that supports caseworkers in Child Welfare Service (CWS) in making informed decision regarding the families they are serving. Caseworkers CWS have a difficult job of protecting and promoting the well-being of vulnerable children. To accomplish this task, they need assessment tools that both predict future maltreatment and provide guidance on family functioning, service need, and treatment progress. This dissertation presents two studies that examine the results of seven standardized self-report assessments obtained from 318 caregivers involved with CWS (235 families) whose children are in their care, and attempts to use these data to address some of the assessment needs in CWS. Study 1 examined the standardized assessment results and used survival analysis to determine whether the assessments were independently predictive of future child maltreatment and whether they added predictive value to the Structured Decision Making (<b>SDM)</b> <b>tool</b> used by CWS. Due to the coercive nature of caregivers involvement with CWS, the data were analyzed separately for caregivers who were categorized as reporting non-defensively and defensively on the Parent Stress Index. The assessment results for caregivers who were categorized as non-defensive provided insights into the families' struggles and added predictive value both independently and additionally when included in survival analysis with <b>the</b> <b>SDM.</b> For defensive caregivers, the assessments did not appear to provide insights into their struggles, and scores were not predictive of future child maltreatment. The results indicated no significant difference in survival time between the defensive and non-defensive caregivers. Furthermore, caseworkers appeared to struggle with the assessment of the defensive responders, as indicated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>SDMs</b> lack of predictive value for these families. Study 2 examined how the data from the non-defensive responders could be used to develop a self-report multidimensional assessment of caregivers involved with CWS. Item Response Theory (IRT) was used to examine the functioning of items on two of the administered assessments. The results indicated both adequate item difficulty and item discrimination parameters. IRT was used to reduce the assessment length, resulting in shorter scales with similar predictive validity. Lastly, the study investigated how IRT can assist in the development of assessment tools that address assessment needs of CWS including potentially being resistant to the defensive responding of caregivers...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFalling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) {{has been}} used by many road {{agencies}} worldwide for structural evaluation of both flexible and concrete pavements since the 1980 s. With the development of Traffic Speed Deflectometer (TSD), the laser-based deflectograph is increasing used to perform continuous bearing capacity measurement at a range of driving speeds. The two main advantages of the TSD technology are; its ability to carry out continuous deflection measurements rather than at discrete points and the tests can be carried out at traffic speed without the need for lane closure in the case a stationary device such as the FWD. The objective {{of this paper is to}} study the deflection basins generated by TSD on flexible pavements using Simplified Deflection Model (<b>SDM).</b> <b>The</b> study shows that TSD data can be modelled accurately using SDM that can be represented in a mathematical form of Y = K 1 exp (-r/K 2). K 1 is equal to deflection at D 0 in micron and K 2 is the structural parameter at the respective sensor location r. It is observed that the majority of the pavement sections possess nonlinear subgrade behaviour in the TSD deflection data. The dynamic effects generated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> TSD axle load are likely to be the reason for the pavements to exhibit subgrade nonlinearity. A comparison between the FWD and TSD data shows a high level of correlation and a mathematical model has been established for estimation of FWD deflections using the TSD data.

Hanford's role was to produce weapons-grade nuclear material for defense, and <b>by</b> 1989, when <b>the</b> Site's mission changed from operations to cleanup, Hanford had produced more than 60 percent of the nation's plutonium. The legacy of Hanford's production years is enormous in terms of nuclear and hazardous waste, especially the 270 billion gallons of contaminated groundwater and the 5 million cubic yards of contaminated soil. Managing the contaminated soil and groundwater are particularly important because the Columbia River, the lifeblood of the northwest and the nation's eighth largest river, bounds the Site. Fluor Hanford's Soil & Groundwater Remediation Project (S&GRP) integrates all of the activities that deal with remediating and monitoring the groundwater across the Site. The S&GRP uses a detailed series of steps to record, track, and verify information. The Sample and Data Management (SDM) Process consists of 10 integrated steps that start with the data quality objectives process that establishes the mechanism for collecting the right information with the right people. The process ends with data quality assessment, which is used to ensure that all quantitative data (e. g., field screening, fixed laboratory) are the right type, and of adequate quality to support the decision-making process.

Non-seasonal key areas were located off northeast Brazil on an area of high biodiversity, and with relatively low human impacts. We found support for the use of seasonal areas depending on the seabird assemblage used, because there was a loss in conservation value for the seasonal compared to the non-seasonal approach when using ‘cost’ layers. Our approach, accounting for seasonal changes in seabird assemblages and their risk of extinction, identified additional candidate areas for incorporation in the network of pelagic MPAs...|$|R
40|$|The {{southern}} European peninsulas (Iberian, Italian and Balkan) {{are traditionally}} recognized as glacial refugia from where many species colonized central and northern Europe after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). However, evidence that some species had more northerly refugia is accumulating from phylogeographic, palaeontological and palynological studies, {{and more recently}} from species distribution modelling (SDM), but further {{studies are needed to}} test the idea of northern refugia in Europe. Here, we take a rarely implemented multidisciplinary approach to assess if the pygmy shrew Sorex minutus, a widespread Eurasian mammal species, had northern refugia during the LGM, and if these influenced its postglacial geographic distribution. First, we evaluated the phylogeographic and population expansion patterns using mtDNA sequence data from 123 pygmy shrews. Then, we used SDM to predict present and past (LGM) potential distributions using two different training data sets, two different algorithms (Maxent and GARP) and climate reconstructions for the LGM with two different general circulation models. An LGM distribution in the southern peninsulas was predicted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>SDM</b> approaches, in line with the occurrence of lineages of S. minutus in these areas. The phylogeographic analyses also indicated a widespread and strictly northern-central European lineage, not derived from southern peninsulas, and with a postglacial population expansion signature. This was consistent with <b>the</b> <b>SDM</b> predictions of suitable LGM conditions for S. minutus occurring across central and eastern Europe, from unglaciated parts of the British Isles to much of the eastern European Plain. Hence, S. minutus likely persisted in parts of central and eastern Europe during the LGM, from where it colonized other northern areas during the late-glacial and postglacial periods.

40|$|Habitat {{loss and}} {{fragmentation}} are major threats to biodiversity. Geostatistical methods, especially kriging, {{are widely used}} in ecology. Bird counts data often fail to show normal distribution over an area which is required {{for most of the}} kriging methods. Hence choosing an interpolation method without understanding the implications may lead to bias results. United Kingdom’s Exprodat Consulting Ltd had set an Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) workflow for optimising interpolation of petroleum dataset. This workflow was applied in this study to predict capercaillie bird species over whole Sweden. There was no trend found in the dataset. Also the dataset was not spatially auto-correlated. A completely regularized spline surface model was created with RMSE 1. 336. Medium to high occurrences (8 - 16) were found over two very small areas, within Västerbottens county and Västra Götlands county. Low occurrences (1 - 3) were found all over Sweden. Urban areas like Stockholm city and Malmö city had low occurrences. Another kriging prediction surface was created with RMSE 1. 314 to compare the results. There were no prediction values from 5 to 16 in kriging surface. In-depth studies were carried out by selecting three areas. The studies showed that the results of local kriging surfaces did not match with the results of global surface. Uncertainty in GIS may exist at any level. Having low RMSE value does not always mean a good result. Hence ESDA before choosing interpolation method is an effective way. And a post result field investigation could make it more valid. Regression analysis is also widely used in ecology and there are certain different methods that are available to be used. Ordinary Least Squares is the first method that was tested upon bird counts data set. Adjusted R-squared value was 0. 008616 which indicated that explanatory variables pine, spruce, roads, urban areas and wetlands were just contributing to 0. 8 % to the dependent variable bird counts. It was also found that there was no linear relationship between dependent and explanatory variables. Logistic regression was the next step as it had the capability to work with nonlinear data also. The Spatial Data Modeller (<b>SDM)</b> <b>tool</b> was used to perform logistic regression in ArcGIS 9. 3. Initially results of logistic regression were unexpected, hence focal statistics was performed upon all the independent variables. Logistic regression with these new independent variables generated meaningful results. This time the probability of occurrence of birds had weak positive relationship with all the independent variables. Coefficients of pine, spruce, roads, urban areas and wetlands were found to be 0. 39, 0. 23, 0. 13, 0. 24 and 0. 14 respectively. Pine and spruce are natural attractors for birds, hence results were quite acceptable. But the overall model performance remained poor. Positive coefficient for roads, urban areas and wetlands may well be due to redundancy in these datasets or observer bias in bird species reporting. IDRISI Andes also came up with almost the same results when logistic regression with same dependent and independent variables was performed. IDRISI Andes output contained the pseudo R-square value, found to be 0. 0416. This was an indication of biasness in the dataset also. The results of in-depth studies by selecting three areas also showed that LR with focal statistics were having better results than LR without focal statistics, but the overall performance remained poor. <b>The</b> <b>SDM</b> <b>tool</b> is a good choice for performing logistic regression on small scale datasets due to its limitation.

Indeed, it {{represents one of the}} key assumptions underlying species distribution models (<b>SDMs),</b> <b>the</b> main <b>tool</b> currently available for predicting range shifts of species. However, to date, no comprehensive assessment of niche conservatism is available for the marine realm. We use <b>the</b> invasion <b>by</b> Indo-Pacific tropical fishes into the Mediterranean Sea, the world's most invaded marine basin, to examine the conservatism of the climatic niche. We show that tropical invaders may spread far beyond their native niches and that SDMs do not predict their new distributions better than null models. Our results suggest that <b>SDMs</b> may underestimate <b>the</b> potential spread of invasive species and call for prudence in employing these models in order to forecast species invasion and their response to environmental change...|$|R
40|$|Ongoing rapid {{climate change}} is {{predicted}} to cause local extinction of plant species in mountain regions. However, some plant species could have persisted during Quaternary climate oscillations without shifting their range, despite the limited evidence from fossils. Here, we tested two candidate mechanisms of persistence <b>by</b> comparing <b>the</b> macrorefugia and microrefugia hypotheses. We used the rare and endemic Saxifraga florulenta as a model taxon and combined ensembles of species distribution models (SDMs) with a high-resolution paleoclimatic and topographic dataset to reconstruct its potential current and past distribution since the last glacial maximum. To test the macrorefugia hypothesis, we verified whether the species could have persisted in or shifted to geographic areas defined by its realized niche. We then identified potential microrefugia based on climatic and topographic properties of the landscape and applied refined scenarios of microrefugia dynamics and functions over time. Last, we quantified the number of known occurrences that could be explained <b>by</b> either <b>the</b> macrorefugia or microrefugia model. A consensus {{of two or three}} SDM techniques predicted absence between 14 - 10, 3 - 4 ka and 1 ka BP, which did not support the macrorefugia model. In contrast, we showed that S. florulenta could have contracted into microrefugia during periods of absence predicted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>SDMs</b> and later re-colonized suitable areas according to the macrorefugia model. Assuming a limited and realistic seed dispersal distance for our species, we explained a large number of the current occurrences (61 - 96 %). Additionally, we showed that microrefugia could have facilitated range expansions or shifts of S. florulenta. Finally, we found that the most recent and the most stable microrefugia were the ones closest to current occurrences. Hence, we propose a novel paradigm to explain plant persistence <b>by</b> highlighting <b>the</b> importance of supporting functions of microrefugia when forecasting the fate of plant species under climate change.

40|$|Four of {{the leading}} breakup models, IDES, SDM, MASTER and EVOLVE 4 were {{compared}} {{in terms of their}} distributions of the cumulative number of fragments, fragment delta-vs and mass-to-area ratios with respect to fragment mass. These comparisons were made for a number of fragmentation scenarios including high and low intensity explosions and catastrophic and non-catastrophic collisions. It has been found that <b>the</b> IDES, <b>SDM</b> and MASTER models are generally in fairly good agreement for all these distributions in all scenarios, although there are slight differences to be found in certain cases. the EVOLVE 4 model produces generally different results for all scenarios, most notably in its delta-v and mass-tp-area distributions. the major differences between all the models in terms of their equations are discussed herein. An example scenario of a low intensity explosion in GEO was chosen and the resulting debris cloud for all models was propagated using the same high-fidelity orbital propagator. The differences in the propagated clouds for each model were compared. Generally the debris clouds produced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> IDES, <b>SDM</b> and MASTER models were in fairly good agreement for most scenarios, whilst the debris cloud produced by EVOLVE 4 shows some significant differences...|$|R
40|$|M, Development and Management, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2012 A {{number of}} {{government}} initiatives {{have been established}} over recent years (1994 - 2010) to address the challenge of raising overall quality of life by improving productivity in South Africa. High productivity at a municipal level contributes to the overall productivity of the national economy, which in turn helps to create higher living standards. Workplace productivity refers to how efficiently and effectively an institution can turn its inputs, such as labour and capital, into outputs, such as products and services. Finding ways to increase productivity is a task that can be both frustrating and time consuming. Sedibeng District Municipality (SDM) {{as one of the}} South African local municipalities required to meet the development mandate for improving the lives of the people. Mega-events such as the FIFA 2010 Soccer World Cup in South Africa are perceived as an inhibiting factor towards service delivery. SDM is also challenged to complement the requirements of the FIFA 2010 Soccer World Cup to its daily activities. There are mixed opinions about the event. There are misconceptions about mega-events such as the FIFA World Cup, whereby managers estimated that there will be lost hours of productivity. Some managers predicted that a strong performance <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>SDM</b> would help <b>the</b> municipality’s ailing economy through boosted sales for beverages, food and the team's apparels. The primary goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the perceptions of productivity on service delivery during the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup at SDM. Exploration was also made on whether the effective strategic planning can help to improve productivity for future mega events such as the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup. As a result to this, a hypothesis was developed that “a focused effort and strategic approaches to increase workplace productivity during mega events (2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup) in SDM is essential, towards continuous improvement of municipal management and operations in order to deliver sustainable competitive advantage”. The hypothesis and research objectives of the study were validated by means of a literature review and empirical surveys and, in so doing open-ended and closed-ended estionnaires were used to interview participants. For the achievement of the primary objective of the study, five chapters were structured to realize the objectives of this study. This was done through a literature review by means of interviews and questionnaires to <b>the</b> <b>SDM</b> and its community members. A sample of 60 community members and municipal employees were consulted for this study. The research findings highlighted the outcomes of the research and verified the assertions made in this study. The study found that: • Productivity plays an important role in municipal service delivery, and it should be a priority and primary objective towards effective service delivery in all municipalities. • Productivity growth is important because, as a key driver of real GDP growth, it improves the prosperity and living standards of <b>the</b> population in <b>SDM.</b> • <b>The</b> absence of an effective strategy may lead to lack and low productivity • Strategic plan in <b>the</b> <b>SDM</b> plays an important role in ensuring sustainable delivery of services. • The impact of the FIFA 2010 World Cup, were minimal, whereby <b>the</b> plans of <b>SDM</b> were incorporated in the Integrated Development Plan for 2006 - 2010. • The event boosted the moral of community members and for small businesses in <b>SDM.</b> <b>The</b> study concludes with a series of recommendations for an effective public participation process in poverty alleviation programmes for communities, and for further research.
