5|$|The {{economic}} policies of Modi's government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, {{based on a}} neoliberal framework. Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways. Other reforms included removing many of the country's labour laws, {{to make it harder}} for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them. These reforms met with support from institutions such as the World Bank, but opposition from scholars within the country. The labour laws also drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the BJP. The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, stated that the reforms would hurt labourers by making it easier for corporations to exploit them. In his first budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley promised to gradually reduce the <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficit</b> from 4.1 percent to 3 percent over two years, and to divest from shares in public banks. Over Modi's first year in office, the Indian GDP grew at a rate of 7.5 percent, making it the world's fastest-growing large economy.|$|E

Over Modi's first year in office, the Indian GDP grew at a rate of 7.5%, making it the fastest growing large economy. This was basis a revised formula introduced a year after he took office, which surprised a lot of economists. However, this rate of growth had fallen significantly to 6.1%, even by the revised metric, by his third year in office. This fall has been blamed on the exercise of demonetisation of currency.|$|E
2500|$|In 1835 the Tokugawa {{government}} started minting copper 100 mon named Tenpō Tsūhō (Kyūjitai: 天保通寶 Shinjitai: 天保通宝) {{as a way}} {{to solve}} its <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficit,</b> as the coin contained only 5½ as much copper as a 1 mon Kan'ei tsūhō this eventually lead to inflation. This was later followed by the Satsuma Domain issuing a 100 mon coin of their own in 1862 to supposedly produce currency for the Ryukyu Kingdom, while in reality doing it to boost their own economy. These Ryūkyū Tsūhō (琉球通寳) coins eventually started circulating in other provinces as well.|$|E
30|$|Nevertheless, {{there are}} several clues from the results to {{cast doubt on the}} {{effectiveness}} of this mechanism. To begin with, the magnitude of the coefficient for <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits</b> decreased significantly from the period of 2007 – 2013 to 2009 – 2013. This probably shows that the marginal effect of the central government’s spending has diminished over time. In addition, when the endogeneity of economy was mitigated, the coefficient for <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits</b> also decreased, meaning that the effect of <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits</b> tends to be overestimated due to the noises posed by economic factors. These results appear to confirm some criticisms with central transfers in China, which argue that transfers were not properly targeted.|$|R
30|$|For {{the period}} between 2007 and 2013, {{coefficients}} for the real per capita <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits,</b> economy, and dependency rate of the aged are all significant at the 1 % significance level. The coefficient for real per capita <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits</b> is 0.042, meaning that increasing 1000 yuan for real per capita <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits</b> would lead to 42 yuan more real per capita GHE. The coefficient for economy is 125. This indicates that increasing one unit of economy would contribute to 125 yuan more real per capita GHE. The coefficient for the dependency rate of the aged is 770, which suggests that an increase of one percentage point of the dependency rate of the aged is associated with 8 yuan more real per capita GHE. Compared to {{the model for the}} years between 2007 and 2013, the corresponding model for {{the period between}} 2009 and 2013 yielded similar results. Still, the coefficients for the real per capita <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits,</b> economy, and dependency rate of the aged are the three variables that are significant, the difference being that the coefficient for economy is no longer significant at the 1 % significance level but instead at the 5 % significance level. The coefficient for real per capita <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits</b> dropped from 0.042 to 0.031, indicating that the influence of <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits</b> has decreased since 2009. On the other hand, the magnitude of the coefficients for the economy and dependency rate of the aged both improved. A one-unit increase of economy would this time lead to 145 yuan more real per capita GHE, and increasing one percentage point of the dependency rate of the aged would mean 9 yuan more real per capita GHE.|$|R
30|$|Based {{on a panel}} dataset for Chinese provinces between 2007 and 2013, {{this study}} {{examined}} the key explanatory variables of provincial GHE. Different from previous research, a range of socio-economic indicators were factored before any regression analysis was performed to address the high correlation between variables, thereby ameliorating the measurement. The panel data regression analysis shows that real per capita <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits</b> and economic development are the most important determinants of real per capita provincial GHE. More specifically, it was found that increasing 1000 yuan real per capita <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits</b> would lead to 34 yuan more real per capita GHE; a one-unit increase in the economy was associated with 249 yuan higher real per capita GHE; and a one-unit increase in the industrial structure was expected to decrease the real per capita GHE by 33 yuan. A comparison of these coefficients showed that the influence of economic development is much larger than that of <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits.</b> Furthermore, the comparison between the periods of 2007 – 2013 and 2009 – 2013 revealed an even influence of economic development and a diminishing effect of <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits,</b> indicating that the central government’s funding efforts have probably diminished over time.|$|R
2500|$|During the 1979 {{election}} campaign, Clark {{had promised}} to cut taxes to stimulate the economy.

[...] Romanow, who inherited a $14 billion debt from the previous Conservative government, eliminated the annual <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficit</b> by closing hospitals, cutting services and raising taxes. Romanow's government also {{had the benefit of}} substantially lower interest rates at a national level than did his predecessor in the 1980s. [...] The Romanow NDP explained the cutbacks to the left wing of the party by claiming Romanow's range of political action was limited by the large debt accumulated by previous governments.|$|E
50|$|The {{realm of}} {{environmentalism}} {{is affected by}} Jordan's failing taxation system. In 2012, Jordan had a <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficit</b> of U$1.2 billion. The Jordanian government took some austerity measurements, such as lowering subsidies on commodities that are not vital for the average Jordanian and increasing state revenues through the Income Tax Law. These measurements {{were put in place}} in order to control the country's <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficit.</b> In the same year, Jordan received the third highest amount of aid from the United States per capita, behind Israel and Afghanistan.|$|E
30|$|Given that {{economy and}} <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits</b> are both key {{determinants}} of provincial GHE, {{it is interesting}} to make a comparison of the magnitude of the two coefficients. For economy, the average annual increase ranged from 0.11 to 0.29 across different provinces (Qinghai and Tibet excluded). The coefficient of 249 indicates that economy could explain 27 - to 72 -yuan average annual difference in real per capita GHE. In comparison, the average annual increase in real per capita <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits</b> ranged from 118 to 192 yuan (Qinghai and Tibet excluded). The coefficient of 0.034 means that real per capita <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits</b> could potentially explain 4 - to 7 -yuan increase in average annual difference in real per capita GHE. The influence of economic development is much more significant than that of <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits.</b> This means that despite the central government’s efforts, GHE is still largely determined by economic development: richer provinces can enjoy a higher level of GHE. Moreover, a comparison of the coefficients for the overall period and the post- 2009 period shows a worrisome picture. The magnitude of the coefficient for economy became even larger over time, suggesting that the impact of economic development was intensified.|$|R
30|$|Key {{determinants}} of provincial GHE in China include the real per capita <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits,</b> economy, and industrial structure (two factors composed from an exploratory factor analysis). Increasing 1000 yuan real per capita <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits</b> {{was expected to}} increase the real per capita GHE by 34 yuan. A one-unit increase in the economy {{was associated with a}} 249 yuan higher real per capita GHE, while a one-unit increase in the industrial structure was expected to decrease the real per capita GHE by 33 yuan.|$|R
30|$|This study {{discovered}} that increasing 1000 yuan real per capita <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits</b> {{would lead to}} 34 yuan more real per capita GHE for the period between 2007 and 2013. This means that the less capable a province is in financing its expenditures from its own revenue, the more it spends on health, which is possible because these deficits should have been filled by central transfers to compensate for any gap. In other words, provinces with larger <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits</b> receive more money from the central government, which is then spent on province-level GHE. In this, the central government subsidizes high deficit province health expenditures.|$|R

30|$|One {{problem with}} the {{regression}} results is potential endogeneity due to reversed causality. GHE can potentially enlarge <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits</b> and promote the economy through the enhancement of human capital. In other words, real per capita <b>budgetary</b> <b>deficits</b> and economy are potentially endogenous. To test for this, endogeneity tests were conducted. This study then followed Wu and Lin (2012)’s and Checherita and Rother (2010)’s approach by adopting the generalized method of moments estimators and using lag regressors as instruments to mitigate the possibility of reversed causation. 6 A series of standard tests, including those for under-identification, weak identification, and over-identification, were carried out to test the appropriateness of models.|$|R
