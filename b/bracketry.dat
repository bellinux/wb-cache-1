50|$|The Horton Bay General Store is a {{rectangular}} gable-front two-story frame Late Victorian commercial building, clad in clapboard, on a fieldstone foundation. It has a symmetrical, falsefront facade with an upper cornice containing a central triangular pediment. The storefront contains a centrally located, recessed doorway flanked by display windows. A storefront cornice with supporting <b>bracketry</b> {{is located at}} the point where the porch roof meets the facade.|$|E
50|$|The {{main house}} is a two-story, five-bay frame {{building}} on a raised fieldstone foundation. The gabled metallic roof has cornice returns and is pierced by four chimneys at the corners. The eastern (front) facade has a full-length flat-roofed veranda with cornice <b>bracketry</b> and scroll-sawn segmentally-arched knee braces. Small Palladian windows {{are located in the}} gable apexes on the north and south, with two quarter-round attic windows on either side.|$|E

5000|$|Few {{alterations}} {{took place}} to the station upon transfer to the Underground. Barkingside station is a [...] "Grade II" [...] listed building, marking it as a structure of architectural significance. Probably designed {{under the direction of}} W. N. Ashbee, the GER architect, it is dominated by a substantial brick building, surmounted by a cupola. The interior is notable for the fine hammerbeam roof to the ticket hall. Both platforms retain the ornate canopies with the [...] "GER" [...] initials still visible in the <b>bracketry.</b>|$|E
50|$|All 700 series {{telephone}} instruments {{came with}} at least one knockout forward of the switchooks, for installing bell on/bell off switches for instance. Some, however, the Tele. 710, came with four smaller knockouts and, if you looked inside the case, two circular ones too, top right and left of the dial aperture. These, along with a host of unused holes and <b>bracketry,</b> on the chassis, were a source of mystery for a time. Until, that is, the small business successor to the 300 series, House Exchange System 1 was revealed. The 700 series, HES 3.|$|E
40|$|The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) {{oxidizer}} tank {{is developed}} based on adaptations to a flight-proven tank design. The modifications include removal of an elastomeric diaphragm and {{elimination of the}} diaphragm retaining features, addition of an outlet tube near the tank equator, addition of an internal vortex suppressor {{at the entrance of}} the outlet tube, and added <b>bracketry</b> to the external tube stubs. Qualification of this tank is based on similarity to the flight qualified tank and by analysis. The updated stress and fracture mechanics analyses showed large positive margins of safety for this tank...|$|E
40|$|An {{independent}} study {{was performed to}} assess the pre-launch thermally induced stresses in the Space Shuttle External Tank Bipod closeout and Ice/Frost ramps (IFRs). Finite element models with various levels of detail were built that included {{the three types of}} foam (BX- 265, NCFI 24 - 124, and PDL 1034) and the underlying structure and <b>bracketry.</b> Temperature profiles generated by the thermal analyses were input to the structural models to calculate the stress levels. An area of high stress in the Bipod closeout was found along the aluminum tank wall near the phenolic insulator and along the phenolic insulator itself. This area of high stress might be prone to cracking and possible delamination. There is a small region of slightly increased stress in the NCFI 24 - 124 foam near its joint with the Bipod closeout BX- 265 foam. The calculated stresses in the NCFI 24 - 124 acreage foam are highest at the NCFI 24 - 124 /PDL 1034 /tank wall interface under the LO 2 and LH 2 IFRs. The highest calculated stresses in the LH 2 NCFI 24 - 124 foam are higher than in similar locations in the LO 2 IFR. This finding is consistent with the dissection results of IFRs on ET- 120...|$|E
40|$|A {{dry sump}} {{lubrication}} {{system for a}} Formula SAE race car was designed and manufactured {{in order to gain}} the various advantages this type of system affords. A dry sump system stores oil in an external tank and pumps it between the engine and tank as needed. This allows for a shallower oil pan, which permits lower engine placement. This lower placement improves handling through a lower center of gravity. Additionally, the highly stressed racing engine, a Honda CBR 600 F 4 i, receives more constant lubrication than a conventional wet sump system. The system included design of a new pan, tank and the associated <b>bracketry</b> and hoses that are needed to make the system functional. The design of the system stressed reliability while keeping an eye on weight to minimize it whenever possible. Detailed analysis and the methodology driving the design choices are presented here along with simple dry sump theory. This document serves as the roadmap through the design of the first dry sump system on an MIT FSAE car. It should prove beneficial to the team when the official design report is created for the competition. Lastly, it will help assist future members who certainly aim to refine the package in subsequent years to make it smaller, cheaper, lighter, more reliable and simply better performing overall. by Ehsan Farkhondeh.
