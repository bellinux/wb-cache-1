40|$|Issue: Contamination {{limits the}} {{ultimate}} marketability {{of the full}} range of PET plastic containers collected by local recycling programs. Contamination reduces the value of recyclable PET; it hinders processing and causes unproductive downtime and clean-up expenses for PET processors, reclaimers and end-users; and, it results in unnecessary manufacturing waste from the PET recycling process. Background: Intermediate plastic processors take in baled (and in some cases loose) plastic containers that have been separated from other recycable materials at MRFs, buyback or drop-off centers. Intermediate processors then granulate the containers for sale as “dirty regrind ” to reclaimers and end-users. In most cases, plastic intermediate processors take in loose plastic bottles and produce <b>baled</b> <b>plastics</b> for sale to plastic recycling facilities (PRFs), reclaimers or end-users. Most PRFs are designed to separate plastics into their individual resin categories (if they accept <b>bales</b> of mixed <b>plastic</b> bottles), and then further separate each plastic resin type by color or other market specification parameters. These color segregated plastic resins are then fed into granulators at PRFs or reclaimers to produce dirty regrind. Another major function of the plastics intermediat...|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the best}} quality silage ever made has come from round <b>bales</b> sealed in <b>plastic.</b> On the other hand, {{some of the worst}} silage that I have ever seen {{likewise}} came from round <b>bales</b> in <b>plastic.</b> These extremes in quality are related to procedural techniques for putting up round bale silage and problems that can occur during storage. If proper techniques are followed, excellent quality silage can be produced, especially from late summer and fall cuttings. But if bales are not managed properly, it can be a disaster resulting in total loss of the silage. It may be easier to preserve hay crop silage in upright, trench and bunker silos than in large <b>bales</b> sealed in <b>plastic.</b> Plastic is much more susceptible to air leaks and oxygen infiltration than concrete or steel, so the ease of maintaining an oxygen-free storage environment is much less for <b>bales</b> surrounded by <b>plastic</b> than for conventional silos. The round bale silage system, sometimes referred to as `balage', has a number of advantages over hay and conventional silage systems: 1. Substantially reduces the risk of weather damage to the forage compared with a hay system. 2. Provides flexibility as the baler can be used for both hay and silage.

The cotton lint was compressed in an MTS machine to a predetermined density, and the resilient forces induced by the cotton lint after being compressed were measured. Finite element analysis was used to model force on cotton bale ties, and determine the magnitude of the resilient forces on the bale ties. The nodal forces on the bale tie material were evaluated for three different bale tie materials to determine if bale tie breakage would occur. Young's modulus of bulk lint cotton was found to be 9 MPa and the Poisson's ratio was 0. 1, while 12 MPa was recorded for the shear modulus.

40|$|This study {{examines}} harvesting systems and presents conclusions on selection of machines for harvesting silage for dairy cows. Achieving {{a high quality}} cut of forage requires a high machine capacity and harvesting {{must be carried out}} at the optimal time with respect to plant growth stage. Therefore calculation of timeliness costs, which are determined by the time and capacity of harvesting, formed {{an important part of the}} study. These calculations require timeliness factors that describe the losses for each day by which harvest is delayed after the date of maximum economic crop value. The timeliness factors were calculated for each cut from data on changes in yield and quality of cuts during the harvest period. Harvesting cost calculations were based on a precision chop forage trailer, a precision chop forage harvester with separate transport trailers and a round baler with integral wrapping. Cost calculations were carried out for three different sizes of machine chain (small (S), medium (M) and large (L)) for each harvest system. The operations included were mowingconditioning, harvesting in the field, transport to storage and loading and packing into a bunker silo. Harvesting costs included the cost of machines, labour and timeliness. In addition, ensiling costs such as <b>bale</b> <b>plastic</b> and the investment, interest and maintenance cost for the bunker silo or the storage area for round bales were included when comparing the harvesting systems. Calculations were made for a three-cut system in conventional (CONV) and organic (ORG) forage production in southern Sweden (Gss) and central Sweden (Ss). When timeliness costs were not considered there was a risk of too low a harvest capacity being chosen. The effect of including timeliness costs when calculating harvesting costs increased with the forage area harvested, since a larger forage area increased the duration of harvest. Table S 1 shows harvesting and ensiling costs with 1 km transport distance for 70 hectares of forage in conventional production and 90 hectares in organic production in central Sweden. At short transport distances (1 km), the precision chop forage trailer and the precision chop forage harvester with separate transport trailers had similar harvesting and ensiling costs, while those for round baling were somewhat higher. The precision chop forage harvester with 2 or 3 transport trailers resulted in the lowest costs at 2 - 7 km transport distance. At longer transport distances (> 7 km), the round baler was the cheapest of the harvesting systems studied here. As regards machine capacity, it is clear from Figure S 1 that to minimise harvesting costs the smallest machine chain should be used for forage areas less than 60 ha, whereas when the forage area exceeds 90 ha the largest machine chain should be chosen. In the 60 - 90 ha forage area range, there was little difference in costs between the S, M and L machine chains. For harvest with round bales only the size of the mower-conditioner varied between the machine chains and the largest machine chain had the lowest harvest costs for all forage areas. Machine cooperatives are a good way to lower harvesting costs since for smaller forage areas in particular, increased annual use of the machines decreases the machine costs and allows larger machines to be used to greater capacity. To avoid high timeliness costs it is important that cuts are performed at the optimal time...|$|R

40|$|A recent {{experimental}} study on fault gouges prepared from limestone samples {{taken from the}} Longmen Shan Fault Zone, which hosted the Great Wenchuan Earthquake of 2008, showed unstable, velocity weakening slip in low velocity experiments performed at temperatures of 100 - 150 °C but stable, velocity strengthening slip at lower temperatures. Velocity weakening {{is the process of}} shear strength reduction with increasing sliding velocities and is a requirement for seismogenesis. The frictional properties were studied macroscopically with help of the Rate and State dependent Friction law. However, the resulting data do not enable identification of the microphysical processes which cause velocity weakening in the limestone gouge. To determine the process causing velocity weakening, the simulated fault gouge has been examined under the light and electron microscope, with magnifications ranging from 5 to 150. 000 times. Calcite twins and fractures were observed and the density of these structures seems to increase with temperature. The 150 °C limestone sample shows a more chaotic microstructure, with the R-shear bands being less common, broader and less recognizable compared to the 25 °C- 100 °C sheared limestone gouges. Calcite twinning is also very common in the high temperature experiment. Quantitative analysis of the grain size distribution shows that the smallest grain sizes (minimum grain size ~ 50 nm) barely change whereas large polycrystalline clusters (~ 15 µm) do show a decrease in size. Comparison of the mechanical and microstructural data with previous microphysical models for the velocity dependence of slip suggests that possible microphysical reasons for velocity weakening includes competition between frictional viscous flow, dilatation, -and compaction due to granular rearrangement plus pressure solution and/or minor crystal <b>plastic</b> flow (<b>twinning).</b> The very small grain size developed in the samples might speed up processes like diffusion, allowing such mechanisms to control slip at relatively high rates...|$|R
40|$|Molecular Dynamics {{techniques}} {{were used to}} simulate Cu nanoparticle arrays at different temperatures. New potential was modified to provide the reliable representation of Cu nanoparticle systems. Different sets of simulation arrays were used to study the different stages of nanoscale sintering. The results are summarized as follows: (1) Three new mechanisms were found to contribute significantly to the early stage sintering. They are plastic deformation, mechanical rotation and amorphisation-recrystallization. Mechanical rotation, caused by large atomic forces relative to the particle masses, appeared to be almost independent of temperature. Plastic deformation was found to involved via dislocation generation and transmission and appeared almost athermal as well. Amorphisation of sub-critical grains was found to significantly increase the diffusion rates in the affected regions and dramatically accelerate the sintering kinetics and grain boundary kinetics. A high-speed <b>plastic</b> deformation, <b>twinning,</b> {{was found in the}} nanosphere sintering and resulted in sintered clusters with multiply twinned particles. (2) Only two of the six classical mechanisms (surface diffusion and grain boundary diffusion) were found to be important for nanoscale sintering. However, the processes were considerably accelerated by strong interatomic attractions, and depended only weakly on temperature. These “force-driven” diffusions are different from the standard “random walk” ones, and need to be treated quite differently. (3) Large array simulations are made possible by using pressure clamp technique. The effect of grain size distribution, temperature and pressure were investigated. Residual pores were found playing important role in fully densification. (4) Classical sintering laws, such as Herring 2 ̆ 7 s law, were found invalid to describe nanoscale sintering due to the facts that a series of mechanisms co-exists and come intro play in an overlapping manner {{in a short period of}} time. (5) Sintering Diagrams, estimated from the simulation results, appear to be differently from the ones that are predicted by the classical theory. ...|$|R

A new intrinsic length-scale model is presented based on the profile of the residual indentation and geometrically necessary dislocation theory...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{martensitic}} transformation {{behavior of a}} Mo-bearing γ-TiAl based alloy was investigated. Therefore, a homogenization treatment within the single β-phase field region followed by water quenching has been carried out, whereby {{the majority of the}} disordered β-phase transforms into hexagonal α$_ 2 $′-martensite during cooling. Since the β to α transformation in the intermetallic β-solidifying Ti– 44 Al– 3 Mo– 0. 1 B alloy (at%) occurs at very high temperatures causing enhanced diffusional processes, a very locally diffusion-controlled transformation together with a displacive, hence purely martensitic transformation take place. This work investigates the displacive martensite formation in the high-temperature regime using state-of-the-art experimental methods as well as modelling concepts from the phenomenological theory of martensite crystallography. The high temperature at which the transformation takes place suggests the preference of <b>plastic</b> slip over <b>twinning.</b> This fact has also been verified by transmission electron microscopy, as no twinning has been observed after generation of single martensite variants forming an invariant interface plane with the initial β-lattice. Such invariant interfaces are formally possible according to the phenomenological theory of martensite crystallography, if the Bain strains of the martensite variants are superimposed by additional simple shear...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSome Fe-based alloys {{containing}} Mn exhibit characteristic {{plastic deformation}} modes such as twin induced plasticity (TWIP) and transformation induced plasticity (TRIP). In this study, microstructural changes induced by a tensile test in polycrystalline Fe- 25 %Mn- 0. 6 %C alloys exhibiting TWIP were characterized. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and two-dimensional (2 D) X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements using synchrotron radiation {{were carried out}} to characterize the microstructure and crystallographic orientation of the polycrystalline alloy samples. The samples were deformed by 10 %, 30 %, and 60 % in a tensile test. The EBSD results showed that deformation twins appeared to form preferentially in grains with large Schmid factors for twinning, and these had an orientation of nearly - parallel to the tensile direction. In addition to <b>twinning,</b> <b>plastic</b> deformation by dislocation slip was also observed {{in the interior of}} grains and near grain boundaries. In the polycrystalline sample, the heterogeneous strain by twinning and dislocation slip evolved overall with tensile strain. The 2 D-XRD results also indicated that dislocation slip as well as twinning occurs in tensile deformed samples, and the contribution of twinning and dislocation slip in grains depends on tensile strain. Therefore, multiple plastic deformation modes consisting of different deformation twins and dislocation slips are attributed to large elongation in Fe-Mn-C alloys...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the experiment were to examine whether high moisture maize grain (HMM) is superior to low moisture maize grain (LMM) as supplement to alfalfa haylage (Medicago sativa L.) (AH). The effects of HMM and LMM supplementation to AH were studied on feed intake, water intake and dry matter (DM) digestibility in wether sheep. Alfalfa was harvested {{at the beginning of}} flowering and ensiled into round <b>bales</b> wrapped with <b>plastic.</b> The average DM and crude protein (CP) concentration of AH was 534. 7 g kg- 1 fresh sample and 141 g kg- 1 DM, respectively. The average DM content (g kg- 1 fresh sample) of HMM and LMM were 795. 9 and 915. 1 g kg- 1 fresh sample, respectively, while the average CP concentration (g kg- 1 DM) were 116. 8 and 106. 0, respectively. The study consisted of five feeding treatments incorporating AH only and AH supplemented with 5 or 10 g HMM or LMM d- 1 kg- 1 wether body weight. The inclusion of HMM (5 or 10 g kg- 1 body weight d- 1) into AH based ration resulted in higher diet DM digestibility (P< 0. 05) in comparison with LMM inclusion (5 or 10 g kg- 1 body weight d- 1). Higher daily fresh matter intake (FMI) (P< 0. 05), dry matter intake (DMI) (P< 0. 05) and water intake (P< 0. 05) was achieved with LMM inclusion in comparison with HMM inclusion. The conclusion was that HMM is superior over LMM as supplement to AH in terms of DM digestibility, while LMM has advantages over HMM in the intake characteristics measured...|$|R
