5000|$|Velocette's Director, Eugene Goodman, planned an {{innovative}} and radical design that {{would appeal to}} a new market that needed cheap, clean and reliable transport. Designer Charles Udall developed the Velocette LE as a [...] "conceived-as-a-whole" [...] design, with engine, gearbox, drive shaft and <b>bevel</b> <b>box</b> in a single unit to do a specific job.|$|E
50|$|H-drives {{do not use}} axles {{but rather}} {{individual}} wheel stations, usually carried on a punt chassis. A single differential splits the drive into separate left and right drive shafts, which each run fore and aft inside the bottom corners of the chassis. At each wheel station a <b>bevel</b> <b>box</b> drives the half shaft out to the wheel.|$|E
50|$|The Brough Superior Austin Four in the National Motorcycle Museum (UK) is {{actually}} {{a replica of the}} motorcycle that was scrapped in Wales. Built by enthusiast Albert Wallis, who started with a few spare parts including a rear <b>bevel</b> <b>box</b> casting, and a pair of original radiators, it was completed with a standard Austin 7 engine and gearbox.|$|E
50|$|As {{relatively}} small four-wheeled vehicles, these used a simplified {{layout of the}} H-drive. A single wide casing housed the differential and transfer box, with four articulated driveshafts running to <b>bevel</b> gear <b>boxes</b> inboard of each wheel. The use of <b>bevel</b> <b>boxes,</b> rather than DAF's worm gears, required the final drive reduction {{to be placed in}} the hubs, using an epicyclic reduction in each hub. This had the advantage of reducing torque in the driveshafts, allowing their unsprung weight to be made lighter.|$|R
50|$|Saracen used {{an almost}} {{identical}} chassis and drivetrain to Saladin, although {{the engine was}} relocated from the rear {{to the front of}} the vehicle. The transmission used a 5-speed Wilson preselector gearbox with a fluid flywheel. Reverse gear was provided within the transfer box, allowing all five gears in either direction. The centre <b>bevel</b> <b>boxes</b> were included within the transfer box housing and had a slight overdrive to the drive shafts fore and aft. Each wheel station used double wishbones and torsion bars for suspension with four (three on the centre stations) shock absorbers. Steering was applied to the centre wheels and a lever arrangement moved the front wheels by a proportionately larger amount.|$|R
50|$|This {{system and}} its {{drawbacks}} are probably best known through the Alvis FV600 chassis and the Stalwart and family. As well as the <b>bevel</b> <b>boxes</b> in the hull, these used an epicyclic hub gear. Standard operating instructions recommend that after travelling some miles on firm ground, the vehicle should be bounced over a kerb or railway sleeper to lift wheels clear of the ground, one-by-one, {{to allow them to}} spring back and release the windup. Excess windup could easily lead to a broken gear in the bevel or hub gearboxes. To indicate this, white lines were painted across the ends of the hubs. Normally the lines should be parallel but as windup occurred they would become misaligned, indicating the need to release this.|$|R
50|$|Continued {{expansion}} in the steering product market followed with the introduction in 1995 of the Pailton Mitre box or <b>Bevel</b> <b>box,</b> a device to allow 90 degree changes in direction of the steering input shaft with low backlash and no universal joint phasing allowing the steering box to be positioned in a place more favourable to the steering gear for actuation, while still placing the steering column {{in the best position}} for the driver.|$|E
50|$|H-drives {{do not use}} axles {{but rather}} {{individual}} wheel stations, carried on a punt or backbone chassis. A single differential splits the drive into separate left and right drive shafts, which each run fore and aft inside the bottom corners of the chassis. At each wheel station a <b>bevel</b> <b>box</b> drives the half shaft out to the wheel. Unlike a typical transfer box for permanent four-wheel drive, there is no differential action front-to-back.|$|E
50|$|The engine drove, via a {{multiple}} dry-plate clutch, a four-speed gearbox. It had no synchromesh and switching between gears without excessive noise {{was a challenge}} to the driver. A propeller shaft connected the gearbox to a <b>bevel</b> <b>box</b> {{at the end of the}} tank which divided the power to a separate epicyclic gear for each track. These gears automatically provided extra emergency torsion to the normal first and second gear if the vehicle suddenly slowed down due to an obstacle or soft ground.|$|E

50|$|Fitted with {{coil spring}} {{suspension}} and drum brakes, the AML lacks hydraulic assist on either brakes or steering; only front wheels steer. Consequently, {{the steering wheel}} requires considerable strength to turn while the vehicle is in motion - while stationary it remains effectively locked. Much like the Ferret, rear wheel drive is transmitted directly to epicyclic hub reduction gears, also known as <b>bevel</b> <b>boxes.</b> The motor and gearbox have been harnessed via a centrifugal clutch with electromagnetic control, {{eliminating the need for}} a clutch pedal. This type of clutch is automatically engaged by gripping the knob of the gearshift lever, which is located behind the driver's seat in the hull floor. The gearbox assembly consists of two separate gearboxes, one for high and the other for low gear. The low-range gearbox is designed for off-road use and has a reverse gear and a top gear, while the high-range box is for operation on roads and has three low gears and one overdrive. There is a hydraulic dual-circuit handbrake operating on the gearbox output shaft.|$|R
50|$|The United States Navy {{purchased}} 12 Schwartzkopff torpedoes in 1898, this naval service's one {{and only}} acquisition of the Schwartzkopff product. As delivered to the United States Navy, the Schwartzkopff torpedo was constructed in eight sections: war nose, warhead, immersion chamber, air flask, engine room, after body, <b>bevel</b> gear <b>box</b> and tail. However, it was typically dismantled and assembled into four parts: the head, immersion chamber, air flask and after body. All the sections were manufactured out of bronze with the air flask made of a special grade to withstand the internal pressure of 90 atmospheres per square inch.|$|R
50|$|The {{layout of}} the H-drive {{drivetrain}} contributed greatly to its low silhouette, agility and - an important consideration in any vehicle used in the reconnaissance role, an exceptionally quiet engine and running gear. Power was led forward to a centrally-located transfer box and single differential driving separate left and right hand shafts, each in turn running forwards and back to a <b>bevel</b> <b>box</b> powering each wheels. This extremely space-efficient layout resulted in a low-slung vehicle with a flat plate that allowed the Dingo to slide across uneven ground, but this feature made the Dingo extremely vulnerable to mines.|$|E
5000|$|After the Second World War, {{the company}} sought to capture what it {{saw as a}} {{developing}} need for personal transport and created the LE model [...] (for [...] "Little Engine"). This was a 149 cc water-cooled flat-twin with side valves, a pressed steel frame, telescopic forks and a swingarm. Velocette's Director, Eugene Goodman, planned an innovative and radical design that would appeal to a new market that needed cheap, clean and reliable transport. Designer Charles Udall developed the Velocette LE as a [...] "conceived-as-a-whole" [...] design, with engine, gearbox, drive shaft and <b>bevel</b> <b>box</b> in a single unit to do a specific job. It was sophisticated and expensive. Unfortunately it proved less successful than the firm had hoped and, although it became Veloce's best selling model ever, the high tooling costs for this all-new machine were barely recouped.|$|E
40|$|In an {{experimental}} study {{the performance of}} flood lubrication in <b>bevel</b> gear <b>boxes</b> has been characterized. At a peripheral velocity of 20 - 60 m/s the dependence of frictional loss, oil and gear temperatures on the operation parameters specific load, dripping depth, oil additices and oil supply conditions have been investigated. It is demonstrated that flood lubrication of bevel gears represents already at low dipping depth a lubrication method reliable in service {{as long as a}} balanced heat flow is maintained by forced cooling. A limiting peripheral velocity has not been detected in this study.

5000|$|However, {{this system}} caused 'wind up' in the {{transmission}} (inter-component stress) {{as all the}} wheels were forced to rotate at the same speed, which during cornering is impossible. This led to rapid wear and breakage of the <b>bevel</b> gear <b>boxes</b> if the vehicle was used on firm surfaces, such as tarmac or concrete [...] - [...] in off-road conditions, the natural 'slip' of a loose surface, such as mud or gravel reduced 'wind up'. This problem is of special concern for modern-day enthusiast Stalwart owners [...] - [...] to get a vehicle to a show either requires moving it by low-loader or driving it on the road, risking damage to the transmission. Alternatively, {{the front and rear}} driveshafts could be removed, eliminating windup at the expense of off-road capability.|$|R
50|$|The first Boss Hosses offered {{included}} a one-speed manual transmission {{with a standard}} motorcycle hand clutch assisted by a Datsun B210 brake vacuum booster. The bikes used a standard ten-spline 12 in disc clutch plate hooked to a Curtis spiral <b>bevel</b> gear <b>box</b> with a Chevrolet input shaft and a -inch output shaft that had an attached sprocket. The first bikes were chain driven but changed to 1.5 in Dayton belts in the early 1990s. The ratio of the gear box used was 1.53:1. In 1999, a one-speed semi-automatic transmission was available for the motorcycles that utilized a torque converter and a pump {{with a set of}} clutch plates and steels basically added to the previous design gearbox, which worked very well. In 2001, a two-speed semi-automatic transmission with overdrive became standard with a heel-toe shifter and a reverse gear. Boss Hoss trikes have always offered a three-speed semi-automatic transmission with a real reverse gear.|$|R
