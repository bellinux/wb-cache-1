5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid {{to come out and}} <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> their identity. Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E
5|$|In a {{telephone}} interview with Today's Zaman, in 2009, Finkelstein stated:I think Israel, {{as a number of}} commentators pointed out, is becoming an insane state. And we have to <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> that. While {{the rest of the world}} wants peace, Europe wants peace, the US wants peace, but this state wants war, war and war. In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.|$|E
25|$|Sourav Ganguly (51) {{given out}} by Mark Benson – While the TV {{evidence}} was inconclusive {{as to the}} correctness of the decision, {{the manner in which}} it was delivered has generated controversy. Sourav Ganguly edged the ball to Michael Clarke at slip who was engulfed by his team-mates in celebration of an apparent catch. Umpire Benson appeared unsure as to whether it carried and instead of referring to third umpire asked captain Ricky Ponting for clarification. There was a prior agreement between the teams that the fielders would <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> whether the catch had carried. Ponting, having already consulted Clarke about the validity of the catch, raised his finger, telling the umpire that he thought the catch was cleanly taken.|$|E

2500|$|His {{daughter}} Elizabeth declared: [...] "In true editorial fashion, he <b>was</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> {{the quality}} of his own writing. He felt it was fair to middling at best. He always knew that his great talent was as an editor." ...|$|R
25|$|Becoming desperate, Elle and Sage visit Elle's ex-husband Karl, whom Elle has {{not seen}} in decades. She tells him she needs to borrow the money for rent, and he {{requests}} a kiss in return. This leads to an argument over how Elle ended their relationship, but when she pleads with him, he agrees {{to hand over the}} cash. When he asks her to <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> the reason for needing the money, she tells him that Sage needs an abortion, and Karl becomes angry and emotional. Elle once aborted his child without telling him, yet went on to give birth to a baby born from a one-night stand. She explains that she wanted a child but not a husband, and Karl angrily insists he will not pay for an abortion.|$|E
500|$|... {{has all of}} me in it. I {{never did}} my records like that before. I got to choose the music, but this time around it was, like, I'd sit down and think: 'What {{happened}} to me yesterday? What happened to me today?' and just write. It was very therapeutic, in a way. And easy – I was shocked at {{how easy it was}} to <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> yourself and things that affect you. It is a dance record, but I wanted it to be serious. I wanted to talk about serious things, but do it in a not-so-serious way, with music that makes you want to get up and dance.|$|E
500|$|Iain Glen, who has portrayed Jorah Mormont {{since the}} {{beginning}} of the series, also spoke about his participation in the episode, with his farewell to Daenerys Targaryen, noting [...] "They've got a worried actor on their hands. For any actor on the show, most of the time we're just thinking, [...] "Please keep me alive!" [...] I've been very lucky to be a part of the show, right back to the pilot. If I go out in the madness of greyscale, then I'll have thought I've done very well. It's been a complete treat to be a part of the show. They're a lovely group of people. But the greyscale has definitely got this actor worried, I'll <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Trenyce {{was also}} found to have been arrested on felony theft charge, however Nigel Lythgoe {{considered}} her offence to be minor and one which she has <b>been</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about,</b> therefore [...] "warranted no concern regarding her participation in the show." ...|$|R

[...] "Who {{wants to}} give up a very {{agreeable}} profession and enter upon a career of bloodshed, abandon all one's habits, and lose most of one's friends? No, we <b>are</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> that, at any rate! Germany may be enjoying this war. We aren't." ...|$|R
500|$|Boyack {{said that}} she would be a [...] "listening leader" [...] who would tackle funding {{shortfalls}} in the National Health Service (NHS) and local government. She also {{said that she}} would publish 100 new ideas aimed at improving lives after meeting people during her campaign. Positioning herself as a unifying candidate who would make the party [...] "fit for purpose", she called for [...] "bold and radical" [...] new approaches to policy, which would require Labour to <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> funding crises in local government and health. She pledged that, if elected, she would work with the SNP government when she felt it was {{in the best interest of}} Scotland to do so, but said Labour would also be an effective opposition, holding the government to account when necessary.|$|E
500|$|Scholar Joanne M. Braxton sees Caged Bird as [...] "the fully {{developed}} black female autobiographical form {{that began to}} emerge in the 1940s and 1950s". [...] The book presents themes that are common in autobiography by Black American women: a celebration of Black motherhood; a criticism of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition. Angelou introduces a unique point of view in American autobiography by revealing her life story through a narrator who is a Black female from the South, at some points a child, and other points a mother. Writer Hilton Als calls Angelou one of the [...] "pioneers of self-exposure", willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices. For example, Angelou was worried about her readers' reactions to her disclosure in her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name, that she was a prostitute. [...] She went through with it, anyway, after her husband Paul Du Feu advised her to <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|E
500|$|Wings for My Flight {{was first}} {{published}} in 1991 in hardcover by Addison-Wesley. Houle later wrote a short story titled [...] "Albert" [...] that was adapted from Wings for My Flight, focusing on Albert and Leopold's first attempts at flying. The story was published in the May 1996 issue of the children's magazine Cricket. Wings for My Flight was republished, this time in paperback, in 1999 by Pruett Publishing. This edition included a foreword by Robert Michael Pyle and a new preface and epilogue by Houle. In 2014, the book was updated and republished again by University of New Mexico Press. The updated edition contained photographs of the Chimney Rock landscape, as well as a preface by Houle that addressed the recovery of the peregrine falcon population since the book {{was first published}} in 1991. Houle highlighted the 1972 agricultural prohibition of DDT, which was the chemical primarily responsible for the peregrine decline; the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which allowed the pursuit of wildlife conservation to take precedence over land issues; and successful attempts to raise peregrines in captivity and later release them to the wild. While writing the book, Houle changed the names of various people and places, explaining the choice by saying [...] "I felt more comfortable changing the names because I worked for so long with those people, it was impossible to <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> them if I named them".|$|E
50|$|According to David Simon's {{commentary}} on the DVD of this episode, the blinds {{in the room where}} the ComStat meeting is held are open when someone is trying to bring some truth into the room—in this episode, Colvin <b>is</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> his district's increasing crime stats and the blinds are partially open.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2002, Cpl. Randy Walsh {{received}} {{search warrants}} to raid seven homes, although later analysis {{suggested that if}} he had <b>been</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> their evidence before the judge, the warrants would not have been granted. A publication ban initially prevented the media from reporting the identities of those targeted, although later reports confirmed which buildings had been searched.|$|R
50|$|On his 5th birthday, a {{boy named}} Billy makes a secret wish that only his {{grandmother}} knows after blowing out the candles. His grandmother is frail, but loves Billy {{more than anything in}} the world; he's given her new life and new happiness. Although she <b>is</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> her prospects at living much longer, Billy's parents try to convince him otherwise.|$|R
500|$|... "The Variable" [...] was the {{hundredth}} {{episode of the}} show to be produced and aired on television. Josh Holloway, who {{plays the role of}} Sawyer, said, [...] "Just statistically speaking, to hit a hundred episodes doesn't happen very often, especially on a show where everyone is saying 'Lost on an island? What are you gonna do after a season or two?', so the fact that we've lasted not only a season or two but flourishing still at this time... it's shocking... it's amazing to me." [...] In an interview with The News & Observer, Lindelof recalled meeting with the ABC executives in 2004 to pitch the idea of a plane crash and survivors stranded on an island full of mystery and danger. When Lindelof was asked by the executives where the Lost saga would stand in the future, he replied, [...] "We're probably not going to get past episode thirteen. Let's all <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> that up front." [...] Lindelof added that if he had [...] "traveled back in time to tell myself after that meeting {{that we were going to}} make it to a hundred and still have a season beyond that, I would have laughed in my face." [...] The hundredth episode milestone was celebrated by the cast and crew on location in Oahu, Hawaii. Duff Goldman and his crew from the Food Network's American television show Ace of Cakes made a special Lost cake for the party to commemorate the milestone. The cake featured replicas of a Dharma beer bottles, the computer from the Swan station, a suitcase and a miniature Oceanic Flight 815. The Ace of Cakes episode ("LOST in Hawaii") featuring the making of the cake aired on the Food Network in the United States on May 9, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Big Black's first {{release for}} Touch and Go was the Headache EP in spring 1987. The cover artwork for the limited {{original}} {{edition of the}} EP {{was a pair of}} forensic photos of an accident victim whose head had been split down the middle, and the record was packaged in a black plastic [...] "body bag" [...] to conceal the artwork from sensitive consumers. A sticker on the EP's cover read [...] "Not as good as Atomizer, so don't get your hopes up, cheese!" [...] According to Durango, [...] "We didn't want to sit there and screw people. If we felt it wasn't as good, then we should just <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] Indeed, Headache recycled many of the same sounds and themes found on Atomizer, showing signs that the band was lagging creatively. Durango later remarked that [...] "I was feeling tapped out ideawise. At that point I think we had tried everything that we wanted to try, musically and in the studio." ...|$|E
2500|$|Abbey {{has also}} drawn {{criticism}} for what some regard as his racist and sexist views. In an essay called [...] "Immigration and Liberal Taboos", collected in his 1988 book One Life at a Time, Please, Abbey expressed {{his opposition to}} immigration ("legal or illegal, from any source") into the United States: [...] "(I)t occurs to some of us that perhaps ever-continuing industrial and population growth is not the true road to human happiness, that simple gross quantitative increase of this kind creates only more pain, dislocation, confusion and misery. In which case it might be wise for us as American citizens to consider calling {{a halt to the}} mass influx of even more millions of hungry, ignorant, unskilled, and culturally-morally-genetically impoverished people. At least until we have brought our own affairs into order. Especially when these uninvited millions bring with them an alien mode of life which—let us <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> this—is not appealing to the majority of Americans. Why not? Because we prefer democratic government, for one thing; because we still hope for an open, spacious, uncrowded, and beautiful—yes, beautiful!—society, for another. The alternative, in the squalor, cruelty, and corruption of Latin America, is plain for all to see." ...|$|E
500|$|In August Yeats {{returned}} to Ireland, continuing his correspondence with Olivia, writing {{to her about}} Maud who had recently {{given birth to a}} daughter, Iseult. In her letters Olivia may have <b>been</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> her feelings toward him; in April 1895 he wrote to her, [...] "I no more complain of your writing of love, than I would complain of a portrait painter keeping to portraits".|$|R
6000|$|Captain Fipile laughed outright. [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>honest</b> enough <b>about</b> it, I must say. How {{about giving}} us a little information? Will you object to that?" ...|$|R
50|$|He married Phenie (Tryphena) Franklin (b. 1917 Middlesbrough, England) and {{had three}} {{children}} Jack, Richard and Dorothy. Having started {{his career as a}} national school teacher on Valentia, he attended an interview for a post as film critic for the Irish Press. He <b>was</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> his lack of knowledge, explaining that he had only heard of Greta Garbo and had been to a Mickey Mouse film, he was given the job anyway.|$|R
2500|$|Following an {{application}} on 19 December 2012 by the Attorney General Dominic Grieve, the High Court quashed the verdicts {{in the original}} inquests and ordered fresh inquests to be held. Sir John Goldring was appointed as Assistant Coroner for South Yorkshire (East) and West Yorkshire (West) to conduct those inquests. The inquest hearings started on Monday 31 March 2014 at Warrington. Transcripts of the proceedings and evidence that was produced during the hearings were published at the Hillsborough Inquests official website. On 6 April 2016, the nine jurors were sent out to consider their verdicts. These were formally given to the inquest at 11:00 on 26 April 2016. The jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing in respect of all 96 victims (by majority verdict of 7–2). Upon receiving the April 2016 verdict, Hillsborough Family Support Group chair Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son James {{was killed in the}} disaster, said: [...] "Let's <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> this – people were against us. We had the media against us, as well as the establishment. Everything was against us. The only people that weren't against us was our own city. That's why I am so grateful to my city and so proud of my city. They always believed in us.|$|E
2500|$|Publicist Marvet Britto stated, [...] "Jackson embodies grace, {{style and}} integrity...She {{has never been}} known as a bad person." [...] Britto {{describes}} Jackson’s videotaped apology as [...] "impersonal", saying, [...] "She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived." [...] Jackson said of the apology, [...] "I probably {{should have done it}} live. But there was so much going on at the time that I needed to just get it done. It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it." [...] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition. Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting [...] "I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great at what he does – he's a genius." [...] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. [...] "I really want to <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> this, but I just feel that anything I say about him will be taken the wrong way", said Jackson. [...] "I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. You know, some people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And it hurts me to say that." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, [...] "I don't know whether it will or not. But I have a feeling it probably will, because kind of whatever's happening in her life tends to be what she writes about [...] It'd be kind of interesting to see what her feeling is about it." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{his review}} for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A- score, calling it [...] "a no-fuss movie that casts a rich, {{tranquil}} spell." [...] Gleiberman concluded, [...] "It's the rare {{portrait of a}} happy marriage that <b>is</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> the complex currents of desire, and the drama is beautifully played by Bale, who gawks with soulful sweetness, and Watson, who does her most piercing work since Breaking the Waves." ...|$|R

In his column, titled Jeremy Kyle Says..., Kyle adopts a frank style in responding to readers' problems that at times closely resembles the approach he takes on The Jeremy Kyle Show. In 2009, Kyle wrote his first book, I'm Only <b>Being</b> <b>Honest,</b> <b>about</b> Britain's social problems and his views on how to solve them including recounts of his past and personal life.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Guardian Middle East editor Martin Chulov, Misha'an admitted that despite being {{a senior member of}} a parliamentary committee investigating official corruption, he was himself highly corrupt. “There is no solution,” he said. “Everybody is corrupt, from the top of society to the bottom. Everyone. Including me.”, “At least I <b>am</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> it,” he shrugged. “I was offered $5m by someone to stop investigating him. I took it, and continued prosecuting him anyway.” ...|$|R

He would not be sitting in the office day after day making plans for the business when the war is over." ...|$|E
6000|$|Being {{in so far}} I {{thought it}} could do no harm {{to go a little}} farther. I {{described}} (still in bantering mood) my first meeting with Zulime Taft more than five years before. I pictured her as she looked to me then, and as she afterward appeared when I met her a second time in the home of her sister in Chicago. [...] "I admit that I was greatly impressed by her," [...] I went on, [...] "but just when I had begun to hope for a better understanding, her brother Lorado chilled me with the information that she was about to be claimed by another man. To <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> it, mother, I am not sure that she is interested in me even now; although one of her friends has just written me to say that Lorado was mistaken, and that Zulime is not engaged to any one. I am going down to visit some friends at the camp to test the truth of this; but don't say a word about it, for my information may be wrong." ...|$|E
50|$|Engaging in {{internet}} relationships is also risky because the information placed online about an individual {{does not have}} to be accurate. An individual can formulate an entirely different persona and pose as this person as long as they desire. This can be hurtful to individuals who <b>are</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> their identities and believe that they are in a positive relationship or friendship with the individual. This concept has been most recently illustrated on the television show, Catfish: The TV Show.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{performers}} who use cold reading <b>are</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> {{their use of}} the technique. Lynne Kelly, Kari Coleman, Ian Rowland, and Derren Brown have used these techniques at either private fortune-telling sessions or open forum [...] "talking with the dead" [...] sessions in the manner of those who claim to be genuine mediums. Only after receiving acclaim and applause from their audience do they reveal that they needed no psychic power for the performance, only a sound knowledge of psychology and cold reading.|$|R
