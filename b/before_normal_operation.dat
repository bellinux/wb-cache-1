Otherwise, {{deadlock}} may occur due to wrong handshake communication between processes. This thesis first reviews the traditional Global Reset Schemes (GRS). It then proposes a new Wave Reset Schemes (WRS). By utilizing the third possible value of QDI data codes - reset value, WRS propagates the data with reset value and triggers Local Reset (LR) sequentially. The global reset network for GRS {{can be removed}} and all reset signals are generated locally for each process. Circuits templates {{as well as some}} special blocks are modified to accommodate the reset value in WRS. An algorithm is proposed to choose the proper Local Reset Input (LRI) in order to shorten reset time. WRS is then applied to an iterative multiplier.

40|$|This master’s thesis {{presents}} {{an approach to}} validation of the sensor con-figuration in control systems. Major faults in the commissioning phase of refrigeration systems are caused by defects related to sensors. With a num-ber of similar sensors that differ only by spatial location and their use in the control system, fault-finding is not trivial and it often results in expensive delays. Validation and handling of faults in the sensor configuration are therefore essential to cut costs during commissioning. With passive fault-diagnosis methods falling short on this problem, this thesis describes an ac-tive diagnosis procedure to isolate sensor faults at the commissioning stage, <b>before</b> <b>normal</b> <b>operation</b> has started. Using statistical methods, residuals are evaluated versus multiple hypothesis models in a minimization process to uniquely identify the sensor configuration. The method as such is generic and {{is shown in the}} sequel to work convincingly on refrigeration systems with both nonlinear behaviors and significant mutual differences. The thesis includes sections concerning the target system with respect t...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an {{efficient}} estimation and pilot-free online re-calibration scheme for frequency-selective I/Q imbalance in broadband direct-conversion transmitters (Txs) with multi-band multi-standard capability. For such Txs, the main {{challenge lies in}} the online re-calibration during normal operation, where an ordinary Tx signal, instead of dedicated pilot signals, is used for estimation. In particular, it can happen that the Tx signal consists of noncontiguous subbands and has large spectral gaps, which will cause a severe ill-conditioned matrix problem in existing state-of-the-art (SoA) schemes deploying least squares (LS) estimation. In the proposed scheme, this problem is avoided by exploiting {{the fact that the}} frequency-selective part of I/Q imbalance is approximately time invariant. Therefore, <b>before</b> <b>normal</b> <b>operation,</b> pilot-based initial estimation is carried out to achieve high-precision estimation of the frequency-selective part. Afterward, pilot-free on line re-calibration is applied to cope with the time-varying frequency-independent part. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that the proposed re-calibration scheme is well conditioned and clearly outperforms the existing SoA schemes deploying LSE. To emphasize practical deployments, we also conduct performance analysis considering time synchronization error (TSE) and provide a Toeplitz-extension-based solution to make the scheme robust against TSE. We further provide complexity analysis and show that the proposed scheme has much lower complexity than the SoA schemes. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme and the fundamental working assumptions are verified by both numerical simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments with real radio-frequency signal measurements, including real-time field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) implementation of the developed digital calibration circuits...|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} the dynamic {{preparation}} of reference gas mixtures based on the diffusion technique has been developed by the National Metrology Institute of Italy i. e. the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM). The gravimetric method used for the estimation of the diffusion rate and consequent concentration, gives the system the property to be a primary standard. The system can generate mixtures with low uncertainty and high stability in the 20 nmol. mol- 1 - 2. 5 µmol. mol- 1 concentration range with a 5 % (k = 2) expanded uncertainty for mixtures of acetone in air. Based on this system, a transportable device for the generation of VOC reference gas mixtures {{to be used as}} calibration standard was designed and developed. The methodology used for the scale down included several steps. An initial characterization and modelling of the primary device was done using computational tools. Based on the response of the computational model to the different physical quantities, a set of design parameters was identified. The thresholds for this set of parameters were established and translated into a set of design criteria to consider {{in order to keep the}} metrological performance target. After the design and development of the transportable device, a metrological characterization was carried out, to verify its capabilities. The metrological characterization of the generator was done in the Dutch National Metrology Institute i. e. the Van Swinden Laboratory (VSL) trough Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) analyses to evaluate the linearity, the reproducibility and the short term stability. The results for the generation of methanol mixtures with molar fractions in the 80 - 150 nmol. mol- 1 range, were 99. 6 % linear, with a reproducibility after 3 days within 2, 9 % and a short term stability better than 1 % per hour. Repeatable measurements of the generated concentration were obtained for three different molar fractions, with the use of both CRDS (VSL) and the GC/FID (INRIM). A flow of the desired dry pure carrier gas can be connected to the device. The presence of water in the system has not been taken into account and further analyses should be done before introducing it to the system. Water presence might affect the adsorption rate, and consequently the flushing time <b>before</b> <b>normal</b> <b>operation.</b> This transportable device is able to perform in-situ calibration of instruments and has been designed to generate gas mixtures of up to four species at a time...|$|E

40|$|The {{premise of}} the design of {{operations}} for the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) is that the vehicles will drive each day. As a result, they will encounter some aspect of the terrain environment that cannot be anticipated or otherwise accommodated by the sequences linked onboard that day. The operations team then must correct the problem by planning then commanding the execution of a different drive the next day. Often other aspects of the operation on the surface of Mars: environmental changes, component degradation, errors in sequence design or execution, etc., lead to anomalies which must be addressed <b>before</b> <b>normal</b> <b>operations</b> can resume. The operational design that makes it possible to recover from a driving error each day also reduces the time needed to recover from anomalies. As an example of the efficiency achieved, less than 5 % (about 30 sols out of 700 sols of operations) of the time on the surface has been devoted to recovery from anomalies for each vehicle. In this paper the major anomalies experienced by the MER rovers will be recounted and the streamlined approaches to addressing these problems described. The operational flexibility developed for these missions is also a function of the system design that anticipated a number of likely faults and conditions arising from uncertainty in sequence execution and environmental change. This design will be described as well as the considerations in operation that motivated this design. These considerations will likely be present in any future surface mission...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Aggressive CMOS scaling accelerates {{transistor}} and interconnect wearout, {{resulting in}} shorter and less predictable lifetimes for microprocessors. Studies show that wearout faults have a gradual onset, manifesting initially as timing faults before eventually leading to hard breakdown. Prior work suggests detecting wearout faults {{as they begin}} to affect <b>normal</b> <b>operation,</b> but these techniques require complex circuit and/or microarchitectural changes. Our proposal, FIRST (Fingerprints In Reliability and Self Test), uses existing design-for-test hardware (scanout chains) and infrequent periodic tests under reduced frequency guardbands to observe marginal behavior that {{is an indication of}} wearout. FIRST is a low-overhead, complexityeffective methodology for detecting emerging wearout faults <b>before</b> they affect <b>normal</b> <b>operation.</b> We discuss the operation of FIRST error detection, present a model for wearout fault simulation, and demonstrate FIRST’s effectiveness on a portion of a commercial microprocessor design.

40|$|Reliability of Active Front End (AFE) {{converter}} can {{be improved}} if converter faults can be identified before startup. Startup diagnostics of the LCL filter can be an useful tool to accomplish this. An algorithm based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the filter step response is shown {{to be able to}} detect variation of filter components. This is extended to consider conditions of short circuit and open circuit of filter components. This method can identify failed components in a LCL filter before operating the converter, which otherwise may lead to undesirable operation. Analytical expressions are derived for the frequency spectrum of the LCL filter during step excitation using continuous Fourier Transform and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). A finite state machine Finite State Machine (FSM) based algorithm is use to sequence the startup diagnostics <b>before</b> commencing <b>normal</b> <b>operation</b> of the power converter. It is shown that the additional computational resource required to perform the diagnostic algorithm is small when compared with the overall inverter control program. The diagnostic functions can be readily implemented in advanced digital controllers that are available today.
