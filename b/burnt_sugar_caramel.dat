40|$|The first aim of {{our study}} was to improve {{characterisation}} of the volatile fraction of aromatic caramel by applying heart-cutting multidimensional gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and olfactometry (MDGC-MS-O) on targeted odorant fractions. The second aim was to compare the volatile composition of two caramel samples, which differed {{in terms of their}} carbohydrate composition and cooking process. MDGC analyses enabled identification of 37 compounds (17 with the addition of pure standard) in the <b>burnt</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>caramel,</b> 20 of which were reported {{for the first time in}} caramel. Fifteen compounds were identified as odour-active and described using a range of attributes such as floral, roasted, spicy and almond. Furans, lactones and acids resulting from the thermal breakdown of sugars predominated in the volatile fraction of the <b>burnt</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>caramel,</b> due to the harsher cooking conditions. Finally, these results have enabled a clearer understanding of aromatic caramel as well as the identification of new compounds which might make an important contribution to its aroma...|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} finding of the {{presence}} of carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) in different carbohydrate based food caramels, viz. bread, jaggery, <b>sugar</b> <b>caramel,</b> corn flakes and biscuits, where the preparation involves heating of the starting material. The CNPs were amorphous in nature; the particles were spherical having sizes in the range of 4 – 30  nm, depending upon the source of extraction. The results also indicated that particles formed at higher temperature were smaller than those formed at lower temperature. Excitation tuneable photoluminescence was observed for all the samples with quantum yield (QY) 1. 2, 0. 55 and 0. 63 %, for CNPs from bread, jaggery and <b>sugar</b> <b>caramels</b> respectively. The present discovery suggests potential usefulness of CNPs for various biological applications, as the sources of extraction are regular food items, some of which have been consumed by humans for centuries, and thus they can be considered as safe...|$|R
