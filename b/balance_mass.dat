It is an ideal material {{to use as a}} dolly for riveting, where the mass necessary for good results can be achieved in a compact bar. High-density alloys of tungsten with nickel, copper or iron are used in high-quality darts (to allow for a smaller diameter and thus tighter groupings) or for fishing lures (tungsten beads allow the fly to sink rapidly). Some cello C strings are wound with tungsten. The extra density gives this string more projection and often cellists will buy just this string and use it with three strings from a different set. Tungsten is used as an absorber on the electron telescope on the Cosmic Ray System of the two Voyager spacecraft.|$|E

5000|$|Many [...] "tuning" [...] firms {{producing}} [...] "billet" [...] cranks misunderstand {{the design}} criteria of counterbalance weights. They produce cranks that although made from better materials lack sufficient counter weights and deflect more than OEM standard at high rpm. Other [...] "tuning" [...] firms offer [...] "lightening" [...] and [...] "knife edging" [...] of OEM cranks, this is largely {{at the expense}} of the counterbalance weights. To restore the couple and reduce crankshaft deflection back to OEM spec further work has to undertaken, either installing slugs of high density metal (tungsten) in the counterweights or core drilling the big end journals. For both billet and re-worked OEM cranks if the deflection is greater than OEM spec the results will be poor fatigue and bearing life. For worst cases this may require frequent engine tear downs to replace bearing shells when the crank rubs on the bearing and seasonal replacement of the crank. All of the rotating couple due to crank throw and rotating portion of con-rod and 1/2 the reciprocating couple should be countered. As the <b>balance</b> <b>mass</b> is dependent on the mass of the piston and con-rods if these are changed (for lighter after-market items) then the effect on the couple should be calculated and corrected. Any reputable maker of billet or re-worked cranks should be able to either specify the weights of con-rods and pistons or correct the crank counter weights to suit con-rods and pistons.|$|E

(The equilibrium line, which lies at approximately 1200 m elevation on the ice sheet, is {{the boundary between the}} area of net snow accumulation at higher elevations and the areas of net melting at lower elevations around the ice sheet.) Ice drainage divides and six major drainage systems are delineated using surface topography from ERS (European Remote Sensing) radar altimeter data.

The ratio of the ice mass above the equilibrium line to the rate of mass output implies an effective exchange time of approximately 6000 years for total mass exchange.

40|$|We {{present a}} Seasonal Sensitivity Characteristic (SSC) of Vatnajökull (Iceland), which {{consists}} of {{the sensitivity of the}} mean specific <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> to monthly perturbations in temperature and precipitation. The climate in Iceland is predominantly maritime (high precipitation) although often the polar air mass influences the area. This results in temperature sensitivities that are high in summer and nearly zero during the winter months. In contrast, precipitation sensitivities are high in winter and low in summer. We use the SSC of Vatnajökull as a reduced <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> model, with which we reconstruct the <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> of Vatnajökull since 1825.

40|$|When {{dynamically}} balanced {{mechanisms and}} robots {{are used for}} pick and place motion, the payload influences the dynamic balance. The payload can be a cause of serious vibrations which for instance can reduce {{the accuracy of the}} mechanism considerably. In such a case reconfiguration of the mechanism during pick and place motion can help correct the dynamic balance. Due to rapid motion and short cycle times however, the reconfiguration has to be done rapidly and can be a cause of serious vibrations in itself. To eliminate these vibrations, the reconfiguration should preferably be done in a dynamically balanced way. Since moment balancing can conveniently be done actively in any situation, this article focusses on force-balanced reconfiguration of mechanisms to force balance variable payload. Three fundamental approaches to force-balanced reconfiguration were obtained: (1) reconfiguration by relocating the <b>balancing</b> <b>mass,</b> (2) reconfiguration by relocating the center-of-rotation of the link with <b>balancing</b> <b>mass</b> and (3) reconfiguration by changing the value of the <b>balancing</b> <b>mass.</b> It is shown that under certain circumstances a mechanism with payload can be force balanced by force-balanced reconfiguration. In addition, all approaches can be applied to either obtain partial force-balance of the mechanism with payload in a perfectly force-balanced way, or to obtain perfect force balance of the mechanism with payload in a partially force-balanced way, i. e. for which the vibrations during reconfiguration are reduced...|$|R
