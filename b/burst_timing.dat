2500|$|An {{originally}} classified 1984 US interagency {{intelligence assessment}} states that {{in both the}} preceding 1970s and 80s, the Soviet and US military were already following the [...] "existing trends" [...] in warhead miniaturization, of higher accuracy and lower yield nuclear warheads, this is seen when assessing the most numerous physics packages in the US arsenal, which in the 1960s were the B28 and W31, however both quickly became less prominent with the 1970s mass production runs of the 50 Kt W68, the 100 Kt W76 and in the 1980s, with the B61. This trend towards miniaturization, enabled by advances in inertial guidance and accurate GPS navigation etc., was motivated by a multitude of factors, namely the desire to leverage the physics of equivalent megatonnage that miniaturization offered; of freeing up space to fit more MIRV warheads and decoys on each missile. Alongside the desire to still destroy hardened targets but while reducing the severity of fallout collateral damage depositing on neighboring, and potentially friendly, countries. As {{it relates to the}} likelihood of nuclear winter, the range of potential thermal radiation ignited fires was already reduced with miniaturization. For example, the most popular nuclear winter paper, the 1983 TTAPS paper, had described a 3000 Mt counterforce attack on ICBM sites with each individual warhead having approximately one Mt of energy; however not long after publication, Michael Altfeld of Michigan State University and political scientist Stephen Cimbala of Pennsylvania State University argued that the then already developed and deployed smaller, more accurate warheads (e.g. W76), together with lower detonation heights, could produce the same counterforce strike with a total of only 3 Mt of energy being expended. They continue that, [...] if the nuclear winter models prove to be representative of reality, then far less climatic-cooling would occur, even if firestorm prone areas existed in the target list, as lower fusing heights such as surface bursts, would also limit the range of the burning thermal rays due to terrain masking and shadows cast by buildings, while also temporarily lofting far more localized fallout when compared to airburst fuzing – the standard mode of employment against un-hardened targets. This logic is similarly reflected in the originally classified 1984 Interagency Intelligence assessment, which suggests that targeting planners would simply have to consider target combustibility along with yield, height of <b>burst,</b> <b>timing</b> and other factors {{to reduce the amount of}} smoke to safeguard against the potentiality of a nuclear winter. Therefore, as a consequence of attempting to limit the target fire hazard by reducing the range of thermal radiation with fuzing for surface and sub-surface bursts, this will result in a scenario where the far more concentrated, and therefore deadlier, local fallout that is generated following a surface burst forms, as opposed to the comparatively dilute global fallout created when nuclear weapons are fuzed in air burst mode.|$|E

The strong signal from SGR J 1745 – 29 presents a complex pulse profile modulated with pulsed fraction 27 % ± 3 % in the 3 - 10 keV band. Two observations spaced nine days apart yield a spin-down rate of [dot over P] = (6. 5 ± 1. 4) × 10 [superscipt – 12]. This implies a magnetic field B = 1. 6 × 10 [superscript 14] G, spin-down power [dot over E] = 5 × 10 [superscript 33] erg s[superscript – 1], and characteristic age P/ 2 [dot over P] = 9 × 10 [superscript 3] yr for the rotating dipole model. However, the current [dot over P] may be erratic, especially during outburst. The flux and modulation remained steady during the observations and the 3 - 79 keV spectrum is well fitted by a combined blackbody plus power-law model with temperature kT [subscript BB] = 0. 96 ± 0. 02 keV and photon index Γ = 1. 5 ± 0. 4.

40|$|Diaz Trigo et al. (2013) {{reported}} {{the detection of}} three Doppler-shifted emission lines arising from baryonic matter in the jet of 4 U 1630 - 47 during its 2012 outburst. Here we propose an alternative model that, without the need of the lines from the jet, and with less free parameters, fits the same data equally well. In our model we allow the abundances of S and Fe in the interstellar medium to vary; the best-fitting values are, respectively, 1. 5 and 0. 5 times solar, consistent with recent findings. Our model also includes a moderately broad emission line and a narrow absorption line due to highly ionised Fe. (These lines are also present in the other observations of this source during the 2012 outburst.) This model fits well all the XMM-Newton observations of this source, both in <b>burst</b> and <b>timing</b> mode. In addition to the components that we fitted to the burst-mode data, the timing-mode observations show several absorption features due to ionised Fe and Ni, which reveal {{the presence of a}} highly-ionised absorber close to the source. Our model also fits well the burst-mode data using the most recent calibration files (March 2015), whereas the model from Diaz Trigo et al. does not...|$|R
40|$|The fetal {{respiratory}} response to acute hypoxia {{is characterized by}} depression, often to apnea. This study examined the effect of hypoxia on the electromyogram (EMG) of the thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle. Under anesthesia catheters {{were placed in the}} fetal sheep carotid artery, fourth cerebral ventricle, trachea and amniotic fluid and wires sewn into the diaphragm and TA muscle. During normoxic episodes of slow fetal breathing (< 40 breaths per min) TA EMG activity was phasic beginning immediately after diaphragmatic EMG bursts and ending well before the next <b>burst.</b> This <b>timing</b> is consistent with the post-inspiratory (post-I) phase of the respiratory cycle. Lowering fetal arterial Pa O 2 from ~ 20 mm Hg to ~ 13 mmHg resulted in arrest of diaphragm EMG and tonic TA activity. Instillation of the (R,S) [...] amino- 3 - hydroxy- 5 -methylisoxazole- 4 -proprionic acid (AMPA) ionotrophic glutamate receptor antagonist 2, 3 -dihydro- 6 -nitro- 7 -sulphamoyl-benzo(f) quinoxaline (NBQX) into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the fourth ventricle abolished tracheal pressure deflections and diaphragmatic EMG activity. Tonic TA activity, however, could still be evoked by hypoxia. These results indicate that fetal post-I motoneurons are not inhibited by moderate hypoxia and that their tonic activity may be due to a loss of inhibitory input...|$|R
40|$|Automated Science Processing (ASP) will be {{performed}} by the GLAST Large Area Telescope (LAT) Instrument Science Operations Center (ISOC) on data from the satellite {{as soon as the}} Level 1 data are available in the ground processing pipeline. ASP will consist of time-critical science analyses that will facilitate follow-up and multi-wavelength observations of transient sources. These analyses include refinement of gamma-ray <b>burst</b> (GRB) positions, <b>timing,</b> flux and spectral properties, off-line searches for untriggered GRBs and gamma-ray afterglows, longer time scale monitoring of a standard set of sources (AGNs, X-ray binaries), and searches for previously unknown flaring sources in the LAT band. We describe the design of ASP and its scientific products; and we show results of a prototype implementation, driven by the standard LAT data processing pipeline, as applied to simulated LAT and GBM data...|$|R
