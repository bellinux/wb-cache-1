In April of the same year she became Professor of Pediatrics after a three days examination at the University of Rome. In 1966 the entrepreneur Dr. Vittorio Rollero and his wife Gianna, because of their 6 years old daughter admitted for leukemia, understood the financial difficulties of the Department, mostly for the heavy costs of drugs. They created the “Children’s Cancer and Leukemia Fund” to help and increase the tight budget. In 1972 a big amount of money allowed the birth of a new division named “Medicine 4th”.|$|E
40|$|Background: Pancytopenia is a {{relatively}} common hematological entity. It is a striking feature of many serious and life-threatening illnesses, ranging from simple drug-induced <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> hypoplasia, megaloblastic anemia to fatal <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>aplasias</b> and leukemias. The severity of pancytopenia and the underlying pathology determine the management and prognosis. Thus, identification of the correct cause will help in implementing appropriate therapy. Objectives: To study the clinical presentations in pancytopenia due to various causes; and to evaluate hematological parameters, including <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> aspiration. Materials and Methods: It was a prospective study, and 104 pancytopenic patients were evaluated clinically, along with hematological parameters and <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> aspiration in Hematology Unit, Department of Pathology, JJMMC, Davanagere, {{during the period of}} September 2005 to September 2007. Results: Among 104 cases studied, age of patients ranged from 2 to 80 years {{with a mean age of}} 41 years, and male predominance. Most of the patients presented with generalized weakness and fever. The commonest physical finding was pallor, followed by splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. Dimorphic anemia was the predominant blood picture. <b>Bone</b> <b>marrow</b> aspiration was conclusive in all cases. The commonest marrow finding was hypercellularity with megaloblastic erythropoiesis. The commonest cause for pancytopenia was megaloblastic anemia (74. 04 %), followed by aplastic anemia (18. 26 %). Conclusion: The present study concludes that detailed primary hematological investigations along with <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> aspiration in cytopenic patients are helpful for understanding disease process and to diagnose or to rule out the causes of cytopenia. These are also helpful in planning further investigations and management...|$|R
40|$|Separase is a {{protease}} whose {{liberation from}} its inhibitory chaperone Securin triggers sister chromatid disjunction at anaphase onset in yeast by cleaving cohesin's kleisin subunit. We have created conditional knockout alleles {{of the mouse}} Separase and Securin genes. Deletion of both copies of Separase but not Securin causes embryonic lethality. Loss of Securin reduces Separase activity because deletion of just one copy of the Separase gene is lethal to embryos lacking Securin. In embryonic fibroblasts, Separase depletion blocks sister chromatid separation but does not prevent other aspects of mitosis, cytokinesis, or chromosome replication. Thus, fibroblasts lacking Separase become highly polyploid. Hepatocytes stimulated to proliferate in vivo by hepatectomy also become unusually large and polyploid {{in the absence of}} Separase but are able to regenerate functional livers. Separase depletion in <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> causes <b>aplasia</b> and the presumed death of hematopoietic cells other than erythrocytes. Destruction of sister chromatid cohesion by Separase may be a universal feature of mitosis in eukaryotic cells...|$|R

40|$|Aplastic anaemia (AA) is {{characterized}} by hypocellular marrow, pancytopenia, and risk of severe anaemia, haemorrhage and infection. AA is often idiopathic, but frequently occurs after exposure to drugs/chemicals. However, the pathogenesis of AA is not clearly understood, {{and there are no}} convenient animal models of drug-induced AA. We have evaluated regimens of busulphan (BU) administration in the mouse to produce a model of chronic <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>aplasia</b> showing features of human AA. Mice were given 8 doses of BU at 0, 5. 25 and 10. 50 mg/kg over 23 days; marrow and blood samples were examined at 1, 19, 49, 91 and 112 days after dosing. At day 1 post dosing, in mice treated at 10. 50 mg/kg, nucleated marrow cells, CFU-GM and Erythroid-CFU were reduced. Similarly, peripheral blood erythrocytes, leucocytes, platelets and reticulocytes were reduced. At day 19 and 49 post dosing, there was a trend for parameters to return towards normal. However, at day 91 and 112 post dosing, values remained significantly depressed, with a stabilized chronic <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>aplasia.</b> At day 91 and 112 post dosing, marrow cell counts, CFU-GM and Erythroid-CFU were decreased; marrow nucleated cell apoptosis and c-kit+ cell apoptosis were increased; peripheral blood erythrocyte, leucocyte, and platelet counts were reduced.

40|$|International audienceAutologous {{stem cell}} therapy (ACT) has been {{proposed}} to prevent irradiated victims from <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> (BM) <b>aplasia</b> by grafting hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) collected early after damage, provided that a functional graft of sufficient size could be produced ex vivo. To address this issue, {{we set up a}} baboon model of cell therapy in which autologous peripheral blood HSPCs collected before lethal total body irradiation were irradiated in vitro (2. 5 Gy, D 0 1 Gy) to mimic the cell damage, cultured in small numbers for a week in a serum-free medium in the presence of antiapoptotic cytokines and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and then cografted. Our study shows that baboons cografted with expanded cells issued from 0. 75 and 1 x 10 (6) /kg irradiated CD 34 + cells and MSCs (n= 2) exhibited a stable long-term multilineage engraftment. Hematopoietic recovery became uncertain when reducing the CD 34 + cell input (0. 4 x 10 (6) /kg CD 34 + cells; n= 3). However, platelet recovery was accelerated in all surviving cografted animals, when compared with baboons transplanted with unirradiated, unmanipulated CD 34 + cells (0. 5 - 1 x 10 (6) /kg, n= 4).

40|$|Radiation-induced (RI) tissue {{injuries}} can {{be caused}} by radiation therapy, nuclear accidents or radiological terrorism. Notwithstanding the complexity of RI pathophysiology, there are some effective approaches to treatment of both acute and chronic radiation damages. Cytokine therapy is the main strategy capable of preventing or reducing the acute radiation syndrome (ARS), and hematopoietic growth factors (GF) are particularly effective in mitigating <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> (BM) <b>aplasia</b> and stimulating hematopoietic recovery. However, first, as a consequence of RI stem and progenitor cell death, use of cytokines should be restricted to a range of intermediate radiation doses (3 to 7 Gy total body irradiation). Second, ARS is a global illness that requires treatment of damages to other tissues (epithelial, endothelial, glial, etc.), which could be achieved using pleiotropic or tissue-specific cytokines. Stem cell therapy (SCT) is a promising approach developed in the laboratory that could expand the ability to treat severe radiation injuries. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (BM, mobilized peripheral blood and cord blood) transplantation has been used in radiation casualties with variable success due to limiting toxicity related to the degree of graft histocompatibility and combined injuries. Ex vivo expansion should be used to augment cord blood graft size and/or promote very immature stem cells. Autologous SCT might also be applied to radiation casualties from residual hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). Stem cell plasticity of different tissues such as liver or skeletal muscle, may also be used as a source of hematopoietic stem cells. Finally, other types of stem cells such as mesenchymal, endothelial stem cells or other tissue committed stem cells (TCSC), could be used for treating damages to nonhematopoietic organs...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{the present}} study was to prospectively explore the {{detailed}} longitudinal development of platelet increments in patients with chemotherapy-induced <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>aplasia</b> during the first 24 hours after platelet transfusion. METHODS: Patients admitted to the Haematology department during 7 months and fulfilled inclusion criteria were divided into 4 groups: Group 1, patients with acute leukaemia; Group 2, patients after autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT); Group 3, patients after allogeneic SCT; Group 4, patients given platelet transfusion prior to intervention.
