5|$|Fruit {{bodies are}} {{commonly}} parasitized by the ascomycete Hypomyces lactifluorum, transforming {{them into an}} edible known as a lobster mushroom. In this form, {{the surface of the}} fruit body develops into a hard, thin crust dotted with minute pimples, and the gills are reduced to blunt ridges. The flesh of the mushroom—normally brittle and crumbly—becomes compacted and less <b>breakable.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 11May the briefcase, {{complete}} with the documents, was returned to Haselden by the Spanish authorities; he forwarded it to London in the diplomatic bag. On receipt the documents were forensically examined, and the missing eyelash noted. Further tests showed that the fibres in the paper had been damaged by folding more than once, which confirmed that the letters had been extracted and read. An additional test was made as the papers – still wet {{by the time they}} returned to London – were dried out: the folded paper dried into the rolled form it had when the Spaniards had extracted it from the envelope. To allay any potential German fears that their activities had been discovered, another pre-arranged encrypted but <b>breakable</b> cable was sent to Haselden stating that the envelopes had been examined and that they had not been opened; Haselden leaked the news to Spaniards known to be sympathetic to the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Xenosaga I & II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} which retells {{the events of}} Xenosaga Episode I and its direct sequel Episode II. Cutscenes and the in-game environments and character sprites are displayed on the Nintendo DS (DS) console's top screen, with events outside still animated cutscenes taking place from an angled top-down perspective using two-dimensional graphics. Additional information is displayed on the DS's bottom screen. Environments can be freely explored, with <b>breakable</b> chests holding consumable items and accessories. Shops within the levels {{can be used to}} purchase items and equipment using in-game currency. Special EVA structures within the environment can be used to recover health points (HP) and a type of skill point called ether points (EP). Characters are able to both roam around open environments and enter story-based dungeons. During the course of the story, the player receives emails through the U.M.N. service, which is also used to store the game's glossary, a store of information on the world and characters.|$|E
25|$|The snare {{drum and}} cymbals are {{the core of}} the <b>breakables,</b> as they are {{particularly}} critical and individual components of the standard kit, in several related ways.|$|R
25|$|Much {{the same}} {{considerations}} apply to bass drum pedals and the stool, {{but these are}} not always considered <b>breakables,</b> particularly if changeover time between bands is very limited. Swapping the snare drum in a standard kit can be done very quickly. Replacing cymbals on stands takes longer, particularly if there are many of them, and cymbals are easily damaged by incorrect mounting, so many drummers prefer to bring their own cymbal stands.|$|R
50|$|Players have 5 tech levels. They {{start with}} the first one, which is the simplest, but can, however, acquire stars or crosses (stars for allies, crosses for axis), which are found in {{destroyed}} enemies or <b>breakables</b> (items in the surrounding environment that players can destroy). 10 stars upgrade players to the second level, 11 stars to the next, and 10 more {{to get to the}} final level, which makes destruction of most enemies easy.|$|R
25|$|Bisphosphonates {{are used}} to treat osteoporosis, osteitis deformans (Paget's disease of the bone), bone {{metastasis}} (with or without hypercalcaemia), multiple myeloma, and other conditions involving fragile, <b>breakable</b> bone.|$|E
25|$|Carl Walter and W.P. Murphy Jr. {{introduced}} {{the plastic bag}} for blood collection in 1950. Replacing <b>breakable</b> glass bottles with durable plastic bags made from PVC allowed {{for the evolution of}} a collection system capable of safe and easy preparation of multiple blood components from a single unit of whole blood.|$|E
25|$|A Molotov {{cocktail}} is a <b>breakable</b> {{glass bottle}} containing a flammable substance such as gasoline, alcohol or a napalm-like mixture, with some motor oil added, and usually {{a source of}} ignition such as a burning cloth wick {{held in place by}} the bottle's stopper. The wick is usually soaked in alcohol or kerosene, rather than petrol.|$|E
6000|$|We came {{past the}} window whose {{contents}} I was presently to know by heart, a very ordinary chemist's window except {{that there was}} a frictional electrical machine, an air pump and two or three tripods and retorts replacing the customary blue, yellow, and red bottles above. There was a plaster of Paris horse to indicate veterinary medicines among these <b>breakables,</b> and below were scent packets and diffusers and sponges and soda-water syphons and such-like things. Only in the middle there was a rubricated card, very neatly painted by hand, with these words-- ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{child was}} born with good intentions. [...] "Padda be good, be good," [...] {{he used to say}} as the <b>breakables</b> flew before him. [...] "Padda" [...] was his {{rendering}} of Pantagruel, the nickname Redwood imposed on him. And Cossar, disregarding certain Ancient Lights that presently led to trouble, did, after a conflict with the local building regulations, get building on a vacant piece of ground adjacent to Redwood's home, a comfortable well-lit playroom, schoolroom, and nursery for their four boys--sixty feet square about this room was, and forty feet high.|$|R
50|$|Preventive or {{mitigation}} measures take different forms for {{different types of}} disasters. In earthquake prone areas, these preventive measures might include structural changes such as the installation of an earthquake valve to instantly shut off the natural gas supply, seismic retrofits of property, and the securing of items inside a building. The latter may include the mounting of furniture, refrigerators, water heaters and <b>breakables</b> to the walls, {{and the addition of}} cabinet latches. In flood prone areas, houses can be built on poles/stilts. In areas prone to prolonged electricity black-outs installation of a generator ensures continuation of electrical service. The construction of storm cellars and fallout shelters are further examples of personal mitigative actions.|$|R
25|$|The {{position}} of {{the table in the}} room also impacts surgical workflow. A diagonal position in the OR may be considered in order to gain space and flexibility in the room, as well as access to the patient from all sides. Alternatively, a conventional surgery table can be combined with an imaging system if the vendor offers a corresponding integration. The operating room can then be used either with a radiotranslucent but not <b>breakable</b> tabletop that supports 3D imaging, or with a universal <b>breakable</b> tabletop that provides enhanced patient positioning, but restricts 3D imaging. The latter are particularly suited for neuro- or orthopedic surgery, and these integrated solutions recently also became commercially available. If it is planned to share the room for hybrid and open conventional procedures, these are sometimes preferred. They provide greater workflow flexibility because the tabletops are dockable and can be easily exchanged, but require some compromises with interventional imaging.|$|E
25|$|Only one new unit, the Neotank, {{was added}} to the {{original}} set in Advance Wars. Two new terrain features were introduced: the Missile Silo and the Pipeline (along with its <b>breakable</b> Pipe Seams). The Missile Silo can be fired by foot troops to deal area of effect damage, and pipelines act as impassable walls. Because of its function as a wall, players can use it to create maps smaller than the default dimension the map editor provides, something that was not possible in the game's predecessor.|$|E
25|$|Expeditions ventured {{south into}} the Sahara. Cornelius Balbus, Roman {{governor}} then at Utica, occupied in 19 BC. Gerama, desert {{capital of the}} Garamantes in the Fezzan (now west-central Libya). These Berber Garamantes had long-term, though unpredictable, <b>breakable,</b> contacts with the Mediterranean. Although Roman trade and other contact with the Berber Fezzan continued, on and off, raid or trade, extensive commercial traffic across the Sahara, directly to the more productive and populous lands south of the harsh deserts, had not yet developed; nor would it for many centuries.|$|E
50|$|Chet marries Mary {{and goes}} {{to work in the}} store, telling Monte that their old way of life is simply disappearing. Caught up {{in the spirit of the}} moment, Monte asks Martine to marry him, and she accepts. Monte goes on a {{drinking}} binge and rides a wild horse through town, causing considerable damage, smashing through a plate glass window and shattering an entire store of <b>breakables.</b> A rodeo owner, Colonel Wilson (Eric Christmas), sees him and offers him a job. Monte considers the high salary, but decides the work is too degrading and refuses. Eventually, they all must say goodbye to the lives they knew, and try to make a new start. When Shorty shoots and kills Chet while trying to rob the store, Monte, distraught after the death of his beloved Martine, goes after him.|$|R
6000|$|... [EN#21] They were, perhaps, {{a trifle}} {{too long for}} small beasts: seventy-seven centimètres (better seventy); and too deep, sixty, instead of fifty-eight. The width (forty-six) was all right. The best were painted, and defended from wet by an upper plate of zinc; the angles and the bottoms were {{strengthened}} with iron bands in pairs; and they were closed with hasps. At each end was a small block, carrying a strong looped rope for slinging the load to the pack-saddle; of these, duplicates should be provided. In order to defend our delicate apparatus from excessive shaking, we divided the inside, by battens, into several compartments. The smaller cases of bottles and <b>breakables</b> should have been cut {{to fit into the}} larger, but this had been neglected at Cairo. Finally, not a single box gave way on the march: that was reserved for the Suez-Cairo Railway, and for landing at the London Docks.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are several}} reasons for this division. When more than one band plays in a single performance, the drum kit is often {{considered}} part of the backline (the key rhythm section equipment that stays on stage all night, which often also includes a bass amp and a stage piano), and which is shared between/among the drummers. Often the main [...] "drawcard" [...] act will provide the drums, as they are being paid more, possibly have the better gear, and in any case have the prerogative of using their own. However sticks, snare drum and cymbals are commonly swapped, each drummer bringing their own, and sometimes other components. The term <b>breakables</b> in this context refers to whatever basic components the [...] "guest" [...] drummer is expected to bring. Similar considerations apply if using a [...] "house kit" [...] (a drum kit owned by the venue, which is rare), even if there is only one band at the performance.|$|R
25|$|The Molotov {{cocktail}} is {{a generic}} name {{used for a}} variety of improvised incendiary weapons. Due to the relative ease of production, they are frequently used by amateur protesters and non-professionally equipped fighters in urban guerrilla warfares. They are primarily intended to set targets ablaze rather than instantly destroy them. A Molotov cocktail is a <b>breakable</b> glass bottle containing a flammable substance such as gasoline/petrol or a napalm-like mixture, with some motor oil added, and usually a source of ignition such as a burning cloth wick held in place by the bottle's stopper. The wick is usually soaked in alcohol or kerosene, rather than gasoline.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{cardinal}} rules in object handling {{is to treat}} every object {{as if it is}} fragile and easily <b>breakable.</b> Museum technicians, curators, and conservators are trained to prepare a moving plan before an object is even touched that way minimal damage can occur when handling or moving an object. In the museum field is it a known fact that a vessel, or any object, should be held and handled by its strongest part, such as the base, and with both hands. Areas such as the handle or neck of a vessel tend to be the weakest points and may break if picked up by these components.|$|E
25|$|Interventionalists {{require a}} {{floating}} tabletop to allow fast and precise movements during angiography. Cardiac and vascular surgeons, in general, have less complex positioning needs, {{but based on}} their interventional experience in angiography {{may be used to}} having fully motorized movements of the table and the tabletop. For positioning patients on non <b>breakable</b> tabletops, positioning aids are available, i.e. inflatable cushions. Truly floating tabletops are not available with conventional OR tables. As a compromise, floatable angiography tables specifically made for surgery with vertical and lateral tilt are recommended. To further accommodate typical surgical needs, side rails for mounting surgical equipment like retractors or limb holders should be available for the table.|$|E
60|$|Benham's {{things were}} all {{packed up and}} the room had an air of having been {{straightened}} up neatly and methodically after a destructive cataclysm. One or two items that the chambermaid might possibly have overlooked in {{the normal course of}} things were carefully exhibited. For example, the sheet had been torn into half a dozen strips and they were lying {{side by side on the}} bed. The clock on the mantelpiece had been knocked into the fireplace and then pounded to pieces. All the looking-glasses in the room were smashed, apparently the electric lamp that stood on the night table by the bedside had been wrenched off and flung or hammered about amidst the other <b>breakables.</b> And there was a considerable amount of blood splashed about the room. The head chambermaid felt unequal to the perplexities of the spectacle and summoned her most convenient friend, the head chambermaid on the third floor, to her aid. The first-floor waiter joined their deliberations and several housemaids displayed a respectful interest in the matter. Finally they invoked the manager. He was still contemplating the scene of the disorder when the precipitate retreat of his subordinates warned him of Benham's return.|$|R
60|$|On January 28th, after a ruddy and cloudy sunset, El-Ayli, the 'Akabah wind, {{beginning}} at eleven p.m., {{gave us a}} taste of his quality. These northers are the Tyrants of the Gulf; which, comparatively unbroken by capes and headlands, allows them all their own way, carrying a strong swell, and at times huge waves, to meet the tide inflowing from the Red Sea. The storm began with a rush and a roar, as if it came from above. The gravel, striking the canvas, sounded like hail or heavy rain-drops; it then kicked down at one blow the two large tents: they had been carefully pitched above the reach of water, when wind only was to be guarded against. Fortunately most of our goods were packed, in expectation of embarking on the morrow; but the fall broke all the <b>breakables</b> that were not under cover, and carried newspapers and pamphlets, including--again, alas!--the Reseau Pentagonal of Elie de Beaumont, over the plain southwards till arrested by the heights of Jebel el-Fahísát. This Bora, {{as it would be}} called on the Adriatic, makes the air exceptionally cold and raw before dawn: it appears to abate between noon and sunset, and it is most violent at night: it either sensibly increases or lessens in turbulence with moonrise; and it usually lasts from three to seven days. We rigged up one of the native huts with the awning of a tent, till it looked very like a Gypsy dwelling, and in patience we possessed our souls, grumbling horridly like Britons.|$|R
25|$|Frequency {{analysis}} {{requires only}} {{a basic understanding}} of the statistics of the plaintext language and some problem solving skills, and, if performed by hand, tolerance for extensive letter bookkeeping. During World War II (WWII), both the British and the Americans recruited codebreakers by placing crossword puzzles in major newspapers and running contests for who could solve them the fastest. Several of the ciphers used by the Axis powers were <b>breakable</b> using frequency analysis, for example, some of the consular ciphers used by the Japanese. Mechanical methods of letter counting and statistical analysis (generally IBM card type machinery) were first used in World War II, possibly by the US Army's SIS. Today, the hard work of letter counting and analysis has been replaced by computer software, which can carry out such analysis in seconds. With modern computing power, classical ciphers are unlikely to provide any real protection for confidential data.|$|E
500|$|The Coast Ranges {{pass through}} {{the western part of}} the Trinity River Basin and consist of even younger rock {{formation}}s, chiefly the Franciscan Assemblage. The Franciscan formation consists of more unstable sedimentary and igneous rocks and soils that are highly <b>breakable</b> and prone to erosion. They formed even more recently in geologic history than the Klamath Mountains, primarily due to uplift along the Cascadia subduction zone. The Natural Resources Conservation Service refers to the Franciscan assemblage as a [...] "nightmare of rocks" [...] due to its complex and fragmented layers.|$|E
500|$|Combat in Silent Hill 4 {{follows the}} pattern {{set by the}} other games with a few key differences. The player has access {{to a variety of}} melee weapons but only two firearms. Certain melee weapons are <b>breakable.</b> Items which can be {{equipped}} such as talismans (which protect the player from damage from the hauntings in Henry's room) will eventually break after a short period of use. Another key difference in the combat system is that melee attacks may be [...] "charged" [...] before they are used, inflicting a greater amount of damage to an opponent than a quick attack.|$|E
500|$|Various {{throwing}} {{machines were}} in use throughout the classical and medieval periods. [...] Generally {{referred to as}} [...] "artillery", these engines could hurl, fire or shoot missiles and most could be used or adapted for throwing thermal weapons, by attacking and defending forces. [...] Barrels, fire pots and other <b>breakable</b> containers of pitch, Greek fire, and other incendiary mixtures could be thrown; other machines fired arrows and bolts, which could be ignited, or adapted to carry flammable mixtures. From the 12th century, Muslims in Syria were using clay and glass grenades for fire weapons, thrown by machines.|$|E
500|$|TNNS, {{pronounced}} [...] "tennis", is a brick-breaking action {{game where}} players use a paddle along the screen's left side to bounce a ball towards <b>breakable</b> objects {{on the right}} side of the screen, and to avoid getting the ball in their goal. It was released with little advanced notice in November 2012 for iOS as a universal app playable on iPhones, iPads, and iPods. Danny Cowan of IndieGames.com compared it with Sidhe Interactive's Shatter and VG247 called it a rendition of Breakout. Pocket Gamer likened it to both and further compared it with Alleyway, Arkanoid, and Super Hexagon with a [...] "telekinetic power" [...] to alter the ball's direction apart from the panel (as in Shatter).|$|E
500|$|The game {{takes place}} over six zones, each {{divided into two}} acts. Levels are {{populated}} with Robotnik's robots, called [...] "badniks"; Sonic and Tails can defeat badniks by jumping on them or using the [...] "spin dash" [...] attack, which also gives the character a speed boost. The levels include obstacles and other features such as vertical loops, corkscrews, <b>breakable</b> walls, spikes, water that the player can drown in, and bottomless pits. There is a miniboss fight with one of Robotnik's large, powerful robots {{at the end of}} the first act of each level and a full boss fight with Robotnik {{at the end of the}} second. Reaching a new level saves the game to one of six save slots.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{its release}} on the Virtual Console, Ninja Gaiden {{was met with}} high praise, {{especially}} for its elaborate story, amount of narrative, and usage of anime-like cinematic sequences. Some critics have bemoaned its gameplay for being too similar to Castlevania; similarities include identical displays {{on the top of}} the screen, items contained in <b>breakable</b> lanterns, and a nearly identical [...] "secondary weapons" [...] feature. A 1UP.com review noted that the two games have different dynamics and that several actions possible in Ninja Gaiden would be impossible in Castlevania. Contemporary reviews have considered the game [...] "groundbreaking" [...] for its pioneering use of stylized cutscenes, high quality music, and dark atmosphere. One review said that the game makes up for its high difficulty level with good gameplay. IGN said that it is one of the best platforming video games of all time.|$|E
500|$|For combat, in {{addition}} to using his fists (the first Silent Hill game where unarmed combat is possible), Travis accumulates a range of weapons throughout the town: firearms, melee weapons, and one-shot items usable in close combat; the latter two are <b>breakable.</b> Although one-shot items {{can be used to}} quickly kill some of the monsters encountered early on, Travis is vulnerable while performing this action to damage from quick enemies or those with long-ranged attacks. Origins also introduces the [...] "grapple" [...] system, a quick time event activated when a monster grabs him. [...] Should he escape, no damage is done to either him or the monster. The status of his [...] "health" [...] is indicated in the inventory, since the game does not feature a heads-up display; however, when his health is critical, the edges of the screen throb red, and his heartbeat is heard.|$|E
500|$|TNNS, {{pronounced}} [...] "tennis", is a brick-breaking action game {{released in}} November 2012 for iOS. As a universal app, it is playable on iPhones, iPads, and iPods. It {{was developed by}} Action Button Entertainment and produced by Rabbx. Players use a paddle along the screen's left side to bounce a ball towards <b>breakable</b> objects {{on the right side}} of the screen, and to avoid getting the ball in their goal. A star box ends the level. The game's over 500 stages are built as puzzles and played at random. Level features include wormholes that move the ball from one part of the screen to another and arrows that change the ball's trajectory. Power-ups include [...] "multi-ball", which puts multiple balls into play. TNNS also includes objectives, a same-device two-player mode, objectives, in-app purchases, and Facebook and Twitter integration. Action Button later released an Android version.|$|E
500|$|Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead {{recommended}} the game, giving high praise to the {{detail of the}} open world and the characterization of Batman, but again criticizing the Batmobile's battle mode feature {{as one of the}} weaker aspects of the game. GamesTM gave Arkham Knight a 9 out of 10, praising the game for functioning without the presence of the Joker, and praising the story for its intimacy and inviting, epic-scale nature. The Batmobile gameplay was described as [...] "thrilling", though the [...] "least immersive" [...] part of the game. The [...] "Dual Play" [...] elements were also hailed as the best aspect of the game in addition to their involvement with the Riddler challenges. Chris Carter of Destructoid, conversely was heavily critical of the Riddler challenges and their requirement for the game's full ending, finding many to be [...] "tedious" [...] while others lacked any resemblance of actual riddles, such as the <b>breakable</b> objects. He felt that the puzzles driven by intuition were the better elements of the mission.|$|E
500|$|Food was eaten from wooden or pewter trenchers with two-tined forks, large spoons, {{and hunting}} knives. Dishware was not popular {{since it was}} easily <b>breakable</b> and tended to dull knives quickly. Unlike the Quakers and Puritans, feasting with an {{abundance}} of food and drink was never discouraged and practiced as often as was feasible. Generally, backcountry cuisine did not share the religious austerity of the North nor the refinement of the South and was therefore denigrated by outsiders. An apparent lack of fastidiousness in preparing the food provoked further criticism from many sources. The Anglican Woodmason characterized backcountry cooking as [...] "exceedingly filthy and most execrable". Others told of matrons washing their feet in the cook pot, that it was considered unlucky to wash a milk churn and that human hairs in butter were considered a sign of quality. [...] These descriptions seem to be confirmed by an old saying attributed to Appalachian housewives: [...] "The mair [...] dirt the less hurt". Another expression of backcountry hardiness was the lack of appreciation of coffee and tea. Both were described as mere [...] "slops" [...] and were deemed appropriate only for those who were sick or unfit for labor.|$|E
500|$|Gameplay drew {{a variety}} of {{reactions}} from [...] "immersive" [...] and [...] "intriguing", to formulaic. The puzzles were generally considered by critics as challenging and well-done. The duration of the game was considered short, and reviewers criticized the spacing of the save points and absence of checkpoints. The game's adherence to the formula of the Silent Hill series also drew criticism; the opening comment of GameSpot's review remarked that [...] "this old fog needs to learn some new tricks", and further detailed that the game provided [...] "an entirely conventional adventure that relies on eight-year-old franchise hallmarks {{at the expense of}} anything truly new." [...] Some camera issues were noted, especially in tight corridors. Reviewers wrote that Origins had a greater emphasis on combat than previous installments, although reaction to the combat was generally negative. Some reviewers felt that the player was encouraged to avoid combat, due to {{a variety of}} gameplay factors, including the <b>breakable</b> melee weapons. On the other hand, GameSpy's David Chapman stated that the readily available weapons made Travis too powerful. The inclusion of quick time events was not well received by reviewers, who felt that it added nothing appealing to the game. Additionally, the soundtrack was frequently praised as frightening, and a part of the game's appeal. The PlayStation Official Magazine UK wrote: [...] "Despite its small-screen setting, Origins even manages a few genuine scares, mostly thanks to the first-rate sound: this should only be played through headphones." ...|$|E
500|$|These {{technical}} limitations forced Cerny {{to simplify}} the overall designs. Inspired by M. C. Escher, he designed abstract landscapes for the courses. In retrospect, Cerny partly attributed the designs to his limited artistic skills. He was {{a fan of the}} 3D graphics used in Battlezone and I, Robot, but felt that the visuals lacked definition and wanted to create a game with [...] "solid and clean" [...] 3D graphics. Unlike most other arcade games of the time, the course images were not drawn on the pixel level. Instead, Cerny defined the elevation of every point in the course, and stored this information in a heightmap array. The course graphics were then created by a ray tracing program that traced the path of light rays, using the heightmap to determine the appearance of the course on screen. This format also allowed Cerny to create shadows and use spatial anti-aliasing, a technique that provided the graphics with a smoother appearance. Cerny's course generator allowed him more time to experiment with the level designs. When deciding what elements to include in a course, practicality was a big factor; elements that would not work or would not appear as intended were omitted, such as an elastic barricade or a teeter-totter scale. Other ideas dropped from the designs were <b>breakable</b> glass supports, black hole traps, and bumps and obstacles built into the course that chased the marble.|$|E
