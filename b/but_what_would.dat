By 1900, Northwestern had the third-highest student enrollment of any university in the nation. The Class of 1902 presented a drinking fountain, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> later become The Rock, to the university as a senior gift. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt visited campus.|$|E
25|$|By 1777, the Thirteen Colonies' {{rebellion}} {{was entering}} its third year. John Burgoyne's surrender at the Battle of Saratoga had signalled that {{the struggle against}} the American colonies was likely to prove longer and more costly than expected. British defeat had raised the prospect of French intervention and of a European war. North's government, fearful of war with France, sought reconciliation with the American colonies and was willing to grant a fair measure of autonomy to this end, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> be enough in 1775 would no longer suffice by 1778. North {{had no intention of}} offering independence, but in the wake of Saratoga and with the prospect of a French alliance, the Americans were unlikely to agree with lesser terms.|$|E
25|$|Protagoras {{states that}} he has two good pieces of {{evidence}} that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally feel as though someone is responsible for not knowing {{something that can be}} taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness in them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes that none of this is surprising, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> be surprising is if this were not the case (326e). He closes by addressing Socrates' question why, if virtue is teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment where a hypothetical city state is resting its survival as such to the skill of flute playing. Being {{the most important thing for}} that society, parents would be eager to teach the skill to their sons. Not everyone would be successful though, as we can imagine, as some would have a greater natural inclination than others and often the son of a good flute player would turn out bad and vice versa. Any of them however, even the bad ones, would be better than an average citizen in the real world which might have never been taught how to play. Same goes for virtue, it is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree, to the point that it seems like a part of human nature while it is not (327b–d).|$|E

In this seminal text Metzinger stressed the distance between their works and traditional perspective. These artists, he wrote, granted themselves 'the liberty of moving around objects', and combining many different views in one image, each recording varying experiences over the course of time.|$|E

Frank Smith appeared to put Ottawa ahead 1110, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have been his seventh goal of the game was disallowed by an offside call. The Wanderers responded with a [...] "furious attack", resulting in Lester Patrick scoring two late goals, leading Montreal to a 1210 series victory and the Stanley Cup. LeSueur was the first goaltender, and {{one of only two}} (with Hugh Lehman, 1909–10) to play for two different teams in Stanley Cup challenges in the same season.|$|E
2500|$|Even though Basayev had a $10 million bounty on his head, he gave an {{interview}} to Russian journalist Andrei Babitsky in which he described himself as [...] "a bad guy, a bandit, a terrorist ... <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> you call them?", referring to his enemies. Basayev stated each Russian had to feel war's impact before the Chechen war would stop. Basayev asked [...] "Officially, over 40,000 of our children {{have been killed and}} tens of thousands mutilated. Is anyone saying anything about that? ... responsibility is with the whole Russian nation, which through its silent approval gives a 'yes'." [...] This interview was broadcast on U.S. television network ABC's Nightline program, to the protest of the Russian government; on 2 August 2005, Moscow banned journalists of the ABC network from working in Russia.|$|E
2500|$|Cadwalader {{included}} with his letter a [...] "rough {{draft of the}} road from this place," [...] meaning from Crosswicks, where Cadwalader was at the time, to Princeton. The map was highly detailed. Cadwalader put numbers next to bridges, for example, to indicate the number of soldiers defending them. A block of text perpendicular to the others ran {{up and down the}} right side of the map, highlighting a road: [...] "This road leads to the back part of Princeton which may be entered anywhere on this side—the country cleared, chiefly, for about 2 miles... few fences." [...] The map was particularly helpful in that it displayed not what existed at the time Cadwalader drew it up, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> exist by the time General Washington could act on the intelligence it provided. In other words, the map was estimative, indicating [...] "works begun, and those intended this morning." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{production}} of the two operas turned Schubert's attention more firmly than ever {{in the direction of}} the stage, where, for a variety of reasons, he was almost completely unsuccessful. All in all, he embarked on twenty stage projects, each of them failures which were quickly forgotten. In 1822, Alfonso und Estrella was refused, partly owing to its libretto. Fierrabras (D 796) was rejected in the fall of 1823, but this was largely due to the popularity of Rossini and the Italian operatic style, and the failure of Carl Maria von Weber's Euryanthe. Die Verschworenen (The Conspirators, D 787) was prohibited by the censor (apparently on the grounds of its title), and Rosamunde, Fürstin von Zypern (D 797) was withdrawn after two nights, owing to the poor quality of the play for which Schubert had written incidental music. Of these works, the first two are written on a scale which would make their performances exceedingly difficult (Fierabras, for instance, contains over 1,000 pages of manuscript score), but Die Verschworenen is a bright attractive comedy, and Rosamunde contains some of the most charming music that Schubert ever composed. In 1822, he made the acquaintance with both Weber and Beethoven, but little came of it in either case. Beethoven is said to have acknowledged the younger man's gifts on a few occasions, but some of this is likely legend and in any case he could not have known the real scope of Schubert's music, especially not the instrumental works, as so little of it was printed or performed in the composer's lifetime. On his deathbed, Beethoven is said to have looked into some of the younger man's works and exclaimed: [...] "Truly, the spark of divine genius resides in this Schubert!", <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have come of it, if he had recovered, we can never know.|$|E
