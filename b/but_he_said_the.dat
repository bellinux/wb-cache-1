5|$|Opinions were {{generally}} favorable towards FreeSpace 2s multiplayer implementation. SquadWar received favorable {{responses from the}} reviewers who were impressed by its persistent nature and statistics tracking. While the required registration with PXO was considered a troublesome process by a few, the gameplay itself was a smooth experience with no lag at all. Other reviewers' experiences with lag were different. Reynolds of Combatsim.com said Internet gaming was laggy with ships jumping places, but LAN gaming was smooth sailing. GameSpy's reviewer said lag became more apparent on a dial-up connection during a multiplayer mission with four or more players. FiringSquad's reviewer's experience was similar <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> lag {{was not enough to}} hinder his enjoyment of the multiplayer action.|$|E
25|$|The {{war ended}} in a ceasefire, with neither side {{explicitly}} accepting the peace terms of the other. Although there were claims by the British that they had won the war, there were widely held views {{at the time they}} had suffered an unfavourable and humiliating result. Historians have also been divided on the result. Historian James Belich has claimed that the Māori succeeded in thwarting the British bid to impose sovereignty over them, and had therefore been victorious. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> Māori victory was a hollow one, leading to the invasion of the Waikato.|$|E
500|$|Three instrumentals {{featured}} on the Touring Band 2000 DVD ("Thunderclap", [...] "Foldback", and [...] "Harmony") come from the early Binaural sessions. Several songs were rejected from the album that eventually found their way on to the 2003 Lost Dogs collection of rarities. These include [...] "Sad", [...] "Hitchhiker", [...] "In the Moonlight", [...] "Education", [...] "Fatal", and [...] "Sweet Lew". [...] "Sad", originally called [...] "Letter to the Dead", was called [...] "a great pop song" [...] by Ament, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> song did not fit the album because the band does not [...] "really [...] very many pop records." [...] "Sweet Lew", about Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, was cut from Binaural {{because it did not}} fit the album according to Ament. [...] "Fatal" [...] was producer Tchad Blake's favorite song {{to come out of the}} recording sessions. [...] "Strangest Tribe" [...] and [...] "Drifting" [...] were also recorded around the time of the album's recording sessions, and both songs were released on the band's 1999 fan club Christmas single as well as Lost Dogs.|$|E

6000|$|The elder man {{gave him}} one of his staccato glances in which Burnamy fancied {{suspicion}} and even resentment. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> after <b>the</b> moment of reflection which he gave himself, [...] "Why, thank you, if you don't mind, really." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{another few}} moments the white-stemmed trunks fell aside again, and they drove out once more into clear and swiftly-flowing water. Then the Spaniards howled together, and Austin, twining {{his hand in}} the lanyard, unloosed the whistle, and hurled back a great {{vibratory}} blast at the beaten forest. It was, he admitted afterward, a somewhat feeble thing, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> felt <b>the</b> occasion demanded something then.|$|R
500|$|... "Two Weeks" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{praised the}} episode and specific elements of it, like Michael {{wandering around the}} office drunk {{and many of the}} documentary-style interviews, like Charles talking about his effect on women, Toby comparing Michael to a movie on a plane and Kevin being too lazy to compliment Michael in person. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> episode was [...] "elevated" [...] by Michael and Pam forming a partnership at the end: [...] "Steve Carell and Jenna Fischer are always brilliant in those moments when they have to show multiple emotions at once, so it was nice to finally see them get to do it side-by-side." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons said [...] "Two Weeks" [...] offered a change that would keep the series fresh and, although he said it was [...] "not a nonstop laugh riot", he said it [...] "highlights what The Office does that few other shows ever even attempt: incredibly humane, subtle moments that contrast with the kind of chaos only ever borne of monotony." ...|$|E
500|$|Band members {{maintained}} {{a low profile}} during the album's recording. Manson indicated that their website would be their [...] "only contact with humanity" [...] during this period. The album was recorded at several locations, including Death Valley, Manson's home in the Hollywood Hills, and Rick Rubin's Mansion Studio in Laurel Canyon. Locations were chosen for the atmosphere they were intended to impart to the music, and the band visited Death Valley {{a number of times}} to [...] "imprint the feeling of the desert into [...] minds", and to avoid composing artificial-sounding songs. Manson co-produced the album alongside mixing engineer Dave Sardy, while Bon Harris of electronic body music group Nitzer Ebb is credited with programming and pre-production editing. Experimental sound effects and acoustic songs were recorded using live instrumentation. Harris' programming skills would prove invaluable during the recording process, as he would take the natural sounds the band had been recording and reconstruct them into processed background effects. Manson also explained that the acoustic songs were [...] "acoustic" [...] {{in the sense that they}} were not recorded with electronic instruments, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> album's sonic landscape would be [...] "intrinsically electronic".|$|E
500|$|Brian Howard of The Journal News {{said the}} episode flowed well {{and he liked}} the payoff at the end when Pam joined Michael's new paper company, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> moments with Michael {{crawling}} on the floor felt like [...] "unnecessary padding". Nevertheless, he said, [...] "I’m looking forward to rewatching this episode, probably the first time I’ve done that since '.'" [...] Andy Shaw of TV Fodder said Michael was much more likable in [...] "Two Weeks" [...] than in other recent episodes, and said, [...] "Steve Carell was at his best, with great throwaway lines and getting {{to the heart of}} Michael's love for Dunder-Mifflin and paper." [...] Will Leitch of New York magazine said the episode marked a [...] "major step" [...] for the series and had some particularly sweet moments between Michael and Pam. He also particularly liked the moment when Charles Miner, who is played by the same actor who played drug dealer Stringer Bell on the HBO series The Wire, threatened to attack Michael: [...] "Michael Scott being beaten up by Stringer Bell. That's one for the TV annals." ...|$|E

50|$|Rada {{currently}} earns €120.000 per season, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> {{money is}} not important to him because it was his dream to play for Steaua in the UEFA Champions League. He was sure that he {{made the right choice}} because he also had offers from other teams.|$|R
500|$|Morton {{had been}} {{diagnosed}} with prostate cancer in 1973, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> disease was in its early phase and was still treatable. [...] In 1979, however, Morton died of the cancer at his home in Easton. [...] He is interred in Old Wye Cemetery in Wye Mills, Maryland.|$|R
500|$|Alan Sepinwall, {{television}} {{critic for}} The Star-Ledger, said the episode was satisfying, although {{he felt it}} was short on laughs, except for Jim's antics with the tuxedo and the episode's documentary-style interviews. Sepinwall particularly praised the twist of Michael quitting and said he looked forward to seeing where the subplot went. Jeff Labrecque said [...] "watching Jim flail for approval [...] one of the episode's most awkward delights", <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> episode was really about [...] "the type of man Michael Scott really is". Labrecque also said he looked forward to seeing how Michael regained his job, and raised the suggestion that the reason Michael clashed so much with Charles was because he was intimidated by the man's race. Brian Howard of The Journal News said, [...] "For 22 minutes of not much fun and only some funny, 'New Boss' was a pretty good episode." [...] He particularly liked the ending, which {{he said he did not}} see coming and served as a kind of redemption for Michael; Howard also liked Pam's documentary interviews and Jim's failed efforts to make a good impression to Charles. Several reviewers particularly praised the line about the [...] "two-way petting zoo", a zoo in which people pet the animals and the animals pet back.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Fatbeard" [...] was watched by 2.59 million overall households, {{according to the}} Nielsen ratings, making it the most-watched Comedy Central production of the week. The episode received generally positive reviews. Carlos Delgado of If magazine, who gave the episode an A- grade, particularly praised the Cartman and Ike characters and called the ending [...] "perfect". Delgado said of the show's creators, [...] "These guys see episode potential in nearly everything that passes through the news desk. And because South Park {{can be made in}} like a week—and I’m talking start to finish, from concept to finished product—they end up being the most socially conscious and timely show on television today." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode and the Somalian pirate song, and complimented the show for presenting the pirates as sympathetic human beings. Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club said the portrayal of Somalian pirates was a predictable storyline, but said he enjoyed the episode because of the pacing: [...] "Rather than a cobbled-together collection of gags, everything progressed very organically." [...] IGN writer Travis Fickett said the episode was amusing but not exceptional. Fickett enjoyed the takeover of the French vessel {{and the extent to which}} Cartman's delusion about pirates takes him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> pirate plot [...] "isn't entirely in good taste (and) it never really gathers a full head of steam".|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{said the}} series {{needs to find}} a way to {{distinguish}} Leslie from Steve Carell's Michael Scott from The Office, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> pilot episode was funny, particularly the Aziz Ansari character. Sepinwall also said The Office did not find its footing until the second season, so comparisons simply based on the pilot were not fair. (Ironically, most critics now agree that Parks and Recreation set a significantly higher standard after the second season.) Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times said the supporting cast needed stronger writing and reinforcements, but that Poehler was excellent in a lead role unique for women because it is based on weakness and wrongheadedness, but still a positive and strong part. Stanley said, [...] "The pilot episode isn’t perfect, but Ms. Poehler very nearly is." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday said Poehler has [...] "plenty of appeal here" [...] so he felt the show might have potential, but felt the pilot was for the most part a [...] "near knockoff" [...] of The Office. Likewise, Paige Wiser of the Chicago Sun-Times said [...] "so far it's a pale Xerox of the paper company", although she said [...] "there are lots of funny little moments that could add up to a great series." [...] Robert Bianco said the episode was not funny, and the way in which the scripts and supporting cast ridicule and ignore the Leslie character leaves a [...] "sour whiff of gratuitous cruelty." [...] He also called the pilot unoriginal and described it as [...] "a style in search of a show," [...] despite Poehler's likability. Similarly, Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said, [...] "Watching Poehler's pathetic character have her dreams stomped on by apathetic bureaucrats is off-putting, more so than Michael Scott's obliviousness," [...] although Owen said the Ansari character was amusing.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Roger Manno {{announced}} his candidacy for the House of Delegates. During his campaigning, {{he focused on}} education, access to affordable health care, and transportation. Manno supported the building of <b>the</b> Intercounty Connector, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> highway proposal included too many highway interchanges. Manno won the election.|$|R

2500|$|Cave, Danien. [...] (December 2014), The New York Times. [...] "Mr. Castro {{prioritized}} economics. He {{acknowledged that}} Cuban state workers needed better salaries and said Cuba would accelerate economic {{changes in the}} coming year, including an end to its dual-currency system. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> changes needed to be gradual to create a system of [...] "prosperous and sustainable communism." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 25, President Ma invited {{representatives of}} the student protests to his office for a {{dialogue}} over the controversial trade agreement [...] "without any preconditions", after the president said earlier he would not hold face-to-face talks. The student leader Lin Fei-fan accepted the invitation initially and agreed no preconditions should be set for the meeting, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> students wanted to discuss whether Taiwan needed new legislation to monitor all cross-strait agreements, and whether the CSSTA should be postponed until that legislation was introduced. [...] However, one day later, on March 26, the protest leaders rebuffed the invitation to meet despite earlier calling on President Ma to meet with them to answer their demands, as they feel Ma, who was the Chairman of the Kuomintang, was still controlling the Kuomintang legislators via the party regulations, so that the cross-party negotiations failed once again to reach a consensus on the protests and the pact.|$|E

6000|$|Wordsworth gave as {{the date}} of the {{composition}} of this poem <b>the</b> year 1805; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> of <b>the</b> following one, 'To a Young Lady, who had been Reproached for taking Long Walks in the Country'--"composed at the same time" [...] and [...] "designed to make one piece"--that it was written in 1803.|$|R
6000|$|The day after, however, {{came the}} long {{expected}} {{letter from the}} captain himself. It was to Mrs. Kendal, and she detected a shade of disappointment on her husband's face, so she would have {{handed it to him}} at once, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'No, <b>the</b> person to whom the letter is addressed, should always be the first to read it.' ...|$|R
60|$|He almost {{decided to}} draw upon Dryfoos for some money; {{he did not need}} any, <b>but,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> maybe <b>the</b> demand would act as a hint upon him.

60|$|A sharp {{exclamation from}} Mr. Tredgold stopped {{all but the}} first three words of Mr. Stobell’s retort, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> rest under his breath with {{considerable}} relish.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{went over}} myself, last week," [...] said a finely-built young sailor, [...] "and I prayed the captain, on my knees, {{to take me}} on board; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> tale had been full, long ago; and that so many were the {{applicants}} that Master Drake and himself had sworn a great oath, that they would take none beyond those already engaged." ...|$|E

60|$|The Marquis put {{his hand}} on the grey hairs of the old butler, and moved his lips, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> nothing: <b>the</b> power of speech for the time failed him; the energy he had displayed, and the {{excitement}} he had felt, had been too much for him, and he was unable to reply aloud to the blessing of his faithful servant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Seeing his nibs ain't my long suit these days. I may be wrong, but I got {{the idea}} there was a dead-line for me about three blocks away from the nursery.
