40|$|Well {{integrity}} affects safety, humans, the environment, production, reputations {{and assets}} value. The concept of well integrity {{in relation to}} human and organizational factors have gained considerable attention in the petroleum sector inNorway {{over the last few}} years. This is not without reason. Resent studies shows that a simple mistake like dropping a hammer, may not only be caused by the obvious direct cause like inattention but may be caused by several underlying causes such as deficiencies {{in the design of the}} drill floor, operating instructions, follow-up of safety notices, competence, planning and implementation, deficient management, and <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure.</b> Historical events like the Piper Alpha incident shows that this underlying causes or human and organizational factors are vital to develop and improve the systems. This means that by improving human and organizational factors may contribute to the improvement of well integrity. This thesis will explain the concept of human and organizational factors through a detailed literary survey. Different models and methods has been presented (the human performance model, Decision making, the "step ladder" decision model, performance influencing factors, human error causation paradigm, human-,technology- and organizational concept) to give the reader a decent understanding of the concept. It is important for this thesis that the reader is given a detailed insight in this aspect since most of the main objectives in this project is answered using these models and methods. Human error has been identified as a primary causal factor in 70 - 80 % of accidents in the oil and gas industry. Identifying and classifying the human and organizational factors of an accident is an effective tool to assist in the investigation process, the target training and make it easier to implement prevention efforts. Through discussions and careful analysis of five methods deemed fit for classification of human and organizational factors in the oil and gas industry, was the STEPP method identified as the best classification scheme for human and organizational factors relevant to well integrity in various phases of a well s life. Well integrity is vulnerable to unforeseen factors that have a critical influence on the work performance. Understanding these unforeseen factors and the relationship between themthrough a human, technological and operational perspective can give better working environment and an opportunity to improve the health, safety integrity, and work performance. Challenges reviled through the human, technological and organizational perspective was identified and categorised as: well control training and knowledge, well integrity training and courses, human computer interface, qualification and testing ofwell barrier elements, verification ofwell barrier elements, automation, national and international standard, well integrity management system, handover documentation and well barrier schematics. Challenges related to human and organizational factor at Veslefrikk has been identified using the humanerror causation paradigms. The different paradigms (the engineering error paradigm, the individual error paradigm, the cognitive error paradigm and the organizational error paradigm) look at the situation from different points of view. Veslefrikk have challenges related to the driller s chair, placement of communication equipment, disturbing elements, alarms with no essential function, drillers workload, service companies and their lack of risk understanding, difficulty in locating relevant procedures, the sheer amount of procedures, time pressure, installation specific training, experience and meetings is being prioritized ahead of actual drilling operation and the departure meetings are too general. Comparison with the overall industry shows that the HO factor situation on Veslefrikk is all in all better. Measures can be initiated to eliminate the identified challenges at Veslefrikk and in the overall industry...|$|E
40|$|Two {{security}} breaches, {{a continent}} apart. One {{could be a}} false alarm, writes Jack Waterford, but the other [...] . LOS ALAMOS, New Mexico, where they built the first atomic bomb, has been at a standstill for a week. Two computer disks containing classified information - {{no one is sure}} exactly what - have been missing for a fortnight or so, and the $ 2 billion-a-year weapons research facility is virtually shut down while everyone searches for them. According to the New York Times, it is not thought likely that they have been abstracted by a foreign spy, or even stolen. They’re probably around somewhere. It’s the third incident involving lost disks over the past year. The laboratory is now said to be conducting an inventory of approximately 40, 000 computer data storage devices that contain classified information. One official told the Times, ‘it’s reasonable to think that when you look under the rocks we will find other things’. The shutdown has been complete - down to public areas. ‘You start making exceptions, you create gaps,’ one official was quoted as saying. Some of the staff regard the shutdown as mere politics, designed to confect an atmosphere reminding everyone of the need for security. Managers are certainly on a drive to discover people careless with classified material and to get rid of them. That’s security. Jay Leno commented on American television that now Americans couldn’t even find their own weapons of mass destruction. It put me in mind of a tale I was told (someone later denied that it had happened in anything like the way I was told by a very, very good source) of a security lapse at the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet in Malcolm Fraser’s day. Some minor flap blew up one weekend, and a PM&C duty officer went to the classified safe to get some information he thought would be there. But it was not. The documents in question, stamped with labels such as AUSTEO, Top Secret, Oyster, and ‘handle via comint channels only’, were supposed to be locked in the safe, according to the register which recorded exactly who had sighted it, removed it and returned it. Not only was the document missing but so were a number of others. The departmental security officer was dragged in from his Saturday gardening. So was a horde of Australian Federal Police officers. The area was searched, as were many offices and desks. Nothing. The search was extended and worries ran deep. Some six or seven hours later, a (now late) member of the Prime Minister’s office, a high level adviser with strong foreign affairs and security connections, made a more-or-less social call to a PM&C officer, who told him that {{there was a bit of}} panic on about some missing documents. ‘Oh, I’ve got them here,’ said the adviser. Several carloads of police sped to his home and, by the version I have heard, actually putting a cordon about it. The document in question, and most of the others, were on the adviser’s dining room table, along with a stack of books, newspapers, dirty plates and wine bottles. A more extensive search of the house found about 40 more very sensitive documents lying about, some of which had obviously been there for years, and most of which had never been noticed to be missing, even with the elaborate record-in record-out procedures in operation. There was no suggestion whatever of their put to improper purpose; the officer in question, who certainly should have known better, was simply very careless. In just the same way, I wouldn’t mind betting that the missing disks of Los Alamos turn up, one of them perhaps propping up a desk with a wobbly leg and the other at the back of a drawer. In the nature of things one will not contain top-secret data anyway. It will have been wiped so that the officer in question could record details of his betting on college basketball. Things like this send a chill through departmental security officers and the security intelligence establishment. And not only because they underline how vulnerable the system can be, whatever formal protections (in some cases physical barriers) exist, but because they send an even deeper chill into the breasts of great and powerful friends, who share so much intelligence with us. Never mind, as Phillip Flood more or less pointed out last week, that much of this intelligence is wrong, or useless; some of it is very very important. The Americans, in particular, are obsessed about proper procedures for the handling of highly classified information. It was that very obsession which helped produce our Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in the 1940 s, after America formally refused to share intelligence information with us, and not only on the grounds that they could (very privately) prove that some of it had previously ended up in the hands of the Russians but because we actually had no formal rules and procedures for protecting secrets, for determining access, or being sure, at all moments, where documents were. Americans thought us all too laid back and relaxed, and some of the people in our midst (including in our defence and foreign affairs establishment and political offices) of all too dubious loyalty to the western-English-speaking alliance. They called the rules doctrine, and learning them ‘indoctrination’, and attached a great deal of significance to mechanical adherence to procedures, if only on the basis that <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> could be made a serious disciplinary offence and that, in theory, deviation from procedure ought to sound alarm bells. In America, they accompanied such rules with surprise inspections, polygraph tests, and regular positive vetting - procedures they have tried to impose on others as well. As it happens, the rules seem to have had little role in preventing leakages, even before the advent of the photocopier and other means of copying and transmitting information in documents without their necessarily being away from where they should have been. Familiarity breeds certain contempt. Americans were especially indignant at flagrant breaches of security by Britons, but, in recent times, it has been the British smiling as a large number of American intelligence officers have been caught selling documents, and, more often than not, to have ignored security for years but got away with it. Here in Australia there have been a number of cases of intelligence analysts removing documents for improper purposes without being caught by physical security procedures. And many many more cases of classified material being found other than where it should be by people who have breached the rules, but for no apparent improper purpose. And then, of course, there are improper purposes and improper purposes. No doubt the worst purpose is to put a document in the hands of some potential enemy, whether for money or ideology. Another is leaking information - in the process perhaps seriously compromising security - for some political purpose, payback or just sheer mischief. One alleged example of this involves the leaking of an Office of National Assessments report to a Melbourne Herald Sun controversialist, Andrew Bolt. This was for the purpose of discrediting Andrew Wilkie, who had resigned from ONA over the invasion of Iraq. The trail leads quickly back to the office of Alexander Downer, Minister of Foreign Affairs and, no doubt by accident, ‘intellectual’ soul mate of Bolt. The document was of reasonable vintage and all copies were accounted for, back in ONA. A few days before it leaked, a copy had been requested by Alexander Downer’s office. Downer has prevaricated and blustered in responding to parliamentary questioning about his, or his office, involvement in the breach of security involved. Luckily, however, the AFP investigation has been fruitless, even if, as one senior security official remarked to me this week, ‘a cop who couldn’t solve this one couldn’t find his bum with both hands’.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{intended}} to discover a unified and scientific theory <b>of</b> <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> criminal <b>procedure</b> and their results. In Chapter One, I provide readers with a way of navigating the argument. In Chapter Two, England, Germany and China are the representative jurisdictions. I then try to harmonise ‘criminal procedure’ and ‘xing-shi su-song-fa’ in Chinese. In Chapter Three, a criminal procedure rule is composed of a procedural direction and the consequence <b>of</b> its <b>breach.</b> Weaknesses in procedural remedies exist in every jurisdiction. In Chapter Four, two obstacles are cleared up: the Anglo-American suspicions about universal legal theory and the antagonistic position between socialist and capitalist laws. Two scientific factors are found: three objectives of criminal procedure: substantive truth, procedural regularity and legal harmony; criminal procedural conduct as the analytical unit. In Chapter Five, civil juristic act theory cannot be mechanically transplanted. Two categorisations are found useful: disposition-influencing conduct, procedure-inducing conduct and adjudicative conduct; conduct by a person in authority and conduct by a person not in authority. In Chapter Six, there are simply proclaimed rules and nullity-backed rules. <b>Breaches</b> <b>of</b> nullity-backed rules can be either absolutely null or relatively null. The treatment of relatively null conducts is either nullification or regularisation. There are three conventional nullifications: reversal of adjudicative conduct; exclusion of disposition-influencing conduct and nullification of procedure-inducing conduct. Regularisation is divided into disposal and overlooking. If substantive aspects are examined, mitigation of sentence and ending of proceedings may be applied. Transmutation of invalid procedural conduct is a peculiar treatment. Then, I briefly integrate the subordinate procedural mechanisms in terms of institutional arrangements and structural constraints. In Chapter Seven, I explore the function of this theory in terms of theoretical guidance, legislation and legal practice, although discretion is unavoidable for deciding the final consequence <b>of</b> many <b>breaches.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
