He landed on her bed and noticed that she was wearing the necklace, the clasp turned downward. Loki turned into a flea and jumped onto Freyja's cheek and there <b>bit</b> <b>her.</b> Freyja stirred, turning about, and then fell asleep again. Loki removed his flea's shape and undid her collar, opened the bower, and {{returned}} to Odin.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the idea}} of working with {{resistance}} is essentially a hypnotic one, it goes beyond hypnosis and trance. In a typical example, a girl that <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> nails was told that she was cheating herself of really enjoying the nail biting. He encouraged her to let some of her nails grow a little longer before biting them, so that she really could derive the fullest pleasure from the activity. She decided to grow all of her nails long enough that she might really enjoy biting them, and then, after some days, she realised that she didn't want to bite them anyway.|$|E

Hades relented and let Orpheus bring Eurydice back, on the {{condition}} that he never once look back until outside. Unfortunately, near the very end, Orpheus faltered and looked back, causing Eurydice to be left in the Underworld forever. Orpheus spent {{the rest of his life}} strumming his lyre while wandering aimlessly through the land, rejecting all marriage offers from women.|$|E
25|$|Elliott was on {{the verge}} of winning her 15 & Over girls' Main at the 1989 ABA Grand Nationals in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; however, fate <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> again as it did at the Fall Nationals. She fell doing a trick over a jump. She landed badly, and crashed. The rest of the pack passed her, and her chance of being the Grand National winner went with them. Mapuana Naki won the National number one girl title for 1989. Elliot was not in {{contention}} for the title, since she didn't resume racing until October 1989. After racing one or two more times on the national level, Elliott continued her BMX retirement in February 1990.|$|E

Due to many people missing, she collected a large sum of money in her boat. However, Lü Dongbin, one of the Eight Immortals, helped a merchant hit Guanyin in the hair with silver powder, which floated away in the water.

The snake and Chen were to be mortal enemies. The merchant was sent to be reborn as Liu Qi (劉杞).|$|E

25|$|The body found beside Alistair in the {{original}} investigation was not that of his wife, but that of Dorothea; Margaret had died a month earlier {{at the hands of}} her sister, who fatally injured her as part of a psychotic episode. Before she died, she made her husband promise to protect her sister from arrest, to which both he and Zélie concealed the truth by planting Margaret's body {{at the foot of a}} cliff and fabricating the story that it was Dorothea who had died. Dorothea then took her sister's place. While she fooled the servants easily, she could not fool the Ravenscrofts' dog, which could distinguish between the sisters, thus explaining why it <b>bit</b> <b>her.</b> A month later, Alistair murdered her to prevent her from injuring anyone else, making certain she held the revolver before she was killed, and then committed suicide afterwards. Desmond and Celia recognise the sadness of the true events, but now knowing the facts are able to face a future together.|$|E
25|$|After a pre-game {{performance}} of the Texas ATCU game in December, Reveille's nervous, high-pitched barks could be heard above the band. It was decided by administrators and the Corps of Cadets that she be sent to obedience school. She worked closely with her professional trainer, Dr. Kay Stephens, and her newly appointed mascot corporal throughout the summer for her return for football season. Despite several stints in obedience school, Reveille's manners at times needed work. Though other incidents have been suspected, in 2007, {{it was reported that}} Reveille VII <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> handler after having her tail stepped on during a morning run. On February 13, 2008, her impending retirement {{at the end of the}} school year was announced at a news conference at the Corps Center. In the summer of 2008, she began her retirement at the age of 7 living with two other dogs under the care of Paul and Tina Gardner in Wellborn, Texas.|$|E
500|$|Tess Harper was {{performing}} {{on stage in}} Texas when she attended a casting call for a minor role in the film. Beresford {{was so impressed with}} her that he cast her in the lead. He later said that the actresses he had seen before her demonstrated a sophistication and worldliness inappropriate for the part, while she brought a kind of rural quality without coming across as simple or foolish. Beresford said of Harper, [...] "She walked into the room and even before she spoke, I thought, 'That's the girl to play the lead. Harper said she knew she won the role when Beresford appeared on her doorstep with a bottle of champagne in each hand. Tender Mercies was Harper's feature film debut, and she was so excited about the role she <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> script {{to make sure it was}} real.

While they are not aggressive carnivores like the piranha, their crushing jaw system, used primarily for eating seeds and nuts, can be hazardous. One toddler needed surgery after a pacu (misreported as a piranha) <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> finger at Edinburgh Butterfly and Insect World in Scotland. Commenting on the incident, Deep Sea World zoological manager Matthew Kane warned, [...] "Pacus will eat anything, even children's wiggling fingers." ...|$|E

Despite the fact that she often ingests high-amounts of junk food on a daily basis, she seems to keep her weight under control, perhaps because she {{does not seem to have}} proper meals. According to Fey, the character is not bulimic; [...] "she just likes to eat". Liz does have some knowledge of cooking, though she admits to only using her oven to warm her jeans in the morning. She is allergic to both dogs and cats, as well as [...] "anything warm and adorable". However, she does believe her allergy to dogs is psychosomatic, as she mentions that a dog <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> during the time of her first period.|$|E

2500|$|Bella's human ability {{shielded}} {{her from}} psychic powers, {{but as a}} vampire she learns she can project it to shield others in a wide radius, a secret weapon that neutralizes most of the Volturi's powers. Upon confronting the gathered Cullen allies and witnesses, the Volturi discover {{that they have been}} misinformed on Renesmee's identity, and execute Irina when she refuses to make a claim against the wolves for killing Laurent, trying unsuccessfully to instigate a full battle. Additionally, Caius brings up the Cullens' pact with the Quileute as allying with the vampires' sworn enemy, the Children of the Moon, but it turns out the Quileutes are [...] "shapeshifters" [...] that chose the form of giant wolves, and not Lycans. The Volturi remain undecided on whether Renesmee should be viewed as a threat to vampires' secret existence. At that time, Alice and Jasper, who had left prior to the gathering of the Cullen's allies, return with a Mapuche called Nahuel, a 150-year-old vampire-human hybrid like Renesmee, and his biological aunt, Huilen. Huilen tells of how her sister {{fell in love with a}} vampire and became pregnant with his child. She also shares that when Nahuel was born, he <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> and made her immortal. Nahuel demonstrates that the hybrids pose no threat, and the Volturi agree to leave the Cullens alone. Before the Volturi leave, he also informs them of his father's intent to create more hybrids to produce a [...] "super race." [...] While allowing them to deal with his father, Nahuel begs the Volturi to spare his sisters. The Cullens and their allies return to their homes in peace, accepting that the Volturi may one day return. When Edward and Bella are alone, she lets him read her mind for the first time, sharing her feelings about him from her memories.|$|E
