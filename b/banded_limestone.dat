Its pointed and moulded arched {{entrance}} is supported by octagonal pillars. Remains of mass dials (sundials) are {{at the right of}} the entrance. The interior contains two stone benches, one each side. The nave door within the porch incorporates large elaborate wrought iron hinges, and is set within a moulded cusped (lobed) door surround. Above the surround is a gabled and crocketed relief moulding, within which sits a figure of the Virgin Mary. The entrance and the gabled relief are bordered left and right by buttresses, topped by pinnacles truncated by the roof. A grant to St Vincent’s from the Incorporated Church Building Society (established 1818), later managed by the Historic Churches Preservation Trust and today the National Churches Trust, is noted in an inscription in the porch: [...] "The Incorporated Society for Building for Churches grant £1,100 towards enlarging this Church upon condition that 282 seats numbered… to… be reserved for use of the poorer inhabitants of this parish".|$|E

50|$|To {{the south}} of the church, across the churchyard, is the bede house, also a Grade I listed building. Built in about 1428 it was {{restored}} in the 19th century. It is of squared coursed and <b>banded</b> <b>limestone</b> and ironstone, with a plain tile 20th-century roof. It is not used as the church hall.|$|E
50|$|The William C. Boydell House is {{a three-story}} brick and {{limestone}} Beaux-Arts double {{house with a}} hip roof, built to resemble a single-family home. The front façade is lined {{with a pair of}} rock-faced terraces, and the front of the two units are unified in appearance by a brick frieze running under the eaves and <b>banded</b> <b>limestone</b> at the first story.|$|E
50|$|The {{house is}} {{constructed}} in yellow and grey <b>banded</b> <b>limestone</b> ashlar with a roof {{is made of}} stone slate. The style is Neo Gothic, the architectural historian Sir Charles Eastlake noting significant Ruskinian influences. Eastlake provides support for Pickford and Pevsner in attributing the house, called Eatington Park in the mid-19th century, solely to Prichard. The house is a E-shape plan, with two storeys and attics. The interior retains much of its original early and mid Victorian configuration and fittings. The Staircase Hall is of 1810-11, while the Library was decorated in 1820. The Long Gallery and the Great Drawing Room are part of Prichard's remodelling.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the land}} is made almost entirely of boulder clay with the {{exception}} of the slim <b>bands</b> of <b>limestone,</b> marls and sands along the valley of the Willow Brook.|$|R
50|$|The Briar Creek Reservoir {{is almost}} entirely {{surrounded}} by shale. However, a <b>band</b> of <b>limestone</b> occurs {{to the south of}} the lake. Much of the land in the lake's vicinity is non-agricultural grassland.|$|R
25|$|In 1812 the Crown Estate sold 12,000 {{acres of}} forest land in Fforest Fawr to John Christie, an {{industrialist}} and entrepreneur. Christie {{thought that the}} <b>band</b> of <b>limestone</b> lying across the area was a commercial opportunity.|$|R

50|$|The {{geological}} formation {{in and around}} the lake consists of marls, siltstones, gypsum/anhydrite, and <b>limestone</b> <b>bands,</b> but mostly silts.|$|R
25|$|At {{the very}} top of the hill of Corton are the densely covered {{woodland}} known as the Bois de Corton. On the slopes just below the woodland, most of the clay topsoil has eroded away leaving a narrow <b>band</b> of oolitic <b>limestone</b> mixed with marl. This <b>band</b> of <b>limestone,</b> which has a radial exposition of 270 degrees stretching from the east-facing lieu-dits of Bassess Mourottes and Hautes Mourottes above Ladoix-Serrigny to down south and west to northwest facing lieu-dits of Le Charlemagne above Pernand-Vergelesses, is most suited for white wine grape varieties and have historically been the source for Corton-Charlemagne wine.|$|R
50|$|Famenne is traversed by the Calestienne, a <b>band</b> of <b>limestone</b> {{resulting}} in calcium-rich soil and a corresponding concentration of calcicole plants. The rivers Lesse and Lomme cross the Calestienne, forming substantial cave systems. The caves of Han-sur-Lesse, the caves of Hotton and Rochefort's Lorette cave {{are the most}} notable examples.|$|R
50|$|The Poldens are a low narrow {{ridge of}} Blue Lias with {{alternating}} <b>bands</b> of <b>limestone</b> and clay. Blue Lias {{is believed to}} have been quarried on the Polden Hills in the 15th century; and was quarried in Puriton from the early 19th century until the 1973, when the local cement works closed.|$|R
50|$|On a {{regional}} scale, the long, irregular <b>band</b> of <b>limestone</b> containing Sima Pumaqucha {{and several other}} caves runs roughly south-southeast to north-northwest. The Pumaqucha waters sink at an elevation of 4,375 m above sea level, and are thought to resurge in the Rio Alis valley some 14 km to the north at an elevation of about 3,300 m above sea level.|$|R
50|$|The 1206 yd Whitrope Tunnel was the route's most {{significant}} engineering work and was bored {{through a combination}} of old red sandstone conglomerate resting on clay slate, stratified sandstone and beds of shale intermixed with <b>bands</b> of <b>limestone</b> and sandstone. The Waverley Route's only other significant tunnel was the 249 yd Bowland Tunnel which traversed the 'bow' of Gala Water by Bowshank.|$|R
25|$|Moenkopi Formation (Triassic): Chocolatey-red {{and white}} <b>banded</b> mudstone, shale, <b>limestone,</b> and {{siltstone}} containing thick layers of gypsum, exposed at Bloomington, South Bloomington Hills, {{and the south}} side of Webb Hill.|$|R
50|$|Its bedrock {{lithology}} {{is dominated}} by Upper Triassic period basalt at and around the summit. This formation is bordered on the west by Jurassic period volcanics which are of more variable composition. To the north, east and south is a complex of Pennsylvanian age argillite, chert, diabase and greywacke. A <b>band</b> of <b>limestone</b> lies within this complex on the southeast side between 550 and 610 m.|$|R
50|$|It occurs within {{phlogopite}} {{veins in}} the light-coloured band {{of green and}} white <b>banded</b> metamorphosed Devonian <b>limestone</b> which has been intruded by beryllium-bearing granite. Associated mineral include fluorite, liberite, chrysoberyl, taaffeite and nigerite.|$|R
5|$|The North Somerset Levels are to {{the east}} of Weston-super-Mare, while the Axe valley is {{separated}} by the Isle of Wedmore from the Brue valley. The latter is separated by the Polden Hills from the main wetland of the Parrett/Tone/Cary valleys. The Poldens are a low narrow ridge of Blue Lias with alternating <b>bands</b> of <b>limestone</b> and clay. Because {{of the nature of the}} Levels and Moors, the Poldens have a significant visual impact.|$|R
50|$|Manor Farmhouse, in High Street, is a {{good example}} of <b>banded</b> {{ironstone}} and <b>limestone,</b> and has a datestone of 1675. Originally called Warren Farm, it overlooked Warren Field, which suggests that this was where the medieval manor obtained its rabbits.|$|R
50|$|The 120 m isthmus which {{joins the}} {{limestone}} to the chalk {{is made of}} a 50 m <b>band</b> of Portland <b>limestone,</b> a narrow and compressed band of Cretaceous Wealden clays and sands, and then narrow bands of greensand and sandstone.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{building}} {{stone in the}} Severn Vale is scarce, necessitating brick or half-timbered construction in the main, although along the scarp mentioned above harder <b>limestone</b> <b>bands</b> in the Lower Lias (known as 'Blue Lias') {{have been used in}} vernacular building.|$|R
500|$|The hall tie has {{the golden}} sun of the Wills family {{placed on a}} red background. The red is the shade known as Bristol or [...] "Bristowe" [...] red, chosen by {{the founders of the}} University for the hoods of all Bristol graduates. [...] "Bristowe Red" [...] is {{supposed}} to recall the famous dye used in Mediaeval Bristol, but in fact Sir Isambard Owen, the Vice Chancellor from 1909 to 1921, took the shade from a <b>band</b> of <b>limestone</b> in the Avon Gorge.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bands</b> of <b>limestone</b> {{emerge from}} the Earth's surface in often {{spectacular}} rocky outcrops and islands. Examples include the Burren in Co. Clare, Ireland; the Verdon Gorge in France; Malham Cove in North Yorkshire and the Isle of Wight, England; the Great Orme in Wales on Fårö near the Swedish island of Gotland, the Niagara Escarpment in Canada/United States, Notch Peak in Utah, the Ha Long Bay National Park in Vietnam and the hills around the Lijiang River and Guilin city in China.|$|R

50|$|The cliff lies on {{the west}} bank of the Afon Dulas, which reaches the sea at Llanddulas, and is {{slightly}} inland of the belt of carboniferous limestone that runs along the coast from Great Ormes Head to Point of Ayr, about three miles west of Abergele. The Dulas passes through a gap in the limestone belt, the strata of which dip from the north or northeast. This <b>band</b> of <b>limestone</b> is less than a mile wide. The summit of the hill is 190 m above sea level.|$|R
50|$|The region drained by the Zambezi {{is a vast}} broken-edged plateau 900-1200 m high, {{composed}} in the remote interior of metamorphic beds and fringed with the igneous rocks of the Victoria Falls. At Shupanga, on the lower Zambezi, thin strata of grey and yellow sandstones, with an occasional <b>band</b> of <b>limestone,</b> crop {{out on the bed}} of the river in the dry season, and these persist beyond Tete, where they are associated with extensive seams of coal. Coal is also found in the district just below Victoria Falls. Gold-bearing rocks occur in several places.|$|R
50|$|Substation 219, {{also known}} as Harlem Substation, is a {{historic}} electrical substation located in Harlem, New York, New York. It was constructed by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company in 1932 to provide power to the IND Eighth Avenue Line. It is a single-story, double-height masonry building in the Art Deco style. It features a low brick parapet topped by a <b>band</b> of <b>limestone</b> coping and a limestone frieze consisting of diamond-shaped limestone pieces and a brick chevron pattern. The main entrance doors are faced in aluminium and incorporate Art Deco-style geometric motifs.|$|R
50|$|The geology of {{the parish}} {{consists}} of Oxford clay in the northwest, a <b>band</b> of Corallian <b>limestone</b> and sand running from southwest to northeast, and Kimmeridge clay in the southeast. Drainage consists of several small streams flowing northwest and north into the River Lydden and northeast into the River Stour.|$|R
50|$|The basal Hettangian-Sinemurian {{sequence}} is fully transgressive over basement rocks or Permo-Triassic sediments. At that time, the first open-marine sediments (yet rather poor in fossils) were being {{deposited in the}} Aquitaine Basin. The Lias Transgression, as it is also called, started to encroach on the entire Aquitaine during the Sinemurian, characterised by calcareous-dolomitic, partially oolitic sediments. Despite smaller regressions during the Pliensbachian {{towards the end of}} the Lias and at the beginning of the Dogger the sea had onlapped the basement rocks of the Massif Central and the western Vendée (reaching today's limits) by 30 km. On the Aquitaine Plateau in the north, an interior shelf was constructed as far south as the line La Rochelle-Angoulême-Périgueux-Figeac. On this shelf the generally detritic transgression sediments of the Hettangian normally comprise a base conglomerate, arkoses, and fairly thick layers of sand- and mud-stones rich in plant material. The rest of the Hettangian is made up of marine sediments deposited in a restricted environment (lagoonal) evolving towards a lacustrine facies (green shales, coloured marls, dolomitic limestones and platy limestones rich in dwarf fossils, and evaporitic interlayers). The sediments of the Sinemurian are again fully marine and carry a pelagic fauna (soft <b>banded</b> <b>limestones</b> and hard lithographic limestones). At the end of the Sinemurian, a sudden regression occurred, forming hardgrounds.|$|R
50|$|The Midvale Ridge is {{a natural}} region in South Central England formed by a <b>band</b> of low-lying <b>limestone</b> hills that run from {{southeast}} to northwest from the Vale of Aylesbury to Swindon. It has been designated as National Character Area 109 by Natural England, the UK Government's advisors on the natural environment.|$|R
