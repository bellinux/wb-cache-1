40|$|Abstract- The present {{water-tube}} boiler {{construction is}} based on membrane walls (tube wall panels) to form furnace envelope. <b>Buckstay</b> is a supporting element external to the boiler envelope stiffening the furnace against pressure differentials between gases inside the furnace and outside atmosphere. The membrane walls forming the furnace envelope alone could not withstand those pressure differentials. Hence membrane walls have been stiffened with the <b>buckstay</b> system placed to prevent large deformations. Buckstays are designed in accordance with any structural codes (IS 800, BS 5950 etc.) against shear, bending and axial stresses. Typical rolled & fabricated ‘I ’ sections {{may be used as}} <b>buckstay</b> beam. This technical paper provides applicable loadings on <b>buckstay,</b> design considerations design procedure and to reduce the weight of buckstays using castellated beams...|$|E
40|$|Membrane {{walls are}} very {{important}} structural parts of water-tube boiler construction. Based on their specific geometry, one special type of finite element was defined to help model the global boiler construction. That is the element of reduced orthotropic plate with two thicknesses and two elasticity matrixes, for membrane and bending load separately. A global model of the boiler construction showed that the high value of stress is concentrated in plates of the <b>buckstay</b> system in boiler corners. Validation of the new finite element was done on the local model of the part of membrane wall and <b>buckstay.</b> A very precise model of tubes and flanges was compared to the model formed on the element of a reduced orthotropic plate. Pressure and thermal loads were discussed. Obtained {{results indicated that the}} defined finite element was quite favorable in the design and reconstruction of the boiler substructures such as a <b>buckstay</b> system.
