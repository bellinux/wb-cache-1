5|$|Coastal Command {{had agreed}} to provide three {{squadron}}s of Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers. The Fleet Air Arm (FAA) contributed one squadron of Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers. RAF Bomber Command had some 300 bombers on standby for any operation. There were problems, however. The Swordfish were very slow, and fighter escort of the aircraft was difficult. The Beaufort squadrons were all spread out and {{it was difficult to}} <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>together.</b> One squadron was based at Leuchers, Scotland, one at Thorney Island, Portsmouth, England, and one near St Eval, Cornwall, England.|$|E

And all along, the riveting friendship {{between the two}} polarized women and the events that <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>together,</b> keep tugging at your heart. Shreyas Talpade proves that (his previous film), Iqbal was no accident and Gul Panag gives {{one of the most}} convincing portrayals of her career. But, it is Ayesha Takia who simply blows your breath away. Her journey from joyous subjugation — where she is content to dance before her husband and be at the beck and call of her in-laws — to silent emancipation is absolutely endearing.|$|E
5|$|The {{fusion of}} two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an {{exothermic}} process that releases {{more energy than}} is required to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>together.</b> It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in stars a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and atomic masses higher than about 60, is an endothermic process. These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star.|$|E

5|$|Terry-Thomas {{was born}} Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens at 53 Lichfield Grove, Finchley, North London. He {{was the third}} of four {{children}} born to Ernest Frederick Stevens, managing director of a butcher's business at Smithfield Market and part-time amateur actor, and his wife Ellen Elizabeth Stevens (née Hoar). As a child, Terry-Thomas was {{often referred to as}} Tom, the diminutive used by his family. He led a generally happy childhood, but believed that his parents secretly desired a daughter in his place. By the time he reached adolescence, his parents' marriage had failed and both became alcoholics. In an attempt to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>together,</b> Terry-Thomas often entertained them by performing impromptu slapstick routines, reciting jokes and singing and dancing around the family home. The performances seldom worked, and his father became increasingly removed from his family. His parents had divorced by the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|In the parashah, Moses {{told the}} Israelites {{that all the}} people stood before God {{to enter into the}} covenant, {{violation}} of which would bring on curses, but if they returned to God and heeded God’s commandments, then God would take them back in love and <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>together</b> again from the ends of the world. Moses taught that this Instruction was not beyond reach, and Moses put before the Israelites life and death, blessing and curse, and exhorted them to choose life by loving God and heeding the commandments.|$|E
25|$|At the Soviet {{equivalent}} of Los Alamos, Arzamas-16, physicist Yuli Khariton led the scientific {{effort to develop}} the weapon. Beria distrusted his scientists, however, and he distrusted the carefully collected espionage information. As such, Beria assigned multiple teams of scientists to the same task without informing each team of the other's existence. If they arrived at different conclusions, Beria would <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>together</b> {{for the first time}} and have them debate with their newfound counterparts. Beria used the espionage information as a way to double-check the progress of his scientists, and in his effort for duplication of the American project even rejected more efficient bomb designs in favor of ones that more closely mimicked the tried-and-true Fat Man bomb used by the U.S. against Nagasaki.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, British comedian Justin Lee Collins went {{searching for}} all the stars of Dallas to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>together</b> for a special reunion party. The show was {{broadcast}} at 9 p.m. Sunday, May 27, 2007, on UK television network Channel 4 {{as part of the}} Bring Back... series. After hunting down most of the main cast by any means necessary (e.g., climbing over security fences and ambushing hotels), Collins interviewed them and gained more knowledge about some of the decisions made throughout the show's seasons. The participants amongst the cast were Larry Hagman, Linda Gray, Patrick Duffy, Ken Kercheval, Charlene Tilton, Susan Howard and Mary Crosby. He held his own Oil Baron's Ball, where none of the main cast turned up. However, the actor who played baby Christopher (Eric Farlow) attended. Charlene Tilton spoke in an interview in 2011 about the program, which she said was one of her and the cast's worst experiences ever.|$|E
25|$|Freder recovers {{and returns}} to the catacombs. Finding the false Maria urging the workers to rise up and destroy the machines, Freder accuses her of not being the real Maria. The workers follow the false Maria from their city to the machine rooms, leaving their {{children}} behind. They destroy the Heart Machine, which causes the workers' city below to flood. The real Maria, having escaped from Rotwang's house, rescues the children with the help of Freder. Grot berates the celebrating workers for abandoning their children in the flooded city. Believing their children to be dead, the hysterical workers capture the false Maria and burn her at the stake. A horrified Freder watches, not understanding the deception until the fire reveals her to be a robot. Rotwang chases the real Maria to the roof of the cathedral, pursued by Freder, and the two men fight as Fredersen and the workers watch from the street. Rotwang falls to his death. Freder fulfills his role as mediator by linking the hands of Fredersen and Grot to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>together.</b>|$|E

To his surprise, she begins {{to talk to him}} very earnestly about duels and how to load a pistol. They are interrupted by General Yepanchin who wants Myshkin to walk with him. Aglaya slips a note into Myshkin's hand as they leave. The General is greatly agitated by the effect Nastassya Filippovna's behavior is having on his family, particularly since her information about Yevgeny Pavlovich's uncle {{has turned out to be}} completely correct. When the General leaves, Myshkin reads Aglaya's note, which is an urgent request to meet her secretly the following morning. His reflections are interrupted by Keller who has come to offer to be his second at the duel that will inevitably follow from the incident that morning, but Myshkin merely laughs heartily and invites Keller to visit him to drink champagne. Keller departs and Rogozhin appears. He informs the Prince that Nastassya Filippovna wants to see him and that she has been in correspondence with Aglaya. She is convinced that the Prince is in love with Aglaya and is desperately seeking to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>together.</b> Myshkin is perturbed by the information, but he remains in an inexplicably happy frame of mind and speaks with forgiveness and brotherly affection to Rogozhin. Remembering it will be his birthday tomorrow, he persuades Rogozhin to join him for some wine.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after {{release of}} Rock Band 3, Harmonix {{began work on}} Rock Band Sessions. Instead of {{matching}} notes as in the main games, Sessions would have players making their own music in songs where several of the other instrument tracks were already completed; one example given by Daniel Sussman was to complete a bass line atop existing guitar, drums, and vocal tracks. If the player opted, {{they would have been}} able to allow the pre-existing track to be played instead and only provide their own music in certain sections of the song. Sessions was originally conceived as a multiplayer title but Harmonix found that having multiple players attempt to make their own music at the same time was too chaotic, and instead reworked it as a single-player game, with the player able to work each track separately and eventually <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>together</b> in a final song. Though Harmonix had developed a working prototype for the game, they found that it would not adapt well to their existing licensed song library and would be difficult to use in future Rock Band games, and that they did not feel this was a type of game they could sell to their player base at full price. Sessions has been shelved, though some of the lessons they learned were used to help develop Rock Band 4, and may come back to the title at a later date.|$|E

500|$|The game {{opens with}} a battle between the {{respective}} Champions of Light and Darkness {{in front of the}} Mana Tree. While they are fighting near a Mana waterfall, they are swept by it into the mortal world. There, their power is drastically diminished and their existence is threatened. The two decide to make a temporary alliance, sharing a body until they can find their way back to the spirit world. During their journey, they become the protectors of a local village. The pair eventually become the heirs to the mystical Mana Sword. The main campaign was delivered in chapters. The original main campaign, which involved a battle with the hostile Folon, lasted for twenty chapters. Following this, new campaign missions were issued following the characters' mission to confront threats using the Mana Sword. At the end of the game, the Champions confront Folon at the Mana Tree, along with Vibra and Toryu. After their final confrontation, Foron willingly disperses after she and Mana explain why they summoned the Champions: to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>together</b> through circumstance and pave the way for peace between the Rasta and Daruka.
