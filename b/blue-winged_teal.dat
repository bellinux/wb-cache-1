6000|$|My chief {{ambition}} was {{to shoot}} wild duck. My brother shot them in preference to anything else: {{they were so}} much esteemed {{and he was so}} much commended when he came in with a few in his bag that I looked on duck-shooting as the greatest thing I could go in for. Ducks were common enough with us and in great variety; I know not in what country more kinds are to be found. There were no fewer than five species of teal, the commonest a dark brown bird with black mottlings; another, very common, was pale grey, the plumage beautifully barred and pencilled with brown and black; then we had the <b>blue-winged</b> <b>teal,</b> a maroon-red duck which ranges from Patagonia to California; the ringed teal, with salmon-coloured breast and velvet-black collar; the Brazilian teal, a lovely olive-brown and velvet-black duck, with crimson beak and legs. There were two pintails, one of which was the most abundant species in the country; also a widgeon, a lake duck, a shoveller duck, with red plumage, grey head and neck, and blue wings; and two species of the long-legged whistling or tree duck. Another common species was the rosy-billed duck, now to be seen on ornamental waters in England; and occasionally we saw the wild Muscovy duck, called Royal duck by the natives, but it was a rare visitor so far south. We also had geese and swans: the upland geese from the Megellanic Straits that came to us in winter--that is to say, our winter from May to August. And there were two swans, the black-necked, which has black flesh and is unfit to eat, and the white or Coscoroba Swan, as good a table bird as there is in the world. And oddly enough this bird has been known to the natives as a [...] "goose" [...] since the discovery of America, and now after three centuries our scientific ornithologists have made the discovery that it is a link between the geese and swans, but is more goose than swan. It is a beautiful white bird, with bright red bill and legs, the wings tipped with black; and has a loud musical cry of three notes, the last prolonged note with a falling inflection.|$|E
50|$|As Pilling became {{well known}} in the bird {{breeding}} community, he was sought out as a mentor. In 1972, Paul Dye moved to Seattle for the purpose of learning the art and craft of bird breeding from the master.

40|$|Abstract Background This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to characterize Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates obtained from waterfowl from the Upper Midwest region of the United States. A total of 43 NDVs were isolated by inoculation of cloacal samples in embryonated chicken eggs. These isolates were obtained from 24 mallards, seven American green-winged teals, six northern pintails, four <b>blue-winged</b> <b>teals,</b> and two wood ducks. Partial sequences of fusion gene were analyzed to determine the pathotypes and genotypes involved. Results Deduced amino acid sequence of the cleavage site of fusion (F) protein revealed that all isolates had avirulent motifs. Of the 43 isolates, 23 exhibited sequence motif of 111 GGKQGRL 117 at the cleavage site, 19 exhibited 111 GEKQGRL 117 while one isolate showed 111 GERQGRL 117. Phylogenetic analysis based on comparison with different classes of NDVs revealed that all 43 isolates clustered with class II NDVs and none with class I NDVs. Within class II, five isolates were phylogenetically close to genotype I NDVs while the remaining 38 were close to genotype II. Conclusion We conclude that more than one genotype of NDV circulates in waterfowl in the Upper Midwest region of the US. Continuous surveillance may help better understand the epidemiology of NDVs maintained in wild bird populations and their relationship to NDVs in domestic poultry, if any. </p...|$|R
50|$|<b>Blue-winged</b> <b>teal</b> are {{generally}} the first ducks {{south in the}} fall and the last ones north in the spring. Adult drakes depart the breeding grounds well before adult hens and immatures. Most <b>blue-winged</b> <b>teal</b> flocks seen after mid-September are composed largely of adult hens and immatures. The northern regions experience a steady decline in <b>blue-winged</b> <b>teal</b> populations from early September until early November. <b>Blue-winged</b> <b>teal</b> in central migration areas tend to remain through September, then diminish rapidly during October, with small numbers remaining until December. Large numbers of <b>blue-winged</b> <b>teal</b> appear on wintering grounds in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas in September.|$|E
50|$|The {{onset of}} {{courtship}} among immature <b>blue-winged</b> <b>teal</b> often starts in late January or early February. In areas {{south of the}} breeding grounds, <b>blue-winged</b> <b>teal</b> are more active in courtship during the spring migration than are most other ducks.|$|E

40|$|Between 25, 000 and 30, 000 playa lakes {{are in the}} playa lakes {{region of}} the {{southern}} high plains (Fig. 1). Most playas are in west Texas (about 20, 000), and fewer, in New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Colorado. The playa lakes region {{is one of the}} most intensively cultivated areas of North America. Dominant crops range from cotton in southern areas to cereal grains in the north. Therefore, most of the native short-grass prairie is gone, replaced by crops and, recently, grasses of the Conservation Reserve Program. Playas are the predominant wetlands and major wildlife habitat of the region. More than 115 bird species, including 20 species of waterfowl, and 10 mammal species have been documented in playas. Waterfowl nest in the area, producing up to 250, 000 ducklings in wetter years. Dominant breeding and nesting species are mallards and <b>blue-winged</b> <b>teals.</b> During the very protracted breeding season, birds hatch from April through August. Several million shorebirds and waterfowl migrate through the area each spring and fall. More than 400, 000 sandhill cranes migrate through and winter in the region, concentrating primarily on the larger saline lakes in the southern portion of the playa lakes region. The primary importance of the playa lakes region to waterfowl is as a wintering area. Wintering waterfowl populations in the playa lakes region range from 1 to 3 million birds, depending on fall precipitation patterns that determine the number of flooded playas. The most common wintering ducks are mallards, northern pintails, green-winged teals, and American wigeons. About 500, 000 Canada geese and 100, 000 lesser snow geese winter in the playa lakes region, and numbers of geese have increased annually since the early 1980 ’s. This chapter describes the physiography and ecology of playa lakes and their attributes that benefit waterfowl...|$|R
40|$|Only {{once before}} has a nesting record of Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor) been {{reported}} in Lancaster County. This report is in The Nebraska Bird Review, December 1985.

The male phalarope came flying toward me from afar as I advanced eastward through the transition zone of the marsh. The lone male tries to lead me from the area with an aerial distraction display.
