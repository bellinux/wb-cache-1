50|$|A major book-feeding insect is {{the book}} or paper louse (also known as <b>booklouse</b> or paperlouse). These are tiny (under 1 mm), soft-bodied {{wingless}} Psocopterans (usually Trogium pulsatorium), which actually feed on microscopic molds and other organic matter found in ill-maintained works (e.g., cool, damp, dark, and undisturbed areas of archives, libraries, and museums), although they will also attack bindings and other book parts. The <b>booklouse</b> is not a true louse.|$|E
50|$|Liposcelis bostrychophila is {{a species}} of <b>booklouse</b> in the family Liposcelididae. It is known nearly {{worldwide}} as a common pest of stored products. It is especially prevalent in cereals.|$|E
50|$|Miffy's namesakes {{include a}} new species of <b>booklouse</b> from Peru. The insect was given the {{scientific}} name Trichadenotecnum miffy in 2008, because its epiproct, an appendage on its abdomen, resembles a small rabbit.|$|E
5000|$|Booklice {{range from}} {{approximately}} 1mm to 2mm in length (1/25" [...] to 1/13"). Some species are wingless {{and they are}} easily mistaken for bedbug nymphs and vice versa. <b>Booklouse</b> eggs take 2 to 4 weeks to hatch and can reach adulthood approximately 2 months later. Adult booklice can live for six months. Besides damaging books, they also sometimes infest food storage areas, where they feed on dry, starchy materials. Although some psocids feed on starchy household products, the majority of psocids are woodland insects with little to no contact with humans, therefore they are of little economic importance. They are scavengers and do not bite humans.|$|E
40|$|The {{superorder}} Psocodea has ~ 10, 000 described {{species in}} two orders: Psocoptera (barklice and booklice) and Phthiraptera (parasitic lice). One <b>booklouse,</b> Liposcelis bostrychophila and six species of parasitic lice have been sequenced for complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes; these seven species {{have the most}} rearranged mt genomes seen in insects. The mt genome of a barklouse, lepidopsocid sp., has also been sequenced and is much less rearranged {{than those of the}} <b>booklouse</b> and the parasitic lice. To further understand mt gene rearrangements in the Psocodea, we sequenced the mt genomes of two barklice, Psococerastis albimaculata and Longivalvus hyalospilus, the first representatives from the suborder Psocomorpha, which is the most species-rich suborder of the Psocodea. We found that these two barklice have the least rearranged mt genomes seen in the Psocodea to date: a protein-coding gene (nad 3) and five tRNAs (trnN, trnS 1, trnE, trnM and trnC) have translocated. Rearrangements of mt genes in these two barklice can be accounted for by two events of tandem duplication followed by random deletions. Phylogenetic analyses of the mt genome sequences support the view that Psocoptera is paraphyletic whereas Phthiraptera is monophyletic. The <b>booklouse,</b> L. bostrychophila (suborder Troctomorpha) is most closely related to the parasitic lice. The barklice (suborders Trogiomorpha and Psocomorpha) are closely related and form a monophyletic group. We conclude that mt gene rearrangement has been substantially faster in the lineage leading to the booklice and the parasitic lice than in the lineage leading to the barklice. Lifestyle change appears {{to be associated with the}} contrasting rates in mt gene rearrangements between the two lineages of the Psocodea...|$|E
40|$|The first {{representative}} of the <b>booklouse</b> genus Embidopsocus Hagen (Nanopsocetae: Liposcelididae) is documented from the blaue Erde of northern Europe.   Embidopsocus pankowskiorum Engel, new species, {{is similar to the}} related E. saxonicus Günther from the Bitterfeld deposits (so-called ‘Saxonian amber’) and E. eocenicus Nel et al. from Oise amber, but differs in details of antennal structure, setation, wing venation, and size.   The species is described and comments made regarding its character affinities to other fossil liposcelidids...|$|E
40|$|Booklice in {{the genus}} Liposcelis are pests of stored grain products. They pose a {{considerable}} economic threat to global food security and safety. To date, the complete mitochondrial genome {{has only been}} determined for a single <b>booklouse</b> species Liposcelis bostrychophila. Unlike most bilateral animals, which have their 37 mt genes on one circular chromosome, ≈ 15 kb in size, the mt genome of L. bostrychophila has two circular chromosomes, 8 and 8. 5 kb in size. Here, we report the mt genome of another <b>booklouse,</b> Liposcelis decolor. The mt genome of L. decolor has the typical mt chromosome of bilateral animals, 14, 405 bp long with 37 genes (13 PCGs, 22 tRNAs and 2 rRNAs). However, the arrangement of these genes in L. decolor differs substantially from that observed in L. bostrychophila and other insects. With the exception of atp 8 -atp 6, L. decolor differs from L. bostrychophila in the arrangement {{of all of the}} other 35 genes. The variation in the mt genome organization and mt gene arrangement between the two Liposcelis species is unprecedented for closely related animals in the same genus. Furthermore, our results indicate that the two-chromosome mt genome organization observed in L. bostrychophila likely evolved recently after L. bostrychophila and L. decolor split from their most recent common ancestor...|$|E
40|$|Crucial factors {{influencing}} the epidemiology of Rickettsia felis rickettsiosis include pathogenesis and transmission. Detection of R. felis DNA {{in a number}} of arthropod species has been reported, with characterized isolates, R. felis strain LSU and strain LSU-Lb, generated from the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, and the non-hematophagous <b>booklouse,</b> Liposcelis bostrychophila, respectively. While it is realized that strain influence on host biology varies, the rickettsial response to these distinct host environments remained undefined. To identify a panel of potential rickettsial transmission determinants in the cat flea, the transcriptional profile for these two strains of R. felis were compared in their arthropod hosts using RNAseq. Rickettsial genes with increased transcription in the flea as compared to the <b>booklouse</b> were identified. Genes previously associated with bacterial virulence including LPS biosynthesis, Type IV secretion system, ABC transporters, and a toxin-antitoxin system were selected for further study. Transcription of putative virulence-associated genes was determined in a flea infection bioassay for both strains of R. felis. A host-dependent transcriptional profile during bloodfeeding, specifically, an increased expression of selected transcripts in newly infected cat fleas and flea feces was detected when compared to arthropod cell culture and incubation in vertebrate blood. Together, these studies have identified novel, host-dependent rickettsial factors that likely contribute to successful horizontal transmission by bloodfeeding arthropods...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the chemical composition and insecticidal activity of the essential oil of Curcuma wenyujin Y. H. Chen et C. Ling rhizomes against the <b>booklouse</b> Liposcelis bostrychophila Badonnel and to isolate any insecticidal constituents from the essential oil. The essential oil of C. wenyujin rhizomes was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-MS. A total of 43 components of the essential oil were identified and the principal compounds in the essential oil were 1, 8 -cineole (15. 26 %), camphor (10. 12 %), germacrone (6. 86 %), &beta;-elemene (6. 33 %), curzerene (6. 70 %), and &beta;-elemenone (5. 23 %). followed by curzerenone (4. 52 %), curdione (4. 45 %) and linalool (4. 43 %). Based on bioactivity-guided fractionation, the two main active constituents were isolated from the essential oil and identified as 1, 8 -cineole and camphor. The essential oil of C. wenyujin rhizomes exhibited contact toxicity against L. bostrychophila with an LD 50 value of 208. 85 &micro;g/cm 2. Camphor (LD 50 = 207. 26 &micro;g/cm 2) exhibited stronger contact toxicity than 1, 8 -cineole (LD 50 = 1048. 75 &micro;g/cm 2) against <b>booklouse.</b> The essential oil of C. wenyujin (LC 50 = 2. 76 mg/L air) also possessed fumigant toxicity against L. bostrychophila, while the two constituents, camphor and 1, 8 -cineole had LC 50 values of 1. 03 mg/L air and 1. 13 mg/L air, respectively. The results indicate that the essential oil of C. wenyujin rhizomes and its constituent compounds have potential for development as natural insecticides or fumigants for control of insects in stored grains...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring our {{screening}} {{program for}} agrochemicals from Chinese medicinal herbs and wild plants, the essential oil of Litsea cubeba fruits {{was found to}} possess strong contact toxicity against the cigarette beetle Lasioderma serricorne adults and the <b>booklouse</b> Liposcelis bostrychophila, with LD 50 values of 27. 33 μg/adult and 71. 56 μg/cm 2, respectively, and also showed strong fumigant toxicity against the two stored product insects with LC 50 values of 22. 97 and 0. 73 mg/L, respectively. The essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation was investigated by GC MS. The main components of the essential oil were identified to be E-citral (geranial) (27. 49 %), Z-citral (neral) (23. 57 %) and d-limonene (18. 82 %) followed by β-thujene (3. 34 %), β-pinene (2. 85 %), α-pinene (2. 57 %), 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one (2. 40 %) and linalool (2. 36 %). Citral (Z/E-citral), d-limonene, β-pinene, α-pinene and linalool were separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography, and further identified by means of physicochemical and spectrometric analysis. Citral and linalool showed strong contact toxicity against L. serricorne and L. bostrychophila (LD 50 = 11. 76, 12. 74 μg/adult and 20. 15, 99. 97 μg/cm 2, respectively) and fumigant toxicity against L. serricorne and L. bostrychophila (16. 54, 18. 04 mg/L air and 0. 14, 0. 71 mg/L air, respectively). Otherwise, citral, d-limonene and linalool were strongly repellent against the cigarette beetle L. serricorne as the essential oil whereas β-pinene and α-pinene exhibited weaker repellency against the cigarette beetle compared with the positive control, DEET. Moreover, except α-pinene and linalool, the other three compounds {{as well as the}} essential oil exhibited comparable repellency against the <b>booklouse</b> relative to DEET...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The <b>booklouse,</b> Liposcelis bostrychophila, is an {{increasingly}} com-mon pest of stored food products worldwide. We report here the cuticular lipid composition of this pest (the first {{report of the}} hydrocarbons of {{any member of the}} Order Psocoptera and the first report of fatty acid amides as cuticular compo-nents for any insect). No unsaturated hydrocarbons were present. A homologous series of n-alkanes (C 21 –C 34), monomethyl alkanes (3 -, 4 -, 5 -, 7 -, 9 -, 11 -, 12 -, 13 - and 15 -methyl-) with a carbon chain range of C 28 –C 42, and dimethyl alka-nes (3, 7 -; 9, 13 -; 11, 15 -; 13, 17 -; 9, 21 -; 11, 19 -; and 13, 21 -) with a carbon number range of C 31 –C 43 were identified. The relative abundances of these hy-drocarbons were low, comprising approximately 0. 0125 % of total biomass. The amides were a homologous series (C 16 –C 22 in chain length), with the major amide being stearoyl amide. In addition to the amides, free fatty acids (C 16 : 1...|$|E
30|$|About 55 % of {{the traps}} {{of the more}} than 30000 traps {{examined}} over that period contained insects that were readily categorised. The rate of catch (insects/trap) was highest in London and the Southeast. Booklice (Liposcelis bostrychophila) and silverfish (Lepisma saccharina) were the most frequent catch. Woolly bear (Anthrenus spp.) larvae and crustacean woodlice (Porcellio spinicornis) were also common. A higher frequency of furniture beetles (Anobium punctatum) is notable in the Southeast and West. Despite this overall pattern, catch varied greatly between individual properties. The general view that insects have increased over time was not universal, although the dominant <b>booklouse</b> showed an increased catch over the last decade. The insects {{did not appear to be}} randomly distributed, but clustered onto traps in greater numbers than might be expected from a Poisson distribution, which suggested they occurred as infestations. Some insect species appeared in combination with other species at a higher frequency than expected, but the reasons for these associations were not always obvious. Pheromone traps collected more webbing and case bearing clothes moths (Tineola bisselliella, Tinea pellionella) than traps without attractants, much as expected. There are hints that covered traps may collect fewer insects than simple blunder traps.|$|E
40|$|The <b>booklouse,</b> Liposcelis bostrychophila, is a {{worldwide}} pest of stored products. For decades, only thelytokous parthenogenetic reproduction was documented in L. bostrychophila. Male L. bostrychophila were first found in Hawaii in 2002. In 2009, a sexual strain {{was found in}} Arizona. We examined the morphology of {{both males and females}} of the Arizona strain and compared the Arizona sexual strain with the Hawaii sexual strain and the parthenogenetic strains of L. bostrychophila. The sexual and parthenogenetic strains show some differences in eye morphology. To examine the relationship between sexual and asexual lineages, we sequenced the mitochondrial 12 S and 16 S ribosomal RNA genes of males and females from the Arizona strain. Phylogenetic analyses of L. bostrychophila individuals revealed that: 1) the sexually reproducing colony found in Arizona contains two closely related mitochondrial DNA haplotypes – one present in only females and the other in both males and females; and 2) the Arizona sexual strain was most closely related to a parthenogenetic strain in Illinois. We detected Rickettsia in all of the parthenogenetic individuals we checked but not in any Arizona sexual individuals. Further evidence is required to establish whether the presence of Rickettsia is linked to asexual reproduction in Liposcelis...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{analyses of}} 18 S rDNA {{have indicated that}} parasitic lice (order Phthiraptera) are possibly polyphyletic. These analyses recovered one of the parasitic louse suborders, Amblycera, as the sister group to the free-living <b>booklouse</b> family Liposcelididae. We further tested this hypothesis using DNA sequences from five genes: nuclear 18 S rDNA, Histone 3, and wingless and mitochondrial 16 S rDNA and COI. Combined analyses of these five genes provided reasonably {{strong support for the}} Amblycera + Liposcelididae clade, supporting the polyphyly of lice hypothesis. To explore the robustness of this result, we examined the phylogenetic signal contained in each gene independently (except for wingless, which could not be readily amplified in many target taxa). Analyses of each gene separately and in various combinations with other genes revealed that clear signal supporting Amblycera + Liposcelididae only existed in the 18 S data, although no analysis supported monophyly of parasitic lice. Nevertheless, combined analyses of all genes provided stronger support for this relationship than that obtained from 18 S data alone. The increase in support for this clade was mostly explained by the stabilization of other parts of the tree and potentially inappropriate substitution modeling.

40|$|The taxonomy, fossil record, phylogeny, and {{systematic}} {{placement of the}} <b>booklouse</b> family Liposcelididae (Insecta: Psocodea: ‘Psocoptera’) were reviewed. An apterous specimen from lower Eocene, erroneously identified as Embidopsocus eocenicus Nel et al., 2004 in the literature, is recognized here as an unidentified species of Liposcelis Motschulsky, 1852. It represents the oldest fossil of the genus. Phylogenetic relationships within the family presented in the recent literature were re-analyzed, based on a revised data matrix. The resulting tree was generally in agreement with that originally published, but the most basal dichotomy between the fossil taxon Cretoscelis Grimaldi & Engel, 2006 {{and the rest of}} the Liposcelididae was not supported. Monophyly of Liposcelis with respect to Troglotroctes Lienhard, 1996 is highly questionable, but the latter genus is retained because of lack of conclusive evidence. Paraphyly of Psocoptera (i. e., closer relationship between Liposcelididae and parasitic lice) is now well established, based on both morphological and molecular data. Monophyly of Phthiraptera is questionable, but support for the ‘Polyphyly of Lice Hypothesis’ is still not definitive. A checklist of valid names of all presently recognized Liposcelididae taxa (10 genera, 200 species) is also included with information on their geographical distribution. Because monophyly of the subfamily Embidopsocinae is highly questionable, we list the genera alphabetically without adopting the usual subdivision into two subfamilies...|$|E

The essential oil of A. calamus rhizomes was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. A total of 32 components of the essential oil of A. calamus rhizomes was identified and the principal compounds in the essential oil were determined to be α-asarone (50. 09 %), (E) -methylisoeugenol (14. 01 %), and methyleugenol (8. 59 %), followed by β-asarone (3. 51 %), α-cedrene (3. 09 %) and camphor (2. 42 %). Based on bioactivity-guided fractionation, the three active constituents were isolated from the essential oil and identified as methyleugenol, (E) -methylisoeugenol and α-asarone. The essential oil exhibited contact toxicity against L. bostrychophila with an LD 50 value of 100. 21 µg/cm 2 while three constituent compounds, α-asarone, methyleugenol, and (E) -methylisoeugenol had LD 50 values of 125. 73 µg/cm 2, 103. 22 µg/cm 2 and 55. 32 µg/cm 2, respectively.
