A group of people form a ring about the base of the pole and take a ribbon in hand. Half the people then travel clockwise and the other half counter clockwise. When the people pass one another they pass alternately to the right and to the left. This results in a downward forming braid on the pole. As the braid works its way down the pole, the ribbons become shorter and the angle of forming changes as the braid works lower on the pole.

This theory shows that DNA braiding may be affected, stabilized, or even driven by chiral electrostatic interactions.

30|$|In a real <b>braiding</b> <b>process,</b> {{the natural}} forming point occurs {{somewhere between the}} forming ring and the carriers. This {{position}} depends on parameters such as take-up speed, yarn fineness and yarn-to-yarn coefficient of friction. The smaller the take-up speed, the higher the coefficient of friction and the coarser the yarn, the closer the natural forming point will be to the carriers. In the FE model, the yarns were modelled as converging {{to the center of}} the braiding machine and, when the simulation started, they were pulled from the take-up node (Fig.  5 b) in the positive y-direction through the forming ring at a speed equal to the real braiding machine take-up speed υtu. Based on experimental observations, the position of the take-up nodes relative to the carriers was adjusted depending on the take-up speed to be as close as possible to where the braid would form in a real <b>braiding</b> <b>process.</b> Opposite to the take-up nodes, linear elastic springs modelled with discrete elements, were attached to each yarn end to simulate the carrier tensioning springs (0.2 N was the effective pre-tension applied by the springs to the attached yarns). These springs, as in a real carrier, were restrained to move in the y-direction during their movement on the x-z plane, and were used to maintain a uniform tension in the yarns throughout the braiding simulation. The tension of the yarns at the beginning of the virtual <b>braiding</b> <b>process</b> was not uniform among different yarns. This is because of the difference in the yarn length and the relative position of the yarns with respect to the forming point. In order to even out the tension in each yarn before the starting of the <b>braiding</b> <b>process,</b> the springs were pulled in the negative y-direction for two seconds while keeping the uppermost nodes fully constrained. From their initial position, the eyelets and the yarn ends with springs were moved along a prescribed path established by Eq. 10 on the x-z plane. Their velocity was equal to the maximum carriers’ velocity of the braiding machine used for the manufacture of microbraids.|$|E

This vertical sorting is important for analyzing braided river sedimentology, for numerical modeling of braided river morphodynamics, and for measuring and predicting bedload transport rate. We define the morphological active layer as the bed material between the maximum and minimum bed elevations at a point over extended time periods sufficient for <b>braiding</b> <b>processes</b> to rework the river bed. The vertical extent of the active layer was measured using 40 hourly high-resolution DEMs (digital elevation models) of the model river bed. An image texture algorithm was used to map bed material grain size of each DEM. Analysis of the 40 DEMs and texture maps provides data on the geometry of the morphological active layer and variation in grain size in three dimensions. By normalizing active layer thickness and dividing into 10 sublayers, we show that all grain sizes occur with almost equal frequency in all sublayers. Occurrence of patches and strings of coarser (or finer) material relates to preservation of particular morpho-textural features within the active layer.

Morpho-texture of braided streams refers to the morphological-textural {{organization}} in a braid-cell (stream section including bars, anabranches and chutes) that may strongly relate to different processes and hydrological regimes. The objective {{of this study is}} to compare the morpho-texture of braided streams governed by diverse flow recessions in different climates. Measurements were conducted in the wadis Ze’elimand Rahaf, southeast hyper-arid Israel, in the Mediterranean Barranca-de-los-Pinos, central Spain and in humid-temperate braided systems, the La-Bléone River, Haute-Provence, France and in the Saisera and Cimoliana torrents, northeast Italy. Terrestrial laser scanning was used to produce point clouds and high resolution digital elevation models of the braid-cells. Wet braid-cells in humid-temperate environments were surveyed by a Total Station. Roughness and the upper tail of grain size distributions were derived from the scanned point clouds or from Wolman sampling. We found that anabranches are commonly finer-grained than the bars in dryland systems and in semi-arid sandy braided systems, contrary to the humid-temperate braided systems. In both climates, chutes are similar or coarser-grained than the bars which they dissect, in accordance with their steeper gradients due to the considerable bar-anabranch relief. The Saisera’s morpho-texture is similar to that of the dryland braided channels, despite the very humid-temperate environment in which it is located, due to its short-lived, ephemeral type hydrograph. Hydrograph shape, specifically the duration of flow recession, typical of a climate but not confined to it, determines the morphotexture of braided streams and the textural differentiation between a depositional bar and the adjacent anabranches. The morphotexture of chutes and bars results also from local erosional processes affected by local topography, i. e. ungraded longitudinal profiles, and is not solely determined by flow recession.
