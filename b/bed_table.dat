25|$|Quarto do Rei D. Luís (King Luís's Room), {{covered in}} wood paneled wainscoting, painted white and gold remains {{as one of}} the few rooms in the Palace painted in its {{original}} un-restored wall colors. The painted ceiling, depicting an allegorical representation of Paz by Cyrillo Volkmar Machado that includes figures, mythical figures and flowers in each corner, while the main ceiling is designed as a fanciful open-air Cupola. The walls are painted simply in white with gold trim, divided in square panels, while the floor is paved in parquet. An ornate <b>bed,</b> <b>table</b> and white-velvet chairs decorate the room, with a writer’s desk along one wall, while statues stand in the window niches on the opposite wall from the bed. Paintings of many of the Portuguese monarchs are located on one of the walls, while over the desk the full-size painting of King Carlos of Portugal is hung.|$|E
2500|$|The {{woman can}} lie {{on her back}} with her hips {{on the edge of}} a {{platform}} such as a <b>bed,</b> <b>table,</b> kitchen bench, desk, etc. while the man penetrates her while standing. The woman can move her body freely. She can dangle her legs over the edge or raise them to any height or manner mentioned above. The woman can rest her legs on the man or he can hold them or separate them. The woman has a greater ability to move her pelvis and to arch her back, and the man can raise, support or [...] restrict the movement of her pelvis. The woman is not weighed down by the man's weight. This position, sometimes called the butterfly position, adds variety to the angle and depth of penetration and generally enables the man to withdraw and then fully thrust the penis, with faster and more forceful thrusts. The downside of this position is that the angle of penetration results in reduced clitoral stimulation, and the woman may need direct clitoral fingering, either by herself or by the man, to achieve orgasm. Alternatively, the woman may either arch her back or raise her torso onto her elbows or arms to reduce the angle and enhance clitoral stimulation. Also, prior to and after the man's orgasm, the man may need to lie down on the woman.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was placed}} in solitary {{confinement}} with clothing, a pallet <b>bed,</b> <b>table</b> and armchair in [...] "the worst of all the cells", where he suffered greatly from the darkness, summer heat and [...] "millions of fleas". He was soon housed {{with a series of}} cell mates, and after five months and a personal appeal from Count Bragadin was given warm winter bedding and a monthly stipend for books and better food. During exercise walks he was granted in the prison garret, he found a piece of black marble and an iron bar which he smuggled back to his cell; he hid the bar inside his armchair. When he was temporarily without cell mates, he spent two weeks sharpening the bar into a spike on the stone. Then he began to gouge through the wooden floor underneath his bed, knowing that his cell was directly above the Inquisitor's chamber. Just three days before his intended escape, during a festival when no officials would be in the chamber below, Casanova was moved to a larger, lighter cell with a view, despite his protests that he was perfectly happy where he was. In his new cell, [...] "I sat in my armchair like a man in a stupor; motionless as a statue, I saw that I had wasted all the efforts I had made, and I could not repent of them. I felt that I had nothing to hope for, and the only relief left to me was not to think of the future." ...|$|E

60|$|There {{was much}} to be done for him. The room was a very poor and bare one, rigidly clean, of course, but with hardly and {{furniture}} in it but a <b>bed,</b> <b>table,</b> and two chairs, and the mistress or her maid ruthlessly scoured it every morning, without regard to the damp that the poor patient must inhale.|$|E
60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour later half dozen men of the Republican Guard, with {{corporal}} and sergeant in command, were in the small apartment on the fifth floor of the tenement house in the Rue Jolivet. They had demanded an entry {{in the name of the}} Republic, had roughly hustled petite maman and Rosette, questioned them to Lenegre's whereabouts, and not satisfied with the reply which they received, had turned the tidy little home topsy-turvy, ransacked every cupboard, dislocated every <b>bed,</b> <b>table</b> or sofa which might presumably have afforded a hiding place for a man.|$|E
6000|$|Questioned {{about these}} improvements, she led us {{through to the}} back {{to show us the}} ground, about half an acre in extent, part of which was used as a paddock for the donkey, and on the other part there were about a dozen rather sickly-looking young fruit trees. Her husband, she said, had planted the orchard and kept the fence of the paddock in order, and they refused to {{compensate}} him! Then she took us up to the spare room, empty of furniture, the floor thick with dust. The <b>bed,</b> <b>table,</b> chairs, washhandstand, toilet service--the things she had been so long struggling to get together, saving her money for months and months, and making so many journeys to the town to buy--all, all he had taken away and sold for almost nothing! ...|$|E

Suddenly Mrs. Inglethorp awakens and is seized with an alarming paroxysm. She flings out her arm, overturning the <b>bed</b> <b>table,</b> and then pulls desperately at the bell. Mrs. Cavendish, startled, drops her candle, scattering the grease on the carpet. She picks it up, and retreats quickly to Mademoiselle Cynthia's room, {{closing the door behind}} her. She hurries out into the passage, for the servants must not find her where she is. But it is too late! Already footsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings. What can she do? Quick as thought, she hurries back to the young girl's room, and starts shaking her awake. The hastily aroused household come trooping down the passage. They are all busily battering at Mrs. Inglethorp's door. It occurs to nobody that Mrs. Cavendish has not arrived with the rest, but--and this is significant--I can find no one who saw her come from the other wing." [...] He looked at Mary Cavendish.
