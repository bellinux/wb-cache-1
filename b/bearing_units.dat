In the second example, the Low tone of the first syllable of ọ̀bẹ is not as easily deleted; it causes a downstep (marked by , a lowering of subsequent tones. The ease with which the Mid tone gives way is attributed to it not being specified underlyingly. Cf. Bamgboṣe 1966:9 (who calls the downstep effect 'the assimilated low tone').) Every syllable must {{have at least one}} tone; a syllable containing a long vowel can have two tones. Contour tones (i.e. rising or falling tone melodies) are usually analysed as separate tones occurring on adjacent tone <b>bearing</b> <b>units</b> (morae) and thus have no phonemic status.

40|$|Due to {{the high}} cutting speeds and depths of modern milling {{machines}} vibrations are generated within the whole machine structure. These vibrations lead to a poor machined surface and an additional load for all machine components. Within the collaborative research centre 368 “Autonomous Production Cells”, IFAS {{is involved in the}} development of an active spindle <b>bearing</b> <b>unit</b> which is capable of damping vibration without reducing milling efficiency [7]. The special layout of the “three cavity ring ” results in a high dynamic and stiffness, little need for space and a possible displacement of five tenth of a millimetre. A zero-leakage design is very important for the performance of the actuator. Reducing the leakage of the actuator will increase the dynamic and stiffness of the drive. Using a micro controller for controlling the <b>bearing</b> <b>unit</b> leads to a decentralised system with local intelligence, that can be integrated into a milling machine...|$|R

50|$|The tone <b>bearing</b> <b>unit</b> is a {{syllable}}, {{and each}} syllable is obligatorily assigned a tone. There are two tones with contrastive minimal pairs found in Ersu; high level, and mid level. The assignment of the tones {{in a particular}} morpheme or word is unpredictable, though data suggests that the high level tone is much more frequent than the mid level tone. The pitch contour of the Ersu tones is also much less stable/consistent compared to Mandarin Chinese, and often have contextual variation.|$|R
50|$|A high {{pressure}} grinding roll, {{often referred to}} as HPGRs or roller press, consists out of two rollers with the same dimensions, which are rotating against each other with the same circumferential speed. The special feeding of bulk material through a hopper leads to a material bed between the two rollers. The <b>bearing</b> <b>units</b> of one roller can move linearly and are pressed against the material bed by springs or hydraulic cylinders. The pressures in the material bed are greater than 50 MPa (7,000 PSI). In general they achieve 100 to 300 MPa. By this the material bed is compacted to a solid volume portion of more than 80%.|$|E
