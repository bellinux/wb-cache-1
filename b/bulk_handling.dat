5|$|While {{state of}} the art materials-handling methods were used, in some {{instances}} labour-saving machinery worked beside operations intended to maximise the labour content. Sustenance workers were employed chiefly for on-site preparation, road construction, foundation excavation, clearing timber from the reservoir basin, and on some concreting operations. Skilled workers were required on the dam for fixing the formwork where the concrete was poured. These workers were probably employed at normal day labour rates, the main employment method used on the project. <b>Bulk</b> <b>handling</b> of cement was also used {{for the first time in}} Australia, this saw a significant saving as opposed to bagged cement which was the standard practice of the day.|$|E

40|$|Large-scale {{handling}} of particulate solids can cause severe wear on <b>bulk</b> solids <b>handling</b> equipment surfaces. Wear reduces equipment life span and increases maintenance cost. Examples of traditional methods to reduce wear of <b>bulk</b> solids <b>handling</b> equipment include optimizing transport operations and utilizing resistant materials. To our knowledge, the so-called bionic design {{has not been}} utilized. Bionic design is the application of biological models, systems, or elements to modern engineering.

In order to use bionic design for wear reduction of <b>bulk</b> solids <b>handling</b> equipment surfaces, this paper introduces bionic design to <b>bulk</b> solids <b>handling</b> on the basis of analogies between biology and <b>bulk</b> solids <b>handling.</b> In addition, a bionic design methodology for the wear reduction of <b>bulk</b> solids <b>handling</b> equipment surfaces is formulated.

40|$|<b>Bulk</b> solids <b>handling</b> {{continues}} {{to play an important}} role in a number of industries. One of the issues during <b>bulk</b> solids <b>handling</b> processes is equipment surface wear. Wear results in high economic loss and increases downtime. Current wear reduction methods such as optimizing transfer conditions or using wear-resistant materials, have brought notable progress. Nevertheless, the wear loss is still significant. Therefore, new solutions for reducing the surface wear must be investigated. Because wear also occurs to the surfaces of many biological organisms, inspirations for wear reduction can be obtained from biology. In this research, the bionic design method is explored to reduce the surface wear of <b>bulk</b> solids <b>handling</b> equipment. This thesis firstly illustrates the analytical wear models in <b>bulks</b> solids <b>handling.</b> Hence, the wear phenomena in biology are investigated. Based on the analogies between biology and <b>bulk</b> solids <b>handling,</b> a bionic design method for wear reduction of <b>bulk</b> solids <b>handling</b> equipment surfaces is developed. Furthermore, two bionic models for reducing abrasive and erosive wear respectively, are proposed for the applications of <b>bulk</b> solids <b>handling</b> equipment surfaces. To model the effects of applying bionic models on the surface wear of <b>bulk</b> solids <b>handling</b> equipment, the discrete element method (DEM) is utilized. Using the parameter values obtained from experiments, the wear of bionic surfaces and conventional smooth surfaces is successfully modeled. By comparing predicted wear loss from bionic surfaces and smooth surfaces, the effectiveness of reducing wear by application of bionic models are successfully demonstrated. Moreover, parametric studies on geometrical parameters of bionic models were also carried out. The results demonstrate that as biological wear reduction mechanisms are implemented, wear reduction of <b>bulk</b> solids <b>handling</b> equipment surfaces can be achieved. It is shown that abrasive wear loss can be reduced by up to 63 % whilst erosive wear loss can be reduced by up to 26 %.
