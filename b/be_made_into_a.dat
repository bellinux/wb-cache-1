5|$|In 1965, {{historian}} Joseph Wulf {{proposed that}} the Wannsee House should <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Holocaust memorial and document centre, but the West German government was not interested at that time. The building was in use as a school, and funding was not available. Despondent at {{the failure of the}} project and the West German government's failure to pursue and convict Nazi war criminals, Wulf committed suicide in 1974.|$|E
5|$|The one-act opera genre {{had become}} {{increasingly}} popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno {{for the best}} such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> trilogy of one-act operas.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to his extensive documentary film work, two of Hugh Atkinson’s novels <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> films. His novel The Games, about the Olympics, <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> film of the same name. His novel The Reckoning <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> dramatic film entitled Weekend of Shadows.

5|$|An st-{{planar graph}} is a {{connected}} planar graph {{together with a}} bipolar orientation of that graph, an orientation that makes it acyclic with a single source and a single sink, {{both of which are}} required {{to be on the same}} face as each other. Such a graph may <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> strongly connected graph by adding one more edge, from the sink back to the source, through the outer face. The dual of this augmented planar graph is itself the augmentation of another st-planar graph.|$|E
5|$|Any {{directed}} graph may <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> DAG by removing a feedback vertex set or a feedback arc set, {{a set of}} vertices or edges (respectively) that touches all cycles. However, the smallest such set is NP-hard to find. An arbitrary {{directed graph}} may also {{be transformed into a}} DAG, called its condensation, by contracting each of its strongly connected components into a single supervertex. When the graph is already acyclic, its smallest feedback vertex sets and feedback arc sets are empty, and its condensation is the graph itself.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Greece itself, {{medicinal}} plants are produced in Italy in Tyrrhenia, as Aeschylus records, and Latium; and in Egypt, which as Homer mentions {{is the source}} of the drug nepenthes that makes men forget sorrow and passion. The best hemlock comes from Susa, while dittany, useful in childbirth, comes only from Crete. Wolfsbane comes from Crete and Zakynthos; it can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> poison that causes death a year or more after taking it, and there is no antidote. Hemlock is a poison which brings a painless death; pepper and frankincense are antidotes for it. Strykhnos causes madness, but oleander root in wine makes people gentle and cheerful. Birthwort has many uses including for bruises on the head, snakebite, and prolapse of the uterus.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, conservationists became {{alarmed by the}} damage overgrazing, logging, and {{unregulated}} visitation were having on the fragile features of Bryce Canyon. A movement to have the area protected was soon started, and National Park Service Director Stephen Mather responded by proposing that Bryce Canyon <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> state park. The governor of Utah and the Utah State Legislature, however, lobbied for national protection of the area. Mather relented and sent his recommendation to President Warren G. Harding, who on June 8, 1923 declared Bryce Canyon a national monument.|$|E
5|$|Following {{decommissioning}} in 1997, {{the ship}} was earmarked for preservation as a museum ship in Mumbai. Lack of funding prevented progress on the ship's conversion to a museum and it was speculated that the ship would <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> training ship. In 2001, {{the ship was}} {{opened to the public}} by the Indian Navy, but the Government of Maharashtra was unable to find a partner to operate the museum on a permanent, long-term basis and the museum was closed after it was deemed unsafe for the public in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In April 2013, Sutton met Kevin Spacey's filmmaker-in-residence Grigorij Richters while rehearsing {{as part of}} {{the drummer}} group for the opening {{ceremony}} of the 2013 UEFA Champions League final at Wembley Stadium. They quickly became friends. Richters and his team began following him around for several months, filming Sutton at home with his family and at several fundraisers. In the summer of 2013 Sutton went on holiday to Ibiza (his last travel) with his close friends. Richters equipped him with several GoPro cameras. The documentary is in development, as of 2016, and will <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> feature-length film.|$|E

5|$|In the film, James Bond {{is sent to}} Jamaica to {{investigate}} the disappearance of a fellow British agent. The trail leads him to the underground base of Dr. No, who is plotting to disrupt an early American space launch with a radio beam weapon. Although {{the first of the}} Bond books to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> film, Dr. No was not the first of Fleming's novels, Casino Royale being the debut for the character; the film makes a few references to threads from earlier books. This film also introduced the criminal organisation SPECTRE, which would also appear in six subsequent films.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{dissection}} puzzle {{similar to}} a Tangram, and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the Archimedes Palimpsest. Archimedes calculates {{the areas of the}} 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a square. Research published by Dr. Reviel Netz of Stanford University in 2003 argued that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could be assembled into the shape of a square. Dr. Netz calculates that the pieces can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> square 17,152 ways. The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and reflection have been excluded. The puzzle represents an example of an early problem in combinatorics.|$|E
5|$|Important {{polynomial}} time computational problems on DAGs include topological sorting (finding a topological ordering), {{construction of the}} transitive closure and transitive reduction (the largest and smallest DAGs with the same reachability relation, respectively), and the closure problem, in which {{the goal is to}} find a minimum-weight subset of vertices with no edges connecting them {{to the rest of the}} graph. Transforming a directed graph with cycles into a DAG by deleting as few vertices or edges as possible (the feedback vertex set and feedback edge set problem, respectively) is NP-hard, but any directed graph can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> DAG (its condensation) by contracting each strongly connected component into a single supervertex. The problems of finding shortest paths and longest paths can be solved on DAGs in linear time, in contrast to arbitrary graphs for which shortest path algorithms are slower and longest path problems are NP-hard.|$|E

5|$|Radcliffe has {{supported}} various charities. He designed the Cu-Bed for Habitat's VIP Kids range (a cube made of eight smaller ones which can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bed, chaise-longue or chair) {{with all the}} royalties {{from the sale of}} the bed going directly to his favourite charity, Demelza House Children's Hospice in Sittingbourne, Kent. Radcliffe has urged his fans to make donations, in lieu of Christmas presents to him, to the charity's Candle for Care program. In 2008 he was among several celebrities who donated their old glasses to an exhibit honouring victims of the Holocaust. During the Broadway run of Equus he auctioned off a pair of jeans and other items worn in the show, for New-York-based Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. and presenting at the 2011 Gypsy of the Year competition. He has also donated money to Get Connected UK, a London-based free confidential national helpline for troubled youth.|$|E
5|$|While {{the entire}} script {{was still in}} the draft phase, Maeda revised lines that felt unnatural after asking others for their {{opinions}} on it, including Na-Ga. When writing the script, Maeda made a conscious effort to write Charlotte in the framework of an anime series, as opposed to when he wrote the script for Angel Beats!, which he admits he wrote more akin to the framework of a video game. In this way, Toba felt that Charlotte was Maeda's effort to write a story in its purest form that could not <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> video game, unlike Angel Beats!. Toba also noted that the characters in Charlotte are not written for a video game scenario, especially the protagonist, and went on to echo Horikawa's sentiment that Charlotte is akin to an I novel for Maeda. Toba explained that this is a result of Maeda's effort to remove the restrictions that come from writing the scenario for a video game.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of The Castle of Cagliostro, Miyazaki began working on his ideas for an {{animated}} film adaptation of Richard Corben's comic book Rowlf and pitched the idea to Yutaka Fujioka at TMS. In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights. Around that time, Miyazaki was also approached {{for a series of}} magazine articles by the editorial staff of Animage. During subsequent conversations, he showed his sketchbooks and discussed basic outlines for envisioned animation projects with editors Toshio Suzuki and Osamu Kameyama, who saw the potential for collaboration on their development into animation. Two projects were proposed: , to be set in the Sengoku period; and the adaptation of Corben's Rowlf. Both were rejected, as the company was unwilling to fund anime projects not based on existing manga, and the rights for the adaptation of Rowlf could not be secured. An agreement was reached that Miyazaki could start developing his sketches and ideas into a manga for the magazine with the proviso that it would never <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> film. The manga—titled Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind—ran from February 1982 to March 1994. The story, as re-printed in the tankōbon volumes, spans seven volumes for a combined total of 1060 pages. Miyazaki drew the episodes primarily in pencil, and it was printed monochrome in sepia toned ink. Miyazaki resigned from Telecom Animation Film in November 1982.|$|E

5|$|A second noted {{house in}} the Dupont Circle {{neighborhood}} which is claimed to be haunted is the Woodrow Wilson House (2340 S Street NW). Woodrow Wilson was elected President of the United States in 1912, was re-elected in 1916 promising to keep the nation out of war, led the nation through World War I, and left office in 1921. At 2 AM on September 26, 1919, while traveling to Wichita, Kansas, on a nationwide speaking tour to win public support to pressure the Senate into ratifying the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson collapsed and, after cancelling {{the rest of his}} speaking tour, was rushed back to the capital by train. His condition worsened on the journey, and upon arriving at the White House on October 2 the President suffered a life-threatening stroke that left him permanently paralyzed on his left side and blind in the left eye. Although the President lived, he was confined to bed for two months, seen only by his wife, a few close associates, and his physicians. From December 1919 to April 1920 Wilson required a wheelchair. Wilson attended his first Cabinet meeting in April 1920, {{but for the rest of}} the year his mind continued to wander, his memory was marred, and he tired easily. By March 1921 (when he left office) Wilson was able to walk short distances with the use of a cane (and with a valet close at hand). The extent of Wilson's disability was kept from the public until after his death on February 3, 1924. President and Mrs. Wilson purchased a large home at 2340 S Street NW, to which a number of modifications were made (including the addition of an elevator). Woodrow Wilson received few guests in his last years, and died in his third floor bedroom on February 3, 1924. His wife, Edith Bolling Galt Wilson, lived in the home until her death on December 28, 1961, and willed the home to the National Trust for Historic Preservation to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> museum honoring her husband. In the decades since her death, staff and visitors at the Woodrow Wilson House claim to have seen the President's ghost sitting in his rocking chair, heard the shuffle of a man walking with a cane, and heard a man sob.|$|E
