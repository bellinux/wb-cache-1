5|$|In October 2015, Deadline.com {{reported}} that Rebecca Ferguson is in negotiations for a role. In November 2015, Scott {{announced that the}} film was retitled Alien: Covenant. In December 2015, Deadline reports that actress Katherine Waterston was cast in the lead role of Daniels. Alien: Covenant will take place {{ten years after the}} events of Prometheus. Scott has stated that the sequel will be a hard R rating. In February 2016, Danny McBride entered negotiations to join the film as a crew member of the Covenant ship, along with Demian <b>Bichir,</b> Jussie Smollett, Amy Seimetz, Carmen Ejogo, Callie Hernandez, Alex England and Billy Crudup joining the cast.|$|E
5|$|Sergeant Lope (Demián <b>Bichir)</b> is {{the ranking}} {{military}} officer aboard the Covenant {{who is married}} to Sergeant Hallett. Lope leads the excursion on the planet's surface to the crashed Engineer ship. On the journey back to the lander, Lope notices Hallett's condition deteriorating, which alarms him. Upon reaching the lander, the ship explodes and a Neomorph attacks while another bursts from his husband's throat. A Neomorph attacks Lope when David intervenes and leads the survivors to his base, where Lope discovers Shaw's corpse. He is attacked by a Facehugger, but he is quickly and seemingly saved by Cole, who manages to cut it off him, though his face is severely burned by acid in the process. As Cole is killed by a now mature Alien, Lope escapes with the other survivors to the cargo lander. Aboard Covenant, Lope receives medical treatment, but dies when an Alien erupts from his chest, revealing that despite the short time that the Facehugger was on him, it succeeded in impregnating him.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} teleost is denser than water, so fish must {{compensate}} for the difference or they will sink. Many teleosts have a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases {{to allow them to}} stay at the current water depth, or ascend or descend without having to waste energy in swimming. In the more primitive groups like some minnows, the swim bladder is open to the esophagus and doubles as a lung. It is often absent in fast-swimming fishes such as the tuna and mackerel. In fish where the swim bladder is closed, the gas content is controlled through the rete mirabilis, a network of blood vessels serving as a countercurrent gas exchanger between the swim bladder and the blood. The Chondrostei such as sturgeons also have a swim bladder, but this appears to have evolved separately: other Actinopterygii such as the bowfin and the <b>bichir</b> do not have one, so swim bladders appear to have arisen twice, and the teleost swim bladder is not homologous with the chondrostean one.|$|E

25|$|Cuvier is commemorated in {{the naming}} of several animals; they include Cuvier's beaked whale (which he first thought to be extinct), Cuvier's gazelle, Cuvier's toucan, Cuvier's <b>bichir,</b> Cuvier's dwarf caiman, Galeocerdo cuvier (tiger shark), and Anolis cuvieri, a lizard from Puerto Rico. There also are some extinct animals named after Cuvier, such as the South American giant sloth Catonyx cuvieri.|$|E
25|$|If so, their {{locations}} could {{imply that}} the Carpi had very gradually migrated westwards in the period 400 BC - AD 140, a view championed by Kahrstedt. These names' common element carp- appears frequently in Dacian and Thracian placenames and personal names. But {{there is no consensus}} that these groups are in fact Carpi. <b>Bichir</b> suggests that they were Thraco-Dacian tribes distantly related to the Carpi.|$|E
25|$|Six cemeteries in Bichir's list contain both {{cremation}} and inhumation graves. At the Poieneşti site (the {{only one}} fully investigated by 1976), 6 adults and 17 children were buried (compared with 62 cremated). Of these, 2 adults and 7 children {{were found to}} have artificially elongated crania. This custom, achieved by tightly binding an infant's skull during its early growth phase, is associated with steppe nomads. <b>Bichir</b> identifies the adults as nomads and the children as the progeny of mixed nomad-sedentary marriages.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} {{character is}} Nancy Price Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker), a housewife from southern California {{who becomes a}} pot dealer after her husband Judah (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) dies. Although her drug-dealing career achieves mixed success, she eventually rises to {{the highest levels of}} an international drug-smuggling cartel. Nancy remarries three times during the series. First, she has an under-the-radar wedding with Peter Scottson (Martin Donovan), a DEA agent, who was later killed. In season five, she marries Esteban Reyes (Demián <b>Bichir),</b> the fictional mayor of Tijuana and leader of a cartel, who is murdered by the seventh season. While in prison, Nancy also establishes a long-term relationship with Zoya, a woman convicted of murdering her own boyfriend. In the series finale, which leaps forward seven years, viewers come to know that Nancy married Rabbi David Bloom, who later died in a car accident.|$|E
500|$|The bowfin genome {{contains}} an intact ParaHox gene cluster, {{similar to the}} <b>bichir</b> and to most other vertebrates. [...] This is in contrast, however, with teleost fishes, which have a fragmented ParaHox cluster, probably because of a whole genome duplication event in their lineage. The presence of an intact ParaHox gene cluster suggests that bowfin ancestors separated from other fishes before the last common ancestor of all teleosts appeared. Bowfin are thus possibly a better model to study vertebrate genome organization than common teleost model organisms such as zebrafish.|$|E
500|$|On 3 March 2009, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, {{himself an}} avowed Marxist and admirer of Che Guevara, greeted Del Toro and co star <b>Bichir</b> at the Presidential Palace in Caracas. The day prior Del Toro {{attended}} {{a screening of}} the film at a bullfighting ring-turned cultural center, where he was [...] "mobbed by adoring fans". Del Toro then visited the state-run Cinema Town, a film production facility President Chávez launched to help Venezuela produce its own movies {{as an alternative to}} what Chávez calls Hollywood's cultural imperialism. Del Toro described Che as [...] "a totally Latin American movie" [...] and stated that he had [...] "a good meeting with the President".|$|E

50|$|P. ornatipinnis has {{black and}} yellow {{patterning}} on its body, head, and fins, with 9 to 11 dorsal spines. It {{is the largest}} of the Polypterus species, with a protruding upper jaw, reaching 24 in in length. This fish can range in colour from dark brown to brownish grey, and is very common in the aquarium trade, like many other <b>bichirs.</b> This fish has a primitive pair of lungs, enabling it to survive out of water for a short time. It has eyes on the sides on its head and two pectoral fins, {{and is one of the}} more attractive of the <b>bichirs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... ==Air breathing== <b>Bichirs</b> possess paired lungs which {{connect to}} the {{esophagus}} via a glottis. They are obligate air-breathers, requiring access to surface air to breathe in poorly oxygenated water. Their lungs are highly vascularized to facilitate gas exchange. Deoxygenated arterial blood is brought to the lungs by paired pulmonary arteries, which branch from the fourth efferent branchial arteries (artery from the fourth gill arch), and oxygenated blood leaves the lungs in pulmonary veins. Unlike most lungfish and tetrapods, their lungs are smooth sacs instead of alveolated tissue. <b>Bichirs</b> are unique in that they breathe using a recoil aspiration.|$|R
500|$|The lungs of today's {{terrestrial}} vertebrates {{and the gas}} bladders of today's {{fish are}} believed to have evolved from simple sacs, as outpocketings of the esophagus, that allowed early fish to gulp air under oxygen-poor conditions. These outpocketings first arose in the [...] bony fish. In most of the ray-finned fish the sacs evolved into closed off gas bladders, while a number of carp, trout, herring, catfish, and eels have retained the physostome condition with the sack being open to the esophagus. In more basal bony fish, such as the gar, <b>bichir,</b> bowfin and the lobe-finned fish, the bladders have evolved to primarily function as lungs. The lobe-finned fish gave rise to the land-based tetrapods. Thus, the lungs of vertebrates are homologous to the gas bladders of fish (but not to their gills).|$|E
500|$|In 2015, {{she played}} Graciela Arias {{in the film}} Los Crímenes del Mar del Norte, based on {{the true story of}} Goyo Cárdenas, the {{strangler}} of Tacuba. The following year, Espinosa played Mexican singer Lola Beltrán on Hasta Que Te Conocí, based on the life of Mexican artist Juan Gabriel, for which she had to perform the track [...] "Cucurrucucú Paloma", Beltrán's signature song. Espinosa co-produced, co-wrote, and starred in Los Bañistas, a film that had a limited release in Mexico (10 copies) in 2016. In the film, directed by Max Zunino, she plays Flavia, a young protester who gets involved with an older man, Juan Carlos Colombo. Espinosa's performance was met with positive reviews, such as the one written by Luis Fernando Galván of En Filme, stating that the actress [...] "effectively embodies the hope for social renewal from a convincing performance where she goes on a trip into a social space with the intention of finding her place in the world and helping others to do the same". Espinosa and Zunino re-teamed for Bruma, in which the actress plays Martina, and according to John Hopewell of Variety, [...] "follows a young woman (Espinosa) from Mexico's stifling upper middle-classes who, pregnant, escapes to Berlin and finds a kind of father figure and freedom in a Berlin club drag queen chanteuse and a final sense of her individual identity". The film was written by Espinosa and Zunino and won five awards at the 10th Works in Progress Guadalajara Festival. In 2016, it was announced by Variety magazine that Espinosa would join Mexican actors Demián <b>Bichir</b> and Diego Luna in the film The Black Minutes; in the same year, Espinosa played Rocío in the TV series Las Trece Esposas, produced by Blim and inspired by One Thousand and One Nights. Espinosa also had a voice role in the American animated film Kubo and the Two Strings (2016) and a role in La Gran Promesa, directed by Jorge Ramirez Suárez.|$|E
2500|$|There is no dispute among {{scholars}} {{that some}} Decebalic-era Dacian settlements in Moldavia (mostly {{west of the}} Siret, with a few on the east bank (including Piroboridava, identified with Poiana-Tecuci), were abandoned by 106, most likely, according to <b>Bichir,</b> {{as a result of}} the Roman conquest of Dacia. From this time, <b>Bichir</b> identifies two distinct cultures in Moldavia, existing side-by-side.

5000|$|<b>Bichirs</b> are {{elongated}} {{fish with}} a unique series of dorsal finlets which vary in number from seven to 18, instead of a single dorsal fin.

The body is covered in thick, bonelike, and rhombic (ganoid) scales. Their jaw structure more closely resembles that of the tetrapods than that of the teleost fishes. <b>Bichirs</b> have a number of other primitive characteristics, including fleshy pectoral fins superficially similar to those of lobe-finned fishes.
