After {{borrowing}} £50, Harry released {{the first issue of}} Mersey <b>Beat</b> <b>on</b> 6 July 1961, with the first 5,000 copies selling out within a short time. The newspaper was published every two weeks, covering the music scenes in Liverpool, Wirral, Birkenhead, New Brighton, Crosby and Southport, as well as Warrington, Widnes and Runcorn. He edited the paper in a small attic office above a wine merchant's shop at 81a Renshaw Street, Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|On January 14, 2011, Morgan was {{the first}} overall pick in the 2011 WPS Draft by the Western New York Flash. She {{was the first}} California Golden Bears women's soccer player to be drafted {{in the first round}} of Women's Professional Soccer (WPS). Morgan scored her first goal for the Flash during the team's home opener—a 3–0 win over the Atlanta <b>Beat</b> <b>on</b> May 1, 2011. Throughout the 2011 season, she played in 14 matches and scored four goals. The club won the regular season title and the WPS Championship title the same year.|$|E
5|$|Then {{the girl}} was pulled into the tent and the men started to <b>beat</b> <b>on</b> the shields so her screams could not be heard. Six men entered the tent to have {{intercourse}} with the girl, after which they forced her onto her master's bed. Two men grabbed her hands, and two men her wrists. The angel of death put a rope {{around her neck and}} while two men pulled the rope, the old woman stabbed the girl between her ribs with a knife. Thereafter, the relatives of the dead chieftain arrived with a burning torch and set the ship aflame. It is said that the fire facilitates the voyage to the realm of the dead.|$|E

5|$|Winters was {{selected}} {{in the first round}} of the 2011 WPS Draft by the Boston Breakers. She scored her first goal in the 22nd minute of her professional debut during the Breakers' 4–1 win over the Atlanta <b>Beat</b> <b>on</b> April 9, 2011. During the 2011 WPS regular season, she recorded three goals and two assists while starting in 18 of the 19 games in which she played. Winters helped the Breakers to the playoffs where she scored the team's lone goal during the 3-1 loss to magicJack. Her season performance earned her a nomination for the WPS Rookie of the Year Award. The WPS suspended operations in early 2012.|$|E

25|$|Race {{fourteen}} {{was another}} {{end to end}} win by Oracle. Starting in the leeward position, Spithill again luffed Barker hard substantially past the reach mark.

They could not press the advantage however, and Oracle led well around the top mark. Team New Zealand once again closed right up to the American boat about halfway down the fourth leg, but could not make the pass. Oracle closed out the win by 23 seconds to bring the score to 4–8.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the event}} went live on pay-per-view, Raw's Ric Flair and Carlito faced SmackDown!'s Gregory Helms and Chavo Guerrero in a tag team {{lumberjack}} match. Flair and Carlito controlled {{the early part}} of the match until Helms threw Flair over the top rope. SmackDown! lumberjacks attacked Flair before throwing him back into the ring. Helms and Guerrero continued to <b>beat</b> <b>on</b> Flair, but couldn't pin Flair. Chavo tried to end it with his frog splash, but Flair moved. Chavo tagged in Helms, but Flair tagged in Carlito. Carlito dominated Helms, leading to Guerrero coming in to help Helms, but Flair came in and fought Guerrero. Flair and Guerrero took each other out of the ring, and before the lumberjacks could throw them back in the ring, Carlito hit the Backstabber on Guerrero to pick up the win for himself and Flair.|$|E

25|$|In {{selecting}} {{their team}} for Australia the MCC selectors (Sir Pelham Warner, Harry Altham, Gubby Allen, Les Ames, William Findlay, Tom Pearce, Walter Robins, Brian Sellers and Bob Wyatt) {{made the mistake}} on relying on experience {{on one hand and}} youth on the other, but with little between. In this they were not helped by the hole left in English cricket by the Second World War, but only three players (Godfrey Evans, Trevor Bailey and Reg Simpson) were aged between 26 and 31 and could be said to be at their prime; nine of the players were 32 or more and six 26 or less. The captain Freddie Brown had last toured Australia in 1932-33 with Douglas Jardine and Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook, Denis Compton, Doug Wright, Alec Bedser and Godfrey Evans in 1946-47 under Wally Hammond; {{the rest of the team}} had never travelled down under. Bill Edrich who had made a gutsy 462 runs (46.20) in 1946-47 and would tour Australia again in 1954-55, but was out of favour at Lord's (he was being divorced, and such things counted in the 1950s) and had had an injury-struck season. The two biggest wicket-takers of 1950 were the top spinners Jim Laker and Johnny Wardle. Laker had taken an astounding 8/2 in the 1950 Bradford Test Trial, but his brand of off-spin was deemed too slow for the hard Australian pitches and he was not chosen for the 1954-55 tour either. In the 1956 Ashes series he took 46 wickets (9.60) including 19/90 at Old Trafford and when he finally toured Australia in 1958-59 he took 15 wickets (21.20). The Yorkshireman Johnny Wardle was also left behind, but would finish with 102 Test wickets (20.39) with his combination of Slow Left Arm bowling and Chinamen. To be fair to the selectors Laker had only taken 32 Test wickets (37.34) at the time and Wardle just 2 (56.50). The MCC were committed to a youth policy that consistently failed them. In 1950 they relied overly on young undergraduates from Cambridge University and had lost 3-1 to the West Indies as a result. A continuation of this policy was unlikely to succeed in Australia, but John Dewes, David Sheppard and John Warr were chosen for the tour along with the young professionals Brian Close, Gilbert Parkhouse and Bob Berry. They all failed when faced with real class and only served to increase the burden on the senior players. Remembering his torrid time in 1946-47 Cyril Washbrook declined to tour when selected, but was later flown out with Roy Tattersall and Brian Statham. Washbrook's fears were full realised, Tattersall failed and Statham would not make his Test debut until the party reached New Zealand. Freddie Brown was the selector's third choice to lead the tour, after Norman Yardley of Yorkshire and George Mann of Middlesex both declined the job and he was only chosen as Lord's was determined to have an amateur captain. It was a thankless job as even with the retirement of the great Don Bradman it was clear that Australia were the stronger team and would be hard to <b>beat</b> <b>on</b> their own ground. They had defeated Wally Hammond 3-0 in 1946-47 and Yardley 4-0 in 1948 and England had not won a Test against them in twelve years.|$|E

500|$|Rhythm {{is perhaps}} the most {{important}} component of [...] "Old Dan Tucker". It begins with a cadenced introduction and little melody. Even when the tune begins in earnest, it is flat and non-harmonized and does little more than provide a <b>beat</b> <b>on</b> which words are uttered. The refrain is syncopated in a way that had only previously been used in the minstrel song [...] "Old Zip Coon". The intense rhythm on the line [...] "Get out the way!" [...] generates a forward momentum and is answered by instruments in one example of the song's black-influenced call and response.|$|E
500|$|Brian has {{credited}} {{his brother}} and bandmate Carl for suggesting the cello as an instrument to use. He also stated that its triplet <b>beat</b> <b>on</b> the chorus was his own idea, {{and that it was}} based on the Crystals' [...] "Da Doo Ron Ron" [...] (1963), produced by Spector. Alternatively, multi-instrumentalist songwriter Van Dyke Parks says that he suggested having the celloist play triplets for Brian. Parks believes that having Brian exploit the cello [...] "to such a hyperbolic degree" [...] was what encouraged the duo to immediately collaborate on the ultimately unfinished album Smile. At some point, Brian asked Parks to pen lyrics for the song, although Parks declined.|$|E

Jonathan Van Meter from Spin was critical of the song, saying that [...] "State of the World", [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] and [...] "The Knowledge" [...] formed [...] "a Spike Lee-esque trilogy made even less convincing by a tiresome house music back-beat and that unfortunate, outdated <b>beat</b> <b>on</b> every fourth count".
