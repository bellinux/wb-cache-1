5|$|In November, the Board {{agreed to}} a {{compromise}} design that incorporated a secondary battery of eight 8in guns in four twin turrets amidships and twelve 7in guns in casemates. The decision to retain the 8in guns was made in large part due to American experiences in the Spanish–American War three years before. US Navy officers had been impressed {{with the performance of}} the gun at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba; despite scoring only 13 hits out of 309 shells fired, the gun had a flat trajectory and good range for its size. Armor protection was improved over the BuOrd design, with a thicker armored <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> casemate protection, albeit at the expense of thinner armor covering the barbettes that supported the gun turrets. The designers reasoned that since the barbettes were behind the <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> a transverse bulkhead, weight could be saved by reducing the level of direct protection.|$|E

40|$|Results of the swov-accident {{investigation}} {{prove that}} {{if there are any}} differences in the effectiveness of lap <b>belts</b> <b>and</b> three-point <b>belts,</b> these are so small that they cannot form a basis for giving preference to one type over the other. Furthermore, in spite of the results of this investigation which show some disadvantageous effects of diagonal belts (as compared to lap <b>belts</b> <b>and</b> three-point <b>belts),</b> involving a higher injury risk, which leads to the conclusion that general use of this type should not be favoured, a complete comdemnation of diagonal belts seems exaggerated. The effectiveness percentages of both lap <b>belts</b> <b>and</b> three-point <b>belts</b> show independently very high values. It is justifiable to draw the conclusion that both lap <b>belts</b> <b>and</b> three-point <b>belts</b> are highly effective measures for safety in traffic.

Likewise, dwarf planets in the asteroid <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> Kuiper belt should be considered planets according to Stern.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers use three {{different}} systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn. SystemI has {{a period of}} 10hr 14min 00sec (844.3°/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone, the South Equatorial <b>Belt</b> <b>and</b> the North Equatorial Belt. The polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to SystemI. All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding {{the north and south}} polar regions, are indicated as SystemII and have been assigned a rotation period of 10hr 38min 25.4sec (810.76°/d). SystemIII refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on radio emissions from the planet in the period of the Voyager flybys, it has been assigned a rotation period of 10hr 39min 22.4sec (810.8°/d). Because it is close to SystemII, it has largely superseded it.|$|E

Crossing from Davidson County into neighboring Guilford County {{and the city of}} High Point, NC 68 is cosigned with English Road. Approximately one mile within the city limits, NC68 turns left onto Westchester Drive, a boulevard that bypasses High Point's downtown area. Arriving at the Main Street interchange, the city's busiest, NC68 continues onto Eastchester Drive, another boulevard.

5|$|Between the 2:3 and 1:2 {{resonances}} with Neptune, {{at approximately}} 42–48AU, the gravitational interactions with Neptune occur {{over an extended}} timescale, and objects can exist with their orbits essentially unaltered. This region {{is known as the}} classical Kuiper <b>belt,</b> <b>and</b> its members comprise roughly two thirds of KBOs observed to date. Because the first modern KBO discovered, , is considered the prototype of this group, classical KBOs are often referred to as cubewanos ("Q-B-1-os"). The guidelines established by the IAU demand that classical KBOs be given names of mythological beings associated with creation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1916, {{the four}} {{remaining}} ships were withdrawn from service with the fleet. They were placed into reserve on 15 August 1917.

5|$|Eris {{was never}} officially {{classified}} as a planet, and the 2006 definition of planet defined both Eris and Pluto not as planets but as dwarf planets {{because they have not}} cleared their neighbourhoods.

Pluto itself is now recognized as {{being a member of the}} Kuiper <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> the largest dwarf planet, larger than the more-massive Eris.|$|E
