Her life continued unchanged, filled with social events. In September 1926, Dorothy {{gave birth to a}} son, Omar Pound, who in 1927 was brought from France to be raised in England.

5|$|After {{struggling}} {{in the latter}} half of the 1960s and the entire 1970s, the Giants hired an outsider, George Young, to run football operations for the first time in several decades. The Giants on-field product and business aspects improved rapidly following the hiring. In 1990, Jack Mara's son, Tim, who was struggling with cancer at the time, sold his half of the team to Bob Tisch. This marked the first time in franchise history the team had not been solely owned by the Mara family. In 2005, Wellington Mara, who had <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> team since its inception in 1925 when he worked as a ball boy, died.

5|$|Already {{considered}} washed up, the Giants {{intended to}} have Tittle share quarterback duties with 40-year-old Charlie Conerly, who had <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> team since 1948. The players at first remained loyal to Conerly, and treated Tittle {{with the cold}} shoulder. Tittle missed the season opener due to a back injury sustained before the season. His first game with New York came in week two, against the Steelers, in which he and Conerly each threw a touchdown pass in the Giants' 17–14 win. He became the team's primary starter {{for the remainder of}} the season and led the revitalized Giants to first place in the Eastern Conference. The Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) awarded Tittle its Jim Thorpe Trophy as the NFL's players' choice of MVP. In the 1961 NFL Championship Game, the Giants were soundly defeated by Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers, as they were shut-out 0–37. Tittle completed six of twenty passes in the game and threw four interceptions.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 2007, Schmid had rebuilt the roster, keeping only three players he had {{inherited}} and acquiring Argentine attacker Guillermo Barros Schelotto. Schmid cut the Crew's goalkeeper, Jon Busch, who had <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> team for five years. Schmid had concerns over Busch's playing style and fitness. Busch later criticized Schmid's management skills, {{and said he would}} never work for the coach again, but gave credit to Schmid's tactical approach. Scheletto's contributions were crucial to Columbus's improvement that season, but the team failed to make the playoffs. A writer for ESPN speculated that the Crew suffered because the team management would not spend more money, while Schmid lamented that he could not attract a foreign star to the little-known city of Columbus.|$|E
5|$|During {{a severe}} local {{recession}} in 1985 the 36-year-old hotel, still {{the second largest}} in Houston but by then in need of extensive refurbishing and refitting, was in effect donated to the Texas Medical Center. In March 1986 a protest rally was held by historic preservationists including McCarthy and the hotel opened its last annual St Patrick's Day party to the public. That evening, some {{people who had been}} at the opening night party in 1949 reportedly attended a semi-formal event in the hotel's Emerald room. A few employees had <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hotel since its first year of operation. The building was demolished 1 June 1987 (McCarthy died 18 months later) and the land was paved over as a surface parking lot. The Institute of Biosciences and Technology, a component of the Texas A Health Science Center has since been built on the site and ironically, along with fountains and some landscaping on the northeast grounds, the hotel's multi-story parking garage was retained.|$|E

5|$|Five single {{sheets of}} bark paper were found {{associated}} with the codex, they had no stucco coating and were brown and water stained. Two of these had adhered to the codex {{and the other three}} may have once <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> codex but had separated. One of these sheets had a painted line in the same red hematite pigment used in the codex itself. A smaller sheet of bark paper was attached to the lined sheet and this smaller piece was submitted for radiocarbon dating. This testing produced a date for the sheet of AD 1230 ± 130; this would date the document {{to the end of the}} Early Postclassic period (c. 950–1200) and would make the codex the oldest known surviving Mesoamerican codex. The lack of incrustations or insect damage to the codex suggests that, if genuine, it was stored inside a container for hundreds of years. The overall damaged state of the codex conflicts with the good preservation of surviving parts; it may be that the damaged codex was deliberately decommissioned as a ritual object, rather than being simply discarded.|$|E

The romantic comedy Dostana (2008) was the first mainstream Hindi film to take a homosexual storyline. In 2012, Karan Johar directed the college romance Student of the Year, which marked the debut of actors Sidharth Malhotra, Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt. The following year, the company co-produced the critically acclaimed drama The Lunchbox, which was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. Dharma Productions' greatest successes in the 2010s came with the social drama My Name Is Khan (2010), the 2012 remake of Agneepath, the romantic comedy-drama Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013), the romantic drama 2 States (2014), the family drama Kapoor & Sons (2016), the romance Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (2016), and the romantic comedy Badrinath Ki Dulhania (2017).

5|$|Gerard (died 21 May 1108) was Archbishop of York between 1100 and 1108 and Lord Chancellor of England from 1085 until 1092.

5|$|Huw Edwards is a Welsh {{conductor}} {{currently serving}} as {{music director of}} Olympia, Washington's Olympia Symphony Orchestra and orchestra conductor at the University of Puget Sound. Edwards' conducting career began at age seventeen when he became {{music director of the}} Maidstone Opera Company in England. He later attended the University of Surrey, where he conducted the college orchestra along with an ensemble that he formed himself. At age twenty-three, he won a conducting competition which sent him to Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. He then held a lecturer position at Northwestern University in Chicago, where he was also a doctoral candidate. Edwards was conductor and music director of the Portland Youth Philharmonic from 1995 to 2002 followed by the Seattle Youth Symphony from 2002 to 2005. He served as music director of the Portland Columbia Symphony Orchestra from 2000 to 2012 and has <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Olympia Symphony Orchestra since 2002. In May 2012 Edwards accepted a position as orchestra conductor at the University of Puget Sound.|$|E
5|$|In 17th-century Spain, {{painters}} rarely enjoyed high social status. Painting {{was regarded}} as a craft, not an art such as poetry or music. Nonetheless, Velázquez worked his way up through the ranks of the court of PhilipIV, and in February 1651 was appointed palace chamberlain (aposentador mayor del palacio). The post brought him status and material reward, but its duties made heavy demands on his time. During the remaining eight years of his life, he painted only a few works, mostly portraits of the royal family. When he painted Las Meninas, he had <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> royal household for 33 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 Walter Loving sought, and was granted, {{a medical}} {{disability}} due to worsening tuberculosis. He was replaced {{as director of}} the band by Pedro B. Navarro.

He was succeeded by José Silos in 1918. During this period the quality of the band suffered and, in 1920, Loving returned to the Philippines to rebuild the group. As part of his long-term plan to ensure the future stability of the band, he hand-picked bandsman Alfonso Fresnido to succeed him. Fresnido was sent to Ohio to study conducting at the Dana Music Institute (now the Dana School of Music at Youngstown State University) before returning to take over the band from Loving, who retired a second time in 1923.|$|E
