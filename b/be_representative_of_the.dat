5|$|Brown {{published}} a formal description and {{name for the}} species in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. He did not designate a type specimen (a specimen to <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species) for the species, but the one specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species. He also did not state the etymology of the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives from the Ancient Greek sphaera- ("round"), and carpos ("fruit"), {{in reference to the}} shape of its infructescences.|$|E
5|$|Early on July8, another brief {{burst in}} {{convection}} {{near the center}} of Blanca occurred. In this area, satellites found sustained winds around 40mph (65km/h). However, the convection quickly dissipated and the winds were not considered to <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm's true intensity. By later that day, convection had not reformed around the center of circulation and Blanca degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure system, corresponding with the final public advisory from the NHC. Although no longer a tropical cyclone, the remnants of Blanca maintained a well-defined low pressure center as it continued its northwesterly movement. Early on July11, the system turned northward and gradually weakened. The following day, the remnants of Blanca dissipated over open waters.|$|E

5|$|The Home Army was {{intended}} to <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish nation, its members being recruited from all parties and social classes (the only notable exception being communists sent by the Soviets, and the Soviet-created People's Army). The Home Army's growth was largely based on integrating, into its ranks, scores of smaller resistance organizations. Most other Polish underground armed organizations were incorporated into the Home Army (though they retained varying degrees of autonomy). The largest organization merged into the Home Army was the leftist Bataliony Chłopskie (Peasants' Battalions), about 1943-44. Parts of the Narodowe Siły Zbrojne (National Armed Forces) also came to be subordinated to the Home Army. As a result, individual Home Army units varied substantially in their political outlooks (notably in their attitudes toward ethnic minorities and toward the Soviets). The largest group that completely refused to join the Home Army was the pro-Soviet, communist People's Army, which at its height in 1944 numbered 30,000 people.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{collected}} from the Moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on Earth, as measured by radiometric dating techniques. They {{range in age from}} about 3.2 billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria, to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust. As such, they represent samples from a very early period {{in the development of the}} Solar System, that are largely absent on Earth. One important rock found during the Apollo Program is dubbed the Genesis Rock, retrieved by astronauts David Scott and James Irwin during the Apollo 15 mission. This anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich feldspar mineral anorthite, and is believed to <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highland crust. A geochemical component called KREEP was discovered by Apollo 12, which has no known terrestrial counterpart. KREEP and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the Moon was once completely molten (see lunar magma ocean).|$|E

However, a single replica was built that is believed to <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AA. This replica is now in the Toyota Automobile Museum.|$|E

25|$|Research {{conducted}} by the country's Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica (INMEGEN) has found that Mexico's Mestizo population is not uniform in its genetic composition, with there being significant regional variation. For example, mestizos of primarily European ancestry predominate in Sonora, while mestizos from the central region (Guanajuato and Zacatecas) have a more even split between indigenous and European. The highest African contribution in the twelve participating states (picked to <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major regions of Mexico) was found in Guerrero and Veracruz, while the highest Asian contribution was found in Guerrero and Sonora.|$|E
25|$|Case-control {{studies are}} usually {{faster and more}} cost {{effective}} than cohort studies, but are sensitive to bias (such as recall bias and selection bias). The main challenge is to identify the appropriate control group; the distribution of exposure among the control group should <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution in the population {{that gave rise to}} the cases. This can be achieved by drawing a random sample from the original population at risk. This has as a consequence that the control group can contain people with the disease under study when the disease has a high attack rate in a population.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} Egyptian pyramids {{is thought to}} {{represent}} the primordial mound from which the Egyptians believed the earth was created. The shape of a pyramid is thought to <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> descending rays of the sun, and most pyramids were faced with polished, highly reflective white limestone, {{in order to give}} them a brilliant appearance when viewed from a distance. Pyramids were often also named in ways that referred to solar luminescence. For example, the formal name of the Bent Pyramid at Dahshur was The Southern Shining Pyramid, and that of Senwosret at el-Lahun was Senwosret is Shining.|$|E

25|$|While economists widely {{cite the}} Big Mac index as a {{reasonable}} real-world measurement of purchasing power parity, the burger methodology has some limitations. In many countries, eating at international fast-food chain restaurants such as McDonald's is relatively expensive {{in comparison to}} eating at a local restaurant, {{and the demand for}} Big Macs is not as large in countries such as India as in the United States. Social status of eating at fast food restaurants such as McDonald's in a local market, what proportion of sales might be to expatriates, local taxes, levels of competition, and import duties on selected items may not <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's economy as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Economic input–output LCA (EIOLCA) {{involves}} use of aggregate sector-level data on {{how much}} environmental impact {{can be attributed to}} each sector of the economy and how much each sector purchases from other sectors. Such analysis can account for long chains (for example, building an automobile requires energy, but producing energy requires vehicles, and building those vehicles requires energy, etc.), which somewhat alleviates the scoping problem of process LCA; however, EIOLCA relies on sector-level averages {{that may or may not}} <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific subset of the sector relevant to a particular product and therefore is not suitable for evaluating the environmental impacts of products. Additionally the translation of economic quantities into environmental impacts is not validated.|$|E
25|$|Reference ranges {{aid in the}} {{evaluation}} of whether a test result's deviation from the mean is a result of random variability or a result of an underlying disease or condition. If the reference group used to establish the reference range can be assumed to <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual person in a healthy state, then a test result from that individual {{that turns out to be}} lower or higher than the reference range can be interpreted as that there is less than 2.5% probability that this would have occurred by random variability in the absence of disease or other condition, which, in turn, is strongly indicative for considering an underlying disease or condition as a cause.|$|E
