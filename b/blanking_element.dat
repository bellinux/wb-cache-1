40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{deformation}} {{of the press}} and the forming tools during a deep drawing process is small. However, it has a significant influence on the formed product, since the draw-in is affected significantly by this deformation. This effect is demonstrated for the cross-die forming process. The process was simulated using the commercial code ABAQUS, comparing different models for the forming tools and blank. The simulated process behaves quite differently when rigid or deformable tools are applied. In the latter case, so-called tool-spacers absorb {{a significant part of the}} blankholder load, resulting in a stronger draw-in of the blank. In all cases, the results depended heavily on the <b>blank</b> <b>element</b> type and on numerical settings for the contact algorithm. These should be treated with great care when accurate results are required...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLarge-sized Solutrean {{laurel leaf}} {{typology}} {{has been defined}} {{on the basis of}} the exceptional pieces found at Volgu, France, in 1874. The geographical distribution of this rare type of large bifacial piece is limited to the border of the French Massif Central. Located at the northern limit of this distribution area, the Maıˆ treaux site provides new data on the reduction schemes of these pieces. Refitted sequences indicate that the Solutrean presence was motivated by the exploitation of local flint resources to produce reserves of lithic tools and/or <b>blanks,</b> <b>elements</b> for composite projectiles and preforms for exportation and later finishing and use/retouch elsewhere. Results of technoeconomic and spatial analyses are compared with those of an experimental project, mostly centred on laurel leaf techno-economy. This integrated experimental approach strongly contributes to the on-going social interpretation of the Maıˆ treaux group, allowing us better to characterize and quantify the remains of laurel leaf reduction processes. Also produced were in situ ‘undisturbed' knapping features for taphonomic reference and interpretation. At the site scale, experimental work coupled with spatial and techno-economic analysis is relevant for the interpretation of different geoarchaeological, technical and social aspects of the archaeological record. At a regional scale, experimental work on the available raw materials in each geographic zone is required to clarify issues related to raw-material procurement, exploitation and circulation, such as regional lithic resource exploitation strategies and inter-site discontinuities of production...|$|R
5000|$|Point <b>Blank</b> {{combines}} <b>elements</b> of {{film noir}} with stylistic touches of the European nouvelle vague. The film features a fractured time-line, disconcerting narrative rhythms (long, slow passages contrasted with sudden outbursts of violence) and a carefully calculated use of film space (stylized compositions of concrete riverbeds, sweeping bridges, empty prison cells). Boorman credits Marvin with {{coming up with}} a lot of the visual metaphors in the film. Boorman said that as the film progressed, scenes would be filmed monochromatically around one particular color (the chilly blues and grays of Acker's apartment, Dickinson's butter yellow bathrobe, the startling red wall in Vernon's penthouse) to give the proceedings a [...] "sort of unreality".|$|R
40|$|To reduce pilot contamination, a {{downlink}} precoding algorithm was {{put forward}} for Large-scale MIMO system. It set the Least Square (LS) criterion to the objective function, and then solved the precoding matrices with the Lagrange multiplier method. In the solving, it utilized {{not only the}} estimated channel information but also the pilot contamination information, which was acquired from some <b>blank</b> resource <b>elements,</b> so could more precisely reduce pilot contamination. Based on simulation results, it was shown that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than popular Large-scale MIMO precoding algorithms, e. g. single-cell Zero-Forcing precoding and multi-cell MMSE precoding.

40|$|Abstract. Electromagnetic forming is a non-conventional {{forming process}} and is {{classified}} as a high-speed forming process. It provides certain advantages as compared to conventional forming processes: improved formability, high repeatability and productivity, reduction in tooling cost and reduction of springback and of wrinkling. However, various process parameters affect {{the performance of the}} electromagnetic forming system. Finite element simulations are very useful to optimize a process because they can reduce time and costs. With the aim of investigating the effects of the process parameters on the deformed <b>blank</b> geometry, finite <b>element</b> simulations of an electromagnetic sheet bulging test have been performed in this work. Furthermore the role of first impulse of discharged current is also investigated...|$|R

40|$|Problems such as wrinkling, {{excessive}} local thinning and springback are investigated when {{forming a}} non-symmetric part. Wrinkling in the unsupported region between {{punch and die}} is best eliminated by placing various shapes of drawbead. The drawbeads help constraint the material flow locally during forming. Excessive thinning is observed where the vertical wall of the part is deep drawn. In order to increase the minimum thickness of the drawn part, the blank is trimmed where the flange remains large after forming to allow the material to flow more easily into the die cavity. The minimum thickness is improved by 10 %. At the same time, the blank is optimized by saving 35 % from the original blank size. Springback after forming is also investigated. Less springback was observed with the drawbeads and the optimized <b>blank.</b> Incremental finite <b>element</b> code, OPTRIS, is used to conduct finite element computations to study the forming sequence and springback. The computational results are studied to determine the drawbead shapes and locations. Adaptive meshing skill is adopted during the computation.

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} current methods of {{producing}} tailored blanks (TBs), {{together with the}} areas of applications and possible problems. A new method of producing TBs, based on simple shear, has been proposed. It is {{a variant of the}} process, which originally has been developed as a means of refining grain structure of metals by Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP). Further development of ECAP towards an incremental version of this process (I-ECAP) enables processing very long billets and varying their thickness. Taking advantage of the latter, two different experimental rigs have been built in order to check feasibility of producing TBs by I-ECAP. TBs produced in this way have been named Tailored Sheared <b>Blanks</b> (TSBs). Finite <b>element</b> simulation of the process realised on one of these rigs provided an insight into the mechanism of changing blank thickness and strain distribution. The proposed method has several advantages such as lack of welding seams, possibility of thinning as well as thickening initial blanks, creation of thickness steps {{on both sides of the}} blank and flexible length of thickness transition...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} {{examines}} some key {{factors that influence}} student engagement in a blended learning environment, in particular, when using interactive online resources to learn Carpentry theory. The participants were volunteers from two parallel classes of secondary school students working toward Level 1 Building Construction and Allied Trade Skills Certificate designed for secondary schools by the Building Construction Industry Training Organisation. The participant researcher was also the teacher for both classes. Data in this case study was collected by observation, reflective journal writing, student records, group discussion and analysis of student course results. It showed that the students responded positively to the blended classroom environment and the interactive online resources developed by the researcher for this study. The blended learning environment in the classroom increased student participation, aided classroom management, and more than halved the time needed for both classes to finish the Instrumental Drawing Unit Standard 7502 while the interactive online resources enhanced student engagement and achievement {{in other areas of}} their theory. Students responded positively to the automated formative feedback and were encouraged by knowing their results instantly; working to gain top results and correct answers rather than just completing an activity by filling in the <b>blanks.</b> A competitive <b>element</b> was introduced by integrating a timer into the resources. Challenges encountered included limited access to computers and the necessity for students to share computers, a network failure which made the online resources unavailable for an extended period, and storage problems for the online resources to allow them to be accessed from the online learning environment at school and at home. This study concluded that technology can enable teachers to enhance their teaching and enrich the student learning environment through the introduction of a variety of media. Students still depended on face-to-face teacher input but, in the blended classroom environment and the online environment, the role of the teacher changed noticeably to a role of facilitator...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{nature of}} police work in South African cities places {{profound}} demands on police officers everyday. The impacts of trauma on {{police officers are}} well known. However, the reason as to why police officers do not seek help, particularly from in-house counselling (IHe) services within the SAPS has received minimal attention in the literature. The aim of this research, is therefore to examine, and to understand police officers' perceptions ofIHC services and the willingness to use them. In particular, {{to see what the}} range of perceptions is, to see if this varies by demographic variables and lastly, to see if this is related to perceptions of organisational support. In addition to this, as the context for the use of psychological services is the exposure to traumatic events, the degree of exposure and examining its relevance to the primary aim will also need to be assessed. The current study adopted a non-experimental research design, which was categorised as cross-sectional in design. A non-probability procedure was also utilised. A sample of sixty-five (65) police officers from the Midrand headquarters was obtained. The procedure involved the anonymous completion of several self-report measures which included a biographical <b>blank</b> with open-ended <b>elements</b> regarding the use ofIHe services, the Use ofIHC Services Checklist, Perceptions of IHe Services, Perceived Organisational Support (POS) Scale, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Exposure to Traumatic Events Scale. Results from the correlation analysis reflected a negative correlation between Trauma Severity, Use ofIHC services and POS. However a positive correlation was found between Use ofIHCservices and age, POS and Perceptions of IHe services as well as Use ofIHC services and POS. T-tests also revealed a difference between black and white police officers, as well as male and female police officers with regards to Perceptions of IHe services. They additionally revealed a difference between black and white police officers with regards to Use ofIHC services. Analysis of variance suggested that {{there is a difference between}} language groups with regards to the Use of IHC services. Additionally, when participants were given the opportunity to express themselves in the open-ended questions, they revealed that issues of confidentiality, cultural differences, SAPS Knowledge, and the advertising of IHe services affect their up-take of IRe services. The study underlines the need for additional research, including longitudinal investigation into the reasons why police officers to do utilise me services...|$|R
