We sought to investigate, in a large sample of hospital admissions, the possible association between blood groups and VTE. The study was based on the discharge hospital sheets (DSOs) of patients admitted to the Hospital of Ferrara, region Emilia-Romagna (RER), Italy, 2000 and 2011. We selected all patients with first or second discharge ICD- 9 -CM diagnosis code of: acute pulmonary heart disease (APHD); pulmonary embolism (PE); phlebitis and thrombophlebitis (PVT); other venous embolism and thrombosis (OVET). Total population was divided into subgroups by gender, age, and presence of risk factors: arterial hypertension, diabetes, overweight-obesity, dyslipidemia, homocystinemia, coagulation defects, gout, and cancer. Moreover, we considered all patients in whom a <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>determination</b> was recorded. There were 345, 607 admissions, regarding 164, 438 different patients. Of these, 65, 402 had their <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>determination.</b> Among these patients, 1, 270 had a PE, 828 had a PVT, and 923 had an OVET. In the multivariate analysis, patients with non O blood group, and with A-allele, had a significantly higher risk for VTE (p= 0. 001) whereas the presence of group O appeared to be protective (p= 0. 001). This study shows an increased VTE risk in subjects with non O-groups genotypes, ranging from 20 % to 35 %. In the real world of everyday medical practice, the decision of whether to test for thrombophilia patients with VTE is controversial, due to organizational and economic constraints.

In its present configuration (after some modifications have been brought in), the MG 50 offers significant advantages which will be discussed in detail. For a batch of 58 samples tested in one hour on twelve channels a single technician is required instead of 3 to 4; sample supply of equipment is therefore made in a more regular way. In case of run interrupt a single series of 12 determinations is implicated and can be immediately checked. The whole analysis process is limited to twice 11 minutes due to the continuous agitation of discs. The tubing pump priming is automatically performed and the reagent homogeneity is better insured; the presence of dilution tubes is easily controlled.

The overall aim of this study was to compare the molecular diversity of ABO alleles with various phenotypes, and to contribute to our knowledge of the ABO gene and encoded glycosyltransferases. Novel alleles (six Aweak, eleven Bweak, seven O) were identified containing single-point mutations. Structure/function studies explained the weakening of some B subgroup glycosyltransferases. Two new hybrid Ax alleles were characterised. Analysis of introns 2 - 5 revealed 44 previously unknown, allele-related polymorphisms that proved valuable allelic markers. These findings enabled localisation of cross-over regions in two other new hybrids: 1) an O 1 v allele fused with an A 2 allele, 2) the novel O 1 bantu-A 2 combination that explained the Abantu phenotype. Phylogenetic and population analyses indicated that O 1 bantu is a unique and distinct evolutionary lineage so far only found among individuals of African descent. Of clinical importance, a new approach to ABO genotyping was developed that identifies all common alleles, most null and weak A/B subgroups as well as hybrid alleles resulting from recombinational crossing-over events.

Blood group O was common in Brahmin, Chhetri, Tamang, Lama, Gurung, Sherpa, Terai Brahmin, Muslim and Yadav ethnicities; blood group A was common in Newar, Rai, Magar, Limbu and Sanyasi ethnicitites; and blood group B was common in Tharu and Marwari ethnicities. Conclusions: Blood group O was found to be the most common blood group while AB was the rarest one. It was found that blood group O is the more common in Sherpa, Brahmin and Yadav; A in Limbu, Rai and Newar; and B in Tharu and Marwari ethnicities. _______________________________________________________________________________________ Keywords: ABO; blood group; ethnic distribution...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, the {{molecular}} basis {{for most of}} the blood group systems has been investigated intensively. Many blood group genes have been cloned and the polymorphisms of clinically significant blood group systems have been elucidated. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the molecular genetic variation found in various phenotypes and in different ethnic populations, to identify new alleles, to try to understand how they contribute to the different phenotypes and to improve current DNA-based blood grouping methods for use in transfusion medicine. A single-tube PCR-ASP method for JK <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>determination</b> was developed for clinical use. The genomic organisation of the JK blood group locus was characterised and the molecular basis of the Jk(a-b-) phenotype associated with the absence of the urea transporter JK glycoprotein in erythrocytes was elucidated in different ethnic groups. A DNA-based method was designed for detection of silent Jk alleles at the JK locus. The relationship between the ABO alleles and the number of tandem repeats in a potential enhancer region that contains a transcription factor-binding motif was defined. A large collection of clinical samples with serological ABO discrepancies was screened for known allelic variations. Analysis of genomic DNA of all exons and two regulatory regions of the ABO gene revealed fifteen novel A and B alleles that were associated with A and B subgroups. Finally, the phenotype/genotype correlation for clinically significant blood group systems in Jordanian blood donors was studied for the first time to investigate the reliability of current genotyping methods in populations of Arabian descent. The correlation was high, similar to that found in Caucasians. In conclusion, our knowledge of the alleles responsible for different blood group phenotypes has been increased, which has resulted in improved clinical genotyping methods...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether there is a relationship between erectile dysfunction (ED), thought to be a vascular disease, and AB 0 <b>blood</b> <b>group.</b> Material and Method: The study included 350 people abiding by the study criteria who applied to our clinic from April 2012 -April 2015. The patients were divided into two groups including those with ED (Group 1) and those without (<b>Group</b> 2). Age, <b>blood</b> <b>group,</b> IIEF- 5 score and presence of additional diseases were recorded. Erectile functions were analyzed according to <b>blood</b> <b>group.</b> Results: There was no difference between the mean age of 111 patients with ED and that of 239 patients without ED included in the study (p = 0. 284). There was no difference between patients in the two groups in terms of smoking, alcohol use, hypertension and diabetes (p > 0. 05). Among patients in the ED group, the mean IIEF- 5 score according to <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> was 19. 8 ± 5. 04 in the 0 <b>blood</b> <b>group,</b> 16. 5 ± 5. 2 in the A <b>blood</b> <b>group,</b> 17. 2 ± 5. 3 in the B <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> and 13. 3 ± 3. 02 in the AB <b>blood</b> <b>group.</b> The IIEF- 5 scores of individuals in the 0 <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> were significantly high compared to individuals in other <b>blood</b> <b>groups</b> (p = 0. 004). Logistic regression analysis found that compared to the 0 <b>blood</b> <b>group,</b> the erectile dysfunction risk was 3. 9 times greater for the A <b>blood</b> <b>group,</b> 3. 5 times greater for the B <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> and 4. 7 times greater for the AB <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> (p = 0. 001) (Table 3). Conclusion: The risk of erectile dysfunction was significantly increased for individuals in the A, B and AB <b>blood</b> <b>groups</b> compared to individuals in the 0 <b>blood</b> <b>group...</b>|$|R
40|$|The ABO <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> {{system was}} {{discovered}} by Karl Landsteiner in 1901. Since then, scientists have speculated on an association between different pathologies and the ABO <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> system. The aim of this pilot {{study was to determine}} the significance between different blood types of the ABO <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> system and certain pathologies. We included 237 patients with known diagnosis, <b>blood</b> <b>group,</b> sex, and age in the study. As a statistical method, the Chi-square test was chosen. In some cases, a significant association between the <b>blood</b> <b>groups</b> and defined diseases could be determined. Carriers of <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O suffered from ulcus ventriculi and gastritis (X 21 = 78. 629, p < 0. 001), colitis ulcerosa and duodenitis (X 21 = 5. 846, p < 0. 016), whereas male patients carrying <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A tended to contract different types of tumours. In patients with intestinal tumours, females with <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A were more likely to develop the pathology, whereas in males, the <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O dominated. The development of cholelithiasis was found, above all, in patients with <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O, which differed from other research where a correlation between this pathology and <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A was found...|$|R
