5|$|In June 1942, JG77 {{was moved}} to the Mediterranean theater and took part in the air <b>battles</b> <b>over</b> Malta before {{relocating}} to Tunisia and participating in the North African Campaign. On 13 October 1942 he accounted for three Spitfire fighters from 185 and 1345 Squadron near the Sicilian coast. I./JG77 soon transferred to North Africa and took part in the Tunisian Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Like {{in other}} {{games in the}} series, Sonic {{collects}} rings scattered throughout levels; contact with certain obstacles and enemies scatters them away, and Sonic dies if he touches an enemy without any rings. Unlike previous titles, Secret Rings does not feature a life counter or game over screen, but instead Sonic reappears at the last visited checkpoint after dying, although the player will have to restart a mission if they fail a specified objective. The game contains 100 missions (including boss <b>battles)</b> <b>over</b> the course of eight levels. New missions, cutscenes, and sometimes new levels are unlocked by completing missions. Successful missions earn Sonic experience points, which advance him levels.|$|E
5|$|The 40th Infantry Division {{shipped out}} to Korea in January 1952, and shortly thereafter, Bleak was {{promoted}} to Sergeant. His unit was assigned to a mountainous area near Minari-gol, South Korea, along the 38th Parallel. By that point in the war, the fronts had largely stabilized, and the duty in the area was characterized by constant, low-level trench warfare and continued <b>battles</b> <b>over</b> the same ground which produced high casualties. Bleak served as a field medic, assisting troops {{on the front lines}} instead of in Mobile Army Surgical Hospital units.|$|E

5|$|Vanderbeek was {{a strong}} proponent of the {{proposed}} arena in Newark, which first received funding from the city council during Puck Holdings' ownership in 2002. After legal <b>battles</b> <b>over</b> both eminent domain and the city's financial participation in the arena project, the final deal was approved by council in October 2004, during {{the early months of}} the lockout, and the groundbreaking occurred almost exactly a year later. Nonetheless, in January 2006, financial issues threatened to halt the deal, as the Devils did not provide the city with a required letter of credit until the last possible day.|$|E
5|$|Born in Giessen, Nordmann {{volunteered for}} {{military}} service in the Luftwaffe of the Third Reich in 1936. Following flight training, he was posted to Jagdgeschwader 132 (JG 132—132nd Fighter Wing) in October 1938. After a series of redesignations his unit was subordinated to Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG 51—51st Fighter Wing). He fought in the aerial <b>battles</b> <b>over</b> Poland, France and Britain, claiming nine victories. Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, he was appointed Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) of the IV. Gruppe (4th Group) of JG 51. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 1 August 1941 following his 31st aerial victory and received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves on 16 September 1941 after 59 victories. The Oak Leaves grades to the Knight's Cross was Germany's highest military decoration {{at the time of}} its presentation to Nordmann.|$|E
5|$|Just as World War I had a {{significant}} impact on the college, World War II was pivotal in the college's history too. Within four days of the attack on Pearl Harbor, thirteen students withdrew from the college to join the military. The enrollment dropped from 2,077 students in 1940 to a low of 860 students (21% were men) in spring 1943. Faculty decreased to as low as 60 from 112 before the war had begun. Before the war was over, 3,500 SDSC graduates, students, former students, and faculty entered the armed forces, with 135 losing their lives. Not surprisingly for a city dominated by a naval base, a large majority joined the Navy. Others joined the Air Corps, participating in the Doolittle Raid over Japan and <b>battles</b> <b>over</b> the Philippines and the East Indies.|$|E

5|$|On 13 April, B-17s {{from the}} 97th and 301st Bomb Groups bombed Sicilian airfields at Castelvetrano and Trapani. The Italians lost 11 SM.82s {{destroyed}} and 16 damaged on the ground. At Trapani the Germans lost eight aircraft and 40 damaged {{for the loss}} of two B-17s to the island's fighter defences consisting of Bf 109s from JG 27. <b>Battles</b> <b>over</b> the airfields in the afternoon were inconclusive, costing the Axis one Ju 88 from II./KG 26 and the Allies an RAF a Spitfire from No. 232 Squadron RAF. That night, air raids killed four German fighter pilots from I./JG 53 while two Ju 88s from II./NJG 2 and III./KG 76 were lost.|$|E
5|$|Born in Braunschweig, Waldmann {{volunteered for}} {{service in the}} Luftwaffe in 1940. After {{training}} at various pilot and fighter-pilot schools, he was posted to Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG 52—52nd Fighter Wing), operating on the Eastern Front, in August 1942. Here Waldmann fought in the aerial <b>battles</b> <b>over</b> Stalingrad, the Caucasus, the Black Sea, and the Crimea. He was credited with 84 aerial victories before briefly being transferred to the Western Front, where he was credited with one aerial victory. Back on the Eastern Front, Waldmann accumulated further victories, bringing his score to 125 victories by end of May 1944. He then fought in the skies over France after the Western Allied Invasion of Normandy, claiming seven aerial victories, before converting to the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter in late 1944. Flying the Me 262, Waldmann shot down two North American P-51 Mustangs on 22 February 1945 before being killed in a mid-air collision {{with one of his}} squadron members on 18 March 1945 near Schwarzenbek, Holstein.|$|E
5|$|The British National Antarctic Expedition, later {{known as}} the Discovery Expedition, was a joint {{enterprise}} of the RGS and the Royal Society. A long-cherished dream of Markham's, it required all of his skills and cunning to bring the expedition to fruition, under naval command and largely staffed by naval personnel. Scott {{may not have been}} Markham's first choice as leader but, having decided on him, the older man's support remained constant. There were committee <b>battles</b> <b>over</b> the scope of Scott's responsibilities, with the Royal Society pressing to put a scientist in charge of the expedition's programme while Scott merely commanded the ship. Eventually, however, Markham's view prevailed; Scott was given overall command, and was promoted to the rank of commander before Discovery sailed for the Antarctic on 6 August 1901. King Edward VII, who showed a keen interest in the expedition, visited the Discovery the day before the ship left British shores in August 1901, and during the visit appointed Scott a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO), his personal gift.|$|E

5|$|The game spans six levels, each lasting {{about five}} minutes, {{with a variety}} of boss <b>battles.</b> <b>Over</b> the course of the game, the plot is {{revealed}} through cutscenes using the game's own graphic engine. Gameplay consists of a player controlling a flying dragon and his rider through an aiming reticle that can be moved over the whole screen with the D-pad; the player must shoot a variety of enemies (ranging from machines to monsters) in a 3D post-apocalyptic fantasy environment of barren landscapes and mysterious ruins of a fallen civilization. Progression through the levels is made at a predetermined pace, as the player is constantly set along a rail of gameplay. The only time the game pauses is during boss battles. The field of vision can be directed with the aiming reticle on the x and y-axis, but the overall direction of travel is predetermined. The dragon follows the reticle movements, allowing the player to avoid enemy projectiles and obstacles.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of home leave, on 17 June 1915 Manstein was reassigned as {{assistant}} general staff officer of operations to the Tenth Army, commanded by Max von Gallwitz. Soon promoted to captain, he learned first-hand how to plan and conduct offensive operations as the Tenth Army undertook successful attacks on Poland, Lithuania, Montenegro, and Albania. During offensive operations at Verdun in early 1916, Manstein was stationed with Gallwitz and his staff at a new headquarters near the action. He next served as a staff supply officer under General Fritz von Below and chief of staff Fritz von Lossberg at a command post near the River Somme; the area {{was the scene of}} several <b>battles</b> <b>over</b> the course of the war. British and French operations from July to November 1916 forced a German withdrawal over the winter to the Hindenburg Line, a series of defensive positions between Verdun and Lens. Manstein continued to serve under Below until October 1917, when he was transferred as chief of staff to the 4th Cavalry Division, serving in Riga during the German occupation of the area. As a result of the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, Manstein's unit was no longer needed on the Eastern Front; he was reassigned to the 213th Infantry Division near Reims. The German Imperial Army saw some minor successes in the area but was beginning to lose the war. The armistice was signed on 11 November 1918.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} {{two weeks}} on the peninsula were mostly quiet. On June25, though, a surprise attack by McClellan {{began a series of}} six major <b>battles</b> <b>over</b> the next week near Richmond—the Seven Days Battles. On the first day, as Lee led the Army of Northern Virginia toward the Union lines, McClellan preempted him with an attack at Oak Grove. Lee's men successfully warded off the Union assault, and Lee continued with his plans. The next morning, the Confederates attacked the Army of the Potomac at Mechanicsville. Union forces turned back the Confederate onslaught, inflicting heavy losses. After Mechanicsville, McClellan's army withdrew to a position behind Boatswain's Swamp. There, on June27, the Union soldiers suffered another Confederate attack, this time at Gaines's Mill. In the resulting battle, the Confederates launched numerous failed charges, until a final concerted attack broke the Union line, resulting in the only clear Confederate victory during the Seven Days. The action at Garnett's and Golding's Farm, fought next, was merely a set of skirmishes. Lee attacked the Union Army at the Battle of Savage's Station on June29 and the battles of Glendale and White Oak Swamp June30, but all three battles were inconclusive. After this series of conflicts that inflicted thousands of casualties on both armies, McClellan began to position his forces to an imposing natural position atop Malvern Hill.|$|E
