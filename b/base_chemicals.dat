50|$|Currently, many {{human beings}} {{come into contact}} or consume, {{directly}} or indirectly, many harmful materials and chemicals daily. In addition, countless other forms {{of plant and animal}} life are also exposed. C2C seeks to remove dangerous technical nutrients (synthetic materials such as mutagenic materials, heavy metals and other dangerous chemicals) from current life cycles. If the materials we come into contact with and are exposed to on a daily basis are not toxic and do not have long term health effects, then the health of the overall system can be better maintained. For example, a fabric factory can eliminate all harmful technical nutrients by carefully reconsidering what chemicals they use in their dyes to achieve the colours they need and attempt to do so with fewer <b>base</b> <b>chemicals.</b>|$|E

30|$|Within plants, oil {{has become}} a {{starting}} material for the synthesis of numerous valuable chemicals. Oil itself is not generally treated as a biomass. However, let us base our discussion on a broader view of biomass: a renewable resource especially {{if it is not}} exploited yet and/or treated as a waste material. Metzger and Eissen pointed out that rapeseed oil has the lowest gross energy requirement (GER) of all the <b>base</b> <b>chemicals</b> [6]. (<b>Base</b> <b>chemicals</b> are chemicals produced > million ton per year worldwide and are starting materials for a large number of other products). The review also points out that “approximately 51 % of the renewable raw materials used at present in Germany are fats and oils, carbohydrates are included in the other 6 %!” [6]. Apart from biodiesel, obtaining biosurfactants, engineered lipids (for nutritional purposes) and new materials from fats/oils are all industrial level processes. It may be pertinent to point out that while it is still not a practical method, aqueous enzyme oil extraction (again the role of biocatalysts!) remain a very desirable technique to develop [7, 8]. More important, the concept of biorefinary is tied up with deriving platform molecules from rest of the plant material after the seeds are harvested [9].|$|E

30|$|More promisingly, recent papers documenting process {{development}} procedures show an {{increased use of}} 2 -MeTHF in large scale chemical synthesis [8]. Table  5 does indicate that greener solvents are available, and bio-based solvents are well represented in the ‘recommended’ and ‘inbetween recommended and problematic’ categories. The readily available bio-based solvents tend to be protic solvents, but also esters, ketones, and ethers. This leaves a need for green and renewable hydrocarbon solvents and dipolar aprotic solvent in particular. Not indicated in Table  5 are unconventional routes to bio-based solvents. Developments in the conversion of biomass into aromatic <b>base</b> <b>chemicals</b> [76], and specialised routes to methyl ethyl ketone [77], and acetonitrile [78], mean that an increasingly diverse number of solvents have prospects of a renewable feedstock.|$|E

Due to the very complex topological changes of the interfaces (gas-liquid and liquid-solid), a correct description of the interaction between the phases is extremely difficult. In this paper a novel simulation approach will be presented for complex multiphase flows accounting for i) all important mutual interactions between the phases ii) complex changes in the topology of the interfaces. In view of its fundamental nature, it is an important complementary tool in developing closure equations for Eulerian and/or Lagrangian approaches, which do not capture in sufficient detail the complex topological changes of the interfaces...|$|E
