60|$|This {{second point}} being evidently the {{practical}} one, I had better give my reason. Exhibition pugilism {{is essentially a}} branch of Art: that is to say, it acts and attracts by propagating feeling. The feeling it propagates is pugnacity. Sense of danger, dread of danger, impulse to batter and destroy what threatens and opposes, triumphant delight in succeeding: this is pugnacity, the great adversary of the social impulse to live and let live; to establish our rights by shouldering our share of the social burden; to face and examine danger instead of striking at it; to understand everything {{to the point of}} pardoning (and righting) everything; to conclude an amnesty with Nature wide enough to include even those we know the worst of: namely, ourselves. If two men quarrelled, and asked the Borough Council to lend them a room to fight it out in with their fists, on the ground that a few minutes' hearty punching of one another's heads would work off their bad blood and leave them better friends, each desiring, not victory, but satisfaction, I am not sure that I should not vote for compliance. But if a syndicate of showmen came and said, Here we have two men who have no quarrel, but who will, if you pay them, fight before your constituency and thereby make a great propaganda of pugnacity in it, sharing the profits with us and with you, I should indignantly oppose the proposition. And if the majority were against me, I should try to persuade them to at least impose the condition that the fight should be with naked fists under the old rules, so that the combatants should, like Sayers and Langham, depend on <b>bunging</b> up each other's eyes rather than, like the modern knocker-out, giving one another concussion of the brain.|$|E

50|$|Participants are {{required}} to eliminate targets called Jewel (seen {{in the form of}} Raons). Each Jewel is assigned a point value for being destroyed. Point values include -5, 5, 10 and 25. Shots fired at the enemy will not cause damage, but can destroy land. Teams win the game by rounding up at least 100 points, or <b>bunging</b> (hitting the land underneath them until they drop down) their opponents until none are left.|$|E
50|$|In Score mode, the {{objective}} is to kill or bunge opponents until the enemy life counter reaches zero. <b>Bunging</b> is when you can destroy the land around the opponent's area and cause him/her to fall. The lives allotted in Score mode relies on the amount of team players participating in a match. For a team composed of n players, there are (n + 1) lives. Lives are pooled between players in a team. A team wins if the opposition's life counter reaches zero, or if there are no more opponents left on the field. Dead players, upon dying, have a choice of their drop location and drop at that point in the field in a set amount of 4 turns after the point is chosen. Should a player not hit land, he or she will continue to fall and the team life counter will not go down, but instead cause the player to reselect the drop location and wait another 4 turns. The player's drop location is slightly affected by wind conditions.|$|E

40|$|In 2002 a British Salmonella {{monitoring}} programme for pigs was introduced, {{with the intention}} of reducing the prevalence of Salmonella in pigs at slaughter and hence the number of Salmonella cases in humans attributable to British pig meat. While the primary focus has so far arguably been on reducing the prevalence of Salmonella in slaughter pigs, the programme is intended to reduce Salmonella across the whole production chain. In support of this programme, and as part of a large risk-based study, a risk assessment and cost-effectiveness analysis were developed to investigate the effect of the following interventions: vaccination, feeding of organic acids, rodent control, anal <b>bunging</b> and washing and drying of the carcass at dehairing...|$|E
40|$|Along with poultry, pig meat {{has been}} {{identified}} as a potential source of human food borne Salmonella infection. In order to minimise the risk of human illness, a number of EU countries have initiated Salmonella monitoring programmes for pigs (e. g. Denmark, Germany, UK) and EU requirements for control of Salmonella in pigs will be {{based on the results of}} recent surveys together with risk assessment and economic studies that are under way. However, control programmes cannot be successful unless practical interventions are available for pig fanners and producers to implement. Therefore, as part of a large risk-based study investigating control of Salmonella in pigs, a full British farm-to-consumption risk assessment has been developed in order to predict the impact of interventions upon the risk of human disease. The interventions investigated within the risk assessment were: vaccination, feeding of organic acids, rodent control, anal <b>bunging</b> and washing and drying of the carcass at dehairing...|$|E

First Codex Alimentarius, in international field, then EC Regulation 853 / 2004 ensure that animals that have such hide, skin or fleece conditions that there is an unacceptable risk of contamination of meat are not slaughtered for human consumption unless they era cleaned beforehand. In order to comply with such provisions, the operators must ensure that proper own check procedures have been fixed; the evaluation of such procedures is a priority for the official vet who must define standards of cleanliness. Under normal processing condition, contamination from the viscera is prevented by rodding, <b>bunging</b> and the intact remove of the viscera components.
