40|$|Abstract—Recently, we {{proposed}} a frequency-domain block signal detection using maximum likelihood detection (MLD) employing QR decomposition and M-algorithm (QRM-MLD) for the cyclic prefix inserted single-carrier (CP-SC) <b>block</b> <b>transmissions.</b> However, {{if the number of}} surviving-symbol candidates is small, the achievable bit error rate (BER) performance degrades, because the probability of removing the correct symbol-candidates at early stages increases. In this paper, to solve this problem, we insert the known training sequence into each data block instead of CP. This SC transmission is called the training sequence-aided SC (TA-SC) <b>block</b> <b>transmissions.</b> We show by computer simulation that the TA-SC can achieve much better BER performance than the CP-SC if the number of surviving symbol-candidates is limited.

30|$|As {{a second}} {{contribution}} of this paper, we present iterative (turbo-like) pilot-assisted channel estimators for both OFDM and SC <b>block</b> <b>transmissions.</b> Differently from the turbo-based channel estimators already proposed for SC transmissions over doubly selective channels [25, 26], the proposed turbo-like channel estimators are nonadaptive and hence {{more suitable for}} <b>block</b> <b>transmissions.</b> For both OFDM and SC cases, the proposed iterative channel estimators firstly estimate the time-domain channel exploiting the BEM, and then transform the time-domain channel into the frequency domain for equalization purposes. This strategy {{is similar to that}} used for OFDM doubly selective channel estimation in [21, 22]. However, differently from the channel estimators of [21, 22], the proposed channel estimators exploit the reliability of the estimated data and can thus also work in the presence of nonorthogonal pilot designs.|$|R

50|$|The {{infrared}} {{atmospheric window}} is the overall dynamic {{property of the}} earth's atmosphere, {{taken as a whole}} at each place and occasion of interest, that lets some infrared radiation from the cloud tops and land-sea surface pass directly to space without intermediate absorption and re-emission, and thus without heating the atmosphere. It cannot be defined simply as a part or set of parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, because the spectral composition of window radiation varies greatly with varying local environmental conditions, such as water vapour content and land-sea surface temperature, and because few or no parts of the spectrum are simply not absorbed at all, and because some of the diffuse radiation is passing nearly vertically upwards and some is passing nearly horizontally. A large gap in the absorption spectrum of water vapor, the main greenhouse gas, is most important in the dynamics of the window.

5000|$|An {{isolation}} transformer is a transformer used to transfer electrical power {{from a source}} of alternating current (AC) power to some equipment or device while isolating the powered device from the power source, usually for safety reasons. Isolation transformers provide galvanic isolation and are used to protect against electric shock, to suppress electrical noise in sensitive devices, or to transfer power between two circuits which must not be connected. A transformer sold for isolation is often built with special insulation between primary and secondary, and is specified to withstand a high voltage between windings. Isolation transformers <b>block</b> <b>transmission</b> of the DC component in signals from one circuit to the other, but allow AC components in signals to pass. Transformers that have a ratio of 1 to 1 between the primary and secondary windings are often used to protect secondary circuits and individuals from electrical shocks between energized conductors and earth ground. Suitably designed {{isolation transformer}}s block interference caused by ground loops. Isolation transformers with electrostatic shields are used for power supplies for sensitive equipment such as computers, medical devices, or laboratory instruments.|$|E
