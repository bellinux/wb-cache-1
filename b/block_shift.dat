40|$|In this brief, a {{generalized}} topology of <b>block</b> <b>shift</b> networks (BSNs), named generalized <b>block</b> <b>shift</b> network (GBSN), is proposed for interconnection networks in clusters. The BSNs possess many desirable topological features, such as flexibility in node degree, small diameter and average distance, and easy VLSI implementation. However, the regular structure of each {{block in the}} BSN is not suitable for the networks in clusters that usually have arbitrary number of nodes. The proposed GBSN offers a balance between regularity and irregularity of the interconnection networks for clusters. We also analyze the embedding of the BSN into the GBSN, and discuss the versatility of the GBSN in terms of slowdown factors compared to the BSN. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

The government activity has resulted in a number of positive developments in many cases as a result of community consultation and engagement. A common characterisation at community forums and other public sphere debates about resource developments has been a characterisation of mining workers as a homogenous group of mainly males who are ‘barely civilised’ residing in poorly constructed work camps and creating general community anomie. Miners are subsequently equated with various social ills. This paper questions one of the assumptions expressed within public forums.

40|$|Abstract—As an {{interconnection}} network, hypercube topology offers certain advantages such as {{high data}} bandwidth and low message latency to achieve computational efficiency. However, a significant drawback of this topology is {{that the number of}} ports per node increases with the number of nodes. In addition, in many applications not all the links are used equally frequently, and links on certain dimensions may be idle most of the time during a computation. This suggests that we can provide connections over certain dimensions only {{to reduce the number of}} links and can still attain comparable performance. In this paper, we propose a new network, called the <b>Block</b> <b>Shift</b> Network (BSN), for constructing very large multicomputer systems for efficient parallel processing. The network is defined through a pair of parameters and cost and performance of a BSN can be controlled by carefully selecting appropriate parameters defining the network. Actually, many popular networks such as the hypercube, the shuffle-exchange, and the complete networks are instances of the BSN. The topological properties of the BSN with different parameters are analyzed and compared with those of existing popular networks. Basic data movement operations on the BSN are also designed and analyzed. The results show that the BSN with certain parameters can surpasses the hypercube in several respects while retaining most of its advantages, especially when the traffic has the locality property.

The reference frame, World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS 84), within which a user ascertains these coordinates is essentially geocentric. In Jamaica all coordinate data and mapping {{are based on a}} non-geocentric coordinate system known as the Jamaican Datum of 1969 (JAD 69), which like many others around the world was realized by making basic assumptions about the geoid-ellipsoid separation at the origin. WGS 84 coordinates are therefore not compatible with the JAD 69. This paper presents the results of work carried out to define {{the relationship between the two}} coordinate systems, through three types of transformation parameters, namely Block Shifts, Molodensky and Seven Parameter Similarity. Three of the forty-two primary control stations together with a Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS), previously tied to the island network, forms a fiducial network at which WGS 84 coordinates were determined. The two coordinate data sets for the four fiducial stations were used to solve the parameters. Tests were carried out on nine points with coordinates known in both systems. The results indicate that the <b>Block</b> <b>Shift</b> and Molodensky values transforms WGS 84 coordinates to JAD 69, accurate to ± 1 - 2 m and the seven parameter similarity values produce JAD 69 coordinates accurate to ± 0. 5 m or better.

Methods: Participants received 0. 0 g/kg, 0. 4 g/kg or 0. 6 g/kg of alcohol in a between-subjects design. Healthy, heavy and light social alcohol users (n = 96) completed both lexical and pictorial cue versions of an alcohol-shifting task. Participants were instructed to respond to target stimuli by pressing the spacebar, but to ignore distracter stimuli. Errors towards distracter stimuli were analysed using a series of mixed-model ANOVAs, with between-subjects factors of challenge and drinking status and within-subjects factors of distracter type (alcohol, neutral) and <b>block</b> (<b>shift,</b> non-shift). Results: Lexical commission error data indicated a main effect of distracter (F [1, 90] = 43. 25, p < 0. 001, η 2 = 0. 33), which was qualified by a marginal interaction with challenge condition (F [2, 90] = 2. 77, p = 0. 068, η 2 = 0. 06). Following an acute high dose of alcohol participants made more errors towards alcohol distracters. Pictorial commission error data indicated {{a significant main effect}} of distracter (F [1, 90] = 67. 40, p < 0. 001, η 2 = 0. 43), such that all participants made more errors towards neutral image distracters versus alcohol distracter images.

40|$|Information Detection Hardware System {{plays an}} {{important}} role in search engines or matching systems such as text search, pattern matching, image matching, face detection and many others. The objective of this dissertation is to design an ultra-fast parallel information detector for search systems employing CAM and SHIFT circuits to enhance search performance of the systems. This structure has not been proposed by other research works. CAM is designed basing on 2 -port RAM blocks on FPGA. The CAM design, which is flexible and effective on various FPGA platforms, returns multi-match values in parallel. The search systems are designed for 1 -D data and 2 -D data basing on CAM. The proposed system for 1 -D data has a simple structure. It consists of multiple CAM blocks and SHIFT circuits operating in parallel. The results are determined by an AND logic circuit. The proposed system architecture for 2 -D data is similar to the 1 -D data system. However, in the 2 -D data system, the system only employs one CAM block, one SHIFT circuit, OR logic circuit, AND logic circuit and an FSA to control the system operations. The purposes of the FSA are to save logic resources, and to circulate each input and distance value of query data to the single CAM, SHIFT, OR and AND logic circuit. The 2 -D data system can be used for exact image matching or approximate image matching with the corresponding search patterns. The search pattern is defined as a combination of query data inputs and their distance values. The search pattern is applied to the system for data detection or pattern matching. There are search patterns for 1 -D data and 2 -D data. Besides, the multi-core system is also proposed by combining many search cores with a 16 -bit DSP. Each core can be the proposed system on 1 -D data or 2 -D data operating in parallel. The DSP independently works with the single search cores, controls the system, and performs calculation of search results for specific applications. By combined with the DSP, performance of data detection and processing of the system is improved. In general, the proposed systems have simple structures and do not use any complex computations or micro-processors for searching data. This increases the search performance, saves the least search time and clock cycles. The advantage of the proposed systems is ultra-fast search time by employing parallel structures and CAM 2 ̆ 7 s multi-match values in concurrence. The search time of the 1 -D data system is mainly consumed by CAM blocks, SHIFT, AND circuits. In the 2 -D data system, the search time is the number of inputs multiplied by executive clock cycles of CAM <b>block,</b> <b>SHIFT,</b> OR, AND circuits. The search time of the proposed systems is the fastest among all systems. The proposed systems can be used as a common accelerator for a variety of applications such as text search, temperature analysis, DNA sequence search (1 -D data); face detection, pattern matching, pattern recognitions, authentication with watermarking, motion detection (2 -D data); stereoscopy applications (3 -D data) and so on. The proposed systems are implemented on FPGA in advance for functional verification then designed on an ASIC to make sure that the systems can operate on a physical chip. There are 2 full chips which are successfully implemented by using 0. 18 m CMOS technology, and 1 chip is designed on 65 nm SOI technology. One of them is dedicated to the 1 -D data system with 0. 18 m CMOS technology, and the other ones are designed for the 2 -D data systems with 0. 18 m CMOS technology and low power 65 nm SOI technology. Finally, the proposed systems for 1 -D data and 2 -D data have been successfully implemented on hardware in both FPGA and ASIC. The systems are designed using digital design flow. They can be exported under IP cores which independently operate on hardware platforms (FPGA or ASIC). Some applications of the systems have been developed on FPGA boards and presented in this dissertation to demonstrate the system operations in practical situations. 電気通信大学 201...|$|E

Some scholars argue that the practice of redistricting creates political polarization by making more homogeneous, ideologically distinct districts.

Many political scientists argue that redistricting practices have not played a major role in causing political polarization.

This naturally raises issues of fatigue and sleepiness when driving. There is limited research in respect to commuting behaviours of mine workers and {{little is known about the}} factors that influence these workers to leave site immediately following their shift.
