5|$|A Chief Justice of the King's <b>Bench</b> was {{assisted}} {{in his work}} {{by a number of}} Justices of the King's <b>Bench.</b> Occasionally appointed before 1272, the number fluctuated considerably between 1 and 4; from 1522, the number was fixed at 3. Provisions for a fourth were established in 1830, and a fifth in 1868. Following the dissolution of the Court of King's <b>Bench,</b> the remaining Justices because Justices of the Queen's <b>Bench</b> Division of the High Court of Justice.

5|$|After the Cournoyer goal, {{the goal}} judge refused {{to put the}} goal light on {{despite the fact that}} it was signalled a goal on the ice. In response, Alan Eagleson (seated across the ice from the Team Canada <b>bench)</b> {{attempted}} to reach the timer's <b>bench</b> to protest, causing a ruckus in the crowd as he made his way to the timer's <b>bench.</b> As he was being subdued by the Soviet police, the Canadian players headed over and Peter Mahovlich jumped over the boards to confront police with his stick. Eagleson was freed and the coaches escorted him across the ice to the <b>bench.</b> In anger, he shoved his fist to the Soviet crowd, as a few other Canadian supporters also gave the finger to the Soviets. The Soviets continued to play defensively. Sinden speculates the Soviets were willing to accept the tie and win the series on goal differential.|$|E

5|$|During its {{existence}} the King's Bench's jurisdiction initially covered {{a wide range}} of criminal matters, something significantly reduced later on, along with any business not claimed by the other courts, and any cases which concerned the monarch. It also acted as a court of appeal for the Exchequer of Pleas and Common Pleas, although it was not a court of last resort and required Parliament to sign off on its decisions. The creation of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in 1585 created a court from which King's <b>Bench</b> decisions could be appealed to, and with the expansion of the Exchequer Chamber's jurisdiction in 1830 the King's <b>Bench</b> ceased to be an appellate court. Thanks to the Bill of Westminster and other legal fictions, the King's <b>Bench</b> gained much of the Common Pleas's jurisdiction, although the Common Pleas remained the sole place where real property claims could be brought. The King's <b>Bench</b> was staffed by one Chief Justice, now the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, and a variable number of Puisne Justices; normally three, there were five serving when the King's <b>Bench</b> was dissolved. Those who chose not to retire became Justices of the High Court on the King's Bench's dissolution.|$|E

5|$|The Court of King's <b>Bench</b> (or Court of Queen's <b>Bench</b> {{during the}} reign of a female monarch), {{formally}} known as The Court of the King Before the King Himself, was an English court of common law in the English legal system.

5|$|The Court of King's <b>Bench</b> did {{act as an}} appellate body, hearing appeals {{from the}} Court of Common Pleas, eyre circuits, assize courts and local courts, but was not a court of last resort; its own records were sent to Parliament to be signed off on. The {{creation}} of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in 1585 created a court from which King's <b>Bench</b> decisions could be appealed to, and with {{the expansion of the}} Exchequer Chamber's jurisdiction in 1830 the King's <b>Bench</b> ceased to be an appellate court.

5|$|The Exchequer {{stood on}} an equal footing with the other Westminster courts (the Court of Common Pleas, Court of King's <b>Bench</b> and Court of Chancery), with cases {{transferred}} easily from one to another, although there were problems {{in the case of the}} Court of King's <b>Bench.</b> The traditional method for moving a case was the writ of supersedeas, but the King's <b>Bench</b> represented the monarch, who could not have writs placed against him. Instead, a clerk would bring the Red Book of the Exchequer to the King's <b>Bench</b> and assert that the case's claimant was an officer of the Exchequer, necessitating his trial there rather than in the King's <b>Bench.</b> The Exchequer maintained a clear rule with the other equity court, the Court of Chancery; a case heard in one could not be re-heard in the other. Apart from that, cases of equity could be heard by either court. The Exchequer had superior status over inferior courts of equity, able to take cases from them and countermand their decisions. The jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts also overlapped with that of the Exchequer, particularly in relation to the collection of tithes, and there are many records of disputes between the two.|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, which unified the Common Pleas, Exchequer, King's <b>Bench</b> and Court of Chancery into one body, the High Court of Justice, with the {{divisions}} between the courts to remain. Thus, while the reform epitomised by the Bill of Middlesex aided the King's <b>Bench</b> in the short term, it eventually led to its dissolution.|$|E
