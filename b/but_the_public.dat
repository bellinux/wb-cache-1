5|$|After {{the loss}} of these two railway {{executive}} positions, Beauregard spent time briefly {{at a variety of}} companies and civil engineering pursuits, but his personal wealth became assured when he was recruited as a supervisor of the Louisiana Lottery in 1877. He and former Confederate general Jubal Early presided over lottery drawings and made numerous public appearances, lending the effort some respectability. For 15 years the two generals served in these positions, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> became opposed to government-sponsored gambling and the lottery was closed down by the legislature.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hearing before}} the High Criminal Court of Appeal, due to take place on 8 May, was {{postponed}} to 22 May. Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, on the ninetieth day of his hunger strike, was brought to court in a wheelchair. All the defendants pleaded not guilty. Al-Khawaja and Abdulwahab Hussain told of being subjected to torture during the initial weeks of their detention, the former stating {{that he had been}} sexually assaulted and the latter that he had been forced to sign a written statement. On 19 June, defence lawyers asked the court to disregard confessions that the BICI report had suggested were obtained by torture <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> prosecutor insisted on their inclusion in the evidence. According to Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, these confessions were the sole evidence submitted to the court.|$|E
5|$|The five-storey City Terminus Hotel, which fronted the station, {{was opened}} in May 1867. It was an Italianate style hotel and forecourt, {{designed}} by E. M. Barry, and it provided {{many of the}} station's passenger facilities, {{as well as an}} appropriate architectural frontispiece to the street. This arrangement was very similar to that put in place at Charing Cross. The hotel was not profitable, and was over £47,000 (now £) in debt by 1870. The City Terminus Hotel was renamed the Cannon Street Hotel in 1879. In July 1920, the hotel was the first meeting point of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Most of the hotel was closed in 1931, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> rooms were kept open for meetings. The rest were converted into offices and renamed Southern House.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Snow Hill tunnel re-opened and {{the former}} LCDR City Branch {{formed the basis of}} the new Thameslink route. Network Rail began a major upgrade of the route in 2009. A key {{objective}} of the Thameslink Programme was allowing more trains to travel between central London and Brighton, which was prevented by a bottleneck between London Bridge and Blackfriars on a viaduct through the historic Borough Market. Network Rail initially suggested widening the viaduct and demolishing part of the market, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> backlash against this plan prompted Network Rail to consider permanently routing all Thameslink trains to/from Brighton via Herne Hill, avoiding London Bridge and the market. This would have required the grade separation of the two lines through Herne Hill, which would have been achieved by constructing a new viaduct immediately to the east of the existing viaduct and using a fly-over to connect {{the southern end of the}} new viaduct to the line between Tulse Hill and North Dulwich (taking the tracks over the Chatham Main Line and towards Tulse Hill). This proposal was rejected in 2004 because of its environmental impact on Herne Hill and the larger number of interchanges offered on the London Bridge route; the Borough Market viaduct was widened instead. From December 2008 to May 2012, Thameslink trains serving Herne Hill did not run most weekends or after 22:30 every week-night because of construction work on the Thameslink route through central London as part of the Thameslink Programme.|$|E

25|$|The Astor Library {{suffered}} from its name. There was actually no proprietorship, and {{no question of}} family fiefdom.

50|$|In the 1980s, New Zealand {{education}} underwent more major reforms. Early in the decade, {{the government}} {{called for a}} review of the curriculum.

25|$|Labor representatives {{believed}} that wage controls were particularly unfair to some workers. Some workers had received very high wage increases in 1950 {{prior to the}} imposition of wage controls, while others had yet to negotiate contracts or receive wage increases. Labor representatives demanded a 12 percent wage increase for workers {{who had not yet}} negotiated contracts under the wage stabilization policy, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and corporate members of the board held to a 10 percent increase.|$|E
25|$|Civil courts {{exist for}} {{lawsuits}} and other disputes, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> widely viewed them as corrupt. Magistrates were poorly paid, {{and the party}} willing to pay them the most money was generally believed to receive decisions in its favor. Most individuals could not afford the often prohibitive fees associated with filing a civil case. No civil court exists to address human rights violations. Military courts had effective jurisdiction over most human rights violations, since government security forces were the primary violators.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{the complex}} was preceded by a seven-year zoning and legal battle {{over the future of}} the Georgetown waterfront. This dispute led to the {{designation}} and development of a new national park, the Georgetown Waterfront Park. A two-year controversy over the design {{of the complex}}, which included accusations of malfeasance by a D.C. agency, followed. Construction began in November 1981, and was complete in June 1986. Critical reception of Washington Harbour was mixed, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> quickly embraced it.|$|E

25|$|In 1911, seven coal {{companies}} in Westmoreland County and Allegheny County sued {{the leaders of}} the strike. The coal companies claimed they had suffered economic losses as high as $500,000 due to the strike and strike-related property damage. Twenty-eight officers in nearby District 5 and 17 strike leaders in Westmoreland County were arrested on charges of conspiracy, intimidation, violence and general lawlessness. Local labor unions helped the 45 men post bond of $300 each, and instituted a special per capita assessment to form a legal defense fund. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> outcry was so extraordinary that the coal companies dropped the suits.|$|E
25|$|Boniface II {{attempted}} to re-entrench {{the practice of}} appointing his successor, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> outcry was too great, resulting in a highly disputed election in 532 characterized by widespread accounts of bribery and coercion, which resulted in Pope John II (the first to take a papal name). Athalaric, the Ostrogoth king, forced John II to approve decrees that banned any private agreements to elect a pope and enacting limits {{on the amount of}} money that could be spent during a papal election (an early example of campaign finance reform). In fact, Athalaric himself was able to engineer the election of Pope Silverius, the son of Pope Hormisdas, upon John II's death.|$|E

25|$|Street demonstrations {{are rare}} in Malaysia, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> {{has become more}} vocal {{with the rise of}} {{alternative}} media and a resurgent opposition. Gatherings in Malaysia of five or more people must receive a police permit, which is rarely granted. The government has used heavy police presence to block rallies as well as arrest protest leaders to stop illegal public protests. Former prime minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said he was willing to sacrifice public freedoms in the interest of national stability. Four rallies in 2007 ended with arrests made by police. A protest in 2009 against the Internal Security Act was also broken up by tear gas and water cannons.|$|E
25|$|At the 1993 Indianapolis 500, winner Emerson Fittipaldi, {{who owned}} and {{operated}} an orange grove, notoriously drank orange juice instead of milk during the televised winner's interview. He eventually relented and also drank from the milk bottle later in the post-race ceremonies after the broadcast was over, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> relations damage had already been done. The snub led to Fittipaldi being booed at the next ChampCar race, the Milwaukee Mile, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the heart of dairy country, and by some, {{as late as the}} 2008 Indianapolis 500 in which he drove the pace car. In the 2016 Indianapolis 500, as a promotion, the track gave out commemorative bottles of milk to 100,000 attendees to toast the winner with milk after the race.|$|E
25|$|CSEA {{challenged}} the SEIU/AFT coalition's victory, however. CSEA attorneys alleged that nearly 5,000 of the signatures on the petition forcing an election were fraudulent. A New York Supreme Court (the state's trial court of general jurisdiction) initially dismissed the suit, {{but it was}} reinstated by a state appellate court. As the lawsuit progressed, CSEA won a new three-year contract which included a 7 percent pay hike in the first year. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>Public</b> Employees Federation ultimately prevailed in the New York Court of Appeals (the highest court {{in the state of}} New York) on March 28, 1979. PEF subsequently negotiated a controversial contract which gave union members a 36 percent pay increase over three years. Submitted to the members without the approval of PEF's executive council, the contract was overwhelmingly approved by PEF members on December 6, 1979.|$|E

25|$|The 1975 season saw the {{introduction}} of the Astros' new uniforms. Many teams were going away from the traditional uniform and the Astros were no exception. The uniforms had multishade stripes of orange, red and yellow in front and in back behind a large dark blue star over the midsection. The same stripes ran down the pant legs. Players numbers not only appeared {{on the back of the}} jersey, but also on the pant leg. The bright stripes were meant to appear as a fiery trail like a rocket sweeping across the heavens. The uniforms were panned by critics, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> liked them and versions started appearing at the high school and little league level. The uniform was so different from what other teams wore that the Astros wore it both at home and on the road until 1980.|$|E
25|$|One of the town's most {{well-known}} shops, the shoe store Tommy Ball's, closed in May 2008 after going into administration. The town's oldest store, Mercer & Sons, also closed after {{a decline in}} sales blamed on the credit crunch. It opened in 1840 and was originally an ironmonger <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> store converted to selling toys, household goods and hardware. However, in January 2009 {{the directors of the}} company announced that the shop would close following a 30-day statutory consultation, unless they change their mind or a buyer is found. The markets continue to offer a wide range of local produce—Lancashire cheeses, tripe, Bowland beef and lamb can all be found. Walsh's Sarsaparilla stall decided not to move into the new market development. The market moved into the Mall shopping centre in 2011, and now opens 6 days a week (closed on bank holidays).|$|E
25|$|As the Baroque style {{went out}} of fashion during the 18th century, the {{majority}} of Baroque and pre-Baroque composers were virtually forgotten. Local organists in Nuremberg and Erfurt knew Pachelbel's music and occasionally performed it, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> {{and the majority of}} composers and performers did not pay much attention to Pachelbel and his contemporaries. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, some organ works by Pachelbel were published and several musicologists started considering him an important composer, particularly Philipp Spitta, who was one of the first researchers to trace Pachelbel's role in the development of Baroque keyboard music. Much of Pachelbel's work was published in the early 20th century in the Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich series, but it was not until the rise of interest in early Baroque music in the middle of the 20th century and the advent of historically-informed performance practice and associated research that Pachelbel's works began to be studied extensively and again performed more frequently.|$|E
