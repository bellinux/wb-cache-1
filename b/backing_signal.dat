Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which can modulate {{the release of a}} rich array of neurotransmitters, are differentially targeted to presynaptic sites. We demonstrate that Type III Nrg 1 <b>back</b> <b>signaling</b> regulates the surface expression of α 7 nAChRs along axons of sensory neurons. Stimulation of Type III Nrg 1 <b>back</b> <b>signaling</b> induces an increase in axonal surface α 7 nAChRs, which results from a redistribution of preexisting intracellular pools of α 7 rather than from increased protein synthesis. We also demonstrate that Type III Nrg 1 <b>back</b> <b>signaling</b> activates a phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase signaling pathway and that activation of this pathway is required for the insertion of preexisting α 7 nAChRs into the axonal plasma membrane. These findings, in conjunction with prior results establishing that Type III Nrg 1 <b>back</b> <b>signaling</b> controls gene transcription, demonstrate that Type III Nrg 1 <b>back</b> <b>signaling</b> can regulate both short-and long-term changes in neuronal function...|$|R

40|$|The drying {{behaviour}} {{of freshly}} prepared anhydrite screed and cement screed samples was investigated non-destructively and in contact-free way using ultra-wideband microwave signals {{in the frequency}} range between about 1 GHz and 10 GHz. The measurements have been performed using a vector network analyser and air-coupled wideband horn antennas in reflection mode. Both entry echo and back wall echo at the interfaces of the samples were analysed. The amplitudes of the entry signals decreased within few weeks as the real part of the relative permittivity decreased with drying. Finally a plateau level was reached. At {{the beginning of the}} tests the <b>back</b> wall <b>signal</b> of the specimen was not recognizable since the attenuation of the microwaves resp. the imaginary part of the permittivity in the moist sample was too high. After a few weeks of drying, a <b>back</b> wall <b>signal</b> was detected. It increased with continued desiccation and thus lowered attenuation, until here again a constant level was reached. At the same time, the temporal position of the <b>back</b> wall <b>signal</b> moved to smaller times since the propagation velocity of the microwaves increased until a constant value was reached as well...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Current {{broadband}} wireless networks {{are characterized by}} large cell sizes. Yet, even in advanced networks, users on the cell edge will face relatively low Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR). An attractive solution for this problem is provided by multi-hop technologies. In this paper, we consider the performance of full duplex Amplify-and-Forward (AF) and half duplex Decode–and-Forward (DF) Relay Nodes (RNs) from 3 G LTE-Advanced perspective. The comparison between AF and DF relaying is important because both approaches are currently under consideration in LTE-Advanced study item in 3 GPP. Performance evaluation considers AF RN loop <b>back</b> <b>signal</b> interference and concurrent DF RN transmissions on the access link.
