60|$|Captain Boldwig was {{a little}} fierce man in a stiff black neckerchief and blue surtout, who, when he did condescend to walk about his property, did it in company with a thick rattan stick with a <b>brass</b> <b>ferrule,</b> and a {{gardener}} and sub-gardener with meek faces, to whom (the gardeners, not the stick) Captain Boldwig gave his orders with all due grandeur and ferocity; for Captain Boldwig's wife's sister had married a marquis, and the captain's house was a villa, and his land 'grounds,' {{and it was all}} very high, and mighty, and great.|$|E
50|$|Tuckpointing tools have {{a wooden}} handle which is {{attached}} with a <b>brass</b> <b>ferrule.</b>|$|E
50|$|The hilts {{are very}} varied, but all {{can be reduced}} to an animal's head or mouth, {{most of the time the}} lasara (mythical creature), made in a plain stylized way or in a complex, richly {{decorated}} form. Most of this hilts are made from wood, but brass ones do occur. Wooden hilts have <b>brass</b> <b>ferrule</b> broadening towards the blade.|$|E
60|$|This man, {{besides being}} {{possessed of a}} superabundance of supercilious impudence, also possessed a set of digging tools, the handles of which were made of {{polished}} oak and walnut, with bright <b>brass</b> <b>ferrules.</b> With these he proposed to dig his fortune in a leisurely way; meanwhile, finding the weather rather hot, he had {{made up his mind}} to have his portrait done.|$|R
5000|$|... "Chilli on the stick" [...] - Analogous to {{the saying}} [...] "rubbing {{salt in the}} wound", [...] "chilli on the stick" [...] is {{referred}} to by Roy and HG when a team already trailing on the scoreboard is further humiliated by the opposition scoring subsequent tries. Roy and HG metaphorically refer to the winning team grabbing a cricket stump, removing the <b>brass</b> <b>ferrules,</b> then applying chilli and inserting it [...] "in, out, in, out" [...] of the losing team's date (a slang word for anus).|$|R
50|$|Brother George O'Donnell of Shaker Village in New Lebanon, New York {{came up with}} {{a strong}} metal {{attachment}} device in 1852. It replaced the wooden ball bearing that was inserted into the wooden legs and secured with a leather strap. The metal ball-bearing mechanism was patented by him. It consisted of <b>brass</b> <b>ferrules</b> and balls. It was a practical strong metal attachment to the back two legs of wooden chairs to allow the sitter to tilt back without gouging the floor. A version of O'Donnell's tilt device is still being used on chairs in the twenty-first century.|$|R
5000|$|Nipples {{are also}} {{available}} separately from the cable, for purposes of repair or custom cable construction. They are fitted to the cable by soldering. Where free rotation of nipples, relative to the cable axis is required, the cable end may be finished with a <b>brass</b> <b>ferrule</b> or [...] "trumpet" [...] soldered to the cable. The barrel nipple will be a sliding fit over the <b>brass</b> <b>ferrule,</b> and can thus rotate, to ensure alignment of the nipples {{at each end of}} the cable, and avoidance of twisting of the inner cable. Applying heat to the inner cable for soldering may weaken the steel, and although soft soldering is less strong than silver solder, a lower temperature is required to form the joint, and there is less likelihood of the inner cable being damaged as a result. Silver soldering may require additional heat treatment of the wire to preserve the temper of it in order to prevent it from becoming too soft or too brittle ...|$|E
40|$|Pencil Works # 00 - # 09 A {{celebration of}} one of the most {{ubiquitous}} everyday tools. This series of “pencil works” is inspired by the many secondary uses that people sometimes put these simple little devices to and focuses on developing a range of products that build real secondary functions by way of additional components. Taking visual cues from classic woodworking tools, each simple pencil is fitted with a threaded <b>brass</b> <b>ferrule</b> that accepts a tool from the series – cut, file, measure or mark...|$|E
40|$|Kenward et al. (2001) observed: ‘‘Techniques for {{studying}} animals should not prejudice either {{the welfare of}} the individuals or the scientific quality of the results. This is especially important when advances in technology create new opportunities, as well as new risks. ’’ Satellite telemetry technology has revolutionized the ability of scientists to conduct long-term studies of avian movements and behavior (e. g., Prince et al. 1992, Cappelle et al. 2011, Chevallier et al. 2011). Effective application of this technology depends on many factors, including the proper attachment of the transmitter to the bird. For large birds, transmitters are attached using a backpack-style harness to position the transmitter snugly {{on the back of the}} bird (e. g., Dunstan 1972, Buehler et al. 1995). The harness is then secured by sewing, gluing, or crimping <b>brass</b> <b>ferrules</b> around the leads of the harness, the exact methods depending upon the preferences of the investigator. In previous telemetry studies with vultures, we found that properly fitting and securing the harness by sewing, gluing, and crimping was sometimes difficult and stressful to the bird as well as to the investigator. So, to help prevent transmitter loss, obtain a proper fit, and expedite the attachment procedure, we developed and tested a new method that is quicker, easier, and inexpensive to apply, and that improves the security of the harness for long-term satellite telemetry studies (Avery et al. 2011) ...|$|R
5000|$|In small sizes, the {{compression}} fitting {{is composed of}} an outer compression nut and an inner compression ring or ferrule (sometimes referred to as an [...] "olive") that is typically made of <b>brass</b> or copper. <b>Ferrules</b> vary in shape and material but are most commonly {{in the shape of}} a ring with beveled edges. To work properly, the ferrule must be oriented correctly—usually the ferrule is fitted such that the longest sloping face of the ferrule faces away from the nut.|$|R
