40|$|The use of {{renewable}} energy sources is increasing due to national and international regulations. Such energy sources are less predictable {{than most of the}} classical energy production systems, like coal and nuclear power plants. This causes a challenge for balancing the electricity system. A possibility to meet this challenge is to use the flexibility in electricity demand for balancing with unpredictable electricity supply. In this paper, we introduce a model for flexibility in electricity demand and supply and give some examples of flexibility models for existing devices. In addition, we describe the business advantages for using flexibility and some pricing mechanisms that provide financial incentives for using flexibility by the consumer and the <b>balance</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>party</b> in the grid...|$|E

We investigate the impact of the imbalance settlement design on the behaviour of <b>Balance</b> <b>Responsible</b> <b>Parties</b> and thereby on balancing market performance by means of a comparison of the German and Dutch imbalance settlement designs and balancing market results for the period May-December 2009. It is found that Germany has much higher activated balancing energy volumes, imbalance prices and actual BRP cost levels than the Netherlands, but these differences are perhaps rather caused by balancing energy market design differences and differences in intermittent generation shares than by imbalance settlement design differences. The real-time publication of balance regulation in the Netherlands enables internal balancing by BRPs, which may reduce the size of system imbalances. Generally, BRPs will over-contract a little, because of the lower risk of having a negative individual imbalance and because of the evening out of imbalance costs over a longer time period.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we study}} a three-level {{hierarchical}} control framework for integration of industrial consumers {{to the future}} smart grid. With this structure, a <b>balance</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>party</b> (BRP) at the top level {{will be able to}} provide regulating power from the consumer side to help the power grid in case there is imbalance between demand and supply. We consider heterogeneous consumers at the bottom level, namely a cold storage in supermarkets and a chiller equipped with ice storage. These consumers are under the direct control of a mid-level controller, a so-called aggregator. The aggregator receives a certain amount of power reference within a certain activation time from BRP and applies a model predictive controller (MPC) approach to split up the power reference between different consumers in an optimal way. Each consumer has its own characteristics and constraints that should be honored by the aggregator. I...|$|E
40|$|Intelligent IT-based solutions, {{often called}} Smart Grids, are {{considered}} to be the future balancers of renewable energy sources. One area within the Smart Grid concept is called demand response, which is focused on making customers more consumption flexible by making them more active in their consumption. In this thesis the aim is to analyze a business model by investigating the income potential for a demand response solution as well as its market potential. This has been done through literature studies, interviews and development of a computational model. The use of 5000 households with flexible consumption can provide a cost reduction of 17. 2 % or 2. 4 million SEK for a <b>balance</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>party</b> during an average year. If the solution is used to make strategic bids on the regulation markets the study indicates that the largest potential for revenues lies within this strategy. Potential customers show a genuine interest in the solution, but are worried about implementation costs, product reliability and contract solutions. The business model needs further development to increase its reliability. The impact of using strategic bids optimally needs to be investigated, and a thorough market analysis would be of great help to answer the questions: how should tomorrow’s contracts look like and which actors will be present on tomorrow’s electricity market...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{flexible}} optimization method, based on {{state of the}} art algorithms, for the smart control of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) to balance wind power production. The problem is approached {{from the perspective of a}} <b>balance</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>party</b> (BRP) with a large share of wind power in its portfolio. The BRP uses controllable PHEVs to minimize the imbalance of its portfolio resulting from wind power forecast errors. A Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation in combination with dynamic programming is used to solve the multistage stochastic problem. The main difficulty for applying MDPs to this problem is to efficiently include time interdependence of the wind power forecast error. In the presented approach, the probability distribution and time interdependence of the forecast error are represented by a scenario tree. Because of the MDP formulation, the algorithm is adaptable to deal with different transition models and constraints. This feature enables to use the algorithm in a dynamic environment such as the future smart grid. To demonstrate this, a generic charging model for PHEVs is used in the BRP wind balancing case. The flexibility of the algorithm is shown by investigating the solution for different degrees of complexity in the charging model. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePURPOSE-To {{foster the}} grid {{integration}} of both electric vehicles (EV) and renewable generators, this paper investigates the possible synergies between these players {{so as to}} jointly improve the production predictability while ensuring a green mobility. It is here achieved by the mean of a grid commitment over the overall power produced by a collaborative system which here gathers a PV plant with an EV fleet. The scope of the present contribution is to investigate the conditions {{to make the most}} of such an association, mainly regarding to the management strategies and optimal sizing, taking into account forecast errors on PV production. METHODOLOGY-To evaluate the collaboration added value, several concerns are aggregated into a primary energy criterion: the commitment compliance, the power spillage, the vehicle charging, the user mobility and the battery aging. Variations of these costs are computed over a range of EV fleet size. Moreover, the influence of the charging strategy is specifically investigated throughout the comparison of three managements: a simple rule of thumb, a perfect knowledge deterministic case and a charging strategy computed by stochastic dynamic programming. The latter is based on an original modeling of the production forecast error. This methodology is carried out to assess the collaboration added value for two operators points of view: a virtual power plant (VPP) and a <b>balance</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>party</b> (BRP). FINDINGS-From the perspective of a BRP, the added value of PV-EV collaboration for the energy system has been evidenced in any situation even when the charging strategy is very simple. On the other hand, for the case of a VPP operator, the coupling between the optimal sizing and and the management strategy is highlighted. ORIGINALITY-A co-optimization of the sizing and the management of a PV-EV collaborative system is introduced and the influence of the management strategy on the collaboration added value has been investigated. This gave rise to the presentation and implementation of an original modeling tool of the PV production forecast error.

40|$|In any {{electrical}} power system, there {{must always be}} a balance between generation and load of electricity. Any imbalance will instantaneously be compensated by a change in kinetic energy of rotating generators and motors. Therefore, any imbalance results in a frequency deviation from the nominal frequency. To ensure a reliable supply of electricity, frequency deviations must always be within limits. The balance between generation and load is maintained using control and reserve capacity that can be activated within a specified amount of time. Usually units with low marginal costs are used for base load production, while units with high marginal costs and flexible loads are used for control and reserve purposes. To ensure the balance of generation and load, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) {{has set up a}} number of policies that describe what the individual control areas should do in case of any frequency deviation. In these policies, different control mechanisms are mentioned that should act in different time frames. These mechanisms are primary, secondary, tertiary and time control as well as scheduling and accounting. Besides the policies on ENTSO-E level, there is also regulation on a national level. In the Netherlands, balance keeping is based on a system of balance responsibility. A <b>balance</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>party</b> represents one or more producers or consumers and is responsible for delivering or consuming an exact amount of energy per time frame as stated beforehand. Any deviation from this will be penalised and balancing power for balance settlement is traded on a single sided market with the transmission system operator (TSO). The opinions of involved stakeholders on the existing regulatory framework, ensuring the provision of enough balancing capacity for primary and secondary control, are gathered and discussed. Future power systems are considered to contain much more distributed and renewable generation. This will inevitably lead to higher numbers of intermittent generators. This results in a higher complexity to match generation and load because of less predictability and larger variations in time. Different organisational structures have been mentioned in literature to cope with the higher complexity of future power systems. One of these ideas is based on autonomous networks which can be considered as aggregations of producers and consumers on both a physical and a business level. Agents, representing the autonomous networks, are able to trade both energy as well as ancillary services for balance management...|$|E

These incentives are evaluated using historical data from the Swiss power system which features a typical European imbalance pricing mechanism. The results imply that little effort would have been needed to make a good profit at the expense of system security. The major loophole arises from the interdependence between cross-border trading and national imbalance energy pricing.

40|$|The Flemish project Linear was a {{large scale}} {{residential}} demand response pilot that aims to validate innovative smart grid technology building on the rollout of {{information and communication technologies}} in the power grid.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a market design for trading {{capacity}} reserves (also called Ancillary Services, AS) and to introduce a strategy for the optimal bidding problem in such a scenario. In the deregulated market, the presence of several market participants or <b>Balance</b> <b>Responsible</b> <b>Parties</b> (BRPs) entitled for trading energy, together with the increasing integration of renewable sources and price-elastic loads, shift the focus on decentralized control and reliable forecast techniques. The main feature of the considered market design is its double-sided nature. In addition to portfolio-based supply bids and based on prediction of their stochastic production and load, BRPs are allowed to submit risk-limiting requests. Requesting capacity from the AS market corresponds to giving to the market an estimate of the possible deviation from the daily production schedule resulting from the day-ahead auction and from bilateral contracts, named E-Program.

40|$|The {{imbalance}} settlement design {{is the part}} of an electricity balancing market design that stimulates so-called <b>Balance</b> <b>Responsible</b> <b>Parties</b> (BRPs) to <b>balance</b> their electricity production and consumption portfolio and to stick to their energy schedules by penalizing any deviations from these schedules with an imbalance price. There are numerous {{imbalance settlement}} design options, each of which gives different incentives to BRPs. The aim of this work is to analyze the impact of the imbalance settlement design on BRP behaviour, and thereby on balancing market performance. For this purpose an agent based model has been built, in which the BRPs are the agents that decide autonomously in each round on their balancing strategy based on results in past rounds. Six alternative imbalance settlement designs are analyzed. We conclude from the analysis results that it is generally a better strategy for BRPs to opt for a long position rather than a short position, and to opt for a small imbalance rather than a large one. Furthermore, different imbalance settlement designs will lead to different but still similar results, because of the balancing market equilibrium that emerges {{as a result of the}} dynamic feedback loop between BRP behaviour and balancing market outcomes. An exception is formed by two-price settlement, which leads to much higher imbalance costs. Finally, it was found that the imbalance costs for large BRPs are relatively higher, and that the choice of imbalance settlement design has a greater impact on the behaviour of small BRPs.

40|$|This thesis proposes and evaluates a {{local market}} design for reserve energy in which private {{households}} can trade their self-generated energy. The market conceptualization builds upon {{the idea of}} a microgrid connecting households with and without power generation equipment.

Such a mechanism helps to better integrate distributed generation and acts as an alternative incentive scheme once the fixed feed-in tariffs are abandoned. The market has some definite characteristics that result from the specific technologies and their users. The predominant attribute is the involvement of private households, i. e. retail customers – now in the role of producer-consumers (“prosumers”) – without much expertise in the field of energy trading. Hence, trading rules need to be simplistic to create something like an “energy-eBay".

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is twofold. First, for a rather broad class of {{financial}} options a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) approach is proposed for dynamically hedging a portfolio of underlying assets. After formulating the dynamic hedging problem as a stochastic control problem with a least-squares criterion, for plain vanilla and exotic options we test its ability to replicate the payoff at expiration date. We show not only that relatively small hedging errors are obtained in spite of price realizations, but also that the approach is robust with respect to market modeling errors. The SMPC approach is then extended to hedging derivative contracts (such as plain vanilla and exotic options) {{in the presence of}} transaction costs. After proving that the least-squares approach is no longer suitable to handle this kind of market, the hedging performance obtained by three different measures is tested and compared in simulation on a European call and a barrier option. The aim {{in the second part of}} this thesis is to present a novel market design for trading energy and regulating reserves and to introduce a strategy for the optimal bidding problem in such a scenario. In the deregulated market, the presence of several market participants or <b>Balance</b> <b>Responsible</b> <b>Parties</b> (BRPs) entitled for trading energy, together with the increasing integration of renewable sources and price-elastic loads, shift the focus on decentralized control and reliable forecast techniques.

40|$|Power {{generation}} mix of {{each country}} depends mainly {{on the availability of}} usable resources in its territory or the possibility of importing them. In connection with the fulfilment of ambitious objectives to be reached by 2020 power generation mix is changing rapidly and is heading toward low carbon electricity generation footprint. Power generation mix in individual countries is more and more affected by their geographical location and its potential for utilization of renewables. In the beginning of year 2016 OTC electricity prices for 2017 base-load delivery in Germany were attacking 20 EUR level while half a year ago it was traded for 30 EUR. [37] Subsidized renewables caused price curve distortion resulting in conventional hard coal and lignite power plants that accounted in 2015 for 42 % of total electricity generation, to operate close to their variable costs. Share of Germany’s electricity generation from renewables reached in 2015 30 % and still new projects are planned or already under construction. [13] Low prices are not only affecting electricity markets where renewables are installed but also adjacent electricity markets in the neighbouring countries that are well-interconnected. With increasing renewable power capacity serious problems are experienced in the whole meshed central European network that may eventually lead to blackout situations. For electricity market participants with renewables in their generation portfolio is crucial to have all possible means to stay balanced. Interconnected electricity markets with high liquidity covering every day 24 hours and offering short-term products that can be traded {{as close as possible to}} delivery have to be on place. In case of missing trading platform, low liquidity or long time lag between delivery and product trading deadline, market participants are unable to balance themselves and are consequently exposed to balancing costs that can account for big part of total costs endangering profitability. In any case <b>balance</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>parties</b> have to do everything to be balanced. In my thesis I am testing possibility of using neural networks to improve generation forecast for wind farm from three independent meteorological data providers.

40|$|Allocation of {{environmental}} cleanup costs among <b>responsible</b> <b>parties</b> {{is a key}} component of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as Superfund. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has expressly acknowledged its importance and twice within the past three terms has grappled with how <b>responsible</b> <b>parties</b> may bring CERCLA claims, for contribution or otherwise, to force other <b>responsible</b> <b>parties</b> to share responsibility for cleanup costs at contaminated sites. While some questions remain to be answered around the edges, it is once again fairly clear that a <b>responsible</b> <b>party</b> who is subject to joint and several liability for cleanup costs has a statutory claim under CERCLA by which he can require other <b>responsible</b> <b>parties</b> to bear their equitable shares of the cleanup burden. Thus, because a CERCLA defendant can bring actions for contribution or cost recovery, he may not have to shoulder the entire cleanup burden himself, while other <b>responsible</b> <b>parties</b> avoid liability entirely, just because he had the misfortune of being the one <b>responsible</b> <b>party</b> sued. In addition to providing a whiff of fairness in the Superfund program, the availability of contribution and cost recovery claims by <b>responsible</b> <b>parties</b> is widely credited with promoting settlements and encouraging cleanups of contaminated sites by private parties while preserving governmental resources.
