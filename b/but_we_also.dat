5|$|That day we saw horror, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>also</b> saw quiet acts of courage. We {{saw this}} courage in a teacher named Liviu Librescu. With the gunman set to enter his class, this brave {{professor}} blocked {{the door with}} his body while his students fled to safety. On the Day of Remembrance, this Holocaust survivor gave his own life so that others may live. And this morning we honor his memory and we take strength from his example.|$|E
25|$|Now, if we're given a {{vector field}} Y over M (but not the {{principal}} bundle) <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>also</b> have a connection over the principal bundle, we can define a vector field X over the principal bundle such that its horizontal component matches Y and its vertical component {{agrees with the}} connection. This is the covariant Lie derivative.|$|E
25|$|Suppose that a Brownian {{particle}} of mass M {{is surrounded}} by lighter particles of mass m which are traveling at a speed u. Then, reasons Smoluchowski, in any collision between a surrounding and Brownian particles, the velocity transmitted to the latter will be mu/M. This ratio is {{of the order of}} 10−7cm/s. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>also</b> have to take into consideration that in a gas there will be more than 1016 collisions in a second, and even greater in a liquid where we expect that there will be 1020 collision in one second. Some of these collisions will tend to accelerate the Brownian particle; others will tend to decelerate it. If there is a mean excess of one kind of collision or the other to be of the order of 108 to 1010 collisions in one second, then velocity of the Brownian particle may be anywhere between 10 and 1000cm/s. Thus, even though there are equal probabilities for forward and backward collisions there will be a net tendency to keep the Brownian particle in motion, just as the ballot theorem predicts.|$|E

500|$|... "It's a SpongeBob Christmas!" [...] was {{the first}} {{full-length}} episode of the series to be produced in stop motion animation. Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh, and Christopher Finnegan animated it at Screen Novelties, while Caballero and Walsh served as the directors. Screen Novelties was chosen by the show's executives to execute the animation because they had already worked with them before in other several smaller projects. These include the revamping of the opening title sequence of the show for 2009's SpongeBob's Truth or Square. Walsh explained, [...] "They dug one of our shorts that we'd done a while back, which was called Graveyard Jamboree with Mysterious Mose, and wanted to have us apply our sensibilities to SpongeBob ...

When the initial game concept was conceived, the location of Iran had not been decided; the development team was attracted to the idea of a game set during a revolution, ultimately settling on the Iranian Revolution. When representing the concept of a revolution, the development team wished to demonstrate the multiple definitions of the term. Khonsari stated that they [...] "wanted to embrace that spirit of revolution, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>also</b> show the trajectory of a revolution", regarding the true negative and complicated results of real revolutions.|$|E

Bennet stated, [...] "The comic book version of Daisy Johnson has very short, Miley Cyrus-esque hair. We wanted to stay true to the comic book character fans love; I wanted to please them but also make sure there was still some movement and length and sexiness in the hair." [...] Bennet also received a new costume for the season, along with Quake's signature gauntlets. On the costume, Foley said, [...] "It's about strength. She feels very empowered in it....I wanted to stay true to some of the designs I saw in the comics. In the style lines, I wanted to pay {{a little bit of a}} tribute to [...] tactical ability from last season, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>also</b> incorporated the Quake symbol into her gauntlets and on the back of her suit."

500|$|On February 21, 2014, Mayor Harpole {{spoke about}} the refugee {{population}} in Amarillo. According to 2007-2012 State Department data from U.S. Representative Mac Thornberry, Amarillo received {{the highest number of}} refugees per capita than any other Texas city. According to Harpole, the city has struggled with accommodating a high number of foreign language speakers in areas like education and 911 response. Harpole told the Texas Tribune, [...] "We’ve raised some red flags and said this isn’t good for some entities in the city or for the refugees themselves". Many refugees worked in meatpacking plants in the area, but Harpole expressed concern that jobs were declining and believed [...] "it’s going to be more difficult for the refugees to do well" [...] in Amarillo. After requests from Harpole, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission agreed with various refugee resettlement organizations in late 2013 that new placements in Amarillo would be limited to family reunification. However, Harpole wished to make clear, [...] "We don’t want to get the idea out that we are not supportive of refugees. We’ve been very accepting. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>also</b> need to keep it in a ratio that's healthy for the refugees as well as the residents".|$|E

The league had criticized The Simpsons depiction of Catholicism before, namely in the episode [...] "Lisa Gets an [...] "A"", which aired the year before. The scene included an exchange between Bart and Marge that the League felt was hurtful to Catholics. William A. Donohue, {{the president of the}} league, wrote Fox a letter asking them to explain why the dialogue was in the show. After failing to receive an answer several times, Donohue was at last given a reply written by Thomas Chavez, manager for broadcast standards and practices. The league were not satisfied with Chavez' answer. After [...] "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday" [...] aired, the Catholic League issued an article in their news magazine Catalyst. In it, they mentioned the scene in [...] "Lisa Gets an [...] "A"", and wrote that The Simpsons had [...] "struck again, big time" [...] with the Super Bowl commercial in [...] "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday". They wrote that they had sent a complaint to Chavez regarding the scene, and encouraged others to do the same; [...] "We wrote to Mr. Chavez again, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>also</b> told him that he’d be hearing from you, too.

500|$|At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Spears said to MTV News {{that she}} had thought of a [...] "really cool concept for the video, just to make it interesting. You'll have to see." [...] She then {{contacted}} Chris Marrs Piliero, who directed the music video for her previous single [...] "I Wanna Go", to work with her. She told him the basic story she had planned, which he described as a [...] "fairy-tale, sweet, knight-in-shining-armor feel to it. I said let's take that and make the fairy tale badass." [...] Spears also wanted her real-life boyfriend Jason Trawick to play the criminal. Marrs Piliero was initially hesitant to cast Trawick feeling that a professional actor would do a better job, but did not talk to Spears about it. He told USA Today, [...] "When you're doing nudity, I don't think {{it was at the}} top of Britney's list to bring in some random guy while her boyfriend watches. [...] We definitely wanted to make some passionate, steamy scenes, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>also</b> wanted it to be intensely beautiful. We didn't want to go for raunchy. We wanted it to be sensual and steamy." [...] On September 6, 2011, Spears announced through her Twitter account {{that she had}} decided to shoot the video [...] "in the streets of merry old England when I get there." [...] In an interview with AOL, she explained, [...] "I've never shot on location out of the country of America for a video. So, it should be very interesting.

500|$|Before {{the renewal}} of the fifth season, Abrams stated some {{skepticism}} for a renewal opportunity, but hoped {{that if it was}} cancelled, that it may be picked up by another network. On the other hand, Abrams considered that if Fox did pick up the show for a fifth season, [...] "the next year would be the great ending for the show". Similarly, Fox's Reilly remained cautious about a renewal, noting that while the show {{is one of the top}} shows in the Friday night slot, [...] "it's an expensive show. We lose a lot of money on the show." [...] Reilly further reiterated the dedication of the fans of the show for helping it to its fourth season and continued success. When asked about whether the writers would have enough notice to write the fourth-season finale as a series finale if necessary, Reilly stated, [...] "That's a Peter Roth issue" [...] (chief executive of Warner Bros. Television). To which Roth responded, [...] "We have no plans to give viewers closure this season because we expect the series to continue". In late January 2012, Fox and Warner Bros. Television were working on negotiating a lower licensing cost for the show to allow a fifth season to occur; this would not only help Fox reduce its losses on the show, but would also bring the total number of episodes above 100, giving Warner Bros. a better opportunity to syndicate reruns of the show. Before the announcement of the fifth season, Wyman and Pinkner stated that they would have created a series finale for the end of the fourth season should the show be cancelled; Wyman stated [...] "We want to take care of the fans. We want them to see where it would have gone, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>also</b> know the show has been a commitment and we want everyone to be satisfied with it." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2007, the Prime Minister's {{annual salary}} {{increased}} to S$3.1 million (US$2.05 million), {{about five times}} that of the then President of the United States George W. Bush who earned US$400,000. The annual entry-level salary for ministers increased from $1.2 million to $1.6 million, and was projected to rise to 88% of the private sector benchmark by the end of 2008. Almost half of ministers' pay packages was made up of an individual performance bonus decided by the Prime Minister, and a variable bonus component based on the country's prevailing gross domestic product and capped at eight months of each minister's annual salary. The pay increases were justified by the Government {{on the grounds that the}} salaries had to keep pace with those in the private sector to attract the best talent and to avoid corruption. Teo Chee Hean, the Minister for Defence and minister in charge of the civil service, was reported as saying: [...] "We don't want pay to be the reason for people to join [...] <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>also</b> don't want pay to be the reason for them not to join us, or to leave after joining us." [...] The increases sparked much debate both in and out of Parliament, with many people seeing ministerial pay as already being too high. During a Parliamentary debate on the issue, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann said: [...] "It would be a sad indictment of my generation if no one came forward to serve without excessive monetary inducement, as to be bereft of deep convictions is to be impoverished indeed." [...] On 11 April 2007, the Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Parliament: [...] "To make it quite clear why I am doing this, and also to give me the moral standing to defend this policy with Singaporeans, I will hold my own salary at the present level for five years. The government will pay me my full salary, because that is the way the system will have to work, but for five years, whatever the increase in the salary above its present level, I will donate to suitable good causes." [...] The following day, it was clarified that the Prime Minister had decided to do so a while ago, and that he had not been influenced by pressure arising from the announcement of the ministerial pay rise.|$|E
