50|$|The common {{friction}} tube is {{a copper}} tube, packed with powder, having {{at the upper}} end a short branch (called a nib piece) at right angles. This branch is filled with friction composition in which a friction bar is embedded. When the friction bar is sharply pulled out, {{by means of a}} lanyard, the composition is ignited and sets fire to the powder in the long tube; the flash is conveyed through the vent and ignites the gun charge. For naval purposes, to prevent the sailors from being cut on the face or hurting their feet, tubes of quill instead of copper were used. If friction tubes are employed when cordite or other smokeless powder charges are used, the erosion of the vent is very rapid unless the escape of the gas is prevented; in this case T-headed tubes are used. They are similar in action to the ordinary type, but are fixed to the vent by the head fitting a <b>bayonet</b> <b>joint</b> formed with the vent. The explosion blows a small ball upwards and blocks the coned hole {{at the top of the}} tube and so prevents any rush of gas.|$|E
30|$|Our model reveals {{also that}} roughly one sixth (17.0 %) of the static heat load {{comes from the}} 200 -m {{concentric}} flexible cryogenic transfer lines of corrugated type, one fifth (19.7 %) from the horizontally oriented <b>bayonet</b> <b>joints,</b> and one-third (35.4 %) from the short but non-LN 2 -shielded flexible lines for easy piping. The upstream rigid multi-channel lines {{as well as two}} cryogenic valve boxes, VB # 1 and VB # 2, account for 27.9 % of the static heat load. This information provides one direction to upgrade or to optimize the present cryogenic transfer lines for a subsequent application. The design concept and the calculation approach of a pressure drop for a long helium transfer line developed herein is verified in the example of the 220 -m flexible cryogenic transfer lines as built at NSRRC; we suggest that it is extensible to applications of varied cryogenic loads subject to similar operational constraints.|$|R
30|$|Cryogenic {{transfer}} lines L 1 to L 4, L 12, g 2, and g 10 to g 13, are solid pipes with smooth surfaces, but L 5 to L 11 and g 3 to g 9, {{between the first}} valve box, VB # 1, and the second valve box, VB # 2, are all corrugated flexible {{transfer lines}}. Lines L 7 and L 9, as well as g 5 and g 7, are concentric lines of four-tube design (CRYOFLEX) (Laeger et al. 1978; Blessing et al. 1990) with integrated length 205  m, whereas L 6, L 8, L 10, g 4, g 6 and g 8 are <b>bayonet</b> <b>joints.</b> Because of the varied piping elevation from the experimental hall of TLS to {{the building of the}} SRF laboratory, LHe supply lines L 4 –L 12 and the CGHe return lines g 2 –g 10 have cryogenic piping with ascending and descending sections. Figure  1 shows also the complicated piping path between VB # 1 and VB # 2, with details available in the article presented by Lin et al. (2010).|$|R
6000|$|On, then, all Frenchmen {{that have}} hearts in their bodies! Roar {{with all your}} throats, of {{cartilage}} and metal, ye Sons of Liberty; stir spasmodically whatsoever of utmost faculty is in you, soul, body or spirit; {{for it is the}} hour! Smite, thou Louis Tournay, cartwright of the Marais, old-soldier of the Regiment Dauphine; smite at that Outer Drawbridge chain, though the fiery hail whistles round thee! Never, over nave or felloe, did thy axe strike such a stroke. Down with it, man; down with it to Orcus: let the whole accursed Edifice sink thither, and Tyranny be swallowed up for ever! Mounted, some say {{on the roof of the}} guard-room, some 'on <b>bayonets</b> stuck into <b>joints</b> of the wall,' Louis Tournay smites, brave Aubin Bonnemere (also an old soldier) seconding him: the chain yields, breaks; the huge Drawbridge slams down, thundering (avec fracas). Glorious: and yet, alas, it is still but the outworks. The Eight grim Towers, with their Invalides' musketry, their paving stones and cannon-mouths, still soar aloft intact;--Ditch yawning impassable, stone-faced; the inner Drawbridge with its back towards us: the Bastille is still to take! ...|$|R
