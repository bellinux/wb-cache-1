60|$|But {{where the}} {{characters}} {{which must be}} taken into consideration, in order sufficiently to designate the Kind, are too numerous to be all signified in the derivation of the name, and where no one of them is of such preponderant importance as to justify its being singled out to be so indicated, we may avail ourselves of a subsidiary resource. Though we can not indicate the distinctive properties of the Kind, we may indicate its nearest natural affinities, by incorporating into its name the name of the proximate natural group of which {{it is one of the}} species. On this principle is founded the admirable <b>binary</b> <b>nomenclature</b> of botany and zoology. In this nomenclature the name of every species consists of the name of the genus, or natural group next above it, with a word added to distinguish the particular species. The last portion of the compound name is sometimes taken from some one of the peculiarities in which that species differs from others of the genus; as Clematis integrifolia, Potentilla alba, Viola palustris, Artemisia vulgaris; sometimes from a circumstance of an historical nature, as Narcissus poeticus, Potentilla tormentilla (indicating that the plant is that which was formerly known by the latter name), Exacum Candollii (from the fact that De Candolle was its first discoverer); and sometimes the word is purely conventional, as Thlaspi bursapastoris, Ranunculus thora; it is of little consequence which; since the second, or, as it is usually called, the specific name, could at most express, independently of convention, no more than a very small portion of the connotation of the term. But by adding to this the name of the superior genus, we may make the best amends we can for the impossibility of so contriving the name as to express all the distinctive characters of the Kind. We make it, at all events, express as many of those characters as are common to the proximate natural group in which the Kind is included. If even those common characters are so numerous or so little familiar as to require a further extension of the same resource, we might, instead of a binary, adopt a ternary nomenclature, employing not only the name of the genus, but that of the next natural group in order of generality above the genus, commonly called the Family. This was done in the mineralogical nomenclature proposed by Professor Mohs. “The names framed by him were not composed of two, but of three elements, designating respectively the Species, the Genus, and the Order; thus he has such species as Rhombohedral Lime Haloide, Octohedral Fluor Haloide, Prismatic Hal Baryte.”(226) The binary construction, however, has been found sufficient in botany and zoology, the only sciences in which this general principle has hitherto been successfully adopted in the construction of a nomenclature.|$|E
50|$|Upon their discovery, the microfilariae {{were named}} Filaria sanguinis hominis minor, {{due to their}} {{relatively}} small size when compared to another type of microfilarae found in the same patient (Filaria sanguinis hominis major, which {{is now known as}} Loa loa). The name was later changed to Filaria sanguinis hominis perstans, and later again shortened to Filaria perstans to comply with the <b>binary</b> system of <b>nomenclature.</b> Over time, the name continued to change as changes in the generic status of the parasite took place. In 1984, Eberhard and Orihel redefined the genus Mansonella and included the M. perstans species in it, so it is currently known as M. perstans.|$|R

50|$|Tournefort {{is often}} {{credited}} {{with being the}} first to make {{a clear distinction between}} genus and species. Though he did indeed cluster the 7,000 plant species that he described into around 700 genera, this was not particularly original. Concepts of genus and species had been framed as early as the 16th century, and Kaspar Bauhin in particular consistently distinguished genera and species. Augustus Quirinus Rivinus had even advocated the use of <b>binary</b> <b>nomenclature</b> shortly before Tournefort's work was published.|$|E
50|$|In the {{scientific}} classification established by Carolus Linnaeus, each species {{has to be}} assigned to a genus (<b>binary</b> <b>nomenclature),</b> {{which in turn is}} a lower level of a hierarchy of ranks (family, suborder, order, subclass, class, division/phyla, kingdom and domain).In the currently accepted classification of life, there are three domains (Eukaryotes, Bacteria and Archaea), which, in terms of taxonomy, despite following the same principles have several different conventions between them and between their subdivisions as are studied by different disciplines (botany, zoology, mycology and microbiology), for example in zoology there are type specimens, whereas in microbiology there are type strains.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{scientific}} classification established by Carl von Linné, each bacterial strain {{has to be}} assigned to a species (<b>binary</b> <b>nomenclature),</b> which is {{a lower level of}} a hierarchy of ranks. Currently, the most accepted mega-classification system is under the three-domain system, which is based on molecular phylogeny. In that system, bacteria are members of the domain Bacteria and [...] "phylum" [...] is the rank below domain, since the rank [...] "kingdom" [...] is disused at present in bacterial taxonomy. When bacterial nomenclature was controlled under the Botanical Code, the term division was used, but now that bacterial nomenclature (with the exception of cyanobacteria) is controlled under the Bacteriological Code, the term phylum is preferred.|$|E
5000|$|Binomial {{nomenclature}} (also called {{binominal nomenclature}} or <b>binary</b> <b>nomenclature)</b> is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name {{composed of two}} parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just [...] "binomial"), a binomen, binominal name or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The {{first part of the}} name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus Homo and within this genus to the species Homo sapiens. The formal introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work Species Plantarum in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book Pinax theatri botanici (English, Illustrated exposition of plants) many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.|$|E

40|$|Colletotrichum lindemuthianum is {{a highly}} {{variable}} pathogen of common beans that easily overcomes resistance in cultivars bred with single-gene resistance. To determine pathogenic variability of the pathogen in Uganda, samples of common bean tissues with anthracnose symptoms were collected in eight districts of Uganda, namely Kabarole, Sironko, Mbale, Oyam, Lira, Kapchorwa, Maracha and Kisoro. 51 isolates sporulated successfully on Potato Dextrose Agar and Mathur’s media and were used to inoculate 12 differential cultivars under controlled conditions. Five plants per cultivar were inoculated with each isolate and then evaluated for their reaction using the 1 – 9 severity scale. Races were classified using the <b>binary</b> <b>nomenclature</b> system proposed by Pastor Corrales (1991). Variation due to cultivar and isolate effects was significant (P≤ 0. 001) for severity. The 51 isolates from eight districts grouped into 27 different races. Sironko district had {{the highest number of}} races followed by Mbale and Kabarole. Races 2047 and 4095 were the most frequently found, each with 10 isolates grouped under them. Race 4095 was the most virulent since it caused a susceptible (S) reaction on all 12 differential cultivars and the susceptible check. This was followed by races 2479, 2047 and 2045 respectively. Two races, 4094 and 2479, caused a susceptible reaction on the differential cultivar G 2333, which nevertheless, showed the most broad spectrum resistance followed by cultivars Cornell 49 - 242, TU, and AB 136 respectively. These cultivars are recommended for use in breeding programs aiming at breeding for broad spectrum resistance to bean anthracnose in Uganda...|$|E
40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) {{activates}} the simultaneous proliferation of various pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules. Considering {{the amount of}} factors participating, this response is naturally complex. However, there is an increasing trend in neurotrauma research to delineate the injury-induced inflammatory responses within the constraints of in vitro defined macrophage polarization phenotypes “M 1 ” and “M 2 ”. Here, we evaluate research examining {{the complexity of the}} inflammatory response that cannot be so easily characterized using this <b>binary</b> <b>nomenclature.</b> TBI is demonstrated to induce a broad spectrum of simultaneous expression responses involving both pro- and anti-inflammatory reactions. Specifically, the research revealed a very heterogeneous parenchymal landscape associated with TBI. The concurrent expression of both “M 1 ” and “M 2 ” phenotypic markers on the microglia/macrophages involved suggests that the polarization phenotypes cannot be neatly defined in this M 1 /M 2 paradigm. Recent studies displaying neurotrauma also report similar conflict with the constraints of this binary categorization of “M 1 /M 2 ”, demonstrating that microglia/macrophages cannot effectively cross-over to strictly polarized “M 1 -only” or “M 2 -only” phenotype. Therefore, the complex signaling events surrounding this response indicate that a binary M 1 /M 2 characterization is not adequate to define inflammatory profile. This paper is a review article.

40|$|Gradstein et al. (1982) {{propose to}} {{conserve}} four generic names of Lejeuneaceae: Lopholejeunea (Spruce) Schiffn., Acrolejeunea (Spruce) Schiffn., Trachylejeunea (Spruce) Schiffn. and Taxilejeunea (Spruce) Schiffn., {{each of which}} was introduced as a subgeneric name in Lejeunea by Spruce (1884), and subsequently raised to generic rank by Schiffner in his treatment of the Hepaticae in Engler-Prantl (preprint 1893) [see proposals to conserve 675 - 678 see p. 746]. Although Spruce (l. c.) used for his Lejeunea species a <b>binary</b> <b>nomenclature</b> by combining subgeneric names with specific epithets, it is clear (e. g. text, index) that the binomina are meant as Lejeunea combinations and they are considered as such by most authors (see Gradstein et al. for further details). Before 1893, however, the Sprucean subgeneric names were used in various papers by F. Stephani in a “seeming” generic rank; indeed Stephani now and then referred to them as “genus. ” A chronological survey {{of a number of}} relevant papers by Stephani, mainly those published in Hedwigia, was given by Bonner et al. (1961), in conjunction with a brief discussion of the subject of this paper. These authors were the first to realize that on the basis of Art. 42 ICBN some generic names in Lejeuneaceae, e. g. Taxilejeunea and Trachylejeunea, can be considered as validly published by Stephani in Hedwigia 28, 1889. Later on Grolle (1979) demonstrated valid publication of monotypic new Lejeuneaceae genera by Stephani in the Bot. Gaz. 15, 1890, e. g. Lopho-Lejeunea and Acro-Lejeunea. For an evaluation of the status of Lopho- Lejeunea Steph., Acro-Lejeunea Steph., Trachylejeunea Steph. and Taxilejeunea Steph., one might consider these names against the background of the entire context of Stephani’s work on Lejeuneaceae until 1893. As the survey of Stephani’s papers in Bonner et al. is rather incomplete, and as there are several points of divergence in opinion, a new analysis of Stephani’s relevant papers (before Sep 1893) is presented below...|$|E
40|$|When was the Turk's-cap Lily (Martagon Lily) {{introduced}} to Sweden? In the Swedish Middle Ages or 500 years later, during The Swedish Great Power period? This dissertation contests the widely held position, known as kompendietraditionen, {{according to which}} the Turk's-cap Lily was {{introduced to}} Sweden in the Middle Ages. It conducts a thor-ough examination of (primarily written) Swedish botanical and horticultural sources from the Middle Ages to the final decades of the 18 th century. Its main focus is on Sweden, parallel sources from the other Nordic and relevant European countries, such as England, the Netherlands and Germany, are also analysed in some depth. The investigation examines Turk's-cap Lily’s name history, especially the names lilium and martagon. From antiquity up to Linné’s <b>binary</b> <b>nomenclature</b> and his binary designation: Lilium martagon, the early-scientific names and phrase epithets of the species are analysed together with all the early Swedish names. A {{significant part of the}} thesis is devoted to the analysis of the diffi-culties surrounding correspondences in history between names and actually living plants. Based on documentary evidence, the Turk's-cap Lily’s early history is reconstructed for Swe-den and the other Nordic countries. Our findings show that the first Turk's-cap Lily of the North blossomed in Bergen, Norway, 1597. Introductions of the Turk's-cap Lily in gardens in England and on the Continent were exam-ined for the purpose of putting the history of introduction in Sweden into context. The systematic categorisation and development of the Turk's-cap Lily in relation to the other European lily spe-cies, including their morphological, ecological and genetic conditions, is treated from a historical point of view. A collection of fourteen supplements enlarges and illustrates different aspects of the investigation, such as for instance a supplement about “lillies in the Bible”. The main result of the dissertation is that the Turk's-cap Lily was introduced to Sweden dur-ing {{the first half of the}} 17 th century. The result is confirmed by investigations of the circumstances in the other Nordic countries. The monograph is richly illustrated; some of the old dawings are published for the first time...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} version in Norwegian of Norway’s first flora which was {{published}} in Latin in two volumes in 1766 and 1776 (the second part posthumously, by the nephew N. D. Gunnerus) by bishop Johan Ernst Gunnerus (1718 – 1773) of the Nidaros diocese. He was a well-educated man (in Copenhagen, Halle, and Jena) but he never studied botany. Nevertheless, he felt a religious and patriotic duty to write a flora. He was greatly inspired and supported by his contemporary Carl von Linné who admired his work. Gunnerus includes 1118 numbers in the flora, of which some species (one sponge, now classified as an animal) were new to science. Gunnerus is still recognized as the author of some scientific plant names. The flora is not systematically arranged, but apparently haphazardly, according to when he became acquainted with the species. This is quite cumbersome, as he covers all groups from moulds to forest trees, in free mixture. In spite of the title, the flora covers mainly his diocese, which at Gunnerus’ time included all regions from Romsdal in Møre and Romsdal county to east Finnmark county, to the Russian border. From 1759 to his death he spent much time and effort on visitations during which he often collected specimens. Gunnerus follows the new <b>binary</b> <b>nomenclature</b> of Linné without further discussion, but includes a range of phrase names of earlier authors. The botanical observations are uneven and not always relevant from our perspective. There are many misidentifications. These are particularly revealed when comparing the flora text with his herbarium, which is now kept in herbarium TRH. Sometimes, though, he goes into great detail when he had time to enjoy himself at the microscope, e. g. when describing the function of the annulus in fern sporangia. Usually he just repeats rather briefly previous descriptions. In principle, he claims not to include species which he had not studied personally, a principle clearly not upheld in the second volume. Among the cryptogams he was particularly interested in the algae which, however, he did not understand well. More than once, he described the same species under several different names. The herbarium shows that he often misidentified species, and even included species in the flora which are not growing in Norway. The numerous notes to the text aim at clarifying many of Gunnerus’ mistakes and misunderstandings. In the last chapter Flora Norvegica is compared with some contemporary Norwegian botanical publications, and evaluated from a recent floristical viewpoint. Gunnerus recorded local plant names, including Saami ones. He even created new Norwegian names for many species. A particularly important and surprising aspect of the flora is the insight it gives into daily life in Norway at around the 1760 s, due to his annotations and discussions of plant use {{in all parts of the}} society, though mostly among farmers. The text also gives an insight into the flora of the cultural landscape. Gunnerus was the first to report a number of species growing in Norway; 24 of them by literary records which are considered reliable. For another 102 species his herbarium specimens are the oldest records available. </p...|$|E
