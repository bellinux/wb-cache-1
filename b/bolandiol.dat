25|$|Non-17α-alkylated {{testosterone}} derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone {{all have}} poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. A notable {{exception to this}} are AAS that are androgen precursors or prohormones, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenediol, androstenedione, boldione (androstadienedione), <b>bolandiol</b> (norandrostenediol), bolandione (norandrostenedione), dienedione, mentabolan (MENT dione, trestione), and methoxydienone (methoxygonadiene) (although these are relatively weak AAS). AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively {{in the form of}} esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bolandiol</b> dipropionate (USAN) (brand names Anabiol, Storinal; former {{developmental}} {{code name}} SC-7525), or <b>bolandiol</b> propionate (JAN), {{also known as}} norpropandrolate or 19-nor-4-androstenediol dipropionate, as well as estr-4-ene-3β,17β-diol 3,17-dipropionate, is a synthetic anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and derivative of 19-nortestosterone (nandrolone). It is an androgen ester - specifically, the 3,17-dipropionate ester of <b>bolandiol</b> (19-nor-4-androstenediol).|$|E
50|$|<b>Bolandiol</b> (INN), {{also known}} as 19-nor-4-androstenediol, estr-4-en-3β,17β-diol, or 3β-dihydronandrolone, is an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) that was never marketed. A dipropionate ester, <b>bolandiol</b> dipropionate (brand names Anabiol, Storinal; former {{developmental}} code name SC-7525), has been marketed. <b>Bolandiol</b> (and its dipropionate ester) is unique among AAS in that it reportedly also possesses estrogenic and progestogenic activity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bolandiol</b> {{is on the}} World Anti-Doping Agency's list of {{prohibited}} substances, and {{is therefore}} banned from use in most major sports. It is a potential metabolic precursor to nandrolone. However, several clinical studies have concluded that <b>bolandiol</b> does not alter strength, body composition, or exercise performance.|$|E

40|$|Anabolic steroids {{are widely}} used to {{increase}} skeletal muscle (SM) mass and improve physical performance. Some dietary supplements also include potent steroid precursors or active steroid analogs such as nandrolone. Our previous study reported the anabolic steroid effects on SM in a castrated guinea pig model with SM measured using a highly quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol. The aim {{of the current study}} was to apply this animal model and in vivo MRI protocol to evaluate the growth effects of four widely used over-the-counter testosterone and nandrolone precursors: 4 -androstene- 3 17 -dione (androstenedione), 4 -androstene- 3 β 17 β-diol (4 -androsdiol), 19 -nor- 4 -androstene- 3 β- 17 β-diol (<b>bolandiol)</b> and 19 -nor- 4 -androstene- 3 17 -dione (19 -norandrostenedione). The results showed that providing precursor to castrated male guinea pigs led to plasma steroid levels sufficient to maintain normal SM growth. The anabolic growth effects of these specific precursors on individual and total muscle volumes, sexual organs, and total adipose tissue over a 10 -week treatment period, in comparison with those in the respective positive control testosterone and nandrolone groups, were documented quantitatively by MRI. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
