50|$|Some {{species of}} Robinia {{are used as}} food by larvae of Lepidoptera, {{including}} such moths as the <b>brown-tail</b> (Euproctis chrysorrhoea), the buff-tip (Phalera bucephala), the engrailed (Ectropis crepuscularia), the giant leopard moth (Hypercompe scribonia), the locust underwing (Euparthenos nubilis), and Chrysaster ostensackenella.|$|E
50|$|The {{roots of}} burdock, among other plants, are eaten by the larva of the ghost moth (Hepialus humuli). The plant {{is used as}} a food plant by other Lepidoptera {{including}} <b>brown-tail,</b> Coleophora paripennella, Coleophora peribenanderi, the Gothic, lime-speck pug and scalloped hazel.|$|E
50|$|Cicely Blair wrote a {{paper about}} the rash {{caused by the}} <b>brown-tail</b> moth {{caterpillar}} in 1979. It {{was found that the}} loose hairs break off as barbs and on contact with skin can cause rashes, skin irritation, headaches and breathing difficulties. The species should be handled using protective gloves at all stages of its life cycle.|$|E
50|$|The factors {{underlying}} <b>brown-tail</b> moth {{population dynamics}} are little understood {{and have been}} only thoroughly investigated by few researchers. They found that parasitoids, microsporidial disease and intraspecific competition {{were the most important}} mortality agents. In North America, the incidence of parasitism is the most important factor dictating the persistence of the exotic populations exclusively in coastal habitats. Knowledge concerning the role of plant factors is limited to larval performance and development on different host plants. With regard to weather factors, it is known that diapausing larvae are cold tolerant but susceptible to freezing by extreme cold. In North America, besides parasitism, cold temperatures may prevent the browntail moth from extending its invasive range from coastal to inland habitats. Intraspecific competition may also be implicated in <b>brown-tail</b> moth mortality, since in several populations survival was higher at low densities. During outbreaks browntail moth females show an increased fecundity.|$|E
5000|$|This {{univoltine}} defoliator {{feeds on}} 26 genera of non-resinous {{trees and shrubs}} belonging to 13 different families. Considering that it is unusual for an insect to feed on members belonging to more than two different families, the polyphagy of this pest is remarkable. <b>Brown-tail</b> moth polyphagy, together with its tendency to reach outbreak densities, makes this species a major pest of hardwood forests; it may also attack fruit and ornamental trees.|$|E
50|$|The berries {{are a very}} {{valuable}} food resource for many birds. In Northern California elderberries are a favorite food for migrating band-tailed pigeons. Flocks can strip an entire bush {{in less than an}} hour. Elders are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including <b>brown-tail,</b> buff ermine, dot moth, emperor moth, engrailed moth, swallow-tailed moth and the V-pug. The crushed foliage and immature fruit have a strong fetid smell.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, Acacia {{species are}} {{sometimes}} used as food plants by the larvae of hepialid moths {{of the genus}} Aenetus including A. ligniveren. These burrow horizontally into the trunk then vertically down. Other Lepidoptera larvae which have been recorded feeding on Acacia include <b>brown-tail,</b> Endoclita malabaricus and turnip moth. The leaf-mining larvae of some bucculatricid moths also feed on Acacia; Bucculatrix agilis feeds exclusively on Acacia horrida and Bucculatrix flexuosa feeds exclusively on Acacia nilotica.|$|E
50|$|The foliage is {{sometimes}} eaten by the larvae of Lepidoptera, including emperor moth, willow beauty, white-pinion spotted, common emerald, November moth, pale November moth, mottled pug, green pug, brimstone moth, feathered thorn, <b>brown-tail,</b> yellow-tail, short-cloaked moth, lesser yellow underwing, lesser broad-bordered yellow underwing, double square-spot, black and brown hairstreaks, hawthorn moth (Scythropia crataegella) and the case-bearer moth Coleophora anatipennella. Dead blackthorn wood provides {{food for the}} caterpillars of the concealer moth Esperia oliviella.|$|E
50|$|Amelanchier {{plants are}} {{preferred}} browse for deer and rabbits, and heavy browsing pressure can suppress natural regeneration. Caterpillars of such Lepidoptera as brimstone moth, <b>brown-tail,</b> grey dagger, mottled umber, rough prominent, the satellite, winter moth, and the red-spotted purple {{and the white}} admiral (both Limenitis arthemis), as well as various other herbivorous insects feed on Amelanchier. Many insects and diseases that attack orchard trees also affect this genus, in particular trunk borers and Gymnosporangium rust. In years when late flowers of Amelanchier overlap those of wild roses and brambles, bees may spread bacterial fireblight.|$|E
5000|$|The genus is {{represented}} by about 60 extant species. Among species found in the wild, those most commonly used in cooking are the garden rhubarb (R. rhabarbarum) and the so-called false rhubarb (R. rhaponticum), which is actually a true rhubarb. [...] The many varieties of cultivated rhubarb more usually grown for eating are recognised as Rheum x hybridum in the Royal Horticultural Society's list of recognised plant names.Rheum species have been recorded as larval food plants for some Lepidoptera species including <b>brown-tail,</b> buff ermine, cabbage moth, large yellow underwing, and nutmeg moth.|$|E
50|$|The {{leaves are}} alternate, 15 to 35 cm long, pinnate, with 9 to 19 leaflets. The flowers are {{produced}} in pendulous racemes 10 to 80 cm long, {{similar to those}} of the genus Laburnum, but are purple, violet, pink or white. There is no yellow on the leaves. Flowering is in spring (just before or as the leaves open) in some Asian species, and in mid to late summer in the American species and W. japonica. The flowers of some species are fragrant, most notably W. sinensis. Wisteria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including <b>brown-tail.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{gipsy moth}} was {{introduced}} by accident from Europe into Massachusetts about 1861. [...] The sweet potato weevil was first discovered in 1875. About 1892, the <b>brown-tail</b> moth was introduced near Boston from Europe. The boll weevil entered Texas about 1892 {{in the vicinity of}} Brownsville. The Argentine ant was first discovered in the United States at New Orleans in 1891, New International Encyclopedia and the alfalfa leaf weevil was first discovered in Utah in 1904. Establishing control over an increasing number of insect pests and insect-borne diseases led to the establishment of the Bureau of Entomology.|$|E
50|$|John Douglas Tothill was {{the first}} federal {{forestry}} official appointed in New Brunswick. He studied at the Ontario Agricultural College, specialising in entomology and botany, and in 1922 received a doctorate from Harvard University. He was employed {{for a short period}} by the US Bureau of Entomology Gypsy Moth Parasite laboratory. Tothill later joined the Entomology Branch of the Departmentof Agriculture and established a laboratory on the University of New Brunswick campus in Fredericton.Over the next decade he led research on invasive insects, such as the <b>brown-tail</b> moth Euproctis chrysorrhoea, the gypsy mothLymantria dispar, and native insects such as the forest tent caterpillar Malacosoma disstria, the fall webworm Hyphantria cunea, and the spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana.|$|E
50|$|The {{wax coating}} on the fruit is indigestible for most birds, {{but a few}} species have adapted {{to be able to}} eat it, notably the yellow-rumped warbler and tree swallow in North America. As the wax is very energy-rich, this enables the yellow-rumped warbler to winter further north in cooler climates than any other American warbler if bayberries are present. The seeds are then {{dispersed}} in the birds' droppings. Myrica species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including <b>brown-tail,</b> emperor moth, and winter moth as well as the bucculatricid leaf-miners Bucculatrix cidarella, B. myricae (feeds exclusively on M. gale) and B. paroptila and the Coleophora case-bearers C. comptoniella, C. pruniella, and C. viminetella.|$|E

Most American entomologists are familiar with the story of the 2 ̆ 2 <b>brown-tail</b> moth, 2 ̆ 2 Nygmia phaeorrhoea Donovan, the European species which was introducted into Massachusetts in the 1890 s and became a serious pest in the northeastern United States and adjoining Canada until appropriate control measures were taken. The <b>Brown-tail</b> is a defoliator of forests, orchards and hedgerows, and as D. S.
