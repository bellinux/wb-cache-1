5|$|Like {{most major}} cities, Pittsburgh {{experienced}} {{several days of}} rioting following the assassination of Martin Luther King in April 1968. There were no further major riots, although tension remained high in the inner-city <b>black</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b>|$|E
5|$|Severe {{damage was}} {{received}} by 40 percent of Stuart's residences and commercial structures, and 90 percent required repairs. A church, baseball park, and ice company {{was destroyed in}} the area's <b>black</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b> Many flimsy buildings were destroyed in the neighborhoods. Three portions of the Jensen causeway near Sewall's Point were ripped away. A hangar and beacon was destroyed at the local airport in Martin County. 500 people were homeless in Stuart. A water mark of 8.5 feet (102in) was recorded on the St. Lucie River near Stuart.|$|E
5|$|The {{enhanced}} {{police presence}} {{throughout the city}} during the strike helped to keep the calm, and the restrained approach of the police officers generally won praise from all sides, {{even though many of}} the policemen were seen as sympathetic to the striking white workers. The administration of Philadelphia's Republican mayor Bernard Samuel was also seen as quietly sympathetic to the strikers. Throughout the strike, Mayor Samuel, who was {{also a member of the}} PTC board of directors, avoided any attempts of mediation. He refused to call a meeting of the PTC board of directors or to discuss the crisis with the TWU leaders. The mayor denied police protection to the two TWU officials who were willing to travel throughout the city and advocate an end to the strike. Samuel also refused to grant air time to War Production Board representatives who wanted to make a radio plea to end the strike. On August 2, the mayor declined, without an explanation, the NAACP request for permission to send two sound-trucks into <b>black</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> to broadcast appeals for calm. The city's black population felt disappointed and disenchanted with the actions of the local administration.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Baltimore {{was home to}} several African American classically {{oriented}} music institutions which drew on a rich tradition of symphonic music, chamber concerts, oratorios, documented {{in large part by}} the Baltimore Afro-American, a local periodical. Inspired by A. Jack Thomas, who had been appointed conductor of the city's municipally supported African American performance groups, Charles L. Harris led the Baltimore Colored Chorus and Symphony Orchestra from 1929 to 1939, when a strike led to the company's dissolution. Thomas {{had been one of the}} first black bandleaders in the U.S. Army, was director of the music department at Morgan College, and was the founder of Baltimore's interracial Aeolian Institute for higher musical education. Charles L. Harris, as leader of the Baltimore Colored City Band, took his group to <b>black</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> across Baltimore, playing marches, waltzes and other music, then switch to jazz-like music with an upbeat tempo, meant for dancing. Some of Harris' musicians also played in early jazz clubs, though the musical establishment at the time did not readily accept the style. Fred Huber, Director of Municipal Music for Baltimore, exerted powerful control over the repertoire of these bands, and forbade jazz. T. Henderson Kerr, a prominent black bandleader, emphasized in his advertising that his group did not play jazz, while the prestigious Peabody Institute debated whether jazz was music at all. The Symphony Orchestra produced renowned pianist Ellis Larkins and cellist W. Llewellyn Wilson, also the music critic for the Afro-American. Harris eventually replaced Harris as conductor of the Orchestra and has since become a city musical fixture who is said to have, at one point, taught every single African American music teacher in Baltimore.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Freddie Gray in police custody in 2015, there was rioting in <b>black</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b> The city invited the Department of Justice to conduct an {{investigation}} of the police department and its relations with the community. It found evidence of widespread unconstitutional and discriminatory police practices in the city, especially in poor, <b>black</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of highways {{in some cases}} divided and isolated <b>black</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> from goods and services, many times within industrial corridors. For example, Birmingham's interstate highway system attempted to maintain the racial boundaries that had been established by the city's 1926 racial zoning law. The construction of interstate highways through <b>black</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> in the city led to significant population loss in those neighborhoods and is associated {{with an increase in}} neighborhood racial segregation.|$|E

25|$|Pomerlau led {{reforms that}} {{included}} ending the segregationist practices within the department. In 1968, racial rioting {{in response to}} the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. broke out across the city's <b>black</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b> As few African-American officers held rank within the department, the white-dominated department seemed to confront the African-American community.|$|E
25|$|Churches {{may also}} do work {{to improve the}} {{physical}} infrastructure of the neighborhood. Churches in Harlem have undertaken real estate ventures and renovated burnt-out and abandoned brownstones to create new housing for residents.

5000|$|Some sources {{state the}} {{leveling}} {{of the neighborhood}} for the stadium was part of Mayor Ivan Allen, Jr. [...] "vision was to build an entertainment facility that would bring black and white Atlantans together", [...] "cradled as it was between the commercial business community and the <b>black</b> <b>neighborhood</b> of Summerhill." [...] Other sources note that the original 1940s plan was to route the Downtown Connector freeway {{on the west side}} of downtown; the later plan to route it east of downtown was an effort to remove low-income <b>black</b> <b>neighborhood</b> and provide a buffer between the central business district and what remained of the black Summerhill, Mechanicsville and Peoplestown neighborhoods.|$|R
25|$|During the Civil Rights Movement in {{the late}} 1950s and through the 1960s, Louisville was affected, as it had {{maintained}} a segregated society. Civil rights groups had undertaken a variety of actions to challenge that. In addition, <b>black</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> had declined during the economic downturn of the city. Urban renewal efforts undertaken for ostensible improvements had adversely affected {{the center of their}} neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|The protest demanded {{complete}} {{integration of}} the city's schools (which would require some whites to attend schools in <b>black</b> <b>neighborhoods),</b> and it challenged the coalition between African Americans and white liberals. An ensuing white backlash affected relations among the black leaders. Writing to black labor leaders, Rustin denounced Galamison for seeking to conduct another boycott in the spring, and soon abandoned the coalition.|$|E
25|$|Redlining {{has helped}} {{preserve}} segregated living patterns {{for blacks and}} whites in the United States because discrimination motivated by prejudice is often contingent on the racial composition of neighborhoods where the loan is sought and {{the race of the}} applicant.

There is a higher proportion of Muslims in the Black American population than most cities in America. West Philadelphia also has significant Caribbean and African immigrant populations.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} Rizzo's tenure as deputy {{commissioner}} that {{black and white}} officers assigned to the city's predominantly <b>black</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> worked in tandem {{in an attempt to}} reduce friction between civilians and police forces. As commissioner, Rizzo's department had one of the largest percentages of black officers among large U.S. police departments, with 20% in 1968, at a time when other departments had little if any success in recruiting blacks.|$|E
25|$|White riots {{against blacks}} took place again in Cincinnati in 1836 and 1842.

Tensions increased after congressional passage in 1850 of the Fugitive Slave Act, which required cooperation by citizens in free states and increased penalties for failing to try to recapture escaped slaves.|$|E
50|$|Washington Park is a {{historically}} <b>black</b> <b>neighborhood</b> in northwest Atlanta encompassing historic residential, commercial, and community landmark buildings. It is situated two miles (3 km) {{west of the}} central business district of Atlanta. The combination of gridiron and curvilinear streets {{is a result of}} the neighborhood having been developed from four separate subdivision plats. One of these plats created Atlanta's first planned <b>black</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> while the other three were abandoned by white developers and adopted by Heman Perry, an early 20th-century black developer. Although Perry did not receive a formal education past the seventh grade, in 1913 he founded one of the largest black-owned companies in the United States, the Standard Life Insurance Company of Atlanta.|$|R
