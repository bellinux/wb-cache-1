5|$|Throughout 1940–41, the Militia {{were called}} up in cohorts for periods of {{continuous}} training, and the 3rd Division, still {{consisting of the}} 4th, 10th and 15th Brigades, undertook a series of training camps around Seymour, Victoria. In March 1941, the division's artillery was reorganised to <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> line with the British organisational system with each artillery brigade being converted to a field regiment. Numerical designations stayed the same, however, and by late 1941 the division had completed its transition. This saw its infantry brigades once again reduced from four battalions to three, while various supporting elements were inserted at brigade-level, however, training at this time was still rudimentary and limited mainly to individual skills, and the division's establishment was recorded as being only half of its authorised wartime establishment. There was also a shortage of modern equipment.|$|E

25|$|The {{series was}} {{originally}} pitched to HBO, though the network preferred the series {{to have been}} a Taxicab Confessions-style series taking place at the Gold & Silver's night window. The format eventually evolved into the now-familiar family-oriented motif used on the series. History president Nancy Dubuc, who had been charged with creating programming with a more populist appeal to balance out the network's in-depth military programming, picked up the series, which was initially titled Pawning History, before a staffer at Leftfield suggested that Pawn Stars would fit better with the locale. The network concurred, believing that name to be more pleasing and easily remembered. The staffer adjusted its story-line in order to <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> line with the network's brand, which included the on-camera experts appraising the items brought into the Gold & Silver, though she did not discourage the interpersonal conflicts among the show's stars.|$|E
25|$|Reorganized Governor Pierpont {{recalled}} the Reorganized state legislature, which voted on May 13 {{to approve the}} secession. After much debate over whether Virginia had truly given its consent {{to the formation of}} the new state, the United States Congress adopted a statehood bill on July 14, 1862. President Lincoln was unsure of the bill's constitutionality, but pressed by Northern senators he signed the legislation on December 31, 1862. Luckily, the West Virginia constitutional convention had not adjourned sine die, and was called back into session on February 12, 1863, to amend the state's constitution to <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> line with changes required by the federal statehood bill. The convention amended the state's constitution on February 17 and adjourned sine die on February 20. The state's voters ratified the amended constitution on March 26, 1863. On April 20, President Lincoln announced that West Virginia would become a state in 60days.|$|E

25|$|The battalion's first {{commanding}} officer was Lieutenant Colonel John Mitchell, {{who had served}} in the 8th Battalion during World War I and had subsequently commanded it during the inter-war years. Like Mitchell, the majority of the battalion's recruits came from the state of Victoria, with about one in every five having previously served in the Militia. Shortly after the battalion's establishment it was moved to Puckapunyal where it began individual training. In early 1940, the Australian Army was reorganised to <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> line with the British Army by reducing the size of each brigade from four infantry battalions to three. The result of this was that 2/8th, as the fourth battalion within the 17th Brigade, was transferred to a new brigade, the 19th, which was formed from the 2/4th Battalion, a New South Wales battalion from the 16th Brigade, the 2/8th from the 17th and the Western Australian 2/11th from the 18th. After the completion of basic training, the battalion marched through the streets of Melbourne before embarking for the Middle East in mid-April aboard the troopship Dunera.|$|E

500|$|As the Allies retreated, No.3 Squadron {{transferred}} to Lydda in Palestine, and began re-equipping with P-40 Tomahawks on 14May. Rawlinson was appointed a flight commander the same month. He became an ace during the Syrian {{campaign against the}} Vichy French in June–July 1941. On 28June, he was leading a patrol of nine Tomahawks near Palmyra that came upon six French Martin167 bombers, and shot down all six; Rawlinson was credited with three victories, raising his total to six. The squadron remained in Syria following the armistice with the French on 14July. Rawlinson was allocated a new Tomahawk, nicknamed Sweet FA, which he shared with another No.3 Squadron ace, Peter Turnbull. On 22August, Rawlinson was practising aerobatics in Sweet FA when the right tailplane detached, damaging the tailfin in the process; he could only control the aircraft by flying at [...] but was able to <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> for a landing, without flaps, at the higher-than-normal speed.|$|E

500|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the Internet buzz for {{what had been a}} minor film in their 2006 line-up, New Line Cinema ordered five days of additional shooting in early March 2006 (principal photography had wrapped in September 2005). While re-shoots normally imply problems with a film, the producers opted to add new scenes to the film to change the MPAA rating from PG-13 to R and <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> line with growing fan expectations. The most notable addition was a revision of a catchphrase from the film that was parodied on the Internet by fans of the film, capitalizing on Samuel L. Jackson's typically foul-mouthed and violent film persona: [...] "Enough is enough! I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!". Subsequently, the public responded favorably to this creative change and marketing strategy, leading some members of the press to speculate that [...] "the movie has grown from something of a joke into a phenomenon".|$|E
500|$|The {{battalion}} {{was formed}} in the United Kingdom on 27 June 1940 from Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) personnel that had originally been designated for service in non-infantry roles who were grouped together to form an infantry battalion. Initially designated as the [...] "70th Battalion", due to manpower shortages {{at first it was}} composed of only three rifle companies instead of the normal establishment of four. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Horace Strutt the battalion was initially based at Tidworth. In August 1940, Strutt was replaced with Lieutenant Colonel Ragnar Garrett as commanding officer. [...] In October 1940, the battalion's designation was changed to the [...] "2/31st Battalion" [...] in order to <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> line with the designations {{of the rest of the}} 2nd AIF, and it moved to Colchester. In November, the battalion was assigned to the 25th Brigade. It was during this time the battalion suffered its first casualty, when one of its members was killed in a German air raid. While in England the battalion undertook training and was employed on defensive duties, guarding against a possible invasion by German forces.|$|E
500|$|In 1860, {{anticipating the}} American Civil War, the Mormons {{established}} {{a number of}} settlements to grow cotton along the Virgin River in Washington County, Utah. [...] From 1863 to 1865, Mormon colonists founded St. Thomas and other colonies on the Muddy and Virgin rivers in northwestern Arizona Territory, (now Clark County, Nevada). [...] Stone's Ferry was established by these colonists on the Colorado {{at the mouth of}} the Virgin River to carry their produce on a wagon road to the mining districts of Mohave County, Arizona to the south. [...] Also, in 1866, a steamboat landing was established at Callville, intended as an outlet to the Pacific Ocean via the Colorado River, for Mormon settlements in the Great Basin. [...] These settlements reached a peak population of about 600 before being abandoned in 1871, and for nearly a decade these valleys became a haven for outlaws and cattle rustlers. [...] One Mormon settler Daniel Bonelli, remained, operating the ferry and began mining salt in nearby mines, <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> barges, down river to El Dorado Canyon where it was used to process silver ore. [...] From 1879 to 1887, Colorado Steam Navigation Company steamboats carried the salt, operating up river in the high spring flood waters, through Boulder Canyon, to the landing at Rioville {{at the mouth of the}} Virgin River. [...] From 1879 to 1882 the Southwestern Mining Company, largest in El Dorado Canyon, brought in a 56-foot sloop the Sou'Wester that sailed up and down river carrying the salt in the low water time of year until it was wrecked in the Quick and Dirty Rapids of Black Canyon.|$|E
