40|$|In {{this article}} we present an {{interactive}} automated robot called RoboBeggar that has fund raising capabilities. The system consists of a human-like multimodal robotic unit controlled by a computer. A stand with a touch screen display and a <b>bank</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> provides access to the elearning and e-commerce applications of the robot. The primary use for the existing robotic system is to collect donations for charity activities and to transfer charity related knowledge to the users of the robot. The robot can be placed in major public places. In the test case presented in this article, its location was a church during the Christmas festivities of 2004. The control system of the robot is a software built upon a Java framework {{in a way that}} it can be used for a variety of applications where human interaction is required (i. e. shopping, listing adviser, consultancy, etc). This article describes the architecture of the robotic system, the solution chosen for the simple management of its complex interface modules and its feasibility for providing insightful data about human interaction. In {{this article we}} also discuss possible user scenarios and future perspectives...|$|E

50|$|There {{have also}} {{been a number of}} {{incidents}} of fraud by Man-in-the-middle attacks, where criminals have attached fake keypads or <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> to existing machines. These have then been used to record customers' PINs and <b>bank</b> <b>card</b> information in order to gain unauthorised access to their accounts. Various ATM manufacturers have put in place countermeasures to protect the equipment they manufacture from these threats.|$|R
50|$|A Web ATM is {{an online}} {{interface}} for ATM <b>card</b> <b>banking</b> {{that uses a}} smart <b>card</b> <b>reader.</b> All the usual ATM functions are available, except for withdrawing cash. Most banks in Taiwan provide these online services.|$|R
5000|$|The PIN is used {{to verify}} the {{identity}} of a customer (the user of a <b>bank</b> <b>card)</b> within an electronic funds transfer system, and (typically) to authorize the transfer or withdrawal of funds. Therefore, it is important to protect PINs against unauthorized disclosure or misuse. Modern banking systems require interoperability between a variety of PIN entry devices, smart <b>cards,</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers,</b> <b>card</b> issuers, acquiring <b>banks</b> and retailers [...] - [...] including transmission of PINs between those entities [...] - [...] so a common set of rules for handling and securing PINs is required, both to ensure technical compatibility and a mutually agreed level of security. ISO 9564 provides principles and techniques to meet these requirements.|$|R
50|$|Banking {{agents are}} usually {{equipped}} {{with a combination of}} point-of-sale (POS) <b>card</b> <b>reader,</b> mobile phone, barcode scanner to scan bills for bill payment transactions, personal identification number (PIN) pads, and sometimes personal computers (PCs) that connect with the bankâ€™s server using a personal dial-up or other data connection. Clients that transact at the agent use a magstripe <b>bank</b> <b>card</b> or their mobile phone to access their bank account or e-wallet respectively. Identification of customers is normally done through a PIN, but could also involve biometrics. With regard to the transaction verification, authorization, and settlement platform, banking agents are similar to any other remote bank channel.|$|R

The {{number of different}} memory cards that a multi <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> can accept is expressed as x-in-1, with x being a figure of merit indicating the number of memory cards accepted, such as 35-in-1. There are three categories of <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> sorted by the type and quantity of the card slots: single <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> (e.g. 1x SD-only), multi <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> (e.g. 9-in-1) and series <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> (e.g. 4x SD-only).|$|R
5000|$|The Tappr <b>Card</b> <b>Reader</b> {{is a smart}} Payment Terminal {{designed}} and developed by Tappr in Brisbane, Australia. The Tappr <b>Card</b> <b>Reader</b> combines credit and debit card acceptance with an App Marketplace and supports digital wallets, P2P payments, transportation schemes and Bitcoins. The <b>Card</b> <b>Reader</b> runs Android Ice Cream Sandwich and Tappr has built their own SDK which is currently available in beta to enlisted third party developers to develop apps for the <b>Card</b> <b>Reader.</b> The <b>Card</b> <b>Reader</b> supports the ARM A8 processor with 512 MB of RAM to provide adequate capacity for apps with high graphics and data requirements. The <b>Card</b> <b>Reader</b> also supports a TFT 2.8" [...] color LCD touch screen for added functionality. Tappr's aims to release their SDK to the public after official launch of the Tappr <b>Card</b> <b>Reader.</b> Tappr claims the <b>Card</b> <b>Reader</b> to be a Gen 2 product in mPOS hardware. Hales suggests while many people will use the Tappr <b>Card</b> <b>Reader</b> to [...] "just" [...] accept a payment, opening up our SDK to the developer community opens up a new world to enrich the relationship between merchants and consumers by offering new and exciting ways {{to buy and sell}} things. The Tappr <b>Card</b> <b>Reader</b> will be release in three colors varieties including Black, White and Blue, however other colors will be available once pilot production is commenced.

50|$|A common {{alternative}} {{is the use}} of a <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> which may be capable of reading several types of storage media, as well as high speed transfer of data to the computer. Use of a <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> also avoids draining the camera battery during the download process. An external <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> allows convenient direct access to the images on a collection of storage media. But if only one storage card is in use, moving it {{back and forth between the}} camera and the reader can be inconvenient. Many computers have a <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> built in, at least for SD cards.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is to review {{the use of the}} Government-wide {{commercial}} <b>bank</b> <b>card</b> known as the International Merchant Purchase Agreement Card (I. M. P. A. C.) at the Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division (NAWCWPNS), China Lake, CA. The intent of the study is to analyze the <b>bank</b> <b>card</b> program. It will identify the basic procedures involved in using the <b>bank</b> <b>card,</b> and will evaluate how China Lake cardholders feel the card has affected their small purchase performance. A survey was developed to assess the <b>bank</b> <b>card</b> program. Cardholders were the respondents of the survey. <b>Bank</b> <b>card</b> data were reviewed from the General Services Administration to determine the status of the program. The conclusions of this research are that the <b>bank</b> <b>card</b> program at NAWCWPNS has been extremely effective. Recommendations include selecting NAWCWPNS as a site for <b>bank</b> <b>card</b> experiments and/or policy and procedural changes to the program. NAWCWPNS can also initiate a DOD council to continue to improve and promote the use of the <b>bank</b> <b>card</b> as a vehicle to support the recommendations of the National Performance Review (NPR) regarding small purchases.
