Livvy tells Destiny and her father that she has been immortal since camp, and that she and Ross {{exchanged}} blood.

500|$|Skyscrapers, {{particularly}} those in New York, attracted considerable comment, much of it negative. On his return to New York, writer Henry James condemned the buildings in The American Scene as simply [...] "giants of the mere market", [...] "mercenary monsters" [...] doomed to be torn down in turn as other, even larger, buildings took their place. In Chicago {{the combination of the}} environmental pollution and skyscrapers meant that, as Charles Warner complained, [...] "one can scarcely see across the streets on a damp day, and the huge buildings loom up in the <b>black</b> <b>sky</b> in ghostly dimness".|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{employed a}} case study strategy to examine the benefits of using synthetic environments to provide mission preparation for command and control teams prior to a large-scale, live warfighting exercise. During Pitch Black 08, we compared the performance of two Air Battle Management (ABM) teams from 41 Wing, Surveillance and Response Group: one team prepared by supporting normal flying operations, the other {{took part in a}} virtual mission preparation exercise named <b>Black</b> <b>Skies</b> 08. The synthetic environment provided in <b>Black</b> <b>Skies</b> 08 was designed to simulate Pitch Black 08 as closely as possible in terms of mission scenarios, order of battle, airspace, procedures, and tactics. The evaluation of the training provided in the virtual mission preparation was carried out using the four-level model developed by Kirkpatrick (1959) : Reaction, Learning, Behavioural, and Results critera. The members of the ABM team that participated in <b>Black</b> <b>Skies</b> 08 reported that the virtual mission preparation compared favourably to both regular training and live exercises in terms of the capacity to provide training experiences critical to the ABM role. Over the course of the virtual mission preparation, the ABM team displayed a marked improvement in teamwork processes, motivational state, and across most mission essential tasks. During the subsequent live warfighting exercise, the teamwork processes and taskwork performance of this tea...|$|R

50|$|Voodoo Johnson’s first release {{with their}} new singer was the digital single <b>Black</b> <b>Skies</b> Mist, {{recorded}} once again at Outhouse Studios. The track is notable as a collaboration with Diamond Head’s Brian Tatler, who contacted the band after they named him as an influence {{in an interview with}} Classic Rock magazine.
