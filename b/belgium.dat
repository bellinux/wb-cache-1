5|$|After the {{experience}} of World War II, <b>Belgium</b> abandoned its neutral stance in international politics, in favour of military, political and economic integration. In 1949, <b>Belgium</b> joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and deployed troops to fight alongside other United Nations forces in the Korean War in 1950. <b>Belgium</b> was also {{a key player in}} the unsuccessful negotiations about the creation of a European Defence Community (EDC) in the 1950s. <b>Belgium</b> was assigned a sector of the British zone in West Germany, around the city of Cologne, which it occupied from 1945. Belgian soldiers remained in Germany until their final withdrawal in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Because the UK is {{not part}} of the Schengen Area, and because <b>Belgium</b> and France are not part of the Common Travel Area, all Eurostar {{passengers}} must go through border controls. Both the British Government and the Schengen governments concerned (<b>Belgium</b> and France) have legal obligations to check the travel documents of those entering their respective countries (as well as those leaving, in the case of <b>Belgium</b> and France).|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Piron served {{during the}} German {{invasion}} of <b>Belgium</b> (10–28May 1940), {{after which the}} Belgian Army surrendered and <b>Belgium</b> was placed under military occupation. Piron, however, {{refused to accept the}} Belgian surrender and succeeded in escaping from occupied <b>Belgium</b> via France and Spain to British Gibraltar. He arrived in Scotland in February 1942.|$|E

50|$|Although {{most of the}} province, {{including}} the fortress city of Venlo, at the time <b>Belgium's</b> northernmost fortress, was under Belgian control following <b>Belgium's</b> de facto independence after French intervention, the city of Maastricht remained in Dutch hands.|$|R
50|$|In the south, the Haspengouw (Hesbaye), {{predominantly}} {{situated in}} Limburg, is now <b>Belgium's</b> major area for fruit growing. In Limburg more than 50% of <b>Belgium's</b> fruit production is grown. Of the rest about 40% is grown in other Dutch speaking provinces.|$|R
5|$|Following the World Cup, <b>Belgium</b> {{embarked}} on their qualification campaign for Euro 2016. Mertens netted his first brace for <b>Belgium</b> in their opening qualifying match, netting twice in three {{minutes in a}} 6–0 win over Andorra. The following year, he scored one and assisted another in a 3–1 win over Israel which ensured that <b>Belgium</b> secured top spot in their qualifying group. He was later named in Belgium's squad for the tournament proper and featured in all five of the nation's matches as <b>Belgium</b> fell at the quarter-final stage once again, this time losing out to Wales.|$|E
5|$|He was in Canada when World War I {{started and}} joined a Canadian regiment. He {{was killed in}} <b>Belgium</b> {{fighting}} with the 29th Canadians (Tobin’s Tigers). He is buried in Ridge Wood Military Cemetery, <b>Belgium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Politically, the Belgians did {{not trust}} the French. Marshal Philippe Pétain had {{suggested}} a French strike at Germany's Ruhr area using <b>Belgium</b> as a spring-board in October 1930 and again in January 1933. <b>Belgium</b> feared it would be drawn into a war regardless, and sought to avoid that eventuality. The Belgians also feared being drawn into a war {{as a result of}} the French–Soviet pact of May 1935. The Franco-Belgian agreement stipulated <b>Belgium</b> was to mobilise if the Germans did, but what was not clear was whether <b>Belgium</b> would have to mobilise in the event of a German invasion of Poland.|$|E

The vast majority were recent immigrants to <b>Belgium</b> fleeing persecution in Germany and Eastern Europe and, as a result, only a small minority actually possessed Belgian citizenship.|$|E

5|$|<b>Belgium</b> {{failed to}} {{progress}} {{past the first}} round of their earliest five World Cup participations. After two scoreless defeats at the inaugural World Cup in 1930, the team scored in their first-round knockout games in the 1934 and 1938 editions—but only enough to save their honour. In 1954, they tied with England (4–4 after extra time), and in 1970, they won their first World Cup match, against El Salvador (3–0). From 1982 until 2002, <b>Belgium</b> reached six successive World Cups by playing qualification rounds, advancing to the second phase five times. In the 1982 FIFA World Cup opener, <b>Belgium</b> beat defending champions Argentina 1–0. Their tournament ended in the second group stage, after a Polish hat-trick by Zbigniew Boniek and a 0–1 loss against the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|<b>Belgium</b> had {{pursued a}} policy of {{neutrality}} since its independence in 1830, successfully avoiding becoming a belligerent in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71). In World War I, the German Empire invaded <b>Belgium.</b> During the ensuing occupation, the Allies encouraged Belgian workers to resist the occupiers through non-compliance, leading to large-scale reprisals against Belgian civilians by the German army.|$|E
5|$|<b>Belgium</b> {{has seven}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 52% of its electricity. Belgian {{spent nuclear fuel}} was initially sent for reprocessing in France. In 1993, reprocessing was suspended following {{a resolution of the}} Belgian parliament; spent fuel is since being stored on the sites of the nuclear power plants. The deep disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) has been studied in <b>Belgium</b> for more than 30 years. Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW disposal. The Hades underground research laboratory (URL) is located at −223 m in the Boom Formation at the Mol site. The Belgian URL is operated by the Euridice Economic Interest Group, a joint organisation between SCK•CEN, the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre which initiated the research on waste disposal in <b>Belgium</b> in the 1970s and 1980s and ONDRAF/NIRAS, the Belgian agency for radioactive waste management. In <b>Belgium,</b> the regulatory body in charge of guidance and licensing approval is the Federal Agency of Nuclear Control, created in 2001.|$|E
