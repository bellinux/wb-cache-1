The response of the system will be simulated by using Fuzzy Logic Toolbox in MATLAB and PID controller. The purpose of this controller is to brake a car when the car approaches for an obstacle at a specific range. For this, the Fuzzy Logic Controller is design using the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox in MATLAB. The system uses four rules and three membership function. The two parameters such as distance and speed will be observed for both controllers {{and the ability to}} attenuate disturbance will be simulated. Output of the controller will determine the force of the car <b>brake.</b> <b>Base</b> on the simulation, it can be concluded that the response of Fuzzy Logic Controller is better than PID. However, PID controller can be used to constitute a reference for the performance of the fuzzy logic controller...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} work is {{an investigation of}} active and passive methods to reduce rollover tendency of a three wheeled platform. This configuration is common in small to medium aircraft landing gears, mobile robots, and fuel efficient futuristic concept vehicles. In developing countries three wheeled vehicles (TWV) have a significant share in point to point public transport. Such vehicles have a higher rollover risk resulting in significant single vehicle fatal crashes, and thus are {{the main focus of}} the current research. In Delta configuration the front single wheel offers no roll resistance, hence no lateral load transfer takes place during cornering at the front axle. The effect on directional behaviour is evaluated for this unique lateral load transfer setup. Dynamics of the vehicle are studied in the state space spanned by the yaw rate and side slip angle. These states encompass the directional behaviour of the vehicle fairly well. The effect on roll over and directional behaviour is assessed. For aircraft tricycle landing gears limit handling behaviour in the form of over-steering behaviour appears much before an un-tripped rollover. This is also observed for existing commercial three wheeled vehicles used for public transport when operated on low friction surfaces. This results in immediate loss of control resulting in collision with other vehicles or road sides resulting in tripped rollovers. Factor effecting passive rollover propensity are related to possible changes in directional response of the vehicle. For delta configuration vehicles, braking unloads the rear axle, reducing the lateral load transfer required for rollover. Due relatively low yaw inertia the vehicle response to steering inputs is also better for three wheeled platforms. Based on these observations an active front steering based sliding mode controller is presented for rollover prevention. A vehicle model for direct control of roll angle using steering as an input is developed. An adapting reference based on roll angle at steady state conditions corresponding to a threshold lateral load transfer ratio, is used for sliding surface design. The robustness of the controller is demonstrated using a nonlinear model of CarSim software. The yaw rate error introduced by increasing the turn radius by the controller is than compensated using a <b>brake</b> <b>based</b> system. Both differential <b>braking</b> <b>based</b> Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) and proportional braking are evaluated for efficacy. Giving a higher priority to rollover mitigation, the active front steering is always activated after a threshold lateral load transfer value. The <b>brake</b> <b>based</b> systems are also evaluated for directional control of the vehicle on low friction surfaces. A rule based integration scheme based upon performance of the steering and <b>brake</b> <b>based</b> controllers is proposed.

40|$|Abstract. Vehicle {{stability}} in 4 wheel drive(4 WD) vehicles has been pursued by torque split <b>based</b> technology and <b>brake</b> <b>based</b> technology. The <b>brake</b> <b>based</b> methods are essentially brake maneuver strategies using the active {{control of the}} individual wheel brake. By comparison, the torque split based technologies realize stability by varying the traction torque split through powertrain to create an offset yaw moment. In the 4 WD hybrid electric vehicle adopting separate front and rear motor, the vehicle stability enhancement algorithm using the rear motor control has some advantages such as faster response, braking energy recuperation, etc. However, since {{the left and right}} wheels are controlled by the same driving and regenerative torque from one motor, stability enhancement only by the front and rear motor control has a limitation in satisfying the required offset yaw moment. Therefore, to obtain the demanded offset yaw moment, a brake force distribution at each wheel is required. In this paper, a vehicle stability control logic using the front and rear motor and electro-hydraulic brake(EHB) is proposed for a 4 WD hybrid electric vehicle. A fuzzy control algorithm is suggested to compensate the error of the sideslip angle and the yaw rate by generating the direct yaw moment. Performance of the vehicle stability control algorithm is evaluated using ADAMS and MATLAB Simulink co-simulation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{principle}} of integrated vehicle dynamics control through proposing a new control configuration to coordinate active steering subsystems and dynamic stability control (DSC) subsystems. The active steering subsystems include Active Front Steering (AFS) and Active Rear Steering (ARS); the dynamic stability control subsystems include driveline <b>based,</b> <b>brake</b> <b>based</b> and driveline plus <b>brake</b> <b>based</b> DSC subsystems. A nonlinear vehicle handling model is developed for this study, incorporating the load transfer effects and nonlinear tyre characteristics. This model consists of 8 degrees of freedom that include longitudinal, lateral and yaw motions of the vehicle and body roll motion relative to the chassis about the roll axis {{as well as the}} rotational dynamics of four wheels. The lateral vehicle dynamics are analysed for the entire handling region and two distinct control objectives are defined, i. e. steerability and stability which correspond to yaw rate tracking and sideslip motion bounding, respectively. Active steering subsystem controllers and dynamic stability subsystem controller are designed by using the Sliding Mode Control (SMC) technique and phase-plane method, respectively. The former is used as the steerability controller to track the reference yaw rate and the latter serves as the stability controller to bound the sideslip motion of the vehicle. Both stand-alone controllers are evaluated over a range of different handling regimes. The stand-alone steerability controllers are found to be very effective in improving vehicle steering response up to the handling limit and the stand-alone stability controller is found to be capable of performing the task of maintaining vehicle stability at the operating points where the active steering subsystems cannot. Based on the two independently developed stand-alone controllers, a novel rule based integration scheme for AFS and driveline plus <b>brake</b> <b>based</b> DSC is proposed to optimise the overall vehicle performance by minimising interactions between the two subsystems and extending functionalities of individual subsystems. The proposed integrated control system is assessed by comparing it to corresponding combined control. Through the simulation work conducted under critical driving conditions, the proposed integrated control system is found to lead to a trade-off between stability and limit steerability, improved vehicle stability and reduced influence on the longitudinal vehicle dynamics.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis describes an investigation into vehicle handling control using active differentials in the rear axle of a motor vehicle. Such devices are able to transfer torque between the rear wheels and have traditionally been used to improve traction whilst minimising the impact on vehicle handling. However, the capacity to generate a lateral torque difference across an axle also gives them {{the potential to be}} used for yaw moment control. In order to generate a rigorous assessment of this potential, the investigation is carried out in three distinct phases. Firstly, an analysis of the scope for modifying vehicle handling given unrestricted control over torque transfer between the rear wheels is carded out in the simulation environment. For this purpose an idealised yaw sideslip controller is developed. This is used to show that an ideal active differential can have significant yaw moment authority in terms of generating both understeer and oversteer and that this can be used to actively modify a vehicle's handling balance and apply stability control at the limits of adhesion. In the second phase, the capabilities of two types of contemporary active differential, the torque vectoring differential (TVD) and active limited slip differential (ALSID), are then assessed against the ideal differential and against a <b>brake</b> <b>based</b> yaw moment controller. TVDs are found to be able to offer very similar performance to both their ideal counterpart and to the <b>brake</b> <b>based</b> system. They Gan also deliver this performance with a fraction of the energy loss that is observed in the brakes, thus making TVDs a viable proposition for applying continuous yaw control below the limits of adhesion. ALSDs, on the other hand do not offer equivalent functionality to an ideal active differential but are still shown to be very effective stability control devices. In the third phase, the ALSID results are validated on a prototype vehicle where it is shown that they do indeed offer substantial stability improvements both on high and low-P surfaces. However in order to deliver such benefits and be practical for implementation, it is also shown that significant redevelopment of the idealised controller is required.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{principle}} of co-ordination of chassis subsystems by proposing a new control structure for co-ordinating active steering technologies and a <b>brake</b> <b>based</b> directional stability controller. A non-linear vehicle handling model was developed for this study using the Mattab and Simulink tools. This consists of a 4 degree of freedom (d. o. f) lumped-parameter model that includes longitudinal, lateral, yaw and roll motions with quasi-static longitudinal load transfer effects including non-linear suspension and tyre descriptions. The non-linear vehicle dynamics are discussed for the whole operating regime and two specific driving tasks are identified, steerability and stability. In {{the context of the}} vehicle states these are yaw rate control and side slip angle bounding respectively. Linear active steering controllers for front, rear and four wheel steering are designed and evaluated {{in the context of the}} vehicle handling problem throughout the non-linear operating regime to assist the driver in the two driving tasks previously defined. It is shown through the analysis of the vehicle dynamics in the Chapter 3 that linear controllers can be used to significantly improve the handling behaviour of a non-linear vehicle when only one active input is considered, however when controlling two active inputs, non-linear multivariable approach is required to deal with the strongly coupled nature of the vehicle handling with respect to front and rear steering inputs. A <b>brake</b> <b>based</b> stability system that reflects the state of the art is implemented. The work then proposes a novel co-ordination controller structure for coordination of an active steering controllers and a <b>brake</b> <b>based</b> stability controller for improving to vehicle handling control. The controller was assessed both in steady state and transient tests selected to simulate real world driving manoeuvres over the whole non-linear vehicle handling regime. The co-ordination controller is found to lead to a trade-off between stability and limit cornering performance. The proposed structure improves vehicle stability and reduces interactions in the longitudinal vehicle motion. A detailed discussion of the implications of a coordinated control approach showing it to be a powerful tool providing, the interactions can be conveniently related vehicle handling task and that an appropriate measure of vehicle performance is available. The limitations of the approach are discussed. The most significant limitations being a) the difficulty in proving the optimalty of a heuristic control structure, b) the difficult in assessing the controller behaviour and its interaction with a real driver and c) the likely complexity of the rule base for coordinating more than 2 or 3 systems or describing more complex interactions than were observed here.
