40|$|The Great East Japan Earthquake of March 11, 2011, {{together}} with the subsequent tsunami and nuclear power station accident, damaged a wide area of land. Children who experienced these terrible disasters and the post-disaster situation are still suffering in mental, physical and social ways. Children’s play is an activity that they undertake naturally and which can help them recover from such disasters. This paper addresses the role of play, adventure playgrounds and other play interventions, including play buses, for the health triangle, which addresses mental, physical and social issues of children after the disasters. These interventions were shown to be effective because children could express their stress. This included play for their mental health, different body movements for their physical health and communication with playworkers and new friends for restructuring their social health. These three aspects relate to and support each other within the health triangle. An increase in childhood obesity and lack of exercise is an additional health issue in Fukushima. For a <b>balanced</b> <b>recovery</b> within the health triangle, more play environments should be provided and some improved.

40|$|Although {{widely used}} in {{proteomics}} research for the selective enrichment of phosphopeptides from protein digests, immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) often suffers from low specificity and differential recovery of peptides carrying different numbers of phosphate groups. By systematically evaluating and optimizing different loading, washing, and elution conditions, we have developed an efficient and highly selective procedure for the enrichment of phosphopeptides using a commercially available gallium(III) -IMAC column (PhosphoProfile, Sigma). Phosphopeptide enrichment using the reagents supplied with the column is incomplete and biased toward the recovery and/or detection of smaller, singly phosphorylated peptides. In contrast, elution with base (0. 4 M ammonium hydroxide) gives efficient and <b>balanced</b> <b>recovery</b> of both singly and multiply phosphorylated peptides, while loading peptides in a strong acidic solution (1 % trifluoracetic acid) further increases selectivity toward phosphopeptides, with minimal carryover of nonphosphorylated peptides. 2, 5 -Dihydroxybenzoic acid, a matrix commonly used when analyzing phosphopeptides by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry was also evaluated as an additive in loading and eluting solvents. Elution with 50 % acetonitrile containing 20 mg/mL dihydroxybenzoic acid and 1 % phosphoric acid gave results similar to those obtained using ammonium hydroxide as the eluent, although the latter showed the highest specificity for phosphorylated peptides...|$|E
40|$|Global {{imbalances}} narrowed {{during the}} crisis, but {{a strong and}} <b>balanced</b> <b>recovery</b> requires that this narrowing be made more durable. Before the crisis, a number of economies experienced large and persistent current account imbalances (Figure 4. 1). These imbalances shrank sharply in 2009, reflecting both cyclical and more lasting developments. In economies with large external deficits before the crisis, most notably the United States, private demand {{is likely to remain}} below the precrisis trend as households repair their balance sheets, and a strong recovery will require an increase in net exports. For surplus economies facing weaker demand from deficit economies, the challenge is to rebalance growth from external sources to domestic sources and to run smaller surpluses in the future. Together, these two adjustments could promote a strong and balanced global recovery. Economies with large external surpluses may hesitate to adopt policies that help rebalance demand because of concerns that this could slow their economic growth. In particular, they may be concerned about declining competitiveness, shrinking output in the tradables sector, and a slowdown in productivity and output growth. But while there is a substantial literature that examines deficit reversals, 1 very {{little is known about the}} nature of past current account surplus reversals, including their implications for growth, especially when these reversals were policy driven.

Key findings: 	The G 20 ’s work has myriad implications for non-member countries. The G 20 process needs to reflect this in a meaningful way. 	The first step for the G 20 to assuming its broader, global responsibility is to push ahead with its efforts to promote growth in the G 20 economies, since other countries will also significantly benefit from a stronger, more sustainable and more <b>balanced</b> <b>recovery</b> in the world’s biggest economies. 	The G 20 can do a lot to address non-member countries’ concerns without losing its focus and core agenda. Promoting reform in international organisations and facilitating productive cooperation with non-members and invited guests are two key areas. 	Now that the G 20 approaches its six anniversary, the effectiveness of its outreach process warrants a constructive and outcome-oriented debate. Outreach is of critical importance to the G 20 ’s long-term success. In addition to enhancing its outreach efforts, the G 20 ’s accountability and outcome focus need to be strengthened in order to manifest its position as the world’s ‘premier forum for international cooperation’...|$|E

This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-Archiving. ?? 2015 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty LtdAims In occupational settings, burnout is a common response to chronic exposure stressors and has been frequently documented in formal caregivers (i. e. paid psychiatric staff). However, the literature is limited on reports of burnout among informal caregivers and particularly within early psychosis groups. The current study sought to investigate reports of burnout in carers of young adults treated within a specialist early psychosis service and links with key appraisals reported about the illness and coping. Methods Seventy-two carers completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory along with self-report measures of coping styles and illness beliefs. Results Seventy-eight per cent of carers reported high burnout in {{at least one of the}} three key burnout markers (i. e. emotional exhaustion, depersonalization or low personal accomplishment). Seven per cent of carers met full criteria for high burnout across all the three domains. A carer's belief about the negative consequences of the illness for themselves was a significant predictor of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Low personal accomplishment was linked to a carer's less optimistic beliefs about the illness timeline and fewer reports of adaptive coping. Conclusions The results provide preliminary support for the importance of asking carers in the early illness phase about their experiences of caregiving. Targeted assessment may serve as a helpful tool to identify and intervene with carers in need of additional support with stress management, use of adaptive coping strategies, and <b>balanced</b> <b>recovery</b> focused information about psychosis...|$|E

40|$|Background. Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} that older adults have a reduced ability to recover balance with a single step after a forward-induced fall. To better understand {{the reasons for this}} reduced ability, this study investigated any age-related differences in peak joint torques during the support phase of a single-step <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> from a forward fall. Methods. Ten young (19 – 23 years old) and 10 older (65 – 83 years old) men were released from forward-leaning positions and attempted to recover their balance with a single step. Lean was increased until they failed to recover their balance with a single step. Peak extensor torques were calculated for the support phase of <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> and were compared across age groups. Results. A consistent pattern of joint torques emerged during the support phase of <b>balance</b> <b>recovery,</b> suggesting a similar strategy across young and older participants. Despite this similarity, older participants exhibited smaller peak knee extensor torques during the support phase of single-step <b>balance</b> <b>recoveries,</b> and trends toward larger peak extensor torques at the hip and ankle. Conclusions. The age-related differences found are believed to be the combined result of an age-related reduction in muscle strength and an age-related neuromuscular adaptation to mitigate the effects of muscle strength loss on physical performance capabilities.

40|$|Recently, {{interest}} in the mechanisms underlying <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> following stroke has grown, because insight into these mechanisms is necessary to develop effective rehabilitation strategies for different types of stroke. Studies dealing with the <b>recovery</b> of standing <b>balance</b> from stroke are, however, limited to rehabilitation inpatients with a unilateral supratentorial brain infarction or haemorrhage. In most of these patients, stance stability improves in both planes {{as well as the}} ability to compensate for external and internal body perturbations and to control posture voluntarily. Although there is evidence of true physiological recovery of paretic leg muscle functions in postural control, particularly during the first three months post-stroke, substantial <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> also occurs in patients when there are no clear signs of improved support functions or equilibrium reactions exerted through the paretic leg.

We tripped young subjects using an obstacle that suddenly appeared from the floor at exactly mid-swing. We measured arm muscle EMG, quantified body rotations after tripping, and established the effects of arm movements by calculating how the body would have rotated without arms. Strong asymmetric shoulder muscle responses were observed within 100 ms after trip initiation.

Mean amplitudes were larger in the ipsilateral retroflexors and contralateral anteflexors. The resulting asymmetric arm movements had a small effect on body rotation in the sagittal and frontal planes, but substantially affected the body orientation in the transverse plane. With the enlargement of the ongoing arm swing, the arms contributed to <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> by postponing the transfer of arm angular momentum to the trunk.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the adaptive <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> response exhibited by older adults following repeated exposure to forward loss of balance induced by releasing participants from a static forward lean angle. Fifty-eight healthy, community-dwelling older adults, aged 65 - 80 years, participated in the study. Participants were instructed to attempt to recover with a single step and performed four trials at each of three lean angles. Adaptive recovery responses at four events (cable release, toe-off of the stepping foot, foot contact and maximum knee flexion angle following landing in the stepping leg) were quantified for trials performed at the intermediate lean angle using the concept of margin of stability. The antero-posterior and medio-lateral margin of stability were computed as the difference between the velocity-adjusted position of the whole body centre of mass and the corresponding anterior or lateral boundary of the base of support. Across repeated trials adaptations in reactive stepping responses were detected that resulted in improved antero-posterior stability at foot contact and maximum knee flexion angle. Improved antero-posterior stability following repeated trials was explained by more effective control of the whole body centre of mass during the reactive stepping response and not by adjustments in step timing or base of support.

Eighty-one healthy, community dwelling adults aged 70 ± 3 participated. Loss of balance was induced by releasing participants from a static forward lean. Participants performed four trials at three initial lean magnitudes and were subsequently classified as single or multiple steppers.

There were no significant differences between older and younger adults in step length, step time, 3 D COM accelerations or muscle contributions to 3 D COM accelerations. The stance and stepping leg Gastrocnemius and Soleus muscles were primarily responsible for the vertical acceleration experienced by the COM. The Gastrocnemius and Soleus from the stance side leg together with bilateral Hamstrings accelerated the COM forwards throughout <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> while the Vasti and Soleus of the stepping side leg provided the majority of braking accelerations following foot contact. The Hip Abductor muscles provided the greatest contribution to medial-lateral accelerations of the COM. Deficits in the neuromuscular control of the Gastrocnemius, Soleus, Vasti and Hip Abductors in particular could adversely influence <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> and may be important targets in interventions to improve <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> performance...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 A {{backward}} fall is a {{major cause}} of hip fractures. Hip fractures have the potential to increase the mortality rate of older adults. Thus, the prevention of backward falls by older adults is a critical subject to be studied. Specifically, it remains unknown what effect aging-related losses in muscle strength have on the ability to recover balance by stepping following a backward loss of balance. There were two specific aims in this study. The first aim was to develop two-dimensional musculoskeletal models of young and older adults. The second aim was to quantify the effects of the normal aging-related loss in lower extremity strength on the ability to recover balance following a backward step from a backward balance loss by describing the feasible regions of <b>balance</b> <b>recovery.</b> Two-dimensional musculotendon models of young and older adults were developed and used in a six-link model to simulate backward <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> of young and older adults. The feasible regions for young and older adults were described for two combinations of initial backward and downward velocities: 15...|$|R
40|$|The three {{bio-inspired}} {{strategies that}} have been used for <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> of biped robots are the ankle, hip and stepping Strategies. However, there are several cases for a biped robot where stepping is not possible, e. g. when the available contact surfaces are limited. In this situation, the <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> by modulating the angular momentum of the upper body (Hip-strategy) or the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) (Ankle strategy) is essential. In this paper, a single Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme is employed for controlling the Capture Point (CP) to a desired position by modulating both the ZMP and the Centroidal Moment Pivot (CMP). The goal of the proposed controller is to control the CP, employing the CMP when the CP is out of the support polygon, and/or the ZMP when the CP is inside the support polygon. The proposed algorithm is implemented on an abstract model of the SURENA III humanoid robot. Obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the presence of severe pushes, even when the support polygon is shrunken to a point or a line...|$|R
40|$|Background: a fall {{occurs when}} an {{individual}} experiences a loss of balance from which {{they are unable to}} recover. Assessment of <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> ability in older adults may therefore help to identify individuals at risk of falls. The purpose of this 12 -month prospective study was to assess whether the ability to recover from a forward loss of balance with a single step across a range of lean magnitudes was predictive of falls...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{including the}} control of biological systems {{have the potential to}} play a major role in medical decision-making. Balance and walking are among the most challenging tasks for patients dealing with motor control deficits. Central nervous system (CNS) feedback control strategies are a combination of low-level spinal and high-level supraspinal control signals. Our objective was to design a controller based on the CNS to test simulation-based hypotheses related to <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> and movement control. Methods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The dynamics, stability, {{and control}} of {{stepping}} are considered. The role of internal models is elaborated. The main objective of the paper {{is to provide a}} better under-standing of the machinery and processing in the central nervous system (CNS) that relates to stepping. The role of the vestibu-lar system in <b>balance</b> and <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> is described. <b>Balance</b> and <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> are essential in stepping, and guarantee the stability of the system before, during, and after stepping. In sagit-tal standing, humans use two distinct sets of control strategies to maintain their postural stability in response to external dis-turbance. In one set of strategies, the configuration of the base of support, namely, the position of the feet, remains unchanged. The ankle and hip strategies are examples of postural adjustments where the feet do not move. When the disturbances are large, and move the center of mass or pressure outside the support bound-aries, stepping strategies are required. A simple control strategy is proposed for illustrative purposes. Its effectiveness is verified by computer simulation of a seven-link two-dimensional sagit-tal biped. The applications of the model in assessing trauma and injury are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Stepping {{is one of}} the {{predominant}} strategies to restore balance against an external perturbation. Although models have been proposed to estimate the recovery step placement for a given perturbation, they suffer from major limitations (step execution time usually neglected, no more than a single step recovery considered, etc.). The {{purpose of this study is}} to overcome these limitations and to develop a simple <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> model which can predict a complete multiple step recovery response. Inspired by the field of walking robots, we adapted a control scheme formerly proposed for biped robot locomotion. The scheme relies on a Linear Model Predictive Controller (LMPC) which estimates the best foot placements to zero the velocity of the Center of Mass (CoM), i. e. to reach a steady posture. The predicted step placements were compared against previously reported experimental data for tether- release conditions. They match correctly for various perturbation levels and both single step or multiple steps recovery. Although the current model still suffers from limitations (e. g., limited to the sagittal plane), these results demonstrate its ability to reproduce <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> reactions for different experimental scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the differences in moment demands on the stepping lower limb during the landing phase of recovery from a forward fall between older adults that could recover with a single step and those who could not, and to assess whether strength differences were a factor limiting the ability to recover. Eighty-five, older adults were released from a range of forward lean magnitudes. Data were collected using a 3 D motion analysis system and two force platforms. Isometric strength across a range of joint angles were assessed at the ankle, knee and hip joints using an isokinetic dynamometer. Peak hip extension torque during the landing phase was significantly lower in multiple compared to single steppers. Task specific measures of strength showed that multiple steppers were weaker at all joints compared to single steppers. Findings suggested that the lower limb joint angles adopted during the landing phase of <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> were not optimal for force generation. Proportional calculations of isometric strength at task specific angles relative to the moment demands during <b>balance</b> <b>recovery</b> revealed that strength may be limiting factor in the ability to recovery from a forward fall with a single step...|$|R
