40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper, {{we showed that}} the value of shadow prices depends on how the {{government}} contemplates re- equilibrating the economy to the perturbation associated with any project, except in the extreme case where the government has chosen all policy instruments optimally. Only under restrictive conditions will relative shadow prices for traded goods equal relative international prices. We develop here a general methodology for calculating shadow prices, which expresses the prices as a weighted average of domestic and international prices. The formulae provide the conditions under which the <b>border</b> <b>price</b> rule is valid. For instance, so long as there are non-traded goods, even if the government leaves tariffs unchanged (so that relative domestic prices of traded goods remain unchanged), unless the government completely neutralizes the induced change in domestic income, there will be changes in the prices of non-traded goods. These will preclude the use of the <b>border</b> <b>price</b> rule. ...|$|E

We develop general project evaluation rules that are more complex than the <b>border</b> <b>price</b> rule, but involve only one additional parameter, The evaluation of public expenditures is a central concern of development economics-and a concern highlighted by the increasingly stringent budget constraints in both developing and developed countries. This task has also become increasingly difficult as governments have moved their focus away from providing private, tradable, goods towards public goods that are provided either without charge, or at a charge considerably below their value to consumers...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} extent to which world market price changes are {{transmitted}} through changes in <b>border</b> <b>prices</b> into local producer prices for four agricultural product markets in Tanzania: sugar, cotton, wheat and rice. The changes in the marketing channels for each of these products resulting from market liberalization are described. The statistical analysis finds that, in general, Tanzanian border and world market prices for these products do not move closely together, although there is evidence that <b>border</b> <b>prices</b> are influenced by world market price levels but not vice versa. The absence of monthly price data at producer level for these products did not permit a detailed examination of the relationship between farmgate <b>prices</b> and either <b>border</b> <b>prices</b> or world market prices. However, the qualitative discussion suggests that the extent of price transmission is likely to be imperfect. These results have implications for the interpretation of simulation results modelling the potential impact of trade policy changes on Tanzanian producers and consumers. They also underline the need for concerted efforts by policy makers to reduce the extent of monopoly power in these marketing chains and to improve the degree of price transmission.

40|$|The article {{develops}} {{a method for}} decomposing changes in agricultural price gaps, defined as {{the difference between a}} commodity's domestic producer and <b>border</b> <b>prices.</b> We use OECD's procedure for decomposing changes in the market price support part of producer support estimates as the starting point for our decomposition method, and our method provides a basis for critiquing OECD's decomposition approach. The transmission of changes in <b>border</b> <b>prices</b> (world prices and the exchange rate) to domestic prices is a key element in the decomposition. The method is demonstrated using Russian agricultural price gaps. The results support the argument that for Russian agriculture during the transition period, the main cause of changes in price gaps has been incomplete transmission of changes in the exchange rate to domestic prices, and where the weak transmission results mainly not from policy intervention, but rather from deficient market conditions, in particular poor market infrastructure. The policy implication is that underdeveloped infrastructure has strongly limited the benefits to the Russian economy from agricultural trade liberalization.

We disaggregate cigarette advertising into (1) print, (2) outdoor, (3) entertainment and (4) store. How does advertising persist over time across advertising media? Are there differences in effectiveness of advertising across different smoking rates? Results show that the price elasticity of cigarette demand is negative and within the range of recent estimates, whereas <b>border</b> <b>price</b> elasticities and income elasticities are positive. All elasticities, however, are uniquely sensitive to smoking rates, as is the effectiveness of the Master Settlement Agreement. Current aggregate advertising increases cigarette demand, whereas accompanying negative advertising takes hold in the third year.

However, store advertising has a negative effect by the third year, especially in states with smoking rates at or above the median. Other advertising media have weak or no effects. ...|$|E

The supply side of the crop sector was modelled in a profit function framework to derive own and cross-price responses for the major crops grown in Zambia. The elasticity estimates derived indicated significant cross-price relationships among the major crops grown in Zambia. Increase (decrease) in the price of maize, for example, substantially reduces (increase) the production of all other crops and the use of fertilizer.;The results of the real and monetary impacts of selected pricing strategies that were considered did not give clear indication that 2 ̆ 7 <b>border</b> <b>pricing</b> 2 ̆ 7 strategy is a preferred pricing strategy compared to the existing price regime.

The objectives of maize self-sufficiency and agricultural export promotion are in direct conflict when maize price is used as policy instrument to achieve these objectives. Fertilizer subsidy, on the other hand, appears to be a desirable policy instrument for achieving both objectives simultaneously. However, it takes substantially larger changes in fertilizer subsidy relative to changes in the price of maize to achieve a given change in maize self-sufficiency...|$|R
