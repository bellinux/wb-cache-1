5|$|By {{the time}} the train reached Eccles, the day's drizzle had <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> storm. The doctors carried Huskisson, still on his door, off the train into a torrent of hail and thunder and walked the few hundred yards to the vicarage, {{frequently}} losing their footing as they climbed the deep cutting. Meanwhile, Stephenson and Wilton restarted the train {{and went on to}} Manchester to fetch medical assistance.|$|E
5|$|The launch was {{the first}} to use a newly {{developed}} high-performance motor for the solid rocket boosters, which gave approximately 7% greater thrust, and the second-last to use the original standard-mass steel casings for the boosters. These had <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> thinner case, saving some , on STS-6 and STS-7, but because of safety concerns the next two flights used the conventional cases.|$|E
5|$|A mugging {{at gunpoint}} in 1854 reputedly {{led to the}} {{establishment}} of a park police force. Until 2005 the park was policed by the separate Royal Parks Constabulary but that has now been subsumed into the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police. The mounted police have <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> patrol team in a four-wheel drive vehicle. In 2015 the Friends of Richmond Park expressed concern about plans to cut the numbers of police in the park to half the level that they were ten years previously, despite an increase in visitor numbers and in incidents of crime.|$|E

5|$|After López de Salcedo {{had been}} {{installed}} as governor, the emissaries {{that had been}} sent by Pedrarias arrived, expecting to find Saavedra. Although they did not dare to present Pedrarias' demands to a Crown representative, López de Salcedo had them imprisoned. When the Crown had appointed the new governor, it had not defined the limits of Honduras. Pedrarias had <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Crown representative in July 1526; this prompted López de Salcedo to claim jurisdiction over Nicaragua, based upon the actions of González Dávila and Hernán Cortés. He left a few men {{under the command of}} Francisco de Cisneros in Trujillo, and marched with 150 men to impose his authority over Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|All the {{criminal}} proceedings against him were canceled and {{the charges of}} blasphemy were officially withdrawn. Alcibiades was able to assert his piety and to raise Athenian morale by leading the solemn procession to Eleusis (for {{the celebration of the}} Eleusinian Mysteries) by land {{for the first time since}} the Spartans had occupied Decelea. The procession had <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> journey by sea, but this year Alcibiades used a detachment of soldiers to escort the traditional procession. His property was restored and the ecclesia elected him supreme commander of land and sea (strategos autokrator).|$|E
5|$|Another {{development}} was the Dreyer Fire-control Table that combined {{the functions of}} the Dumaresq and the range clock in the transmission stations. Hercules was probably fitted with a prototype table when its inventor, Commander Frederic Dreyer, was assigned to the ship at the end of 1911. The ship retained that instrument at least until February 1916, although it had <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Mark I table by 1918. Colossus received her Mark I table by early 1916.|$|E
25|$|Gradually, {{electrical}} reproduction {{entered the}} home. The spring motor <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> electric motor. The old sound box with its needle-linked diaphragm <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> electromagnetic pickup that converted the needle vibrations into an electrical signal. The tone arm now served {{to conduct a}} pair of wires, not sound waves, into the cabinet. The exponential horn <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> amplifier and a loudspeaker.|$|R

5|$|Benjamin F. Stapleton was {{the mayor}} of Denver, Colorado, for two periods, the first from 1923 to 1931 and the second from 1935 to 1947. Stapleton was {{responsible}} for many civic improvements, notably during his second stint as mayor when he had access to funds and manpower from the New Deal. During this time, the park system was considerably expanded and the Civic Center completed. His signature project was the construction of Denver Municipal Airport, which began in 1929 amidst heavy criticism. It was later renamed Stapleton International Airport in his honor. Today, the airport has <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> neighborhood also named Stapleton. Stapleton Street continues to bear his name.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{this loss}} of sponsorship, Davies {{completed}} his studies and graduated in 1913. His plans to enter the ministry were abandoned; he was {{an active member of}} the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and his religious vocation had <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> commitment to working-class politics. In 1913, while still a student, he stood for election to Cardiff's Board of Guardians, as the ILP candidate in the Grangetown ward. This first foray into electoral politics ended in a narrow defeat, by 47 votes.|$|E
5|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{encouraged the}} growth of young coniferous trees, such as ponderosa pine and incense cedar; adult conifers create enough shade to inhibit {{the growth of}} young black oak trees. By the 20thcentury, fire suppression and the lowering of water tables by draining swamps led {{to the establishment of}} dense conifer forests where mixed and open conifer-oak woodlands had previously grown. Fire suppression polices have <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> fire management program which includes the annual use of prescribed fires. Fire is especially important to the giant sequoia groves, whose seeds cannot germinate without fire-touched soil.|$|E

50|$|In 1878 {{a series}} of large Beer Duty stamps portraying Queen Victoria was issued. These <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{rectangular}} design in 1885, again with the Queen's portrait.

5|$|On its route southwards, {{the river}} passes the former {{junction}} with Aike Beck, once navigable to Lockington Landing, but the stream was subsequently re-routed {{to join the}} Arram Beck. The Leven Canal used to join on the east bank, but the entrance lock has <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> sluice. The Arram Beck flows in from the west, and then the river is crossed by Hull Bridge, the cause of repeated disagreement between {{the owners of the}} Driffield Navigation and the Corporation of Beverley, who owned the bridge. Just above Beverley Beck, which joins from the west, is Grovehill Bridge, now a lift bridge but once a ferry bridge.|$|E
5|$|The Crucifixion {{itself is}} conspicuously absent, {{and there is}} no trace or shadow of its {{presence}} in the panels. Writing in 1996, Wieland Schmied noted that the three Furies have replaced Christ and the two thieves crucified on either side of him. The form of the Furies is borrowed directly from Picasso's late 1920s and mid-1930s pictures of biomorphs on beaches, in particular from the Spanish artist's The Bathers (1937). However, the eroticism and comedy of Picasso's figures have <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> sense of menace and terror derived in part from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ.|$|E
5|$|There was a wharf on {{the river}} in 1874, served by a railway line, and sidings which were used to collect shingle. By 1909, the wharf had <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> landing stage {{slightly}} further downstream, which was also served by the railway. As it nears the sea, a Martello tower, built in 1806 to protect against French invasion, stands {{to the west of}} the channel. It is numbered 28, and was one of many such structures built at the time. Nearby is an Inshore Rescue station, run by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution The river then enters Rye Bay, part of the English Channel.|$|E
50|$|The clock {{underwent}} restoration in 1995. The master clock's {{quartz crystal}} <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> radio clock, and the tape recorders <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> compact disc player. Without funding for maintenance, the clock has been stopped since July 1, 2003.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, a 30th Anniversary Edition {{was added}} to all models, {{as well as a}} Sport model for sedans. In 2004, the DX model <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Special Edition (SE) model and the {{previous}} Sport model <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> LX-G trim.|$|R
50|$|The small {{building}} {{from the beginning}} of the 18th century <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> larger building in 1933. Meyercrones Stiftelse was later merged with Duebrødre Kloster. The old building <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> new and larger one with four apartments in 1832.|$|R
5|$|US Marines {{conducted}} an amphibious landing at Cape Torokina, {{on the western}} coast of Bougainville, north of Empress Augusta Bay, in November 1943. After an initial counter-attack that was repulsed, the Marines had <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> garrison of US Army troops who began consolidating their position around Torokina, establishing a strong perimeter. In March 1944, the Japanese launched a heavy counter-attack, which was turned back with many casualties. After this, the situation on Bougainville became largely static, as the Japanese focused primarily on subsistence, and the US forces chose to adopt a mostly defensive posture aimed at maintaining the perimeter around Torokina.|$|E
5|$|Under Childeric's son Clovis I (r. 509–511), {{the founder}} of the Merovingian dynasty, the Frankish kingdom {{expanded}} and converted to Christianity. The Britons, related to the natives of Britannia – modern-day Great Britain – settled in what is now Brittany. Other monarchies were established by the Visigothic Kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula, the Suebi in northwestern Iberia, and the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa. In the sixth century, the Lombards settled in Northern Italy, replacing the Ostrogothic kingdom with a grouping of duchies that occasionally selected a king to rule over them all. By the late sixth century, this arrangement had <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> permanent monarchy, the Kingdom of the Lombards.|$|E
5|$|A second bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund for the {{connection}} from Stonehouse to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal at Saul was rejected in 2007. This section presents some engineering challenges, {{as it was}} severed by {{the construction of the}} M5 motorway and the A38 road. The roundabout where the A38 joins the A419 road was built over Bristol Road Lock, and part of the route was destroyed by flood relief work for the River Frome. At Stonehouse, the bridge carrying the Bristol and Gloucester Railway has <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> culvert, but a bid has been made to the newly formed Gloucestershire Local Transport Board for its reinstatement, and to create a long-distance footpath along the route. Outside of the main restoration, the Cotswold Canals Trust are gradually restoring many of the other structures, with the ultimate goal of re-opening a link between the River Thames and the River Severn.|$|E
5000|$|The {{equivalent}} resistance Rth is the resistance that the circuit between terminals A and B {{would have if}} all ideal voltage sources in the circuit <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> short circuit and all ideal current sources <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> open circuit.|$|R
50|$|The OFC-3 {{system is}} modular design that {{comprises}} a laser range finder, a color TV camera, and an IR camera, and the laser range finder can <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> laser designator (for a laser beam-riding SAM), the TV camera can <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> night vision camera, and the IR camera can <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> ImIR, at higher cost.

50|$|Her {{armament}} {{was changed}} in 1856, {{when one of}} the 10-inch guns <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> 68-pounder (95 cwt) gun, and the 25 cwt 32-pounders <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> with 42 cwt versions.

5|$|Central Province is {{considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} national movement of Zambia. The United National Independence Party (UNIP) was founded in Kabwe by Kenneth Kaunda, who later became the first President of Zambia and remained in office from 1964 to 1991. The provincial capital is Kabwe, home of the Mulungushi Rock of Authority. This is a historic site, an isolated flat-topped hill, where in 1960, UNIP met for the first time, away from the eye of the colonial administration. It is still used for political gatherings, but the open air assemblies have <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> conference centre built nearby at Mulungushi University. Mulungushi is the name of a river in the province and many historical policies, buildings and organizations are named after it. The 1968 Mulungushi Declaration proclaimed the country as a socialist nation. Mulungushi Hall in the capital is the venue for most international conventions. The city of Kapiri Mposhi was a historic site during the post-colonial era fight against White minorities.|$|E
5|$|Following a major {{refurbishment}} of the Bridge Street {{base in the}} mid-1960s, the next milestones for the paper came in 1973. The first was Sunderland A.F.C.'s 1–0 win over Leeds United in the FA Cup Final. Ian Porterfield's winning goal was headline news at the time, giving the Echo its all-time record circulation figure of 95,000copies of the Sports Echo. The second important event of 1973 was the 100th anniversary of the paper. Celebrations included a birthday party, with dignitaries such as Sunderland A.F.C. manager Bob Stokoe among the guests. Lord Buckton, the chairman of Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers Ltd, announced his retirement at the event, and was succeeded by his son, The Honourable Richard Storey. News of a move from Bridge Street to Pennywell, Sunderland, was also announced during the anniversary celebrations. The old newspaper building has since <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> modern apartment block. The Echo name still lives on, however, as the project as been named Echo24.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, a five-gondola {{train set}} with green-and-white-striped awnings and a five-gondola train set with blue-and-white-striped awnings, {{referred}} to by Disneyland employees as Holiday Green and Holiday Blue respectively, {{were added to the}} DRR's rolling stock. Both train sets had side-facing bench seating like the Holiday Red freight train. By the time that the new Holiday Green and Holiday Blue trains sets were introduced in 1966, the DRR's original roundhouse, located {{on the end of a}} spur line connected to the main line near the Rivers of America in the Frontierland section, had <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> larger roundhouse, located on the end of a new spur line connected to the main line in the Tomorrowland section. The new roundhouse, where the DRR's locomotives and train cars are stored and maintained, was also built to house the storage and maintenance facility for the Disneyland Monorail.|$|E
5|$|During the ship's refit in January 1944, her {{electronics}} were modernized. The CXAM <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> SK {{model and}} the SC-1 <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> SC-3. The forward SG was supplemented <b>by</b> <b>an</b> additional SG-1 mounted on a short mast at the aft end of the funnel. A lengthier overhaul in mid-1944 provided the opportunity to revise the radar arrangements. The SK radar {{was moved to the}} rebuilt foremast and the forward SG radar <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> SG-1 mounted {{at the top of the}} foremast. An SM-1 fighter-control radar was mounted in the SK's former position and new antennas were added to the FD radars to allow them to determine target height.
