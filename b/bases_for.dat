5|$|Cheney {{persuaded the}} Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to allow <b>bases</b> <b>for</b> U.S. ground troops and war {{planes in the}} nation. This was an {{important}} element {{of the success of the}} Gulf War, as well as a lightning-rod for Islamists, such as Osama bin Laden, who opposed having non-Muslim armies near their holy sites.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, {{upon the}} {{recommendation}} of Secretary of the Air Force Donald B. Rice, identified Loring and five other SAC <b>bases</b> <b>for</b> closure through the BRAC Commission. The commission recommended that the 42d Bomb Wing be disestablished, and the B-52Gs transferred to the 410th Bomb Wing at K.I. Sawyer AFB near Marquette, Michigan. The KC-135 aircraft were realigned to USAF Reserve and other active units.|$|E
5|$|In April 1986 she {{permitted}} US F-111s to use Royal Air Force <b>bases</b> <b>for</b> {{the bombing}} of Libya {{in retaliation for the}} alleged Libyan bombing of a Berlin discothèque, citing the right of self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Polls suggested that fewer than one in three British citizens approved of her decision.|$|E
2500|$|Amendola Air Base was {{primarily}} a training <b>base</b> <b>for</b> pilots of the AMX International AMX ground attack aircraft and the main <b>base</b> <b>for</b> Italy for AMX pilots.|$|R
50|$|In ancient Mesopotamia, the <b>base</b> <b>for</b> {{constructing}} numbers was 60, with 10 used as {{an intermediate}} <b>base</b> <b>for</b> numbers below 60.|$|R

5|$|In October 2014, MART {{announced}} that it would run dedicated bus service from Gardner to Wachusett station when the station opened. By the end of 2014, retaining walls for ramps to the platforms and concrete <b>bases</b> <b>for</b> light poles in the parking lot were in place. Track and signal work on the Pan Am Southern mainline began in Spring 2015. In January 2015, the opening was delayed further to Fall 2016.|$|E
5|$|Japanese forces first {{landed on}} the {{mainland}} of New Guinea on 8 March 1942 when they invaded Lae and Salamaua to secure <b>bases</b> <b>for</b> the defence of the important base they were developing at Rabaul. Australian guerrillas from the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles established observation posts around the Japanese beachheads and the 2/5th Independent Company successfully raided Salamaua on 29 June.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{relations}} between Edward and Llywelyn rapidly collapsed, leading to Edward invading North Wales in 1276 {{in an attempt}} to break Llywelyn's hold on power. During the war Edward built several major castles in order to better control the region and act as <b>bases</b> <b>for</b> campaigning. Edward was successful, and the Treaty of Aberconwy in 1277 reaffirmed English dominance, dividing up most of Llwelyn's lands amongst his brothers and Edward.|$|E
50|$|In steam {{days the}} depot was called Cardiff Canton and its shed code was 86C. It {{was built in}} 1882 as the main {{maintenance}} <b>base</b> <b>for</b> the South Wales Railway and the major Welsh engineering <b>base</b> <b>for</b> the Great Western Railway (GWR). After nationalisation in 1948 it was a heavy overhaul <b>base</b> <b>for</b> British Railways.|$|R
50|$|William Coaker {{founded the}} town as the <b>base</b> <b>for</b> the Fishermen's Protective Union in 1917. It was the <b>base</b> <b>for</b> the {{publication}} of the Fishermen's Advocate journal.|$|R
50|$|West Field was a <b>base</b> <b>for</b> Twentieth Air Force B-29 Superfortress {{operations}} against the Japanese Home Islands in 1944-5, and the <b>base</b> <b>for</b> the B-29 Superfortress 58th Bombardment Wing.|$|R
5|$|On 7 August 1942, Allied forces (primarily U.S.) {{landed on}} Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands. The {{objective}} was to deny the islands to the Japanese as <b>bases</b> <b>for</b> threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia, and secure starting points for a campaign to isolate the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign. The Guadalcanal campaign would last six months.|$|E
5|$|The third {{industrial}} revolution is spreading from {{the developed world}} to some, but not all, parts of the developing world. To participate in this new global economy, developing countries {{must be seen as}} attractive offshore production <b>bases</b> <b>for</b> multinational corporations. To be such bases, developing countries must provide relatively well-educated workforces, good infrastructure (electricity, telecommunications, transportation), political stability, and a willingness to play by market rules.|$|E
5|$|The trihalides adopt a planar {{trigonal}} structure. These compounds are Lewis {{acids in}} that they readily form adducts with electron-pair donors, which are called Lewis <b>bases.</b> <b>For</b> example, fluoride (F−) and boron trifluoride (BF3) combined to give the tetrafluoroborate anion, BF4−. Boron trifluoride {{is used in the}} petrochemical industry as a catalyst. The halides react with water to form boric acid.|$|E
50|$|As {{the goal}} by 2010, KUST {{was to become}} a key {{university}} with a strong science and engineering background. The university is to be developed into an important provincial training <b>base</b> <b>for</b> advanced technical personnel, a research <b>base</b> <b>for</b> applied fundamental research and hi-tech research, an industrialization <b>base</b> <b>for</b> hi-tech, and a research and consulting center for the national social and economic development.|$|R
5000|$|Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport - Primary <b>base</b> <b>for</b> Airbus A319, and A321 aircraft, Boeing 777 and 787 aircraft, {{secondary}} <b>base</b> <b>for</b> Boeing 737, 757, 767, and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|RAAF Tindal near Katherine, Northern Territory, was {{maintained}} as a Bare <b>Base</b> <b>for</b> {{a number of}} years before being upgraded in 1988 to a permanent operational <b>base</b> <b>for</b> No. 75 Squadron's F/A-18s.|$|R
5|$|A major {{capital works}} program was also {{undertaken}} to prepare RAAF <b>bases</b> <b>for</b> the Hornets. Over $150 million was spent upgrading the runways, hangars and maintenance facilities at RAAF Base Williamtown, {{which has been}} the main F/A-18 base throughout the aircraft's service. The pre-existing airfield at RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory was also developed into a major air base between 1985 and 1988 at a cost of $215 million so that it could accommodate No.75 Squadron. Until this time the squadron had been stationed at RAAF Base Darwin which, due to its location on Australia's north coast, was vulnerable to damage from cyclones and difficult to defend during wartime.|$|E
5|$|Luttwak terminates his {{analysis}} {{at the end}} of Constantine's reign, before the establishment of the diocesan comitatus. Unlike the imperial escort-armies, these were close enough to the theatre of operations to succour the border troops. But their stationing may have differed little from the location of legions in the 2nd century, even though they apparently wintered inside cities, rather than in purpose-built legionary <b>bases.</b> <b>For</b> example, the two comitatus of Illyricum (East and West) are documented as wintering in Sirmium, which was the site of a major legionary base in the Principate.|$|E
5|$|Musial {{accomplished}} another historical feat on May 2, 1954, in a doubleheader in St. Louis {{against the}} New York Giants: he hit three {{home runs in}} the first contest, then added two more in the second {{to become the first}} major leaguer to hit five home runs in a doubleheader. In addition to his five home runs, he also hit a single in the first game, setting a new record of 21 total <b>bases</b> <b>for</b> a doubleheader. The only player besides Musial to hit five home runs in a doubleheader is Nate Colbert, who achieved the feat in 1972.|$|E
50|$|Material and {{technical}} base of faculty has 24 classrooms and 38 specialized laboratories. Since 1997, the department operates accredited test center products, {{which is the}} material <b>base</b> <b>for</b> scientific research and commodity training <b>base</b> <b>for</b> the preparation of commodity experts. Since 2009, the faculty is 2 new laboratories - Laboratory-equipped lab and confectionery that are educational <b>base</b> <b>for</b> training in hotel and restaurant business.|$|R
50|$|In {{some cases}} it is more {{convenient}} to use a <b>base</b> <b>for</b> the closed sets rather than the open ones. For example, a space is completely regular if and only if the zero sets form a <b>base</b> <b>for</b> the closed sets. Given any topological space X, the zero sets form the <b>base</b> <b>for</b> the closed sets of some topology on X. This topology will be the finest completely regular topology on X coarser than the original one. In a similar vein, the Zariski topology on An is defined by taking the zero sets of polynomial functions as a <b>base</b> <b>for</b> the closed sets.|$|R
50|$|During the Cold War, Dreux-Louvilliers was a front-line <b>base</b> <b>for</b> the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). Sparingly used by USAFE {{and kept}} mostly in reserve status, {{it was used}} {{primarily}} as a tactical transport <b>base</b> <b>for</b> theater operations by the 60th Troop Carrier Wing in the late 1950s, and as a <b>base</b> <b>for</b> deployed Air National Guard tactical reconnaissance aircraft during the Berlin Crisis of 1961.|$|R
5|$|On 29 October 1968, {{work was}} {{stopped on the}} {{physical}} SPOS barrier, by that time redesignated as Duel Blade, under MACV Planning Directive 10–67, citing changes in the overall force posture, both enemy and friendly. The physical barrier would {{be replaced by the}} revised Duel Blade plan of active resistance utilizing air strikes, artillery and naval bombardment and mobile reaction forces. Base sites already constructed or under construction were to be used as support <b>bases</b> <b>for</b> the revised operation plan.|$|E

5|$|Several agencies, {{including}} the Federal Highway Administration and the City of Oklahoma City have evaluated the emergency response actions to the bombing, and have proposed {{plans for a}} better response in addition to addressing issues that hindered a smooth rescue effort. Because of the crowded streets, {{and the number of}} response agencies sent to the location, communication between government branches and rescue workers was muddled. Groups were unaware of the operations others were conducting, thus creating strife and delays in the search and rescue process. The City of Oklahoma City, in their After Action Report, declared that better communication and single <b>bases</b> <b>for</b> agencies would better the aid of those in disastrous situations.|$|E
5|$|Speaking is {{the default}} {{modality}} for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other {{components of the}} vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language. The study of the genetic <b>bases</b> <b>for</b> human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated in language production is FOXP2, which may cause a kind of congenital language disorder if affected by mutations.|$|E
50|$|Keesler AFB was {{the primary}} {{training}} <b>base</b> <b>for</b> many avionics maintenance career fields including Electronic Warfare, Navigational Aids, Computer Repair and Ground Radio Repair.
