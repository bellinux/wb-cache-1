25|$|UCLA has {{attracted}} filming for decades with {{its proximity to}} Hollywood. Much of the film Gotcha! (1985) was shot at UCLA, as well as John Singleton's Higher Learning (1995). Legally Blonde (2001), Old School (2003), The Nutty Professor (1995), Erin Brockovich (2000), How High (2001), National Lampoon's Van Wilder (2002), American Pie 2 (2001), and <b>Bring</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> Again (2004) were all mainly shot around campus. In January 2009, the Bollywood movie My Name is Khan (2010) was shot at UCLA. UCLA is also often cast as Stanford in television shows such as The Mindy Project and Chuck. Some of the exterior shots of the fictional UC Sunnydale in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and ABC Family original series Greek were also filmed at UCLA. In response to the major demand for filming, UCLA has instated a policy to regulate filming and professional photography at the campus.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Dunst {{starred in}} the comedy <b>Bring</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> as Torrance Shipman, the captain of a cheerleading squad. The film {{generated}} mostly positive reviews, with many critics reserving praise for her performance. In his review, A. O. Scott called her [...] "a terrific comic actress, largely because of her great expressive range, and the nimbleness with which she can shift from anxiety to aggression to genuine hurt." [...] Charles Taylor of Salon noted that [...] "among contemporary teenage actresses, Dunst has become the sunniest imaginable parodist", even though he thought the film had failed to provide her with as good a role as she had either in Dick or in The Virgin Suicides. Jessica Winter from The Village Voice complimented Dunst, stating that her performance was [...] "as sprightly and knowingly daft as her turn in Dick" [...] and commenting that [...] " [...] provides the only major element of <b>Bring</b> <b>It</b> <b>On</b> that plays as tweaking parody rather than slick, strident, body-slam churlishness." [...] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle, despite giving the film an unfavorable review, commended Dunst for her willingness [...] "to be as silly and cloyingly agreeable {{as it takes to}} get through a slapdash film." ...|$|E

Describing the film's score, Beck said, [...] "For Ant-Man, I {{wanted to write a}} score in the grand symphonic tradition of my favorite superhero movies, with a sweeping scope and a big, catchy main theme.

Beginning in the 1830s, Russian intelligentsia debated {{the issue of whether}} artists negated their Russianness when they borrowed from European culture or took vital steps toward renewing and developing Russian culture. Two groups sought to answer this question. Slavophiles idealized Russian history before Peter the Great and claimed the country possessed a distinct culture, rooted in Byzantium and spread by the Russian Orthodox Church. The Zapadniki ("Westernizers"), on the other hand, lauded Peter as a patriot who wanted to reform his country and <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> a par with Europe. Looking forward instead of backward, they saw Russia as a youthful and inexperienced but with the potential of becoming the most advanced European civilization by borrowing from Europe and turning its liabilities into assets.|$|E
