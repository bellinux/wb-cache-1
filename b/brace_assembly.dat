50|$|When {{the barbed}} wire span exceeds 650 ft, a braced line {{assembly}} is added in-line. This has the function of a corner post and <b>brace</b> <b>assembly</b> but handles tension from opposite sides. It uses diagonal brace wire that connects the tops to the bottoms of all adjacent posts.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} the solar sail principle {{as an effective}} means of space propulsion. The heliogyro configuration is discussed including the hub structures, the flap-hinge <b>brace</b> <b>assembly,</b> and the blade. The material requirements of the sail film made of metallized polymers, the tendons produced from a polymer-graphite fiber composite, and battens constructed of graphite/epoxy tubings are considered, noting that not all of these materials were readily available. It was concluded that the primary material problems are the environmental degradation of polymer films, the meteoroid hazard, and the production capacity for large polymer film quantities...|$|E
40|$|The modular {{components}} of an orthopedic leg <b>brace</b> <b>assembly</b> are secured together around a flexible cable arrangement and the components are removable {{so that they}} may be dissambled for repair or for replacement with longer components to accommodate for a user's growth. The components inlcude an ankle-foot orthosis and upwardly extending side braces of stanchion form with an upper securing strap arrangement for securely surrounding a user's lower leg, a second pair of side braces of stanchion form with an upper securing strap arrangement for securely surrounding a user's thigh, and knee joint assemblies joining the ends of the braces to simulate the normal action of a user's knee during flexion and extension of the leg. The flexible cable arrangement allows the user to rigidly hold the entire unit in aligned, fixed relation when the leg is extended. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} and most time-consuming part of a barbed wire fence is constructing the corner post and the <b>bracing</b> <b>assembly.</b> A barbed wire fence is under tremendous tension, often up to half a ton, and so the corner post's sole function is to resist the tension of the fence spans connected to it. The bracing keeps the corner post vertical and prevents slack from developing in the fence.|$|R
50|$|Anchor {{plates are}} made of cast iron, {{sometimes}} wrought iron or steel, and are often used on brick or other masonry-based buildings. They are easy to find in cities with substantial legacies of 18th- and 19th-century brick construction, such as New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Cincinnati and Charleston, South Carolina, and in older earthquake prone cities such as San Francisco, as well as across all of Europe. The tie-rod-and-plate <b>assembly</b> <b>braces</b> the masonry wall against lateral bowing.|$|R
40|$|Co-receptors add {{complexity}} to cell-cell signaling systems. The secreted semaphorin 3 s (Sema 3 s) {{require a}} co-receptor, neuropilin (Nrp), to signal through plexin As (PlxnAs) in functions ranging from axon guidance to bone homeostasis, but {{the role of}} the co-receptor is obscure. Here we present the low-resolution crystal structure of a mouse semaphorin-plexin-Nrp complex alongside unliganded component structures. Dimeric semaphorin, two copies of plexin and two copies of Nrp are arranged as a dimer of heterotrimers. In each heterotrimer subcomplex, semaphorin contacts plexin, similar to in co-receptor-independent signaling complexes. The Nrp 1 s cross <b>brace</b> the <b>assembly,</b> bridging between sema domains of the Sema 3 A and PlxnA 2 subunits from the two heterotrimers. Biophysical and cellular analyses confirm that this Nrp binding mode stabilizes a canonical, but weakened, Sema 3 -PlxnA interaction, adding co-receptor control over the mechanism by which receptor dimerization and/or oligomerization triggers signaling.

40|$|Experimental {{tests were}} {{performed}} to study the seismic behavior and performance of modified steel chevron braced frame systems, which incorporate a vertical slotted connection (VSC) detail between {{the top of the}} braces and the floor beam above. The VSC detail is intended to prevent vertical load transfer to the beam and limit brace forces to the compressive resistance of the members. Full-scale quasi-static cyclic tests were performed on two specimens with hollow tube braces, with one specimen having the braces filled with concrete. Both frames exhibited stable, predictable behavior under cyclic loading. The VSC detail provided free vertical movement of the <b>brace</b> <b>assembly</b> during both tests. However, its flexibility created a moderate reduction in the overall lateral stiffness of the frame. The concrete-filled tube specimen sustained higher peak loads, demonstrated greater residual strength and dissipated more energy than the hollow tube specimen due to the partial inhibition of local buckling by the concrete core. It was found that the VSC chevron braced frame system is a suitable concept for use in buildings in high-risk seismic zones...|$|E
