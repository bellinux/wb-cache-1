25|$|A <b>boattail</b> {{can greatly}} reduce a vehicle's total drag. Boattails create a {{teardrop}} shape {{that will give}} the vehicle a more streamlined profile, reducing the occurrence of drag inducing flow separation. A kammback is a truncated <b>boattail.</b> It is created {{as an extension of}} the rear of the vehicle, moving the rear backward at a slight angle toward the bumper of the car. This can reduce drag as well but a <b>boattail</b> would reduce the vehicles drag more. Nonetheless, for practical and style reasons, a kammback is more commonly seen in racing, high efficiency vehicles, and trucking.|$|E
500|$|The CQC-7 {{is similar}} in size and blade profile to the CQC-6 with the main {{difference}} being a rear brake at {{the butt of the}} handle of the CQC-7 as opposed to the <b>boattail</b> shape of the CQC-6. After the contract with Benchmade expired, Emerson began production of this model in his own factory, Emerson Knives, Inc., in 1999. The production version of the CQC7 is not a handmade knife and features no bolsters or micarta in the handle construction. The handle material on the production model is G-10 fiberglass and the edge of the blade has a secondary bevel. There is a larger and smaller version of this knife known as the [...] "Super CQC-7" [...] and [...] "Mini-CQC-7", respectively and a version with a drop-point blade as opposed to a tanto. An [...] "all titanium" [...] handled version with a framelock was made in 2005 known as the HD-7 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of this model. Emerson makes handmade versions of the CQC-7 with variations similar to the CQC-6 mentioned above.|$|E

Preliminary calculations were restricted to a particular model configuration which had been tested in an experimental program.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} to predict the effects of forebody and afterbody shapes on the aerodynamic characteristics of several projectile bodies at supersonic speeds using analytical methods combined with semi-empirical design curves. The considered projectile bodies had a length-to-diameter ratio of 6. 67 and included three variations of forebody shape and three variations of afterbody shape. The results, which are verified by comparison with available experimental data, indicated that the lowest drag was achieved with a cone-cylinder at the considered Mach number range. It is also shown that the drag can be reduced by <b>boattailing</b> the afterbody. The centre-of-pressure assumed a slightly rearward location for the ogive-cylinder configuration when compared to the configuration with <b>boattailed</b> afterbody where it was the most forward. With the exception of the <b>boattailed</b> afterbody, all the bodies indicated inherent static stability above Mach number 2 for a centre-of-gravity location at about 40 % from the body nose...|$|R

40|$|Full Navier-Stokes {{simulations}} around axisymmetric <b>boattailed</b> and flared rockets are numerically {{investigated for}} plume induced separation phenomenon. At lower altitudes, the plume {{interaction with the}} external flow does not cause any flow separation on the body, but at conditions corresponding to higher altitudes large plume induced separation is observed. Addition of a flare to the afterbody limits the extent of separation at high altitudes. Computational solutions for the <b>boattailed</b> axisymmetric geometry are compared with available wind-tunnel and flight data. The effect of forebody ablation is studied by modifying the inflow boundary layer profile. Numerical solutions with thicker boundary layers show significantly greater plume-induced separation compared with nonablating cases.

Body-normal coordinates {{are used in the}} nose region and sheared cylindrical coordinates are used on the afterbody to accommodate corners such as <b>boattails</b> and flares. An improved difference scheme is used which does not require that the flow be nearly alined with a coordinate direction in supersonic regions, and which treats either subsonic or supersonic free streams. Numerical results are illustrated for some simple classical shapes such as spheres and ellipsoids, and for more practical shapes like tangent-ogives with <b>boattails.</b> Special attention is given to bodies which have been studied for area-rule applications.

40|$|A wind-tunnel {{investigation}} {{of the effects of}} both <b>boattailing</b> and nozzle extension on the thrust-minus-drag of clustered-jet configurations has been conducted at Mach numbers from 0. 60 to 1. 40 and jet total-pressure ratios from 3 to 20. Three different <b>boattails</b> were tested: an 8 deg conical afterbody, a 16 deg circular-arc afterbody, and a third afterbody having a linear area variation with length. A cylindrical afterbody also was tested for comparison purposes. Extending from these bodies are four circular jet nozzles with a design Mach number of 2. 5 which were spaced symmetrically about the body center line. The results indicated that an 8 deg conical afterbody provided the highest net thrust efficiency factors of the four models tested when the nozzle exits were at the optimum longitudinal location in each case. The other afterbodies in order of decreasing performance were the 16 deg circular-arc, the straight-line-area-distribution, and the cylindrical...|$|R

2500|$|The {{initial test}} {{model of the}} Polaris was {{referred}} to as the AX series and made its maiden flight from Cape Canaveral on September 24, 1958. The missile failed to perform its pitch and roll maneuver and instead just flew straight up, however the flight was considered a partial success (at that time, [...] "partial success" [...] was used for any missile test that returned usable data). The next flight on October 15 failed spectacularly when the second stage ignited on the pad and took off by itself. Range Safety blew up the errant rocket while the first stage sat on the pad and burned. The third and fourth tests (December 30 and January 9) had problems due to overheating in the <b>boattail</b> section. This necessitated adding extra shielding and insulation to wiring and other components. When the final AX flight was conducted a year after the program began, 17 Polaris missiles had been flown of which five met all of their test objectives.|$|E

40|$|The AP 05 {{code was}} {{evaluated}} {{when applied to}} configurations with <b>boattails.</b> Results of the evaluation indicated the AP 05 predictions for normal force, center of pressure, pitch and roll damping moments needed improvement. As a result new and improved methods were developed and incorporated into the AP 05 to be released as the AP 09. Improvements include body alone lift characteristics for Mach numbers less than 2, low angle of attack improvements for roll and pitch damping for configurations with long <b>boattails,</b> incorporation of an improved boundary layer displacement model and refinement of several other existing methods. In addition, new methods were developed to predict nonlinear roll and pitch damping. Comparing the new and improved methods to existing experimental data indicated significant improvements in roll and pitch damping, normal force and center of pressure predictions compared to the AP 05. However, validation of the AP 09 code was not as complete as desired due to limited generic nonlinear roll and pitch damping data. Also, most of the available nonlinear dynamic derivative data has larger than desired accuracy boundaries due to model sting and wind tunnel wall interference issues.
