40|$|Pendimethalin and {{trifluralin}} are current-use pesticides {{that have}} been previously reported as persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic. In the studies presented here, dissipation of aged and fresh residues of pendimethalin and trifluralin were evaluated in soil, {{as well as the}} <b>bioavailability</b> <b>of</b> <b>residues</b> to earthworms and the movement of pendimethalin in a soil column. In a separate study, pond water receiving runoff from a golf course was measured for the presence of pendimethalin. Dissipation measurements of pendimethalin and trifluralin in soil indicated very slow dissipation with 40 - 60 % of the compounds extractable at 1026 days after the first measurement. In a second study, dissipation of pendimethalin was more rapid, however more than 30 % was present after 310 days of soil treatment. Biovailability, as measured by earthworm biological accumulation factors, was reduced over time. Mobility of pendimethalin was very limited. Almost no downward movement was measured in the column study, and no detectable levels were found in runoff from turf grass...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} pesticide mixtures on degradation patterns of parent compounds as well as effects on soil microbial respiration. <b>Bioavailability</b> <b>of</b> <b>residues</b> to sensitive plant species was also determined. Soil for this study was obtained from a pesticide‐contaminated area within an agrochemical dealer site. Degradation patterns were not affected by the presence or absence of other herbicides in this study. Atrazine concentrations were significantly lower at 21 through 160 days aging time compared to day 0 concentrations. Metolachlor and pendimethalin concentrations were not significantly different over time and remained high throughout the study. Microbial respiration was suppressed in treated soils from day 21 to day 160. Soybean and canola were the most successful plant species in the germination and survival tests. Generally, with increased aging of pesticides in soil, germination time decreased. Survival time of plants increased over time for some treatments indicating possible decreased bioavailability of pesticide residues. In some cases, survival time decreased at the longer 160 ‐day aging period, possibly indicating a change in bioavailability, perhaps as the result of formation of more bioavailable and phytotoxic metabolites. No interactive effects were noted for mixtures of pesticides compared to individually applied pesticides in terms of degradation of the parent compound or on seed germination, plant survival, or microbial respiration...|$|E

40|$|The {{rationale}} for adopting {{a new approach}} to the field testing of potential soil termiticides is advocated on the grounds that current testing methods are limited to termite bioassays and do not address quantitatively the persistence and <b>bioavailability</b> <b>of</b> soil termiticides to foraging subterranean termites over time and in different soil types. Furthermore, the present testing regimes assume field situations of uniform high termite hazard across field sites. Our testing procedures require the random sampling of soil cores from test soil pads (500 × 500 mm) at several geographically different locations. The soil cores from treated and untreated soil pads are returned to the laboratory and half of the samples chemically analyzed using a chromatographic method (HPLC) examined for each year of test period. The <b>bioavailability</b> <b>of</b> termiticide <b>residues</b> in the remaining soil samples are evaluated by tunnelling bioassays using the field collected subterranean termites, Coptotermes acinaciformis (Froggatt). Both tunnelling distance and mortality are used as indicators of termiticide activity and availability. This paper compares the traditional soil test methods with our new approach, which addresses the problems of security with longevity of test, variability of termite hazard levels at different field sites, and a practical method for managing variables in assessing potential soil termiticides. Importantly, this technique prevents the direct destruction of natural populations of subterranean termites or the indirect contamination by contact from soil <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> termiticides applied in and around active termite colonies...|$|R
40|$|Besides intact plants {{different}} in vitro-systems {{have been used}} for an ecotoxicological evaluation of chemicals. All plant test systems were able to metabolize the compounds by common metabolic pathways. The results obtained are: all compounds, even non-polar ones, are assimilated by the different plant systems. Uptake depended on the plant species and on the physico-chemical properties of the chemicals. The main metabolites were polar conjugates with plant constituents (carbohydrates, amino acids, glutathione etc.). PAHs were partly converted to oxygenated derivatives which are known to be even more toxic. Depending on the plant species large amounts of the chemicals, and/or their metabolites, were frequently incorporated into bound residues.

40|$|Soils at {{agrochemical}} dealer sites {{often are}} contaminated with pesticide <b>residues</b> from decades <b>of</b> accidental and incidental spillage. We {{have determined that}} prairie grasses native to the Midwestern U. S. are suitable for phytoremediation because they are tolerant of most herbicides and of climatic extremes, such as heat, cold, drought, and flooding. A mixed stand of big bluestem, switch grass, and yellow indiangrass develops a rhizosphere with microflora that can readily detoxify pesticide residues. Specific atrazine-degrading bacteria or the free enzyme atrazine chlorohydrolase also can enhance the rate of biotransformation of atrazine in soil. Metolachlor degradation can be accelerated significantly by the prairie grass/rhizosphere effect. Several grasses used in filter strips have also been evaluated for their pesticidedegradation capabilities. The prairie grasses also have been demonstrated to reduce the rates of leaching of pesticides through intact soil columns, since less water leaches out of vegetated soil columns compared to non-vegetated soil columns. The evaluation {{of the degree of}} success of remediation has relied heavily on chemical residue analysis, but recent studies on biological endpoints have shown promise for providing more ecologically relevant indications of the potential exposure of organisms to pesticides in the soil. Earthworm 8 -day bioaccumulation assays and root growth assays have shown the value <b>of</b> assessing the <b>bioavailability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>residues.</b> Mass balance experiments have utilized radiolabeled atrazine and metolachlor to ascertain the complete metabolism and binding profile of those two pesticides in phytoremediation studies...|$|R
40|$|Crop {{residues}} remaining after {{grain harvest}} {{are an important}} potential source of nutrients, including phosphorus (P), to the cropping system. Crop residues contain both inorganic and organic forms of P and these forms may take different pathways into soil P pools. The rate and quantity <b>of</b> <b>residue</b> P released depends partly on the specific P compounds in the residues. The most commonly used measure of P in crop residues is total P, followed by separate measurement of inorganic P and organic P. These measures do not speciate residue P into specific compounds and consequently, residue P dynamics in soils remains poorly understood. This thesis characterises P contained in crop residues using solution ³¹P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and compares this technique with conventional chemical fractionation methods. These initial analytical studies {{provided the basis for}} subsequent investigations of the effect of plant P status and residue management on release <b>of</b> <b>residue</b> P in a soil-plant system, leading to a better understanding <b>of</b> the potential <b>bioavailability</b> <b>of</b> <b>residue</b> P in soil. Inorganic and organic P forms were quantified using ³¹P NMR spectroscopy in different plant components (stem, chaff and seed) collected from field grown cereal and legume crops. The main forms of P detected in stem and chaff were orthophosphate (35 - 75 %) and the easily degradable organic P forms, phospholipids (10 - 40 %) and RNA (5 - 30 %). The majority (65 - 90 %) of P in stems was water-extractable, and most of this was detected as orthophosphate. This indicated that the majority <b>of</b> <b>residue</b> P in aboveground plant residues {{has the potential to be}} delivered to soil in a form readily available to plants and soil microorganisms. An integrated approach combining spectroscopic techniques with chemical extraction assisted with verifying assumptions made when using chemical fractionation methods. The main assumptions investigated were; the selectivity of chemical extractants for a single P species, the ability of the extractant to bring all of the P form into solution, and to examine if other P species were released into solution or if the P speciation was changed with extraction. The results showed that the orthophosphate concentration in water/acid extracts was increased due to the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate and organic P species, but decreased due to incomplete recovery of orthophosphate from the crop residues. These effects largely cancelled each other out. Treatments widely used to extract phospholipid (extraction with ethanol:ether and ethanol:ether:chloroform), were found to be selective for phospholipid P, but were quite ineffective, with only ~ 10 % of the phospholipid P determined by solution ³¹P NMR extracted in each case. These results strongly suggest that speciation <b>of</b> crop <b>residue</b> P using chemical fractionation can be compromised by the incomplete recovery of a given P species and the transformation of other P species during extraction. As plants approach maturity and start to senesce, the primary sink for phosphorus is the seed but it is unclear how plant P status affects the resulting P concentration and speciation in the seed and remaining plant parts, i. e. the residues. Wheat and canola grown in the glasshouse were supplied three different P rates (5, 30 and 60 kg P ha⁻¹ equivalent) designed to represent deficient, adequate and luxury levels of P. The speciation of P in roots, stem, leaves, chaff/pod and grain was examined. Stems and leaves, which contribute the bulk <b>of</b> post-harvest <b>residue</b> P, were dominated by orthophosphate, regardless of plant P status. Minor differences were observed in P speciation across the three P application rates and plant parts. The effect of this on P cycling is likely to be relatively minor in comparison to the overall contribution <b>of</b> these <b>residues</b> to soil P pools. Release of nutrients, including P from crop residues remaining post-harvest is an important potential source of nutrients for subsequent crops. The effect <b>of</b> <b>residue</b> size and placement <b>of</b> field-collected pea <b>residue</b> on subsequent P uptake by wheat, soil hexanol-released P and resin-extractable P was measured in a glasshouse experiment. On average, > 50 % <b>of</b> <b>residue</b> P was detected in plant, microbial and resin P pools when incorporated in soil compared to 20 % for the two surface-placed residue treatments. When considering how residue management strategies may influence P supply to crops, incorporating residues will increase the rate of release and decomposition and therefore the potential for plant roots (if present) to access this P. The results also indicate that even though residue P takes longer to break down under no-till management, this system will still provide small but agronomically significant amounts of P to subsequent crops.

A simple and versatile method was used to reach the surface functionalization of poly(d,l-lactic acid) (PLA) nanoparticles by mannose moieties: It consists in using an amphiphilic mannosylated poly(ethylene oxide) -b-poly(-caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCL) diblock copolymer as a bioresorbable surface modifier in a simple nanoprecipitation-evaporation procedure. The size and zeta potential of the nanoparticles were found {{to depend on the}} molar copolymer/PLA ratio, demonstrating the influence of the copolymer on the formation of the nanoparticles. The <b>bioavailability</b> <b>of</b> the mannose <b>residues</b> as specific recognition sites on the nanoparticle surface could be demonstrated by a modified enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) using biotin-labeled lectins which interact specifically with α-d-mannopyrannoside derivatives. Besides specific interaction by lectin−mannose complex formation, nonspecific adsorption of the proteins on the nanoparticle surface was observed. These results were fully supported by isothermal titration calorimetry experiments which suggested that the balance between specific and nonspecific interactions can be controlled by the amount of glycosylated polymer used for the preparation of the nanoparticles. Such nanoparticles are expected to be specifically recognized by mannose receptors, which are highly expressed in cells of the immune system.

40|$|Risk-based {{approaches}} to managing contaminated land, rather than approaches based on complete contaminant removal, have gained acceptance {{as they are}} likely to be more feasible and cost effective. Risk-based approaches aim to minimise risks of exposure of a specified contaminant to humans. However, adopting a risk-based approach over alternative overly-conservative approaches requires that associated uncertainties in decision making are understood and minimised. Irrespective of the nature of contaminants, a critical uncertainty is whether there are potential risks associated with exposure to the residual contaminant fractions in soil to humans and other ecological receptors, and how they should be considered in the risk assessment process. This review focusing on hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs), especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), suggests that there is significant uncertainty on the residual fractions of contaminants from risk perspectives. This is because very few studies have focused on understanding the desorption behaviour of HOCs, with few or no studies considering the influence of exposure-specific factors. In particular, it is not clear whether the exposure of soil-associated HOCs to gastrointestinal fluids and enzyme processes release bound residues. Although, in vitro models have been used to predict PAH bioaccessibility, and chemical extractions have been used to determine residual fractions in various soils, there are still doubts about what is actually being measured. Therefore it is not certain which bioaccessibility method currently represents the best choice, or provides the best estimate, of in vivo PAH bioavailability. It is suggested that the fate and behaviour of HOCs in a wide range of soils, and that consider exposure-specific scenarios, be investigated. Exposure-specific scenarios are important for validation purposes, which may be useful for the development of standardised methods and procedures for HOC bioaccessibility determinations. Research is needed to propose the most appropriate testing methods and for assessing potential risks posed by residual fractions of HOCs. Such investigations may be useful for minimising uncertainties associated with a risk-based approach, so that consideration may then be given to its adoption on a global scale. This review critically appraises existing information on the <b>bioavailability</b> <b>of</b> HOC <b>residues</b> in soil to establish whether there may be risks from highly sequestered contaminant residues...|$|R

Therefore, {{research in this}} project was designed to provide {{an understanding of the}} influence of various environmental factors on the kinetics and <b>bioavailability</b> <b>of</b> solvent-laden soils...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} that the ingestion of omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n- 3 LC-PUFA) can improve health. However, little scientific attention has been paid on the actual <b>bioavailability</b> <b>of</b> n- 3 LC-PUFA. In this thesis, several nutritional questions related to <b>bioavailability</b> <b>of</b> n- 3 LC-PUFA have been answered...|$|R
