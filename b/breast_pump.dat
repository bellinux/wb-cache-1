25|$|A <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> is a {{mechanical}} device that extracts milk from the breasts of a lactating woman. Breast pumps may be manual devices powered by hand or foot movements or electrical devices powered by mains electricity or batteries. The first <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> was patented by O.H. Needham on June 20, 1854.|$|E
25|$|The plastic tubing and horn of an {{electric}} <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> are {{commonly referred to as}} the collection system. When this style of <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> was originally developed, the pump's suction was supplied through the collection system tubing. This type of collection system design is now referred to as an open system.|$|E
25|$|Mechanically, a <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> is {{analogous}} to a milking machine used in commercial dairy production. A misconception is that the <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> suctions milk out of the breast. A breast pump's job is to trigger the milk ejection response or letdown. Pumps achieve this by using suction to pull the nipple into the tunnel of the breast shield or flange, then release, which counts as one cycle. Thirty to sixty cycles per minute can be expected with better-quality electric breast pumps. The <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> is not as efficient at removing milk from the breast as most nursing babies. Most manufacturers have multiple sizes of nipple tunnels available. These tunnels {{range in size from}} 24mm to 36mm.|$|E
25|$|Foot-powered <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> use {{the same}} {{collection}} tubing and breast horns as electric <b>breast</b> <b>pumps,</b> but are powered by a foot pedal. This eliminates the work of pumping by hand or the need for finding an electrical outlet with privacy.|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{descriptive study}} examined the beliefs and experiences of 12 lactation consultants regarding the impact of <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> on breastfeeding practices. Interview topics on <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> included types and patterns of use, mothers' experiences, and advantages and risks. The lactation consultants reported {{an increase in the}} use of <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> due to improved marketing, a change in society's view of pumps as a necessity rather than a luxury, and the impact of birthing technology. Reasons given for this increased use were mothers' need to have greater control over the breastfeeding process and to quantify the amount of breastmilk. Concerns were expressed regarding an overdependency on breastfeeding technology by some lactation consultants and mothers...|$|R
2500|$|There are {{two types}} of {{electric}} <b>breast</b> <b>pumps,</b> hospital grade and personal use pumps. Hospital grade pumps are larger and intended for multiple users. Personal use pumps are smaller and generally intended for one user. Electric <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> are powered by a motor which supplies suction through plastic tubing to a horn that fits over the nipple. [...] The portions of the pump that come into direct contact with the expressed milk must be sterilized to prevent contamination. [...] This style provides a lot more suction, making pumping significantly faster, and allows <b>pumping</b> of both <b>breasts</b> at the same time. [...] Electric <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> are ideal for when a mother will be pumping daily. [...] Electric <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> are larger than manual ones, but portable models are available (e.g. in a backpack or shoulder bag) that allow the mother to transport the pump. Some manufacturers have battery packs or built in batteries to allow portable operation of the pumps. Some electric pumps allow for multiuser operation, requiring only an accessory kit for each user.|$|R

25|$|The {{invention}} of formula was hypothesized {{as a way}} for western culture to adapt to negative perceptions of breastfeeding. The <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> offered a way for mothers to supply breast milk with most of formula feeding's convenience and without enduring possible disapproval of nursing.|$|E
25|$|A {{mother can}} express (produce) her milk for storage and later use. Expression occurs with massage or a <b>breast</b> <b>pump.</b> It {{can be stored}} in freezer storage bags, {{containers}} made specifically for breastmilk, a supplemental nursing system, or a bottle ready for use. Using someone other than the mother/wet nurse to deliver the bottle maintains the baby's association of nursing with the mother/wet nurse and bottle feeding with other people.|$|E
2500|$|Some <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{designed}} {{to be part of a}} [...] "feeding system" [...] so that the milk storage portion of the pump is the baby bottle used to feed the infant. This allows the milk to be collected in the same bottle that will feed the baby eliminating the need to transfer breastmilk. [...] Freezable breastmilk storage bags are available that connect directly to some <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> and can then be used with disposable bottle feeding systems.|$|R

40|$|The {{necessity}} of maintenance of breast feeding {{of a child}} in the first months of his life causes the need for development of preventive measures and plugged duct treatment. Results of use of electric <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> by mothers under impossibility of breast feeding by a physiological way are presented. It is shown that modern <b>breast</b> <b>pumps,</b> optimally imitating a peristaltic sucking of a child, allow to reduce time for expression, and also to make it painless and comfortable. It supports mothers' desire of long breast feeding, providing, thus, formation of a child health. <br /...|$|R
2500|$|On June 20, 1854, the United States Patent Office issued Patent No. 11,135 to O.H. Needham for a <b>breast</b> <b>pump.</b> Scientific American (1863) credits L.O. Colbin as the {{inventor}} and patent applicant of a <b>breast</b> <b>pump.</b> In 1921-23, engineer and chess master Edward Lasker produced a mechanical <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> that imitated an infant's sucking action and was regarded by physicians as a marked improvement on existing hand-operated breast pumps, which failed {{to remove all}} the milk from the breast. The U.S. Patent Office issued [...] for Lasker's <b>breast</b> <b>pump.</b> In 1956 Einar Egnell published his groundbreaking work, [...] "Viewpoints on what happens mechanically in the female breast during various methods of milk collection". This article provided insight to {{the technical aspects of}} milk extraction from the breast. The Egnell SMB breastpump designed through this research is quite robust and many pumps are still in operation today over 50 years after publication.|$|E
2500|$|Women use breast pumps {{for many}} reasons. Many women use breast pumps to {{continue}} breastfeeding after {{they return to}} work. They use the pump to express breast milk, which is later bottle fed to their child by a caregiver. A <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> may {{also be used to}} stimulate lactation for women with a low milk supply or those who have not just given birth. However, {{it is important to note}} that the amount of milk a woman is able to pump should not be compared to how much milk a baby can get; efficiency greatly varies. A <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> may be used to relieve engorgement, a painful condition whereby the breasts are overfull, possibly preventing a proper latch by the infant. A mother may also choose to pump exclusively if her baby does not latch properly, is hospitalized after birth, or cannot nurse for physical reasons (such as cleft palate). If the mother needs to take medication that affects the breast milk and may be harmful to the infant, which is a very rare instance, the mother may [...] "pump and dump" [...] the breast milk to keep up her milk supply during the time period that she is on the medication and may resume nursing after the course of medication is completed. Pumping may be desirable to continue lactation and its associated hormones to aid in recovery from pregnancy even if the pumped milk is not used.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 a {{domestic}} staff agency in China named Xinxinyu {{was reported to}} be providing wet nurses for the sick and other adults as well as for newborns. The agency's clients could choose to drink the breast milk directly from the breast or to drink it via a <b>breast</b> <b>pump.</b> The reports caused controversy in China, with one writer describing it as [...] "adding to China's problem of treating women as consumer goods and the moral degradation of China's rich." [...] The agency was forced to suspend its operations by Chinese authorities for a number of reasons, one of which was for missing three years of annual checks.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> allow direct {{collection}} of <b>pumped</b> <b>breast</b> milk into a container {{that can be}} used for storage and feeding. Many pumps are proprietary, and you must use the manufacturer's bottles for this purpose. Other manufacturers allow for adapters to fit a variety of types and sizes of bottles, which allows more selection and the ability to change collection and feeding system based on mothers' and babies' preferences.|$|R
25|$|Both {{mother and}} baby {{must be treated}} {{to get rid of}} this infection. First-line therapies include nystatin, ketaconazole or {{miconazole}} applied to the nipple and given by mouth to the baby. Strict cleaning of clothing and <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> is also required to eradicate the infection.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, the Yayasan DiRaja Sultan Mizan, a local {{foundation}} of the Royal Family of Terengganu, represented by Her Majesty distributed milk bottle especially for cleft-lipped babies, <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> for mothers and related devices to help people with eyesight problems through Hospital Nur Zahirah.|$|R
2500|$|A {{report in}} 2009 on {{research}} done at Stanford University showed {{the correlation of}} various factors with mature milk production in mothers of preterm babies (born before the 31st week of gestation). The research found that using massage techniques {{in addition to a}} <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> (a technique they call [...] "hands on pumping", or HOP), along with several other factors, was highly correlated with higher milk production. The study found that the mothers who used massage techniques and hand expression more than 5 times a day in the first 3 days after birth could increase their milk production 8 weeks later, and that, by combining this with HOP, milk production increased 48% even without increased pumping. The authors of the report produced a video which shows the technique and states that this technique is good for both mothers of premature infants as well as mothers that return to work or pump for other purposes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{diaphragm}} in {{a closed}} system eliminates the possibility of milk being able to overflow into the pump tubing. Because milk is not exposed to the pump motor, closed collection systems are marketed as [...] more hygienic than open collection systems. It is important to clean the diaphragm as condensation or milk may reach this part causing bacterial contamination. If the diaphragm is contaminated this may defeat {{the purpose of the}} closed system. The barrier {{in a closed}} collection system <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> is marketed as preventing outside air from contaminating the expressed breastmilk in the collection bottle, which preserves the milk’s purity. The diaphragm may limit the amount of air/suction {{that can be used to}} extract milk from the breast. It may also not be able to compensate for larger shield sizes as well. There are no studies comparing the open versus closed system design. Most information is marketing materials without studies to back them up.|$|E

2500|$|When infants {{are unable}} to suckle, mothers can pump if they wish their babies to be fed with the mothers' own milk. Donor milk may be {{available}} from milk banks for babies who {{are not able to}} receive their mothers' milk. Expressing milk for donation is another use for <b>breast</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|R
40|$|The study {{about the}} effects of {{biotechnology}} on women's body within reproductive practices, has intrigued researchers from all disciplines. This research aims at investigating the motivations of women to donate their milk to a human milk bank and the relationship between the use of technology, such a <b>breast</b> <b>pumps,</b> with processes of embodiment. The scarcity of studies about the experiences of women to donate their milk to a milk bank has lead me to investigate the historical process through which milk banks have supplanted wet nursing activities and how nowadays, women use the service of milk banks. This research embraces the feminist approach by analysing women's narratives through the perspective of Grosz's theory on embodiment and subjectivity. The methodology applied to investigate women's subjectivity consist of 10 interviews to women milk donors about their experiences in using <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> and regarding the motivations to donate the milk to the milk bank. The analyses of women's narratives highlight that (1) women with milk surplus decide to donate their milk because they attribute a specific value to the milk. The value of the milk takes into consideration women's effort to have a healthy and balanced life. To describe themselves and their body (2) while using <b>breast</b> <b>pumps,</b> women recur to metaphors such as 'I feel like a machine' which embodied dominant ideas on the reproductive body. This study wants to contribute to theories on embodiment within maternal reproductive practices and infants feeding practices...|$|R
2500|$|Breastfeeding {{promotion}} is {{a movement}} that came about {{in the twentieth century}} in response to high rates of bottle-feeding among mothers, and in recognition of the many health benefits to both mothers and children that breastfeeding offers. While infant formula had been introduced in developed countries in the 1920s as a healthy way to feed one's children, the emergence of research on health benefits of breastfeeding precipitated the beginning of the breastfeeding promotion movement in the United States. [...] In the 1950s, La Leche League meetings began. The United States began incorporating benefits specific to breastfeeding promotion into its Women, Infants, and Children program in 1972. In 1989, WIC state agencies began being required to spend funds targeted at breastfeeding support and promotion, including the provision of education materials in different languages and the purchase of <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> and other supplies. In 1998, WIC state agencies were authorized to use funds earmarked for food to purchase <b>breast</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Lactation insufficiency: [...] The {{mother is}} unable to produce {{sufficient}} milk. In studies that do not account for lactation failure with obvious causes (such as use of formula and/or <b>breast</b> <b>pumps),</b> this affects around 2 to 5% of women.

50|$|American studies {{indicate}} that cracked nipples are caused by the incorrect latching-on by the infant. Yet other causes could be poor positioning, use of a feeding bottle, breast engorgement, inexperience, semi-protruding nipples, use of <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> and light pigmentation of the nipples. These causes vary between cultures. Breast engorgement is also a main factor in altering {{the ability of the}} infant to latch-on. Engorgement changes the shape and curvature of the nipple region by making the breast inflexible, flat, hard, and swollen. The nipples on an engorged breast are flat.|$|R

They also allow for only one <b>breast</b> to be <b>pumped</b> at a time. This style is recommended for infrequent usage such as when a woman is away from her baby for a single feeding. These pumps may not provide sufficient stimulation and emptying of the breast. It is recommended that [...] "bicycle horn" [...] style manual pumps not be used. [...] Though cheap, they can damage breast tissue and harbor bacteria in the rubber suction bulb, which is difficult to clean.|$|R
