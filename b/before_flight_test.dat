40|$|Wind tunnel based Virtual Flight Testing (VFT) is {{a dynamic}} wind tunnel test for {{evaluating}} flight control systems (FCS) proposed in recent decades.

In this paper, the background, progress, and prospects of VFT are systematically summarized. Specifically, the differences among VFT, traditional dynamic wind tunnel methods, and traditional FCS evaluation methods are introduced in order to address the advantages of evaluating FCS with VFT.

40|$|This {{research}} work provides {{the development of}} an Adaptive Flight Control System (AFCS) for autonomous hover of a Rotary-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (RUAV). Due to the complex, nonlinear and time-varying dynamics of the RUAV, indirect adaptive control using the Model Predictive Control (MPC) is utilised. The performance of the MPC mainly depends on the model of the RUAV used for predicting the future behaviour. Due to the complexities associated with the RUAV dynamics, a neural network based black box identification technique is used for modelling the behaviour of the RUAV. Auto-regressive neural network architecture is developed for offline and online modelling purposes. A hybrid modelling technique that exploits the advantages of both the offline and the online models is proposed. In the hybrid modelling technique, the predictions from the offline trained model are corrected by using the error predictions from the online model at every sample time. To reduce the computational time for training the neural networks, a principal component analysis based algorithm that reduces the dimension of the input training data is also proposed. This approach is shown to reduce the computational time significantly. These identification techniques are validated in numerical simulations <b>before</b> <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> in the Eagle and RMAX helicopter platforms. Using the successfully validated models of the RUAVs, Neural Network based Model Predictive Controller (NN-MPC) is developed taking into account the non-linearity of the RUAVs and constraints into consideration. The parameters of the MPC are chosen to satisfy the performance requirements imposed on the flight controller. The optimisation problem is solved numerically using nonlinear optimisation techniques. The performance of the controller is extensively validated using numerical simulation models <b>before</b> <b>flight</b> <b>testing.</b> The effects of actuator and sensor delays and noises along with the wind gusts are taken into account during these numerical simulations. In addition, the robustness of the controller is validated numerically for possible parameter variations. The numerical simulation results are compared with a base-line PID controller. Finally, the NN-MPCs are <b>flight</b> <b>tested</b> for height control and autonomous hover. For these, SISO as well as multiple SISO controllers are used. The <b>flight</b> <b>tests</b> are conducted in varying weather conditions to validate the utility of the control technique. The NN-MPC in conjunction with the proposed hybrid modelling technique is shown to handle additional disturbances successfully. Extensive <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> results provide justification {{for the use of the}} NN-MPC technique as a reliable technique for control of non-linear complex dynamic systems such as RUAVs...|$|R

40|$|A {{morphing}} {{concept of}} a telescopic wing with airfoil shape change capability was designed and analyzed using coupled fluid-structure interaction. Morphing strategies for drag reduction are proposed. Morphing benefits were estimated in terms of extra loading at take-off speed and drag reduction with speed.

A preliminary experimental telescopic wing based on this concept and geometry without airfoil shape change capability was built and ground tested in terms of actuation energy and structural loads. Actuation energy and actuation time results are promising for morphing in level flight.

40|$|In this paper, scale-adaptive {{simulation}} is used {{to study}} store trajectory variability for releases from transonic weapon bays. The scale-adaptive simulation captures the essential physics of the flow in the weapon bay, and its speed of computation allows for several trajectories to be computed within reasonable time. The results of the simulations are treated as a statistical set and a metric is put forward to decide the minimum number of simulations necessary to establish the mean and the standard deviation of the releases. Averaging the results of all trajectories was useful in developing an overall understanding of the bay pressure field role on the store trajectories. Filtering the obtained trajectories provided insight in the flow frequencies affecting the forces acting on the store and the coordinates of its center of gravity during releases. For the store employed in this study, less than one month of CPU time is needed for the complete set of simulations to be obtained, making this method promising as a further <b>test</b> <b>before</b> <b>flight</b> <b>testing...</b>|$|R

40|$|Approach {{and landing}} {{are among the}} most {{difficult}} flight regimes for automatic control of fixed-wing aircraft. Additional challenges are introduced when working with unmanned aerial vehicles, such as modelling uncertainty and limited gust tolerance. This thesis develops linear discrete-time automatic landing controllers using Quantitative Feedback Theory to ensure control robustness and adequate disturbance rejection. Controllers are developed in simulation and evaluated in <b>flight</b> <b>tests</b> of the low cost Easy Star remote-controlled platform. System identification of the larger Pegasus unmanned aerial vehicle is performed to identify dynamic models from flight data. A full set of controllers are subsequently developed and evaluated in simulation for the Pegasus. The extensive simulation and experimental testing with the Easy Star will reduce the time required to implement the Pegasus control laws, and will reduce the associated risk by validating the core experimental software. It is concluded that the control synthesis process using Quantitative Feedback Theory provides robust controllers with generally adequate performance, based on simulation and hardware results. The Quantitative Feedback Theory framework provides a good method for synthesizing the inner-loop controllers and satisfying performance requirements, but in many of the cases considered here it is found to be impractical for the outer loop designs. The primary recommendations of this work are: perform additional verification flights on the Easy Star; repeat Pegasus system identification for a landing configuration <b>before</b> <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> the control laws; design and implement a rudder control loop on the Pegasus for control of the vehicle after touchdown...|$|R
5000|$|On 3 March 2016, DARPA awarded Aurora Flight Sciences $89.4 {{million to}} build and {{demonstrate}} their LightningStrike concept, beating out the other three competitors. The LightningStrike is a tilting-wing design powered by one Rolls-Royce AE1107C turboshaft engine, the same type used on the V-22 Osprey, that generates electric power via three Honeywell generators to run 24 distributed ducted fans, three each in the forward canards and 18 across the main wing. Rather than using conventional engines {{like all the other}} entrants, the aircraft relies on [...] "distributed electric propulsion," [...] where the three generators that produce three megawatts (4,023 horsepower) of electricity, as much as a commercial wind turbine, power individual motors that drive the fans; each wing fan uses a 100 kW motor, and each canard fan a 70 kW motor.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} in designing low level control loops for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) is that the manufacturing process for airframes is not consistent enough to ensure uniform aerodynamic properties.

They were intended {{to be used in}} the parade, but bad weather forced the cancellation of their flypast. Two of them were assigned to participate in the state acceptance trials while others were used as testbeds for various programs. The trials were concluded in June and the MiG-9 generally met the performance goals set by the Council of People's Commissars. The test pilots found the fighter easy and simple to fly. Defects noted during testing were that the engines flamed out when firing the cannon at high altitudes due to gun gas ingestion, no ejection seat was fitted, nor were air brakes or a fire suppression system. The fuel tanks were not self-sealing and no armor was provided for the pilot. Despite these drawbacks, the MiG-9 was ordered into production at Factory No. 1 before the acceptance tests were completed as the Soviet leadership believed that its shortcomings could be rectified during production. A batch of 50 aircraft, 40 single-seat fighters and 10 two-seat trainers, were ordered in late 1946 to participate in the 1947 May Day parade.

40|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>tests</b> of Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation s Quiet Spike(TradeMark) {{hardware}} {{were recently}} completed on the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center F- 15 B airplane. NASA Dryden uses a modified F- 15 B airplane as a testbed aircraft to cost-effectively fly flight research experiments that are typically mounted underneath the F- 15 B airplane, along the fuselage centerline. For the Quiet Spike(TradeMark) experiment, however, {{instead of a}} centerline mounting, a relatively long forward-pointing boom {{was attached to the}} radar bulkhead of the F- 15 B airplane. The Quiet Spike(TradeMark) experiment is a stepping-stone to airframe structural morphing technologies designed to mitigate the sonic-boom strength of business jets over land. The Quiet Spike(TradeMark) boom is a concept in which an aircraft s noseboom would be extended prior to supersonic acceleration. This morphing effectively lengthens the aircraft, thus reducing the peak sonic-boom amplitude, but is also expected to partition the otherwise strong bow shock into a series of reduced-strength, noncoalescing shocklets. Prior to flying the Quiet Spike(TradeMark) experiment on the F- 15 B airplane several ground vibration tests were required to understand the Quiet Spike(TradeMark) modal characteristics and coupling effects with the F- 15 B airplane. However, due to the flight hardware availability and compressed schedule requirements, a "traditional" ground vibration test of the mated F- 15 B Quiet Spike(TradeMark) ready-for- flight configuration did not leave sufficient time available for the finite element model update and flutter analyses <b>before</b> <b>flight</b> <b>testing.</b> Therefore, a "nontraditional" ground vibration testing approach was taken.
