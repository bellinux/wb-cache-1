5|$|Handley was {{replaced}} by Dan Reeves, the successful former {{head coach of the}} Denver Broncos who led the Broncos to three Super Bowls in four years, one against the Giants. After his dismissal from the Broncos, Reeves took the unusual step of lobbying heavily for the job. Especially after being publicly rebuffed by a number of candidates, George Young was pleased that someone with Reeves's credentials wanted the job, and Reeves was hired as Giants head coach. He had been a finalist along with Perkins for the team's head coaching position in 1979, <b>but</b> <b>Young</b> went with Perkins at the time because he felt he knew him better from their days together with the Baltimore Colts.|$|E

5|$|In June 1847, Brannan {{traveled}} overland to Green River, Wyoming, to {{meet with}} Brigham Young, {{the head of the}} Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who was leading the first contingent of Mormon pioneers across the plains to the Great Basin region. Brannan urged Young to bring the Mormon pioneers to California as was previously planned, <b>but</b> <b>Young</b> rejected the proposal in favor of settling in what is present-day Utah. Brannan returned to northern California frustrated with how the meeting had gone. Being the only church leader of that region, Brannan continued to receive tithes of the church members, but no records have been found showing that those tithes were forwarded to the leaders of the church in Utah. Many members stopped paying him and began making their way eastward toward Salt Lake valley known to the Mormons as Zion.|$|E
5|$|Terns are seabirds in {{the family}} Laridae that have a {{worldwide}} distribution and are normally found near the sea, rivers, or wetlands. Terns are treated as a subgroup of the family Laridae which includes gulls and skimmers and consist of eleven genera. They are slender, lightly built birds with long, forked tails, narrow wings, long bills, and relatively short legs. Most species are pale grey above and white below, with a contrasting black cap to the head, but the marsh terns, the Inca tern, and some noddies have dark plumage for {{at least part of}} the year. The sexes are identical in appearance, <b>but</b> <b>young</b> birds are readily distinguishable from adults. Terns have a non-breeding plumage, which usually involves a white forehead and much-reduced black cap.|$|E
5|$|Transandinomys talamancae is a medium-sized, {{brightly colored}} rice rat. It {{is similar to}} T.bolivaris and the two are often confused. They are about as large, but in T.talamancae the tail is longer and the hindfeet shorter. Both species share uniquely long vibrissae, with both the mystacial (above the mouth) and superciliary vibrissae {{extending}} to or beyond the back margin of the ears when laid back against the head, but those in T.bolivaris are substantially longer. H.alfaroi, a widespread species ranging from Mexico to Ecuador, is also similar. It is smaller and darker, <b>but</b> <b>young</b> adult T.talamancae are similar in color to adult H.alfaroi and often misidentified. Hylaeamys megacephalus, with which T.talamancae was synonymized for some decades, is similar in body size, but is not known to overlap with T.talamancae in range.|$|E

25|$|The adult takahē {{is mainly}} purple-blue in colour, with a greenish back and inner wings. It has a red frontal shield and red-based pink bill. The legs are pink.

25|$|Over {{the next}} few years, Young and his group {{continued}} traveling to Alta California to trap and trade. In 1834 in San Diego, Young encountered Hall J. Kelley, the great promoter of the Oregon Country from Boston. Kelley invited Ewing Young to accompany him north to Oregon, <b>but</b> <b>Young</b> at first declined. After re-thinking, Young agreed to travel with Kelley and they set out in July 1834, with a group including Webley John Hauxhurst and Joseph Gale, both prominent figures in the Willamette Valley, accompanying them.|$|E
25|$|Allowing {{plants to}} grow in its place, e.g., the {{establishment}} of woodland, causes shade that inhibits bracken growth. In the UK, trees, notably rowan, have done well since grazing reduced greatly after the foot-and-mouth epidemic in 2000 <b>but</b> <b>young</b> saplings struggle in high bracken. In decades to come, tree shade cover may increase, if permitted, and so may reduce bracken growth, but this is both long-term {{and in some cases}} is contentious in the change it would bring to traditionally open heath or moorland, both aesthetically and as a valuable habitat.|$|E
25|$|The Pirates started Game1 strong, scoring six runs in {{the first}} four innings.

Boston tried to mount a comeback in the last three innings, but it was too little too late, and they ended up losing by a score of 7–3 in the first ever World Series game. Both Phillippe and Young threw complete games, with Phillippe striking out ten and Young fanning five, <b>but</b> <b>Young</b> also gave up twice as many hits and allowed three earned runs to Phillippe's two.|$|E

The marchers, including John Lewis of SNCC, Hosea Williams of SCLC, and Selma activist Amelia Boynton, cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge and approach a line of state troopers who put on gas masks. The troopers order the marchers to turn back, and when they hold their ground the troopers attack with clubs, horses, tear gas, and other weapons. Lewis and Boynton are among those badly injured. The attack is shown on national television as the wounded are treated at Brown Chapel, the movement's headquarter church.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, Ernst (2008) advocates that {{efficient}} integration initially relies upon establishing correspondence – which sensory signals belong together. Indeed, {{studies have}} shown that visuo-haptic integration fails in adults when there is a perceived spatial separation, suggesting sensory information is coming from different targets. Furthermore, if the separation can be explained, for example viewing an object through a mirror, integration is re-established and can even be optimal. Ernst (2008) suggests that adults can obtain this knowledge from previous experiences to quickly determine which sensory sources depict the same target, <b>but</b> <b>young</b> children could be deficient in this area. Once there is a sufficient bank of experiences, confidence to correctly integrate sensory signals can then be introduced in their behaviour.|$|E
25|$|The vanguard {{company now}} faced a more rugged and {{hazardous}} journey, and {{were concerned about}} negotiating the passes of the Rocky Mountains. They had received conflicting advice, <b>but</b> <b>Young</b> chose to follow the trail used by the Donner-Reed party on their journey to California the previous year. Shortly after leaving Fort Bridger, the group met trapper Miles Goodyear, who owned a trading post {{at the mouth of}} the Weber River. He was enthusiastic about the agricultural potential of the large Weber Valley. During the trip through the rugged mountains, the vanguard company divided into three sections. Since crossing the Green River, several members of the party had suffered from a fever, generally accepted as a “mountain fever” probably induced by wood ticks. Young himself became ill soon after meeting Goodyear. The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group, and a scouting division was created to move ahead on the designated route.|$|E
