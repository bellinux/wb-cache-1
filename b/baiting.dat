40|$|Three {{types of}} {{long-life}} stoat <b>bait</b> (polymer, paste, and gel) were formulated from natural and synthetic <b>bait</b> ingredients after extensive testing of potential ingredients. Feeding trials demonstrated that <b>baits</b> containing natural extracts from rabbit and chicken were preferred to <b>bait</b> that contained only processed meals and synthetic flavours. The addition of preservatives and waterproofing agents to improve <b>bait</b> longevity, lowered palatability markedly in all <b>bait</b> types. The texture of <b>bait</b> also affected {{the amount of}} <b>bait</b> eaten, with most stoats rejecting <b>baits</b> that were hard or needed to be chewed before they could be swallowed. In this study, significantly more long-life polymer and paste <b>bait</b> was eaten than gel <b>bait.</b> The polymer <b>bait</b> remained palatable after one month in the field. Although all long-life <b>bait</b> formulations tested were less palatable than fresh meat, most stoats (i. e. ≥ 90 %) consumed sufficient quantities of polymer and paste <b>baits</b> to receive a lethal dose (> 5 g) if <b>baits</b> had contained a toxin.

40|$|One of {{the most}} popular methods for {{achieving}} control of the Red Imported Fire Ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren, is through the use of broadcast <b>baits.</b> Several factors contribute to <b>bait</b> efficacy, one of which may be particle size. The goals of these laboratory studies were to determine particle size and <b>bait</b> preference using Advance Select Granular Ant <b>Bait</b> and Advance Carpenter Ant Scatter <b>Bait,</b> determine the effect of starvation on <b>bait</b> removal and recruitment to Carpenter Ant Scatter <b>Bait,</b> and determine if any correlation existed between head capsule width and particle size selected. Experimental colonies removed significantly more 1400 - 2000 ?m particles of Select Granular Ant <b>Bait,</b> while ants foraging on Carpenter Ant Scatter <b>Bait</b> preferred 1000 - 1400 ?m particles. Mean number of ants present at <b>bait</b> mirrored results from <b>bait</b> removal test. Ants displayed a preference for Carpenter Ant Scatter <b>Bait</b> based on mean number of ants present at <b>bait</b> for the 10 -d foraging period. For starvation assays, significant differences in <b>bait</b> removal and number of ants present occurred in the 0 -d group. Ants starved for 5 d removed significantly more <b>bait</b> of all particle sizes, and removed greater amounts of 1000 - 1400 ?m Carpenter Ant Scatter <b>Bait</b> than other sizes.

Raccoons thrive in human-dominated landscapes, and the fecal-oral transmission pathway and lack of effective treatment make B. procyonis a serious threat to public health. The distribution of medicinal <b>baits</b> has emerged as a socially acceptable and cost-effective method for managing disease in free-ranging wildlife. We assessed the suitability of a mass-producible anthelmintic <b>bait</b> for B. procyonis mitigation by evaluating the willingness of free-ranging raccoons to consume anthelmintic <b>baits</b> and determining whether <b>bait</b> consumption successfully cleared B. procyonis infections from raccoons. Anthelmintic <b>baits</b> were modified from standard fishmeal polymer <b>baits,</b> the food attractant commonly used in oral rabies vaccine <b>baits,</b> with the introduction of 220 mg of pyrantel pamoate into the fishmeal mixture. We captured 16 naturally infected raccoons, presented one anthelmintic <b>bait,</b> and monitored B. procyonis infection over 90 d by screening feces for eggs. Treatment cleared B. procyonis infections for nine of 12 raccoons that consumed 3 ̆e 10 g of the 15 g <b>bait.</b> We used remote cameras to monitor in situ patterns of <b>bait</b> consumption for anthelmintic <b>baits</b> relative to standard <b>baits.</b> Both anthelmintic and standard <b>baits</b> were rapidly consumed, with no differences in the rate of consumption between <b>bait</b> types. However, after <b>bait</b> contact, raccoons demonstrated a greater willingness to consume standard <b>baits</b> while ignoring anthelmintic <b>baits</b> more frequently (P= 0. 06). Initial trials of anthelmintic <b>baits</b> show promise, although refinement in both dose and palatability is needed. At mass production scales, the addition of pyrantel pamoate to fishmeal polymer <b>baits</b> would be inexpensive, potentially making anthelmintic <b>baits</b> a viable management option when coupled with an oral rabies vaccine or used independently for B. procyonis mitigation...|$|R
40|$|Research was {{conducted}} during 1996 – 2000 to develop <b>baits</b> for delivering an oral rabies vaccine to raccoons (Procyon lotor) and coyotes (Canis latrans). A <b>bait</b> was sought that: (1) was {{attractive to the}} target species, (2) could be distributed by aircraft, (3) was as effective (or more so) than the currently used fish meal polymer <b>bait,</b> and (4) could be produced in large numbers by automated procedures and could be purchased by user groups at substantially lower cost. Ten field trials were conducted to document raccoons’ <b>bait</b> flavor preferences, evaluate a new vaccine sachet <b>bait</b> coated with various attractants, and determine if the sachet <b>bait</b> would effectively deliver Raboral V-RG oral rabies vaccine (Merial Limited, Athens, Georgia, USA) to this species. Raccoons preferred fish and crustacean-based flavors over those derived from plant materials. Raccoon visits to tracking stations, frequency of <b>bait</b> removals, and percent of sachets discarded by this species that were emptied of placebo vaccine indicated efficacy of the new <b>bait</b> was equal or superior to the currently used fish meal polymer <b>bait.</b> A field trial conducted in fall 1998 compared aerially distributed vaccine-laden sachet and polymer <b>baits</b> and showed {{there was no difference}} between the percent of raccoons from the test and reference areas subsequently found positive for rabies antibody. Four <b>bait</b> trials to determine coyote response to sachet <b>baits</b> were conducted in 1997 – 98. The propensity for canids to gulp or bolt smaller food items is well known. Thus, a first trial involved offering fish-flavored sachet <b>baits</b> of different sizes to 30 captive coyotes to determine if smaller size <b>baits</b> were more frequently swallowed intact. Two field trials were also conducted in fall 1997 to determine if free-ranging coyotes discriminated among sachet <b>baits</b> coated with different attractants. Finally, Raboral V-RG-laden poultry-flavored sachet <b>baits</b> were aerially dropped and the percent of seropositive coyotes was compared with coyotes from surrounding areas where fish meal polymer vaccine <b>baits</b> had been distributed. Captive coyotes did not swallow sachet <b>baits</b> intact, regardless of size. <b>Bait</b> preference field trials indicated that coyotes preferred poultry, cheese/beef tallow, and fish-flavored sachet <b>baits</b> and that such <b>baits</b> were taken at the same rate as polymer <b>baits.</b> A sample of coyotes from the area <b>baited</b> with vaccine-laden sachet <b>baits</b> had a markedly higher (P = 0. 01) seropositivity rate than coyotes from areas where vaccine was distributed in polymer <b>baits.</b> Sachet <b>bait</b> production could be facilitated by automated technology and sachet <b>baits</b> used either as an alternative vaccine delivery device or in combination with the fish meal polymer <b>bait...</b>|$|R

40|$|Summary: Poisonous <b>baits</b> {{used for}} pest control in New Zealand {{commonly}} contain green dye and cinnamon oil {{to make them}} less attractive to birds. Research aimed at reducing the impact of poison based pest control on birds has shown that some birds are initially deterred from feeding on blue or, to a lesser extent, green coloured food and are attracted to yellow or red food. We determined whether colours that deter or attract birds affected the acceptance of non-toxic and toxic cereal <b>baits</b> by captive brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula). Individual possums were offered, daily, a choice between a standard green dyed non-toxic cereal <b>bait</b> and either a blue dyed (17 possums) or yellow dyed non-toxic <b>bait</b> (16 possums) for 10 days. Following this, for {{the first group of}} 17 possums, 1080 toxin was added to either the green <b>bait</b> (9 possums) or blue <b>bait</b> (8 possums) and possums were offered the green versus blue choice again. Two additional groups that had not previously been fed cereal <b>baits</b> were also given a choice between blue and green <b>baits,</b> one of which was toxic.

Similarly, providing nesting boxes has increased the number of barn owls in rice-growing areas of Malaysia where the rodents do much damage to the crop.
