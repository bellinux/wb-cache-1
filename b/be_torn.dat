5|$|The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) is {{assisting}} the coroner's office in investigating the two deaths. Once completed, the OPP could launch a criminal investigation, if warranted. The Ministry of Labour {{will have an}} engineer examine for further structural problems, and thus whether the mall needs to <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> down. Investigating {{the cause of the}} collapse is the city's responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Contractors in {{this type}} of {{construction}} faced many obstacles, both natural and man-made. They had to deal with rock formations and ground water, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, electric conduits, and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> up to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability.|$|E

5|$|The church did {{not want}} to sell its former home to just anyone, or for it to <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> down. At this time the city was looking for a space to use as an arts center. Plans for an arts and culture center in Hillsboro were made in the city’s Hillsboro 2020 Vision. This {{community}} plan was finalized in 2000 and designed to improve the livability of the city located in the Portland metropolitan area. Hillsboro purchased the property from the church for $1.325 million in November 2000.|$|E
5|$|This counter-punch drove Murat to {{seek the}} cover of allied Württemberger infantry. Barclay's reinforcements, however, were sent into the fray only to <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> to pieces by French artillery, leaving Friant's Division {{in control of the}} Russian forward {{position}} at 11:30. Dust, smoke, confusion, and exhaustion all combined to keep the French commanders on the field (Davout, Ney, and Murat) from comprehending that all the Russians before them had fallen back, were in confusion, and ripe for the taking.|$|E
5|$|AMI Stadium was {{significantly}} damaged during the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, with cracks in some stands and the playing surface badly damaged by liquefaction {{as well as}} damage to infrastructure and streets surrounding the venue. As {{a result of the}} damage all scheduled 2011 World Cup games to be held in Christchurch were moved to other regions. test rugby returned to Christchurch in 2012 at Rugby League Park. Although the stands at that venue were damaged severely enough that they had to <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> down, infrastructure damage was much less severe than at AMI Stadium, and the playing surface survived relatively intact. The stadium was rebuilt with a permanent capacity of 17,000, with temporary seating allowing for 9,000 more spectators.|$|E

50|$|The {{location}} of the plaza had been {{the site of the}} San Juan de Dios hospital which <b>was</b> <b>torn</b> down in 1850 and replaced by a railway station, which in turn <b>was</b> <b>torn</b> down between 1911 and 1918.|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} the first subway opened in 1904, the lines had been {{consolidated}} into two privately owned systems, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT, later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, BMT) and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). The city built most of the lines and leased them to the companies. The first line of the city-owned and operated Independent Subway System (IND) opened in 1932; this system was intended {{to compete with the}} private systems and allow some of the elevated railways to <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> down, but stayed within the core of the City due to its small startup capital. This required it to be run 'at cost', necessitating fares up to double the five-cent fare popular at the time.|$|E
5|$|In Elmhurst, the {{destruction}} of {{almost all of the}} century-old buildings {{in the heart of the}} village were destroyed for the construction of the subway. Land was taken on the west side of the Broadway to avoid the demolition of the Saint James Episcopal Church and the Reformed Church. Many nineteenth century residences and the Wandowenock Fire Company buildings had to <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> down. To allow the subway line to curve into Queens Boulevard from Broadway, the northeast corner of the two streets was removed, in addition to some stores and an old Presbyterian chapel. New buildings were built behind a new curb line once the subway was completed, bringing a new face to Elmhurst. The introduction of the subway stimulated local growth in Elmhurst. Commercial buildings and apartment houses replaced existing structures.|$|E
5|$|In San Francisco, a {{group of}} young men drive to an {{abandoned}} factory, and drug one of their members with LSD, leaving him to <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> apart by what he perceives to be a monster. Later, a large quantity of suspicious ash found in a nearby park is proven to be from human remains. A private investigative organisation, the Millennium Group, dispatches offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) to investigate the multiple homicide that led to this. Black believes that the victims were burnt alive; while chemical analysis of the ash leads the Group to the same factory.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{observations}} of accelerating expansion imply {{that more and}} more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our event horizon and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called phantom energy theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called Big Rip.|$|E
5|$|The Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge, {{the first}} bridge {{to connect the}} two towns, had become {{functionally}} obsolete. Its narrow road had only two lanes with no shoulders. Because of its location near a sharp bend in the Mississippi River, the bridge had become a hazard to river traffic; barges and towboats frequently collided with it. In 1994, a study concluded that a new bridge was needed and the old one should <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> down. Construction was begun in 2001 and the new bridge opened in 2010. In 2011, the process of removing the old bridge began.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a new, massive {{development}} plan was announced for Haifa's waterfront. According to the plan, the western {{section of the}} city's port will <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> down, and all port activity will be moved to the east. The {{west side of the}} port will be transformed into a tourism and nightlife center and a point of embarkation and arrival for sea travel through the construction of public spaces, a beach promenade, and the renovation of commercial buildings. The train tracks that currently bisect the city and separate the city's beach from the rest of Haifa will also be buried. A park will be developed on the border of the Kishon River, the refineries' cooling towers will be turned into a visitors' center, and bridges will lead from the port {{to the rest of the}} city. Massive renovations are also currently underway in Haifa's lower town, in the Turkish market and Paris Square, which will become the city's business center. In addition, the ammonia depository tank in the Haifa bay industrial zone will be dismantled, and a new one built in an alternative location.|$|E

5|$|More than 930,000policyholders in South Florida lost {{coverage}} after 11insurance companies went bankrupt, {{caused by}} more than 600,000insurance claims filed. This led the Florida Legislature to create new entities, such as the Joint Underwriting Association, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association, and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, {{in an effort to}} restore adequate insurance capacity. Stricter building codes were created in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. A survey by Tim Marshall and Richard Herzog of the Haag Engineer Company in Carrollton, Texas, highlighted several construction issues. On the roof of some homes, the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper, which could easily be ripped by straight line winds. At houses with shingled roofs, it was found that some of the shingles were stapled perpendicular to the long axis, also allowing them to <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> away. After the tiles or shingles were peeled off, the plywood and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather. Eventually, the plywood and the trusses suffered structural failure, leading to roof collapses.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the electromagnetic separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which {{came to be called}} Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. When the plant was started up for testing on schedule in October 1943, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because {{of the power of the}} magnets, and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December Groves ordered a magnet to be broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings.|$|E
5|$|Seals {{typically}} consume {{their prey}} underwater {{where it is}} swallowed whole. Prey that is too large or awkward is taken to the surface to <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> apart. The leopard seal, a prolific predator of penguins, is known to violently swing its prey back and forth until it is decapitated. The elaborately cusped teeth of filter-feeding species, such as crabeater seals, allow them to remove water before they swallow their planktonic food. The walrus is unique in that it consumes its prey by suction feeding, using its tongue to suck the meat of a bivalve out of the shell. While pinnipeds mostly hunt in the water, South American sea lions are known to chase down penguins on land. Some species may swallow stones or pebbles for reasons not understood. Though they can drink seawater, pinnipeds get most of their fluid intake from the food they eat.|$|E

5|$|This is a {{relatively}} peaceful event, nothing akin to a supernova, which the Sun {{is too small to}} undergo as part of its evolution. Any observer present to witness this occurrence would see a massive increase in the speed of the solar wind, but not enough to destroy a planet completely. However, the star's loss of mass could send the orbits of the surviving planets into chaos, causing some to collide, others to be ejected from the Solar System, and still others to <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> apart by tidal interactions. Afterwards, all that will remain of the Sun is a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, 54% its original mass but only the size of the Earth. Initially, this white dwarf may be 100times as luminous as the Sun is now. It will consist entirely of degenerate carbon and oxygen, but will never reach temperatures hot enough to fuse these elements. Thus the white dwarf Sun will gradually cool, growing dimmer and dimmer.|$|E
5|$|When {{the plant}} was started up for testing on {{schedule}} in November, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because {{of the power of}} the magnets and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December, Groves ordered a magnet broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings. The second Alpha I was not operational until the end of January 1944; the first Beta and first and third Alpha I's came online in March, and the fourth Alpha I became operational in April. The four Alpha II racetracks were completed between July and October 1944.|$|E
5|$|During the {{construction}} of residential housing and other buildings on the site in 1988–89, several underground sections of the bunker complex were uncovered by work crews. In April 1988, the East German government allowed several visits to the site by photo-journalists. Water was pumped out of the Vorbunker for four days before access could be made via the underground passageway which led from the Chancellery. The interior floor of the Vorbunker {{was covered with a}} muddy sludge from having been underwater for so many years. Old empty wine bottles were found {{on the floor of the}} kitchen and wine store room. Still present in the room next to the kitchen were the broken frames of the bunk beds used by the Goebbels children. At the end of the hallway were the stairs leading down to the Führerbunker. However, the men could go no further than the mid-landing, as the Führerbunker was still underwater and the ceiling beyond the doorway had collapsed due to the demolitions performed in 1947. After these inspections, work crews for the most part removed and destroyed the bunker complex. The Vorbunkers top and external walls were the first structures to <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> down. The construction of buildings in the area around the complex was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable. The emergency exit point for the Führerbunker (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park.|$|E
