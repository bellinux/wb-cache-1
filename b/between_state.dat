50|$|The {{scope of}} the Convention is limited. It applies only to {{treaties}} concluded <b>between</b> <b>states,</b> so it does not cover agreements <b>between</b> <b>states</b> and international organizations or between international organizations themselves, though if any of its rules are independently binding on such organizations, they remain so. It does apply, however, to treaties <b>between</b> <b>states</b> within an intergovernmental organization. However, agreements <b>between</b> <b>states</b> and international organizations, or between international organizations themselves, will be governed by the 1986 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties <b>between</b> <b>States</b> and International Organizations or Between International Organizations if it ever enters into force. Also, in treaties <b>between</b> <b>states</b> and international organizations, {{the terms of the}} Convention still apply <b>between</b> the <b>state</b> members. The Convention does not apply to agreements not in written form.|$|R

Edwards won 49.5percent of the vote to Sloo's 46percent, with the rest going to Hubbard.|$|E
5|$|Its {{northern}} boundary (Roosevelt Road) {{marks the}} end of consecutively named east-west streets. East-west streets north of Roosevelt Road have street names except <b>between</b> <b>State</b> Street and Michigan Avenue. There are two block-long 8th and 11th Streets and a four-block 9th Street. Most streets south of Roosevelt simply use street numbers. Streets in this neighborhood from 13th to 26th are mostly numbered. Cullerton St (20th Street) & Cermak Road (22nd Street) are two of the few named east-west cross streets. Numbering continues southward in Chicago into the upper hundreds at a pace of 8 blocks per mile.|$|E
5|$|Other, smaller areas {{proposed}} for inclusion are {{a group of}} brick houses, some of them blighted, along {{the south side of}} Washington Street between First Street Alley and River; a rowhouse and community garden on the corners of Adams Street and Second Street Alley; and another group of rowhouses along the west side of Fifth Street <b>between</b> <b>State</b> and Congress Streets.

At the time the district was established, they were occupied by large industrial buildings, both of which were later demolished and replaced by parking lots.|$|E
50|$|The International Court of Justice has {{jurisdiction}} in {{two types of}} cases: contentious issues <b>between</b> <b>states</b> in which the court produces binding rulings <b>between</b> <b>states</b> that agree, or have previously agreed, {{to submit to the}} ruling of the court; and advisory opinions, which provide reasoned, but non-binding, rulings on properly submitted questions of international law, usually {{at the request of the}} United Nations General Assembly.

5|$|Furthermore, {{the appeal}} did not engage foreign policy considerations. The treaty was a civil {{convention}} between two countries and {{an agreement to}} render mutual judicial assistance, and {{had nothing to do}} with foreign affairs other than that it was made <b>between</b> <b>state</b> parties. It also did not involve the policing of government conduct in international affairs, because it only implicated the procedures private litigants had to take to serve writs on defendants residing in Hong Kong. When interpreting the treaty, the Court only had to determine the domestic legal obligations of the respondents seeking to serve a writ out of jurisdiction. Thus, the issue of whether the treaty applied to Hong Kong was justiciable, and the Ministry's letter was not decisive on the matter.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the club's home {{moved from}} the Antônio Carlos to the newer and larger Estádio Independência. The season saw another Campeonato Mineiro triumph and the club's first European tour, in which it played ten games in five countries. The {{excursion}} happened {{at a time when}} there were neither regular national competitions in Brazil nor continental ones in South America, and followed soon after the traumatic Maracanazo. The tour and Atlético's results, many of which achieved under adverse weather conditions and snow, were seen by national sports media as a historic achievement for Brazilian football itself. The team, captained by Zé do Monte, was dubbed the Campeões do Gelo ("Ice Champions"), a title that is remembered in the club's official anthem. The club's success in the state competition continued in the 1950s, a decade that saw the rise of forward Ubaldo and five consecutive Campeonato Mineiro victories from 1952 to 1956. After another state league title in 1958, Atlético took part in the inaugural edition of the Taça Brasil in the following year, reaching the third round. The tournament, the country's first annual nationwide competition, was a cup contested <b>between</b> <b>state</b> league champions, originally created by the CBD to select Brazil's entrants in the newly formed Copa Libertadores.|$|E
5|$|On October 7, 1987, Collins {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to close a}} deficit <b>between</b> <b>state</b> contributions to the worker's compensation Special Fund and disbursements. The Special Fund was designated for payments to workers with occupational diseases and workers whose work-related injuries could not be traced to any single employer. A plan proposed by Democratic state senator Ed O'Daniel was expected to {{provide the framework for}} legislation considered in the session. Under O'Daniel's plan, additional revenue for the Special Fund would be raised by increasing assessments on worker's compensation premiums for 30 years. Assessments for coal companies were increased more than those on other businesses because the majority of the claims paid from the Special Fund were for black lung, a breathing disease common among coal miners; consequently, it was opposed by legislators from heavily coal-dependent counties. Nevertheless, after nine days of negotiations, a bill substantially similar to O'Daniel's original plan was approved by the legislature and signed by Collins.|$|E

5|$|The {{economy of}} Aarhus is {{predominantly}} knowledge and service based, {{strongly influenced by}} the University of Aarhus and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing. Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefiting from the large port and central position on the rail network. Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality. The municipality is home to 175,000 jobs with some 100,000 {{in the private sector}} and the rest split <b>between</b> <b>state,</b> region and municipality. The region is a major agricultural producer, with many large farms in the outlying districts. People commute to Aarhus {{from as far away as}} Randers, Silkeborg and Skanderborg and almost a third of those employed within Aarhus municipality commute from neighbouring communities. Aarhus is a centre for retail in the Nordic and Baltic countries with expansive shopping centres, the busiest commercial street in the country and a dense urban core with many speciality shops.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{project cost}} NOK1,814 million. The costs were {{distributed}} to NOK476 million for the Bømlafjord Tunnel, NOK433 million for the Stord Bridge, NOK336 million for the Bømla Bridge, NOK46 million for the Spissøy Bridge, NOK36 million for the Digernes Tunnel, NOK325 million for roadways and NOK172 for administration and common costs. The investment cost was split <b>between</b> <b>state</b> grants and NOK1,036 million in debt {{taken up by the}} toll company. When the project was passed by Parliament it had a budget of NOK1,260 million. The Office of the Auditor General of Norway criticized the Western Norway Public Roads Administration in 2001 for a total cost overrun of NOK900 million in three projects, the Triangle Link, the Lærdal Tunnel and parts of National Road 555. The majority of the cost overruns were tied to the Triangle Link. As a consequence, Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm stated that future large road investments would have an external quality assurance before being presented to Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Washington Park {{has been}} public {{property}} since the Dongan Charter was granted to Albany incorporating it as a city. The charter specified that all land not privately owned {{at the time}} became property of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty {{of the city of}} Albany, including the land that would become the site of Washington Park. A portion of the land was set aside for a structure built to house gunpowder in 1802, and in 1806 the areas between Willett and Knox streets, and <b>between</b> <b>State</b> Street and Madison Avenue, became the Middle Public Square. In 1800, the land west of Knox Street to Robin Street and south from State Street to Hudson Avenue was taken for a cemetery, which was apportioned into sections for each of Albany's churches. There were separate sections for African-Americans and for strangers. West of the cemetery was the alms-house farm and the penitentiary grounds. In 1809 the Middle Public Square was renamed Washington Square, and later the Washington Parade Ground. In 1868 the remains and headstones in the cemetery were removed and reinterred, most to Albany Rural Cemetery, and some to the cemeteries of other churches.|$|E

This intersection {{is next to}} Government House, the residence of the Governor of Maryland, and one block north of the Maryland State House. MD 70 heads northwest for two blocks as Bladen Street, a four-lane divided boulevard that passes <b>between</b> <b>state</b> office buildings, including the offices {{of members of the}} Maryland General Assembly. At Calvert Street, the highway's name changes to Roscoe Rowe Boulevard. A two-lane ramp splits from southbound MD 70 just south of {{the southern end of the}} highway's bridge over College Creek, the point at which maintenance responsibility changes from the city of Annapolis to the state. The highway passes between several sets of government offices, including the Maryland Court of Appeals and the Maryland State Archives, leading up to its intersection with MD 435 (Taylor Avenue). MD 70 passes to the east of Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium before crossing Weems Creek and leaving the city of Annapolis. The highway meets US 50 and US 301 (John Hanson Highway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. Beyond the interchange, MD 70 curves to the west and intersects Bestgate Road and Tidewater Colony Drive; the latter street leads to the historic home Howard's Inheritance. The highway continues along Bestgate Road and becomes a four-lane road with a center turn lane before reaching its northern terminus at an arbitrary point west of Compton Drive and Willie Drive. Bestgate Road continues west as a county highway toward the Annapolis Mall in the center of Parole.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1975 crisis, the Governor-General's {{power to}} dismiss a Prime Minister against the incumbent's will under Section 64 of the Constitution {{had never been}} exercised. Twice since Federation, {{conflicts}} <b>between</b> <b>state</b> premiers and state governors, who perform analogous functions to the Prime Minister and Governor-General respectively, at the state level, had resulted in the departure of one or the other. In 1916, New South Wales Premier William Holman was expelled from the Australian Labor Party for supporting conscription. He managed {{to hold on to}} power with the aid of opposition parties and consulted the Governor, Sir Gerald Strickland, proposing to pass legislation to extend the term of the lower house of the state legislature by a year. When Strickland objected, stating that such a course was unfair to Labor, Holman had him replaced. In 1932 the New South Wales Labor Premier, Jack Lang, refused to pay moneys owing to the Federal government, which froze the state's bank accounts, causing Lang to order that payments to the state government be only in cash. The governor, Sir Philip Game, wrote to Lang, warning him that ministers were breaking the law, and that if they continued, he would have to obtain ministers who could carry on government within legal bounds. Lang replied that he would not resign, and Game dismissed his government and commissioned the Leader of the Opposition, Bertram Stevens, to form a caretaker government pending a new election, in which Labor was defeated.|$|E
