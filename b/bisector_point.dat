50|$|A {{conical surface}} is {{generated}} by a line segment rotated about a <b>bisector</b> <b>point</b> such that the end points trace circles, each in its own plane. A cone, one branch of the double conical surface, is the surface with the point (apex or vertex), the circle (base), and the axis, a line joining vertex and center of base.|$|E
50|$|An angle {{bisector}} {{divides the}} angle into two angles with equal measures. An angle only has one <b>bisector.</b> Each <b>point</b> of an angle bisector is equidistant {{from the sides}} of the angle.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the structure of}} the <b>bisector</b> of <b>point</b> sites under arbitrary convex distance functions in three dimensions. Our results show that it is advantageous for analyzing bisectors to consider their central projection on the unit sphere, thereby reducing by one the dimension of the problem. From the concept of "silhouettes" and their intersections we obtain simple characterizations of important structural properties like the number of connected components of the bisector of three sites. Furthermore, we prove that two related bisectors of three sites may intersect in permuted order...|$|R
40|$|In this note, an {{approach}} combining dynamic geometry and automated deduction techniques {{is used to}} study the <b>bisectors</b> between <b>points</b> and curves. Usual teacher constructions for bisectors are discussed, showing that inherent limitations in dynamic geometry software impede their thorough study. We show that the interactive sketching of bisectors and an automatic treatment of the algebraic problem involved can give a reasonable knowledge about them. Since some cases are currently out of computational scope, despite {{the simplicity of the}} bisector problem, we sketch an alternative method for dealing with them...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to {{introduce}} new geometric constants that quantify the difference between Roberts orthogonality and Birkhoff orthogonality in normed planes. We start by characterizing Roberts orthogonality in two different ways: via <b>bisectors</b> of two <b>points</b> and using certain linear transformations. Each of these characterizations yields one of those geometric constants that we will study...|$|R
40|$|The {{bisector}} {{surface of}} two rational surfaces in IR is non-rational, in general. However, in some special cases, the bisector surfaces can have rational parameterization. This paper classifies {{some of these}} special cases {{that are related to}} constructive solid geometry (CSG). We consider the <b>bisector</b> surfaces between <b>points,</b> lines, planes, spheres, cylinders, cones, and tori. Many cases are shown to yield rational bisector surfaces, while several other cases are still left as open questions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLet S be {{a set of}} 2 n {{points in}} general {{position}} in the plane; then any line lying on two of these points and having n − 1 of the points of S {{on each side of}} it is called a bisector of S. We show that if p and q are distinct points of S having vp and vq bisectors on them, respectively, then vp + vq ⩽ 2 n. The development leading to this result is based upon a fundamental property concerning the relative positions of the <b>bisectors</b> on a <b>point.</b> The sum vp + vq + vτ is also discussed...|$|R
5000|$|The {{envelope}} of the infinitude of area bisectors is a deltoid (broadly {{defined as a}} figure with three vertices connected by curves that are concave to {{the exterior of the}} deltoid, making the interior points a non-convex set). The vertices of the deltoid are at the midpoints of the medians; all points inside the deltoid are on three different area <b>bisectors,</b> while all <b>points</b> outside it are on just one. http://www.se16.info/js/halfarea.htmThe sides of the deltoid are arcs of hyperbolas that are asymptotic to the extended sides of the triangle. The ratio of the area of the {{envelope of}} area bisectors to the area of the triangle is invariant for all triangles, and equals [...] i.e. 0.019860... or less than 2%.|$|R
40|$|This work generalizes {{the notion}} of Bresse's circles and shows {{that there are two}} {{infinite}} families of circles: - first, with each circle passes through the instantaneous center of rotation and instantaneous center of the accelerations, centered on their <b>bisector.</b> At each <b>point</b> of such a circle is constant angle between the direction of the velocity vector and the direction of the acceleration vector. - second, each circle whose center is on the right which passes through the instantaneous center of rotation and instantaneous center of the accelerations. At each point of such a circle is a constant relationship between the intensity of the velocity vector and the intensity of the acceleration vector. It's also shown a new method of graphical determining the acceleration in the plane movement, over- Bresse circles. Feature of this method is that it gives us direct normal and tangential acceleration relative {{to the center of the}} curve...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{comprehensive}} and accurate stress field equations for sharp rounded V-notches derived in Part I of this contribution, the microstructural support factor of these notches is determined which quantifies the fictitious notch radius in Neuber's elastic microstructural support concept. By means of Filippi's equations and considering different failure criteria (Rankine, von Mises and Beltrami) the fictitious notch radius is evaluated for different notch opening angles {{as a function of the}} actual notch radius and the microstructural support length. Plane stress and, alternatively, plane strain conditions are introduced. Once the fictitious radius has been found, the support factor s is derived from the expression: fictitious notch radius minus actual notch radius divided by microstructural support length. The support factor s is found to be very sensitive to the notch opening angle, but constant 'plateau values' are determined for all actual radius greater than the microstructural support length. The dependence of s on the failure criterion and the multiaxiality conditions (plane stress or plane strain) is also investigated. Various numerical analyses using the FE method have been carried out to compare the theoretical stress concentration factor to the effective stress concentration factor, the former obtained by considering fictitiously rounded notches under tension loading using the plateau values of s, the latter obtained by integrating the relevant stress over the microstructural support length along the <b>bisector</b> of the <b>pointed</b> V-notch. Finally, dealing with out-of-plane shear loading, Neuber's corresponding solution valid for sharp rounded notches is re-evaluated and the numerical analysis described above is extended to this loading case. All the comparisons above are preceded by elementary solutions for pointed notches in general. It is shown that the plateau values of s are well suited for engineering usage in structural strength assessments...|$|R
