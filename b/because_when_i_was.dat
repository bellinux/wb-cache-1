2500|$|The {{lyrics to}} this song follow {{a series of}} {{different}} themes, as Grohl noted himself, [...] "Oh, my God, that song's about 15 different things! The only reason why it's called 'Hey, Johnny Park!' is <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> young, my best friend was this kid who {{lived across the street}} from me called Johnny Park and we were like brothers from the age of 5 to 12. I haven't heard from him since I was about 14 years old and I thought if I named a song after him he might call." ...|$|E

[...] "From when I was 8 or 10 I {{knew it was going to}} be a career for me. [...] It's a tennis life so it wasn't so easy. [...] You have to give up many things. When all my friends were playing outside I had to practice. I didn't go to all the school trips. But I was focused from a very young age. I grew up {{practicing}} at the Jerusalem tennis center. I spent most of my childhood there, practicing five days a week. I never regretted it and I enjoyed every moment. Now I am reaping the rewards." ...|$|E

'We went there,' said Little Dorrit, {{glancing at}} her charge, 'because I like {{sometimes}} to know, {{of my own}} knowledge, that my sister is doing well; and {{like to see her}} there, with my own eyes, when neither she nor Uncle is aware. It is very seldom indeed that I can do that, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not out at work, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> with my father, and even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> out at work, I hurry home to him.

"Ay, if {{he stood}} alone; {{if he were}} even {{going to live in}} England; if he would let himself be himself; but public opinion," [...] sobbed the poor self-tormentor--"It has been his God, Sabina, to be a leader of taste and fashion--admired and complete--the Crichton of Newport and Brooklyn. And he could not bear scorn, the loss of society. Why should he bear it for me? If he {{had been one of the}} {{abolitionist}} party, it would have been different: but he has no sympathy with them, good, narrow, pious people, or they with him: he could not be satisfied in their society--or I either, for I crave after it all as much as he--wealth, luxury, art, brilliant company, admiration,--oh, inconsistent wretch, that <b>I</b> <b>am!</b> And that makes me love him all the more, and yet makes me so harsh to him, wickedly cruel, as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to-day; <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> reproving his weakness, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> reproving my own, and because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> angry with myself, I grow angry with him too--envious of him, I do believe at moments, and all his success and luxury!" ...|$|R

60|$|I, Hubert, with a mind full of fears, {{though not}} for myself, and a {{stirring}} {{of the blood}} such as was natural to my age at the approach of my first taste of battle, ran fast up to that house which I have described, and {{paused for a moment}} by the big elm tree that grew in front of the door, of which the lower boughs were sawn off because they shut out the light from the windows. I remember that elm tree very well, first <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a child starlings nested in a hole in the trunk, and I reared one in a wicker cage and made a talking bird of it which I kept for several years. It was so tame that it used to go about sitting on my shoulder, till at last, outside the town a cat frightened it thence, and before I could recapture it, it was taken by a hawk, which hawk I shot afterwards with an arrow out of revenge.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} wonder what I'm doing at Prospect Point. Well, I always like to spend a month of summer at the shore, and father insists that I come to his second-cousin Emily's 'select boardinghouse' at Prospect Point. So a {{fortnight}} ago I came as usual. And as usual old 'Uncle Mark Miller' brought me from the station with his ancient buggy and what he calls his 'generous purpose' horse. He is a nice old man {{and gave me a}} handful of pink peppermints. Peppermints always seem to me such a religious sort of candy--I suppose <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little girl Grandmother Gordon always gave them to me in church. Once I asked, referring to the smell of peppermints, 'Is that the odor of sanctity?' I didn't like to eat Uncle Mark's peppermints because he just fished them loose out of his pocket, and had to pick some rusty nails and other things from among them before he gave them to me. But I wouldn't hurt his dear old feelings for anything, so I carefully sowed them along the road at intervals. When the last one was gone, Uncle Mark said, a little rebukingly, 'Ye shouldn't a'et all them candies to onct, Miss Phil. You'll likely have the stummick-ache.' ...|$|E

As far as I can make out, if you roll in after a certain hour, the Johnnie in charge of the proceedings gives you the miss-in-baulk, and you have to turn up again next day. However, we shall be all right unless we have a breakdown, and there's not much chance of that. I've been tuning up the old car since seven this morning, and she's sound in wind and limb, absolutely. Oil--petrol--water--air--nuts--bolts--sprockets-- carburetter--all present and correct. I've been looking after them like a lot of baby sisters. Well, as I was saying, I've got the dope. A week ago I was just one of the mugs--didn't know a thing about it--but now! Gaze on me, laddie! You see before you old Colonel Romeo, the Man who Knows! It all started on the night of the ball. There was the dickens of a big ball, you know, to celebrate old Boots' coming-of-age--to which, poor devil, he contributed nothing but the sunshine of his smile, never having learned to dance. On that occasion a most rummy and extraordinary thing happened. I got pickled to the eyebrows!" [...] He laughed happily. [...] "I don't mean that that was a unique occurrence and so forth, <b>because,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a bachelor, it was rather a habit of mine to get a trifle submerged every now and again on occasions of decent mirth and festivity. But the rummy thing that night was that I showed it. Up till then, I've been told by experts, I was a chappie in whom it was absolutely impossible to detect the symptoms. You might get a bit suspicious if you found I couldn't move, but you could never be certain. On the night of the ball, however, I suppose I had been filling the radiator a trifle too enthusiastically. You see, I had deliberately tried to shove myself more or less below the surface in order to get enough nerve to propose to Alice. I don't know what your experience has been, but mine is that proposing's a thing that simply isn't within the scope of a man who isn't moderately woozled. I've often wondered how marriages ever occur in the dry States of America. Well, as I was saying, on the night of the ball a most rummy thing happened. I thought one of the waiters was you!" ...|$|E
60|$|Prince Dolgorouki and a Grand Admiral or two, whom we {{had seen}} {{yesterday}} at the reception, came on board also. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little distant with these parties, at first, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> visiting Emperors <b>I</b> {{do not like to}} be too familiar with people I only know by reputation, and whose moral characters and standing in society <b>I</b> can not <b>be</b> thoroughly acquainted with. I judged it best to be a little offish, at first. I said to myself, Princes and Counts and Grand Admirals are very well, but they are not Emperors, and one can not be too particular about who he associates with.|$|R

Without the brig <b>I</b> <b>am</b> disarmed, without me she can't strike. So Daman thinks. He does not know everything {{but he is not}} far off the truth. He says to himself that if I man the boats to go after these whites into the lagoon then his Illanuns will get the yacht for sure--and perhaps the brig as well. If I stop here with my brig he holds the two white men and can talk as big as he pleases. Belarab believes in me no doubt, but Daman trusts no man on earth. He simply does not know how to trust any one, because he is always plotting himself. He came to help me {{and as soon as he}} found <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not there he began to plot with Tengga. Now he has made a move--a clever move; a cleverer move than he thinks. Why? I'll tell you why. Because I, Tom Lingard, haven't a single white man aboard this brig I can trust. Not one. I only just discovered my mate's got the notion <b>I</b> <b>am</b> some kind of pirate. And all your yacht people think the same. It is as though you had brought a curse on me in your yacht. Nobody believes me. Good God! What have I come to! Even those two--look at them--I say look at them! By all the stars they doubt me! Me! [...] ." ...|$|R

6000|$|Duncan Campbell. No, {{he writes}} sometimes, but oftener he speaks with his fingers, and mighty swift; no man {{can do it}} so quick, or write half so soon; he has a little bell in his hand, like that which my mother makes me a sign to shake when she wants the servants: with that he tickles my brain strangely, and gives me an {{incredible}} delight of feeling in {{the inside of my}} head; he usually wakes me with it in the morning when he comes to make me an appointment. I fancy it is what you call hearing, which makes me mighty desirous I could hear in your way; it is sweeter to the feeling, methinks, than anything is to the taste; it is just as if my head was tickled to death, as my nurse used to tickle my sides; but it is a different feeling, for it makes things like little strings tremble in my temples and behind my ears. Now I remember, I will {{tell you what it is}} like, that makes me believe it is like your hearing, and that strange thing which you that can speak, call sound or noise: <b>because,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at church with my mother, who told me the bells could be heard ringing a mile off, as I was kneeling on the bench, and leaning over the top of the pew and gnawing the board, every time the man pulled the rope, I thought all my head beat as if it would come to pieces, but yet it pleased me methought, rather than pained me, and I would be always gnawing the board when the man pulled the rope, and I told my mother the reason: the feeling of that was something like the little bell, but only that made my head throb, as if it would break, and this tickles me, and makes, as it were, little strings on the back of my ears dance and tremble like anything; is not that like your way of hearing? If it be, it is a sweet thing to hear; it is more pleasant than to see the finest colours in the world; it is something like being tickled in the nose with a feather till one sneezes, or like the feeling after one strikes the leg when it has been numb, or asleep, only with this difference, that those two ways give a pain, and the other a pleasure. I remember, too, when I had a great cold, for about two months, I had a feeling something like it, but that was blunt, dull, confused, and troublesome. Is not this like what you call hearing? ...|$|E

5000|$|Speaking about Canada's {{homegrown}} comedy industry, Macdonald {{reflected that}} he would have liked there to have been more opportunity for him to stay in the country early in his career, stating: Now I know there's more of, like, an industry there.

But there wasn't that opportunity <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there. <b>I</b> remember Mike MacDonald had one short-lived series, but that was about it. Otherwise there was nothing to do. But it was great with standup. It was way, way better with standup than in the States.

So it was all standup and we just assumed we'd be standups for our whole lives and that was what was fun. And then <b>when</b> <b>I</b> came to the States, I realized, whoa, they don't take their standup very seriously here because they're just trying to do something other than standup and using standup as, like, a springboard to something else that they're generally not as good at.|$|R

His family neglected him, so he took that as license to really pamper himself. When he was legitimately sick, he actually felt good, because it was difficult and tiring to have to invent diseases but when he actually had something, he was relaxed." [...] Ruck said the role of Cameron had originally been offered to Emilio Estevez who turned it down. [...] "Every time I see Emilio, I want to kiss him", said Ruck. [...] "Thank you!"
