40|$|ABSTRACT Antibiotic X- 5108 {{is a new}} feed {{additive}} produced by Streptomyces goldiniensis developed exclusively for animal use. It is well tolerated by both chickens and turkeys, having an LDg,> 4000 mg. /kg. of body weight in both species. It has been extensively evaluated for efficacy in battery and floor pen trials with both chickens and turkeys. In 2 -week <b>broiler</b> <b>battery</b> trials, X- 5108 was effective in increasing growth and improving feed conversion over a range of 1 to 100 mg. /kg. of feed; and in 8 -week floor pen trials, it was active over a range of 5 to 50 mg. /kg. Comparable improvements in weight gain and feed conversion were seen in 8 -week battery and floor pen trials with X- 5108 at 5. 5 to 10 mg. /kg., lincomycin at 2. 2 to 4. 4 mg. /kg. and bambermycins at 10 mg. /kg. of feed. With poults, in 2 -week battery trials, X- 5108 was effective when fed over a range of 5 to 100 mg. /kg. In a 13 -week turkey floor pen trial, X- 5108 and zinc bacitracin were compared at 5, 10 and 25 mg. /kg.; X- 5108 was more effective at 25 mg. /kg. Based on these data, the estimated use level for X- 5108 would range from 1 to 10 mg. /kg. for chickens and 5 to 25 mg. /kg. for turkeys. Thus this new, safe, effective, low level poultry {{feed additive}} antibiotic meets the requirements of present-day growth promotants...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Accurate {{identification}} and optimal cultur-ing procedures for Campylobacter spp. from live broilers {{are needed for}} epidemiological studies. Because there is no standardized protocol, we designed and conducted studies to evaluate different selective media for the cultur-ing and isolation of Campylobacter spp. from cecal and fecal samples obtained from battery-reared and commer-cial broilers. Five media selective for Campylobacter were evaluated: Campylobacter agar base, Campylobacter, Campy-Line, modified Campy-Cefex, and modified char-coal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar. With contaminated <b>broilers</b> reared in <b>battery</b> cages, Campylobacter agar base, Campylobacter, modified Campy-Cefex, and modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar revealed similar isolation rates (P> 0. 05), whereas Campy-Line showed a lower efficacy (P < 0. 05).

40|$|ABSTRACT Studies were {{conducted}} to evaluate the availability of choline in soybean meal, using a new approach: The basal diet contained soybean meal with a lowered choline content (partially extracted with methanol).

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} availability of feed enzymes {{and a growing}} interest in soybean meal (SBM) carbohydrates, there is little information on the potential beneficial effects of dietary supplements of enzymes to increase nutritive value. Here we hypothesize {{that a combination of}} mannase (polysaccharidase) and protease enzymes could reduce the anti-nutritive effect described in soybean β-manans and consequently increase the degradability of carbohydrates and proteins in diets based on SBM. We assessed the effect of adding mannase and protease to a corn-SBM diet fed to <b>broiler</b> chicks in <b>batteries,</b> particularly on productive performance and nutrient digestibility. Our results showed that neither BW gain nor feed intake was affected. No consistent effects were observed with the individual enzymes (mannase or protease) on the ileal or fecal digestibility of crude protein and crude fat. However, organic matter digestibility and apparent metabolizable energy of diets tended to increase with mannase supplementation. Addition of this enzyme to the diet also reduced ileal microbial flora (as measured by purine base concentration), which indicated that feed enzymes might contribute to the prevention of digestive diseases...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} de-termine whether fluctuations in dietary electrolyte level (milliequivalents Na+K-Cl per kilogram) or different di-etary sodium chloride levels would affect performance, water intake, or excreta moisture of chickens fed semdur-amicin vs nonmedicated controls. In all experiments, male commercial broiler chicks were used, and all diets were fed with and without 25 mg semduramicin/kg diet. The basal diets were based on corn, soybean meal, and poul-try oil. Experiments 1, 3, and 4 were conducted using male <b>broiler</b> chicks in <b>battery</b> brooders to 18 d of age. In Experi-ment 1, six electrolyte levels were fed [basal (0. 2 % Na, 0. 33 % Cl, 1. 10 % K); basal plus 0. 1 % Na (from sodium chloride); basal plus 0. 1 % K (from potassium chloride); basal plus 0. 2 % Na (from sodium carbonate); basal plus 0. 34 % K (from potassium chloride); basal plus 0. 15 % Cl (from ammonium chloride) ]. There were no significant changes in BW gain, feed consumption, or feed conver-sion ratio caused by any dietary treatment. Water con-sumption was not affected by the inclusion of Na, Cl, K, or electrolyte levels, but excreta moisture was affected.

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate if the degree of activation of the microsomal mixed-function oxidase (MFO) system {{was related to the}} degree of growth depression associated with the addition of monensin to the diet. The {{experiments were}} conducted with <b>broiler</b> chicks in <b>battery</b> brooders in which the chicks were fed diets of various composition and containing monensin at 0 to 160 ppm. In all experiments, the activity of the MFO system was estimated by the change in the content of cytochrome P- 450 in the hepatic microsomes. Activities of some microsomal enzymes were also measured in some of the experiments. Feeding a diet with 24 % protein containing fish meal, alfalfa meal, and torula yeast significantly increased the activity of the MFO system in comparison with feeding an isonitrogenous and isoenergetic corn and soybean diet, but {{there was no difference between}} the diets in the toxicity of monensin as measured by growth rate.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of microbial or antimicrobial additives on the performance and organ morphology of <b>broilers</b> raised in <b>batteries</b> or in floor pens. The effect of microbial additives on the presence of oocysts in the litter was also studied. Experiments 1 and 2 consisted of four treatments (non-supplemented control diet or diet supplemented with avilamycin, bacitracin methylene disalicylate or enramycin) and six repetitions in a randomized block design. In Experiment 1, 288 day-old chicks were housed in heated batteries in a environmentally controlled room, 12 chicks per cage; in Experiment 2, 1, 200 day-old chicks were housed in a curtain-sided experimental house, with concrete floor and rice hulls as litter material, 50 chicks per pen. Experiments 3 and 4 were carried out similarly to Experiments 1 and 2, respectively, but the treatments consisted of microbial additives (non-supplemented control diet or Bacillus subtilis added to the feed plus Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus johnsonii added to the water, undefined microflora added to the water or live yeast added to the feed). The antibiotics did not affect the performance of birds raised in batteries, but improved feed conversion, weight gain and live weight when chickens were kept on the floor pens. Microbial additives did not affect bird performance in any environment; however, treatments affected liver weight. Microbial agents increased intestinal weight in floor-raised broilers.

The objective {{was to determine if}} NSPase inclusion enhances phytase activity in relation to growth parameters and bone ash in <b>broilers</b> reared in <b>batteries</b> through 14 days of age. Four diets with selected available phosphorus levels of 0. 15, 0. 20 %, 0. 25 % and 0. 30 % were included in the experimental design to develop a dose response curve to calculate phosphorus release from experimental treatments. An addition six treatments were included that included three levels of phytase (150, 200 and 250 FTU/kg) with and without NSPase inclusion in a diet containing 0. 15 % available phosphorus. Evaluated parameters included body weight, feed conversion ratio and bone ash percentage. Body weight and bone ash percentage were positively influence with increases in available phosphorus levels. Phytase inclusion positively influenced growth performance and bone ash percentage. Broilers fed the 200 and 250 FTU/kg phytase inclusion levels outperformed the broilers fed the 150 FTU/kg inclusion level. Addition of NSPase with 150 FTU/kg phytase resulted in increased broiler body weight as compared to the 150 FTU/kg phytase diet alone. Using regression equations determined from dose response treatments for body weight, bone ash (mg) and bone ash percentage, NSPase inclusion increase phosphorus release at the 150 FTU/kg level from a 0. 06 % to 0. 09 %.
