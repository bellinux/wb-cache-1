40|$|In {{this study}} the wear {{behavior}} of brass, gun metal and Cast Nylon based <b>Bushing</b> <b>bearing</b> in wet conditions {{at a speed}} of 900 rpm. The wear test of these bearing was performed in new wear testing machine. The wear test were carried out under different loads like 10 N, 20 N, 30 N and fixed speed of the motor at 900 rpm. The Lubricant used for the test is SAE#) and it is used for all test. The wear characteristics were determined with respect to load, shaft speed and time. The main objective {{of the study is}} to evaluate the wear rate of different journal bearings at different loading conditions. The main objective of this experimental study was to checked and compares conventional bearing materials with respect to new bearing material name Cast Nylon. It was found that because of co-efficient of friction, the power loss due to friction was five times in Brass and 2. 5 Times in Gun Metal compare to Cast Nylon, comparing at the same speed, load and lubricant. Even density of the Brass and Gun Metal is approximately seven times heavier than the Cast Nylon. Therefore, we can replace conventional bearing made either from the Brass or Gunmetal by the new material name Cast Nylon and improve the performance of the engine bearing by way of reducing power loss and less induced temperature due to lower value of co-efficient of friction...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} to examine the feasibility of using an ankle joint capable of simulating the plantar flexion deformation mechanism experienced by the human foot during the interaction with the soccer ball. A foot geometry was used to allow soccer boots to be fitted to the end-effector with a semi-bonded <b>bush</b> <b>bearing</b> to act as the ankle joint. The bearing provides a torsional resistance to radial loading, returning the foot to its starting position after the foot and ball impact. High speed video analysis using the GOM PONTOS system created three dimensional data points from markers placed on the end-effector, resulting in the relative rotations being quantified. Similarities between the plantar flexion mechanism in human kicking and the end-effector were observed, with a greater magnitude experienced by the end-effector. The end-effector provided repeatable foot rotations when struck with different initial foot velocities. The study concluded that a semi-bonded <b>bush</b> <b>bearing</b> can be used as an ankle joint to create repeatable contact between a foot geometry and a soccer ball.

It is used to support radial loads under high speed operating conditions. During this transient period, direct contact between the journal and bearing induces high friction and bushes become progressively worn-out, thus inducting certain disabilities. The bushes are provided with a lining thickness of Cu-Pb-Sn material which is found in the range of 450 to 600 micron. The aim of present experimental work is to determine effect of variable load, speed and acceleration on depth of wear of lining thickness (dw) of Cu-Pb-Sn material bush, which is widely used as bush material in automobile engine.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the bearing design {{and analysis of}} radial semi-floating <b>bush</b> oil lubricated <b>bearings</b> for a typical industrial turbocharger configuration. Initially, the stability analysis for a linear rotor/bearing system is evaluated through eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The stiffness and damping coefficients of the inner oil film are obtained for the linear modeling process. The operating speed range of the turbocharger is high enough, at 21, 000 to 24, 000 rpm, to be unstable, indicating that the analysis should be and is carried out with nonlinear transient modeling. The nonlinear transient analysis evaluates the rotor and bush limit cycle orbits, rotor dynamics, the forces acting on the rotor and semi-floating bush surfaces, the oil flow through the bearing, the oil temperatures, and the power loss of the two oil films. The optimum design {{of a set of}} semi-floating <b>bush</b> <b>bearings</b> for this application depends strongly upon the clearances of the bush and squeeze film damper, usually expressed as the non-dimensional clearance to radius ratio. A typical clearance is evaluated to determine the bearing performance in terms of orbit size, forces acting on the bush and squeeze damper surfaces, oil flow through the bearing, power loss, and thermal heating. The nonlinear transient orbit values are evaluated for frequency content using the FFT to determine which orbits show both the synchronous and sub-synchronous vibration components and the associated rotor modes excited. These results are compared to the linear analysis over the operating speed range. The oil flow through the bearing component is much larger than the squeeze film damper. The forces acting on the bush and squeeze damper surfaces are related to the fatigue life of the bearing...|$|R
