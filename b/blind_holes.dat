25|$|Thread forming is {{performed}} using a , or , which closely resembles a cutting tap without the flutes. There are lobes periodically spaced around the tap that actually do the thread forming as the tap is advanced into a properly sized hole. Since the tap does not produce chips, {{there is no need}} to periodically back out the tap to clear away chips, which, in a cutting tap, can jam and break the tap. Thus thread forming is particularly suited to tapping <b>blind</b> <b>holes,</b> which are tougher to tap with a cutting tap due to the chip build-up in the hole. Note that the tap drill size differs from that used for a cutting tap and that an accurate hole size is required because a slightly undersized hole can break the tap. Proper lubrication is essential because of the frictional forces involved, therefore a lubricating oil is used instead of cutting oil.|$|E

50|$|A <b>blind</b> <b>hole</b> {{refers to}} a hole that is reamed, drilled, or milled to a {{specified}} depth without breaking through {{to the other side}} of the workpiece. The etymology is that it is not possible to see through a <b>blind</b> <b>hole.</b> Other types of holes also include through holes, and clearance holes. In this instance blind may also refer to any feature that is taken to a specific depth, more specifically referring to internally threaded hole (tapped holes). Not considering the drill point, the depth of the <b>blind</b> <b>hole,</b> conventionally, may be slightly deeper than that of the threaded depth.|$|R

At present, we commonly used electrical discharge machining and welding method to solve the problem. However, these methods have the low processing efficiency, low manufacturing precision and high cost defect. This paper developed an inner wall of the <b>blind</b> <b>hole</b> drilling device, similar to a stand-alone machine accessories, adopted the bevel gear transmission. which can directly mounted on vertical or horizontal milling machine, with {{a few minutes to}} complete the processing operations.

Longer pins will deflect more and be pushed by {{the pressure of the}} molten plastic material during molding. It is recommended that hole depth-to-diameter ratio should not be more than 2.|$|E
50|$|When {{two pieces}} of wood are {{to be joined by}} dowels {{embedded}} in <b>blind</b> <b>holes,</b> there are numerous methods for aligning the holes. For example, pieces of shot may be placed between the wood pieces to produce indentations when the pieces are clamped together; after the clamp is released, the indentations indicate the center points for drilling. Dowel centers are simple and inexpensive tools for aligning opposing <b>blind</b> <b>holes.</b> Various commercial systems, such as Dowelmax, have been devised to solve this problem.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{scattering}} {{problem of}} an incident high-frequency S 0 Lamb wave in a {{plate with a}} circular <b>blind</b> <b>hole</b> is investigated. The study {{is not limited to}} the low-frequency range of this wave, in which the popular approximate plate theories are inapplicable. A 3 D analytical approach is used where the wave fields are expanded in all possible Lamb modes, including propagating and evanescent modes. Due to the non-symmetric <b>blind</b> <b>hole</b> defect, the scattered fields will contain higher order converted modes in addition to the fundamental S 0 and A 0 modes. The far field scattering amplitudes of various propagating Lamb modes for different hole sizes are inspected. The results are compared with those of low frequencies and some different phenomena are found...|$|R

50|$|With soft or average {{hardness}} materials, such as plastic, aluminum or mild steel, {{the common}} practice {{is to use}} an intermediate (plug) tap to cut the threads. If the threads are to extend {{to the bottom of}} a <b>blind</b> <b>hole,</b> the intermediate (plug) tap will be used to cut threads until the point of the tap reaches bottom, after which a bottoming tap will be used to finish the hole. Frequent ejection of the chips must be made in such an operation to avoid jamming and possibly breaking the tap. With hard materials, the machinist may start with a taper tap, whose less severe diameter transition reduces the amount of torque required to cut the threads. If threads are to be cut to the bottom of a <b>blind</b> <b>hole,</b> the taper tap will be followed by an intermediate (plug) tap and then a bottoming tap to finish the operation.|$|R
50|$|Watts Brothers Tool Works {{is a tool}} {{manufacturer}} located in Wilmerding, Pennsylvania. They are known for manufacturing drill bits that can drill square holes, including <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> which cannot be made with other methods such as broaching. The Harry Watts square drill bit {{is based on a}} Reuleaux triangle shape, and is used together with a guide and a special chuck to make a square hole. Similarly, the company also manufactures drill bits for other angular holes such as pentagons and hexagons.|$|E
5000|$|Because boring {{is meant}} to {{decrease}} the product tolerances on pre-existing holes, several design considerations apply. First, large length-to-bore-diameters are not preferred due to cutting tool deflection. Next, through holes are preferred over <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> (holes that do not traverse {{the thickness of the}} work piece). Interrupted internal working surfaces—where the cutting tool and surface have discontinuous contact—are preferably avoided. The boring bar is the protruding arm of the machine that holds the cutting tool(s), and must be very rigid.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are various}} types of boring. The boring bar may be {{supported}} on both ends (which only works if the existing hole is a through hole), {{or it may be}} supported at one end (which works for both through holes and <b>blind</b> <b>holes).</b> Lineboring (line boring, line-boring) implies the former. Backboring (back boring, back-boring) is the process of reaching through an existing hole and then boring on the [...] "back" [...] side of the workpiece (relative to the machine headstock).|$|E
50|$|A through hole, also {{thru-hole}} or clearance hole, {{refers to}} a hole that is reamed, drilled, milled etc., completely through the material of an object. In other words, a through hole is a hole that {{goes all the way}} through something. This is to distinguish it from a <b>blind</b> <b>hole,</b> which does not go {{all the way through the}} material of the object.|$|R

50|$|The first length {{standards}} {{to use this}} technique were rectangular section solid bars. A <b>blind</b> <b>hole</b> was bored at each end, to {{the depth of the}} neutral plane, and the calibration marks were made at this depth.

50|$|The biggest {{disadvantage}} of core drill or annular cutter {{is that it}} can not drill <b>blind</b> <b>holes.</b> A core drill due to its hollow geometry can only make through holes. Another disadvantage is in drilling a pile of many plates. There are some core drills with a different geometry which can be used for drilling piles of plates, but still it is not 100% successful. The cost of a core drill is high compared to twist drill, but the cost per hole made with core drill is less as compared to twist drills, this is because a single core drill makes 5 to 10 times more holes than a twist drill.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} type of power driven tap is the [...] "spiral point" [...] plug tap, whose cutting edges are {{angularly}} displaced relative to the tap centerline. This feature causes the tap to continuously break the chip and eject it forward into the hole, preventing crowding. Spiral point taps are usually used in holes that go {{all the way through the}} material, so that the chips can escape. Another version of the spiral point plug tap is the spiral flute tap, whose flutes resemble those of a twist drill. Spiral flute taps are widely used in high speed, automatic tapping operations due to their ability to work well in <b>blind</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Screws: Threads {{have a high}} {{surface area}} and tend to [...] "trap" [...] gases, and therefore, are avoided. <b>Blind</b> <b>holes</b> are {{especially}} avoided, due to the trapped gas {{at the base of}} the screw and slow venting through the threads, which is commonly known as a [...] "virtual leak". This can be mitigated by designing components to include through-holes for all threaded connections, or by using vented screws (which have a hole drilled through their central axis or a notch along the threads). Vented Screws allow trapped gases to flow freely from the base of the screw, eliminating virtual leaks and speeding up the pump-down process.|$|E

5000|$|Single-point threading, {{where the}} {{workpiece}} is rotated, and a pointed cutting tool is {{fed into the}} workpiece {{at the same rate}} as the pitch of the internal thread. Single-pointing inside a <b>blind</b> <b>hole,</b> like boring inside one, is inherently more challenging than doing so in a through hole. This was especially true in the era when manual machining was the only method of control. Today, CNC makes these tasks less stressful, but nevertheless still more challenging than with through holes.|$|R
