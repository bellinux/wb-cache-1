5|$|Achievements in gliding have <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> by the {{awarding}} of badges since the 1920s. For the lower badges, such as the first solo flight, national gliding federations set their own criteria. Typically, a bronze badge shows preparation for cross-country flight, including precise landings and witnessed soaring flights. Higher badges follow the standards set down by the Gliding Commission of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).|$|E
5|$|By 1946, the Canby-Oregon portion had <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> as Sign Route 139, {{connecting}} with Oregon Route 39; it was extended south over US 299 to Adin and Routes 216 and 20 to Susanville by 1960. The number was legislatively adopted, replacing Routes 210 and 216, in the 1964 renumbering. It {{has remained a}} two-lane road, despite being added to the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 (Canby to Oregon) and 1965 (Susanville to Adin).|$|E

5|$|Mizanin largely {{dropped out}} of world title {{contention}} after 2011, and the period of 2012 to 2017 has <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> by him winning the Intercontinental Championship seven times, which made him the 25th Triple Crown Champion in company history and the 14th Grand Slam Champion. He is also the third longest-reigning Intercontinental Champion in WWE history by combined days, behind only Don Muraco and Pedro Morales.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{but later}} rumours {{included}} that {{during her first}} voyage, Centaur had transported soldiers to New Guinea, or Japanese prisoners of war back to Australia for interrogation, and consequently had <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> as a legitimate target by the Japanese. Centaur had carried 10 prisoners of war on her return voyage from New Guinea, but as they were all wounded personnel, transporting them on a hospital ship was legal.|$|E
5|$|The actual rock has <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> {{with over}} 100 {{distinct}} carvings, 66 {{of which are}} the full names of contemporary patients. Other carvings include initials, names, and dates. Prior to widespread vaccination, the treatment at Hospital Rock was extremely important. Hospital Rock was no longer needed when the smallpox vaccination was available and eventually faded away into the woods.|$|E

5|$|The period since Madsen's {{monograph}} has <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> {{by a great}} {{expansion in}} studies dealing with topics concerning Allosaurus in life (paleobiological and paleoecological topics). Such studies have covered topics including skeletal variation, growth, skull construction, hunting methods, the brain, {{and the possibility of}} gregarious living and parental care. Reanalysis of old material (particularly of large 'allosaur' specimens), new discoveries in Portugal, and several very complete new specimens have also contributed to the growing knowledge base.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> {{as a place}} for {{expansion}} since the 1960s and appeared on several Government plans for growth. Changes have included the County Square shopping centre, the redevelopment of the Templer Barracks at Repton Park, and the award-winning Ashford Designer Outlet. In the 1970s, a controversial ring road scheme and construction of the multi-storey Charter House building destroyed significant parts of the old town, though some areas were spared and preserved.|$|E
5|$|To {{the south}} are Dinas Bach and Dinas Mawr, twin peninsulas formed from {{weathered}} pillow lavas 600million years old, {{thought to have been}} early fortified sites from the Iron Age. Kittiwakes, cormorants and shags can be seen on the cliffs, while farm birds such as the yellowhammer frequent the gorse. On Mynydd Anelog, experimental plots have <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> out to monitor different methods of managing heather to discover the best way the habitat can be conserved for the future.|$|E

5|$|A {{promotion}} came in c. 46, when Alexander {{was appointed}} procurator of Judea by Claudius. The province {{had returned to}} direct Roman rule only {{after the death of}} Agrippa in 44, and the tenure of Alexander's predecessor Cuspius Fadus had <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> by unrest, so Alexander's Jewish background may have marked him as a more acceptable governor. Less trouble is attested during his office, although he did condemn James and Simon, sons of an earlier rebel named Judas of Galilee, to crucifixion. It was also at this time that Judea was afflicted by a severe famine. In 48 he was succeeded by Ventidius Cumanus.|$|E
5|$|Anniversaries of Linnaeus' birth, {{especially}} in centennial years, have <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> by major celebrations. Linnaeus {{has appeared on}} numerous Swedish postage stamps and banknotes. There are numerous statues of Linnaeus in countries around the world. The Linnean Society of London has awarded the Linnean Medal for excellence in botany or zoology since 1888. Following approval by the Riksdag of Sweden, Växjö University and Kalmar College merged on 1 January 2010 to become Linnaeus University. Other things named after Linnaeus include the twinflower genus Linnaea, the crater Linné on the Earth's moon, a street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the cobalt sulfide mineral Linnaeite.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{migration}} routes {{have been}} studied {{by a variety of}} techniques including the oldest, marking. Swans have <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> with a nick on the beak since about 1560 in England. Scientific ringing was pioneered by Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen in 1899. Other techniques include radar and satellite tracking. The rate of bird migration over the Alps (up to a height of 150 m) was found to be highly comparable between fixed-beam radar measurements and visual bird counts, highlighting the potential use of this technique as an objective way of quantifying bird migration.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, the ATC made {{progress}} toward protecting the trail from development, thanks to efforts {{of politicians and}} officials. The National Trails System Act of 1968 designated the Pacific Crest Trail and Appalachian Trail as the first national scenic trails and {{paved the way for}} a series of National Scenic Trails within the National Park and National Forest systems. Trail volunteers worked with the National Park Service to map a permanent route for the trail, and by 1971 a permanent route had <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> (though minor changes continue to this day). By the close of the 20th century, the Park Service had completed the purchase of all but a few miles of the trail's span.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} {{independence}} in 1960, the Trust Territory of Somalia established a national army {{to defend the}} nascent Somali Republic's borders. A law to that effect was passed on 6 April 1960. Thus the Somali Police Force's Mobile Group (Darawishta Poliska or Darawishta) was formed. 12 April 1960 has since <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> as Armed Forces Day. British Somaliland became independent on 26 June 1960 as the State of Somaliland, and the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somaliland) followed suit five days later. On 1 July 1960, the two territories united to form the Somali Republic.|$|E
5|$|Sites in Africa have <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> as such for {{a variety}} of reasons, such as {{deforestation}} and hunting, civil war, threats to and hostage taking of reserve staff, oil and gas projects and mining, declines in biodiversity, and structural damage to buildings. Three sites were formerly declared as being in danger, but have since lost the status: the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (19841989), the Rwenzori Mountains National Park (19992004), and Tipasa (20022006). The Garamba National Park and Timbuktu have also lost their statuses in 1992 and 2005, respectively, but later regained it in 1996 and 2012. Despite its large number of endangered sites and the circumstances surrounding them, African World Heritage Sites have never been stripped of their title, something that has only occurred twice.|$|E

5|$|The 1989 Draft {{has been}} noted as having been {{exceptionally}} successful for Detroit. While team executive Jim Devellano stated the team would be satisfied with two players from that draft {{making it to the}} NHL, seven of them did so. Those seven players (Mike Sillinger, Bob Boughner, Lidstrom, Fedorov, Shawn McCosh, Dallas Drake and Vladimir Konstantinov) amassed 5,995 games played, 1,227 goals, 2,367 assists, 3,594 points and 5,108 penalties in minutes. That draft has also <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> as signalling a paradigm shift for Detroit as prior to that the club was very reluctant to draft players from outside North America. Since then the club has drafted a large number of European as well as other non-North American players. In 2000, for example, they drafted four Swedes, three Russians, two Canadians, one Slovak and one American.|$|E
5|$|The Ashford Green Corridor is {{a linear}} park {{alongside}} {{the two main}} rivers through the town, which is protected from development by lying on the main flood plain. Most of the area covered by the park has <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> by Ashford Borough Council as a nature reserve. This area includes Victoria Park, which lies to the immediate south of the town centre and the railway. It includes an ornate fountain first shown at the 2nd International Exhibition in London in 1862, and presented to the park by George Harper on 24 July 1912. The Coningbrook Lakes Country Park opened on a former quarry site to the northeast of town in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Collins-class {{submarines}} {{experienced a}} wide range of problems during their construction and early service life. Many of these were attributed to the submarines being a new, untested design, and were successfully addressed as they were discovered. Most systems and features worked with few or no problems, while the boats' maximum speed, manoeuvrability, and low-speed submerged endurance were found to exceed specifications. The ship control system, which during development had <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> as a major potential problem, functioned beyond positive expectation: for example, the autopilot (which aboard Collins was nicknamed 'Sven') was found to be better at maintaining depth during snorting than most helmsmen.|$|E
