40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} {{determine}} how policy and environmental barriers affect international trade, using data at 4 -digit HS. The authors estimate a modified gravity equation, controlling for remoteness, for eight sectors in 10 Asian countries. Looking {{at the impact}} of the 'non-price' and 'price' factors on international trade, this paper finds that country's tariff, infrastructure quality and transport costs are the main three determinants for cross-country variations of trade flows. The major findings of the paper can be summarised as follows: (i) <b>bilateral</b> <b>infrastructure</b> quality is a principal determinant of trade performance, (ii) bilateral tariffs, which are largely ignored in the empirical gravity literature in context of Asia, has an impact on trade, (iii) the bilateral transport costs strongly influence the trade flows, and (iv) except transport equipment, trade in all other manufacturing sectors, considered in this study, are influenced by tariffs, transport costs and infrastructure quality. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} foreign direct investment (FDI) using a panel of bilateral outward FDI stocks of 19 OECD countries in Turkey between 1982 and 2007. Employing a knowledge-capital model, this study finds that joint national incomes, per capita difference, investment liberalisation {{and the cost of}} exporting to Turkey have significant effects on FDI in Turkey. In addition, the prospect of European Union membership, government stability, <b>infrastructure,</b> <b>bilateral</b> exchange rate, exchange rate volatility and openness to trade {{play an important role in}} determining the amount of FDI in Turkey. Finally, this study finds that high relative unit labour costs and corruption provide stimuli to FDI. ...|$|R

Moreover, this study finds that high relative unit labour costs and corruption provide stimuli to FDI. Using an augmented gravity model to investigate the relationship between FDI and imports, this study finds that outward FDI stocks are positively related to the exports. Overall, the empirical results indicate that FDI in Turkey is mainly motivated by market access and sensitive to the quality of institutions...|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between Jordan and the United States (US) {{in the field of}} nuclear energy cooperation. Since 2010 the Jordanian government has accelerated its plans for a nuclear energy program and has engaged with multiple partners around the world in order to agree terms for cooperation in technology exchange, monitoring, and the construction of <b>infrastructure.</b> <b>Bilateral</b> negotiations between the US and Jordan for a " 123 " nuclear cooperation agreement were underway by early 2008, but were suspended in 2011 without an agreement being reached. Jordanian nuclear energy policy has been spurred by energy security considerations (as it currently imports 97 percent of its energy needs) and the discovery of up to 120, 000 tonnes of uranium ore in Jordan. At the same time, the US is primarily interested in management of nuclear technology proliferation. This work considers the perceptions of self and other in Jordanian and US policymaking in order to understand why bilateral cooperation has not materialized and what this means for nuclear proliferation in Jordan. This study finds that the US–Jordanian negotiations have been impeded by contradictory objectives and perceptions, and a " 123 " agreement is not likely in the short to medium term, but that development of Jordan’s nuclear energy program will likely continue regardless...|$|R
