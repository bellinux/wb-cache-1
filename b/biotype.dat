Repolarization was not observed in herbicide-susceptible L. rigidum, nor was it observed in <b>biotypes</b> resistant to triazine, triazole, triazinone, phenylurea, or sulfonylurea herbicides but not resistant to aryloxyphenoxypropionates and cyclohexanediones. Chlorsulfuron, a sulfonylurea herbicide, at a saturating concentration of 1 micromolar, reduced membrane polarity in all <b>biotypes</b> studied by only 15 millivolts. The recovery of membrane potential following the removal of chlorsulfuron was restricted to chlorsulfuron-susceptible and -resistant <b>biotypes</b> that did not exhibit diclofop resistance. These differences in membrane responses are correlated with resistance to dicloflop rather than with resistance to chlorsulfuron. It is suggested that the differences may reflect altered membrane properties of diclofop-resistant <b>biotypes.</b> Further circumstantial evidence for dissimilarity of properties of membranes from diclofop-resistant and diclofop-susceptible ryegrass is provided by observations that K+/Na+ ratios were significantly higher in coleoptiles from diclofop-resistant <b>biotypes</b> than in coleoptiles from susceptible plants. Intact and excised roots from susceptible <b>biotypes</b> were capable of acidifying the external medium, whereas roots from resistant <b>biotypes</b> were unable to do so.
