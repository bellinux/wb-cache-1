5|$|Little {{is known}} about Shvarn and his rule, but historians <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unable {{to take control of}} all Lithuania, and ruled only over its {{southern}} portions. He died in 1269 or 1271 in Galicia.|$|E
5|$|In {{research}} following Hitler's death, {{a variety}} of claims have been made about Hitler's sexual orientation: that he was gay, bisexual, or asexual. Conclusive evidence is lacking, but most historians <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> heterosexual. There {{is at least one}} claim that Hitler had an illegitimate child (named Jean-Marie Loret) with one of his lovers. Mainstream historians, such as Ian Kershaw, dismiss this as unlikely or impossible.|$|E
5|$|In {{the story}} {{explored}} in Konquest mode, {{a young man}} named Shujinko is deceived into spending his entire life collecting the Kamidogu for Onaga, who uses the guise of an emissary of the Elder Gods, the beings who created the realms, named Damashi. Onaga reveals his identity and intentions after Shujinko has gathered all the Kamidogu. Shujinko, led to <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> working for the greater good, decides to continue training to defeat Onaga.|$|E

50|$|Despite his prodigious arcane talents, Camber {{repeatedly}} expresses {{his frustration}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not born a Healer. Camber is a modest man whose faked death forces him {{to conceal his}} irritation and frustration with his admirers who <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a saint and pursue his canonization. Camber firmly <b>believes</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> unworthy of such status.|$|R

5|$|Some of Swaminarayan's {{followers}} <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an {{incarnation of}} Lord Krishna. The images and stories of Swaminarayan and Krishna have coincided {{in the liturgy}} of the sect. The story {{of the birth of}} Swaminarayan parallels that of Krishna's birth from the scripture Bhagavata Purana. Swaminarayan himself is said to have intimated that he was a manifestation of God in a meeting with Reginald Heber, the Lord Bishop of Calcutta, in 1825.|$|E
5|$|Nathan Johnson {{was charged}} with simple {{possession}} of methamphetamine and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and received a $10,000 bond at a bond hearing. Some media outlets said the low bond amount indicated authorities did not <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> capable of assassinating Obama. On December 16, 2008, Johnson pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a weapon by a prohibited person. Johnson {{was released from the}} Englewood Federal Correctional Institution on March 4, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Sharp's {{role in the}} Relief Party's plan {{to abolish}} the old court {{and replace it with}} a new, more {{favorable}} court is not known. As he was the administration's chief legal counsel, historians <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> closely involved. He is known to have issued the order for Old Court clerk Achilles Sneed to turn over his records to New Court clerk Francis P. Blair. By practicing as state attorney general before the New Court to the exclusion of the Old Court, Sharp provided it a measure of legitimacy.|$|E

5|$|A {{local radio}} show {{schedules}} {{an interview with}} Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to discuss Dunder Mifflin, but, unbeknown to Dwight, the interview is later canceled. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) suggests they all use this to their advantage, and stage an interview for Dwight's benefit. Dwight believes he is talking to the interviewer through {{the phone in the}} break room, but is actually talking to Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) who is using an American accent. They convince him that the information he is giving leads to a hostage situation with CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) cornered in his house. Dwight calls David and tries to talk him into surrendering to the police. David is confused but nonetheless responds in a way that leads Dwight to <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> successful. He emerges from the break room and is greeted by a round of applause from his coworkers.|$|E
5|$|As Galván left a Farmacia Guadalajara {{drugstore}} {{near his}} home in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, on the evening of 27 February 2014, he was kidnapped along with businessman Miguel Ángel Ortiz. His vehicle was discovered abandoned with open doors in the pharmacy's parking lot by his wife. The following day, a disfigured corpse found in the trunk of a pickup truck in the town of García, Nuevo León, was taken to the hospital of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León. After more than a month of forensic examination, experts officially identified the corpse as that of Galván on 31 March 2014. Post-mortem reports concluded that Galván had been tortured before being killed with a coup de grâce. The exact location of Galván's murder remains unknown, although authorities tend to <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> most likely killed in Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|As a captain, Gilligan was well-liked by {{players and}} commentators, {{although}} many did not <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an effective tactician. Nevertheless, under his leadership, Sussex became an attractive, competitive team. He encouraged {{the search for}} young talent, and the players consequently discovered became {{the backbone of the}} club into the 1930s. As a fielder, he inspired his teams to become good fielding sides. In addition, as MCC captain of a team which toured India in 1926–27, he encouraged Indians {{to take responsibility for their}} own cricket board instead of allowing white Englishmen to run Indian cricket, and lobbied the MCC to bestow Test match status on the Indian team. As MCC president, he played a part in the D'Oliveira affair in 1968. He died in 1976, aged 81.|$|E

5|$|Both Robert Bingham and Percy Haly died in 1937; with J. C. W. Beckham aging—he {{would die}} in 1940—Chandler moved {{to fill the}} {{leadership}} void in the faction. He soon came to <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> destined to become President of the United States. In mid-1937, he began advocating for Marvel Mills Logan, Kentucky's junior senator, to be appointed to the Supreme Court, creating a Senate vacancy to which Chandler, as governor, could appoint himself. The death of Justice George Sutherland in January 1938 gave President Franklin D. Roosevelt the opportunity to accommodate Chandler's wishes, but Roosevelt preferred younger justices—Logan was 63—and Kentucky's senior Senator, Alben Barkley, recommended Solicitor General Stanley Forman Reed for the appointment. Roosevelt heeded Barkley's advice and appointed Reed instead of Logan.|$|E
5|$|He {{secretly}} left Louisville {{at night}} and returned to Indianapolis by train. Eitel defended Riley to the press {{in an effort to}} gain sympathy for Riley, explaining the abusive financial arrangements his partners had made. Riley however refused to speak to reporters and hid himself for weeks. Much to Riley's surprise, the news reports made him more popular than ever. Many people thought the stories were exaggerated, and Riley's carefully cultivated image made it difficult for the public to <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an alcoholic. Riley had stopped sending poetry to newspapers and magazines in the aftermath, but they soon began corresponding with him requesting that he resume writing. This encouraged Riley, and he made another attempt to give up liquor as he returned to his public career.|$|E
5|$|Less {{is known}} of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the {{historical}} Stefan Lochner <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We {{know that he was}} commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major city occasion. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40.|$|E

5|$|The conference {{failed to}} produce a settlement, {{breaking}} up {{on the same day}} it began with each side blaming the other for its unsuccessful outcome. Smith believed the nationalists were being unreasonable by requesting preconditions for talks—which they had previously agreed not to do—and asking for diplomatic immunity for their leaders and fighters. The nationalists contended that Smith was being deliberately intransigent and that they did not <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> sincere in seeking an agreement if he was so adamant about not giving diplomatic immunity. Direct talks {{between the government and the}} Zimbabwe African People's Union followed in December 1975, but these also {{failed to produce}} any significant progress. The Victoria Falls Conference, the détente initiative and the associated ceasefire, though unsuccessful, did affect the course of the Rhodesian Bush War, as they gave the nationalist guerrillas significant time to regroup and reorganise themselves following the decisive security force counter-campaign of 1973–74. A further conference would follow in 1976, this time in Geneva.|$|E
