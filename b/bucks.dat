5|$|On the hardwood, {{the veteran}} Robertson still proved {{he was a}} {{valuable}} player. Paired with Abdul-Jabbar, two more division titles with the <b>Bucks</b> followed in the 1971–72 and 1972–73 season. In Robertson's last season, he helped lead Milwaukee to a league-best 59–23 record and helped them to reach the 1974 NBA Finals. There, Robertson {{had the chance to}} end his stellar career with a second ring. The <b>Bucks</b> were matched up against a Boston Celtics team powered by an inspired Dave Cowens, and the <b>Bucks</b> lost in seven games. As a testament to Robertson's importance to the <b>Bucks,</b> in the season following his retirement the <b>Bucks</b> fell to last place in their division with a 38–44 record in spite of the continued presence of Abdul-Jabbar.|$|E

In the draft, the Mavericks drafted Traylor with their sixth pick, and the <b>Bucks</b> selected Nowitzki with their ninth and Garrity with their nineteenth pick. The Mavericks then traded Traylor to the <b>Bucks</b> for Nowitzki and Garrity, and they in return traded the latter to Phoenix for Nash.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970–71 NBA season, the Lakers made {{a notable}} move by signing future Hall-of-Fame guard Gail Goodrich, who {{came back from}} the Phoenix Suns after playing for L.A. until 1968. Chamberlain {{averaged}} 20.7 points, 18.2 rebounds and 4.3 assists, once again led the NBA in rebounding and the Lakers won the Pacific Division title. After losing Elgin Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture that effectively ended his career, and especially after losing Jerry West after a knee injury, the handicapped Lakers were seen as underdogs against the Milwaukee <b>Bucks</b> of freshly crowned MVP Lew Alcindor, and veteran Hall-of-Fame guard Oscar Robertson in the Western Conference Finals. Winning the regular season with 66 wins, the <b>Bucks</b> were seen as favourites against the depleted Lakers; still, many pundits were looking forward to the matchup between the 34-year-old Chamberlain and the 24-year-old Alcindor. In Game 1, Abdul-Jabbar outscored Chamberlain 32–22, and the <b>Bucks</b> won 106–85. In Game 2, the <b>Bucks</b> won again despite the Lakers center scoring 26 points, four more than his Milwaukee counterpart. Prior to Game 3, things became even worse for the Lakers when Keith Erickson, West's stand-in, had an appendectomy and was out for the season; with rookie Jim McMillian easing the scoring pressure, Chamberlain scored 24 points and grabbed 24 rebounds in a 118–107 victory, but the <b>Bucks</b> defeated the Lakers 117–94 in Game 4 to take a 3–1 series lead. Milwaukee closed out the series at home with a 116–98 victory in Game 5. Although Chamberlain lost, he was lauded for holding his own against MVP Alcindor, who was not only 10 years younger, but healthy.|$|E

After a while, all four men began brawling, and André knocked The Mega Powers out of the ring. Subsequently, as part of the scripted ending to the match, Miss Elizabeth began arguing with Ventura, the referee, and ripped off her skirt to reveal her underwear. While the Mega <b>Bucks</b> were distracted, Savage climbed to the top rope and dropped the Macho Elbow on DiBiase, followed by Hogan hitting the leg drop on DiBiase. As Hogan pinned DiBiase, Ventura, a villainous character aligned with The Mega <b>Bucks</b> (despite being a long time on-air Savage fan and his former tag-team partner), began an obviously slow three-count.
