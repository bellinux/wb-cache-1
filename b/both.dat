5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, <b>both</b> {{ships were}} kept in service with the new Turkish Navy, with lengthy {{overhauls}} in the mid-1920s. <b>Both</b> ships were extensively modernized in the late 1930s, and they remained in service to 1944, when they were finally decommissioned. <b>Both</b> vessels were ultimately broken up in the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Although {{casualties}} appeared even on <b>both</b> sides, the Austrians had {{a significantly}} larger fighting force, <b>both</b> on the field at Ostrach, and stretched along a line between Lake Constance and Ulm.

The French withdrew to Engen and Stockach, where {{a few days later}} the armies engaged again, this time with greater losses on <b>both</b> sides, and an Austrian victory.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{campaign}} was decided by a final major action, May 1794 saw <b>both</b> fleets at sea with several subordinate squadrons, <b>both</b> admirals conducting a complicated series of convoy, commerce raiding and fleet manoeuvre operations. Numerous merchant ships and small warships were taken or destroyed during the month-long campaign by <b>both</b> sides and there were also two partial fleet engagements as Howe and Villaret made first contact. <b>Both</b> admirals suffered from wilful disobedience {{by a number of}} their officers during the battle, as well as confusion in reading signals which caused an uneven series of melees to break out rather than the unified battleline Howe had envisaged when planning the action. Nevertheless, <b>both</b> commanders were highly praised on their return to their home ports and the battle was considered a success by <b>both</b> sides, with only a few dissenters amongst the naval establishments of <b>both</b> nations.|$|E

5|$|In early September 1861, <b>both</b> {{federal and}} Confederate troops entered Kentucky.

Instead, the legislature passed a resolution ordering only the Confederate troops out of the state. Magoffin vetoed the resolution, but his veto was overridden, and he obediently issued the order for the Confederates to withdraw. In November 1861, a self-constituted convention of southern sympathizers met at Russellville, Kentucky in order to form a provisional Confederate government for the state.
