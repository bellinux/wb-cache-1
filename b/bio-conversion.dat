40|$|Background: The use {{of fossil}} carbon sources for fuels and {{petrochemicals}} has serious impacts on our environment and {{is unable to}} meet the demand in the future. A promising and sustainable alternative is to substitute fossil carbon sources with microbial cell factories converting lignocellulosic biomass into desirable value added products. However, such bioprocesses require tolerance to inhibitory compounds generated during pretreatment of biomass. In this study, the process of sequential two-step <b>bio-conversion</b> of biomass pyrolysis liquid containing levoglucosan (LG) to citric acid without chemical detoxification has been explored, which can greatly improve the utilization efficiency of lignocellulosic biomass. Results: The sequential two-step <b>bio-conversion</b> of corn stover pyrolysis liquid to citric acid has been established. The first step conversion by Phanerochaete chrysosporium (P. chrysosporium) is desirable to decrease the content of other compounds except levoglucosan as a pretreatment for the second conversion. The remaining levoglucosan in solution was further converted into citric acid by Aspergillus niger (A. niger) CBX- 209. Thus the conversion of cellulose to citric acid is completed by both pyrolysis and <b>bio-conversion</b> technology. Under experimental conditions, levoglucosan yield is 12 % based on the feedstock and the citric acid yield can reach 82. 1 % based on the levoglucosan content in the pyrolysis liquid (namely 82. 1 g of citric acid per 100 g of levoglucosan). Conclusion: The study shows that P. chrysosporium and A. niger have the potential to be used as production platforms for value-added products from pyrolyzed lignocellulosic biomass. Selected P. chrysosporium is able to decrease the content of other compounds except levoglucosan and levoglucosan can be further converted into citric acid in the residual liquids by A. niger. Thus the conversion of cellulose to citric acid is completed by both pyrolysis and <b>bio-conversion</b> technology...|$|E

This biocatalyst has significant advantages in the use of abundant mesophilic enzymes for designing <b>bio-conversion</b> pathways, in addition to thermostable enzymes because the use of psychrophilic hosts allows the heat treatment temperature for inactivation of basic metabolisms to be lower than that of E. coli based simple biocatalysts.

Approach: This study investigated the effects of substrate concentration, initial pH and process temperature on biohydrogen production from surgery wastewater using anaerobic batch reactor. Batch tests are carried out in a 2. 0 L batch reactor under different temperatures of 34, 36, 38 and 40 °C, various initial pH of 4. 5, 5. 5 and 6. 5 and substrate concentrations of 5, 10 and 15 %. The raw seed was compost sludge obtained from municipal wastewater treatment plant in Baghdad (Al-Restomia plant). The volume of evolved gas was measured at room temperature by the water displacement method. Results: The maximum hydrogen production 160 mL L− 1 is obtained at an optimum temperature of 38 °C, optimum pH of 5. 5 and substrate concentration 15 %. Conclusion: The results indicated that the use of compost of Al-Restomia plant as a seed in anaerobic fermentation process has given excellent biogas production under applied conditions...|$|E
40|$|The bio-conversation rate of Daphnia carinata {{fed with}} Chlorella vulgaris grown on digested piggery {{effluent}} at three different feeding rates was determined and a 3, 4 and 5 day (d) harvest interavl strategy was investigated. A significant difference (P = 0. 03) in the feeding rate against mean total populations was found among treatments. The {{increase in the}} amount of algae fed accelerated the production rate, and the population density peaked faster in the high C. vulgaris fed treatment. The <b>bio-conversion</b> rate (BCR) calculated from the experiment indicates that for every 10000 mg of C. vulgaris fed there was an increase of 437. 9 mg of D carinata proudced. A significance difference (P = 0. 017) in biomass production among the different harvest interval treatments was observed. The 3 -d harvest interval produced 4. 68 g of D. carinata followed by 5. 15 g in the 4 -d and 3. 75 g in the 5 -d harvest interval treatment. This study also indicates that 2 stage digested piggery effluent is a suitable culture medium for D. carinata. Andrew Ward, Martin Kumar and David Garma...|$|E
30|$|The {{experimental}} {{evolution is}} typically used {{to investigate the}} adaptation of microbes to specific laboratory conditions (Buckling et al. 2009; Zou et al. 2013). By using this strategy, many strains with potential application in different areas of <b>bio-conversion</b> were obtained (Wu et al. 2014; Harden et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2015). In this study, an experimental evolution for 60  h of fermentation was designed to screen for the LHS. The screening strategy {{was based on the}} inhibition effect of high concentration of l-sorbose to the growth of helper strain. By gradually increasing the concentration of l-sorbose in the fermentation medium, the LHS, with enhanced resistance to high concentration of l-sorbose, could grow well and be finally screened out after a three-step screening procedure. Finally, three strains showing LHS characteristics were obtained. Compared to the original helper strain (control treatment), the screened LHS showed a stronger resistance to high concentration of l-sorbose (Fig.  4). Although it has certain fortuitousness in obtaining LHS by experimental evolution in a short time, it is enough to confirm the hypothesis that the experimental evolution strategy can be used for LHS screening. Combined with other mutagenesis breeding technology, experimental evolution can help us obtain more LHS with higher resistence to L-sorbose and higher companion effects in further study.|$|E
