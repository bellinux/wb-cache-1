40|$|The {{present study}} is the first record of <b>black</b> <b>scorpionfish</b> {{digestive}} tract histology, suggesting that its histological features are mostly {{similar to those of}} other carnivorous fish and congruent to its feeding habits. The digestive systems of five specimens of the <b>black</b> <b>scorpionfish,</b> Scorpaena porcus L., from the eastern Adriatic Sea, were analysed histologically. The paraffin sections of oesophagus, stomach, intestine, liver, gallbladder and pancreas have been stained by hematoxylin – eosin technique in order to distinguish the main histological features of the digestive system in <b>black</b> <b>scorpionfish.</b> The wall of oesophagus and stomach is formed by four distinctive layers: the mucosa, the submucosa, the muscular and the outer layer. The wall of intestine and gallbladder consisted of three distinctive layers: the mucosa, the muscular and the outer layer. The mucosa is the innermost layer, which consists of two different layers: the epithelium and lamina propria. The submucosa is a layer of connective tissue with blood vessels and nerve fibres, and it has not been seen in the intestine and gallblader. In the oesophagus, stomach and intestine, the muscular layer consists of two layers of muscle fibres: circular and longitudinal. In the oesophagus the inner muscular layer consisted of longitudinally arranged striated, while the outer layer consisted of circular muscle fibres. The arrangement of muscular layers in the stomach and intestine is reverse. The muscular layer in the gallbladder is made of a single layer of smooth muscular tissue. The outermost layer of the upper parts of visceral organs is adventitia consisting of connective tissue. In the caudal parts of digestive tract, this layer is replaced by serosa.

Ovaj rad predstavlja prvi zapis o histološkoj građi probavnog sustava škrpuna i ukazuje na sličnost građe probavnog sustava s probavnim sustavom većine mesojednih riba, a u skladu s njegovim prehrambenim navikama. Probavni sustav pet primjeraka škrpuna Scorpaena porcus L., iz istočnog Jadranskog mora je histološki istražen. Parafinski rezovi jednjaka, želuca, crijeva, jetre, gušterače i žučnog mjehura bojeni su hemalaun – eozin tehnikom, kako bi se utvrdila osnovna histološka građa pojedinih dijelova probavnog sustava. U stijenci jednjaka i želuca škrpuna razlikuju se četiri sloja: sluznica, podsluznica, mišićni i vanjski sloj. U stijenci crijeva i žučnog mjehura razlikuju se tri sloja: sluznica,mišićni i vanjski sloj. Sluznica (tunica mucosa) oblaže lumen probavne cijevi i sastoji se od dva različito građena sloja: epitel (lamina epithelialis) i proprija (lamina propria). Lamina muscularis mucosaese ne uočava. Podsluznica (tunica submucosa) je sloj vezivnog tkiva u kojem su uložene veće krvne žile i živčana vlakna, a ne uočava se u stijenci crijeva i žučnog mjehura. Mišićni sloj jednjaka, želuca i crijeva sastoji se od dva sloja: kružnog i uzdužnog. U mišićnom sloju jednjaka unutrašnji sloj izgrađuju uzdužno, a vanjski kružno raspoređena mišićna vlakna, dok je u mišićnom sloju želuca i crijeva raspored mišićnih slojeva obrnut. Vanjski kružni mišićni sloj jednjaka građen je od poprečno – od prugastih mišića, dok je u ostalim dijelovima probavne cijevi mišićni sloj građen od glatkih mišićnih stanica. Mišićni sloj žučnog mjehura građen je od jednog sloja glatkih mišićnih stanica. Vanjski sloj prednjeg dijela probavne cijevi je tunica adventitia građena od vezivnog tkiva. U stražnjem dijelu probavnog sustava vanjski sloj čini tunica serosa ili ovoj peritonealnog mezotela. Jetra se sastoji od hepatocita okruženih mnoštvom masnih stanica. Između hepatocita su smještene sinusoidne kapilare. Gušterača se sastoji od seroznih acinusa...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUnderstanding the {{distribution}} of genetic diversity {{in the light of}} past demographic events linked with climatic shifts will help to forecast evolutionary trajectories of ecosystems within the current context of climate change. In this study, mitochondrial sequences and microsatellite loci were analysed using traditional population genetic approaches together with Bayesian dating and the more recent approximate Bayesian computation scenario testing. The genetic structure and demographic history of a commercial fish, the <b>black</b> <b>scorpionfish,</b> Scorpaena porcus, was investigated throughout the Mediterranean and Black Seas. The results suggest that the species recently underwent population expansions, in both seas, likely concomitant with the warming period following the Last Glacial Maximum, 20 000 years ago. A weak contemporaneous genetic differentiation was identified between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. However, the genetic diversity was similar for populations of the two seas, suggesting a high number of colonizers entered the Black Sea during the interglacial period and/or the presence of a refugial population in the Black Sea during the glacial period. Finally, within seas, an east/west genetic differentiation in the Adriatic seems to prevail, whereas the Black Sea does not show any structured spatial genetic pattern of its population. Overall, these results suggest that the Black Sea is not that isolated from the Mediterranean, and both seas revealed similar evolutionary patterns related to climate change and changes in sea level...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of three scorpionfish species, the <b>black</b> <b>scorpionfish</b> (Scorpaena porcus Linnaeus, 1758), the large-scaled scorpionfish (S. scrofa Linnaeus, 1758) {{and the small}} red scorpionfish (S. notata Rafinesque, 1810) is possible in adults by morphometry, but often problematic in juveniles due to their similar phenotypes. To develop a molecular species identification tool, first, we have analyzed the genetic similarity of the three species by a PCR-based ‘blind method’ that amplified bands from various locations of the genome. We found high levels of nucleotide similarity between S. porcus and S. scrofa, whereas S. notata showed {{a higher level of}} divergence from the other two species. Then, we have searched these patterns for differences between the genomes of Adriatic specimen of these three species and identified several species-specific products in two of them. For the third one a species-specific primer pair amplifying from the 16 S ribosomal DNA was designed. One marker for each species was cloned, sequenced and converted into Sequence Characterized Amplified Region (SCAR) markers amplified by specific primer pairs. The SCAR markers amplified robust bands of limited variability from the target species, while no or only occasional weak products were obtained from the other two, proving that they can be used for molecular {{identification of}} these three species. These markers can help the conservation and future analysis of these three species as well as their possible selection programs for aquaculture purposes...|$|E
40|$|Age {{and growth}} of the <b>black</b> <b>scorpionfish,</b> Scorpaena porcus, were {{estimated}} for different populations inhabiting natural reefs and artificial structures (artificial reefs and offshore gas platforms) in the northwestern Adriatic Sea. Annual growth increment counts were carried out on sagittal otoliths of 415 specimens ranging from 80 to 280 mm TL. The accuracy of age estimates was assessed by testing the annual deposition of annuli {{and the location of}} the first annulus by marginal increment analysis and daily growth increment counts, respectively. As commonly observed in other scorpaenids, annuli consisted of an alternating pattern of opaque and translucent zones. Marginal increment analysis confirmed that annuli are formed once a year, with opaque zones laid down in spring-summer and translucent zones laid down in autumn-winter. The precision of age estimates was tested by applying both the average percent error (APE) and the mean coefficient of variation (CV). The maximum age estimated for the whole sampled populations was 8 years. The von Bertalanffy growth curves were separately fitted for natural and artificial reef populations of S. porcus. The likelihood ratio test indicated that the overall von Bertalanffy growth curves differed significantly between the two populations. The instantaneous growth rate (k, year- 1) and asymptotic length (L∞, cm) were 0. 23 and 22. 30 and 0. 53 and 20. 13 for natural and artificial reef populations, respectively. Compared with natural reef population, populations of S. porcus inhabiting artificial reefs and, particularly, offshore platforms, were characterized by larger and older fish. However, young-of-the-year were completely absent from the platform habitats. The effects of artificial structures on S. porcus populations in the study area are discussed in the light of previous results on scorpionfish living in other areas...|$|E
