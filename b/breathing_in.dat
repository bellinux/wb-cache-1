5|$|Occasionally, {{influenza}} {{can cause}} severe illness including primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia. The obvious symptom is trouble <b>breathing.</b> <b>In</b> addition, {{if a child}} (or presumably an adult) {{seems to be getting}} better and then relapses with a high fever, that is a danger sign since this relapse can be bacterial pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|People with {{infectious}} pneumonia {{often have}} a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of <b>breathing.</b> <b>In</b> the elderly, confusion {{may be the most}} prominent sign.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, {{the band}} {{released}} {{one of their}} most popular, controversial and acclaimed albums, The Number of the Beast. The artwork and title track led to Christian groups in the United States branding the band as Satanists, encouraging people to destroy copies of the release. The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, later commented that Christians initially burnt the records, but later decided to destroy them with hammers through fear of <b>breathing</b> <b>in</b> the melting vinyl's fumes. The protests were not restricted to the US, with Christian organisations preventing Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992.|$|E

50|$|<b>Breathe</b> <b>In.</b> <b>Breathe</b> Out. debuted {{at number}} five on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 39,000 copies {{in its first}} week, marking her fifth top five album on the chart.

However, <b>Breathe</b> <b>In.</b> <b>Breathe</b> Out is also Duff's first studio effort to not receive any certification from RIAA.|$|R
5|$|In {{patients}} of normal intelligence, rumination {{is not an}} intentional behavior and is habitually reversed using diaphragmatic breathing to counter the urge to regurgitate. Alongside reassurance, explanation and habit reversal, patients are shown how to breathe using their diaphragms prior to and during the normal rumination period. A similar breathing pattern {{can be used to}} prevent normal vomiting. <b>Breathing</b> <b>in</b> this method works by physically preventing the abdominal contractions required to expel stomach contents.|$|E
5|$|Killswitch Engage is an American metalcore {{band from}} Westfield, Massachusetts. Their discography {{consists}} of seven studio albums, one video album, and nineteen singles. Formed with 1999, the band signed with Ferret Music, and released their self-titled debut album in 2000. They then signed a recording contract with Roadrunner Records, releasing Alive or Just <b>Breathing</b> <b>in</b> 2002. The album peaked at number 37 on the Heatseekers Albums chart. Their third album, 2004's The End of Heartache, peaked at number 21 on the Billboard 200, and sold 38,000 copies {{in its first}} week of release.|$|E
5|$|Some pugs {{are also}} born with {{stenotic}} nares {{which can also}} inhibit their <b>breathing.</b> <b>In</b> serious cases, the pinched nostrils make breathing even more difficult for this breed and put added pressure on the larynx. In some cases, the dog could pass out from blocked airways. If this happens, one should inquire with their veterinarian whether or not surgery is needed to modify the breathing passages.|$|E

5|$|The local {{symptoms}} of victims bitten by the many-banded krait are usually neither serious swelling nor pain; the victims merely feel slightly itchy and numb. Systemic symptoms occur, in general, one {{to six hours}} after being bitten by this snake. Symptoms may include bilateral ptosis, diplopia, discomfort in the chest, general ache, weak feeling in limbs, ataxia, glossolysis, loss of voice, dysphagia, tunnel vision, and difficulty <b>breathing.</b> <b>In</b> case of serious bite, suppression of breathing may occur, leading to death. Hyponatremia is also seen, but less commonly.|$|E
5|$|Non-human animals may {{experience}} both spontaneous and traumatic pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while traumatic pneumothorax {{is divided into}} open and closed (with or without chest wall damage). The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty <b>breathing</b> <b>in,</b> or has shallow breathing. Pneumothoraces may arise from lung lesions (such as bullae) or from trauma to the chest wall. In horses, traumatic pneumothorax may involve both hemithoraces, as the mediastinum is incomplete {{and there is a}} direct connection between the two halves of the chest. Tension pneumothorax – the presence of which may be suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function, absent lung sounds throughout the thorax, and a barrel-shaped chest – is treated with an incision in the animal's chest to relieve the pressure, followed by insertion of a chest tube.|$|E
5|$|The lungs are {{the primary}} organs of the {{respiratory}} system in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone {{on either side of}} the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles to support and foster <b>breathing.</b> <b>In</b> early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the main muscle of respiration that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.|$|E
