50|$|The <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> is {{actuated}} through hydraulic linkages. This {{consists of a}} hydraulic pressure pump which {{is connected to the}} <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve.</b> This pump controls the operation of <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> in following manner:When brakes are applied by the driver, the cylinder reduces its pressure so that the valve closes and restricts the path of exhaust gases. In this position the <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> remains perpendicular to the flow of exhaust gases and thus creates back pressure on the engine. The <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> has one to three holes in it so {{that there is not a}} complete blockage of the exhaust pipe. This assures the avoidance of damage due to high pressure. When the brakes are released by the driver, the cylinder generates pressure so that <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> is opened and allows the exhaust gases to flow into the exhaust pipe. In this position the <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> remains parallel to the path of exhaust gases and thus releases the pressure on the engine and allows its speed to increase.|$|R

Experimental data for the <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> {{were obtained from the}} Utah Water Research Lab. Simulations were carried out on three-dimensional models of the valve using general-purpose CFD code STAR-CCM+. Results show that for mid-open valve positions (30 - 60 degrees), CFD adequately predicted <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> performance factors. For lower valve-angle cases (10 - 20 degrees), CFD simulations failed to reasonably predict those same values, while higher valve-opening angles (70 - 90 degrees) gave mixed results. However, CFD simulations can provide engineers the ability to understand and predict valve performance, especially when laboratory testing may not be possible...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two experimental investigations for cavitation {{characteristics of}} restriction orifices. The first experiment {{is about the}} spatial distribution of cavitation shock pressure in a pipe at the downstream of restriction orifices. The second experiment is the investigation of <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> throttling to the cavitation in a multiperforated orifice installed piping. From {{the results of the}} experiment for the cavitation shock pressure, it is concluded the maximum shock pressure remarkably increases with the decrease of cavitation number regardless of the orifice types. The maximum shock pressure becomes smallest on cone type orifice, and largest on single hole orifice. Multiperforated orifice is between this two. The results of the experiment for occurrence of cavitation due to the interference of <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> show that the cavitation occurs at a relatively high cavitation number when the multiperforated orifice is placed at 1 D downstream of the <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve.</b> The <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> throttling accelerates the cavitation at the multiperforated orifice because of the closed orifice installation...|$|R

50|$|The 1998 {{redesign}} of the KV6 by Rover Group under BMW included replacing the original metal inlet-manifolds and <b>butterfly</b> <b>valves,</b> with plastic units manufactured in Germany. The redesign also involved replacing the metal thermostat housing {{with a plastic}} unit. A costly but uncommon side-effect to using plastic components are breakages in the VIS (Variable Inlet System) <b>butterfly</b> <b>valves</b> that are mounted inside the non-serviceable inlet manifold. The second common fault is failure of the thermostat housing (often failing along the mould line), {{that will lead to}} gradual but rarely complete loss of coolant. A third common fault is oil contamination in the VIS motors that are mounted {{on the sides of the}} inlet manifold and control air intake. Damage to the <b>butterfly</b> <b>valves</b> or VIS motors is limited to causing a rattling noise in the manifold or minor loss of power at certain engine conditions.|$|E

50|$|V-Boost is {{a system}} that opens <b>butterfly</b> <b>valves</b> in the intake {{manifold}} between the 1st and 2nd and between the 3rd and 4th cylinders starting from 5,750 rpm. The valves are opened gradually to match the rising engine speed with a signal provided by the ignition system. The valves are at the full open position at 8,000 rpm. A small black box sends a computed signal to a servo motor that pulls a wire to open the <b>butterfly</b> <b>valves.</b> The V-Boost system adds 10 percent to the top power rating of the base engine.|$|E

5000|$|To {{control the}} amount of fuel/air mix {{entering}} the engine, a simple <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> (throttle plate) is generally fitted {{at the start of}} the intake manifold (just below the carburetor in carbureted engines).

The <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> often contains a small [...] "idle cutout", a hole that allows small amounts of fuel/air mixture into the engine even when the valve is fully closed, or the carburetor has a separate air bypass with its own idle jet.|$|R
