Integration of data from several such databases into a single repository can aid the discovery of previously unknown connections spanning multiple types of relationships and databases. Results <b>Biomine</b> {{is a system that}} integrates cross-references from several biological databases into a graph model with multiple types of edges, such as protein interactions, gene-disease associations and gene ontology annotations. Edges are weighted based on their type, reliability, and informativeness. We present <b>Biomine</b> and evaluate its performance in link prediction, where the goal is to predict pairs of nodes that will be connected in the future, based on current data. In particular, we formulate protein interaction prediction and disease gene prioritization tasks as instances of link prediction. The predictions are based on a proximity measure computed on the integrated graph. We consider and experiment with several such measures, and perform a parameter optimization procedure where different edge types are weighted to optimize link prediction accuracy. We also propose a novel method for disease-gene prioritization, defined as finding a subset of candidate genes that cluster together in the graph. We experimentally evaluate <b>Biomine</b> by predicting future annotations in the source databases and prioritizing lists of putative disease genes. Conclusions The experimental results show that <b>Biomine</b> has strong potential for predicting links when a set of selected candidate links is available. The predictions obtained using the entire <b>Biomine</b> dataset are shown to clearly outperform ones obtained using any single source of data alone, when different types of links are suitably weighted. In the gene prioritization task, an established reference set of disease-associated genes is useful, but the results show that under favorable conditions, <b>Biomine</b> can also perform well when no such information is available.

50|$|The {{very first}} {{recognized}} <b>biomining</b> system {{was published in}} 1951 when Kenneth Temple Ph.D. discovered that Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans thrives in iron, copper and magnesium rich environments. In Temple's experiment, A. ferrooxidans was was inoculated into media containing between 2,000 and 26,000 ppm ferrous iron. He discovered that the bacteria grew faster and were more motile in high iron concentrations. The byproducts of the bacterial growth caused the media to turn very acidic, in which the microorganisms still thrived. Kenneth Temples experiment proved that microorganisms have mechanisms for sensing and taking up metals {{for use in the}} cell. This discovery lead to the development of complex modern <b>biomining</b> systems. <b>Biomining</b> is the use of microorganisms to leach metals from their growth medium. These systems can be used for bioremediation, biohydrometallurgy, or even extracting metals from ores for commercial use.

50|$|<b>Biomining</b> is a {{technique}} of extracting metals from ores and other solid materials typically using prokaryotes or fungi. These organisms secrete different organic compounds that chelate metals from the environment {{and bring it back}} to the cell where they are typically used to coordinate electrons. It was discovered in the mid 1900's that microorganisms use metals in the cell. Some microbes can use stable metals such as iron, copper, zinc, and gold as well as unstable atoms such as uranium and thorium. Companies can now grow large chemostats of microbes that are leaching metals from their media, these vats of culture can then be transformed into many marketable metal compounds. <b>Biomining</b> is an environmentally friendly technique compared to typical mining. Mining releases many pollutants while the only chemicals released from <b>biomining</b> is any metabolites or gasses that the bacteria secrete. The same concept can be used for bioremediation models. Bacteria can be inoculated into environments contaminated with metals, oils, or other toxic compounds. The bacteria can clean the environment by absorbing these toxic compounds to create energy in the cell. Microbes can achieve things at a chemical level that could never be done by humans. Bacteria can mine for metals, clean oil spills, purify gold, and use radioactive elements for energy.|$|E

This research aimed to identify the impact of space flight on the long-term survival of Cupriavidus metallidurans CH 34 in mineral water and the interaction with basalt, a lunar-type rock in preparation for the ESA spaceflight experiment, BIOROCK. Therefore, C. metallidurans CH 34 cells were suspended in mineral water supplemented with or without crushed basalt and send for 3 months on board the Russian FOTON-M 4 capsule. Long-term storage {{had a significant impact on}} cell physiology and energy status (by flow cytometry analysis, plate count and intracellular ATP measurements) as 60 % of cells stored on ground lost their cell membrane potential, only 17 % were still active, average ATP levels per cell were significantly lower and cultivability dropped to 1 %. The cells stored in the presence of basalt and exposed to space flight conditions during storage however showed less dramatic changes in physiology, with only 16 % of the cells lost their cell membrane potential and 24 % were still active, leading to a higher cultivability (50 %) and indicating a general positive effect of basalt and space flight on survival. Microbe-mineral interactions and biofilm formation was altered by spaceflight as less biofilm was formed on the basalt during flight conditions. Leaching from basalt also changed (measured with ICP-OES), showing that cells release more copper from basalt and the presence of cells also impacted iron and magnesium concentration irrespective of the presence of basalt.

50|$|Bioleaching is {{a mining}} {{technique}} in which metals are extracted from their insoluble ores {{through the use}} of living organisms by biological oxidation. This technique has progressed steadily in the past 20 years by taking advantage of bacteria such as A. thiooxidans. <b>Biomining</b> operations have enabled the solubilization of low-grade mineral ores. Compared to traditional smelting and extracting procedures, bioleaching is much less expensive and does not release as many environmental toxicants, but it does require a greater amount of time. Bioleaching involves at least three important subprocesses, viz., attack of the sulfide mineral, microbial oxidation of ferrous iron, and some sulfur moiety. The overall process occurs via one of two pathways depending {{on the nature of the}} sulfide mineral, a pathway via thiosulfate resulting in sulfate being formed or a polythionate pathway resulting in the formation of elemental sulfur.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Biomining</b> {{refers to}} both biooxidation, where the sulfide mineral {{surrounding}} the desired metal is oxidized {{to expose the}} metal of interest, and bioleaching, where the sulfide mineral is solubilized to obtain the metal of interest. Due to the exothermic nature of bioleaching, the thermophilic nature of A. caldus allows for less cooling and quicker rates of bioleaching overall. Bacteria belonging to the genus Acidithiobacillus possess the ability to oxidize sulfidic ores and thereby solubilize metals. This ability has contributed to a general public interest in this microorganism because of its application in the industrial bioleaching of metals from ores and because of its effective means by which to recover precious metals. Bacteria involved in bioleaching function primarily to produce Fe3+ from the oxidation of ferrous iron, which is then used to carry out sulfur oxidization, which provides an essential energy source for important cellular metabolic functions ...|$|E
50|$|Acidithiobacillus caldus {{formerly}} {{belonged to}} the genus Thiobacillus prior to 2000, when it was reclassified along {{with a number of}} other bacterial species into one of three new genera that better categorize sulfur-oxidizing acidophiles.

Considered {{to be one of the}} most common microbes involved in <b>biomining,</b> it is capable of oxidizing reduced inorganic sulfur compounds (RISCs) that form during the breakdown of sulfide minerals. The meaning of the prefix acidi- in the name Acidithiobacillus comes from the Latin word acidus, signifying that members of this genus love a sour, acidic environment. Thio is derived from the Greek word thios and describes the use of sulfur as an energy source, and bacillus describes the shape of these microorganisms, which are small rods.

NMP 2 -CT- 2005 - 500329). It {{is dedicated to the}} evaluation of biohydrometallurgy to improve the exploitation of the European non-ferrous metal resources in a sustainable way. At the end of 2007, the Consortium of <b>BioMinE</b> comprised 37 partners from industry (13 including 6 Small or Medium Enterprises), research organisations (8), universities (15), and government (1). The participants are from 13 EU member states and from Serbia and South Africa (INCO Countries). For more details see [URL] The three main kinds of resources considered for bioleaching studies are: * - Copper polymetallics (concentrates and tailings), * - Zinc polymetallics (zinc and zinc polymetallic concentrates) * - Secondary wastes (tailings, rock and metallurgical wastes, etc.) For each of these resources, amenability studies of application of bioleaching technologies by various approaches have been undertaken or still ongoing. Further processing assessment will be conducted up to the demonstration scale. Technological improvements have been made to apply bioleaching {{in the context of the}} European resources in terms of complexity and sustainability requirements. The relevant fundamental studies covering bio-prospecting, molecular ecology, biochemistry, and genetics areas aimed at improving the understanding and the control of the selected technologies have given original results. Much progress has also been obtained in the use of the microbial sulfate-reducing process to polish effluents and to recover metals from leachates containing low concentrations of metals. The finding of micro-organisms thriving at low and high temperature, respectively 8 and 65 °C, leads to an extension of the application range of the process. It has been also observed that this process could be pushed down to pH 4. 5 and 4 creating opportunities of selective metal recovery as metal sulphides. It has also been demonstrated that sulphate can be removed at high concentrations, as well as arsenic or selenium. The next step in this work is pilot testing. This will allow to determine scale-up criteria and to assess the residual metal concentration under actual conditions. The pilot-scale demonstration operations, as well as the techno-economic and comparative sustainability assessments will be achieved during 2008, the last year of the project.
