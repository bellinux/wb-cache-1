50|$|In 1993, Bess Rich {{was elected}} to the city council in District 6; Dow won {{re-election}} that year with more than 65% of the vote. Rich frequently questioned Dow's agenda of capital spending without a sustainable revenue source. Most of the city council supported him. When the Mobile BayBears team approached the city, Rich opposed the borrowing for construction of the stadium because she believed in allowing the public to vote on non-basic service capital projects. She also opposed the attention Dow gave to capital projects downtown, because of the increased debt load from borrowing it placed on the community with no thought to paying back the debt or obtaining funds to support maintenance of the projects.

This rediscovery of Kondratiev in English-speaking academia led to his theories being extended {{for the first time}} beyond economics as, for example, political scientists such as Joshua Goldstein and geographers such as Brian Berry extended the concept of Kondratiev long waves into their own fields. However, Kondratiev's theory remains controversial because, among other issues, of his ideas about the periodical character of the replacement of <b>basic</b> <b>capital</b> goods and the empirical possibility of coincidence in identifying long waves (i.e. that long waves are simply an epiphenomenon).|$|E

The <b>basic</b> <b>capital</b> {{was not to be}} touched, while the fund's interests should be used for a prize given to a sportsperson who, during the last two years, had excelled in one sport and also showed eminent performances in another, completely different sport. The prize is a bronze statuette modelled by sculptor Magnus Vigrestad, who won the design competition. The prize was regarded the highest achievement in Norwegian sport at the time. The statutes have changed slightly over the years. Today the prize is awarded by the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports, and given to Norwegian sports people who have excelled nationally in at least two sports, and excelled internationally in at least one of these. The first awardee was skier and football player Gunnar Andersen, who received the prize for 1918. The first female recipient was Laila Schou Nilsen, who received the prize for 1936 for her achievements in skiing, speed-skating and tennis. In 1983 Cato Zahl Pedersen received the prize (for 1981) for disabled sports.|$|E

40|$|In {{legal theory}} of company law “basic capital” has been {{perceived}} as a necessary capital for doing business (starting business). This type of concept still exists in national {{as well as in}} international legislation. According to the legal theory, the basic function of this concept is to ensure creditors in charging their claims from company/debtor. Against this, in last few decades, the business sector has imposed the idea of inopportuneness of <b>basic</b> <b>capital</b> for protection/security of creditor’s rights/claims against debtors. This concept of inopportuneness of “basic capital” for protection/security of creditor’s rights gradually expanded into more segments of business sector, not excluding theory. In fact, business sector assumes that “basic capital” is a mislaid concept. Among entrepreneurs (business environment), <b>basic</b> <b>capital</b> is not {{perceived as a}}n instrument that guarantees the payment of creditor's claims.
