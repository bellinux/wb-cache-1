Rock and roll pioneer Wynonie Harris, jazz great Preston Love, drummer Buddy Miles, and Luigi Waites are among the city's homegrown talent. Doug Ingle from the late 1960s <b>band</b> <b>Iron</b> Butterfly was born in Omaha, as was indie folk singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, though both were raised elsewhere.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Banded</b> <b>iron</b> {{formations}} (BIFs) are {{sedimentary rocks}} containing more than 15% iron composed predominantly of thinly bedded iron minerals and silica (as quartz). <b>Banded</b> <b>iron</b> formations occur exclusively in Precambrian rocks, and are commonly weakly to intensely metamorphosed. <b>Banded</b> <b>iron</b> formations may contain iron in carbonates (siderite or ankerite) or silicates (minnesotaite, greenalite, or grunerite), {{but in those}} mined as iron ores, oxides (magnetite or hematite) are the principal <b>iron</b> mineral. [...] <b>Banded</b> <b>iron</b> formations are known as taconite within North America.|$|R
40|$|<b>Banded</b> <b>iron</b> {{formations}} {{have been}} studied for decades, particularly regard-ing their potential as archives of the Precambrian environment. In spite of this effort, the mechanism of their deposition and, specifically, the role that microbes played in the precipitation of <b>banded</b> <b>iron</b> formation minerals, remains unresolved. Evidence of an anoxic Earth with only localized oxic areas until the Great Oxidation Event ca 245 to 232 Ga makes the investi-gation of O 2 -independent mechanisms for <b>banded</b> <b>iron</b> formation deposition relevant. Recent studies have explored the long-standing proposition that Archean <b>banded</b> <b>iron</b> formations may have been formed, and diagenetically modified, by anaerobic microbial metabolisms. These efforts encompass {{a wide array of}} approaches including isotope, ecophysiological and phylog-eny studies, molecular and mineral marker analysis, and sedimentological reconstructions. Herein, the current theories of microbial processes in <b>banded</b> <b>iron</b> formation mineral deposition with particular regard to the mechanisms of chemical sedimentation and post-depositional alteration are described. The main findings of recent years are summarized and compared here, and suggestions are made regarding cross-disciplinary information still required to constrain the role of the biosphere in <b>banded</b> <b>iron</b> forma-tion deposition...|$|R

Murphy also praised the additional material featured on the release, finding that the new content was [...] "where a great album gets even better". Steve Harris, the bass player for the heavy metal <b>band</b> <b>Iron</b> Maiden, has called Aqualung [...] "a classic album", lauding its [...] "fantastic playing, fantastic songs, attitude [...] vibe". Iron Maiden would go on to cover [...] "Cross-Eyed Mary" [...] as the B-side of their 1983 single [...] "The Trooper".|$|E

40|$|Debates on the {{formation}} of <b>banded</b> <b>iron</b> formations in ancient ferruginous oceans are dominated by a dichotomy between abiotic and biotic iron cycling. This is fuelled by difficulties in unravelling the exact processes involved in their formation. Here we provide fossil environmental evidence for anoxygenic photoferrotrophic deposition of analogue <b>banded</b> <b>iron</b> rocks in shallow marine waters associated with an Early Quaternary hydrothermal vent field on Milos Island, Greece. Trace metal, major and rare earth elemental compositions suggest that the deposited rocks closely resemble <b>banded</b> <b>iron</b> formations of Precambrian origin. Well-preserved microbial fossils in combination with chemical data imply that band formation was linked to periodic massive encrustation of anoxygenic phototrophic biofilms by iron oxyhydroxide alternating with abiotic silica precipitation. The data implicate cyclic anoxygenic photoferrotrophy and their fossilization mechanisms {{in the construction of}} microskeletal fabrics that result in {{the formation}} of characteristic <b>banded</b> <b>iron</b> formation <b>bands</b> of varying silica and iron oxide ratios...|$|R
