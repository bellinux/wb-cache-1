Discussing Charlie's motives, Anderson stated: [...] "Ruby's at that age where she is quite impressionable, and Charlie doesn't {{want to see her}} getting hurt. She's only very recently been in a relationship with Romeo, and Charlie is concerned about her moving from one guy to the next too quickly." [...] Casey's brother Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke) tries to advise Ruby through her troubles. Although she was not prepared to listen, Darryl gave her a new understanding, a development that is said to [...] "surprise" [...] Ruby. Questioned about Ruby's situation Anderson opined: [...] "He offers the first <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> advice that she's heard in relation to parenting so, as much as she doesn't want to admit it, he does get through." ...|$|E
500|$|This was a {{stressful}} time for Australian soldiers deployed to these checkpoints. The South Africans {{were determined to}} intimidate the UN forces, and SWAPO casualties occurred {{in the immediate vicinity}} of several checkpoints. The South Africans set up in force immediately adjacent to many checkpoints, pointed machine guns at the Australians and demanded that they hand over SWAPO soldiers who had surrendered. The Australian and British soldiers were outnumbered and out-gunned. Despite the fact that only nine SWAPO appeared at the points, the operation was a political success. Lieutenant Colonel Neil Donaldson, commander of the British contingent, said that [...] "the world press showed Australian and British soldiers standing up to a bunch of South African bullies". Crocker said that the fact that the Australian soldiers completed this operation without any casualties was a tribute to the [...] "training standards of the Australian Army and perhaps, a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> luck". The conclusion of Operation Piddock meant that the Australians were able to begin their engineering tasks.|$|E

As Hill {{moved to}} the podium, a {{reporter}} friend passed Bryan a note urging {{him to make a}} patriotic speech without hint of sectionalism; Bryan responded, [...] "You will not be disappointed." [...] Hill gave a calm speech defending the gold position, and swayed few delegates. He was followed by two other gold men, Senator William Vilas of Wisconsin and former Massachusetts Governor William E. Russell. Vilas gave a lengthy defense of the Cleveland administration's policies, so long that Russell, fearing that Vilas' speech would cut into his time, asked that the time given to the gold proponents be extended by ten minutes. Bryan consented, on condition that his own time was extended by the same amount; this was agreed to. [...] "And I needed it for the speech I was to make."

[...] After it no longer mattered, the Cardinals won 9 of their last 11 games to finish 86-76.

2500|$|During {{the first}} rotation, the {{squadron}} {{was involved in}} a wide variety of tasks. The first task was to lead [...] "Operation Safe Passage". This required the squadron members (supported by British signallers) to work as infantry and man border and internal assembly points. At the time these were the only military units that could be re-deployed quickly to northern Namibia. The aim of the operation was to facilitate the withdrawal of the South-West Africa People's Organisation's (SWAPO) military wing, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) combatants. A total of nine assembly points were established with 10 soldiers and five military observers at each. Agreement was subsequently reached in late April that the SADF personnel be restricted to their bases from 26 April; and in effect from this date hostilities largely ceased. Over this period of about three weeks it has been estimated that 251 PLAN combatants were killed for the loss of 21 members of the SADF and other Security Forces. The fact that the Australian soldiers survived this operation without casualty was said to be a tribute to the 'training standards of the Australian Army and perhaps, a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> luck'.|$|E

It follows that, for a common class of iterative receivers where the error correcting decoder must operate at first iteration at rate above capacity (such as in turbo equalization, iterative channel estimation, parallel and serial concatenated coding and the like), classical good codes which achieve capacity over the Additive White Gaussian Noise Channel are not effective and should be replaced by different new ones.

Her recent article [...] "Stop Excluding Actors With Disabilities" [...] was posted to the front page of Backstage. In it, Handler points out that there are many disabled characters written in movies, television and theater but that in most cases, an able bodied actor is chosen to portray them. She feels that this is an extreme oversight: Professionally trained actors with disabilities are creating opportunities by writing, directing, and producing plays and films, but we need more allies in the entertainment industry. Society sees something new and instantly becomes curious or afraid, loves it or hates it. Actors with disabilities are still “new” to diversity because we are rarely seen in the entertainment industry. Inclusion can help society overcome its preconceptions of disability, instead of advancing stereotypes. Let’s all consciously choose to love and be curious about actors with disabilities.We’re ready, willing, and entirely able to step, hop, and wheel into the spotlight.
