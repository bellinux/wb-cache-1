500|$|After {{an almost}} four-month delay, Oblivion went gold on March 2, 2006 and was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on March 21, 2006. Early rumors notwithstanding, Oblivion shipped on a single DVD-DL disc. One journalist voiced concern for the game's release date, as it was set in the same week as that of EA's [...] Hines dismissed the suggestion, saying, [...] "We {{tend to focus on}} what we can control and not worry about what we can't control. Given the level of interest and the number of pre-orders and so forth, we had a pretty good idea we'd <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>fine</b> no matter what else was happening that week." [...] Oblivion was the first RPG title to be released for Microsoft's Xbox 360 console. In addition to the standard release version, a Collector's Edition was released for both Windows and Xbox 360 which includes the 112-page Pocket Guide to the Empire, a bonus DVD containing concept art, renders, and an approximately 45-minute-long documentary on the making of Oblivion, and a coin replica of the in-game currency of Tamriel. Its suggested release price of US$69.99 brought back [...] "memories of game prices circa the Nintendo 64" [...] for one Kotaku commentator. Some suggested that the included coin be used to create a [...] "garish piece of jewelry".|$|E

[...] He appealed {{for the end of the}} two economies, [...] "one for people who are set for life, they know their kids and grandkids are going to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>fine,</b> and then one for most Americans, people who live paycheck to paycheck." [...] Edwards also stated how the Democrats expected to pay for their agenda: [...] "We're going to roll back – we're going to roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.

Days after being criticized for his comments following the Charlottesville rally, Trump {{announced that he would}} be holding a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona. [...] The Mayor of Phoenix, Greg Stanton, repeatedly called for the rally to be postponed in light of Charlottesville, and stated that Trump should apologize having [...] "inflamed racial tension across the country {{as a result of this}} failure of moral leadership." [...] Stanton specifically urged that Arpaio not be granted a pardon and stated that an announcement at the rally would make it [...] "clear that [...] true intent is to inflame emotions and further divide our nation." [...] During the rally, Trump asked rhetorically whether [...] "Sheriff Joe [...] convicted for doing his job" [...] and declared that Arpaio [...] "should have had a jury"; these comments were greeted with strong approval by the attendees. [...] The rally's tone was described as [...] "angry" [...] (NPR's Domenico Montanaro described it as [...] "incendiary," [...] stating that Trump had [...] "ripped at cultural divides [...] played to white grievance"), but he stopped short of issuing the pardon; Trump made his intention clear, however, stating that [...] "I'll make a prediction.
