25|$|The osprey {{is notable}} {{as the best}} example of the predator-prey {{relationship}} within the Mount Henry Peninsula region. It is an ecological specialist (it depends on particular types of diet or habitat). The osprey's main diet is fish, and its opposable back claws let it grasp fish as it dives.

The osprey feeds on nearly any fish which it can digest - fish species identified in the Mount Henry-Canning River area are <b>black</b> <b>bream,</b> Swan River goby and Perth herring.|$|E

40|$|The {{respiratory}} {{responses and}} tolerance of hypoxia were studied in two marine teleosts, the red grouper (Epinephelus akaara, a sluggish species) and the <b>black</b> sea <b>bream</b> (Mylio macrocephalus, an active species). Neither species showed abnormal behaviour or mortality {{when exposed to}} 2 mg O 2 l- 1 for 7 h. The <b>black</b> sea <b>bream</b> was, however, comparatively more tolerant when exposed to 1 mg O 2 l- 1, but tolerance of both species became similar under extremely hypoxic conditions (i. e. 0. 5 mg O 2 l- 1). In contrast to most other teleosts, both species showed a reduction in opercular beating rate during hypoxia, and oxygen conformity {{was found in the}} range of 0. 5 to 7. 0 mg O 2 l - 1. O 2 dissociation curves were constructed, and the P 50 value of the <b>black</b> sea <b>breams</b> (27 ± 5. 6 mm Hg) was found to be much lower than that of the red groupers (50 ± 2. 5 mm Hg). For both species, the general levels of venous PO 2 showed a direct relationship to ambient PO 2, and were markedly reduced after 1 h exposure to various levels of hypoxia. Compared with the red groupers, the <b>black</b> sea <b>breams</b> appeared to be more able to maintain its venous PO 2 levels during prolonged hypoxic exposure. © 1984 Dr W.

40|$|Red {{groupers}} (Epinephelus akaara Temminck & Schlegel) and <b>black</b> sea <b>breams</b> (Mylio macrocephalus Basilewsky) {{were transferred}} from 30 ‰ into 3, 7, 12, 20, and 30 ‰ salinity. Fish were sampled at 0, 6, 24, 96, 168 and 336 h after transfer. Serum osmolality, glucose, protein, Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, liver glycogen, liver protein, muscle water and haematocrit were determined. In general, transient disturbances in these variables were observed after transfer. For both species, no tissue hydration was observed upon acclimation to different salinities, whereas a progressive increase in haematocrit value was found as salinity decreased. Liver glycogen of both species, however, was higher in hypo-osmotic salinities. Serum Na+ {{of the red}} groupers declined upon acclimation to 7 ‰ salinity but the opposite was found for the <b>black</b> sea <b>breams.</b> The results indicate that both species are extremely euryhaline, and physiological stress is unlikely to occur within the salinity regime of 7 to 30 ‰ Comparatively, the <b>black</b> sea <b>bream</b> {{appears to be a}} more efficient osmoregulator. © 1982. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Finally, the {{isolation}} and cloning of <b>black</b> sea <b>bream</b> SL receptor using PCR cloning and protein pull down assay were also attempted. Based on the PCR cloning results, the phylogenetic analysis of nonsalmonids fish GHR 1 and SLR protein sequence, the GHR 1 data of tissue distribution {{and effects of}} environmental salinity and fasting in tilapia, along {{with the results of}} far western blot, <b>black</b> sea <b>bream</b> GHR 1 is probably a receptor for SL, however there is also a SL specific receptor in <b>black</b> sea <b>bream.</b> In hormone treated primary cell culture of nonspawning <b>black</b> sea <b>bream</b> pituitary, 10 - 8 M E 2 significantly increases SL mRNA level but 10 - 10 M, 10 - 9 M, 10 - 8 M of E 2 inhibit GH mRNA level in female black seabream; 10 - 8 M E 2 also inhibits SL and GH mRNA expression in bisexual black sea bream; 10 - 8 M MT inhibits SL mRNA expression in male <b>black</b> sea <b>bream</b> but any concentration of MT detected shows no significant effect on GH mRNA level. Key words. somatolactin (SL), monthly changes, SL promoter, pit- 1 and SL receptorSomatolactin, SL, is a novel member of GH family of pituitary hormone only found in fish. It {{is considered to be a}} member of the GH gene family after gene duplication. Two types of SL, SL alpha and SL beta were identified, and SL 13 seems only in fresh water fish, such as goldfish, catfish, rainbow trout, eel and zebrafish. <b>Black</b> sea <b>bream</b> is a marine fish, and there is only SL alpha found from sequencing of over 100 SL cDNA clones. The cDNAs encoding for transcription factor pit- 1 variants were cloned and the transactivation of these Pit- 1 isoforms on SL gene promoter were studied. Three variants of Pit- 1 are first identified in fish. Pit- 1 b and Pit- 1 c can enhance SL promoter activity in Hepa-T 1 cells respectively to about 2 fold and 12 fold, but pit- 1 a failed to activate the SL gene it in the same cells. All the three pit- 1 s of <b>black</b> sea <b>bream</b> couldn't reverse the inhibition of SL promoter in GH 3 cells. The data suggest that N terminal 60 amino acid residues are critical in transactiation on SL promoter and SL promoter activity is possibly limited to fish SL secreting cells. The SL gene promoter was obtained for gene regulation studies aiming to search for possible regulatory elements controlling the transcription of SL gene in black seabream. SL gene promoter is active in HepaT 1 cells, but is inhibited in GH 3 cells. Seven putative pit- 1 response elements were confirmed with EMSA and super shift assay. To study the physiological function of SL in black seabream, we initiated a study of monthly expressions of SL mRNA and gonadal somatic index (GSI) to determine whether SL is related to reproduction in black seabream, with GH mRNA levels were also detected for comparison. The results imply that function of SL is possibly related to early development of testis, while GH probably plays some roles in testis and ovary maturation. by Tian, Jing. "October 2007.

No developmenta 1 stages of C. Iatigenitalis haye been described thus far. The chalimus larvae of this species could be identified to stage, and the stages conf:irmed, by the basal structure of the frontal filament and the body length as compared to some congeners. The following points are discussed: quanthative variation of armature elements of the legs among congeneric copepodids, growth increments in the successive chalimus stages, {{the two types of}} frontal filament recognized among congeneric chalimus larvae, and the problematic, so-called preadult stage.

40|$|We first {{examined}} the uptake kinetics of Cd and Zn {{in the juvenile}} marine <b>black</b> sea <b>bream</b> (Acanthopagrus schlegeli) {{over a wide range}} of ambient Cd and Zn concentrations, and the relationships with metal accumulation (uptake rate and amount of nonexchangeable surface binding) were established for different fish tissues. Both Cd and Zn accumulation in the body increased linearly with exposure time after the initial metal surface binding. The dissolved Cd and Zn uptake rate constants were 2. 64 and 6. 50 L/kg/d, respectively, and the kinetics followed a first-order process. No evidence of biphasic transport was found, in contrast to the situation in freshwater fish. Viscera were the most important sites of metal uptake, and gills were the second most important sites. The <b>black</b> sea <b>breams</b> were then acclimated at different Cd or Zn concentrations from either waterborne or dietary source for one week, and the alteration of metal uptake kinetics or subcellular distribution and metallothionein (MT) induction were further quantified. The Cd body burden was enhanced up to 8. 6 - and 49 -fold after waterborne and dietary Cd pre-exposure, respectively. Cadmium pre-exposure also altered the tissue-specific subcellular Cd distribution and significantly elevated tissue MT levels. In contrast, the <b>black</b> sea <b>breams</b> were able to regulate Zn accumulation, and waterborne or dietary Zn pre-exposure had only weak influences on Zn body burden and redistribution. Both Cd and Zn pre-exposures enhanced the metal uptake rate constants, whereas the nonexchangeable surface bindings were less impacted by these pre-exposures. We demonstrated a positive relationship between the Cd uptake rate and Cd or MT concentration in the fish. Pre-exposure to metals may substantially modify the kinetics of metal uptake...|$|R
