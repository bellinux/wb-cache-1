5000|$|Amphibious {{aircraft}} {{were particularly}} {{useful in the}} unforgiving terrain of Alaska and northern Canada, where many remain in civilian service, providing remote communities with vital links to the outside world. The Canadian Vickers Vedette was developed for forestry patrol in remote areas, previously a job that was done by canoe and took weeks could be accomplished in hours, revolutionizing forestry conservation. Although successful, flying <b>boat</b> <b>amphibians</b> like it ultimately proved less versatile than floatplane amphibians and are no longer as common as they once were. Amphibious floats that could be attached to any aircraft were developed, turning any aircraft into an amphibian, and these continue to be essential for getting into the more remote locations {{during the summer months}} when the only open areas are the waterways.Despite the gains of amphibious floats, small flying <b>boat</b> <b>amphibians</b> continued to be developed into the 1960s, with the Republic Seabee and Lake LA-4 series proving popular, though neither was a commercial success due to factors beyond their makers control. Many today are homebuilts, by necessity as the demand is too small to justify the costs of development, with the Volmer Sportsman being a popular choice amongst the many offerings.|$|R

50|$|The famous American flier, Colonel Charles Lindbergh, {{arrived in}} the Demerara River with his flying <b>boat</b> (an <b>amphibian</b> craft) on September 22, 1929. The first regular flights to the {{interior}} started in 1939.|$|R
5000|$|In 1926, Chalk's International Airlines {{built an}} air {{terminal}} on a landfill island, Watson Island, where {{it continued to}} operate for over 75 years. Its scheduled and other flights by flying <b>boats</b> and <b>amphibian</b> aircraft served many points in the Bahamas and other nearby destinations.|$|R
5000|$|The S-34 was a {{sesquiplane}} <b>amphibian</b> with a <b>boat</b> hull, being {{powered by}} two tractor [...] Wright Whirlwind J-4 engines. It had a boom-mounted twin-rudder tail unit and room inside the hull for five passengers. During a test flight in November 1927 one engine failed and the S-34 crashed and sank. Igor Sikorksy {{and the others}} onboard escaped without injury but the S-34 was destroyed. It was the first Sikorsky aircraft with a boat hull and {{would lead to a}} family of similar flying <b>boats</b> and <b>amphibians.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Flywhale, built {{mainly from}} {{composite}} materials, is a flying <b>boat</b> style <b>amphibian,</b> {{with a single}} step hull and sponsons rather than wing tip floats. It accommodates two in side-by-side seating fitted with dual control. The design also provides room for two people {{to sleep in the}} fuselage. A large, one-piece canopy hinges forward for access and there are separate, removable side windows. Behind the seats is a baggage area. The Flywhale has short-legged, tricycle landing gear with mainwheels retracting backwards into the sponsons. It can operate on land, water and snow-civered surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, in Guernsey, {{things were}} at a less {{advanced}} stage, and most air services were those by flying <b>boats</b> and <b>amphibians.</b> Guernsey Airways was very much smaller than its sister company in Jersey. Two Saro flying boats were used: Windhover (G-ABJP) and Saro Cloud (G-ABXW), named [...] "Cloud of Iona". In May 1939, Guernsey's new airport was opened. On 8 May 1939, Guernsey Airways began a service to Southampton, using a DH.86A (G-ADVK) and a DH.86B (G-AENR), later joined by a DH.95 Flamingo (G-AFUF). In June 1939, the prototype Flamingo (G-AFUE) was evaluated by Jersey Airways, but further orders for the type were frustrated by world events.|$|R

2500|$|In January 1930, Whittle was {{promoted}} to Flying Officer. In Coventry, on 24 May 1930, Whittle married his fiancée, Dorothy Mary Lee, with whom he later had two sons, David and Ian. Then, in 1931, he was posted to the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment at Felixstowe as an armament officer and test pilot of seaplanes, where he continued to publicize his idea. [...] This posting {{came as a surprise}} for he had never previously flown a seaplane, but he nevertheless increased his reputation as a pilot by flying some 20 different types of floatplanes, flying <b>boats,</b> and <b>amphibians.</b> Every officer with a permanent commission was expected to take a specialist course, and as a result Whittle attended the Officers’ Engineering Course at RAF Henlow, Bedfordshire in 1932. He obtained an aggregate of 98% in all subjects in his exams, completing the course in 18months instead of the more normal twoyears.|$|R
5000|$|With {{a factory}} {{already in place}} in Port Washington, on Long Island, the AAC {{sponsored}} {{the construction of a}} seaplane base in the town. It was officially dedicated by the striking of a bronze medal on 14 September 1929.

Prominent speakers at the dedication included Edward P. Warner.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{traditionally}} a maritime nation, a {{large number}} of amphibians were built between the wars, starting from 1918 with the Vickers Viking and the early 1920s Supermarine Seagull and were used for exploration and military duties including search and rescue, artillery spotting and anti-submarine patrol. The most notable being the Short Sunderland which carried out many anti-submarine patrols over the North Atlantic on sorties of 8 - 12 hours duration. These evolved throughout the interwar period to ultimately culminate in the post World War 2 Supermarine Seagull, which was to have replaced the wartime Walrus and the Sea Otter but was overtaken by advances in helicopters. Starting in the mid-1920s and running into the late 1930s in the United States, Sikorsky produced an extensive family of amphibians (the S-34, S-36, S-38, S-39, S-41, S-43) that were widely used for exploration and as airliners around the globe, helping pioneer many overseas air routes where the larger flying boats could not go, and helping to popularize amphibians in the US.The Grumman Corporation, late-comers to the game, introduced a pair of light utility amphibious aircraft - the Goose and the Widgeon during the late 1930s for the civilian market. However, their military potential could not be ignored, and many were ordered by the US Armed forces and their allies during World War II. Not coincidentally, the Consolidated Catalina (named for Santa Catalina Island off the coast of southern California whose resort was partially popularized by the use of amphibians in the 1930s, including Sikorskys, and Douglas Dolphins) was redeveloped from being a pure flying <b>boat</b> into an <b>amphibian</b> during the war. After the war, the United States military ordered hundreds of the Grumman Albatross and its variants for a variety of roles, though, like the pure flying boat was made obsolete by helicopters which could operate in sea conditions far beyond what the best seaplane could manage.Development of amphibians was not limited to the United Kingdom and the United States but few designs saw more than limited service - there being a widespread preference for pure flying boats and floatplanes due to the weight penalty the undercarriage imposed, yet Russia also developed a number of important flying boats, including the widely used pre-war Shavrov Sh-2 utility flying boat, and postwar the Beriev Be-12 anti-submarine and maritime patrol amphibian. Development of amphibians continues in Russia with the jet engined Beriev Be-200. Italy, bordering the Mediterranean and Adriatic has had a long history of waterborne aircraft going back to the first Italian aircraft to fly. While most were not amphibians, quite a few were, including the Savoia-Marchetti S.56A and the Piaggio P.136.|$|R
