25|$|Both {{the motive}} for killing Alfred, and the method of his murder, were changed - Alfred had spotted Quimper {{planting}} a false clue {{on the grounds of}} the Hall, knowing that the body of his wife would be found eventually. When Alexander and James find it and show it to the family, Alfred suspected Quimper was up to something and decided to blackmail him, boasting to Lucy just before dinner that he was due to receive money. When the family fall ill at dinner by a small dose of arsenic, Alfred, weakened as a result, is later killed in his bed by a fatal injection from Quimper; as he is being killed, Alfred cried out his killer's name, which Quimper made certain was misconstrued as him calling for the doctor's help, shortly after appearing to have run <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> to Alfred's bedroom when Emma rushed out to the commotion being created.|$|E
25|$|After Ryan {{was sentenced}} to Pentridge Prison, he was placed in B Division where he met fellow {{prisoner}} Peter John Walker (who was serving a 12-year sentence for bank robbery). When Ryan was informed {{that his wife was}} seeking a divorce, he made a plan to escape from prison. Walker decided to go along with him. Ryan planned to take himself and his family and flee to Brazil, which did not have an extradition treaty with Australia. At around 2:07pm on Sunday, 19 December 1965, Ryan and Walker put the escape plan into effect. As prison officers were taking turns attending a staff Christmas party in the officers' mess hall, Ryan and Walker scaled a five-metre prison wall with the aid of two wooden benches, a hook and blankets. Running {{along the top of the}} wall to a prison watch tower, they overpowered prison warder Helmut Lange and took his M1 carbine rifle. Ryan threatened Lange and demanded he pull the lever to open the prison tower gate. Lange, however, deliberately pulled the wrong lever. Ryan, Walker and Lange then proceeded down the steps to the tower gate, but it would not open. At the bottom of the stairs was the night officers' lodge. Warder Fred Brown was returning from lunch to relieve Lange when he was confronted by the escapees. Brown did not resist. When Ryan realised Lange had tricked him, he jabbed the rifle into Lange's back and marched him <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> so Lange could pull the correct lever to open the tower gate. The two escapees then exited through the gate into the prison car park. To the escapees' dismay there were only two cars in the car park and one had a flat tyre.|$|E

6000|$|... "Put them down!" [...] said Grant, with {{a little}} {{impatient}} gesture; Breckenridge let the weapons fall but he {{was pleased to see}} the cook, who now stood {{at the foot of the}} stairway, slip softly forward and pick up one of them. Grant was looking at the door and did not see the man move <b>back</b> half-way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> as silently as he came.|$|R
50|$|Following the performance, {{the elder}} Strauss angrily tells his son {{that he had}} not {{authorized}} the performance, as the Countess had led him to believe. Schani leaves the festival in confusion and the Countess follows him home where they share another kiss. However, the romantic moment is interrupted by the Count, who, upon learning where the Countess had gone, left the party in a rage. Fortunately, Resi arrives in time to sneak in the back and replace the Countess, who then walks <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> front <b>stairs</b> to surprise her husband, as the crowd outside hums The Blue Danube Waltz.|$|R
2500|$|Klebold {{walked down}} the steps toward the cafeteria. He came up to Kirklin, who was already wounded and lying on the ground, weakly calling for help. Klebold said, [...] "Sure. I'll help you," [...] then shot Kirklin in the face, {{critically}} wounding him. Daniel Rohrbough and Sean Graves had descended the staircase when Klebold and Harris' attention was diverted by the students on the grass; Graves—paralyzed beneath the waist—had crawled into {{the doorway of the}} cafeteria's west entrance and collapsed. Klebold shot Rohrbough, who was already fatally wounded by the shots previously fired by Harris, at close range through the upper left chest and then stepped over the injured Sean Graves to enter the cafeteria. Officials speculated that Klebold went to the cafeteria to check on the propane bombs. Harris shot down the steps at several students sitting near the cafeteria's entrance, severely wounding and partially paralyzing 17-year-old Anne-Marie Hochhalter as she tried to flee. Klebold came out of the cafeteria and went <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> to join Harris.|$|E
60|$|When supper {{was over}} {{they went out}} into the streets to walk, but at the door the grey girl gave Thyme's arm a squeeze, her cheek a swift kiss, and turned <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E

60|$|One honored {{day this}} week even the Queen and the Queen Mother {{came down to}} the concert, and gave us incomparably the {{greatest}} event of our waning season. I had noticed all the morning a floral perturbation about the main entrance of the hotel, which settled into the form of banks of autumnal bloom on either side of <b>the</b> specially carpeted <b>stairs,</b> and put forth {{on the roof of the}} arcade in a crown, much bigger round than a barrel, of orange-colored asters, in honor of the Queen's ancestral house of Orange. Flags of blue, white, and red fluttered nervously about in the breeze from the sea, and imparted to us an agreeable anxiety not to miss seeing the Queens, as the Dutch succinctly call their sovereign and her parent; and at three o'clock we saw them drive <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> hotel. Certain officials in civil dress stood at the door of the concert-room to usher the Queens in, and a bareheaded, bald-headed dignity of military figure <b>backed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> before them. I would not rashly commit myself to particulars concerning their dress, but I am sure that the elder Queen wore black, and the younger white. The mother has one of the best and wisest faces I have seen any woman wear (and most of the good, wise faces in this imperfectly balanced world are women's) and the daughter one of the sweetest and prettiest. Pretty is the word for her face, and it showed pink through her blond veil, as she smiled and bowed right and left; her features are small and fine, and she is not above the middle height.|$|R
50|$|Mildred spots a boat {{attached}} to a breakwater and decides to hide Tabby in the cabin of the boat. After a wonderful day on the beach, Mildred tries to sneak some kippers to Tabby, but Ethel catches Mildred, who pretends {{to be looking for}} some mythical treasure on Cat's Head Rock in front of the cove in the boat on the breakwater. As <b>the</b> two head <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> cliff <b>stairs,</b> they witness Miss Hardbroom flying down to the beach on her broomstick with her own black cat, Morgana. Morgana runs to the boat and feeds on the kippers that were meant for Tabby. Miss Hardbroom spots both Tabby in the cabin and Morgana eating the fish. Stepping on board to investigate, she slips on a kipper, bangs her head and falls unconscious.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} hours of 26 December 1938, in Ballina, a fire broke out at Pearse Street, home and {{business}} premises of a J J Duncan. Garda Patten alerted the inhabitants of the houses on either side of Duncan's, then {{made his way to the}} upper floor of the building. He located four distressed members of the family, and urged them down <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> as <b>the</b> house was now well ablaze. However, when outside, he learned there were still more people in the house, and ran <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> burning <b>stairs</b> to find a barely conscious husband and wife, who he escorted outside. He was then informed that Mr Duncan could not be located; by now suffering from smoke inhalation, Patten made a third entry into the building, spending several minutes in an increasingly toxic environment in a vain search for Duncan. He had to be dragged from the premises himself, just as the ceiling collapsed. J J Duncan's remains were later found in the ruins.|$|R
6000|$|But in {{the hall}} Billy {{suddenly}} ejaculated, [...] "By Jove! Half a minute," [...] and ran <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> three at a time. Apparently he found what he had gone for on the landing, for I did not hear {{the opening of the}} drawing- room door. Then the Honourable Billy redescended with a sober, nonchalent air.|$|E
60|$|I ran <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> to {{take refuge}} in my own room. If there had been time to think, my thoughts, when I was alone again, would have caused me bitter suffering. But {{there was no time}} to think. Happily for the {{preservation}} of my calmness and my courage there was time for nothing but action.|$|E
60|$|My father rushed forward, but was borne back; and, in an instant, {{the hall}} was full of grim, ferocious faces. My father, {{trembling}} a little (or else it was the shadow cast by the flickering lamp), and with lips tight pressed, stood confronting them; while we women and children, too scared to even cry, shrank <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{time and}} {{circumstances}} were favourable to reflection. He {{tried to keep}} his thoughts to the current, unpleasant though it was, {{in which they had}} moved all day, and to think with what a romantic feeling he had looked forward to shaking his old friend by the hand before he died, and what a wide and cruel difference there was between the meeting they had had, and that which he had so often and so long anticipated. Still, he was disordered by waking to such sudden loneliness, and could not prevent his mind from running upon odd tales of people of undoubted courage, who, being shut up by night in vaults or churches, or other dismal places, had scaled great heights to get out, and fled from silence as they had never done from danger. This brought to his mind the moonlight through the window, and bethinking himself of it, he groped his way <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> crooked <b>stairs,</b> - but very stealthily, as though he were fearful of being overheard.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Bream {{said this}} with much {{deliberation}} and an emphatic nod for each word, while he gazed solemnly in Ruth's face. [...] "Not a bad fortune {{for an old}} bachelor, eh? Then," [...] he continued, after a moment's pause, [...] "when I was wrecked, {{two years ago in}} Australia, I took a fancy {{to have a look at}} the gold diggin's, so off I went to Bendigo, and I set to work diggin' for the mere fun o' the thing, and the very first day I turned up a nugget as big as my fist and two of the same sort the day after, an' then a lot o' little ones; in fact I had got hold of a first-rate claim, an' when I had dug away for a month or so I put it all in a big chest, sold the claim, and came straight home, bringin' the chest with me. I have it now, up in my cabin yonder. It well-nigh broke my <b>back</b> gittin' it <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> though my <b>back</b> ain't a weak one." ...|$|R
5000|$|The attic {{door and}} the third story: The longest one, it starts with Merrill finding out about the not-boarded attic door. Despite Graham's efforts to call him <b>back,</b> Merrill goes <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and manages to hold the door by {{climbing}} up a chair and putting his hands at the door. Trying to help, Graham looks {{for a way to}} hold the door. He gets a tall shelf and places it under the door. Knowing this is only a temporary solution, Graham gets his family and takes them to the kitchen and puts some chairs at the door to hold the aliens out of the room. There, he tells the [...] "third story", about Merrill, in which he dislocated his arm. While Graham is telling the story, the shelf is destroyed from the attic door slamming on top of it repeatedly and the aliens gain access to the house. Everyone goes down to the basement, the only safe room available, as the aliens begin forcing the kitchen door open.|$|R
60|$|So {{they came}} <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and {{out through the}} stone wall into the palace garden. The queen pressed her hand against the stone and it turned back into its place again. Then, beckoning to the prince, she hurried away down the garden. Before he {{followed}} {{he picked up a}} coal that lay near by, and put a cross upon the stone; then he hurried after her, and so came to the palace once more.|$|E
6000|$|But the {{independence}} of a drunken shoemaker is proverbial, and Morrison's meek spirit soared into lordly arrogance with his earliest cups. The first warning which the community had of his change of attitude was the conspicuous and even defiant closure of his shop, and the scornful rejection of custom, however urgent or necessitous. All Equity might go in broken shoes, for any patching or half-soling the people got from him. He went about collecting his small dues, and paying up his debts {{as long as the}} money lasted, in token of his resolution not to take any favors from any man thereafter. Then he retired to his house on one of the by streets, and by degrees drank himself past active offence. It was of course in his defiant humor that he came to visit Bartley, who had learned to expect him whenever Hannah failed to appear promptly at her work. The affair was always easily arranged. Bartley instantly assented, with whatever irony he liked, to Morrison's demands; he refused with overwhelming politeness even to permit him to give himself the trouble to support them by argument; he complimented Hannah inordinately {{as one of the most}} gifted and accomplished ladies of his acquaintance, and inquired affectionately after the health of each member of the Morrison family. When Morrison rose to go he always said, in shaking hands, [...] "Well, sir, if there was more like you in Equity a poor man could get along. You're a gentleman, sir." [...] After getting some paces away from the street door, he stumbled <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> to repeat, [...] "You're a gentleman!" [...] Hannah came during the day, and the wages remained the same: neither of the contracting parties regarded the increase so elaborately agreed upon, and Morrison, on becoming sober, gratefully ignored the whole transaction, though, by a curious juggle of his brain, he recurred to it in his next spree, and advanced in his new demand from the last rise: his daughter was now nominally in receipt of an income of forty dollars a week, but actually accepted four.|$|E

50|$|Sam Gamgee {{came to the}} Tower of Cirith Ungol {{to rescue}} Frodo.

50|$|Finally, Stan and Ollie get {{the piano}} to the top, where Ollie {{falls into a}} fountain. As they ring the bell of 1127 Walnut Avenue, the piano rolls {{back down to the}} street again.

She panics, believing that the Dorsa she left with is another apparition, and returns home to find Dorsa. She sees what appears to be Dorsa under their bed, but when trying to rescue her, she discovers with horror that it is an apparition. Escaping to the shelter, she finds the real Dorsa. The two are attacked by the chador apparition, which separates the two before Shideh manages to find Dorsa. She urges Dorsa <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> but is trapped when the floor begins to suck her down. Dorsa rescues Shideh and the two escape to the car, and Shideh drives them to Iraj's parents.

50|$|There {{is also a}} ghost who {{reportedly}} walks, staggers, or crawls <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and stops on the 17th step.
