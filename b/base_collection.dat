Recent exploration to that tract has resulted in a collection of 120 accessions of upland rice germplasm. They have been conserved in both National active collection and <b>base</b> <b>collection</b> centres for further utilisation as and when it will be required. Also a historical perspective on the genetical diversity of rice germplasm of the region has been highlighted. The characterization data revealed enormous morphological as well as agronomic variability among the landraces. Jeypore tract in southern Odisha has been identified as one such center of origin of rice. In the distant past rice moved from Odisha to places within and outside India. Genetic analysis of rice germplasm of the Jeypore tract in Odisha indicated significant role of these rice in the evolution of Japonica rice.(Source: http://www.ouat.ac.in/Research/rice.htm) ...|$|E

40|$|The size of Germplasm Collections {{has become}} an {{important}} limitation for theirr use in plant breeding programs. To overcome this limitation the Core Collection concept has been proposed. A Core Collection consists {{of a set of}} accessions selected to represent the genetic diversity of the <b>base</b> <b>collection</b> with minimum repetitiveness. This insures the conservation of maximum genetic variation, allowing rapid evaluation of germplasm and better access to the <b>base</b> <b>collection.</b> The brazilian germplasm Collection of Cassava is the largest national collection, and contains strategic genetic variation for the development of breeding programs worldwide. It consists of approximately 3350 accessions conserved in 7 regional Active Germplasm Banks. To develop the Core Collection a hierarchical stratification similar to that proposed by Cordeiro et al (1995) was used. Two key criteria were used for the stratification of the accessions: category and origin. According to category the accessions were classified as landraces or breeding materials. Within the landraces strutum, accessions were classified according to ecogeographical origin using the Geographic Information System. The selection {{of the members of the}} Core, was done trying to represent the genetic variability within each ecogeographic zone, incorporating the knowledge and experience of the curators.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Fatty acid, tocopherol, {{tocotrienol}} and carotene contents {{were assessed}} in four oil palm species from the National Centre of Agronomical Research of Cote d'lvoire, {{two of which}} were the basal Lame (HP 1) and Deli (HP 2) collections and two of which resulted from crossings between HP 1 and HP 2 varieties of Eleais guineensis, HP 3 and HP 4 being identified as {{the first and second}} cycle selection, respectively. RESULTS: Palm oil species were characterized by the richness in polyunsaturated fatty acids composition (48 - 60 %) compared to saturated fatty acids (40 - 52 %), especially the first variety, which was from the <b>base</b> <b>collection,</b> and the two hybrids ensuing from crossing. Total carotene content of those varieties was higher and accounted for 832 - 3575 mu g g(- 1), and the beta-carotene level (580 - 2390 mu g g(- 1)) was predominant. Total vitamin E content was 864 - 1124 mu g g(- 1), with a notable higher content of tocotrienols, especially gamma-and alpha-tocotrienol, ranging from 400 to 515 mu g g(- 1) and from 238 to 350 mu g g(- 1), respectively.

40|$|A core {{collection}} is {{a subset of}} accessions from a larger collection of a particular crop species that represents, with a minimum amount of repetitiveness, the genetic diversity of that crop species and its wild relatives. With limited resources, {{it is difficult to}} manage large germplasm collections. Criteria that have included geographical, morphological, biochemical and molecular data, have been used to analyze genetic diversity in order to construct core collections. DNA marker systems, which provide large number of polymorphic loci dispersed in the genome could be used efficiently for development of core collections. From <b>base</b> <b>collection</b> of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) including 560 accessions, a collection of 305 accessions, was sampled from different gene pools: 79. 7 % from European gene pool, 12. 8 % from South America and 7. 5 % from Middle America. This collection was analysed for seven seed traits (length, height, width, shape, colour, colour pattern and coat pattern- IPGRI descriptor), SDS-PAGE phaseoline patterns and E-AGT/M-GAC fluorescent AFLP primer combination. Core collections, consisting of r = 0. 18 x n accessions, were sampled by several sampling strategies, simple random sampling, random-stratified by log frequency of accessions by continent, random-stratified by log frequency of phaseoline pattern, that are not dependent of molecular markers, and one marker assisted sampling that maximize genetic diversity at AFLP marker loci. An independent verification of the core collection sampling efficiency was performed using geographical, morphological, biochemical and molecular data by comparing the genetic diversity found in each core collection with the variability of <b>base</b> <b>collection.</b> The AFLP-based strategy allowed to include the largest number of AFLP loci in the core collection (34 polymorphic loci out of 37 in <b>base</b> <b>collection),</b> all classes for seed characters but a smaller number of countries. The no marker-based sampling strategies reduced AFLP marker loci richness to n= 25 - 31 in the core collections. Our results confirmed that strategies based on information obtained from marker loci lead to retention of the maximum number of loci and are useful tool for plant breeders and germplasm collection curators to better understand the genetic diversity within a germplasm collection...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} little {{empirical}} work on how collections strategy {{can be used to}} maximise profits. The aim of this research was to investigate the impact that one particular collections strategy, called behaviour <b>based</b> <b>collections,</b> had on the costs, revenues and eventual collections outcome of defaulted microloans. This {{is one of the few}} studies on the collections function, and perhaps the first to investigate this aspect of collections strategy. Microloan books from different business units were analysed and compared. One business used a behaviour based strategy to collect on arrears, in which a client was expected to establish regular payment behaviour before repaying the arrears amount. The other used an arrears based strategy, where the client was expected to repay missed instalments immediately. Measurements of cash flow, eventual collections outcome, costs and change in credit risk were taken from each sample and tested using Mann-Whitney U tests and chi-square tests. The results show that the eventual collections outcome (whether the defaulted loan is rehabilitated or written off) does not vary according to collections strategy. For both strategies, as credit risk worsens, there is a decrease in revenue received; as credit risk improves, revenue received rises. In contrast to industry best practice, the research finds that behaviour <b>based</b> <b>collections</b> results in 3. 37 % more revenue when the loan is rehabilitated, and a 4. 54 % reduction in losses when the loan is written off. The research also finds that the cost of using a behaviour <b>based</b> <b>collections</b> strategy is lower than using an arrears based strategy.
