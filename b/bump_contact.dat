The large temporal drifts in zero pressure offset voltage at 600 C observed previously were significantly suppressed to allow improved reliable operation. This improvement {{was the result of}} further enhancement of the electrical and mechanical integrity of the bondpad/contact metallization, and the introduction of studded bump bonding on the pad. The stud <b>bump</b> <b>contact</b> promoted strong adhesion between the Au bond pad and the Au die-attach. The changes in the zero offset voltage and bridge resistance over time at temperature were explained by the microstructure and phase changes within the contact metallization, that were analyzed with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) ...|$|E

40|$|A new wafer level {{packaging}} technology ELASTec® {{has been}} developed; {{which uses a}} resilient <b>bump</b> <b>contact</b> system. The advantages are twofold; because {{on the one hand}} the elastic contact system simplifies wafer probing {{and on the other hand}} the elastic interconnects allow an increase in board level reliability. Excessive solder bump straining caused by the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients (CTE) between silicon and organic board materials can be avoided because of the compliance of the new contact system, which can take over the main part of the mismatch deformation. Since the electrical connection is made by an electrodeposited copper/nickel redistribution layer (RDL), placed on top of the bump surface, other failures risks than solder fatigue emerge which were avoided by parametric studies using finite element analyses (FEA).

40|$|Wafer-level {{simultaneous}} testing (WLST) {{where all}} chips on a wafer are tested and burned {{in at the}} same time is preferable in reducing the cost of obtaining Known Good Dies (KGD’s). At present, however, it is difficult to realize the WLST because it requires a probe card with some hundred thousand needles, leading to more than a ton of force needed for stable contact of all needles.

The paper presents research results of wide-section tire characteristics of the model I- 247 (1200 x 500 - 508) on the long length bumps under static loading by radial force and torque at the internal air pressure in the tire of 0. 35, 0. 20, and 0. 05 MPa. The research has been conducted on a special stand. As the bumps, were used two triangular prisms with the rounding vertex angles of 120 ° and 90 ° having radius of 100 mm. The threshold bumps were used as well. Their sizes were selected so that in all measuring options a tire was in <b>contact</b> with <b>bump.</b> The nature of tires load behavior on the bumps with radial and angular deformation and in contact with the plane, essentially, does not differ. With such shapes and sizes of <b>bumps</b> a <b>contact</b> surface appearance has less impact on the tire torsion stiffness than on the radial one. Thus, at a nominal internal tire pressure of 0. 35 MPa, a torsion stiffness of the tire is decreased, in average, by 5 %, while the radial one is reduced by 25 % when there is a transition from the contact on the plane to the <b>contact</b> with <b>bumps.</b> It should be noted that at the transition from the plane contact to the that of with bumps the limit values of the tire radial stiffness ratio are significantly reduced, namely: up to 50 % at internal tire pressure of 0. 20 and 0. 35 MPa, and up to 71 % at internal tire pressure of 0. 05 MPa. The results of experimental research enable the following mathematical modeling: full approximation of tire load characteristics in case of instability of its smoothing a single bump; maximum loads and calculation of load modes of units and systems when a vehicle overcomes engineering structures and large bumps, taking into account the nonlinear features of tire behavior in its radial and torsion deformation. </p...|$|R

[...] "If you were so bent on not losing what I might have to give you that you fortunately stuck to the ship, for poor Briss to pick you up, wasn't this also"--she roundly put it to me--"a good deal because you've been nursing all day the grievance with which I this morning so comfortably furnished you?" ...|$|R
40|$|Flip chip {{technology}} {{is an important}} process in microelectronics packaging. Flip chip interconnections by solder or adhesive require the processing of <b>bumps</b> on semiconductor <b>contact</b> pads. The requirement for cost reduction leads to the demand for reduced bumping cost. The selective chemical metallization of semiconductor wafers offers a potential low-cost alternative to established technologies. In this thesis a comprehensive investigation of chemical metal deposition on wafers was performed. It was demonstrated that an alkaline cleaning, followed by a double-zincate treatment {{can result in a}} fine-grained Zn layer, which provides strong bump adhesion. The influence of stabilizer in Ni bathes was studied. For the relation between critical stabilizer concentration and pad size a model was developed and experimentally verified. Effects of chemical metallization of functional wafers were investigated and countermeasures were found. A productive process for chemical bumping was developed, including a method for precise measurement of stabilizer concentration. According process requirements a bumping line was designed and realized. The capability of the process as well as uniformity and reliability of Ni bumps were demonstrated by successful bumping of different types of wafers. Taking into account different production scenarios a cost model of chemical bumping was set up. It could be shown that bumping at cost as low as 2. 10 € per wafer is possible. Finally the reliability of flip chips with Ni bumps was investigated. In stress tests using glued flip chips the reliability was limited by the adhesive materials only. Also for flip chip interconnects using Ni Under Bump Metallization and different types of solder an excellent stability in thermal and thermo-mechanical stress tests was demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of an effective technological process for the production of the electrostatic curved beam actuator capable {{to be used as a}} driving element in different devices such as microswitches or microvalves. Main attention was drawn to the investigation of electroplating technique as a critical process in the microactuator fabrication as well as to the design of the actuator. In addition, usability of ceramic substrates for the microactuator and microvalve production was examined. The idea behind it was that ceramic substrates can be preprocessed and delivered already with necessary electrical connections on it. This would make the entire production process simpler and cheaper. Several types of polished alumina (Al 2 O 3) substrates were used for this purpose. Electrostatic actuation principle was chosen for its good scaling properties to small dimensions, low power consumption, smaller size and higher switching speed. Curved shape of the actuator allows to reduce its pull-in voltage and thus to increase the amplitude of motion as compared to the parallel-plate structures. The material of the actuator is nickel. It was chosen for its good mechanical properties and relative simplicity of processing. Double layer nickel electroplating was used to produce the microactuator. The layers have different stress gradients controlled by current density during the electroplating process, making it possible to achieve the desired bending of the structure. Compared to bimetallic bending cantilever actuators, the curvature of the single-metal beam is less dependable on temperature and aging. Thus, more stable performance under changing working conditions was ensured. In order to avoid sticking of the microactuator to the isolation layer in the closed state, an array of stand-off bumps was added on the back-side of the beam. These <b>bumps</b> reduce the <b>contact</b> area and increase the distance between the actuator and the isolation layer. Fifteen design variants of the actuator differing in length and width were fabricated in order find the most effective solution for given system requirements. Based on the actuators technological process developed in this work, a simple electrostatic microvalve was designed and produced. Final variants of microvalve were fabricated on a standard 380 µm thick silicon wafer. Gas inlet channel as well as the electrodes and the actuator itself are all placed on the same substrate in order to reduce the size and cost of the system. During characterization, mechanical stability of the actuators and microvalves were studied by means of drop, temperature and shear tests in order to prove the reliability of the system. System performance tests proved stable pull-in voltages from 8, 6 V to 11, 6 V. Maximal gas flow through the valve was 110 ± 5 ml/min at applied differential pressure of 2 bar...|$|R
