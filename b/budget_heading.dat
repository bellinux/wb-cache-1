40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with an aspect of public sector resource allocation, specifically the mechanisms whereby United Kingdom central government public expenditure within the New Towns <b>budget</b> <b>heading</b> was utilised for the planned expansion {{of the town of}} Northampton from 1965 to 1985. The distinctive feature of the town expansion process associated with Northampton was that, {{for the first time in}} the history of the New Town programme, such expansion involved a designated area which contained within it the whole of a County Borough. The consequences of this were that the central government and its agent, the development corporation, found themselves involved in establishing a pattern of allocative, decision making relationships which included a major role for the County Borough. A partnership was established and codified between central government and the County Borough of Northampton that involved institutional, functional and process arrangements of a unique kind, that have not, in total, been replicated elsewhere in the New Town programme. This unique partnership between central government and the County Borough of Northampton provided a focal point for the wider consideration of the role of 'policy communities' in central-local relations. The detailed consideration of the policy community associated with Northampton's town expansion has been based on the model devised by R A W Rhodes. The use of the model in this way has both tested it as a methodological tool and provided an opportunity for indicating possible further areas for development. In addition, its specific application to the Northampton experience has raised issues and indicated possible policy options that are of significance for other centrally funded urban development schemes such as the regeneration of the United Kingdom's inner city areas...|$|E

Accordingly, DG CSIR constituted an Advisory Committee vide OM no. 8 / 8 / 2006 -RDPD dated 11 September 2006 to study and submit recommendations. As a preliminary exercise some members of this Committee met and deliberated on the issues and compiled a draft manual. This draft was then discussed in a full meeting of the Advisory Committee which met on 13 November 2006 at New Delhi and finalized the recommendations. Inputs were sought and received from various CSIR library professionals. The present Manual is a result of all these deliberations and inputs. The Manual touches upon all important functional modules for the management of LICs of CSIR, like collection development, services, management issues and operational parameters. The important recommendations of this Manual are:- In keeping with the times, the Advisory group suggests that henceforth all the CSIR libraries and Information Centres, located in laboratories across India-and known by various names – be christened as Science & Technology Knowledge Resource Centres (KRC). - Strengthen / modernize the infrastructure including adequate computer and communication hardware and relevant software- Provision of enhanced budgetary support for meeting each individual laboratory’s commitment to CSIR consortium- Provision of regular library budget for laboratory specific requirements not covered under CSIR consortium- Recategorization of <b>budget</b> <b>heads</b> towards expenditure for binding, purchase of ephemeral materials, reprints and translation charges, etc., from capital to recurring (more specifically contingency) <b>budget</b> <b>head.</b> - Provision of professionally qualified and competent manpower for execution of tasks of specialized nature- In-service training to existing manpower to enhance their skills and knowledg...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{empirical}} study on the current usage of quantitative techniques for R&D project management in "Fortune 500 " industrial firms are presented. A nonrandom sample of 40 respondents from 29 firms were selected to represent a mix of industrial sectors and geographic regions. The information was obtained via personal interview of R&D <b>budget</b> <b>heads</b> and some high level staff. Extensive demographic data on the respondent and his company were collected and related to familiarity and usage of project management techniques. Data were also collected on the perceived impact of techniques on project decision making, and any recent/planned changes in the cadre of techniques. Heavy use and high perceived impact of financial methods for project selection, selective use of network models, some dissatisfaction over the methods available for project scheduling and control, and no usage of mathematical programming models for R&D resource allocation were key findings. As a result, R&D managers must have {{a thorough understanding of}} the capital budgeting techniques used by their organizations. Also, the initial training for R&D managers in project management should provide a broad-based introduction to the available methods and techniques, while emphasizing organizational "fit" considerations. Finally, it is suggested that R&D managers enlist the support of management scientists in the development of decision support systems for R&D project management, especially for multi-project planning and control. research and development, project management, professional, OR/MS implementation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} EC budget over the period 1985 - 89. It begins from the premise that economic variables influence both a member state’s contributions to the finance of the budget and its receipts under the various spending programmes. We examine this hypothesis using data from 5 years relating to all EC members. A regression model is fitted {{in order to establish}} whether (and to what degree) a member state’s contributions to the budget and the receipts it can expect under the main <b>budget</b> <b>heads,</b> are likely to increase with the country’s income. The principal findings are that a country’s GDP is an accurate guide to the contributions it can expect to make but a much less reliable guide to receipts. The result is that net contributions are not strongly correlated with GDP. We find also that economic indicators such as unemployment rates and the proportion of the population employed in agriculture have limited additional explanatory power. The paper extends the analysis by exploring how the position might have changed had recent moves to switch more EC spending from agricultural price support to structural measures taken place earlier. This simulation assumes that the structural part of the budget had been expanded while the agricultural price support remained the same, the extra spending being financed by a proportionate increase in contributions. It emerges that such measures would have made a member’s net contributions slightly more sensitive to GDP. But {{it would not have been}} sufficient to give the budget a significant role in terms of redistributing income from poorer member states to richer ones...|$|R
