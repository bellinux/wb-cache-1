Rico and a <b>bus</b> <b>load</b> of prisoners and guards were trapped on the moon after a hailstorm, with Rico helping get the survivors free. Corrupt guards began killing prisoners on their march to safety {{in order to preserve}} oxygen for themselves and Rico was left as the only survivor, after killing the remaining guards. While he was rescued soon after, the prison officials had him modified on spurious grounds: he'd survived on the moon surface and they wanted to discourage other prisoners from believing this could be done to escape. For the rest of his sentence, he received 'personal' treatment from the guards: the lack of crooked judges in the early days meant any caught were put through hell.|$|E

50|$|In 1992, Diaz-Balart {{defeated}} fellow State Senator Javier Souto in the Republican primary for {{the newly}} created 21st District. No other party put up a candidate, assuring Diaz-Balart's election. He was unopposed for reelection in 1994, 1996, 2000 and 2002 and defeated Democrat, Patrick Cusack, with 75 percent in 1998. The Cusack campaign reported a number of violations at the voting places, but were ignored. In Miami a <b>bus</b> <b>load</b> of Cuban Americans, ex political prisoners without U.S. citizenship voted time and again at different voting places. A strong disparaging radio campaign against Mr. Cusack {{the day before the}} election was spearheaded by Lincoln's father, Rafael Diaz-Balart, and joined among others by Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penellas, a democrat and personal friend of Lincoln, then Commissioner Thomas Regalado, and Ileana Ros-Lehtenin. They even alleged that Mr. Cusack lied about being an attorney licensed to practice in Florida. Anthony Verdugo of the Christian Coalition ignored Mr. Cusack's complaint about erroneous facts on the coalition's scorecard that was circulated in area churches, even though Mr. Cusack was a faithful Evangelical Christian with a prison ministry for many years.|$|E

Places of interest include Wolfshall Pass, commonly known as Boterekwa due to the winding of the road as it negotiates its way up and between mountains. Midway through Boterekwa, there is Dun raven Falls which is about 100m from the road.

5000|$|He was {{governor}} of the Commonwealth during the strife over school busing following Judge W. Arthur Garrity's 1974 decision to desegregate Boston public schools through court-mandated redistricting of the Boston school system, including busing some students out of their neighborhoods to end a pattern of racial segregation in the schools. Sargent had previously vetoed attempts to repeal or water-down the state's Racial Imbalance Act, which prohibited state aid to racially imbalanced school districts. When Sargent called for obeying the federal court order, anti-busing forces complained {{that he and his}} neighbors in the well-to-do suburban Boston town of Dover, Massachusetts did not have to share any of the burden of desegregating Boston schools. Carl Sheridan, a former Dover police chief, said this of the incident, [...] "I think people will most remember him for the busing situation. I remember one time a <b>bus</b> <b>load</b> of demonstrators came out to Dover looking for Sargent and his house. But because the town had no street lights, they got out of the bus and were standing in the pitch black. They got back in the bus and left. Sargent was still laughing about that two weeks ago." ...|$|E

The new group was to be an [...] "informal, unincorporated" [...] alliance of klaverns which would remain active {{in the state of}} Georgia. Green was elected to the post of Grand Dragon, the usual designation of a state leader of the KKK. Initially there were only twelve klaverns in the Association. In October 1945 the group conducted the first cross burning since the end of World War II atop Stone Mountain. At the time Green told the press that cross burning had been suspended during wartime because [...] "all factions had to unite to win the war".

For example, in <b>bus</b> <b>load</b> forecasting, the amount of outliers appearing in the <b>bus</b> <b>load</b> data cannot be neglectable, therefore researchers have to utilize a nave method to clean the data in the first place.
