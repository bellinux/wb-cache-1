40|$|A pilot-scale {{membrane}} {{process for}} the concentration of effluent from an alkaline peroxide mechanical pulping (APMP) plant was investigated. Specifically, the cross-flow velocity and volume reduction were optimized again for a higher flux and a lower system energy consumption. A mathematical model was established to obtain the optimal parameters. Estimates were obtained of the expected savings in energy and water. The obtained optimal concentration conditions were: molecular weight cut-off at 10, 000 Dalton, trans-membrane pressure at 3 <b>bar,</b> <b>feed</b> temperature at 50 oC, cross-flow velocity at 2 m/s, and volume reduction at 0. 9. The average permeate flux under these conditions was 43. 21 l/m 2. h. The total solids content was increased from 25. 47 g/L in the feed to 128. 36 g/L in the concentrate. The permeate had low total solids content of 11. 03 g/L, Chemical Oxygen Demand of 9180 mg/l, and Biochemical Oxygen Demand of 5870 mg/L. Such qualities would allow the permeate to be reused in the APMP process after a light biochemical treatment.

High reaction temperature employed in the accelerated catalyst aging resulted in large amounts of carbonaceous deposition with high aromaticity, which {{was found to be}} the principal deactivation cause.

The gaseous products are then separated in a demethanizer {{followed by a}} deethanizer unit and finally sent to a C splitter for the final purification step. Cryogenic distillation of ethylene from ethane is the most energy-intensive unit operation process in the chemical industry. Therefore, {{the development of more}} energy-efficient processes for ethylene purification is highly desirable. Membrane-based separation has been proposed as an alternative option for replacement or debottlenecking of C splitters but current polymer membrane materials exhibit insufficient mixed-gas CH/CH selectivity (< 7) to be technically and economically attractive. In this work, a highly selective carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membrane derived from a novel spirobisindane-based polyimide of intrinsic microporosity (PIM- 6 FDA) was developed and characterized. PIM- 6 FDA showed a single-stage degradation process under an inert nitrogen atmosphere which commenced at ∼ 480 °C.

40|$|The major {{challenge}} in membrane filtration is fouling which reduces the membrane performance. Fouling is mainly {{due to the}} adhesion of foulants on the membrane surfaces. In this work, we studied the fouling behaviour of polystyrene-b-poly(4 -vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P 4 VP) isoporous membrane and the mussel inspired polydopamine/L-cysteine isoporous zwitterionic membrane. Polystyrene-b-poly(4 -vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P 4 VP) isoporous membranes were fabricated via self-assembly and non-solvent induced phase separation method. Subsequently, the isoporous membrane was modified by a mild mussel-inspired polydopamine (PDA) coating; the isoporous surface structure and the water flux was retained. Zwitterionic L-cysteine was further anchored on the PDA coated membranes via Michael addition reaction at pH 7 and 50 °C to alleviate their antifouling ability with foulants solution. The membranes were thoroughly characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and zeta potential measurements. Contact angle and dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were carried out to examine the hydrophilicity. The pH-responsive behaviour of the modified membrane remains unchanged and antifouling ability after PDA/L-cysteine functionalization was improved.

40|$|Using a multi-effect {{evaporation}} {{system to}} concentrate the effluent from alkaline peroxide mechanical pulping (APMP) plants {{is known to}} require a high energy consumption. In order to improve the situation, a polyethersulfone membrane was used to concentrate the effluent of APMP plants beforehand. An orthogonal experimental design was applied and a mathematical model was established to optimize the filtration parameters. An estimation of potential energy and water savings from this new concentration process was developed. The optimal filtration conditions obtained were: molecular weight cut-off at 10, 000 Dalton, trans-membrane pressure at 3 <b>bar,</b> <b>feed</b> temperature at 50 oC, cross-flow velocity at 420 rpm, and volume reduction factor at 0. 93. The average permeate flux under these conditions was 45. 31 l/m 2. h. The total solids content was increased from 14. 74 g/l in the feed to 95. 04 g/l in the concentrate. The permeate had low total solid contents of 8. 75 g/l, Chemical Oxygen Demand of 6696 mg/l, and Biochemical Oxygen Demand of 4383 mg/l. Such qualities would allow the permeate to be reused in the alkaline peroxide mechanical pulping process.

Table 5 shows the selectivity of O 2 /N 2, CO 2 /N 2, and CO 2 /CH 4 for the PIM- 1 and f-MWCNTs/PIM- 1 MMM, measured at 2 bar. At 0.5 to 2 wt.% f-MWCNTs loading the selectivity of CO 2 /N 2 and O 2 /N 2 {{was found to be}} higher than for pure PIM- 1. The high selectivity values of O 2 /N 2 at 0.5 to 2 wt.% f-MWCNTs loading might have resulted due to the intimate interface interaction of f-MWCNTs-polymer chain. In contrary, the CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity of the f-MWCNTs MMM is worse compared with the pure PIM- 1 membrane. The functional groups on the MWCNTs have a significant role in gas selectivity. The PEG group, confirmed by FTIR in Figure 4, has stronger interaction with a polar gas, such as CO 2 than a nonpolar gas, e.g., N 2. In that case the polar gas solubility can be enhanced and the gas permeability be increased which facilitates the improvement of the total CO 2 /N 2 selectivity. However, there is no improvement in the CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity as f-MWCNTs loading increased from 0.5 to 3 wt.% in the polymer matrix.|$|R

Chemical agent (coagulant) that used for coagulation in this research is alum and PAC, Pressure used in this operation is 5 - 7 <b>Bar.</b> Coagulation <b>feed’s</b> turbidity os 40 – 60 NTU. Obtained the result that the proper coagulant using daf for green water is PAC. For PAC, the optimum concentration is 25 gr/L, while alum is 50 gr/l.. This research also proved that the DAF pretreatment before ultrafiltration in green water treatment can helped out the works of ultrafiltration membrane...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{technical}} barriers for ceramic membranes is its scale up potential. The conventional ceramic membranes/modules originally developed for liquid phase applications are costly and not suitable for high temperature applications. One of the objectives under this project {{is the development of}} a ceramic membrane/module, which is economical and suitable for high temperature applications proposed under this project (200 - 300 C). During this period, we initiated the fabrication of a prototype ceramic membrane module which can be (1) qualified for the proposed application temperature, and (2) cost acceptable for large scale applications. A prototype ceramic membrane bundle (3 -inch diameter and 35 -inch L) has been prepared, which passes the temperature stability requirement. It also meets {{the low end of the}} burst pressure requirement, i. e., 500 - 750 psi. In the next period, we will continue the improvement of this prototype module to upgrade its burst pressure to 1000 to 1500 psi range. In addition, bench-top experimental study has been conducted in this period to verify satisfactorily the simulated results for the process scheme developed in the last report, which took into the consideration of streamlining the pre- and post-treatment. The sensitivity analysis indicates that membrane surface area requirement is a key operating parameter based upon the criteria of the CO conversion, hydrogen recovery and CO impurity level. A preliminary optimization study has been performed in this period based upon the key operating parameters determined above. Our result shows that at 40 <b>bar</b> <b>feed</b> pressure a nearly complete CO conversion and > 95 % hydrogen recovery can be achieved with the CO impurity level at {approx} 3500 ppm. If the hydrogen recovery ratio is lowered, the CO impurity level can be reduced further. More comprehensive optimization study will be performed in the 2 nd half of Yr III to focus on the reduction of the CO impurity level with a reasonable hydrogen recovery ratio...|$|R
