25|$|Bookbinding is {{the process}} of {{physically}} assembling a book from an ordered stack of paper sheets that are folded together into sections or sometimes left as a stack of individual sheets. The stack is then bound together along one edge by either sewing with thread through the folds or by a layer of flexible adhesive. Alternative methods to binding a stack together that are cheaper but less permanent include loose-leaf rings, individual screw posts or binding posts, twin loop spine coils, plastic spiral coils, and plastic spine combs. For protection, the bound stack is either wrapped in a flexible cover or attached to stiff boards. Finally, an attractive cover is adhered to the boards and a label with identifying information is attached to the covers along with additional decoration. Book artists or specialists in <b>book</b> <b>decoration</b> can greatly expand the previous explanation to include book like objects of visual art with high value and artistic merit of exceptional quality in addition to the book's content of text and illustrations.|$|E

50|$|After the Cathach of St. Columba, <b>book</b> <b>decoration</b> became {{increasingly}} {{more complex and}} new styles from other cultures were introduced. Carpet pages - entire pages of ornamentation with no text - were inserted, usually {{at the start of}} each Gospel. The geometric motifs and interlaced patterns may have been influences from Coptic Egypt or elsewhere in the Byzantine Middle East. The increasing use of animal ornamentation was an Anglo-Saxon contribution of its animal style. All of these influences and traditions combined into what could be called a new Hiberno-Saxon style, with the Book of Durrow in the later 7th century being the first of its type. The Lindisfarne Gospels is another famous example.|$|E

In my Bachelor Thesis, I firstly focus on the personality of Johannes Gensfleisch, the inventor of book-printing called Gutenberg, and the printing technique. In addition, I deal with the graphic techniques that are used in early press processes. However, my greatest attention here is devoted to the Prague press before 1500, where the greatest printing personalities are mentioned, who deserved the most in view of the development of the book culture. I am describing individual printing houses and their most interesting publications produced with a rich graphical decoration. Individual chapters are devoted in this section to prints of Jonathan of Vysoké Mýto, Severín-Kampa's printing house or to printer Beneda. Then I examine printing houses that developed their activity after the year 1500 and prints reaching higher qualitative values due to their woodprint [...] ...|$|R
