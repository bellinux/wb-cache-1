40|$|Abstract Foraging mode {{influences}} the dominant sen-sory modality {{used by a}} forager and likely the strategies of information gathering used in foraging and anti-predator contexts. We assessed three components of visual infor-mation gathering in a sit-and-wait avian predator, the <b>black</b> <b>phoebe</b> (Sayornis nigricans) : configuration of the visual field, degree of eye movement, and scanning behavior through head-movement rates. We found that black phoe-bes have larger lateral visual fields than similarly sized ground-foraging passerines, as well as relatively narrower binocular and blind areas. Black phoebes moved their eyes, but eye movement amplitude was relatively smaller than in other passerines. Black phoebes may compensate for eye movement constraints with head movements. The rate of head movements increased before attacking prey in com-parison to non-foraging contexts and before movements between perches. These findings suggest that black phoe-bes use their lateral visual fields, likely subtended by areas of high acuity in the retina, to track prey items in a three-dimensional space through active head movements. These head movements may increase depth perception, motion detection and tracking. Studying information gathering through head movement changes, rather than body posture changes (head-up, head-down) as generally presented in the literature, may allow us {{to better understand the}} mechanisms of information gathering from a comparative perspective...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} rural residential development and landscape composition on breeding birds in Placer County’s foothill oak woodlands. Point count survey data were used to construct generalized linear models for individual species ’ abundance or probability of occurrence, based on two sets of variables: GIS-derived landscape characteristics, including development density, oak woodland proportion, and habitat diversity; and field-collected local habitat parameters. We found that many species examined were sensitive to either development density or landscape composition at some distance between 250 and 4, 000 m. Of the 48 breeding species common enough to analyze statistically, the occurrence of 24 species {{was significantly associated with}} landscape characteristics. Species shown to be associated with development density and/or urban edge proximity included the lark sparrow (-), Rufouscrowned sparrow (-), western meadowlark (-), <b>black</b> <b>Phoebe</b> (+), house finch (+) and western scrub-jay (+). Several other species were not development-sensitive but were positively associated with the proportion of oak woodland found in the surrounding landscape. For a subset of locations, some species also exhibited responses to local habitat variables, suggesting that further investigation of the importance of landscape vs. local factors is warranted. The diversity of responses observed across a range of species requires the recommendation of a multifaceted conservation strategy for oak woodland birds and their habitat...|$|E
