"Gone for Goode" [...] {{marks the}} first {{performance}} of Richard Belzer as Detective John Munch, a character the actor has played in more than 300 television episodes {{in a number of}} shows, including Homicide and [...] Levinson said Belzer was a [...] "lousy actor" [...] during his first audition with the [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] script. Levinson asked Belzer to take some time to reread and practice the material, then come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>read</b> it again. During his second reading, Levinson said Belzer was [...] "still terrible", but that the actor eventually found confidence in his performance. [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] included guest appearances by actors who later become much more widely known. Steve Harris, who later achieved fame playing Eugene Young on the ABC legal drama The Practice, played an uncooperative suspect who repeatedly lies to Munch during questioning. Alexander Chaplin, who later played speechwriter James Hobert on the ABC sitcom Spin City, portrayed the alleged murderer Johnny in [...] "Gone for Goode". The comedic confession scenes involving Jim Grollman as accused murderer Jerry Jempson were almost entirely improvised.|$|E
500|$|The book, or {{elements}} of it, {{has been mentioned}} multiple times in United States politics. The image of the Cat balancing many objects on his body while in turn balancing himself on a ball has been included in political cartoons and articles. Political caricaturists have portrayed both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush in this way. In 2004, MAD magazine published [...] "The Strange Similarities Between the Bush Administration and the World of Dr. Seuss", an article which matched quotes from White House officials to excerpts taken from Dr. Seuss books, and in which George W. Bush's State of the Union promises were contrasted with the Cat vowing (in part), [...] "I can hold up the cup and the milk and the cake! [...] I can hold up these books! [...] And the fish on a rake!" [...] In 2007, during the 110th Congress, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid compared the impasse over a bill to reform immigration with the mess created by the Cat. He read lines of the book from the Senate floor. He then carried forward his analogy hoping the impasse would be straightened out for [...] "If you go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>read</b> Dr. Seuss, the cat manages {{to clean up the}} mess." [...] In 1999, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp featuring the Cat in the Hat.|$|E
500|$|The first Homicide season {{featured}} the first performances of Richard Belzer as Detective John Munch, a character the actor has been credited for in 459 television episodes (...) in nine different television series, including Homicide and [...] Levinson asked Belzer {{to audition for}} the part after hearing the comedian ranting on The Howard Stern Show, where Belzer was a frequent guest. Levinson said Belzer was a [...] "lousy actor" [...] during his first audition with the [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] script. Levinson asked Belzer {{to take some time}} to reread and practice the material, then come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>read</b> it again. During his second reading, Levinson said Belzer was [...] "still terrible", but that the actor eventually found confidence in his performance. Daniel Baldwin was cast as Beau Felton, and dyed his naturally blond hair black for the role. Baldwin {{became one of the most}} vocal supporters of the show, giving many press interviews about it and defending it amid declining ratings. Baldwin declared, [...] "Homicide is the best material I've had the chance to do." [...] Melissa Leo was cast as Kay Howard, which was considered a particularly strong part compared to other female characters in police dramas at the time, which were usually limited to love interests or minor parts. While most cast members shadowed real-life Baltimore detectives to prepare for the roles, Leo did not because, she said, [...] "I don't like to look at the horror that's in the world." [...] Wendy Hughes was cast as medical examiner Carol Blythe.|$|E

2500|$|Like the Corbridge Lanx, the Risley Park one {{was done}} in a raised relief style with cast figures. The {{inscription}} [...] "round the foot at bottom" [...] was on the <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>reads</b> [...] "Exsuperius episcopus ecclesice Bagiensi dedit" [...] ("Bishop Exuperius gives this to the church of Bagiensi"). This has inspired several different possible theories of the lanx's origin, depending on interpretation of the word [...] "Bagiensi".|$|R

2500|$|According to Cimino, {{he would}} call Washburn while on the road {{scouting}} for locations and feed him notes on dialogue and story. Upon reviewing Washburn's draft, Cimino said, [...] "I came <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>read</b> it and I just could not believe what I read. It was like {{it was written by}} somebody who was... mentally deranged." [...] Cimino confronted Washburn at the Sunset Marquis in LA about the draft, and Washburn supposedly replied that he couldn't take the pressure and had to go home. Cimino then fired Washburn. Cimino later claimed to have written the entire screenplay himself. Washburn's response to Cimino's comments were, [...] "It's all nonsense. It's lies. I didn't have a single drink the entire time I was working on the script." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of the work, Andrew Sullivan wrote [...] "you cannot read [...] on Romeo and Juliet or Antony and Cleopatra {{without seeing}} those {{works in a}} new light. You cannot read his account of Rousseau's La {{nouvelle}} Heloise without wanting to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>read</b> it—more closely—again...Bloom had a gift for reading reality—the impulse to put your loving face to it and press your hands against it". Recollecting his friend in an interview, Bellow said [...] "Allan inhaled books and ideas the way {{the rest of us}} breathe air...People only want the factual truth. Well, the truth is that Allan was a very superior person, great-souled. When critics proclaim the death of the novel, I sometimes think they are really saying that there are no significant people to write about. [...] Allan was certainly one." ...|$|E

50|$|Booth {{runs down}} the street <b>and</b> <b>back</b> to the theater to find himself back in the present. He notices that the script he is holding is titled What To Do When Booth Comes <b>Back</b> <b>and</b> <b>reads</b> through it to {{discover}} that everything {{that happened in the}} speakeasy was scripted. Booth realizes that ghosts from his past were putting on a very special encore performance, for him alone, to force him from his ennui and nostalgia for the past and to send him back to live his life in the present with new energy and focus. Sperry and Willis are waiting for him and demand to know if he is there to work. Booth asserts himself, overriding Sperry and demanding a student's obedience from Willis. Impressed, Willis tells Sperry to run along and listens as Booth says that he will someday explain what happened. The rehearsal for the new play proceeds as scheduled.|$|R

60|$|Lever {{lived in}} an age so full of great novelists that, perhaps, he is not prized as he should be. Dickens, Bulwer, Thackeray, Trollope, George Eliot, were his contemporaries. But when we turn <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>read</b> him once more, we see that Lever, too, was a worthy member of that famous company--a romancer for boys and men.|$|E
50|$|Two {{years later}} in 1984, Angel moved to Seattle and found his old notes on the game. After a few {{positive}} play tests with family {{he decided to go}} for it. Knowing the words for the game were critical, he went into his <b>back</b> yard <b>and</b> <b>read</b> the entire dictionary to compile the original word list. Two others then joined the company and they produced the first 1,000 games in Angel's apartment.|$|R
60|$|Now observe, {{this was}} not to be seen <b>and</b> <b>read</b> only by the catechumen when he first entered the church; every one who at any time entered, was {{supposed}} to look <b>back</b> <b>and</b> to <b>read</b> this writing; their daily entrance into the church was thus made a daily memorial of their first entrance into the spiritual Church; and we shall find {{that the rest of the}} book which was opened for them upon its walls continually led them in the same manner to regard the visible temple as in every part a type of the invisible Church of God.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the things}} I am really enjoying about this {{semester}} is teaching my graduate seminar in conservation biology. It has been fun going <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> the classics <b>and</b> also expanding out into the newer literature. Since I am also teaching a class in marine conservation I am trying to {{pay special attention to}} non-marine topics for regular flavor conservation biology There are few topics I consider more ‘non-marine’ than fire ecology, and this recent paper by Trauernicht et al. in Ecology and Evolution does a great job of looking at a conservation issue with multiple moving points. In this paper “Cultural legacies, fire ecology, and environmental change in the Stone Country of Arnhem Land and Kakadu National Park, Australia” they look at the interactions between (pay attention now) Aboriginal cultural practices including both 1) fire management via prescribed burning and 2) incorporation of Water Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) and 3) Australian government prescribed fire management across two areas. Get all that? Right, it’s a complex story...|$|R

He knew what he was up against, and there were difficulties he had not told Festing about.|$|E
60|$|Her pulses {{ceased to}} beat, her blood to flow, {{her heart to}} throb. All seemed to freeze within her except her mind. And that leaped fearfully over the first lines of a letter--then feverishly on to the close--only to fly <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>read</b> again. Then she dropped the book. She hid her face on Slingerland's breast. She {{clutched}} him with frantic hands. She clung there, her body all held rigid, as if some extraordinary strength or inspiration or joy had suddenly inhibited weakness.|$|E
60|$|My Lords, {{you have}} now seen what was the {{situation}} of the country in Sujah Dowlah's time, prior to Mr. Hastings's interference with the government of it, what it was during his government, and what situation it was in when Lord Cornwallis left it. Nothing now remains but to call your Lordships' attention to perhaps the most extraordinary part of these transactions. But before we proceed, we will beg leave to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>read</b> to your Lordships the Nabob's letter of the 24th February, 1780.|$|E
5000|$|A {{man is a}} fool not to put {{everything}} he has, at any given moment, into what he is creating. You're there now doing the thing on paper. You're not killing the goose, you're just producing an egg. So I don't worry about inspiration, or anything like that. It's a matter of just sitting down and working. I have never had the problem of a writing block. I've heard about it. I've felt reluctant to write on some days, for whole weeks, or sometimes even longer. I'd much rather go fishing, for example, or go sharpen pencils, or go swimming, or what not. But, later, coming <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> what I have produced, I am unable to detect {{the difference between what}} came easily and when I had to sit down and say, [...] "Well, now it's writing time and now I'll write."

When she learns {{that her daughter}} in Spain is pregnant, Doña María decides to make a pilgrimage to the shrine of Santa María de Cluxambuqua. Pepita goes along as company and to supervise the staff. When Doña María is out at the shrine, Pepita stays at the inn and writes a letter to her patron, the Abbess, complaining about her misery and loneliness. Doña María sees the letter on the table when she gets <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>reads</b> it. Later, she asks Pepita about the letter, and Pepita says she tore it up because the letter was not brave. Doña María has new insight into {{the ways in which}} her own life and love for her daughter have lacked bravery. She writes her [...] "first letter" [...] (actually Letter LVI) of courageous love to her daughter, but two days later, returning to Lima, she and Pepita are on the bridge when it collapses.|$|R

6000|$|And, forthwith, {{she began}} upon the first chapter; and having read five lines of this, she went <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>read</b> the title page, {{suddenly}} remembering that Mr Croft liked {{to begin a}} book at the very beginning. Miss Annie had been accustomed to read to her father, and she read aloud very well, and liked it. As she sat there, shaded by a great locust tree, which had dropped so many yellow leaves upon the grass, that, now and then, it could not help letting a little fleck of sunshine come down upon her, sometimes gilding for a moment her light-brown hair, sometimes touching {{the end of a}} crimson ribbon she wore, and again resting for a brief space on the toe of a very small boot just visible at the edge of her dress, Lawrence looked at her, and said to himself: [...] "Is it possible that this is the rather pale young girl in black, who gave me change from behind the desk of Mr Candy's Information Shop? I don't believe it. That young person sprang up, temporarily, and is defunct. This is some one else." ...|$|E
60|$|We now {{return to}} the story. And here, I suppose, {{is the place where}} those sagacious children, who, when they are reading a book in which {{entertainment}} and instruction are combined, always skip all the instruction, and read only the story, will begin to read again, after having turned over the leaves of this chapter thus far, seeing they contain only explanations of the mode of navigating a ship, and saying nothing about Hilbert and Rollo. Now, before going any farther, I wish to warn all such readers, {{that they will not be}} able to comprehend at all clearly the complicated difficulties which Hilbert and the others got into in respect to the lottery without understanding all that has been explained in the preceding pages of this chapter. I advise them, therefore, if they have skipped any of it, to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>read</b> it all, and to read it slowly too, and with the utmost attention. And I advise them, moreover, if they do not perfectly understand it all, to ask some older person to read it over with them and explain it to them. If they are not willing to do this, but insist on skipping the first part of the chapter, I advise them to make complete work of it, and skip the last half too; for they certainly will not understand it.|$|E

60|$|Fire {{lights and}} shades from the shaking flames struck in a {{butterfly}} flutter on the underparts of the mantelshelf, and upon the reader's cheek as he sat. Presently, {{and all at}} once, a much greater intentness pervaded his face: he turned <b>back</b> again, <b>and</b> <b>read</b> anew the subject that had arrested his eyes. He was a man whose countenance varied with his mood, though it kept somewhat {{in the rear of}} that mood. He looked sad when he felt almost serene, and only serene when he felt quite cheerful. It is a habit people acquire who have had repressing experiences.|$|R
5000|$|Bradford City manager Jim Jefferies was {{impressed}} with Bennett and offered him a trial at the Yorkshire club. On 8 February 2002, Wrexham manager Denis Smith signed him on a short-term contract til {{the end of the}} 2001-02 Football League. He made his league debut against Port Vale on 6 March 2002, partnering Trinidad & Tobago international Dennis Lawrence in the heart of defence. He was assessed as [...] "enjoying a remarkable start, looking composed at the <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> the game superbly" [...] by the fans, who had contributed money to sign the player. However, with the Welsh side 4th from bottom in the league, relegation was confirmed {{at the end of the}} season. Bennett made a brief return to the S.League in 2002, playing 11 games for Singapore Armed Forces during their title-winning season. He returned to Wrexham in the 2002-03 season. His second spell was more successful, making 21 appearances, including 3 League Cup games as he helped the club win the FAW Premier Cup and clinch promotion to the Second Division. Bennett was offered new terms by Wrexham at the end of the season but chose to reject the contract to return to Singapore to improve his chances of featuring regularly for the national team.|$|R
