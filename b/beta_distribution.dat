40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the task of}} eliciting an informative prior distribution for multinomial models. We first introduce a method of eliciting univariate <b>beta</b> <b>distributions</b> for the probability of each category, conditional on the probabilities of other categories. Two different forms of multivariate prior are derived from the elicited <b>beta</b> <b>distributions.</b> First, we determine the hyperparameters of a Dirichlet distribution by reconciling the assessed parameters of the univariate <b>beta</b> conditional <b>distributions.</b> Although the Dirichlet distribution is the standard conjugate prior distribution for multinomial models, it is not flexible enough to represent {{a broad range of}} prior information. Second, we use the <b>beta</b> <b>distributions</b> to determine the parameters of a Connor–Mosimann distribution, which is a generalization of a Dirichlet distribution and is also a conjugate prior for multinomial models. It has a larger number of parameters than the standard Dirichlet distribution and hence a more flexible structure.

25|$|Several {{different}} distributions {{are sometimes}} referred to as the generalized log-logistic distribution, as they contain the log-logistic as a special case. These include the Burr Type XII distribution (also known as the Singh-Maddala distribution) and the Dagum distribution, both of which include a second shape parameter. Both are in turn special cases of the even more general generalized <b>beta</b> <b>distribution</b> of the second kind. Another more straightforward generalization of the log-logistic is the shifted log-logistic distribution.|$|E
25|$|Several {{different}} forms of logic are used in AI research. Propositional or sentential logic is the logic of statements which can be true or false. First-order logic also allows the use of quantifiers and predicates, and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. Fuzzy logic, is a version of first-order logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1, rather than simply True (1) or False (0). Fuzzy systems {{can be used for}} uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems. Subjective logic models uncertainty in a different and more explicit manner than fuzzy-logic: a given binomial opinion satisfies belief + disbelief + uncertainty = 1 within a <b>Beta</b> <b>distribution.</b> By this method, ignorance can be distinguished from probabilistic statements that an agent makes with high confidence.|$|E
