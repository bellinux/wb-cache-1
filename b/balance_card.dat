40|$|Purpose: This study {{compared}} the near phoria measurement using the Bernell muscle <b>balance</b> <b>card</b> {{with and without}} prism neutralization, using both trial frame and phoropter correction, and compared with the conventional Maddox rod method. Methods: Forty young normal Chinese adults had their near phoria measured with trial frame correction using the conventional muscle <b>balance</b> <b>card</b> method (method 1). Any deviation was compensated with a prism bar as an alternative approach (method 2). The conventional Maddox rod method (method 3) was also carried out for comparison. These three methods were repeated with phoropter correction and considered as methods 4, 5 and 6. Results: The phorias obtained from these six methods {{were not significantly different}} from each other (repeated measures ANOVA, p > 0. 05). More than half of the subjects were exophoric. Although the difference in phoria was not significant, phoria measurement using phoropter correction yielded a greater coefficient of variation. Conclusions: Near phoria measurement using the muscle <b>balance</b> <b>card</b> conducted with trial frame correction was less variable, and was also more natural and similar to a real reading situation. The use of prism for compensation did not affect the phoria results. Exophoria seems to be more common than esophoria in young Chinese adults. School of Optometr...|$|E

In this article we consider multivariate models of credit <b>card</b> <b>balance</b> and use a real dataset of credit card data to test the forecasting performance of the models.

The most important predictor variable is previous lagged balance, but other application and behavioural variables are also found to be important.

The larger the structure, the higher number of <b>balanced</b> <b>cards</b> that could fail and compromise the integrity of the card building. Professional card stacker Bryan Berg claims, however, that the more cards placed on a tower the stronger it becomes, because the weight of the cards pushing down on the base (increasing friction) allows occasional cards to stumble without the entire structure collapsing. He also claims that proper stacking technique allows cards to function as shear walls, giving considerable stability to the structure.|$|R
