5|$|Levodopa and {{proteins}} use {{the same}} transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, thereby competing for access. When they are taken together, {{this results in a}} reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive protein consumption is discouraged and well balanced Mediterranean diet is recommended. In advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa should be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during <b>breakfast</b> <b>and</b> <b>lunch,</b> allowing protein intake in the evening.|$|E

The Dime Store's concept was created by McErlean and Jeremy Larter, and was inspired by the soda shops they both experienced growing up on the East Coast. Prior to the restaurant's opening, plans were to serve <b>breakfast</b> <b>and</b> <b>lunch</b> during mid-week hours, with the potential to later add happy hour and family-friendly dinner options, as well as outdoor seating.|$|E

25|$|The Judsons were {{instrumental}} {{in the development of}} the early infrastructure of Lynden and Whatcom County. At the request of Judson, Holden enlisted the help of the native Nooksack Indians to remove the Little Jam (which they were only too glad to do), working for three months. After the Little Jam was removed, Holden and Phoebe raised $1,500 to hire a contractor, Judge Plaster, to remove the Big Jam, which he completed in 1877. Judson served <b>breakfast</b> <b>and</b> <b>lunch</b> for the Indian workers on both occasions.

25|$|Originally, the country's cuisine {{was shaped}} by the {{practices}} of fishing and farming, including the cultivation of the soil for growing crops and raising domesticated animals. Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward, and contains many dairy products. <b>Breakfast</b> <b>and</b> <b>lunch</b> are typically bread with toppings, with cereal for breakfast as an alternative. Traditionally, dinner consists of potatoes, a portion of meat, and (seasonal) vegetables. The Dutch diet was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat, reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country. Without many refinements, it is best described as rustic, though many holidays are still celebrated with special foods. In {{the course of the}} twentieth century this diet changed and became much more cosmopolitan, with most global cuisines being represented in the major cities.|$|E

25|$|The country's diverse {{religious}} makeup influences its cuisine, as Buddhists avoid {{beef and}} Muslims pork. Beef is considered taboo by devout Buddhists because the cow is highly {{regarded as a}} beast of burden. Vegetarian dishes are only common during the Buddhist Lent (Wa-dwin), a three-month Rains Retreat, as well as Uposatha sabbath days. During this time, only two meals (i.e. <b>breakfast</b> <b>and</b> <b>lunch)</b> are consumed before midday to observe the fasting rules (u bohk saunk) and abstinence from meat (thek that lut, literally 'free of killing') is observed by devout Buddhists. Throughout {{the rest of the}} year, many foods can be prepared vegetarian on request, but the bulk of Burmese food is prepared with fish or meat broth bases. Also, many of the several ethnic groups prepare at least one inherently vegetarian dish (notably cuisine from the Shan people).|$|E
25|$|Muscles and nerves {{that control}} the {{digestive}} process may be affected by PD, so {{it is common to}} experience constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach {{for a longer period of}} time than normal). A balanced diet is recommended to help improve digestion. Diet should include high-fiber foods and plenty of water. Levodopa and proteins use the same transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, competing between them for access. When taken together, the consequences of such competition is a reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive proteins are discouraged, while in advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa is recommended to be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during <b>breakfast</b> <b>and</b> <b>lunch</b> and are usually taken at dinner. As the disease advances, dysphagia may appear. In such cases, specific measures include the use of thickening agents for liquid intake, special postures when eating, and gastrostomy in the worst cases.|$|E
