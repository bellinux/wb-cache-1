25|$|Geronimo {{was raised}} with the {{traditional}} religious views of the Bedonkohe. When questioned about his views on life after death, {{he wrote in his}} 1905 autobiography, As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to what part of man lived after death... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know it.|$|E

As tradition ever since, Arsenal goalkeepers have always washed their jerseys before each game. The Arsenal captain, Buchan, praised the Cardiff team saying [...] "My congratulations to Cardiff City on being the first club in history to take the Cup out of England.

As, however, the trophy is gone to Cardiff, there is no one who more heartily congratualtes them than the captain of the losers. Cardiff played an honest, clean game, each member of the team obviously striving to do his utmost and my final works are Good luck to the City and good luck to Wales and its Association football now that they have the Cup." ...|$|E

500|$|The Dark Blues' {{lead was}} down to half a length {{by the time the}} crews passed Harrods Furniture Depository and by Hammersmith Bridge Cambridge had edged ahead. [...] Still out-rating Oxford, the Light Blues {{gradually}} pulled away and were a length and a half ahead by Chiswick Steps. [...] With no response from Oxford, Cambridge extended their advantage further to around two lengths by Barnes Bridge, a lead which they held at the finishing post in a time of 19 minutes 1 second. [...] They secured their third consecutive victory and their ninth win in eleven years and taking the overall record in the race to 5745 in their favour. [...] At the post-race dinner, held at the Royal Automobile Club in Pall Mall, the Oxford boat club president Carnegie defended his crew's style: [...] "The style was all right <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> match up to it". [...] His counterpart Delahooke suggested that had the race been held ten days prior, Oxford would have won.|$|E
500|$|Sveriges Radio {{stipulated that}} the work had to include a Swedish element. Singer Russell Mael told The National, [...] "At first, we {{obviously}} thought of cars and Ikea. I'm joking. But the more profound, more lasting idea – being the film fans we are – was Ingmar Bergman. So we hit upon a fantasy situation of him going to Hollywood, which is obviously a lot more universal, too." [...] Before starting work on the musical, the Mael brothers decided to refresh their memories by looking at Bergman's films again. [...] "We were both really big film fans in university. At that time unless you only liked foreign film, and hated American ones, you weren't cool", Ron Mael told The Times. [...] "There was a real kind of seriousness to [...] He actually addressed big things {{and was able to}} frame those in really pure, cinematic ways. Now those things are seen as being kind of pretentious. Everyone wants to be seen as though they don't care about the big issues." [...] Commenting on the suitability of Bergman as the topic of a musical, Russell Mael told a Swedish newspaper, [...] "In a way, he is the least appropriate person for a musical. We like the absurdity of it all. He was such a deep, intense person {{and the vast majority of}} his films are about really deep topics. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to ridicule him, we wanted to do something respectful that Bergman would have been able to appreciate." ...|$|E

[...] "Maybe {{he did not know what}} to say. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> receive concrete answers to concrete questions," [...] she said. Tylik told the St. Petersburg Times that she will go to any lengths to learn the truth about the submarine disaster [...] "They told us lies the whole time, and even now we are unable to get any information," [...] she said.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{afterwards}} in November 1942, the Allies launched operation Torch in the west, {{an invasion}} of Vichy-controlled French North Africa. An Anglo-American force of 63,000 men landed in French Morocco and Algeria. The long-term goal was to clear German and Italian troops from North Africa, enhance naval control of the Mediterranean, and prepare {{an invasion of}} Italy in 1943. The Allies had hoped that Vichy forces would offer only token resistance to the Allies, but instead they fought hard, incurring heavy casualties. As a French foreign legionnaire put it after seeing his comrades die in an American bombing raid: [...] "Ever {{since the fall of}} France, we had dreamed of deliverance, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want it that way".|$|E
2500|$|Later, in July, the 4th Brigade {{took part}} in the {{fighting}} around Le Hamel. The tactics used during the battle on 4 July 1918 were conceived by General John Monash and largely carried out by Australian infantrymen, along with a number of US troops. It was the scene of one of Allies greatest military victories during the war. So great was this victory that French prime minister Georges Clemenceau came to address the Australian troops in the field: [...] "When the Australians came to France, the French people expected a great deal of you, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know that from the very beginning you would astonish the whole continent". On 12 August 1918 Monash was knighted in the field by King George V.|$|E

[...] With regard to Wilson's findings, Tenet stated: [...] "Because this report, in our view, did not resolve whether Iraq was or was not seeking uranium from abroad, it was given a normal and wide distribution, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> brief it to the President, Vice-President or other senior Administration officials." ...|$|E
2500|$|Under heavy fire, the US {{infantry}} and dismounted cavalry {{crossed the border}} through the buildings and streets of Nogales, Sonora. Members of the 10th Cavalry advanced through a building in the red-light district of the Mexican border town {{where many of the}} [...] "frightened señoritas" [...] recognized them, according to First Sgt. Thomas Jordan of the 10th Cavalry. Jordan remarked, [...] "I got a laugh when one them spoke to a trooper, saying 'Sergeant Jackson! Are we all glad to see you!' <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have time to tarry for the soldier to alibi his acquaintanceship." [...] As the troops advanced into the city, many of these women ventured out with bedsheets marked with impromptu red crosses in an effort to rescue persons wounded in the fighting. Two of the brave women ignored their own wounds to help rescue their fellow citizens. American civilians and women helped in rescuing the wounded on the American side. One American soldier received an award from the American citizens for his actions in saving noncombatants who had been wounded, despite being wounded himself.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the members {{consider}} Believer a [...] "Christian band" [...] Daub replies {{in an interview with}} Metal Covenant in 2009: [...] "Well, yes, and no... this is a difficult subject to approach for us. Ever since we formed Believer, Kurt Bachman and myself despised being limited to a certain belief or style of music. We did not like to be labeled or numbered. Whether it was our personal spiritual journey, or the type of music we played. We were called thrash, death metal, technical death metal etc. The key focus for us then and now is to just encourage people to think for themselves." [...] Daub comments about the lyrics that [...] "We always wrote about what was near and dear to our heart. On Extraction, we used Bible based themes and stories to express our intentions, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to preach." [...] "Well we never wanted to be known as a Christian band for one [...] It was one of these things where it got out of control. With promoting records {{it was one of those}} things where the record company was like “Hey, here’s a slant. Something different. [...] Something new and unique. Let’s go for that”. I’ve always tried to stay away from labeling the band. For me it’s a band, it’s entertainment. We even get called death metal some times even though I don’t think we resemble anything death metal-ish out there, but then again I have my own opinions on what death metal is. We just don’t want it to be one of those things where someone’s like “oh I hate thrash music, so I won’t like Believer”. You get labeled and we’re going to have to go through labels but we’re not really comfortable with any." [...] says Bachman in an interview on MetalSucks.|$|E
