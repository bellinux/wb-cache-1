5|$|After {{making peace}} with his family, Takanohana regained {{some of his}} {{consistency}} in 2000, although he was temporarily sidelined by an elbow injury suffered in the July tournament. His <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> retired in March, and several {{other members of his}} stable were now past their best. With Akebono dominant once more his best results that year were two runner-up performances.|$|E
5|$|As Emperor, Domitian quickly {{dispensed}} {{with the republican}} facade his father and <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> maintained during their reign. by moving the centre of government (more or less formally) to the imperial court, Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. In his view, the Roman Empire was to be governed as a divine monarchy with himself as the benevolent despot at its head.|$|E

5|$|Roy faced {{challenges}} {{before entering}} college. His parents {{and his older}} <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> not attended college, and due to a learning disability Roy had difficulty with the SAT; his reading comprehension was slow, which increased the time he needed for tests. He had taken the test four times (with tutors) before finally meeting the NCAA requirements. Unsure whether {{he would be able}} to attend a four-year college, Roy worked on the Seattle docks, cleaning shipping containers for $11/hour.|$|E
5|$|While {{working on}} the picture book, Luna {{realized}} he missed telling a story panel by panel and {{decided to return to}} comics. He and his <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> decided to work on separate projects, so Luna pitched the idea of a young man who {{falls in love with a}} female android to Vaughn over dinner.

5|$|Alexander swore {{the oath}} of loyalty to the Greek {{constitution}} {{on the afternoon of}} 11 June 1917 in the ballroom of the Royal Palace. Apart from the Archbishop of Athens, Theocletus I, who administered the oath, only King Constantine I, Crown Prince George and the king's prime minister, Alexandros Zaimis, attended. There were no festivities. The 23-year-old Alexander had a broken voice and tears in his eyes as he made the solemn declaration. He knew that the Entente and the Venizelists would hold real power and that neither his father nor his <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> renounced their claims to the throne. Constantine had informed his son that he should consider himself a regent, rather than a true monarch.|$|E
5|$|Another {{purpose for}} issuing the edict, as {{described}} within the papyrus upon {{which part of}} the edict was inscribed, was to appease the gods who had delivered Caracalla from conspiracy. The conspiracy in question {{was in response to}} Caracalla's murder of Geta and the subsequent slaughter of his followers; fratricide would only have been condoned if his <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> been a tyrant. The damnatio memoriae against Geta and the large payments Caracalla had made to his own supporters were designed to protect himself from possible repercussions. After this had succeeded, Caracalla felt the need to repay the gods of Rome by returning the favour to the people of Rome through a similarly grand gesture. This was done through the granting of citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{attacks the}} house where Breed is staying with the children, and incapacitates the mercenary, leaving him for dead. He {{establishes}} that the children are being used as drug mules to smuggle raw heroin into the country and locates Solomon Adeka, {{who had not been}} killed in Africa, but been turned into a heroin addict in order to control him. Adeka's older <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> been killed in London, ensuring Solomon became chief of the tribe whose lands held massive amounts of oil: as he was an addict, these rights were signed away in favour of Hulbert Linck. Linck was killed by the CIA during the raid on the house.|$|E

5|$|Charles Harmison's older <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> {{moved to}} Romney, where he {{established}} and operated a hotel (the Virginia House). In 1867, the brother {{learned that the}} Parsons farm was for sale, and he advised Charles to buy it. Charles' wife, who wanted to live nearer to Virginia, also urged her husband to buy the property. Charles did, and he, his wife, their (then) seven children and a young African American boy named Snoden moved from Harrison to Hampshire County in three days. They traveled on the Northwestern Turnpike in an ambulance Charles had bought after the war. Influenced by her childhood home and by its view of the South Branch Potomac River valley, Elizabeth Harmison named their new house and farm Valley View.|$|E
5|$|Cosimo did {{not enjoy}} a {{harmonious}} relationship with his elder son, Ferdinando. They disagreed about Cosimo's bigoted ideology and his monthly allowance. Cosimo married him to a Bavarian princess, Violante Beatrice. This union was exceedingly discontent, and produced no offspring. Anna Maria Luisa was the Grand Duke's favourite child. She married Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine, and like her <b>brother,</b> <b>had</b> no issue. Gian Gastone, Cosimo's eventual successor, despised {{his father and his}} court. Anna Maria Luisa arranged for him to marry Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, a union that produced no children.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Hobbits’ fears, Faramir {{was wise}} {{enough to realize that}} such a weapon was not to be used and if desired, should be resisted. With this knowledge, he also {{realized}} what his <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> to face, and wished that he had gone on the quest himself — knowing that Boromir {{would not have been able}} to resist the temptation to seize the Ring for himself. Giving the Hobbits provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest, but warned Frodo that their guide, Gollum, was a treacherous creature, and that an unknown terror lived in Cirith Ungol, where Gollum was leading them.|$|E

5|$|Having {{managed to}} quietly depose their father, the {{brothers}} {{now had to}} deal with Constantine VII. Unfortunately for them, rumours soon spread around Constantinople, to the effect that, following Romanos's deposition, Constantine VII's life was in danger. Before long, crowds gathered before the palace, demanding to see their emperor in person. The contemporary Lombard historian Liutprand of Cremona notes that the ambassadors and envoys from Amalfi, Gaeta, Rome, and Provence present in the capital also supported Constantine VII. Stephen and his <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> to succumb to the inevitable, recognizing their brother-in-law as the senior emperor.|$|E
5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} while we were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When our mother died, it was as though my <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It was a bit much.|$|E
5|$|Louise Nevelson {{was born}} Leah Berliawsky in 1899 in Perislav, Poltava Governorate, Russian Empire, to Minna Sadie and Isaac Berliawsky, a {{contractor}} and lumber merchant. Even though the family lived comfortably, Nevelson's relatives {{had begun to}} leave the Russian Empire for America in the 1880s. The Berliawskys had to stay behind, as Isaac, the youngest <b>brother,</b> <b>had</b> to care for his parents. While still in Europe, Minna gave birth to two of Nevelson's siblings: Nathan (born 1898) and Anita (1902). On his mother's death, Isaac moved to the United States in 1902. After he left, Minna and the children moved to the Kiev area. According to family lore, young Nevelson was so forlorn about her father's departure that she became mute for six months.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, the {{evidence}} suggests that Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> concentrated consular power largely {{in the hands of the}} Flavian family, Domitian admitted a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, allowing them to head the official calendar by opening the year as an ordinary consul. Whether this was a genuine attempt to reconcile with hostile factions in the Senate cannot be ascertained. By offering the consulship to potential opponents, Domitian may have wanted to compromise these senators in the eyes of their supporters. When their conduct proved unsatisfactory, they were almost invariably brought to trial and exiled or executed, and their property was confiscated.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March 1737, penniless, Johnson {{left for}} London {{with his former}} pupil David Garrick. To make things worse, Johnson {{received}} word that his <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> died on the day they left. However, their prospects were not completely hopeless, as Garrick was set to inherit a large sum the next year. Also, Garrick had connections in London, and the two would stay with his distant relative, Richard Norris, who lived on Exeter Street. Johnson did not stay there long, and set out for Greenwich near the Golden Hart Tavern to finish Irene. During that time, he wrote to Cave on 12 July 1737 and proposed a translation for Paolo Sarpi's The History of the Council of Trent (1619), which Cave did not accept until months later.|$|E
5|$|On 7 February 1934, Whittle {{was walking}} through University Park {{when he was}} accosted by a small boy who said that his younger <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> fallen into the lake. Rushing to the area, Whittle dived into the weed-choked lake and began searching for the boy. Finding him unconscious, Whittle brought the boy {{to the bank and}} applied {{artificial}} respiration for approximately half an hour; the child later came around and was taken to hospital. Whittle left the scene and proceeded home in a taxi without leaving his name, but his identity was subsequently discovered and he was presented with a Certificate of Merit by the Royal Life Saving Society. Whittle himself was ill for a fortnight due to swallowing some of the foul water in the ornamental lake.|$|E
