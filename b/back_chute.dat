5000|$|... "Bodacious {{was such}} a {{powerhouse}} it wasn’t uncommon to see his belly {{from the top of}} the <b>back</b> of the <b>chute</b> - and if you can imagine being tied to something nearly a ton dropping even five feet then changing directions - and you don’t know what direction - you can imagine a very small glimpse of him. He was able to buck many off before they could nod their heads." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Rear discharge" [...] trucks {{require both}} a driver and a [...] "chuteman" [...] {{to guide the}} truck and <b>chute</b> <b>back</b> and forth to place {{concrete}} in the manner suitable to the contractor. Newer [...] "front discharge" [...] trucks have controls inside the cab of the truck to allow the driver to move the chute in all directions. The first front discharge mixer was designed and built by Royal W. Sims of Holladay, Utah, United States.|$|R
50|$|The creek {{flows to}} the Colorado River from Beaver Falls. There are {{multiple}} ways {{to reach the}} river, including going <b>back</b> up the <b>chute</b> to the trail and continuing downstream. The 3 mi hike is long, difficult, and rugged, and it is advisable only for experienced hikers. The creek ends at the confluence, where there are some camping areas. This spot is also popular for river rafters to stop and to head up the canyon.|$|R
25|$|Backstage in his post-fight interview, Coleman {{stated that}} the whole melee {{happened}} {{in the heat of}} the moment and that he did not blame the Chute Boxe team for coming in and backing their fighter. He then added that similar to Chute Boxe, Hammer House is also like a family, and thanked Baroni for coming in and watching his <b>back.</b> An outraged <b>Chute</b> Boxe refused to accept Coleman's backstage apology. The Chute Boxe team was assigned a yellow card for instigating this infraction.|$|R
50|$|From {{the main}} parking area, ride Pine Ridge Trail north, then climb the fire {{road to the}} {{beginning}} of Stormy Saddle Trail. ClimbStormy Saddle the top, then descend, crossing the road once about 2/3 of the way down. From the bottom of Stormy Saddle takePine Ridge Trail back to the parking lot, where you'll descend on Tomfoolery to Midslope Road. Turn left on Midslope and climb about half an hour, passing the bottom of Chutes along the way, to Lacks Mountain Trail (look for the campground to your right {{at the top of the}} climb) which you'll want to do counterclockwise, followed by Punchbowl and maybe a quick trip <b>back</b> down <b>Chutes</b> (experts only). Take the road back to either the Jump Trail, the upper section of Tomfoolery or Runaround, all of which end back at the parking area. This ride is about 16 miles in length with over 3,000 feet of climbing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{park has}} many {{amenities}} for various activities, including day use and overnight camping, primitive camp sites, hiking and horse trails, boating, bird watching and a disc golf course.The equestrian trail system and facilities include: {{a very large}} parking area, portable toilets, a covered picnic area, a handicapped mounting ramp, a regular mounting block, an outdoor warm-up arena, a small round pen, and several training stations along the upper trail loop. The stations include: a teeter-totter bridge, a suspension bridge, a farm gate, a <b>back</b> through <b>chute,</b> a [...] "mountain trail" [...] area with small boulders, roots, and logs to step through, two large logs to cross and sidepass, a small water crossing, concrete cavaletti to cross, a two-tiered step-up box, and an 18 by 18 in balance beam, 36 ft long, with a 20-degree bend in the middle. There are also two small bridges over small streams. The park's master plan calls {{for the construction of}} a horse camping area as well.|$|R
50|$|Scroll-bars are {{a result}} of {{continuous}} lateral migration of a meander loop that creates an asymmetrical ridge and swale topography {{on the inside of the}} bends. The topography is generally parallel to the meander, and is related to migrating bar forms and <b>back</b> bar <b>chutes,</b> which carve sediment from the outside of the curve and deposit sediment in the slower flowing water on the inside of the loop, in a process called lateral accretion. Scroll-bar sediments are characterized by cross-bedding and a pattern of fining upward. These characteristics {{are a result}} of the dynamic river system, where larger grains are transported during high energy flood events and then gradually die down, depositing smaller material with time (Batty 2006). Deposits for meandering rivers are generally homogeneous and laterally extensive unlike the more heterogeneous braided river deposits.There are two distinct patterns of scroll-bar depositions; the eddy accretion scroll bar pattern and the point-bar scroll pattern. When looking down the river valley they can be distinguished because the point-bar scroll patterns are convex and the eddy accretion scroll bar patterns are concave. Scroll bars often look lighter at the tops of the ridges and darker in the swales. This is because the tops can be shaped by wind, either adding fine grains or by keeping the area unvegetated, while the darkness in the swales can be attributed to silts and clays washing in during high water periods. This added sediment in addition to water that catches in the swales is in turn is a favorable environment for vegetation that will also accumulate in the swales.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{thought at}} first that I might have done {{something}} wrong the last time," [...] he told me. [...] "But when I watched a video of the ride, {{the fact is that}} I was in perfect position for a bull of that caliber with that bucking pattern. There was nothing I could do. If I’d tried to lean back to avoid his head, I would have been stretched out vertically, and when his back legs hit the ground the force of the downdraft would have jerked me off. That’s why most people really feared him. He was a great bull, but he {{got to the point where}} you could ride him correctly and still nearly get killed." [...] That's why Hedeman climbed on Bodacious' <b>back</b> in the <b>chute.</b> And why, when the gate swung open, Hedeman let the bull explode through it without a rider on his back. Lastly, he tipped his hat to the bull and left the arena. Then, in the 9th round. Scott Breding took his turn and gave Bo his final professional ride.|$|R
50|$|Erwin {{pulled the}} pin and {{released}} a bomb into the chute, but the fuse malfunctioned and ignited the phosphorus prematurely, burning at 1,100 degrees. The canister flew <b>back</b> up the <b>chute</b> and into Erwin's face, blinding him, searing off one ear and obliterating his nose. Smoke immediately filled the aircraft, {{making it impossible}} for the pilot to see his instrument panel. Erwin was afraid the bomb would burn through the metal floor into the bomb bay. Completely blind, he picked it up and feeling his way, crawled around the gun turret and headed for the copilot's window. His face and arms were covered with ignited phosphorus and his path was blocked by the navigator's folding table, hinged to the wall but down and locked. The navigator had left his table to make a sighting. Erwin couldn't release the table's latches with one hand, so he grabbed the white-hot bomb between his bare right arm and his ribcage. In the few seconds it took to raise the table, the phosphorus burned through his flesh to the bone. His body on fire, he stumbled into the cockpit, threw the bomb out the window and collapsed between the pilot's seats.|$|R
5000|$|... "Nobody {{knew the}} bull then." [...] Kish said. When he was 18 years old, Don Kish drew Red Rock at a rodeo in Silver Lake, Oregon. He only lasted a couple jumps before being bucked off {{so hard he}} needed help finding his way <b>back</b> towards the <b>chute.</b> Mert took Red Rock to the World's Toughest Rodeo in Tacoma in 1982. Jody Tatone drew him which started the cowboys talking about him. Red Rock won many awards while he was an amateur bucker. In 1983, Mert was allowed to put Red Rock in the draw for a pro rodeo. Two top pro riders drew him and Red Rock bucked them both off. After that, Mert knew Red Rock could buck at the PRCA level. When Mert {{developed}} terminal cancer in 1984, he contacted John Growney of Growney Brothers Rodeo Company in Red Bluff, California. He was looking for someone special {{to take care of}} Red Rock. Mert had received many offers for Red Rock. However, he had heard that Growney and his partner, Don Kish, had a reputation for taking outstanding care of their livestock. Mert even financed the bull so that the guys could afford to buy him. Growney said Mert would never had sold Red Rock if he hadn't been dying. When Kish and Growney were looking over the stock Mert was selling, they recognized Red Rock immediately and bought him that day in early 1984 for $10,000. Red Rock headed to a new home.|$|R
5000|$|... "When I nodded for him, {{the first}} jump felt fine," [...] he said. [...] "Then, {{all of a}} sudden, whack! When I hit the ground, I felt numb." [...] What Hedeman couldn't see was his appearance, his face had blood all over it. [...] "When I was {{walking out of the}} arena I bit down and my teeth didn't come together, so I figured my jaw was broken," [...] Hedeman recalled. [...] "I didn't realize my whole face was smashed. But when I looked at people looking at me, they looked like they'd seen the devil. [...] "They couldn't find the {{ambulance}} driver, so I sat down and watched the event on TV <b>back</b> behind the <b>chutes</b> for a little while. I told somebody to go tell my wife, Tracy, I was fine so she wouldn't worry. When I got in the ambulance I felt my eyes swelling shut." [...] Upon arriving at the hospital, doctors determined that Bodacious had broken every major bone in Hedeman's face. It took two surgeries, totaling 13 hours, and six titanium plates to reconstruct his face. Hedeman said that when he returned home from the hospital, his head was so swollen he was unrecognizable to his 4-year-old son, Lane. [...] "It damn sure rearranged my face and altered my appearance forever," [...] Hedeman quipped. [...] "But I wasn't real worried about that. If I'd been Clark Gable it might have been different. The good news was I was ugly to begin with, so it really wasn't any great loss." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the living}} room at the Comic Studio, Nermal, Arlene, and Odie notice Garzooka behind them. Garzooka hands them the serums, asking them to help him stop Vetvix. But they don't change {{immediately}} after they drink the serums. However it's time for Odie, Arlene, and Nermal {{to go to work}} and Garzooka follows. Meanwhile, the real Garfield is enjoying a relaxing day all to himself, but is captured by Vetvix (who appeared in Comic Strip World earlier), who threatens him for the Klopman Crystal, but to no avil (because Garfield was a cartoon character). Garfield tried to protect the Klopman Crystal by putting it in his lemonade, and drinks it. But eventually Vetvix's guards get it. Garfield is told by Professor Wally to go over to Emperor Jon and him. He tells Garfield to grab the Professor's lens and puts them on the window. The sunlight burns the Emperor and the professor's ropes. Vetvix order her guards to get rid of Garfield, so they throw Garfield down the garbage <b>chute.</b> <b>Back</b> at Comic Studios, the gang is interrupted by Vetvix, who crashes her war ship into Comic Studios, and zombifies most of the characters at the studio. Nermal, Odie, Arlene, Jon, and Garzooka escape to the back alley. Garzooka is wondering why the serums haven't taken effect yet. He notices Garfield falling from sky. Then Odie, Nermal, and Arlene turn into their Pet Force counterparts. They plan to bring down Vetvix's ship using the antenna on top of a tall tower nearby. Vetvix's ship backs up, causing a bill board to break to pieces. The Pet Force hide under one of the broken pieces of the bill board and escape while being chased by zombies and manage to reach the tower by crashing through walls. Garfield, Jon, and a cartoon trash can are the only ones left in the back alley. Eli saves Garfield from Vetvix, by making the air vent suck him. Jon, however, gets scrambled with the trashcan. Vetvix causes chaos, zombifying all of Cartoon World. Eli scolds Garfield for not helping Garzooka and if haven't been so lazy then Vetvix wouldn't have gotten the Klopman Crystal. Eli and Garfield manage to find three survivors: Wally (Neil Ross), Wally's wife Bonita(Jennifer Darling), and Betty. Garfield decides to name himself and the survivors [...] "The Crazy Crew" [...] and form their own plan. Meanwhile, at the tower, Garzooka realizes the zombies are too much for the Pet Force. Luckily Garfield and Wally disguise themselves as Garzooka (Garfield stands on top of Wally to make the fake Garzooka taller)) and get the zombies attention. The real Garzooka and the Pet Force go to the antenna and use it to bring down Vetvix's ship. Meanwhile, the zombies chase Garfield and Wally to the Comic Studio, and Eil opens the pit in the filming area, in which the zombies fall into. Meanwhile, at the tower, Vetvix shoots the Moscram Ray Gun, using the super scramble mode, combining all the Pet Force members into one creature. However, they move in different direction, and they fall off the tower.|$|R
