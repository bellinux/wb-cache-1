Two kinds of TBCs with different thicknesses of approximately 80 and 280 µm in <b>bond</b> <b>layer</b> were prepared by two different methods of air plasma spray (APS) and high velocity oxygen flow (HVOF).

The effects of the heated water environments on the adhesive <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> between the CFRP and concrete beams were evaluated by quantifying: (1) the changes of delaminations within the adhesive <b>bonding</b> <b>layer,</b> (2) the changes in resistance to direct shear force and (3) the changes of failure mode distribution. Before the exposure, the condition of the adhesive <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> was inspected by infrared thermography (IRT). After exposure, the deterioration of the same <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> and failure mode distributions were measured by analyzing the visual photos on the failed CFRP strips.

40|$|AbstractThe {{engineering}} ceramic {{grinding process}} with an electroplated diamond wheel is significantly {{influenced by the}} detrimental effect of the grain dislodgement which causes surface roughness degradation and tool life decrease. Therefore, {{the thickness of the}} electroplated <b>bond</b> <b>layer</b> must be large enough to provide sufficient micro-bonding force to overcome the single grain micro-cutting force during grinding. However, large electroplated <b>bond</b> <b>layer</b> thickness hampers the protrusion condition of the grains, and causes insufficient active grains. The conventional „trial and error‟ method based on heuristic knowledge currently appears to be the only way in developing electroplated diamond wheels. The difficulty of a deterministic wheel design lies in the lack of an integrated model to predict micro-bonding force and the protrusion conditions of all diamond grains on the wheel surface for given a grain size, dimensional distribution, and <b>bond</b> <b>layer</b> thickness. In this paper, the digital grinding wheel model is developed for single layer electroplated diamond wheels by simulating each wheel fabrication procedure numerically. The model provides a 3 D view of the wheel surface condition and micro-bonding force, protrusion information in correlation with the wheel design parameters, e. g. grain size, dimensional distribution and <b>bond</b> <b>layer</b> thickness. Based on the analysis of the micro-cutting force on a single grain during grinding, the optimal electroplated <b>bond</b> <b>layer</b> thickness can be determined. Finally, a grinding experiment for an alumina engineering ceramic is carried out to verify the efficacy of the model in the development of dislodgement free diamond wheels...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{electromechanical}} impedance (EMI) {{technique for}} structural health monitoring (SHM) and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) employs piezoelectric-ceramic (PZT) patches, which are surface bonded to the monitored structures using adhesives. The adhesive forms a finitely thick, permanent interfacial layer between the host {{structure and the}} patch. Hence, the force transmission between the structure and the patch occurs through the <b>bond</b> <b>layer,</b> via shear mechanism, invariably causing shear lag. However, the impedance models developed so far ignore the associated shear lag and idealize the force transfer to occur {{at the ends of}} the patch. This paper analyses the mechanism of force transfer through the <b>bond</b> <b>layer</b> and presents a step-by-step derivation to integrate the shear lag effect into impedance formulations, both one-dimensional and two-dimensional. Further, using the integrated model, the influence of various parameters (associated with the <b>bond</b> <b>layer)</b> on the electromechanical admittance response is studied by means of a parametric study. It is found that the <b>bond</b> <b>layer</b> can significantly modify the measured electromechanical admittance if not carefully controlled during the installation of the PZT patch.

40|$|The {{compensation}} of {{the degradation of}} the <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> of piezoceramics used in structural health monitoring is addressed in this article. A simple admittance model is first used to measure and extract the variation of admittance parameters using the same acquisition chain which {{is used by the}} structural health monitoring system for damage monitoring. More precisely, the method uses measurable changes in physical transducer modal damping at frequencies around piezoceramic resonance to estimate the extent of degradation. Then, a finite element model is used to obtain calibration curves linking the variations in transducer modal damping to amplitude and phase of the ultrasonic signals generated or measured by the piezoceramics. Such calibration curves are obtained by simulating with the FEM the effect of varying the <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> coverage area and Young's modulus on (a) admittance and (b) amplitude and phase of the ultrasonic signals. From this, a signal correction factor is developed for the dominant <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> coverage area degradation failure mode to compensate for the changes in amplitude and phase of guided waves generated and measured by degraded piezoceramic transducers. The measured modal damping determines the amount of <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> degradation from the simulated modal damping calibration curves and then the quantified <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> degradation amount selects the amplitude and phase correction to be applied to measured signals from the calibration curves. The benefits of the signal correction factor are demonstrated below piezoceramic resonance to improve damage imaging and localization using the Embedded Ultrasonic Structural Radar algorithm (delay and sum method) when a single transducer in a sparse array of transducers fixed to an aluminum plate is damaged due to the close proximity of drop-weight impacts. Up to a certain damage extent, the signal correction factor could allow an extension of the service life of the structural health monitoring system. 9 The Author(s) 2013.

40|$|High {{temperature}} steam electrolysis is {{an efficient}} process and a promising technology to convert electricity and steam or {{a mixture of}} steam and CO₂, into H₂ or syn-gas (H₂ 2 + CO) respectively. It is carried out in Solid Oxide Electrolytic Cells (SOECs). At the high temperature of operation, above 8000 [degree] C, loss {{in the rate of}} hydrogen (or syn gas) production by SOECs has been observed. This loss of performance has been a scientific and technological challenge. The goal of this thesis is to identify the mechanisms for the loss in the electrochemical performance of SOECs due to the oxygen electrode and <b>bond</b> <b>layer</b> degradation. Our specific research objectives were focused on two main mechanisms: 1) Cr transport into the oxygen electrode and <b>bond</b> <b>layer,</b> and 2) Long-range segregation of cations in the <b>bond</b> <b>layer.</b> For SOECs provided by Ceramatec Inc. for this analysis, La₀. ₈Sr₀. ₂CoO₃ (LSC) was the <b>bond</b> <b>layer</b> and A₀. ₈Sr₀. ₂MnO₃ (ASM*) was the oxygen electrode, both comprised of perovskite structure. The approach in thesis integrated complementary spectroscopy and microscopy techniques in a novel manner to carry out the 'post-mortem' analysis of SOECs from a high level to a high resolution. Raman spectroscopy was employed to identify secondary phases on the top surface of LSC near the interconnect interphase. Surface chemistry and microstructure of the air electrode and the <b>bond</b> <b>layer</b> was studied using scanning Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) with nano-probe capability. (cont.) High-resolution analysis of the cation distribution in the bulk of the LSC <b>bond</b> <b>layer</b> was achieved by employing Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDX) coupled with Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM). Electrochemical treatment and characterization was performed to isolate the mechanism(s) governing the long-range segregation of cations, leading to the dissociation of the LSC <b>bond</b> <b>layer.</b> Less-conducting, secondary phases of Cr₂O₃, LaCrO₃, La₂CrO₆ and Co₃ 0 ₄ were identified on the top surface of LSC <b>bond</b> <b>layer.</b> The <b>bond</b> <b>layer</b> exhibited: 1) presence of Cr, with average Cr-fraction of approximately 0. 07 at the surface of its grains, and 2) surface composition variation locally, with La/Co ranging widely from 0. 67 to 16. 37 compared to the stoichiometric La/Co value of 0. 8. Sr and Co cations migrated from the <b>bond</b> <b>layer</b> structure to the LSC/interconnect interface, over a distance of 10 - 20 microns. Furthermore, STEM/EDX results showed the presence of phase separated regions at the nano-scale rich in Cr and La but lacking Co, and vice-versa. This indicates the dissociation of <b>bond</b> <b>layer</b> bulk structure at nano-scale. Cr fraction in LSC bulk varied from 10 to 33 %, which is higher than the average Cr-content at the surface of LSC grains. The maximum Sr fraction observed in LSC bulk was 4. 16 %, confirming the migration of Sr to LSC/interconnect interface. (cont.) We hypothesize that the long-range transport of Sr, Co, and Cr cations can be caused by two primary mechanisms: 1) Driven by Cr-related thermodynamics, where the Crcontaning species (i. e. at the vicinity of the interconnect) could thermodynamically favor the presence of select cations (i. e. Sr and Co) at the region interfacing the interconnect. 2) Driven by the electronic or oxygen ion current. To test these hypotheses and to isolate the governing mechanism, we simulated controlled electrochemical conditions on reference cells having ASM electrodes coated with LSC, on both sides of SSZ electrolyte, without any Cr-containing layers on the LSC <b>bond</b> <b>layer.</b> The reference cells degraded {{even in the absence of}} Cr. AES results showed that the microstructure and surface composition of the reference cells stayed stable and uniform upon the electrochemical treatment, in spite of the degradation. Thus, this thesis concludes that the Cr-related thermodynamics could be the dominant mechanism driving the uneven dissociation and segregation of cations in LSC as observed in the stack cells. As a mechanism for Cr-deposition in the LSC <b>bond</b> <b>layer,</b> we suggest that a thermodynamically-favored reaction between the La-enriched phase (at the surface of the LSC grains) and the volatile Cr-species (Cr 0 ₃ and CrO₂(OH)) is responsible for the formation of poorly-conducting secondary phases. This interaction is likely to be limited by the presence of the segregated La-O-species which can serve as a nucleation agent for this reaction. by Vivek Inder Sharma. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|AbstractSome {{composite}} materials are constructed of two dissimilar half-planes bonded by a nonhomogeneous elastic layer. In the present study, a crack is {{situated at the}} interface between the upper half-plane and the <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> of such a material, and another crack {{is located at the}} interface between the lower half-plane and the <b>bonding</b> <b>layer.</b> The material properties of the <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> vary continuously from those of the lower half-plane to those of the upper half-plane. Incoming shock stress waves impinge upon the two interface cracks normal to their surfaces. Fourier transformations were used to reduce the boundary conditions for the cracks to two pairs of dual integral equations in the Laplace domain. To solve these equations, the differences in the crack surface displacements were expanded in a series of functions that are zero-valued outside the cracks. The unknown coefficients in the series were solved using the Schmidt method so as to satisfy the conditions inside the cracks. The stress intensity factors were defined in the Laplace domain and were inverted numerically to physical space. Dynamic stress intensity factors were calculated numerically for selected crack configurations...|$|E
40|$|Methods for {{non-destructive}} inspection of layered materials {{are becoming more}} and more popular as a way of assuring product integrity and quality. In this paper, we present a model-based technique using ultrasonic measurements for classification of thin bonding layers within three-layered materials. This could be, for example, an adhesive bond between two thin plates, where the integrity of the <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> needs to be evaluated. The method is based on a model of the wave propagation of pulse-echo ultrasound that first reduces the measured data to a few parameters for each measured point. The model parameters are then fed into a statistical classifier that assigns the <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> to one of a set of predefined classes. In this paper, two glass plates are bonded together with construction silicone, and the classifiers are trained to determine if the <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> is intact or if it contains regions of air or water. Two different classification methods are evaluated: nominal logistic regression and discriminant analysis. The former is slightly more computationally demanding but, as the results show, it performs better when the model parameters cannot be assumed to belong to a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The performance of the classifiers is evaluated using both simulations and real measurements. Validerad; 2010; Bibliografisk uppgift: Paper ID: 015701; 20090710 (johanc...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} bonding on the {{performance}} of UHF-rang ultrasonic transducer which radiates acoustic waves into the solid medium are analyzed. By appling the conventional transmission line theory, the <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> interposed between the transducer and the solid acoustic medium may be considered. And the influence of bonding thickness and its materials upon the insertion loss and the bandwidth is examined. 　Consequently, it is found that this <b>bonding</b> <b>layer</b> acts a mechanical transformer causing a larger mechanical load to match the transducer, namely, as a quarter wave matching circuit. In the low-coupling transducer as a quartz crystal, however, the calculated results show that the bandwidth decreases by the mechaical quarter wave matching as the insertion loss does and that an increase in the bandwidth is expected as the electric driving source impedance increases...|$|E
40|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} of Al 2 O 3 –ZrO 2 were prepared by air plasma spraying {{on the surface}} of 20 G steel. Phase constitution, microstructures and elemental distributions of the coatings were studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and electron probe X-ray microanalysis. The results show that the plasma spray coating mainly consists of α-Al 2 O 3, c-ZrO 2, and t-ZrO 2. The bond state of the interface between the top <b>layer</b> and <b>bond</b> <b>layer</b> is fine, and the <b>bond</b> <b>layer</b> has a good combination with the substrate. ZrO 2 and Al 2 O 3 structures can closely integrate together and form compact top layer system. Plasma spraying, thermal {{barrier coatings}}, alumina, zirconia–yttria, microstructure...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} {{fractional}} time steps and splitting of operators {{has been used}} to obtain a numerical {{solution to the problem of}} transient heat transfer in a three-dimensional, anisotropic, composite rectangular slab. Heat transfer is coupled with thermal expansion, the latter changing the shape and size of the composite slab. The composite slab could be a laminated composite or may consist of several <b>layered</b> slabs <b>bonded</b> together. The bonding could be perfect or imperfect. Numerical results have been presented for the moving boundaries and transient temperatures for two <b>bonded,</b> <b>layered</b> slabs. With some minor changes, any number of <b>bonded,</b> <b>layered</b> slabs can be considered, and their volume fractions can be varied as desired...|$|R
40|$|With an {{increasing}} use of adhesively bonded joints in the industry, there is a correspondingly growing need for the inspection of adhered joints. It is necessary to detect defects in the adhesively bonded materials such as voids inclusions, chemical miscure of the adhesive, or delaminations of the <b>bonded</b> <b>layers.</b> In order to use an ultrasonic technique to detect these defects, {{a thorough understanding of}} the wave propagation and wave interaction with the adhesive layer must exist. The paper presents the testing and modeling of guided Lamb waves for disbond detection in adhesively <b>bonded</b> <b>layered</b> media using piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS). The interaction of the Lamb waves with the <b>bonded</b> <b>layer</b> was studied. An aluminum lap joint specimen was created and artificial disbonds were introduced in the structure. The guided Lamb waves were generated and introduced in the specimen using PWAS. The dispersion and attenuation of the traveling waves was studied for two cases, across the bond-line and along the bond-line. The focus was on the A 0 and S 0 modes of the guided Lamb waves. The two methods used in the experiment are pitch-catch (across the bond-line), and the pulse echo (along the bond-line) ...|$|R
