5000|$|... 1894 — <b>Baryta</b> <b>layer</b> {{added to}} {{commercial}} gelatin DOP manufacture ...|$|E
50|$|The second {{layer is}} the baryta, a white opaque coating made {{primarily}} from gelatin and barium sulfate. Its {{purpose is to}} cover the paper fibers and form a smooth surface upon which to coat the gelatin. Surface textures are created {{by a variety of}} textured felts used in the drying of the paper, calendaring, and embossing before or after application of the <b>baryta</b> <b>layer</b> depending on the desired effect.|$|E
50|$|Although the <b>baryta</b> <b>layer</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} part in the manufacture of smooth and glossy prints, the baryta paper of the 1890s did not produce the lustrous or glossy print surface that became the standard for fine art photography in the twentieth century. Matting agents, textured papers, and thin baryta layers that were not heavily calendered produced a low-gloss and textured appearance. The higher gloss papers first became popular in the 1920s and 30s as photography transitioned from pictorialism into modernism, photojournalism, and “straight” photography.|$|E
50|$|The gelatin silver {{print or}} gelatin {{developing}} out paper (DOP) is a monochrome imaging process {{based on the}} light sensitivity of silver halides. They have been made for both contact printing and enlarging purposes by modifying the paper’s light sensitivity. A brief exposure to a negative produces a latent image, which is then made visible by a developing agent. The image is then made permanent by treatment in a photographic fixer, which removes the remaining light sensitive silver halides. And finally, a water bath clears the fixer from the print. The final image consists of small particles of silver bound in a layer of gelatin. This gelatin image layer {{is only one of}} the four layers found in a typical gelatin silver print, which typically include the overcoat, image <b>layer,</b> <b>baryta,</b> and paper support.|$|R
50|$|A {{thin layer}} of barium sulfate called baryta is first coated on the base surface of most {{photographic}} paper to increase the reflectiveness of the image, with the first such paper introduced in 1884 in Germany. The light-sensitive silver halide emulsion is then coated over the <b>baryta</b> <b>layer.</b> The baryta coating limits the penetration of the emulsion into the fibers of the paper and makes the emulsion more even, resulting in more uniform blacks. (Further coatings may then be present for fixing and protection of the image.) More recently, baryta {{has been used to}} brighten papers intended for ink-jet printing.|$|E
50|$|Gelatin silver print {{paper was}} made {{as early as}} 1874 on a {{commercial}} basis, but it was poor quality because the dry-plate emulsion was coated onto the paper only as an afterthought. Coating machines {{for the production of}} continuous rolls of sensitized paper were in use by the mid-1880s, though widespread adoption of gelatin silver print materials did not occur until the 1890s. The earliest papers had no <b>baryta</b> <b>layer,</b> and {{it was not until the}} 1890s that baryta coating became a commercial operation, first in Germany, in 1894, and then taken up by Kodak by 1900.|$|E
5000|$|The term baryta {{derives from}} {{the name of a}} common barium sulfate-containing mineral, barite. However, the {{substance}} used to coat photographic papers is usually not pure barium sulfate, but a mixture of barium and strontium sulfates. The ratio of strontium to barium differs among commercial photographic papers, so chemical analysis can be used to identify the maker of the paper used to make a print and sometimes when the paper was made. [...] The <b>baryta</b> <b>layer</b> has two functions 1) to brighten the image and 2) to prevent chemicals adsorbed on the fibers from infiltrating the gelatin layer. The brightening occurs because barium sulfate {{is in the form of}} a fine precipitate that scatters light back through the silver image layer. In the early days of photography, before baryta layers were used, impurities from the paper fibers could gradually diffuse into the silver layer and cause an uneven loss of sensitivity (before development) or mottle (unevenly discoluor) the silver image (after development).|$|E
