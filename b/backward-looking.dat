5|$|Keynesians and monetarists {{recognized}} that people based their economic decisions on {{expectations about the}} future. However, until the 1970s, most models relied on adaptive expectations, which assumed that expectations were based on an average of past trends. For example, if inflation averaged 4% over a period, economic agents were assumed to expect 4% inflation the following year. In 1972 Lucas, influenced by a 1961 agricultural economics paper by John Muth, introduced rational expectations to macroeconomics. Essentially, adaptive expectations modeled behavior {{as if it were}} <b>backward-looking</b> while rational expectations modeled economic agents (consumers, producers and investors) who were forward-looking. New classical economists also claimed that an economic model would be internally inconsistent if it assumed that the agents it models behave as if they were unaware of the model. Under the assumption of rational expectations, models assume agents make predictions based on the optimal forecasts of the model itself. This did not imply that people have perfect foresight, but that they act with an informed understanding of economic theory and policy.|$|E

25|$|A {{prospective}} study is forward-looking and includes subjects {{who did not}} originally have symptoms of the disease being studied. Many retrospective, or <b>backward-looking,</b> studies might take a group of alcoholics and try to determine what common traits might have caused their alcoholism. A {{prospective study}} takes a group of healthy individuals and tries to predict which ones would become alcoholic based on their histories—a much broader technique that often yields surprising results.|$|E
25|$|These occurrences {{led to the}} {{founding}} of the Voluntary Academic Society of Basel (Freiwillige Akademische Gesellschaft) in 1835, which began supporting the collections in financial terms and through purchases and gifts as part of its general promotion of the university. Yet the greatest momentum for the museum building came from natural science circles centered on the physics and chemistry professor Peter Merian, who was likely responsible for securing a dedicated annual budget for the Natural History Museum – the only state collection with this distinction. A combination of academic institution, library and laboratories, the establishment of the Natural History Museum at the Falkensteiner Hof also provided a model for the museum building. The fact that a primary museum building was ultimately created instead of a university-affiliated building was due to the university’s poor standing among wide sections of the merchant and industrialist classes. In these sectors, the university was considered a <b>backward-looking</b> institution. The museum, by contrast, was seen as a driving force for practical popular education and the community was willing to support its construction with private contributions as part of a wider process of renewal in the city.|$|E
500|$|Historically this square {{was used}} for public decapitations by rulers who sought to {{maintain}} their power by frightening the public. The square attracted dwellers from the surrounding desert and mountains to trade here, and stalls were raised in the square from early in its history. The square attracted tradesmen, snake charmers ("wild, dark, frenzied men with long disheveled hair falling over their naked shoulders"), dancing boys of the Chleuh Atlas tribe, and musicians playing pipes, tambourines and African drums. Richard Hamilton said that Jemaa el-Fnaa once [...] "reeked of Berber particularism, of <b>backward-looking,</b> ill-educated countrymen, rather than the reformist, pan-Arab internationalism and command economy that were the imagined future." [...] Today the square attracts people from a diversity of social and ethnic backgrounds and tourists {{from all around the}} world. Snake charmers, acrobats, magicians, mystics, musicians, monkey trainers, herb sellers, story-tellers, dentists, pickpockets, and entertainers in medieval garb still populate the square.|$|E
500|$|Three {{proposals}} for minority representation in Parliament {{had been considered}} by a 1966 Constitutional Commission chaired by the Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin. The first {{was to have a}} committee of representatives of minorities that would elect three persons from amongst its members to represent minorities in Parliament. However, this was rejected as the Commission felt that it would be an inappropriate and retrogressive move in that unelected members {{should not be allowed to}} dilute the elected chamber. The second proposal, which was to have proportional representation, was also rejected on the grounds that it would intensify party politics along racial lines and eventually [...] "perpetuate and accentuate racial differences". This would then make it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to achieve a single homogeneous community out of the many races that form the population of the Republic. The third proposal was to have an upper house in Parliament composed of members elected or nominated to represent the racial, linguistic and religious minorities in Singapore. However, this was rejected as being <b>backward-looking</b> since politicians should attain a seat in Parliament through taking part in elections.|$|E
500|$|John Howard becomes {{leader of}} the Opposition, {{presenting}} a new threat to Keating. [...] Howard describes his intense desire for power and his thirst for revenge against the petty humiliations put on him {{as a child in}} a menacing minor-key march ("Power"). [...] However, in the media he presents himself as [...] "a normal bloke and nothing more" [...] ("The Mateship"). [...] Through various costume changes, he attempts to cast himself as a sports fan, a friend of the Australian soldier and a farmer, though the song implies that these are only costumes. [...] The song also refers to the [...] "children overboard" [...] affair, his criticism of political correctness, and his use of immigration as a political issue, some of which occurred after the actual Howard's subsequent election to Prime Minister. [...] In a slow rock duet, Keating and Howard both beseech voters to [...] "Choose Me". [...] However, as the 1996 electoral polls close, Keating concludes that he is doomed electorally. [...] He sings of his unachieved dreams and with some bitterness at what he sees as the <b>backward-looking</b> message of his opponent in a country-influenced ballad referring to former Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley's description of Labor's overarching goals ("The Light On The Hill").|$|E
2500|$|Until the 1980s, Strauss was {{regarded}} by some post-modern musicologists as a conservative, <b>backward-looking</b> composer, but re-examination of and new {{research on the}} composer has re-evaluated his place {{as that of a}} modernist, albeit one who still utilized and sometimes revered tonality and lush orchestration. Strauss is noted for his pioneering subtleties of orchestration, combined with an advanced harmonic style; when he first played Strauss at a university production of Ariadne auf Naxos, the conductor Mark Elder [...] "was flabbergasted. I had no idea music could do the things he was doing with harmony and melody." ...|$|E
2500|$|Churchill himself seems, {{in a long}} life, to {{have written}} about Black Dog on one {{occasion}} only: the reference, a <b>backward-looking</b> one, occurs in a private handwritten letter to Clementine Churchill dated July 1911 which reports the successful treatment of a relative's depression by a doctor in Germany. His ministerial circumstances at that date, the very limited treatments available for serious depression pre-1911, {{the fact of the}} relative's being [...] "complete cured", and, not least, the evident deep interest Churchill took in the fact of the complete cure, can be shown to point to Churchill's pre-1911 Black Dog depression's having been a form of mild (i.e. non-psychotic) anxiety-depression, as that term is defined by Professor Edward Shorter.|$|E
2500|$|Rore {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} composers in the middle of the sixteenth century, mainly through the dissemination of his madrigals. [...] His 1542 book was an extraordinary event, and recognized as such at the time: [...] it established five voices as the norm, rather than four, and it married the polyphonic texture of the Netherlandish motet with the Italian secular form, bringing a seriousness of tone which was to become one of the predominant trends in madrigal composition all the way into the seventeenth century. [...] All of the lines of development in the madrigal in the late century can be traced to ideas first seen in Rore; according to Alfred Einstein, his only true spiritual successor was Claudio Monteverdi, another revolutionary. [...] In his sacred music, however, Rore was more <b>backward-looking,</b> showing his connection to his Netherlandish roots: [...] his masses, for example, are reminiscent of the work of Josquin des Prez.|$|E
2500|$|Hosking's work at Abney Park won {{important}} admirers, {{as well as}} critics. Its {{combination of}} an architectural design approach, academically researched in every detail, conceptual empathy for the non-denominational idea, and educational landscape complete with arboretum, presented the environs of London with a challenging standard for future landscape and building design. In 1840, in recognition of Hosking's contribution {{to the advancement of}} architectural practice, he was offered the first Professorship of King's College in the [...] "Art of Construction", soon renamed [...] "Principles and Practice of Architecture", to better reflect this relatively new profession and its emergence as an academic discipline. Hosking's educational approach was set out in his new book of the same title, Principles and Practice of Architecture (1842). His appointment by King's College was something of a coup for those with liberal, non-denominational empathies, since the university was founded as a high church riposte against the [...] "ungodly" [...] UCL with its non-denominational entry requirements. King's was only brought slowly out of this <b>backward-looking</b> denominational approach that gradually came to be perceived as belonging to a bygone age.|$|E
2500|$|His own memoirs, {{appearing}} in book form {{and in other}} formats, were treasured by the reading public, and were featured in Romanian Radio broadcasts. As noted by Eftimiu, they conserved the universe of the more senior readers, who bought the books to regain contact with the prewar world. Writing in 1931, Isac also saluted in them {{the return of the}} old 1890s poet, who, although [...] "belated", offered [...] "a compendium of civilization, affection, and true Romanianism." [...] Rosetti himself was avowedly <b>backward-looking</b> and uninterested in modernist literature. In a 1935 interview with Mihail Sebastian of Rampa, Rosetti argued that Dada and Futurism were [...] "here today, gone tomorrow", declaring that he only read works by his own generation colleagues. He continued to causes other than cremation. Prior to the election of 1931, he represented Averescu in a civil lawsuit against journalist Bazil Gruia, who had referred to the general as an [...] "assassin of the peasants". Although, as he noted, he regarded himself as Averescu's political adversary, he agreed to defend the [...] "great commander who had led our troops to victory".|$|E
2500|$|Li Bai had {{a strong}} sense of himself as being part of a poetic tradition. The [...] "genius" [...] of Li Bai, says one recent account, [...] "lies at once in his total command of the {{literary}} tradition before him and his ingenuity in bending (without breaking) it to discover a uniquely personal idiom...." [...] Burton Watson, comparing him to Du Fu, says Li's poetry, [...] "is essentially <b>backward-looking,</b> that it represents more a revival and fulfillment of past promises and glory than a foray into the future." [...] Watson adds, as evidence, that of all the poems attributed to Li Bai, about one sixth are in the form of yuefu, or, in other words, reworked lyrics from traditional folk ballads. As further evidence, Watson cites the existence of a fifty-nine poem collection by Li Bai entitled Gu Feng, or In the Old Manner, [...] which is, in part, tribute to the poetry of the Han and Wei dynasties. His admiration for certain particular poets is also shown through specific allusions, for example to Qu Yuan or Tao Yuanming, and occasionally by name, for example Du Fu.|$|E
2500|$|In 1945, he {{was invited}} to set up a {{counseling}} center at the University of Chicago. In 1947 he was elected President of the American Psychological Association. While {{a professor of psychology at}} the University of Chicago (1945–57), Rogers helped to establish a counseling center connected with the university and there conducted studies to determine the effectiveness of his methods. His findings and theories appeared in Client-Centered Therapy (1951) and Psychotherapy and Personality Change (1954). One of his graduate students at the University of Chicago, Thomas Gordon, established the Parent Effectiveness Training (P.E.T.) movement. [...] Another student, Eugene T. Gendlin, who was getting his Ph.D. in philosophy, developed the practice of Focusing based on Rogerian listening. [...] In 1956, Rogers became the first President of the American Academy of Psychotherapists. He taught psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (1957–63), during which time he wrote one of his best-known books, On Becoming a Person (1961). Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow (1908–70) pioneered a movement called humanistic psychology which reached its peak in the 1960s. In 1961, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Carl Rogers was also one of the people who questioned the rise of McCarthyism in 1950s. Through articles, he criticized society for its <b>backward-looking</b> affinities.|$|E
2500|$|The end of {{the decade}} brought {{professional}} setbacks for Brahms. The premiere of the First Piano Concerto in Hamburg on 22 January 1859, with the composer as soloist, was poorly received. Brahms wrote to Joachim that the performance was [...] "a brilliant and decisive – failure...t forces one to concentrate one's thoughts and increases one's courage...But the hissing {{was too much of a}} good thing..." [...] At a second performance, audience reaction was so hostile that Brahms had to be restrained from leaving the stage after the first movement. As a consequence of these reactions Breitkopf and Härtel declined to take on his new compositions. Brahms consequently established a relationship with other publishers, including Simrock, who eventually became his major publishing partner. Brahms further made an intervention in 1860 in the debate on the future of German music which seriously misfired. Together with Joachim and others, he prepared an attack on Liszt's followers, the so-called [...] "New German School" [...] (although Brahms himself was sympathetic to the music of Richard Wagner, the School's leading light). In particular they objected to the rejection of traditional musical forms and to the [...] "rank, miserable weeds growing from Liszt-like fantasias". A draft was leaked to the press, and the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik published a parody which ridiculed Brahms and his associates as <b>backward-looking.</b> Brahms never again ventured into public musical polemics.|$|E
2500|$|While Meyerbeer's {{popularity}} has faded, {{the fortunes of}} another French composer of the era have risen steeply {{over the past few}} decades. Yet the operas of Hector Berlioz were failures in their day. Berlioz was a unique mixture of an innovative modernist and a <b>backward-looking</b> conservative. His taste in opera had been formed in the 1820s, when the works of Gluck and his followers were being pushed aside in favour of Rossinian bel canto. Though Berlioz grudgingly admired some works by Rossini, he despised what he saw as the showy effects of the Italian style and longed to return opera to the dramatic truth of Gluck. He was also a fully-fledged Romantic, keen to find new ways of musical expression. His first and only work for the Paris Opéra, Benvenuto Cellini (1838), was a notorious failure. Audiences could not understand the opera's originality and musicians found its unconventional rhythms impossible to play. Twenty years later, Berlioz began writing his operatic masterpiece Les Troyens with himself rather than audiences of the day in mind. Les Troyens was to be the culmination of the French Classical tradition of Gluck and Spontini. Predictably, it failed to make the stage, at least in its complete, four-hour form. For that, it would {{have to wait until the}} second half of the twentieth century, fulfilling the composer's prophecy, [...] "If only I could live till I am a hundred and forty, my life would become decidedly interesting". Berlioz's third and final opera, the Shakespearean comedy Béatrice et Bénédict (1862), was written for a theatre in Germany, where audiences were far more appreciative of his musical innovation.|$|E
