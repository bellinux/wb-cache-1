25|$|In 1971, Susan Breakefield sued {{to recover}} {{three years of}} income taxes she paid to the District of Columbia <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> she {{was a victim of}} {{taxation}} without representation.

25|$|A month earlier, President of Defend International {{dedicated}} her 2014 International Pfeffer Peace Award to the Yazidis, Christians and {{all residents}} of Kobane <b>because,</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> {{facts on the}} ground demonstrate that these peaceful people are not safe in their enclaves, partly because of their ethnic origin and/or religion and they are therefore in urgent need for immediate attention from the global community. She asked the international community {{to make sure that the}} victims are not forgotten; they should be rescued, protected, fully assisted and compensated fairly.|$|E
25|$|When Hayworth and Dick Haymes first met, he {{was still}} married and his singing career was waning. When she {{showed up at the}} clubs, he got a larger audience. Haymes was desperate for money, because two of his former wives were taking legal action against him for unpaid child support. His {{financial}} problems were so bad, he could not return to California without being arrested. On July 7, 1954, his ex-wife Nora Haymes got a bench warrant for his arrest, because he owed her $3,800 in alimony. Less than a week earlier, his other ex-wife, Joanne Dru, also got a bench warrant <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> he owed $4,800 in support payments for their three children. Hayworth ended up paying most of Haymes's debts.|$|E
50|$|Umm Jamil {{is called}} “the bearer of the wood” <b>because</b> <b>she</b> is <b>said</b> to have carried thorns and cast them in Muhammad's pathway. Being a next-door {{neighbor}} to Muḥammad, she also threw garbage {{over the wall}} into Muhammad's house.|$|R

6000|$|But Miss Triscoe {{refused the}} bait, either <b>because</b> <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> all <b>she</b> meant, or <b>because</b> <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> all <b>she</b> would, about Chicago, which Mrs. March {{felt for the}} present to be one with Burnamy. She gave another of her leaps. [...] "I don't see why people are so anxious to get it like Europe, at home. They {{say that there was}} a time when there were no chaperons before hoops, you know." [...] She looked suggestively at Mrs. March, resting one slim hand on the table, and {{controlling}} her skirt with the other, as if she were getting ready to rise at any moment. [...] "When they used to sit on their steps." ...|$|R
25|$|Sarah Dozier, Johnston's niece, filed {{a motion}} asking a federal judge for {{sanctions}} against the city of Atlanta <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> it had withheld documents in a wrongful death lawsuit. Dozier's suit against the city had claimed that the incentives {{for the police to}} lie to obtain the warrant involved the quota system, which gives officers quotas for arrests and warrants. According to Dozier's motion, Lawyers for Johnston's family had asked the Atlanta Police Department for documents about the quotas before the trial began; the police chief had denied the existence of the quota system and the department indicated that there were no such documents. Dozier's motion claims that her lawyers obtained the documents another way and that APD officers had verified their authenticity during pretrial testimony. Alex White, the man the officers had used as their informant, also filed a lawsuit against Atlanta and police, claiming officers had held him against his will to pressure him to lie for the cover-up. In August 2010, Johnston's family was awarded $4.9 million in a settlement.|$|E
500|$|Streep's mother, {{whom she}} has {{compared}} in both appearance and manner to Dame Judi Dench, strongly encouraged her daughter and instilled confidence in her from a very young age. Streep has said: [...] "She was a mentor <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> to me, 'Meryl, you're capable. You're so great.' She was saying, 'You {{can do whatever you}} put your mind to. If you're lazy, you're not going to get it done. But if you put your mind to it, you can do anything.' And I believed her." [...] Although Streep was naturally more introverted than her mother, at times when she later needed an injection of confidence in adulthood, she would consult her mother, asking her for advice.|$|E
500|$|On April 10, 1834, a fire {{broke out}} in the LaLaurie {{residence}} on Royal Street, starting in the kitchen. [...] When the police and fire marshals got there, they found a seventy-year-old woman, the cook, chained to the stove by her ankle. [...] She later confessed to them that she had set the fire as a suicide attempt for fear of her punishment, being taken to the uppermost room, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that anyone who was taken there never came back. [...] As reported in the New Orleans Bee of April 11, 1834, bystanders responding to the fire attempted to enter the slave quarters to ensure that everyone had been evacuated. [...] Upon being refused the keys by the LaLauries, the bystanders broke down the doors to the slave quarters and found [...] "seven slaves, more or less horribly mutilated... suspended by the neck, with their limbs apparently stretched and torn from one extremity to the other", who claimed to have been imprisoned there for some months.|$|E

5000|$|The song's cryptic lyrics have {{inspired}} {{a number of}} listener theories {{as to what the}} song is really about. Reddy has refused to comment on what the true storyline of the song is, partly <b>because</b> <b>she</b> has <b>said</b> <b>she</b> enjoys hearing other listeners' interpretations. Reddy has also said that [...] "Angie Baby" [...] was the one song she never had to push radio stations into playing.|$|R
500|$|Sharp {{criticism}} from Catholic Church authorities put Ferraro {{on the defensive}} during the entire campaign, with abortion opponents frequently protesting her appearances {{with a level of}} fervor not usually encountered by pro-choice Catholic male candidates such as Mario Cuomo and Ted Kennedy. In a 1982 briefing for Congress, Ferraro had written that [...] "the Catholic position on abortion is not monolithic and there can be a range of personal and political responses to the issue." [...] Ferraro was criticized by Cardinal John O'Connor, the Catholic Archbishop of New York, and James Timlin, the Bishop of Scranton, for misrepresenting the Catholic Church's position on abortion. After several days of back-and-forth debate in the public media, Ferraro finally conceded that, [...] "the Catholic Church's position on abortion is monolithic" [...] but {{went on to say that}} [...] "But I do believe that there are a lot of Catholics who do not share the view of the Catholic Church". Ferraro was also criticized for saying that Reagan was not a [...] "good Christian" [...] <b>because,</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> his policies hurt the poor. To defend Ferraro, the pro-choice group Catholics for a Free Choice placed an October 7, 1984, full-page ad in The New York Times titled [...] "A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion".|$|E
500|$|Prior to the {{publication}} of Leigh Chadwick's English translation, an abbreviated version ran in the April 1967 edition of Natural History, a magazine published by the American Museum of Natural History. It comprised material from the book's introduction, first chapter, selected descriptions of genera, and the epilogue, and was presented as the lead story, without qualification, by the normally serious publication. The following month, The New York Times ran {{a story about the}} snouters on the front page, based on the Natural History article. According to the magazine's editorial director, they had [...] "received more than 100 letters and telegraphs about the snouters, most of them from people who forgot that the article was published on April Fool's Day." [...] Natural History printed several letters to the editor in its June–July issue, and conveyed to the Times the content of several more, ranging from skeptical to fascinated and continuations of the joke. One reader, entomologist Alice Gray, expressed thanks for the article, which enabled her family to identify an animal-shaped metal bracelet from the South Pacific as having been modeled after a [...] "Hoop Snouter", and included a drawing to preserve the record <b>because,</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> it had been melted down with some toy soldiers and a spoon by a young cousin with a new casting set.|$|E
500|$|The first Homicide season {{featured}} the first performances of Richard Belzer as Detective John Munch, a character the actor has been credited for in 459 television episodes (...) in nine different television series, including Homicide and [...] Levinson asked Belzer {{to audition for}} the part after hearing the comedian ranting on The Howard Stern Show, where Belzer was a frequent guest. Levinson said Belzer was a [...] "lousy actor" [...] during his first audition with the [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] script. Levinson asked Belzer {{to take some time}} to reread and practice the material, then come back and read it again. During his second reading, Levinson said Belzer was [...] "still terrible", but that the actor eventually found confidence in his performance. Daniel Baldwin was cast as Beau Felton, and dyed his naturally blond hair black for the role. Baldwin {{became one of the most}} vocal supporters of the show, giving many press interviews about it and defending it amid declining ratings. Baldwin declared, [...] "Homicide is the best material I've had the chance to do." [...] Melissa Leo was cast as Kay Howard, which was considered a particularly strong part compared to other female characters in police dramas at the time, which were usually limited to love interests or minor parts. While most cast members shadowed real-life Baltimore detectives to prepare for the roles, Leo did not <b>because,</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I don't like to look at the horror that's in the world." [...] Wendy Hughes was cast as medical examiner Carol Blythe.|$|E
60|$|Then suddenly, as {{was common}} {{with her when}} thus Ayesha threw her sight afar, which either from indolence, or <b>because,</b> as <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> it {{exhausted}} her, she did but rarely, her lovely face grew rigid {{like that of a}} person in a trance; the light faded from her brow, and the great pupils of her eyes contracted themselves and lost their colour.|$|R
5000|$|In 1983, Clarke {{appeared}} as Fran in two early episodes of the Liverpool-set Channel 4 soap opera Brookside, credited as Margi MacGregor. Her brother Frank wrote her in, <b>because,</b> as <b>she</b> later <b>said,</b> <b>she</b> [...] "had a gas bill which I couldn't pay".|$|R
5000|$|She {{decided to}} name the album Embers <b>because,</b> as <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "most of the songs that I wrote were about {{relationships}} that I've experienced and how they leave like tiny embers inside me still". Explaining further she stated [...] "Embers are the smoldering remains of a fire that was once ablaze. It represents all of the feelings that still remain even when that particular situation or relationship is over".|$|R

2500|$|Hank's mother, Claudette, {{called into}} the Stern Show on September 10, 2001 to {{publicly}} thank everyone who attended Hank's funeral and wake.

60|$|Within {{the hollow}} wall {{of an old}} brick mansion, away up near the roof, there lived a family of mice. It was a snug little home, {{pleasant}} and quiet, and as dark as any mouse could desire. Mamma Mouse liked it <b>because,</b> as <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> the draught that came through the rafters made it cool in summer, and they were near enough to the chimney to keep warm in wintertime.|$|R
50|$|When Kai had {{free time}} he visited Hikaru at the hospital. Hikaru's {{condition}} never improved, however. After a year, Shen-long warned Kai that Eiji actually only wanted his sister, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was <b>said</b> to possess amazing psychic powers, {{but she was}} not able to use them due to her illness. Shen-long then went on to tell Kai that Eiji was just hoping that Kai would have those amazing powers too.|$|R
60|$|She {{laid her}} little hand in mine, and I bent down until the flushed face was level with my own. When I {{found myself in}} the open air again, I strode through the scented shadows triumphantly. The Colonel's {{opposition}} counted as nothing then.

2500|$|After {{living in}} Los Angeles for 30 years, Ronstadt moved to San Francisco <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> she never {{felt at home}} in Southern California. [...] "Los Angeles became too {{enclosing}} an environment", she says. [...] "I couldn't breathe the air, and I didn't want to drive on the freeways {{to get to the}} studio. I also didn't want to embrace the values that have been so completely embraced by that city. Are you glamorous? Are you rich? Are you important? Do you have clout? It's just not me, and it never was me." [...] In 1997, Ronstadt sold her home in San Francisco and moved back to her hometown of Tucson, Arizona, to raise her two children. In more recent years, Ronstadt moved back to San Francisco while continuing to maintain her home in Tucson.|$|E
2500|$|Streisand {{changed her}} name from [...] "Barbara" [...] to [...] "Barbra" [...] <b>because,</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I hated the name, but I refused to change it."

You know, people were saying you could be Joanie Sands, or {{something}} like that. (My middle name is Joan.) And I said, 'No, let's see, if I take out the 'a,' it's still 'Barbara,' but it's unique." [...] A 1967 biography with a concert program said, [...] "the spelling of her first name is an instance of partial rebellion: she was advised to change her last name and retaliated by dropping an [...] "a" [...] from the first instead." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the San Diego office, edited video showed ACORN {{employee}} Juan Carlos Vera telling O'Keefe he had [...] "contacts" [...] in [...] "Tijuana" [...] to {{help get}} underage girls across the border. But, after the discussion with O'Keefe, Vera reported O'Keefe's fabricated plan for human smuggling to police. Vera was fired for what ACORN called [...] "unacceptable conduct." [...] Vera had said he tried to help the fake prostitute <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> {{that she needed to}} escape her controlling pimp. On July 8, 2010, after the AG's Report confirmed that he had contacted the police to try to thwart the couple's smuggling plan, Vera filed a civil suit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against O'Keefe and Giles for recording him without his permission, which was a violation of California law. In July 2012, Giles settled the case with Vera, leaving Vera's lawsuit with O'Keefe to move forward.|$|E

Many had expected this to be an autobiography but instead she wrote about people whose lives had inspired her. One of the activities she focused on was her interest in environmentalism. She continued {{to serve as a}} member of the Metro Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA). As reeve, one of her first acts had been to donate [...] of land in the Don Valley to the TRCA, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that the borough did not have the funds to properly manage it. She stated her environmental beliefs as, [...] "...prudent ecological management which the wise and far-seeing tell us is absolutely necessary for the future of the race." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1981 Wimbledon Championships, Evert beat Mandlíková in the final. [...] Most of the {{pressure}} was {{the fact of the}} dodgy weather overhead, but this would not materialize into anything; by the time Evert looked up a mere hour later she had her third Wimbledon title in tow with the match score at 6 games to 2 for both sets. [...] The only major struggle happened in the second game of the first set in which Evert survived two break points to level the set at one game all, and in the subsequent game broke her opponent's serve. [...] In addition, Evert had many 40-love points on her serve and love-40 points on her opponent's serve that made way for her to play freer and more aggressive <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> [...] "winning Wimbledon is no easy thing." [...] Evert said of herself being perceived by her opponent that [...] "she thought I was getting older and better...her instinct told her it would be my year." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{dramatic}} and unexpected entrance drew stares from {{the residents of}} the courtroom. Victoria Price, brought out for Bates to identify, glared at her. Attorney General Knight warned Price to [...] "keep your temper." [...] Bates proceeded to testify, and explained that no rape had occurred. She said none of the defendants had touched her or even spoken to her. When asked if she had been raped on March 25, 1931, Bates said, [...] "No sir." [...] When asked why she had initially said she had been raped, Bates replied, [...] "I told it just like Victoria did <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> we might have to stay in jail if we did not frame up a story after crossing a state line with men." [...] Bates explained that Price had said [...] "she didn't care if all the Negroes in Alabama were put in jail." [...] This recantation seemed to be a severe blow to the prosecution.|$|E
