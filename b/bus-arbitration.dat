40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a VLSI architecture of video decoder for AVS (Audio Video Coding Standard). The system architecture, {{as well as}} the design of major function-specific processing units (Variable Length Decoder, Deblockding Filter), is discussed. Analyzing the architecture of decoder system and the feature of each processing unit, we develop a system controller combined the centralized and decentralized control scheme, which provides high efficient communication between the processing units and minimizes the size of interconnected buffers. A <b>bus-arbitration</b> algorithm named Token Ring algorithm is designed to control the allocation of the SDRAM bus. This algorithm can avoid the conflicts on bus and reduce the internal buffer size, and its control logic is simple. Our simulation shows that this architecture can meet the requirement of AVS Jizhu...|$|E
