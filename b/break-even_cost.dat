40|$|In recent years, linear Fresnel (LF) {{collector}} {{systems have}} been developed as a technical alternative to parabolic trough (PT) collector systems. While in the past, LF systems focused on low- and medium-temperature applications, today, LF systems are equipped with vacuum receivers and, therefore, can be operated with similar operating parameters as PT systems. Papers about the technical and economical comparison of specific PT and LF systems have already been published (Dersch et al., 2009, "Comparison of Linear Fresnel and Parabolic Trough Collecor Systems—System Analysis to Determine <b>Break-Even</b> <b>Costs</b> of Linear Fresnel Collectors," Proceedings of the 15 th International SolarPACES Symposium, Berlin; Giostri et al. 2011, "Comparison of Two Linear Collectors in Solar Thermal Plants: Parabolic Trough vs. Fresnel," ASME 2011 5 th International Conference on Energy Sustainability, Washington, DC; and Morin et al., 2012, "Comparison of Linear Fresnel and Parabolic Trough Collector Power Plants," Sol. Energy, 86 (1), pp. 1 – 12). However, the present paper focuses on the systematic differences in optical and thermodynamic performance and {{the impact on the}} economic figures. In a first step the optical performance of typical PT and LF solar fields (SFs) has been examined, showing the differences {{during the course of the}} day and annually. Furthermore, the thermodynamic performance, depending on the operating temperature, has been compared. In a second step, the annual electricity yield of typical PT and LF plants has been examined. Solar Salt has been chosen as the heat transfer fluid. Both systems utilize the same power block (PB) and storage type. Solar field size, storage capacity, and PB electrical power are variable, while all examined configurations achieve the same annual electricity yield. As expected for molten salt systems, both systems are the most cost-effective with large storage capacities. The lower thermodynamic performance of the LF system requires a larger SF and lower specific SF costs in order to be competitive. Assuming specific PT field costs of 300 e/m 2 aperture, the <b>break-even</b> <b>costs</b> of the LF system with Solar Salt range between 202 and 235 e/m 2, depending on the site and storage capacity.

40|$|If direct {{tests for}} genetic {{mutations}} affecting economic traits in pig production where available, the tests {{could be used}} to increase the accuracy of selection, using gene-assisted selection (GAS). In this paper we evaluated the increased economic returns from using a direct genetic test in the nucleus of a commercial pig enterprise. A pig population with segregating quantitative trait loci (QTL) and markers was simulated. The QTL affected four independent traits, growth index (GI), net food intake (NFI), pigs born alive (PBA) and meat quality index (MQI). A direct genetic test was assumed to be available for the QTL which contributed the greatest proportion of genetic variance for each trait. Four strategies were investigated, GAS-GI, GAS-NFI, GAS-PBA and GAS-MQI, where in each strategy genotyping was available for an identified locus affecting only the trait in the strategy name. The effect of the QTL in each case was assumed to be known without error. For each strategy, GAS was conducted in a small nucleus population of 20 sows, and selection was on an index of the four quantitative traits. Extra dollar returns from the additional genetic gain from GAS schemes were calculated using an economic model of a pig enterprise (with a 100 sow nucleus, 1000 sow multiplier tier and 10000 sow commercial tier). Over five generations of selection, the extra returns from GAS were calculated as the discounted difference in response from GAS and non-GAS, in dollars. The extra returns were divided by the number of progeny in the nucleus each generation, multiplied by the number of generations required to fix the QTL and a discounting factor, to give the <b>break-even</b> <b>cost</b> of the genetic test. <b>Break-even</b> <b>cost</b> of test per animal were $ 104 for GAS-GI, $ 97 for GAS-NFI, $ 78 for GAS-PBA and $ 80 for GAS-MQI.

Calculation of break-even values of applying a preventive measure to reduce CM incidence or severity {{in the form of}} two fictitious mastitis vaccines were also carried out. Model input parameters were based on data from five large dairy herds in New York State (about 16, 000 lactations), but these parameters can be easily changed for other types of dairy operations. To demonstrate the usefulness of this model to assist individual cow CM treatment options, the cost of the decision to cull a third lactation cow, six months after calving, with the first case of CM, was negative $ 3 USD for a low milk producing open or pregnant cow (i. e. cull), and positive $ 850 USD for a high milk producing and pregnant cow (i. e. treat even with extremely high treatment cost). Compared with the model recommended optimal policy, a rule of thumb decision to routinely treat all cows with a first case of CM resulted in an additional cost of $ 2 per cow per year, a very low deviation from optimality and suggests all cows should be given a second chance. A policy of replacing all CM cows after their second CM case after treatment of the first CM incident resulted in an additional cost of $ 27 per cow per year. If the decision was to replace all cows only after their third CM case this cost estimate was $ 8.

40|$|During {{the past}} two years, {{considerable}} effort has been expended in developing the TRNSYS Hybrid Lighting Model. The work {{has resulted in a}} software tool that can simulate impacts associated with utilizing the hybrid lighting technology. All of the physical parameters of a hybrid lighting system are included as variables within the software. By utilizing this work, the hybrid lighting team can make design decisions based upon computer predictions of the performance of a hybrid lighting system. The hybrid lighting system is modeled using the transient system simulation program TRNSYS. The TRNSYS model is implemented using interconnected components, which include a weather generator, radiation processors, a hybrid lighting model, a building model, building schedules, utility rate schedules, and output components. The results from the simulation include the annual energy and monetary savings gained from the hybrid lighting system. An economic model has been incorporated into the hybrid lighting model to calculate the <b>break-even</b> capital <b>cost</b> of a hybrid lighting system based on the annual savings. A narrow-band and wide-band hybrid lighting model has been developed. The wide- band model uses direct normal solar radiation from either a TMY 2 data file or the TRNSYS weather generator. The incoming direct normal radiation is weighted by the average spectral properties of the hybrid lighting components which include concentrator reflectance, secondary element transmittance and reflectance, thermal photovoltaic quantum efficiency, light fiber attenuation, and luminaire efficiency. The narrow-band model uses TMY 2 data or the TRNSYS weather generator to obtain the magnitude of the direct normal radiation, but the direct normal spectral distribution is predicted based on the atmospheric transmission model SMARTS. The narrow-band model predicts the direct normal spectral radiation at five nanometer bandwidths. Next it reads the available spectral component data, applies the component data to the solar spectral distribution, and calculates the amount of light and electricity that is generated by the system. The outputs from both models include the light produced by the hybrid lighting system as well as electricity generated by the TPV. Within TRNSYS, the light output from the hybrid lighting system model is sent to the building model. The building is modeled using the TRNSYS type 56 multi-zone building model. Type 56 is a FORTRAN subroutine which is designed to provide detailed thermal models of buildings. The model consists of two windowless 2500 m 2 zones. One zone uses efficient fluorescent lighting and the other zone uses hybrid lighting with dimmable fluorescent auxiliary lighting. Identical schedules in the two zones simulate the heating, cooling, and ventilation of a typical mixed-use environment. Gains in the model account for the people, computers, and lights in the building. Cooling in the building is supplied using a chiller with a constant COP of 3 and heating loads are met using an 80 % efficient natural gas furnace. Using local utility rate schedules, energy costs can be calculated for the two zones of the building model with the difference representing the energy savings due to the hybrid lighting system. The hybrid lighting model calculates the <b>break-even</b> capital <b>cost</b> of a hybrid lighting system based on the system energy savings. The <b>break-even</b> capital <b>cost</b> is defined as the initial cost of the hybrid lighting system that will provide a life cycle savings (LCS) of zero over the economic lifetime. At this point in the design stage, realistic component prices are not available for determining economic parameters such as years to payback, LCS, or return on investment. Instead the <b>break-even</b> capital <b>cost</b> was calculated {{to be used as a}} price target where the energy savings predicted by the TRNSYS model will economically compensate for the system components.

An economic model has been incorporated into the hybrid lighting model to calculate the <b>break-even</b> capital <b>cost</b> of a hybrid lighting system based on the annual savings. A narrow-band and wide-band hybrid lighting model has been developed. The wide- band model uses direct normal solar radiation from either a TMY 2 data file or the TRNSYS weather generator. The incoming direct normal radiation is weighted by the average spectral properties of the hybrid lighting components which include concentrator reflectance, secondary element transmittance and reflectance, thermal photovoltaic quantum efficiency, light fiber attenuation, and luminaire efficiency. The narrow-band model uses TMY 2 data or the TRNSYS weather generator to obtain the magnitude of the direct normal radiation, but the direct normal spectral distribution is predicted based on the atmospheric transmission model SMARTS. The narrow-band model predicts the direct normal spectral radiation at five nanometer bandwidths. Next it reads the available spectral component data, applies the component data to the solar spectral distribution, and calculates the amount of light and electricity that is generated by the system. The outputs from both models include the light produced by the hybrid lighting system as well as electricity generated by the TPV. Within TRNSYS, the light output from the hybrid lighting system model is sent to the building model. The building is modeled using the TRNSYS type 56 multi-zone building model. Type 56 is a FORTRAN subroutine which is designed to provide detailed thermal models of buildings. The model consists of two windowless 2500 m 2 zones. One zone uses efficient fluorescent lighting and the other zone uses hybrid lighting with dimmable fluorescent auxiliary lighting. Identical schedules in the two zones simulate the heating, cooling, and ventilation of a typical mixed-use environment. Gains in the model account for the people, computers, and lights in the building. Cooling in the building is supplied using a chiller with a constant COP of 3 and heating loads are met using an 80 % efficient natural gas furnace. Using local utility rate schedules, energy costs can be calculated for the two zones of the building model with the difference representing the energy savings due to the hybrid lighting system. The hybrid lighting model calculates the <b>break-even</b> capital <b>cost</b> of a hybrid lighting system based on the system energy savings. The <b>break-even</b> capital <b>cost</b> is defined as the initial cost of the hybrid lighting system that will provide a life cycle savings (LCS) of zero over the economic lifetime. At this point in the design stage, realistic component prices are not available for determining economic parameters such as years to payback, LCS, or return on investment. Instead the <b>break-even</b> capital <b>cost</b> was calculated {{to be used as a}} price target where the energy savings predicted by the TRNSYS model will economically compensate for the system components. Simulations were performed to determine effectiveness of the hybrid lighting technology across the United States. Hybrid lighting systems located in Tucson, AZ and Honolulu, HI performed best with <b>break-even</b> capital <b>costs</b> of $ 2050 and $ 2800 based on a 10 year analysis period. Other daylighting strategies were evaluated to determine their cost competitiveness with hybrid lighting. Photovoltaics and toplighting were both evaluated using TRNSYS models. The <b>break-even</b> capital <b>cost</b> of the hybrid lighting system was approximately five times that of a toplighting or photovoltaic system. Photovoltaics are not an economic alternative, but the low cost and simple nature of toplighting makes it a very competitive alternative to hybrid lighting...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} presents cost optimisation {{results from}} a techno-economic perspective of photovoltaic battery systems. The simulation based optimisation takes into consideration temporal high-resolution consumer load and PV production profiles, technical and economical PV and battery system parameters {{as well as the}} regulatory framework in Germany. The results include the cost optimal system configuration under the given framework, the share of self-consumption, degree of autarky, grid feed-in and supply as well as various battery system parameters. The ratio of the installed PV peak power to the useable capacity of the battery was found to {{have a significant impact on}} self-consumption, autarky and economic efficiency of the overall system and is one of technical key parameters for a cost-optimised system sizing. The break-even battery system price compared to PV systems without BESS is calculated to approx. 900 €/kWh (without BESS support scheme) to 1200 €/kWh (with German BESS support scheme). However, the individual taxation of revenues can lower the <b>break-even</b> <b>costs</b> significantly. Furthermore, the techno-economic analysis identifies a high sensitivity to regulation frame conditions and support schemes of PV and BESS for cost optimisation. Another key finding is that realistic load and production profiles must be used in order to allow for reliable statements concerning technical parameters and economic feasibility. Otherwise, cost optimisation results might overestimate self-consumption and lead to an incorrect calculation of the total costs...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND. Successful {{programs}} to help pregnant women quit smoking have been developed and evaluated, but formal smoking cessation programs are {{not a part of}} care at most prenatal sites. The cost of such programs may be an issue. Considering the costs of adverse maternal and infant outcomes resulting from smoking, we estimated there would be an amount of money a prenatal program could invest in smoking cessation and still "break even" economically. METHODS. A model was developed and published data, along with 1989 hospital charge data, were used to arrive at a break-even point for smoking cessation programs in pregnancy. RESULTS. Using overall United States data, we arrived at a <b>break-even</b> <b>cost</b> of $ 32 per pregnant woman. When these data were varied to fit specific US populations, the break-even costs varied from $ 10 to $ 237, with the incidence of preterm low birth weight having the most impact on the cost. CONCLUSIONS. It may be advisable to invest greater amounts of money in a prenatal smoking cessation program for some populations. However, for every population there is an amount that can be invested while still breaking even...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to use a soybean crop model to estimate the difference in net return between variable–rate and uniform–rate management for soybean plant population and variety selection decisions. The CROPGRO–Soybean model was calibrated to fit three seasons of historical yield data in 77 grids within a 20 –ha field infested with soybean cyst nematodes (SCN) in central Iowa. Procedures were developed to compute the net return and <b>break–even</b> <b>cost</b> for variable plant population density and variety selection for SCN management using 34 years of historical weather data. Implementing the best population (VRX) for each year produced higher net returns compared to using the 34 –year average optimum rate (VRA) or using uniform management (UM). Achieving maximum possible net return under VRX may not be possible on a yearly basis due to uncertainties in weather condition. Risk–averse farmers, however, may opt to use the realistic 34 –year average optimum rate (VRA) that provides favorable net return over the long term. Procedures were also developed to determine gross profit and break–even costs for switching SCN–resistant and susceptible varieties within an SCN–infested field. Using an SCN–resistant variety across the entire field resulted in significant net returns over that of a susceptible variety, and there appeared to be no economic advantage for variable variety selection compared to planting a uniform resistant variety across the field...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{in this work}} was to evaluate the economicity of the finishing phase on feedlot of F 1 Red Angus &# 215; Nellore (½ RA ½ N) and Blond D'Aquitaine &# 215; Nellore (½ BA ½ N) crossbred young bulls slaughtered at 480, 520 and 560 kg of body weight. Thirty-six F 1 crossbred young bull with 20 months of initial average age: 18 ½RA½ N and 18 ½N½ BA were allotted to a completely randomized design in a 2 &# 215; 3 factorial arrangement (genetic group &# 215; slaughter weight), with six replicates. The ½ BA ½ N young bulls slaughtered at 480 kg had the highest carcass gain (kg/day), feed efficiency, gross income (R$/day), gross profit of feed (R$/day), <b>break-even</b> <b>cost</b> of the diet (@/t DM) and cost:benefit ratio. The ½ BA ½ N young bulls also had higher dressing percentage than ½ RA ½ N young bulls. As the slaughter weight rised the dressing percentage, feed:gain ratio, feed cost (R$/@ and R$/day) and break-even point (kg/day) increased; while the gross feed profit (R$/@) decreased. The bioeconomic multivariate nutritional index had better association with the profitability of the finishing phase of beef cattle on feedlot. Sensitivity analysis did not influence the results obtained. The benefit was lower than the feed cost from exchange relation of four (4) @/t DM of the diet. F 1 Blond D'Aquitaine &# 215; Nellore crossbred young bulls slaughtered at 480 kg of body weight showed the best bioeconomic efficiency...|$|E
30|$|As each {{financial}} institution which {{is able to}} sell bonds determines its own levels of commission, and given the difficulty of finding suitable transaction costs in the literature, {{in order to take}} a view on the transactions costs in our trading strategies, we report the <b>break-even</b> transaction <b>cost</b> for each strategy. This is defined as the transaction cost per trade which makes the mean return of the strategy equal to zero for our prediction period, 2000 – 2010. The higher the break-even level, the lower the trading intensity of the strategy and the higher the transaction costs required to eliminate its profitability.|$|R

40|$|Genomic {{selection}} is revolutionizing {{the design of}} breeding schemes, especially for dairy cattle. The fast uptake of genomic {{selection is}} a result of its potential to increase genetic gain considerably at an unprecedented rate by reducing the length of generation intervals up to three times. Predictions indicate that these decreased generation intervals increase genetic gain up to 100 %, when implementing genomic selection in dairy cattle breeding schemes. Genomic selection in dairy cattle breeding schemes is currently applied in three of the four different selection pathways; i. e. selection of sires and dams of bulls, and selection of sires of dams. Our objective was to review the potential economic benefit of genomic selection at the level of a dairy farm, by optimization of replacement strategies with or without use of genomic information of the female animals in the dairy herd. In this respect, genomic tests are used as a management tool to support on-farm replacement decisions, rather than as a tool to identify the best animals for breeding purposes. The potential benefit of using genomic tests comes through more accurate selection of the best animals for replacement compared to selection based on their pedigree index. Considered replacement strategies include a range of different selection intensities by considering different numbers of heifers available for replacement as well as different replacement rates. Results include computation of <b>break-even</b> <b>costs</b> for genomic tests for heifers, i. e. the maximum allowed cost per test that justifies their use to support replacement decisions. All comparisons were conducted using selection index theory...|$|R
