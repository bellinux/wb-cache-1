5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} {{possess a}} thick cell wall containing {{many layers of}} peptidoglycan and teichoic acids. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Lipopolysaccharides, also called endotoxins, are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A {{that is responsible for}} much of the toxicity of gram-negative bacteria. Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall, and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram-positive arrangement. These two groups were previously known as the low G+C and high G+C gram-positive bacteria, respectively. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, vancomycin can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast, whereas if it is partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> The enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defence against eye infections.|$|E
5|$|Phagocytes {{can also}} kill {{microbes}} by oxygen-independent methods, {{but these are}} not as effective as the oxygen-dependent ones. There are four main types. The first uses electrically charged proteins that damage the bacterium's membrane. The second type uses lysozymes; these enzymes break down the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> The third type uses lactoferrins, which are present in neutrophil granules and remove essential iron from bacteria. The fourth type uses proteases and hydrolytic enzymes; these enzymes are used to digest the proteins of destroyed bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacterial}} {{species are}} either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus, from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation {{is associated with}} swimming. Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface {{area to volume ratio}} of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.|$|E
40|$|Mutanolysin {{biosynthesis}} and pigment {{production in}} Streptomyces globisporus ATCC 21553 were stimulated by adding <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> to the medium. The increased bacteriolytic {{activity in the}} supernatant correlated with an increased de novo synthesis of mutanolysin and was between 4 - and 20 -fold higher than in cultures grown without <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b> The increase in mutanolysin synthesis was brought about by enhanced transcription of the mutanolysin gene. The stimulation was only observed in medium which contained dextrin or starch as the carbon source. Glucose abolished the stimulation and also inhibited the low constitutive synthesis of mutanolysin. The induction of lytic activity was observed to require minimally 0. 4 mg of <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> per ml, whereas 0. 6 mg of <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> per ml yielded maximal lytic activity. Further supplements of <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> {{did not result in}} enhanced lytic activity. The stimulation could be achieved independently of the phase of growth of the Streptomyces strain. Cultures grown in the presence of <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> exhibited a higher growth yield. However, the accelerated growth was not the reason for the increased amount of mutanolysin produced. The growth of cultures with peptidoglycan monomers added to the medium instead of <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> was similarly increased, but an effect on the biosynthesis of mutanolysin was not observed.

25|$|The {{presence}} of these chemicals in crude oil {{is a result of}} the inclusion of biological material in the oil; these chemicals are released by kerogen during the production of hydrocarbon oils, as these are chemicals highly resistant to degradation and plausible chemical paths have been studied. Abiotic defenders state that biomarkers get into oil during its way up as it gets in touch with ancient fossils. However a more plausible explanation is that biomarkers are traces of biological molecules from bacteria (archaea) that feed on primordial hydrocarbons and die in that environment. For example, hopanoids are just parts of the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> present in oil as contaminant.|$|E
500|$|In most bacteria, a {{cell wall}} is {{present on the}} outside of the cell {{membrane}}. The cell membrane and cell wall comprise the cell envelope. A common <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> material is peptidoglycan (called [...] "murein" [...] in older sources), which is made from polysaccharide chains cross-linked by peptides containing D-amino acids. Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of plants and fungi, which are made of cellulose and chitin, respectively. The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan. The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria, and the antibiotic penicillin is able to kill bacteria by inhibiting a step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan. The cell wall is absent in L-form bacteria. The main pathogenic types are some species of Mycoplasma.|$|E

2500|$|The cell {{envelope}} {{is composed}} of the plasma membrane and cell wall. As in other organisms, the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> provides structural integrity to the cell. In prokaryotes, the primary function of the cell wall {{is to protect the}} cell from internal turgor pressure caused by the much higher concentrations of proteins and other molecules inside the cell compared to its external environment. The <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> differs from that of all other organisms by the presence of peptidoglycan which is located immediately outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Peptidoglycan is made up of a polysaccharide backbone consisting of alternating N-Acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) residues in equal amounts. Peptidoglycan is responsible for the rigidity of the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> and for the determination of cell shape. It is relatively porous and is not considered to be a permeability barrier for small substrates. While all bacterial cell walls (with a few exceptions e.g. extracellular parasites such as Mycoplasma) contain peptidoglycan, not all cell walls have the same overall structures. Since the cell wall is required for bacterial survival, but is absent in some eukaryotes, several antibiotics (notably the penicillins and cephalosporins) stop bacterial infections by interfering with cell wall synthesis, while having no effects on human cells which have no cell wall only a cell membrane. There are two main types of bacterial cell walls, those of gram-positive bacteria and those of gram-negative bacteria, which are differentiated by their Gram staining characteristics. [...] For both these types of bacteria, particles of approximately 2nm can pass through the peptidoglycan. If the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast while if it's partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics such as penicillin inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> The enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defense against eye infections.|$|E

2500|$|Cephalosporins are {{bactericidal}} {{and have}} the same mode of action as other β-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillins), but are less susceptible to β-lactamases. Cephalosporins disrupt the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer forming the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> [...] The peptidoglycan layer is important for cell wall structural integrity. [...] The final transpeptidation step in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan is facilitated by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). PBPs bind to the D-Ala-D-Ala {{at the end of}} muropeptides (peptidoglycan precursors) to crosslink the peptidoglycan. Beta-lactam antibiotics mimic the D-Ala-D-Ala site, thereby irreversibly inhibiting PBP crosslinking of peptidoglycan.|$|E

2500|$|Cefalexin is a {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic of the cephalosporin family. [...] It is bactericidal {{and acts}} by inhibiting {{synthesis of the}} peptidoglycan layer of the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> As cefalexin closely resembles d-alanyl-d-alanine, an amino acid ending on the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall, {{it is able to}} irreversibly bind to the active site of PBP, which is essential for the synthesis of the cell wall. It is most active against gram-positive cocci, and has moderate activity against some gram-negative bacilli. However, some bacterial cells have the enzyme β-lactamase, which hydrolyzes the beta-lactam ring, rendering the drug inactive. This contributes to antibacterial resistance towards cephalexin.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the outside}} of the cell {{membrane}} is the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> Bacterial cell walls are made of peptidoglycan (also called murein), which is made from polysaccharide chains cross-linked by unusual peptides containing D-amino acids. Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of plants and fungi which are made of cellulose and chitin, respectively. The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan. The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria, although L-form bacteria can be produced in the laboratory that lack a cell wall. [...] The antibiotic penicillin is able to kill bacteria by preventing the cross-linking of peptidoglycan and this causes the cell wall to weaken and lyse. The lysozyme enzyme can also damage bacterial cell walls.|$|E
2500|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for S. aureus infection is penicillin. An antibiotic derived from some Penicillium fungal species, penicillin inhibits the formation of peptidoglycan cross-linkages that provide the rigidity and strength in a <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> The four-membered β-lactam ring of penicillin is bound to enzyme DD-transpeptidase, an enzyme that when functional, cross-links chains of peptidoglycan that form bacterial cell walls. The binding of β-lactam to DD-transpeptidase inhibits the enzyme’s functionality and {{it can no longer}} catalyze the formation of the cross-links. As a result, cell wall formation and degradation are imbalanced, thus resulting in cell death. In most countries, however, penicillin resistance is extremely common, and first-line therapy is most commonly a penicillinase-resistant β-lactam antibiotic (for example, oxacillin or flucloxacillin, both of which have the same mechanism of action as penicillin). [...] Combination therapy with gentamicin may be used to treat serious infections, such as endocarditis, but its use is controversial because of the high risk of damage to the kidneys.

2500|$|Their use has {{continued}} {{since the end}} of the Cold War in Georgia and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe. The first regulated, randomized, double-blind clinical trial was reported in the Journal of Wound Care in June 2009, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of a bacteriophage cocktail to treat infected venous leg ulcers in human patients. The FDA approved the study as a Phase I clinical trial. The study's results demonstrated the safety of therapeutic application of bacteriophages but did not show efficacy. The authors explain that the use of certain chemicals that are part of standard wound care (e.g. lactoferrin or silver) may have interfered with bacteriophage viability. Another controlled clinical trial in Western Europe (treatment of ear infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was reported shortly after in the journal Clinical Otolaryngology in August 2009. The study concludes that bacteriophage preparations were safe and effective for treatment of chronic ear infections in humans. Additionally, there have been numerous animal and other experimental clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of bacteriophages for various diseases, such as infected burns and wounds, and cystic fibrosis associated lung infections, among others. Meanwhile, bacteriophage researchers are developing engineered viruses to overcome antibiotic resistance, and engineering the phage genes responsible for coding enzymes which degrade the biofilm matrix, phage structural proteins and also enzymes responsible for lysis of <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> There have been results showing that T4 phages that are small in size and short-tailed can be helpful in detecting E.coli [...] in the human body.|$|E
2500|$|For Burkholderia pseudomallei, some {{clinical}} antibiotic {{agents that}} are used to treat its infection, mellioidosis, can induce morphological changes such as filamentation and physiological changes in this bacteria. These antibiotics are the β-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and antibiotics that inhibit the synthesis of thymidine. The ability of some β-lactam antibiotics to induce filamentation in gram negative bacteria is to inhibit penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This inhibition stops the assembly of peptidoglycan network in <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> PBP-1 inhibition leads to rapid cell death. While PBP-2 and PBP-3 inhibition lead to morphological change, turn normal cells to spheroplasts and filamentous cells (elongated rods), respectively. PBP-3 forms the septum in dividing bacteria by involving transpeptidase so inhibition of this PBP-3 protein leads to the incomplete formation of septa in dividing bacteria resulting in the formation of long strands of bacteria (filaments). [...] Kang Chen et al. mentioned that the filament was induced by sublethal concentrations of ceftazidime, ofloxacin, or trimethoprim. At or below the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), filamentation occurred mainly at these concentration and bacteria remained as viable within the vacuoles of immortalized human macrophages, not rapidly killed. [...] However, the B.pseudomallei filaments revert to normal forms when the antibiotics are removed. Moreover, bacillary daughter cells maintained cell-division capacity and viability despite re-exposure to antibiotics such as ceftazidime. Thus, this developmental alteration may provide additionally survival advantages to bacteria. [...] Furthermore, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, filamentation induced by antibiotics appears to trigger bacteria to change from a normal growth phase to a stationary growth phase. [...] Filamentous bacteria are also associated with an increase in endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) release and the immune system of patients needs to cope with this characteristic. Chloramphenicol antibiotic can induce the formation of filamentous cells, which contain multiple copies of unsegregated chromosomes. These chromosomes lead to the unsuccessful division of elongated cells, and the formation of bacterial filament. Moreover, the filamentation also depends on the expression levels of an efflux pump (MexAB-OprM) and the minimum inhibitory concentration of chloramphenicol.|$|E
