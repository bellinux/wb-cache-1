This is known as the subtraction paradigm.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the construction of}} minimum aberra- tion (MA) <b>blocked</b> factorial <b>designs.</b> Based on coding theory, the con- cept of minimum moment aberration due to Xu (2003) for unblocked designs is extended to <b>blocked</b> <b>designs.</b> The coding theory approach studies designs in a row-wise fashion and therefore links <b>blocked</b> <b>designs</b> with nonregular and supersaturated designs. A lower bound on blocked wordlength pattern is established. It is shown that a <b>blocked</b> <b>design</b> has MA if it originates from an unblocked MA design and achieves the lower bound. It is also shown that a regular design can be partitioned into maximal blocks {{if and only if}} it contains a row without zeros. Sufficient conditions are given for constructing MA <b>blocked</b> <b>designs</b> from unblocked MA designs. The theory is then applied to construct MA <b>blocked</b> <b>designs</b> for all 32 runs, 64 runs up to 32 factors, and all 81 runs with respect to four combined wordlength patterns...|$|R
25|$|The {{mathematical}} {{subject of}} <b>block</b> <b>designs</b> {{originated in the}} statistical framework of design of experiments.

25|$|If D is a {{difference}} set, and g in G, then g Dnbsp&=nbsp&{gd: d in D} is also {{a difference}} set, and is called a translate of D. The set of all translates of a difference set D forms a symmetric <b>block</b> <b>design.</b> In such a design there are v elements and v blocks. Each block of the design consists of k points, each point is contained in k blocks. Any two blocks have exactly λ elements in common and any two points appear together in λ blocks.

25|$|In chronic opioid users, such {{as those}} on Chronic Opioid Analgesic Therapy (COAT) for {{managing}} severe, chronic pain, behavioural testing has shown normal functioning on perception, cognition, coordination and behaviour in most cases. One 2000 study analysed COAT patients {{to determine whether they}} were able to safely operate a motor vehicle. The findings from this study suggest that stable opioid use does not significantly impair abilities inherent in driving (this includes physical, cognitive and perceptual skills). COAT patients showed rapid completion of tasks that require speed of responding for successful performance (e.g., Rey Complex Figure Test) but made more errors than controls. COAT patients showed no deficits in visual-spatial perception and organization (as shown in the WAIS-R <b>Block</b> <b>Design</b> Test) but did show impaired immediate and short-term visual memory (as shown on the Rey Complex Figure Test– Recall). These patients showed no impairments in higher order cognitive abilities (i.e., planning). COAT patients appeared to have difficulty following instructions and showed a propensity toward impulsive behaviour, yet this did not reach statistical significance. It {{is important to note that}} this study reveals that COAT patients have no domain-specific deficits, which supports the notion that chronic opioid use has minor effects on psychomotor, cognitive, or neuropsychological functioning.|$|E
500|$|Another issue {{concerned}} {{the strength of}} the locomotive frames around the cylinders. Taking inspiration from the 3-cylinder locomotives designed by Vincent Raven for the North Eastern Railway, Holcroft suggested that all three cylinders and associated steam passages should be cast in a single block, with rectangular holes cut into the frames to enable the outside cylinders to project through them. [...] However, the SECR’s established practice of using outside steam chests on locomotives with outside cylinders prevented this, and the design team resorted to cutting a gap in the frames to accommodate the outside cylinders, which were then secured in place with a bolted splice plate. Production limitations at the Ashford works foundry also prevented the manufacture of a single casting that incorporated all three cylinders. [...] This meant that the cylinder castings were split into two sections, with the left and inside cylinders forming a single unit that would be bolted onto a separate right-hand cylinder casting. Holcroft’s new cylinder <b>block</b> <b>design</b> also incorporated a separate saddle casting, a configuration that allowed the N1 cylinder patterns to be used with any diameter of smokebox, creating a standard component with potential applications on future locomotive designs.|$|E
