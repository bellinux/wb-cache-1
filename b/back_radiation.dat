A new low cost thin Pyralux substrate with a thickness of 75 µm, relative permittivity of εr = 2. 4 and tan δ = 0. 002 is used. First we developed the known classical aperture coupled antennas based on FR 4 and pyralux substrate to validate this technology. The simulated and measured antenna radiation parameters {{for a single}} patch and 1 × 4 array of patches using aperture coupled technology give good results in terms of S 11 bandwidth, gain and radiation pattern. But the <b>back</b> <b>radiation</b> {{is found to be}} high due to some radiation from the slot and the feeding microstrip line. Measurements of the antennas show approximately 9. 7 % and 10. 8 % impedance bandwidth (S 11 = − 10 dB) with a maximum gain of 7. 6 dBi and 12. 4 dBi around 60 GHz, respectively.

40|$|A novel {{design of}} 2 by 2 {{aperture}} coupled microstrip antenna (ACMSA) with back lobe reduction and gain enhancement {{is presented in}} this thesis. The basic design of the proposed antenna uses a 2 by 2 planar array structures with aperture coupler feeding technique. Both of the substrates are Rogers Duroid 5880 of thickness 0. 787 mm with dielectric constant of 2. 2 and named as Structure 1. Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) is first integrated onto the antenna, Structure 2, via two approaches; by placing them onto the feedline layer and also onto the patch layer to study and analyze {{the effect on the}} ACMSA. The gain of the antenna slightly improved but the <b>back</b> <b>radiation</b> does not give any good reduction. Next, the Defected Ground Structure (DGS) concept was proposed in Structure 3 to realize the <b>back</b> <b>radiation</b> reduction effect. Four DGS with dumbbell shape were etched on the ground plane, which is sandwiched between the upper and lower substrates. Structure 4 was introduced as twelve trapezoidal-shaped parasitic elements are placed onto the first substrate, three elements besides each patch of Structure 3. The antenna design is simulated in CST Microwave Studio software with operating frequency of 5. 8 GHz. The results show that back lobe level is reduced from 4. 6 dB to - 0. 06 dB. The gain of the antenna dropped from 11. 8 dB to 11. 2 dB when DGS is added. However with the parasitic element, the gain is improved to 11. 5 dB. An improvement can be seen to the front-toback ratio of the antenna. With the addition of DGS and parasitic element, the ratio improves from 7. 2 dB to 11. 37 dB. Return loss of the antenna is - 27. 50 dB. This design concept can be useful in reducing the <b>back</b> <b>radiation</b> of aperture coupled microstrip antenna and improve the front-to-back ratio...|$|E
