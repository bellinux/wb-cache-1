Methods Data are from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being, CPS sample (n 5, 501). Adolescents with asthma (n 101, ages 11 – 15 years) self-reported their negative family emotion-al climate (NFEC; caregiver psychological aggression and caregiver relationship quality), caregiver–adolescent relational security, and depressive symptoms. Caregivers rated adolescent health quality. Models were tested using path analyses and bootstrapping.

Vulvodynia is a genital syndrome of multi-causal origin and requires a team approach. The purpose of the case report of provoked vulvodynia is to show the efficacy of individualized, multifaceted and multidisciplinary therapeutic team approach used by a gynaecologist with special knowledge of sexology and a physiotherapist specialising in treatment of pelvic floor dysfunction.   Case report: A 35 -year old patient presented with a complaint of genital itching and consequently burning pain which first occurred during sexual intercourse one year previously. Afterwards a gynaecologist with special knowledge of sexology performed a <b>biopsychosocial</b> <b>assessment,</b> broader gynaecological examination and psychoeducation.

The Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act {{addressed the}} {{cruel and unusual}} punishment of the urban homeless under quality of life ordinances by requiring constructive alternatives to criminalizing homelessness. As enforced, these quality of life ordinances move homeless and poor people about cities and downtown areas. San Diego's St. Vincent de Paul Villages granted access to its 2008 <b>biopsychosocial</b> <b>assessments</b> to evaluate relationships between risk factors for homelessness and criminal interventions. Spearman's r was used to evaluate whether there is an association between the percent of the respondents' lifetime her or she spent homeless, and the number of times the individual was jailed. There is a positive, though moderate, correlation between the percent of lifetime her or she spent homeless and the number of times her or she was jailed (r = 0. 34, p = 0. 001). To ask what puts homeless individuals at risk for criminal intervention, a step-wise logistic regression model and Wald criteria were used to describe how risk factors for homelessness and incarceration are associated with the incarceration of the homeless. Days of drinking annually (B = 0. 002) and low education attainment (B = - 0. 117) both contribute significantly to the likelihood the homeless respondent had been incarcerated (p < 0. 05). Where other risk factors are present, and a profile or sub-population is more vulnerable, one episode of jailing could initiate a career of homelessness, or a single but enduring episode of homelessness...|$|R
40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the role of {{different}} bio-psycho-social risk factors for the onset of depression among patients with Hepatitis C (HCV) treated with Interferon alpha (IFN). Material and methods Patients with HCV were recruited and assessed prospectively at baseline and after 4, 8, and 24 weeks since the start of IFN treatment. Assessments included the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scales (HAM-D and HAM-A), Toronto Alexithymia Scale, Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego, 110 item version (TEMPS-A), Young Mania Rating Scale and other assessment tools. Sociodemographic and clinical factors were entered as predictors in logistic regression models, with early-onset depression (4 weeks) or persistent depression (24 weeks) as the outcomes. Results Early-onset depression was predicted by preexisting depressive symptoms’ severity (baseline HAM-D scores: OR =  1. 24; 95 % CI: 1. 03, 1. 50; p =  0. 03) and by the presence of additional physical comorbidities (OR =  3. 74; 95 % CI: 1. 12, 12. 5; p =  0. 03). Persistent depression was predicted by additional physical comorbidities (OR =  7. 75; 95 % CI: 1. 33, 45. 0, p =  0. 02), depressive temperament (OR =  8. 95; 95 % CI: 1. 32, 60. 6; p =  0. 03) and, at trend-level, by unknown mode of HCV contagion (OR =  5. 21; 95 % CI: 0. 89, 30. 4; p =  0. 07).

40|$|Project (M. S. W., Social Work) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Abuse {{in foster}} care {{is one of the}} reasons why {{children}} {{in foster care}} do not experience stable foster placements. Another reason for placement disruption is limited caregiver capacity to care for the children and provide permanency. These circumstances occur in nonrelated foster care as well as kinship care. While kinship care is regarded as the least restrictive placement when considering out-of-home placement for children, it is not always successful because of placement disruption. In this study, the researchers compared the biopsychosocial characteristics between successful kinship caregivers and those who had a subsequent placement disruption. If social workers are aware of the risks that predispose families to placement disruption, there can be safety plans developed to prevent disruption and strengthen families. 	The researchers selected 30 kinship caregiving families from Sacramento County Department of Health and Human Services who had relative foster children placed with them in 2008. There were 15 successful families selected, who either maintained children in placement until reunification with the families of origin, adopted, assumed guardianship, or demonstrated placement stability for a period of two years. The initial <b>biopsychosocial</b> <b>assessments</b> of these families were compared to 15 families who subsequently had their relative foster children removed from the home, either due to abuse or an inability to care for the children. 	Significant findings show that there was a correlation between successful kinship foster placements and kinship caregiver age. Interestingly, the successful kinship caregivers were older than the kinship caregivers who had a placement disruption. The older caregivers also suffered more health problems, and had more criminal convictions in the past. Social Wor...|$|R

All obstetric patients at seven health centers located in Argentina, Colombia, Honduras, and Uruguay from November 1992 through January 1994 whose initial prenatal visits occurred between the 14 th and 28 th week of gestation were invited to participate. Information was obtained on 979 mother-infant pairs. High PBRS scores showed sensitivity of 62. 1 % and specificity of 81. 3 %, positive predictive value (PPV) of 45. 3 % and negative predictive value (NPV) of 89. 5 %, with respect to low birthweight.

40|$|Central {{sensitization}} {{provides an}} evidence-based explanation for {{many cases of}} 'unexplained' chronic musculoskeletal pain. Prior to commencing rehabilitation in such cases, {{it is crucial to}} change maladaptive illness perceptions, to alter maladaptive pain cognitions and to reconceptualise pain. This can be accomplished by patient education about central sensitization and its role in chronic pain, a strategy known as pain physiology education. Pain physiology education is indicated when: 1) the clinical picture is characterized and dominated by central sensitization; and 2) maladaptive illness perceptions are present. Both are prerequisites for commencing pain physiology education. Face-to-face sessions of pain physiology education, in conjunction with written educational material, are effective for changing pain cognitions and improving health status in patients with various chronic musculoskeletal pain disorders. These include patients with chronic low back pain, chronic whiplash, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. After <b>biopsychosocial</b> <b>assessment</b> pain physiology education comprises of a first face-to-face session explaining basic pain physiology and contrasting acute nociception versus chronic pain (Session 1). Written information about pain physiology should be provided as homework in between session 1 and 2.

Pain physiology education is a continuous process initiated during the educational sessions and continued within both the active treatment and during the longer term rehabilitation program.

40|$|UNLABELLED: While {{problematic}} Internet use {{is recognized}} to be predominant among male adolescents, a female trend is gradually becoming apparent. Our study aimed at investigating {{the characteristics of}} female Internet users and distinguishing between the online activities of problematic and regular Internet users' on school days. Data were retrieved from a cross-sectional survey of {{a representative sample of}} 3067 8 th graders in the canton of Vaud, Switzerland, that completed an online questionnaire in 2012. Only females were included. Based on the Internet addiction test, the sample was divided into regular (RUs) (IAT[*]<[*] 50, n[*]=[*] 1339) and problematic users (PIUs) (IAT[*]≥[*] 50, n[*]=[*] 201). Groups were compared regarding sociodemographic variables, online activities, devices used to access the Internet, substance use, and physical activity. Significant variables were included in a backward logistic regression. At the multivariate level, PIUs were more prone to spend time online for leisure activities (odds ratio [OR] 2. 38) and to access the Internet through a smartphone (OR 1. 79) or tablet (OR 1. 84).

This study explores how a novel biopsychosocial, stepped-care treatment for NCCP works, and explores outcomes at each step and process variables. Methods: Patients with persistent NCCP were referred to a new biopsychosocial, multidisciplinary clinic for chest pain (CP). There were three possible ‘steps’ of treatment: (1) <b>biopsychosocial</b> <b>assessment</b> (BA) only, (2) BA plus low-intensity cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and (3) BA plus high-intensity CBT. Outcome measures assessed chest pain (frequency and interference), anxiety (GAD 7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 (PHQ- 9)), somatic symptoms (PHQ- 15) and illness perceptions (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire) at baseline, 3 and 6 months post-assessment. Participants gave feedback about treatment once completed, which was analysed using content analysis. Results: Significant improvements were found on all outcome measures at 3 months and 6 months compared to baseline. Benefits were found in all treatment steps and occurred regardless of baseline distress, chest pain or demographic characteristics. The strongest predictor of improvement in chest pain at 6 months was a positive change in illness perceptions at 3 months. Patients reported how treatment helped by increasing their understanding of chest pain, reducing concern and improving their sense of control. Conclusions: A biopsychosocial, stepped-care intervention appears to be effective, efficient and acceptable {{for a variety of}} patients with NCCP. Changes in beliefs about chest pain were the main predictors of improvement (reduced chest pain interference and frequency) at 6 months follow up...|$|E

40|$|A {{complex and}} dynamic set of biological, {{psychological}} and social factors interact to determine the consequences of acquired brain injury (ABI). This has led to recognition {{of the need for}} an integrated <b>biopsychosocial</b> approach to <b>assessment,</b> formulation and rehabilitation after ABI, drawing on multiple methods and models. This presents a significant challenge for the development and evaluation of complex rehabilitation programmes that may involve multiple interventions. In psychotherapy research, such problems are addressed through an approach which emphasises theoretical modelling of the disorder from which treatment programmes are developed and then evaluated. The resulting outcome studies, in which theoretically grounded change processes are measured, thus provide not only a test of the efficacy of the intervention but also an empirical evaluation of the underpinning model. In this paper we advocate such an approach to ABI rehabilitation, and to this end propose a model of the change process in rehabilitation called the “Y-shaped” model. This integrates findings from research into psychosocial adjustment, awareness and well-being following brain injury. The notion of discrepant or threatened identity is central to the model. Specific interventions are identified from the model, along with processes and interactions that may be central to change in rehabilitation. In conclusion, we propose that development of integrated models of change in rehabilitation is required. We also note that outcome should focus not only on level of activity or social participation, but also on the personal meaning of this to the person with brain injury...|$|R
40|$|Treatment with {{aromatase}} inhibitors for {{postmenopausal women}} {{with breast cancer}} {{has been shown to}} reduce or obviate invasive procedures such as hysteroscopy or curettage associated with tamoxifen-induced endometrial abnormalities. The side effect of upfront aromatase inhibitors, diminished estrogen synthesis, is similar to that seen with the natural events of aging. The consequences often include vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes) and vaginal dryness and atrophy, which in turn may result in cystitis and vaginitis. Not surprisingly, painful intercourse (dyspareunia) and loss of sexual interest (decreased libido) frequently occur as well. Various interventions, both non-hormonal and hormonal, are currently available to manage these problems. The purpose of the present review is to provide the practitioner with a wide array of management options to assist in treating the sexual consequences of aromatase inhibitors. The suggestions in this review are based on recent literature and on the recommendations set forth both by the North American Menopause Association and in the clinical practice guidelines of the Society of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians of Canada. The complexity of female sexual dysfunction necessitates a <b>biopsychosocial</b> approach to <b>assessment</b> and management alike, with interventions ranging from education and lifestyle changes to sexual counselling, pelvic floor therapies, sexual aids, medications, and dietary supplements—all of which have been reported to have a variable, but often successful, effect on symptom amelioration. Although the use of specific hormone replacement—most commonly local estrogen, and less commonly, systemic estrogen with or without an androgen, progesterone, or the additional of an androgen in an estrogenized woman (or a combination) —may be highly effective, the concern remains that in patients with estrogen-dependent breast cancer, including those receiving anti-estrogenic adjuvant therapies, the use of these hormones may be attended with potential risk. Therefore, non-hormonal alternatives should in all cases be initially tried with the expectation that symptomatic relief can often be achieved...|$|R
40|$|As {{a social}} work {{educator}} and yoga teacher, I have found it curious that the body and embodied knowledge have not {{been the subject of}} more debate in the social work literature or focus in professional training. In general where and when the body is mentioned, authors either provide a note of caution warning the practitioner against relying on the body as a source of knowledge and/or a reminder that, as an object, the body has been the cause of much social oppression. Yet, much of social work practice is underpinned by the practitioner's visceral experience. For example, in the process of gathering data to complete a <b>biopsychosocial</b> <b>assessment</b> of a presenting issue that will both inform and guide any intervention strategy, the social worker must navigate both community and clients' physical spaces while negotiating their own somatic maps. Whereas social work education focuses on developing the cognitive and discursive aspects of self-awareness and reflection, recent neuroscientific studies confirm what has long been known in Eastern embodied practices, that the body is the 'main channel for influencing the mind'. Drawing on the literature exploring the mind–body connection interspersed with my own experience using yoga as a reflexive practice, I argue that making the role of the body more visible in the professional discourse and placing a greater emphasis on embodied knowledge in social work education strengthens the reflexive capacity of future practitioners leading to a greater health and well-being of social workers and better outcomes for their clients...|$|E
40|$|Background Non-cardiac {{chest pain}} (NCCP) affects up to 80 % of {{patients}} attending chest pain clinics, but its treatment is suboptimal. Aim To describe {{the outcomes of}} a pilot, stepped care, biopsychosocial management programme in terms of improvements in chest pain, psychosocial scores and use of healthcare resources. Methods Of 198 referrals, 77 patients were suitable for the clinic and received a one hour <b>biopsychosocial</b> <b>assessment.</b> Stepped care consisted of assessment only, low intensity Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), or high intensity CBT. Results The proportion with pain occurring more than once monthly fell from 100 % at baseline to 61 % at 3 months (p < 0. 001). Pain interference reduced significantly (p < 0. 001) from 5. 9 [SD 2. 2] at baseline to 3. 2 [SD 2. 6] at 3 months. Depression scores improved from a mean 8. 8 to 5. 4 (p < 0. 05) and anxiety from 6. 9 to 4. 6 (p < 0. 05). Use of healthcare resources improved with a fall in consultations for chest pain over 6 months from a mean 2. 6 to 0. 1 (p < 0. 05). The impact on work and social functioning reduced from 10. 4 [SD 10. 4] to 3. 9 [SD 7. 5]: [t (70) = 6. 3, p < 0. 001). Further improvements occurred at 6 months for chest pain frequency (which fell to 51 %, p = 0. 003), interference (2. 6 [SD 2. 1], p < 0. 05) and avoidance of exercise (p = 0. 03). Otherwise improvements were maintained between 3 and 6 months. Conclusion A stepped-care biopsychosocial approach to NCCP is effective in reducing chest pain frequency and improving behaviour and wellbeing. It can be delivered {{in part by a}} nurse allowing integration into any chest pain clinic...|$|E
40|$|Background: Solitary rectal ulcer {{syndrome}} (SRUS) is {{a chronic}} disorder of the gastrointestinal tract and its etiology {{is not well}} understood. There is no specific treatment for this syndrome and patients with SRUS may, for years, experience many complications. The aim of the present research was the biopsychosocial study of patients with SRUS. Methods: The study participants consisted of 16 patients with SRUS (7 men and 9 women). Their medical records were reviewed retrospectively to evaluate the clinical spectrum of the patients along with the endoscopic and histological findings. Moreover, psychiatric and personality disorders [based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 th ed, Text Revision (DSM IV-TR) ], psychosocial stressors, early life traumas, and coping mechanisms were assessed through structured interviews. Results: At presentation, {{mean age of the}} patients was 39 years (16 to 70). Common symptoms reported included rectal bleeding (93. 8 %), rectal self-digitations (81. 2 %), passage of mucous (75 %), anal pain (75 %), and straining (75 %). Endoscopically, solitary and multiple lesions were present in 9 (60 %) and 4 (26. 7 %) patients, respectively, and 87 % of lesions were ulcerative and 13. 3 % polypoidal. The most common histological findings were superficial ulceration (92. 85 %) and intercryptic fibromuscular obliteration (87. 71 %). Common psychosocial findings included anxiety disorders (50 %), depression (37. 5 %), obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) or traits (62. 5 %), interpersonal problems (43. 75 %), marital conflicts (43. 75 %), occupational stress (37. 5 %), early life traumas, physical abuse (31. 25 %), sexual abuse (31. 25 %), dysfunctional coping mechanisms, emotional inhibition (50 %), and non-assertiveness (37. 5 %). Conclusion: Given the evidence in this study, we cannot ignore the psychosocial problems of patients with SRUS and <b>biopsychosocial</b> <b>assessment</b> of SRUS is more appropriate than biomedical evaluation alone. </div...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis documents a qualitative exploration {{of some of}} the wider contextual issues relating to disability following traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is a relatively high prevalence of long term disability following TBI. Family members often provide informal care and can experience negative psychological outcomes as a result. The systematic literature review in section one presents a metasynthesis of 15 qualitative papers exploring the experience of caregiving following TBI. Negative emotional reactions were experienced, due to changes to their injured relative and to their own lives. Caregivers were more able to cope if they could develop a good understanding of the person with TBI. Importantly, this review noted that families experienced a sense of wider supports crumbling beneath them following discharge form hospital. Lack of material, social, and professional supports intensified experiences of distress, as caregivers had fewer options. The findings support the need to address wider issues alongside any individual intervention. Many people with TBI need to claim state financial benefits due to disability. The Work Capability Assessment (WCA) was introduced in the UK to assess ability to work and decide upon benefits received. The WCA process has been associated with increased mental health difficulties and has been criticised for neglecting contextual factors. The assessment may not be suited to the complexity of impairment following TBI. The research paper in section two explores the experiences of nine adults with TBI regarding the WCA. The data was analysed using critical narrative analysis. Participants experienced the assessment as distressing and saw the WCA as neglecting important functional difficulties. They experienced multiple barriers to the process. There is a need for the WCA to adopt a <b>biopsychosocial</b> approach to <b>assessment</b> of disability, and to make reasonable adjustments for people with TBI...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: {{musculoskeletal}} disorders (MSDs) {{are a major}} cause of pain and disability, constituting a significant societal burden. Psychological constructs are important predictors and mediators for developing and maintaining long term pain-related disability and a <b>biopsychosocial</b> approach to <b>assessment</b> and treatment of MSDs is recommended. Physiotherapists are a key professional group assessing and treating people with MSDs but screening by them for psychosocial risk factors is inconsistent. Embedding routine collection of patient-reported psychological factors such as depression, pain self-efficacy and avoidance behaviours, may improve quality of patient care and outcomes. Method: the primary aim of this project was to implement screening for psychological risk factors in people attending a NHS physiotherapy musculoskeletal service and characterise the prevalence of distress. To achieve this, self-report questionnaires were embedded within informatics associated with the Integrating Mental and Physical Health Research and Training (IMPARTS) programme to assess: depression, anxiety, risk of persistent disability secondary to back pain, fear avoidance beliefs, pain catastrophizing and pain self-efficacy. A secondary aim was to develop associated care pathways to guide physiotherapist decision making. These include group physical exercise, psychologically informed physiotherapy, Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT), Accident & Emergency (A&E) or letter to the General Practitioner (GP). Results: 23 % of people attending were screened during the first 3 months; of 406 screened, 14 % were identified as having probable major depression and 18 % as having probable anxiety disorder. Of the 121 patients using the developed care pathway, 68 % (N = 82) were allocated to group exercise or IAPT for symptoms of depression or anxiety, and 32 % (N = 39) had severe levels of depression and or suicidal ideation and required a letter to the GP or A&E. Just over one third of those screened reported back pain as the primary reason for attendance. Of those, 40 % scored at high risk of persistent pain-related disability. Conclusion: physiotherapy musculoskeletal service redesign to incorporate a systematic approach to identifying psychosocial risk factors in people with MSDs has highlighted the prevalence of comorbid distress. The need for physiotherapists to expand their approach and integrate psychologically-informed practices into consultations is paramoun...|$|R
40|$|Pain during {{childhood}} and adolescents is prevalent and longstanding pain can have severe consequences for children, {{their families and}} in the long run for the society. Persisting pain influences many aspects of life and pain-related disability is often associated with impairment, decreased health-related quality of life, school functioning, participation in social life, emotional well-being, and with increased healthcare utilization. The overall aim was to explore, with cross-sectional design, pain conditions, to identify biopsychosocial determinants and their association with pain-related disability, and to study the feasibility of applying a behavioral medicine treatment for adolescents experiencing musculoskeletal pain using randomized controlled design and multimethod approach. Samples of children and adolescents and their parents seeking primary care physical therapy for a pain condition, and a sample of treating physical therapists were included. The results showed that some children had profiles of biopsychosocial determinants that could increase the risk for long-term pain-related disability. Many had long pain duration and multiple pain locations. Girls reported higher levels of catastrophizing compared to boys, who in turn used more behavioral distraction generally regarded as a positive coping strategy. Behavioral medicine treatment, based on a biopsychosocial approach, targeting adolescents with pain was shown to be feasible for use in primary care, with promising outcomes. Tailoring of the treatment was suboptimal but the effect of behavioral medicine treatment in pain-related disability exceeded the effect of the control treatment. The satisfaction with treatment content and results were high for both the control- and experimental condition, significantly higher for the experimental condition as rated by participants. Learning and delivering the behavioral medicine intervention was perceived challenging but rewarding by the treating physical therapists. The biopsychosocial approach in tailoring the treatment, and dialogs with parents were identified as key aspects in the behavioral medicine treatment program. In conclusion, in children seeking primary care for pain, the factors associated with pain-related disability were complex and interrelated. The findings highlight the importance for primary care health care providers to apply a <b>biopsychosocial</b> approach in <b>assessment</b> and treatment, for improvement of activities and participation, and thereby helping children and adolescents regain health...|$|R
