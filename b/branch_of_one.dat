Pierre de Polignac, {{member of a}} cadet <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of France's most renowned ducal families, noble {{since at least the}} 12th century, duke in 1780, peer in 1817, and a descendant of Marie Antoinette's favourite, Yolande de Polastron, duchesse de Polignac), he changed his name and coat of arms to those borne by the House of Grimaldi by Monegasque ordinance issued on 18 March 1920 the day before his wedding. He had become a subject of the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, also by Monegasque ordinance, on 29 February 1920. From the date of the religious wedding the court of Monaco referred to him, jure uxoris, as Duke of Valentinois. That title had been conferred upon his wife as heiress presumptive on 20 May 1919. His surname and arms were altered by Monegasque ordinance shortly after he became a Monegasque citizen to ensure that his dynastic issue would bear the surname of Grimaldi in compliance with Article I of Monaco's house law). Pierre remained in succession to the French title of Duke of Polignac, as do his legitimate male-line descendants.|$|E

At the end of that time there was a brief struggle, and then a deep silence; and the body of the traitor swung from a <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the trees, with a paper pinned on his breast: ...|$|E
60|$|In such a town, {{it usually}} happens, that the Sheriff-clerk, {{especially}} supposing him agent for several lairds {{of the higher}} order, is possessed {{of one of the}} best-looking houses; and such was that of Mr. Bindloose. None of the smartness of the brick-built and brass-hammered mansion of a southern attorney appeared indeed in this mansion, which was a tall, thin, grim-looking building, in the centre of the town, with narrow windows and projecting gables, notched into that sort of descent, called crow-steps, and having the lower casements defended by stancheons of iron; for Mr. Bindloose, as frequently happens, kept a <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the two national banks, which had been lately established in the town of Marchthorn.|$|E

60|$|The {{song was}} coming from quite {{the other side of}} the Old Orchard from where Bully and Mrs. Bully had set up housekeeping. Peter hurried over. He found Mr. Wren right away, but at first saw nothing of Jenny. He was just about to ask after her when he caught sight of her with a tiny stick in her bill. She snapped her sharp little eyes at him, but for once her tongue was still. You see, she couldn't talk and carry that stick at the same time. Peter watched her and saw her {{disappear}} in a little hole in a big <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the old apple-trees. Hardly had she popped in than she popped out again. This time her mouth was free, and so was her tongue.|$|E
60|$|This intrepid man, George Thurston, died an ignoble death. The brigade was in camp, with {{headquarters}} in {{a grove of}} immense trees. To an upper <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of these a venturesome climber had attached the two ends of a long rope and made a swing with a length of not less than one hundred feet. Plunging downward from a height of fifty feet, along the {{arc of a circle}} with such a radius, soaring to an equal altitude, pausing for one breathless instant, then sweeping dizzily backward--no one who has not tried it can conceive the terrors of such sport to the novice. Thurston came out of his tent one day and asked for instruction in the mystery of propelling the swing--the art of rising and sitting, which every boy has mastered. In a few moments he had acquired the trick and was swinging higher than the most experienced of us had dared. We shuddered to look at his fearful flights.|$|E
60|$|Delighted {{with this}} success, he {{immediately}} cut with his knife, a <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> {{of the hardest}} trees he could find, and formed it into an axe-handle. Some of Pauline's cord he tied round the middle of this, and then split it at one end, using his flint for the purpose, and a stone for a hammer. The split extended {{only as far as}} the cord, and he forced it open by means of little stones as wedges until it was wide enough to admit the thick end of his flint axe-head. Using a piece of soft stone as a pencil, he now marked the form of the flint, where it touched the wood, exactly, and worked at this with his knife, as patiently as a Chinaman, for several hours, until the wood fitted the irregularities and indentations of the flint to a nicety. This of itself caused the wood to hold the flint-head very firmly. Then the wedges were removed, and when the handle was bound all round the split part with cord, and the flint-head enveloped in the same, the whole thing became like a solid mass.|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, {{the mere}} attempt at {{arrangement}} must be useful, even {{where it does}} nothing more than develop difficulties. Perhaps the greatest fault of men of learning is their so often supposing all other branches of science dependent upon or inferior to their own best beloved branch; and the greatest deficiency of men comparatively unlearned, their want of perception of the connection of the branches with each other. He who holds the tree only by the extremities, can perceive nothing but the separation of its sprays. It must always be desirable to prove to those the equality of rank, to these the closeness of sequence, {{of what they had}} falsely supposed subordinate or separate. And, after such candid admission of the co-equal dignity of the truly noble arts and sciences, we may be enabled more justly to estimate the inferiority of those which indeed seem intended for the occupation of inferior powers and narrower capacities. In Appendix 14, following, some suggestions will be found as to the principles on which classification might be based; but the arrangement of all the arts is certainly not a work which could with discretion be attempted in the Appendix to an essay on a <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "About {{a hundred}} altogether," [...] said Dale. [...] "They're pretty well shaded by the spruces, {{but they get}} the {{sunlight}} from east an' south. These little trees all {{came from the same}} seedlings. They're all the same age. Four of them stand, say, ten feet or more high an' they're as large around as my wrist. Here's one that's largest. See how full-foliaged he is--how he stands over most of the others, but not so much over these four next to him. They all stand close together, very close, you see. Most of them are no larger than my thumb. Look how few branches they have, an' none low down. Look at how few leaves. Do you see how all the branches stand out toward the east an' south--how the leaves, of course, face the same way? See how one <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> tree bends aside one from another tree. That's a fight for the sunlight. Here are one--two--three dead trees. Look, I can snap them off. An' now look down under them. Here are little trees five feet high--four feet high--down to these only a foot high. Look how pale, delicate, fragile, unhealthy! They get so little sunshine. They were born with the other trees, but did not get an equal start. Position gives the advantage, perhaps." ...|$|E
6000|$|We linger too long, no doubt, beside this paltry rivulet of {{life that}} flowed through the garden of the Pyncheon House. But we deem it pardonable to record these mean {{incidents}} and poor delights, because they proved so greatly to Clifford's benefit. They had the earth-smell in them, and contributed to give him health and substance. Some of his occupations wrought less desirably upon him. He had a singular propensity, for example, to hang over Maule's well, {{and look at the}} constantly shifting phantasmagoria of figures produced by the agitation of the water over the mosaic-work of colored pebbles at the bottom. He said that faces looked upward to him there,--beautiful faces, arrayed in bewitching smiles,--each momentary face so fair and rosy, and every smile so sunny, that he felt wronged at its departure, until the same flitting witchcraft made a new one. But sometimes he would suddenly cry out, [...] "The dark face gazes at me!" [...] and be miserable the whole day afterwards. Phoebe, when she hung over the fountain by Clifford's side, could see nothing of all this,--neither the beauty nor the ugliness,--but only the colored pebbles, looking as if the gush of the waters shook and disarranged them. And the dark face, that so troubled Clifford, was no more than the shadow thrown from a <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the damson-trees, and breaking the inner light of Maule's well. The truth was, however, that his fancy--reviving faster than his will and judgment, and always stronger than they--created shapes of loveliness that were symbolic of his native character, and now and then a stern and dreadful shape that typified his fate.|$|E

60|$|Prince Francesco Caraccioli, {{a younger}} <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the noblest Neapolitan families, escaped {{from one of}} these castles before it capitulated. He was {{at the head of}} the marine, and was nearly seventy years of age, bearing a high character, both for {{professional}} and personal merit. He had accompanied the court to Sicily; but when the revolutionary government, or Parthenopean Republic, as it was called, issued an edict, ordering all absent Neapolitans to return on pain of confiscation of their property, he solicited and obtained permission of the king to return, his estates being very great. It is said that the king, when he granted him this permission, warned him not to take any part in politics; expressing at the same time his own persuasion that he should recover his kingdom. But neither the king, nor he himself, ought to have imagined that, in such times, a man of such reputation would be permitted to remain inactive; and it soon appeared that Caraccioli was again in command of the navy, and serving under the republic against his late sovereign. The sailors reported that he was forced to act thus; and this was believed, till it was seen that he directed ably the offensive operations of the revolutionists, and did not avail himself of opportunities for escaping when they offered. When the recovery of Naples was evidently near, he applied to Cardinal Ruffo, and to the Duke of Calvirrano, for protection; expressing his hope that the few days during which he had been forced to obey the French would not outweigh forty years of faithful services; but perhaps not receiving such assurances as he wished, and knowing too well the temper of the Sicilian court, he endeavoured to secrete himself, and a price was set upon his head. More unfortunately for others than for himself, he was brought in alive, having been discovered in the disguise of a peasant, and carried one morning on board Lord Nelson's ship, with his hands tied behind him.|$|E
