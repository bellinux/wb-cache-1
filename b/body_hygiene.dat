50|$|Excessive <b>body</b> <b>hygiene</b> {{of the ear}} canals {{can result}} in {{infection}} or irritation. The ear canals require less <b>body</b> <b>hygiene</b> care than {{other parts of the}} body, because they are sensitive, and the body system adequately cares for these parts. Most of the time the ear canals are self-cleaning; that is, there is a slow and orderly migration of the skin lining the ear canal from the eardrum to the outer opening of the ear. Old earwax is constantly being transported from the deeper areas of the ear canal out to the opening where it usually dries, flakes, and falls out. Attempts to clean the ear canals through the removal of earwax can actually reduce ear canal cleanliness by pushing debris and foreign material into the ear that the natural movement of ear wax out of the ear would have removed.Excessive application of soaps, creams, and ointments can also adversely affect certain of the natural processes of the skin. For examples, soaps and ointments can deplete the skin of natural protective oils and fat-soluble content such as cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), and external substances can be absorbed, to disturb natural hormonal balances.|$|E

50|$|When amoebae {{inside the}} bowel of an {{infected}} person {{are ready to}} leave the body, they group together and form a shell that surrounds and protects them. This group of amoebae {{is known as a}} cyst, which is then passed out of the person's body in the feces and can survive outside the <b>body.</b> If <b>hygiene</b> standards are poor — for example, if the person does not dispose of the feces hygienically — then it can contaminate the surroundings, such as nearby food and water.If another person then eats or drinks food or water that has been contaminated with feces containing the cyst, that person will also become infected with the amoebae. Amoebic dysentery is particularly common in parts of the world where human feces are used as fertilizer.After entering the person's body through the mouth, the cyst travels down into the stomach. The amoebae inside the cyst are protected from the stomach's digestive acid. From the stomach, the cyst travels to the intestines, where it breaks open and releases the amoebae, causing the infection. The amoebae can burrow into the walls of the intestines and cause small abscesses and ulcers to form. The cycle then begins again.|$|R

50|$|Hygiene is {{a concept}} related to cleanliness, health and medicine, {{as well as to}} {{personal}} and professional care practices related to most aspects of living. In medicine and in home (domestic) and everyday life settings, hygiene practices are employed as preventative measures to reduce the incidence and spreading of disease. In the manufacture of food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and other products, good hygiene is a key part of quality assurance i.e. ensuring that the product complies with microbial specifications appropriate to its use. The terms cleanliness (or cleaning) and hygiene are often used interchangeably, which can cause confusion. In general, hygiene mostly means practices that prevent spread of disease-causing organisms. Since cleaning processes (e.g., hand washing) remove infectious microbes as well as dirt and soil, they are often the means to achieve hygiene. Other uses of the term appear in phrases including: <b>body</b> <b>hygiene,</b> personal hygiene, sleep hygiene, mental hygiene, dental hygiene, and occupational hygiene, used in connection with public health. Hygiene is also the name of a branch of science that deals with the promotion and preservation of health, also called hygienic. Hygiene practices vary widely, and what is considered acceptable in one culture might not be acceptable in another.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND In Indonesia, {{there is}} still a high {{prevalence}} of hookworm infection, especially in poor areas with poor sanitation. The number of helminthic diseases in Keerom Regency was about 599 cases in 2010. This number is bound to increase due to the low sanitation, hygiene and socio-economic status {{of the people in the}} regency. The children are a group at risk for contracting infections, especially intestinal worms, which affect the child’s physical growth and intelligence. The objective of this study was to determine the risk factors of hookworm diseases in elementary school students. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted on 224 elementary school students. Demographic data were obtained by questionnaire, comprising gender, parental socio-economic status, household sanitation, and personal <b>hygiene.</b> <b>Body</b> mass index was calculated by measurement of body weight and height. And hemoglobin concentration was measured using a Quick Check Hb-meter. Stool samples were microscopically examined using the Kato-Katz method. We used chi-square and logistic regression to find predictors of hookworm infections, with level of significance at p< 0. 05. RESULTS The number of hookworm infection was 6. 7 % and the risk factor of hookworm infection among elementary school students was the habit of using footwear outdoors [OR 5. 3; 95 % CI 1. 7 - 17. 7; p= 0. 004]. CONCLUSION The use of footwear outdoors was a predictor of hookworm infections in elementary school children.

40|$|Most modern {{production}} systems, {{especially in}} temperate climates, {{do not offer}} wallowing facilities to pigs and, to date, this has neither generated much concern in welfare science nor public debate on pig welfare. Nevertheless, wallowing is a natural behaviour of pigs which may be important to them. This paper systematically examines the overall importance of wallowing for pig welfare using principles developed in semantic modelling. As a first step, relevant citations were collected from the scientific literature. Secondly, since {{the importance of the}} attribute (‘wallowing’) is dependent upon the discrepancy between its best and worst levels, these levels were specified in relation to the status quo in pig husbandry, ie no pool (even during periods of overheating) and the ideal mud pool, respectively. Criteria for an ideal mud pool were formulated in terms of pool location and size, substrate, thermal conditions, <b>body</b> care and <b>hygiene.</b> Thirdly, available scientific information about wallowing was systematically described in relation to ten so-called weighting categories identified in semantic modelling (pain and illness, survival/heat stress, fitness, stress, aggression, abnormal behaviour, frustration, natural behaviour, preferences and demand). Fourthly, the welfare importance of wallowing was assessed by tentatively comparing it to several other welfare attributes, such as food, foraging substrate, social contact and non-castration. This leads to the suggestion that wallowing is important for pig welfare because of its multifaceted nature. It may even be very important when other forms of thermoregulation are sub-optimal. This paper, finally, discusses the ‘ethical room for manoeuvre’ concerning the (non-) implementation of mud pools in practice. An integrated approach is suggested to address related scientific, technological and ethical issues, because stakeholders are faced not only with scientific and technological gaps in knowledge but also with economical, ecological, food-safety and psychological barriers.

In the UK, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has set itself the target of reducing foodborne disease by 20 % by 2006. It plans to do this by improving food safety through the food chain and has formulated an action plan for the catering industry which includes training, provision of guidance materials, business support and monitoring. In Wales, the FSA and the Welsh Development Agency have jointly funded local authorities to raise the HACCP awareness of caterers. This paper reviews the approach used to raise HACCP awareness by the Local Authorities South East Wales Food Group. The Group commissioned the design, delivery and evaluation of a Hygiene and HACCP training course for caterers. Questionnaires were used to evaluate caterers’ knowledge and perceptions of, and attitudes towards, hygiene and HACCP before, during and after training. A final questionnaire was mailed out to participants several months after the training course had finished. The results show that prior to training, the understanding of HACCP, hazards, risk and risk management was low. The results also show that caterers were not hostile to this system of food hygiene management. Following training, participants showed a greater awareness of HACCP but their perceptions of risk were still low. Some participants claimed to have implemented the HACCP system in their business following training.

40|$|Swimming is unnatural {{activity}} for human beings. Unlike {{most of all}} other animals, we are not born with an instinct for swimming. However, ancient peoples who settled a long seacoasts, lakeshores, and riverfronts {{had to learn to}} swim for gathering food and for simple survival. From this necessity, recreational swimming would have developed, both as an {{activity for}} individuals and as a group social practice. In many ancien t civilizations, communal swimming and, later, bathing rituals were an integral part of society. By the nineteenth century, a growing middle class in Europe and America began to enjoy vacation time at beaches and resorts with the convenience and efficiency of the expanding network of railroads. “Taking the waters” at a seashore meant wading out into the shallows buoyed by a floating canopy to prevent sunburn and to shield against prying eyes. Not until the mid - 1800 s did special forms of attire develop for p ublic bathing. Even then, bathing costumes still closely resembled street clothing. But, such outfits were terrible weight burdens in wet, and drownings were common for the unwary. So, as more and more people began to request bathing costumes from their dressmakers, fashion styling diverged from daytime modes. Clothing for swimming, bathing, and seaside wear has been an important and influential area of fashionable dress since the late nineteenth century. The evolution of swimming and bathing costumes has been closely associated with trends in mainstream fashion and advancements in textile technology, but has also reflected broader societal attitudes about personal <b>hygiene,</b> <b>body</b> exposure, and modesty, and wheth er or not it was appropriate for women to participate in active sports.

40|$|People with urinary {{incontinence}} use adaptive daily-living strategies to help normalise {{urinary incontinence}} {{in their daily}} lives. The aims of this multi-method project were to: i) identify symptoms and situations that are the most bothersome; ii) explore strategies for daily-living self-management of persistent urinary incontinence used by community-dwelling, working-age women, retired-aged women and men. Methods To explore the perspectives {{of people who live}} with incontinence, 310 community-dwelling women and men and were surveyed and 29 participants were interviewed. The questionnaire included items related to: demographic information, activity level, severity and duration of urinary incontinence, impact on daily life, daily-living strategies, and management difficulties experienced. Interviews explored clients' perspectives on how and why they developed strategies for managing urinary incontinence. A survey of 84 continence nurse specialists was conducted to explore current best practice for client advice on daily-living self management of urinary incontinence. Results The most difficult incontinence symptoms to manage were those that: occur frequently, publicly, have social stigma, or over which there is limited control. To prevent, reduce or manage urinary incontinence episodes, participants used modifying, concealing, containing and restricting strategies applied to everyday functions including: planning, routines, toileting, using pads and aids, adjusting diet and fluids, <b>body</b> care and <b>hygiene,</b> physical activity and exercise, modifying the environment, and managing social situations. Participants distinguished between treatment and managing socially, and strategies used at home and when out. Health professional advice could be ignored, if short-term social continence could be maintained. Conclusions Understanding the strategies that women and men use to manage incontinence in their daily lives will enable nurses to assist people with urinary incontinence to develop effective daily-living continence management strategies and provide differentiated advice, based on clients' settings and activities.

40|$|A Girl Becomes a Woman (Ene Kook 1978, 1979, 1986) was {{a widely}} {{available}} publication for young girls. A {{substantial number of}} the 47 stories within this book made {{a great impact on}} teenage girls in the 1970 s and the teaching on women's <b>bodies</b> and <b>hygiene</b> was accepted as common knowledge. The text is illustrated by many stories and these stories actually appear throughout the book and not only in the passages specifically marked as such. In the book there are 47 well-formed tales with a perfectly balanced structure. The tales include certain formulas and structures which recur from story to story. According to the traditions of ethnology, the 47 narratives by Ene Kook can be categorised as exempla or cautionary tales, anecdotes and urban myths. Cautionary tales warn people about the consequences that wrong behaviour may have. These stories usually end with a moral note in which those who have behaved badly receive a just penalty, whether physical or otherwise. Anecdotes are usually based on some comic saying, which at the same time can function as the punch-line to the story. Beside well-developed anecdotes you can find other anecdote-like stories in the book where someone's utterance is the core and punch-line of the story. In these brief stories the sub-clauses may be elliptical and the stories do not contain a moral lesson. A Girl Becomes a Woman is an educational book for young women, in which folklore and medicine meet. The teaching narratives found in the educational text, supposedly from true experience, in essence remind us of folklore texts, and their intended purpose is to teach young women the gender ideologies and taboos related to the human body in the given society. The traditional art of story-telling and old narratives and the established medical truths about female body and how women should behave meet between the covers of A Girl Becomes a Woman. The joining the "high" and "low" for educational purposes and constructing coherent narratives has been done with the intention of influencing the reader. A Girl Becomes a Woman represents the norms and taboos of the society. Despite the academic inclination of the book much of the teaching has been delivered by means of taboos and traditions and gender ideologies rather than actual medical concepts. For example, the book supports the idea that menstruation and feminine sanitary products are considered to be shameful and by doing so stigmatises menstruating women. Ene Kook's text refers to two types of body - one is an ideal and neutral female body in the anatomic descriptions and the other is an extremely dirty, sexual, badly cared for, injured, or sick body of the cautionary tales. The first type of body is neutral or even sacred; it is like a pure substance, an ideal type that does not refer to any real woman. The other type of body reminds us of the grotesque body á la Bakhtin, it is a vulgar body, which has orifices and which excretes smells and fluids, it is dirty, ugly and voracious and badly cared for. While taking a closer look at Ene Kook's text, you may notice how this typical educational text establishes a certain type of power relations, presents its standpoints as unquestionable ones, pathologises natural behaviour or normal phenomena and contrasts scientific ("high") discourse with the popular ("low") one. Looking at the given book in the context of folklore texts and comparing the narratives found in the popular medical literature with folklore genres, a certain alienation effect will emerge. Through the comparison and alienation effect the similarity between the popular medical texts and traditional story telling genres can be observed. The deconstructed medical narratives will reveal their constructed structure and strong ties with the society or ideologies and the texts appear to be something more than just a handbook of hygiene and good behaviour for young girls...|$|R
