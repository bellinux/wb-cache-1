He tied the string to an ant, which walked through the seashell, stringing it all the way through. Minos then knew Daedalus was in the court of King Cocalus and demanded he be handed over. Cocalus managed to convince him to take a bath first; then Cocalus' daughters and Daedalus, with Minos trapped in the bath, scalded him to death with boiling water.|$|E
25|$|The {{asymptotic}} computational {{complexity of}} these algorithms may be misleading, {{because they can}} only be run on inputs of very small size. In a 1991 comparison, Hoon Hong estimated that Collins' doubly exponential procedure would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> a problem whose size is described by setting all the above parameters to 2, {{in less than a}} second, whereas the algorithms of Grigoriev, Vorbjov, and Renegar would instead take more than a million years. In 1993, Joos, Roy, and Solernó suggested that {{it should be possible to}} make small modifications to the exponential-time procedures to make them faster in practice than cylindrical algebraic decision, as well as faster in theory. However, as of 2009, it was still the case that general methods for the first-order theory of the reals remained superior in practice to the singly exponential algorithms specialized to the existential theory of the reals.|$|E
25|$|In {{computational}} complexity theory, computer algorithms of exponential complexity {{require an}} exponentially increasing amount of resources (e.g. time, computer memory) {{for only a}} constant increase in problem size. So for an algorithm of time complexity 2x, if a problem of size x=10 requires 10 seconds to complete, and a problem of size x=11 requires 20 seconds, then a problem of size x=12 will require 40 seconds. This kind of algorithm typically becomes unusable at very small problem sizes, often between 30 and 100 items (most computer algorithms need to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> much larger problems, up {{to tens of thousands}} or even millions of items in reasonable times, something that would be physically impossible with an exponential algorithm). Also, the effects of Moore's Law do not help the situation much because doubling processor speed merely allows you to increase the problem size by a constant. E.g. if a slow processor can solve problems of size x in time t, then a processor twice as fast could only solve problems of size x+constant in the same time t. So exponentially complex algorithms are most often impractical, and the search for more efficient algorithms is one of the central goals of computer science today.|$|E

500|$|The Witness is {{a puzzle}} {{adventure}} game, {{experienced in the}} first-person view. The player, as an unnamed character, explores an island with numerous structures and natural formations. The island is roughly divided into eleven sections, arranged around a mountain that represents the ultimate goal for the player. Within each section is a gold box that must be reached to activate it, requiring the player to complete a sequence of puzzles within that section to reach it. Once activated, a turret emerges from the box and shines a light towards {{the top of the}} mountain, indicating that section is complete. The player needs to activate some of the boxes in the game to be able to access the inside of the mountain and ultimately reach the game's final goal, though additional puzzles can be discovered if all eleven turrets are activated. There are additional optional puzzles scattered around the island. One optional set of puzzles, accessible after entering the mountain and colloquially referred to as [...] "The Challenge", is a time-based test to complete about a dozen algorithmically-generated mazes within seven minutes, set to music from Edvard Grieg's [...] "Anitra's Dance" [...] and [...] "In the Hall of the Mountain King".
