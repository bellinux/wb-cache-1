5000|$|US and Canadian T-Bills (short term Government debt) have a {{different}} calculation for interest. Their interest is calculated as (100 &minus; P)/P where P is the price paid.

The gsmSCF could also monitor the status of a call for certain events (call connection and disconnection), and take appropriate action on being informed of the event. Phase 1 was defined as part of Release 96 in 1997.|$|R

In the Dempster–Shafer theory, the pieces of evidence collected by a source are summarized by basic belief assignments (bbas). In this article, we propose to mine singular sources by analyzing the conflict between their corresponding bbas. By viewing the conflict as a function of parameters <b>called</b> <b>discounting</b> rates, new developments are obtained and a criterion that weights the contribution of each bba to the conflict is introduced. The efficiency and the robustness of this criterion is demonstrated on several sets of bbas with various specificities...|$|R
