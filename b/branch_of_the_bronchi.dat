50|$|The bronchioles or bronchioli are the passageways {{by which}} air {{passes through the}} nose or mouth to the alveoli (air sacs) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lungs, in which {{branches}} no longer contain cartilage or glands in their submucosa. They are <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bronchi,</b> and are part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conducting zone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respiratory system. The bronchioles divide further into smaller terminal bronchioles which {{are still in the}} conducting zone and these then divide into the smaller respiratory bronchioles which mark <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respiratory region.|$|R
40|$|Now that systemic-pulmonary {{collateral}} arteries {{are used}} for unifocalization in patients with pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect, the question arises whether morphologic criteria of these collateral arteries could help to provide better results. In an attempt to classify <b>the</b> morphologic features <b>of</b> systemic-pulmonary collateral arteries, we studied 31 heart-lung autopsy specimens with pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect. <b>The</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systemic-pulmonary collateral arteries (origin, branching pattern, and connections with systemic and central pulmonary arteries) was related to their histologic characteristics. The results show that systemic-pulmonary collateral arteries cannot be classified according to their course related to the trachea and <b>the</b> main <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bronchi.</b> <b>The</b> histologic features <b>of</b> these collateral arteries vary along their course to the lungs. Nearly all systemic-pulmonary collateral arteries contain a muscular or a musculoelastic segment. One type of collateral artery (complex loop anastomoses) is completely muscular and resembles a bronchial artery. Nutritive branches (bronchial arteries) arise from all histologic types of systemic-pulmonary collateral artery segments. The size and number of intimal proliferations in muscular, elastic, and musculoelastic segments did not differ significantly. In 29 of 31 cases a ductus arteriosus did not coexist with large collateral arteries (two cases unknown). It is concluded that a classification of large systemic-pulmonary collateral arteries based on morphologic features results in a highly variable system, which does not facilitate decisions for <b>the</b> suitability <b>of</b> these arteries for unifocalization procedures. <b>The</b> variability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systemic-pulmonary collateral arteries corresponds with the recent embryologic finding that during development, collateral artery formation is possible during extended periods...|$|R

40|$|Based upon ultrastructural {{findings}} and computed tomography, a presumptive diagnosis of feline primary ciliary dyskinesia {{was made in}} a 2. 5 -year-old cat. The cat demonstrated morphologic alterations in <b>the</b> ultrastructure <b>of</b> oviductal cilia. In the oviduct, axonemal abnormalities were detected in 132 (20 %) of 660 cross-sectioned cilia. The main ultrastructural ciliary defects were a lack of central microtubules, transposition of peripheral doublets to <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> axoneme, supernumerary microtubules, and morphologic abnormalities of peripheral doublets. Computed tomography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chest was consistent with early lesions of bronchiectasis, suggesting chronic stagnation of respiratory secretions, attributed to abnormal function of respiratory cilia. Specifically, <b>the</b> cranial <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cat's <b>bronchi</b> were wider and thicker than those of five healthy controls. Foci of pleural thickening and interstitial enlargement were also observed...|$|R
50|$|The Intrapulmonary nodes or Lymphatic Vessels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lungs {{originate}} in two plexuses, a superficial and a deep. The superficial plexus is placed beneath the pulmonary pleura. The deep accompanies <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pulmonary vessels and <b>the</b> ramifications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bronchi.</b> In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger <b>bronchi</b> <b>the</b> deep plexus {{consists of two}} net-worksâ€”one, submucous, beneath the mucous membrane, and another, peribronchial, outside <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bronchi.</b> In <b>the</b> smaller <b>bronchi</b> there is but a single plexus, which extends {{as far as the}} bronchioles, but fails to reach the alveoli, in <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> which there are no traces <b>of</b> lymphatic vessels. <b>The</b> superficial efferents turn around <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lungs and <b>the</b> margins <b>of</b> their fissures, and converge to end in some glands situated at the hilus; the deep efferents are conducted to the hilus along the pulmonary vessels and bronchi, and end in the tracheobronchial lymph nodes.
