40|$|The Poverty Analysis Macroeconomic Simulator (PAMS) is a {{model that}} links {{standard}} household surveys with macro frameworks. It allows users to assess the effect of macroeconomic policies-in particular, those associated with Poverty Reduction Strategies papers-on sectoral employment and income, the incidence of poverty, and income distribution. PAMS (in Excel) has three interconnected components: o A standard aggregate macro-framework {{that can be taken}} from any macro-consistency model (for example, RMSM-X, 123) to project GDP, national accounts, the national budget, the BoP, price levels, and so on, in aggregate consistent accounts. o A labor market model breaking down labor categories by skill level and economic sectors whose production total is consistent with that of the macro framework. Individuals from the household surveys are grouped in representative groups of households defined by the labor category of the head of the household. For each labor category, labor demand depends on sectoral output and real wages. Wage income levels by economic sector and labor category can thus be determined. In addition, different income tax rates and different levels of budgetary transfers across labor categories can be added to wage income. o A model that uses the labor model results for each labor category to simulate the income growth for each individual inside its own group, assumed to be the average of its group. a abstr After projecting individual incomes, PAMS calculates the incidence of poverty and the inter-group inequality. PAMS can produce historical or counterfactual simulations of: o Alternative growth scenarios with different assumptions for inflation, fiscal, and current account balances. These simulations allow test tradeoffs within a macro stabilization program. o Different combinations of sectoral growth (agricultural or industrial, tradable or non-tradable goods sectors), within a given aggregate GDP growth rate. o Tax and <b>budgetary</b> <b>transfer</b> policies. For example, PAMS will simulate a baseline macro-scenario for Burkina Faso corresponding to an existing IMF/World Bank-supported program and introduce changes in tax, fiscal, and sectoral growth policies to reduce poverty and inequality more effectively than the base scenario. So, the authors argue that there are several possible"equilibria"in terms of poverty and inequality within the same macro framework.

According to the World Bank, between 1996 and 2007, more than 40 water and sanitation service provision contracts have been awarded to private or mixed companies in Colombia, serving a combined population of 7.3 million or more than 20% of the urban population. According to the Colombian water regulator, there were even more public-private partnerships for water and sanitation in Colombia in 2004: 125 private and 48 mixed public-private water companies, including large, medium and small companies. Most of the contracts were awarded in poor municipalities with highly deteriorated infrastructure. They relied mainly on public funding, complemented by limited private funding. The design was based on the central government providing grants in the start-up years to rehabilitate deteriorated systems and to expand access, while the contracting municipal governments also made <b>budgetary</b> <b>transfers</b> on an annual basis to complement revenues.

The auter's calculations - which provide, along the way, estimates regarding the total sum of public expenses incurred by French territorial administrations from 1815 to 1939 - lead to reduction of the paradox between, on the one hand, what some historians have described as continuity in the process of elimination of illiteracy and in the system of public assistance throughout the period in question and, on the other hand, the more customary notion according to which the Troisième République invented education and social assistance, a notion based only on thejudical and financial orms assumed by the central State upon the Troisième Republiqueis establishment.

40|$|At the end {{of every}} European Union {{accession}} negotiation, there is a fight about finance. Yet finance {{is by no means the}} most important element of the negotiations. Matters affecting the vital interests of new and old members like the free movement of labour or the representation of the new member state in the institutions of the Union are usually far more important in the longer term. But it is easier for politicians to talk to voters about money than about policy. The budgetary negotiations in this first enlargement to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe were perhaps more important in that these are relatively poor countries compared to the Union average per capita gross domestic product. They all will have to invest heavily in transport and environmental infrastructure in the coming decades in order to catch up with the standards of the EU- 15 and support higher economic growth and development. Assuming responsible macro-economic policy in the new member states, EU <b>budgetary</b> <b>transfers</b> can speed up this investment process considerably, allowing these countries to catch up with the old member states in terms of per capita income more quickly. Higher transfers to the new member states means of course larger net budgetary contributions for the old member states (EU- 15). This comes at a time when budget deficits are high and rising throughout the EURO-zone and when member states are making politically controversial cuts in social spending. The fiscal discipline involved in membership of the monetary union and implementation of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines therefore means that the existing member states of the Union are not keen to see their net budgetary position with Brussels deteriorate or even their gross contributions to the budget rise.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to present an overview of the Slovenian food industry economic development in the period before the Slovenian EU accession and the first five years of the EU membership. The accession to the EU was certainly the most comprehensive change of economic environment since the state gained its independence. Nevertheless, already during the pre-accession period the changes intensified restructuring processes and increased pressures to the business performance of the sector. The agro-food industrial complex, however, is among the sectors of the acceding economies for which EU enlargement traditionally brings the most radical changes. Price level and cost differences, hardly comparable production structures, but mostly disparities in types and comprehension of the economic policies required large adjustments and caused notable economic pressures. Based on a framework of economic indicators the paper tries to answer some of the most recurrent questions related to the restructuring process of Slovenian food industry in the last decade. First we present past sectoral business performance using the appropriate mezzo-economic accountancy indicators, whereas in the central part of the paper four key restructuring determinants are analysed and commented. The determinants are formulated into the four relevant questions dealing with cost-price developments, relations in the Slovenian agro-food chain, developments of the international trade and trends in the <b>budgetary</b> <b>transfers</b> to support competitiveness. Results confirm that the economic restructuring which had been hindered in the Slovenian food industry during the last decade has been triggered radically after EU accession. This brought to the termination of favourable economic conditions in the highly protected domestic market and deteriorated radically the business performance, and only those food companies which will restructure proactively will sustain in the EU markets...|$|R
40|$|Subnational fiscal autonomy-the {{basis for}} fiscal {{federalism}} in modern federations-is meant to serve two roles. First, local control over revenue collection is meantto provide {{a check on}} the capacity of central authorities to tax arbitrarily local capital. Second, retention of taxes raised locally is meant to establish incentives for subnational governmental authorities to foster endemic economic growth as a way of promoting local tax bases. But in the Russian Federation, fiscally autonomous regions have often resisted market-oriented reforms, the enactment of rules protecting private property, and the dismantling of price controls and barriers to trade. The authors find statistical evidence in support of the hypothesis that fiscal incentives of the Russian regions represent an important determinant of regional economic performance. The authors also seek to understand the conditions under which fiscal autonomy prompts regional growth and recovery, and the conditions under which it has adverse economic effects. They argue that the presence of"unearned"income streams-particularly in the form of revenues from natural resource production or from <b>budgetary</b> <b>transfers</b> from the central government-has turned regions dependent on these income sources into"rentier"regions. As such, governments in these regions have used local control over revenues and expenditures to shelter certain firms (natural resource producers or loss-making enterprises) from market forces. Using new fiscal data from 80 Russian regions from 1996 - 99, the authors test this central hypothesis in both single- and simultaneous-equation specifications. Their results indicate that tax retention (as a proxy for fiscal autonomy) has a positive effect on the cumulative output recovery of regions since the breakup of the Soviet Union. But they also find that this effect decreases as rentable income streams to regions increase.

If we were simply assessing the annual (and strictly notional) contribution from Scotland {{to the rest of the}} UK of its share of the UK defence budget it would be appropriate to take some ratio of Scotland to the UK and apply it to the defence budget. This has been the practice in the past and the most popular Scottish ratio appears to be that of its population as a percentage of the UK's, though others have been suggested (such as the ratio of Scottish GDP, or personal income). On a population basis the Scottish 'share' of UK defence expenditure would be in the order of £ 1 billion a year, or just under 10 %. However, such attributed ratios have a strictly limited value in that their choice is arbitrary - one ratio compared to another could produce shares varying by many tens of millions of pounds - and their economic meaning is unclear.

The study results reveal that no major shifts in production and farm structure took place in the region in the study period, however, some expansion of WB agricultural trade, which are mainly a result of stronger exports, are reported. All study countries have prepared and most have also adopted a new strategic framework for the future of agricultural policies with more elaborated focus on EU harmonisation process. However, there were not observed pronounced changes in the actual structure and the volume of <b>budgetary</b> <b>transfers</b> related to agricultural policies in the region in the study period 2013 - 2015. Compared with the support granted under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in EU, the total budgetary support in WBs is still relatively low.

The type of direct payments and supported sectors are under constant adjustment. However, the policy instruments' alignment of WB countries to CAP-like policy is limited. As a general rule, agricultural budgets are not development-oriented. The institutional limitations in the implementation of the IPARD pre-accession support, the lack of clear action plans for policy reforms and the absence of the evidence based policy approach to policy-making are a few areas constraining a better design and implementation of agricultural policies in WB and for which policy recommendations and future tasks are outlined in this studyJRC.

Social welfare payments, such as unemployment benefits, child allowances, old age pensions and minimum income support, were expanded continuously, until they formed a major <b>budgetary</b> expenditure. These <b>transfer</b> payments compensated, to a large extent, for the continuous growth of income inequality, which had moved Israel from among the developed countries with the least income inequality to those with the most.|$|R
40|$|This {{learning}} module/handbook {{explains the}} rationale behind school-based budgeting (SBB) [...] the transfer of authority and responsibility for allocating a portion of school operating funds from the central school district to individual schools [...] and suggests practical implementation strategies. According to part I, SBB comes in many forms. Each school gets a "global, " "block, " or "lump-sum " budget (ranging from 2 to 90 percent of total expenditures) to allocate across various functions or for types of goods and services. Part II explains SBB's relationship to continuous quality improvement [...] the juxtaposition of clear purposes and goals for improvement with wisely allocated resources. Part III discusses the superiority of decentralized budgeting systems over traditional centralized systems. Part IV discusses whether school-based budgeting works. Part V outlines a three-tiered system for <b>transferring</b> <b>budgetary</b> authority and responsibility, showing how five educational systems decentralize responsibilities. Part VI explains how to develop SBB decision-making processes, and part VII offers three SBB models with explanatory tables. Part VIII outlines three activities to help practitioners improve understandings of SBB. Two appendices list 23 references and explain the Quality Schools Project.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} issues and problems of the Åland Islands related to European integration and globalisation. These are migration (essay 1), competition in the domestic (local) market of Åland (essays 2 and 3), and the economy-wide consequences of changes in shipping and alcohol policy in the Nordic countries and in the European Union (essay 4). The analyses are conducted with an econometric examination of micro level data (essays 1 and 2) and with a dynamic applied general equilibrium model (essays 3 and 4) that was constructed {{during the course of}} this study. Essay 1 examines the characteristics of migration flows to and from the Åland Islands. Estimated migration equations are well in line with the current theories and earlier empirical results. In addition, it is shown that the local unemployment rate affects mainly the migration tendency of non-natives. However, the probability of living in Åland has a decreasing time trend for native Ålanders, while the opposite is true for the persons born in mainland Finland. Essay 2 tries to explain the high price level of groceries in Åland by comparing individual price observations in Åland to those in the southwestern part of mainland Finland. Lack of scale economies, as well as high concentration levels in retailing and in the food processing industry, are some of the suggested explanations. In addition, transport costs and VAT border administration are Åland-specific, yet minor factors in raising prices. There are not many policy options available for rectifying the situation, but added competition in the local market through relaxed entry barriers could be one measure. Essay 3 introduces a dynamic imperfect competition CGE model. One of the major contributions of the model is the introduction of migration that makes economic growth endogenous in the model. An increase in the threat of entry from outside the home region is simulated with the model. This would increase the concentration of local industries, but also would increase consumer welfare. Essay 4 studies the economy-wide consequences of changes in shipping and alcohol policy of the EU and the Nordic countries. The Finnish Government’s decision to increase subsidies to shipping from 2005 onward seems to compensate quite well for the decreased profitability of tax-free sales onboard. New subsidies increase two-fold the <b>budgetary</b> net <b>transfers</b> from Finland to Åland...|$|R
