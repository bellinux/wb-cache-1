Symmetric Schottky photodiodes using different metals have varied dark current and photocurrent of several orders of magnitude. Low <b>built-in</b> <b>potentials</b> resulted in large dark current and photocurrent, while high <b>built-in</b> <b>potentials</b> caused smaller dark current and photocurrent. Two Schottky barriers reversely connecting with each other in the symmetric metal structure, which was verified by position-dependent photocurrent measurements, can explain this. In order to improve the performance of CNT-based Schottky photodiodes, asymmetric structure photodiodes using metals with high/low work functions at two contacts were fabricated. Compared to the symmetric photodiodes, asymmetric photodiodes had lower dark current and higher photocurrent. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
