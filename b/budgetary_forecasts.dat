40|$|Fiscal councils are {{independent}} public institutions aimed at promoting sustainable public finances through various functions, including public assessments of fiscal plans and performance, and the evaluation or provision of macroeconomic and <b>budgetary</b> <b>forecasts.</b> By fostering transparency and promoting {{a culture of}} stability, they can raise reputational and electoral costs of undesirable policies and broken commitments. With commitments to sustainable public finances under close scrutiny since the crisis, policymakers ’ interest in fiscal councils is growing. This paper addresses three key questions about the potential contribution of fiscal councils to fiscal credibility. What are the main characteristics of existing fiscal councils around the world? Are there specific features {{in the design and}} institutional form of fiscal councils that can enhance their effectiveness? What are the main building blocks of effective fiscal councils? The paper relies on statistical analysis based on a unique dataset of fiscal councils, and on selected case studies. The paper concludes that all else equal, fiscal councils can promote stronger fiscal discipline {{as long as they are}} well-designed. The analysis points to a number of key features of effective fiscal councils: a strict operational independence from politics, the provision or public assessment of <b>budgetary</b> <b>forecasts,</b> a strong presence in the public debate (notably through an effective communication strategy), and an explicit role in monitoring fiscal policy rules. Of course, the remit, tasks, and institutional models of fiscal councils should reflect country-specific characteristics, such as available human and financial capacities...|$|E
40|$|A hubris {{theory of}} {{entrepreneurship}} suggests that financial forecasts are often {{informed by the}} use of heuristic methods prone to overconfidence. While overconfidence can be advantageous during the start-up phase, it is also linked to overoptimistic forecasts, non-optimal outcomes and firm failure. This paper uses a data set from 203 micro and small firms operating in North West Italy where overconfidence is measured as the difference between budget estimates and actual results for Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA), owners’ equity and borrowing costs. These measures are employed to identify the extent of overconfidence by entrepreneurs in their financial forecasts and to analyse any relationship between overconfidence and the characteristics of the entrepreneur and the firm. A further probit analysis is employed to investigate any association between overconfident financial forecasts and subsequent firm failure. The results are consistent with the hypotheses, suggesting that the majority of entrepreneurs are prone to overconfident <b>budgetary</b> <b>forecasts</b> that are directly associated with firm failure. Such overconfidence is mitigated by an entrepreneur’s level of educational attainment and the use of budgetary controls...|$|E

Fiscal marksmanship, the accuracy of budgetary forecasting, can be one important piece of such information the rational agents must consider in forming expectations. Using Theil’s inequality coefficient (U) based on the mean square prediction error, the paper estimates the magnitude of errors in the <b>budgetary</b> <b>forecasts</b> in India for the period 1990 - 91 to 2003 - 04 and also decomposed the errors into biasedness, unequal variation and random components to analyze the source of error. The test of rational expectations revealed that neither revenue nor expenditure forecasts in India is rational. However, capital budget revealed more forecast errors than revenue budget. The results also revealed that degree of errors in forecasting of receipts was relatively higher than that of expenditure. However there is no specific trend in the forecasting errors, which reveals that budgetary estimates are made not based on adaptive expectations. The proportion of error due to random variation has been significantly higher (which is beyond the control of the forecaster), while the errors due to bias has been negligible. The analysis related to efficiency of forecasts also showed that no significant improvement in forecasts over time. ...|$|E

Hamad Medical Corporation, the main healthcare provider {{in the state of}} Qatar, sponsored this study to investigate the use of electronic records management as the basis for a novel information management system in its Nursing Department. To assess the viability of an electronic records management system a questionnaire survey of a representative sample of the staff and interviews with key post holders were under taken. Results obtained indicated a wide spread dissatisfaction with the existing manual system. However, introduction of any computer-based technology requires great care. To assist with identifying any issues with this technological change, Soft System Methodology (SSM) was employed to discern what changes could be made to improve the current problematic situation found in the Nursing Department. In fact the change archetypes uncovered (procedural, attitudinal, structural and cultural) formed an innovative input into obtaining a roadmap for development of the electronic staff records system. This roadmap was facilitated by the use of Nominal Group Technique (NGT) and Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) : In fact the roadmap was an ISM intent structure. The roadmap suggested that change could be affected by having written policy documents and the top goal to be achieved reflected an improvement in manpower placing and <b>budgetary</b> <b>forecasts.</b> The use of a multi-methods approach meant that as well as this study's main objectives being reached, the process encompassed some methodological innovations.

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{delivery of}} provincial budgets in Ontario and Quebec this spring provided a useful {{chance to see}} how governments of two key provinces faced with similar challenges are responding. The focus of budgets, and commentary on them, tends to be forward-looking. But before putting faith in the forward-looking elements, budget-watchers should ask what this year's numbers reveal about the reliability of budget commitments in the past. The short answer is that, in recent years, one-year-ahead <b>budgetary</b> spending <b>forecasts</b> {{have been much more}} reliable in Quebec than in Ontario. Over the past decade, both provinces have tended to spend more than projected. While Quebec’s record has improved to the point where its citizens can have some confidence that this year’s budget commitments are serious, Ontario continues to overrun its commitments by large margins. Ontarians are therefore entitled to take their government’s latest promise to control spending with a large grain of salt. Like all provinces, Ontario and Quebec are struggling with aging infrastructure and relentless pressure to spend on health. Canada’s two larges...|$|R

These institutions, created or reformed in depth in a context of large public deficits and increasing public debt-to-GDP ratios coupled with the regionalization of the Belgian state, are the result of a maturing process. The National Accounts Institute covers the positive side of the budgetary process, while the High Council of Finance deals with the normative side. Concerning the former domain, the creation of an independent institution to provide unbiased forecasts undeniably contributed to the consolidation of public finances in Belgium. In the context of the revised Stability and Growth Pact, lessons drawn from the Belgian experience can certainly be useful for other Member States willing to improve their fiscal institutional settings. Our chief recommendations for making the budgetary process successful are: institutions dealing with positive economics should enjoy a fully independent status but remain public; positive and normative issues should be completely separated from an institutional point of view; and responsibility should be shared between several strong independent institutions so as to minimize political pressure.

40|$|Predicting {{economic}} activity {{is important for}} numerous reasons. It is important for business firms because it aids in deciding how much capacity {{will be needed to}} meet future demand.

Financial market participants are forward-looking, and as a result the prices of various securities embody expectations of future economic activity. This pricing behavior implies that data from financial markets may reasonably be expected to help forecast the growth rate of the economy.

In particular, the yield curve spread between long- and short-term interest rates has received a lot of recent attention.

Sound economic fundamentals and timely and forceful policy {{responses to the}} crisis, including fiscal stimulus, contributed to rapid economic recovery in the ASEAN- 5. As growth rebounds, these economies are beginning to identify, communicate and implement their strategies for unwinding the fiscal stimulus while addressing long-term growth challenges. In this context, the paper highlights the need for fiscal policies to address infrastructure gaps, stimulate private consumption and expand social safety nets. Creating fiscal space to address these challenges will require raising revenues and reorienting public spending rather than increasing borrowing. Supporting structural reforms, aiming to stimulate private infrastructure investment, could help address long-term growth challenges, while easing the burden on fiscal policy.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this thesis was to develop and validate mathematical and statistical methods to aid informed healthcare decision making to help hospital staff, managers and policy makers {{to ensure the quality}} of elderly care {{while at the same time}} reducing the cost. As the result of the work of this thesis, holistic methods are proposed to facilitate understanding of the healthcare process dynamics and management, monitoring and performance measurement of healthcare systems. These models are illustrated and validated using three different datasets: a historical dataset on geriatric patients from an administrative database of a London hospital, a nationwide dataset available from the English Hospital Episode Statistics database on stroke- related patients, and a 5 years' retrospective dataset of stroke-related patients admitted to the Belfast City Hospital. In this thesis we first present a non-homogeneous Markov model to compute key performance measures for the whole patient care system, including both hospital and community components. We then describe different ways of modelling patients' length of stay and clustering patients into meaningful groups and a novel mixture distribution is proposed to have a significantly improved fit to length of stay data. We propose two novel techniques based on survival trees; phase-type survival trees and mixed distribution survival trees, to cluster the patients with respect to their length of stay considering the importance and effect of various patient characteristics, such as gender, age at the time of admission and disease diagnosed and their interrelation with patients' length of stay. We then illustrate how these models can be used for better understanding the care system and extracting exceptional or interesting patient pathways based on a given criterion of interest in terms of probability of occurrence, cost or duration. Based on this work, a novel application of data mining technique called sequential pattern mining is proposed to identify anomalous sequential patterns which require attention for efficiently managing scarce healthcare resources. We present two novel models for optimally scheduling patient admissions to satisfy resource restrictions, resource requirement <b>forecasting,</b> <b>budgetary</b> estimations, and/or comparing different admission scheduling strategies for a care system. First, a model based on sequential pattern mining technique, which is simple, easy to implement, has better explainability. The second model is a more sophisticated non- homogeneous discrete time Markov model and can be used for more complex admission scheduling such as a variable number of admissions each day to allocate resources to satisfy the fluctuating demand for care services or resource constraints. In addition, we describe an extension of our phase type survival tree based analysis to examine the relationship between length of stay in hospital and destination on discharge among these patient groups and illustrate applications of this approach to patient pathway prognostication, capacity planning and modelling discharge delay and its detrimental effects on length-of-stay and cost of care of patients whose discharge have been delayed. In summary this thesis proposes models to provide useful information readily available to make strategic decisions for effective care management and improvement.

40|$| and, like {{physical}} sciences, {{to want to}} go {{from the}} particular to the general seems unfruitful. The dimensions of a decision in the firm being quite difficult to apprehend, it is necessary, in a first step, to go far above reality because decisions must help the firm to come nearer and nearer to the theoritical ideal. In a second step, the managers must turn to a model which considers at the same time theory and practice. NECESSITY FOR AN OPERATIONAL MODELThe more abstract is a theory, the better it explains the essential of a phenomena {{and on the other hand}} the less it explains the detail of it. That is at the same time its force and weakness. The traditional theory gives the managers the main guide lines but is not sufficient for their concrete decisions. It is often said that conventional marginalism, concerning the allocation of resources on a market, does not help much the managers in their decisions. Coase 7 states however that « the firm is the supersession of the price mechanism » and that « the main reason why it is profitable to establish a firm would seem to be that there is a cost of using the price mechanism ». On the other hand, Peter Drucker 8 defines the main challenge of the entrepreneur as being the discovery of new possibilities. We could also state many other opinions all more or less different as the other. Admitting that the manager partially substituted the market as the key element, following the idea of Cleland, it is not allowed to go from one extreme to the other and deny that the market forces influence sometimes very much the decisions of the firms which, after all, buy the factors of production and also sell their products on the market. But fundamentally such a discussion on the exact relative importance of the market and of the manager leads nowhere since everybody recognizes decision making as the main function of the manager, and decision implies freedom of action i. e. the choice of an alternative among many. It is sure that this liberty is active within the limits determinated by the market. For example, the price of a certain hour of work goes from $ 2. 00 to $ 3. 00. That is why the manager must know the price mechanism. He must thus know that an increase in the price of a product leads to a fall in its demand. Therefore the manager needs to know how the allocation of resources on the market is done. He also needs an operational model which can be drawn from theoritical teachings but which sticks to the managerial reality and more particularly to the decision making process. ESSAY OF DEFINITIONIt is now possible to formulate a tentative definition of managerial economies: a model of optimal choice among the alternatives considered by the managers and evaluated in terms of the objective that they themselves define. The attempt may seem ventured at a time when nobody has yet defined managerial economies. This is unfortunate and perhaps explains greatly the confusion which presently exists in this field. In fact it is almost impossible to find two books dealing with the subject and using the same terms of reference. On the one hand, one will find works presenting popularization of the traditional theory, while on the other hand some authors explain techniques and methods in one or more specific areas of management. The model is an attempt to represent the links between the activities and the objective of a firm. It simplifies complex operations thus facilating its management by establishing the main significant relations. Everybody considers the decision process as being the main function of an executive. Moreover, managers must optimize their choice i. e. choose the best alternatives conducive to the achievement of the objective previously defined. Considering the fact that managers do not have perfect knowledge, it is impossible for them to inventory all the alternatives. They will rather study a few of them which seem to be the most promising. They must also evaluate the effects of the alternatives kept for study in order to facilitate the choice of the best one. It is in their interest to quantify each outcome the best they can. For planning and control to be efficient, they must compare the forecasted outcomes of a decision with its actual results: this method is called management by results. For sure the evaluation of the latter may present as many difficulties as the former. But at least the effort of evaluation leads the managers to a better preparation of their decisions, thus contributing to their improvement. Finally, the proposed definition implies that it is the responsability of the manager to finally define the objective. However, if one assumes a rational behavior on the part of the manager, he is led to accept long-run maximization as the objective of the firm. MODEL FOR IMPROVING DECISIONSSo far, it has been argued that the traditional theory offered the manager a weak help but a necessary one for their decisions, thus showing its limited validity in managerial economies. The necessity of an operational model that can be useful to the managers was also pointed out. The model for improving decisions must now be explained. Fortunately, what has been said earlier probably foresees the essential. In fact, faced with the great complexity of management, one must give up the direct application of the theory as such; but one notes at the same time the necessity of following its main guide-lines. One must therefore pass suitably from theory to practice. Nemmers 9 writes « that the typical college graduate with major in economics is, unfortunately, ill-equipped to go into business after graduation ». He proposes precisely the teaching of managerial economies which would serve as a bridge between theory and practice. Unfortunately this bridge does not exist. That is what Scitovsky 10 deplored when he spoke of the « unbridged gulf » twenty five years ago. One could probably explain its absence by the difficulty to use theory which finally leads to a set of qualitative propositions not quantifiable. The qualitative aspect of theory was mentioned in the preceding pages. What shall be done then? The manager cannot act only by intuition or with confidence to the traditional analysis. The only way to get out of the deadlock is to settle the question a little to the manner of the Gordian knot. We thus find afterwards on one side the qualitative propositions of the theory and on the other side the complex decision making process involved in the task of managing. An adequate model must fulfill in the best manner possible two fundamental requirements: to conform to theory and stick to reality. Everyone recognizes the complex, aleatory and generally uncertain character of firm management. One will never be able to apprehend all the dimensions of a decision neither will be able to predict the future so to speak. Therefore we must turn to a model which offers some chances of improving decisions. We could explain it by refering on the one hand to the definition of the firm or managers' objective and on the other hand to the evaluation of alternatives to choose in the search for the objective defined by the managers. Definition of the ObjectiveThe traditional theory only sets forth the purpose of profit maximization, obtained by equating marginal cost and marginal revenue, supposing the perfect rationality of the entrepreneur-owner. The profit could thus be maximized in a theoretical sense only if the entrepreneur fully desires it and if he possesses a complete information of all the alternatives in terms of the profit objective. Hence everybody denies the possibility of profit maximization. Many authors proposed other particular purposes aimed at by the firm such as the maximization of the sales volume or the share of the market, the satisfying profit; the firms give an increasing importance to human relations and assign large sums of money to valorize their image in the public; above all, they want to survive and maximize utility. In such a case, it is necessary to suppose, on one hand, a certain willingness on the part of the managers to act rationnally thus striving for profit maximization in the theoritical sense and, on another hand, to accept that the practice of management inevitably keeps managers away from the theoritical ideal. This process allows one to suppose that managers search for maximum profit on the long period taking into account a long series of constraints such as the survival of the firm, the share of the market, the sales volume, the variety of products, research and development, human and public relations, etc [...] However, it seems quite difficult to define profit in a way that it could be properly measured. The accounting concept is one of the best known and the most used especially because of its possibility to measure profit objectively against rules which are conveniently applied to the exploitation of a firm. The economic concept has a much more superior significance but its use is difficult and very precarious when interfirm comparisons are made because of the strongly subjective content of its measure. It seems however necessary to keep the economic concept in mind in managerial economies. First, let us say that a workable definition is in order: the increase (or loss) of the present value of future receipts during a given period represents the economic profit (or decrease) of a firm. We meet here just about the same problem as the one found when figuring out the profitability of investments. We finally get to the same idea of Peter Drucker 11 i. e. that the major challenge for the entrepreneur consists in finding and using new possibilities. In fact it is a matter of deciding to invest once and for all. But the profitability of a firm can change with time. The calculation of this profitability gives at the same time the measure of the economic profit and of the success of managers to innovate. Concerning the length of the period, it depends mainly upon the capacity of forecasting. Certain firms can trust certain predictions of five years, others of seven years and others of ten years. For example, we agree on the fact that managers plan more precisely, with greater confidence and on a longer period the needs of floor area then the sales of a particular product. On the same manner it is surely easier to estimate the demand for newspaper than for women's hat. In fact it does not seem rational for the manager to pursue another profit objective than a maximum one over a long period. Any other concept does not tend toward the optimization of decisions for there exists then an area of indetermination in the choices. So, to fix as objective a satisfying profit has two meanings: either one acts irrationnally in rejecting the best alternative in terms of profit, ceteris paribus; or one makes the optimal choice in terms of the most satisfying profit, given the limited information available. In this latter sense, the satisfying profit is the same thing as the maximum profit hereby proposed. In other words, the satisfiers' school speaks of satisfying profit when considering the impossibility of maximizing profit in the theoretical sense i. e. the impossibility to be aware of all the alternatives and to evaluate them in terms of the final objective. In addition to this, it is often said that optimal decisions are made in terms of two objectives, the short and the long period for example. However, when one wants to classify a group of objects, he would use only one criterion; also he should do the same thing when measuring an alternative against an objective. In the logics of managing which implies foreseeing in the long run, it seems to be impossible to speak of short-run objective which in this case, appears more like a <b>budgetary</b> <b>forecast.</b> To say that a sales volume is determined for the following year in a given amount can not be construe...|$|R
