40|$|Commercial parties {{continue}} to fight the <b>battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms,</b> but electronic contracting is quickly rendering this practice obsolete. In this article I assess the legal landscape for commercial parties after the <b>battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms.</b> In Section I, I briefly describe the (relatively) settled law under U. C. C. § 2 - 207. I then describe how these rules permit commercial parties to erect a force-field {{to protect themselves from}} being subjected to unwanted terms, and the developments in web-based contracting and recent case law applying contract formation principles to electronic contracting. Finally, I discuss how the growth of electronic contracting will eliminate the <b>battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> that triggers the application of U. C. C. § 2 - 207, and also will make it difficult for commercial parties to replicate the force-field protection to which they have grown accustomed. In Section II, I discuss the two primary doctrinal options available to address contracting realities for commercial parties once the electronic age of contracting has eliminated the <b>battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms.</b> The debacle surrounding Revised Article 2 suggests that the only plausible response, as the theater of operations shifts from the <b>battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> to the world of electronic contracting, will be judicial rather than legislative. Although unconscionability analysis might be a plausible doctrine to address egregious cases, I conclude that the doctrine is too closely aligned with consumer protection to make it a viable theory for commercial parties. Instead, I argue that rehabilitating the doctrine of reasonable expectations holds the most promise for addressing the commercial contracting world after the <b>battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms.</b> This approach enjoys the benefit of being grounded in Karl Llewellyn’s theory of the validity of standard form contracts, is consonant with one of the important guiding principles of Article 2, and will be sufficiently defined by the commercial context to permit consistent application by courts policing the margins of acceptable contracting practices...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{reviews the}} history of the 2 ̆ 2 <b>battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> 2 ̆ 2 issue arising when {{contracting}} parties submit conflicting terms to each other in attempting to form a contract and how courts have resolved issues arising from this, both under the original Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Article 2 and the Revised Article 2. The author reviews the economic circumstances that gave rise to the current use of standard form contracts, such as lower transaction costs and the ability of a company to control the terms and the discretion of its personnel. He discusses how <b>battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> issues were resolved before Article 2 of the UCC was adopted, using common law interpretation tools such as the 2 ̆ 2 last shot 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 mirror image 2 ̆ 2 rules. The author then reviews the motivations for implementing UCC Section 2 - 207, and surveys the problems that this section has created for the ability of courts to provide consistent resolution to <b>battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> disputes given ambiguities in the code 2 ̆ 7 s wording. He then reviews the Revised Section 2 - 207, comparing the old and new versions of the section, and discusses both how the revision may change how courts resolve <b>battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> disputes and the problems that still remain. The author ultimately proposes a more straightforward solution to the <b>battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> problem that has the advantages of the certainty provided by common law rules with the flexibility to consider the particular circumstances of a given transaction...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{game theory}} {{is applied to}} the <b>battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> and related {{scenarios}} to explain Daniel Keating’s observations, reported in the article “Exploring the <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forms</b> in Action,” 98 MICH. L. REV. 2678 (2000). The first of the two major findings in this article {{is that there is a}} game-theoretic reason drafters of boilerplate language should use adversarial, U. C. C. § 2 - 207 (1) proviso-conforming language, namely, to ensure that clients receive terms that are no worse than the default U. C. C. gap fillers. The second major finding is that there is a penalty default rule in contract law. This has been debated by academics including Ian Ayres, Robert Gertner, and Eric Posner. Under the U. C. C., consequential damages are part of the gap fillers, and thus part of the Nash Equilibrium default in the <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forms.</b> This default gap filler is applied even though a majority of parties do not include this term in their negotiated, functionally complete contracts...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{one type of}} ex-ante effect {{of the battle of}} the forms: the {{incentive}} to draft reasonable boilerplate terms. It argues that the experience with the battle-of-the-forms rule under the CISG reinforces what we already know, that existing legal solutions do not provide any incentive for the parties to draft reasonable forms. The paper suggests that the goal of inducing parties to draft reasonable terms can be significantly promoted by a third rule, a variant of the “best-shot” rule proposed by Victor Goldberg. Under the version labeled the “reasonable-shot” rule, the court would resolve the <b>battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> by choosing the form that contains the more efficient terms. The paper proposes some guidelines how the “reasonable shot” could be identified by the court, and argues that there are good reasons to expect that this regime would give parties the incentive to draft reasonable terms. In fact, it is plausible that under this rule the parties’ forms would converge and the <b>battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> would cease to exist...|$|E

40|$|Consensus and {{commercial}} terms: theoretical and comparative analysis This final thesis {{deals with the}} topic of the <b>battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> using the theoretical apparatus of rules governing the formation of contract. The problem is modeled (and therefore limited) for the case of formation of contract for the sale of goods concluded between merchants when each of them uses his/her own commercial (standard) terms. Another limitation of the thesis is connected with the use of classical contractual paradigm which is based on the continuity of offer and acceptance in the process of contracting. The key element of contract is found in consensus, therefore it is consensus which is analyzed in connection with extensiveness of terms, about which the minds have to meet in order to form the contract, and also in connection with the content of already formed contract. The final thesis has two objectives. First, it is to verify on theoretical level that no matter what principle in the process of formation of contract is used (whether mirror-image rule or not) both law professionals and legal theory are forced to find solutions which are in accordance with the principle of economic analysis of contract. Second, it is to analyze solutions on the formation and content of contract which were adopted by Czech [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This Master's thesis {{focuses on}} the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), {{better known as the}} Vienna Convention. The main purpose of this thesis is to {{evaluate}} conditions for application of this international treaty and to assess the contracting process under the CISG including the similarities and differences with the Czech national legislation. Finally, it seeks an answer to the question, which of these rules (international or national) are more advantageous for a Czech contractual party with respect to concluding a contract. The thesis is divided into five parts. The first one represents an introduction to the CISG, its origin and the Czech Republic's attitude to it. The second part identifies the conditions for application of the CISG and therefore defines a subject and an object of an international contract of sale under the CISG. Both third and fourth parts gradually introduce two phases of the contracting process (offer and acceptance) including the relevant case-law. The last chapter strives to complete the contracting process with an analysis of the exact moment, when a contract is concluded, as well as with an analysis of a potential <b>battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> and its impact on a contract conclusion...|$|E
