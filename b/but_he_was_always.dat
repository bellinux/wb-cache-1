5|$|David Cameron (Conservative {{leader and}} Prime Minister) said:... {{he was an}} {{extraordinary}} man: a great writer, a brilliant speaker, extraordinary in Parliament, and a great life of public and political and parliamentary service. I mean, I disagreed with most of what he said. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> engaging and interesting, and you were never bored when reading or listening to him, and the country a great campaigner, a great writer, and someone who I'm sure whose words will be followed keenly for many, many years to come.|$|E
5|$|Chazz Palminteri as U.S. Customs Special Agent Dave Kujan. Singer {{had always}} wanted the actor for the film, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> unavailable. The role was offered to Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, both of whom turned it down. The filmmakers even had Al Pacino come in and read for the part, but {{he decided not to}} do it because he had just played a cop in Heat. Palminteri became available, but only for a week. When he signed on, this persuaded the film's {{financial}} backers to support the film fully because he was a sufficiently high-profile star, thanks to the recent release of A Bronx Tale and Bullets Over Broadway.|$|E
25|$|Republican Senator Orrin Hatch: On the issues, we were {{frequent}} opponents, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> gracious both {{in victory}} and defeat. This {{is a man}} who earned his law degree while serving in the Senate, and who had a prodigious knowledge of ancient and modern history.|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe Flora {{promises}} {{to ask him}} if she should ever meet him in London, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> away. If ever we should be happy enough to get an active incumbent, we shall have a chance." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{whole country}} watches the manhunt on TV, some fascinated, some disgusted. Lotz tries hiding, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> recognized. Some want to deliver {{him to the}} Köhler gang, but some help him. Throughout the game, the Köhler gang <b>is</b> <b>always</b> hot on his heels.|$|R
50|$|Dua feels awkward in Zohaib's {{presence}} <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> such a gentleman, helping Dua {{with her}} heavy suitcases, putting her worries to rest about the honeymoon trip and yes getting her, her own separate room on their honeymoon. Hamza even appeared {{like a ghost}} on their honeymoon and scared Dua.|$|R
25|$|He wasn't a gregarious bloke, really. He was {{actually}} quite retiring, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> {{up for a}} bit of fun. He never seemed to take his cricket all that seriously, in that country way. Numbers didn't mean much to him. In a lot of respects he had that 'Hookesy' outlook. Why would you get eight not out in 10 overs? He couldn't understand, what's the use of that? His record suggests unfulfilled talent and I guess that's what it was to a certain extent.|$|E
25|$|He {{finally came}} to be {{respected}} {{as one of the}} most intelligent cyclists ever, but when he died in 1987 he was still to a large extent one of cycling's greatest enigmas. Raphaël Géminiani knew him better than anyone and he was such a perceptive man that his comments are particularly interesting. He said that Jacques w{{as one of the most}} gifted riders of all time but this was hardly reflected by his record. He had won eight major Tours without once crossing the top of a mountain in the lead. His lack of offensive spirit made Géminiani mad with rage on countless occasions <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> so incredibly stylish, absolute perfection.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s Clark {{pursued a}} {{conventional}} academic career while teaching history in Canberra. In 1950 he published {{the first of}} two volumes of Select Documents in Australian History (Vol. 1, 1788–1850; Vol. 2, 1851–1900, appeared in 1955). These volumes made an important contribution to the teaching of Australian history in schools and universities by placing a wide selection of primary sources, many never before published, in the hands of students. The documents were accompanied by extensive annotation and commentaries by Clark, and his critics now regard this as his best work, before the onset of what they see as his later decline. At this stage of his career Clark published as C. M. H. Clark, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> known as Manning Clark, and published his later works under that name.|$|E
6000|$|There {{were other}} anecdotes of his liveliness and agility. Then {{followed}} {{the story of}} the youngest son, known as Liddy. [...] "I don't rightly know," [...] said Caleb, [...] "what the name <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> given when they christened 'n; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> called Liddy, and nobody knowed any other name for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> all <b>he</b> wants," [...] {{the other}} said carelessly; [...] "and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> safer here than <b>he</b> would <b>be</b> in the richer quarters. There {{would be a}} plot against him, and those cursed Royalists would kill him {{if they had the}} chance; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> escorted home from the club by a band of patriots." ...|$|R
50|$|Herr Holm's {{given name}} <b>is</b> Klaus-Dieter, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> almost <b>always</b> {{referred}} to as Herr Holm.|$|R
500|$|Harrison echoed Martin's {{description}} of his stabilising role: [...] "I think we just grew through those years together, him as the straight man and us as the loonies; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> there for us to interpret our madness – {{we used to be}} slightly avant-garde on certain days of the week, and he would be there as the anchor person, to communicate that through the engineers and on to the tape." ...|$|E
500|$|Drummer Sherman Ferguson said of Ibn Ali, [...] "he was a {{prime example}} of {{somebody}} that was very avant-garde in some ways, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> musical. So people of all ages liked his music, even when he played out. [...] had that thing, where he had a natural feeling. He got to the thing where it swung no matter what he was doing." [...] Saxophonist Benny Golson commented that Ibn Ali [...] "became very skilled at the modern sounds, and then went right past them into something very esoteric. He went way out there. I guess you could say his brakes didn't work." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the official EastEnders website, Oberman detailed the background dynamic to Chrissie and Den's relationship as it existed before their appearance on the show: [...] "They were a real match for each other and ran a successful wine bar. The couple made a good team, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> going off with other women. She'd end up leaving him, but they'd always end up back together." [...] Den's womanising and philandering nature was deliberately set against Chrissie's strong and forceful personality, and culminated on-screen in his affair with Kate Mitchell (Jill Halfpenny). The plot was praised by television editor Ru Green as being one of the [...] "better storylines" [...] during an otherwise weak year for the show, with media attention at the time profiling Chrissie's dramatic plans for revenge. Commenting on the storyline's climax, a report in The Sun spotlighted how [...] "instead of collapsing in tears" [...] as many female characters in EastEnders are wont to do, Chrissie [...] "proves that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned". The climax, which saw Chrissie cut off Kate Mitchell's hair in retribution for the affair, was a highlight for Oberman and an important dramatic milestone for her character: [...] "cutting off Jill Halfpenny's hair in the salon... was a really great episode. I loved working with Jill and I think that put Chrissie on the map." ...|$|E
6000|$|Peter laughed again. [...] "He always does," [...] said he. [...] "If he didn't, <b>he</b> wouldn't <b>be</b> happy. You wouldn't {{think it}} to look at him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> happy right now. He doesn't know it, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>is</b> happy when <b>he</b> can show what a bad temper he has." ...|$|R
50|$|Ruined, Pedro discovers fraud, {{as well as}} his friend's betrayal. With his family, Pedro Luis {{tries to}} start over again, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> waiting for a chance to take revenge on Everardo Rey. Meanwhile, a deep and real love is born between Pedro's {{daughter}} Lorenza Malvido and Matías Rey, who try to ease the hatred between their families in order to be happy together in peace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, very well," [...] replied Jimfred. [...] "This is a queer freak for our Boolooroo {{to indulge}} in, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> doing {{something}} absurd. You're {{not much of}} a guard, seems to me, but if anyone tries to rob the Treasure Chamber you must ring this big gong, which will alarm the whole palace and bring the soldiers to your assistance. Do you understand?" ...|$|R
500|$|Ruth was {{sometimes}} allowed to rejoin his family, or was placed at St. James's Home, a supervised residence with {{work in the}} community, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> returned to St. Mary's. He [...] was rarely visited by his family; his mother {{died when he was}} 12 and by some accounts, he was permitted to leave St. Mary's only to attend the funeral. How Ruth came to play baseball there is uncertain: according to one account, his placement at St. Mary's was due in part to repeatedly breaking Baltimore's windows with long hits while playing street ball; by another, he was told to join a team on his first day at St. Mary's by the school's athletic director, Brother Herman, becoming a catcher even though left-handers rarely play that position. During his time there he also played third base and shortstop, again unusual for a left-hander, and was forced to wear mitts and gloves made for right-handers. He was encouraged in his pursuits by the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia. A large man, Brother Matthias was greatly respected by the boys both for his strength and for his fairness. For the rest of his life, Ruth would praise Brother Matthias, and his running and hitting styles closely resembled his teacher's. Ruth stated, [...] "I think I was born as a hitter the first day I ever saw him hit a baseball." [...] The older man became a mentor and role model to George; biographer Robert W. Creamer commented on the closeness between the two: ...|$|E
2500|$|Truesdale {{had kind}} words for his successor, Peter J. Hurtgen. [...] "He's not an ideologue," [...] Truesdale said in October 2002. [...] "He {{came from a}} {{management}} background, and I guess he himself would tell you he was a conservative Republican and a management-oriented person. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> very fair." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> very {{conscious}} of the insecurity of his social position and this may explain the extreme personal and professional recklessness which he displayed throughout his life. [...] Whether jumping into the River Mersey to rescue the drowning man, entering the Egyptian soldiers' camp or leading {{the assault on the}} walls of Zhenjiang, the impression left was that he was potentially willing to risk or even honorably sacrifice his life if the opportunity arose in order to demonstrate that he was as good as, or better, than his legitimate contemporaries.|$|E
50|$|From the beginning, Leonard's {{infatuation with}} Penny becomes {{a major force}} that drives the series. Howard also shows {{interest}} in her (primarily sexual), <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> rejected abruptly due to his unsettling approaches. Although Penny occasionally teases Raj for his inability to speak to her, she is sympathetic and kind towards him, and as with Sheldon, she almost always overlooks his idiosyncrasies and appreciates that his intentions are good.|$|R
5000|$|... "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic as Milo Murphy, {{the title}} {{character}} of the series. He {{has a reputation for}} having extreme misfortune, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> optimistic and finds ways to overcome it. He carries a backpack with him that always seems to have what he needs for any given situation. It was given to him by his old babysitter, Veronica, who was the only one able to handle Murphy's Law.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Since my recovery, his engagements with country {{patients}} have kept {{him away from}} London. I have not seen him since he took these lodgings for me. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> considerate. <b>He</b> has written more than once to beg that I will not think him neglectful, and to tell me (what I knew already through my poor husband) {{that he has no}} money of his own, and must live by his profession." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2002, rugby {{commentator}} Bill McLaren named David Campese on {{the wing}} in his greatest ever World XV, citing him as his favourite player. He further nominated Campese the greatest rugby player he ever saw. [...] "Every time David Campese got the ball people sat up and took notice, he took a risk and I love that," [...] said McLaren. [...] "He was so adventurous. Sometimes it didn't work, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> willing to try. Andy Irvine was similar, but Campese was the one. He carried the commentary along with the play." [...] In the tribute book David Campese McLaren wrote that, [...] "He and Mike Gibson of Ireland are the most complete footballers I have ever seen." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1895, Grand Duke Paul {{began an}} affair with a married woman, Olga Valerianova Pistolkors. He was able to obtain a divorce for her and he {{eventually}} married Olga in 1902, while the couple was staying abroad. As they had married defying Nicholas II’s opposition, the Tsar forbade them to return to Russia. Left fatherless, twelve-year-old Maria and eleven-year-old Dmitri moved to Moscow placed under the custody of their uncle Grand Duke Sergei and his wife, Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna, a sister of the Tsarina Alexandra. Maria and Dimitri resented their aunt and uncle, blaming them for the forced separation from their real father, who had abandoned them. Grand Duke Sergei was strict and demanding, but devoted and affectionate towards the children. Marie wrote in her memoirs: [...] "In his fashion he loved us deeply. He liked to have us near him, and gave us a good deal of his time. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> jealous of us. If he had known the full extent of our devotion to our father it would have maddened him." [...] Maria Pavlvona also commented that she could not entirely disagree with those who thought Grand Duke Sergei heartless, self-centered and cruel. Maria had a somewhat strained relationship with her aunt. Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna found difficult to relate to the children and was cold and distant towards them. The teenage Maria was described by her maternal aunt, Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna of Russia, as [...] "full of life and very jolly, but inclined to be self-willed and selfish, and rather difficult to deal with." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whether or not Lexa {{should be}} paired with Clarke was also debated, {{especially}} by {{fans of the}} Bellamy and Clarke relationship ("Bellarke"), which is canon in the books. This resulted in a rivalry between the fanbases. [...] In 2015, Sydney Bucksbaum of E! Online stated with regard to season 2, [...] "People {{who want to see}} Bellamy (Bob Morley) and Clarke (Eliza Taylor) get together—ahem, {{in every sense of the}} word—have had to suffer through a full season in which they were actually separated for pretty much the entire time." [...] Rothenberg told Bucksbaum that he was not dismissing the pairing; rather the Bellamy and Clarke romance was not yet the focus. He said the show gives indications that Bellamy and Clarke care deeply for each other, and those wanting a romance at the time should read the books. [...] "We played with the Lexa/Clarke storyline [...] and that [...] still ongoing because both characters [...] still breathing," [...] stated Rothenberg. [...] "The journey is long, and eventually we'll be able to tell that story in all its glory." [...] He said when it came to whether or not the series would end with Clarke and Lexa as a couple, he would not comment on the matter and knew where he wanted the series to go, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> open to better ideas. Eliza Taylor also weighed in on the matter, stating that she loves that bisexuality on the show is portrayed as normal, and that she also likes the chemistry between Bellamy and Clarke.|$|E
5000|$|Hines {{uses his}} left hand {{sometimes}} for accents and figures that would only come from a full trumpet section. Sometimes he will play chords {{that would have been}} written and played by five saxophones in harmony. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> the virtuoso pianist with his arpeggios, his percussive attack and his fantastic ability to modulate from one song to another as if they were all one song and he just created all those melodies during his own improvisation.|$|R
5000|$|The satirical {{magazine}} Private Eye frequently {{referred to}} him as [...] "tiny but perfect", {{not because of any}} shortness in stature, <b>but</b> because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> impeccably groomed.|$|R
50|$|During the day, Lila disappears, while David {{maintains}} the house. He lets Alice {{out of the}} crawlspace to eat and use the bathroom. Eventually, he warns Alice that Lila would kill her if she knew that Alice was still alive. David lets Alice sit with him while he works at his computer, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> careful to stash her back in the crawlspace before Lila gets home. One day, when a pair of housecleaners arrive unexpectedly, David kills them.|$|R
2500|$|By 1918, Lloyd and Roach {{had begun}} to develop his {{character}} beyond an imitation of his contemporaries. Harold Lloyd would move away from tragicomic personas, and portray an everyman with unwavering confidence and optimism. The persona Lloyd referred to as his [...] "Glass" [...] character (often named [...] "Harold" [...] in the silent films) was a much more mature comedy character with greater potential for sympathy and emotional depth, and was easy for audiences of the time to identify with. The [...] "Glass" [...] character {{is said to have}} been created after Roach suggested that Harold was too handsome to do comedy without some sort of disguise. To create his new character Lloyd donned a pair of lensless horn-rimmed eyeglasses but wore normal clothing; previously, he had worn a fake mustache and ill-fitting clothes as the Chaplinesque [...] "Lonesome Luke". [...] "When I adopted the glasses," [...] he recalled in a 1962 interview with Harry Reasoner, [...] "it more or less put me in a different category because I became a human being. He was a kid that you would meet next door, across the street, but at the same time I could still do all the crazy things that we did before, but you believed them. They were natural and the romance could be believable." [...] Unlike most silent comedy personae, [...] "Harold" [...] was never typecast to a social class, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> striving for success and recognition. Within the first few years of the character's debut, he had portrayed social ranks ranging from a starving vagrant in From Hand to Mouth to a wealthy socialite in Captain Kidd's Kids.|$|E

5000|$|Wallace usually helps Veronica out of {{feelings}} of friendship, although on occasion {{she needs to}} promise a little something extra [...] - [...] perhaps the answers to a test. Typically, he does not ask why she needs his help or {{what she is doing}} with the information he passes on to her. He trusts her almost unquestioningly. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> there for her, and Wallace is the one person Veronica truly opens up to about her rape in the episode [...] "A Trip to the Dentist." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My master has bid {{me bring}} my brother with me, Lieutenant Campbell," [...] the man said, [...] "and I have done so, but I fear greatly {{that he will}} hardly suit you as a servant. I have {{obtained}} a dozen places for him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> sent back {{at the end of}} three or four days, and I told him last time that I would never say a word in his recommendation again, for that it only gets me into trouble with the gentlemen." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{humor in}} the series arise from {{the daily lives of}} the perpetually broke young people who live away from their families, in {{situations}} at school, at work, in relationships, but involving gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender characters. [...] Khoa <b>is</b> <b>always</b> unsuccessful in love, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> looked after by his good friends. Rje and Nhật vie for the affections of BB Trần, one of Khoa's classmates, while Rje is being pursued at work by a delivery boy.
