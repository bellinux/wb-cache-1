25|$|In May 1915 a {{full-blown}} controversy was erupting, with the angels {{being used as}} proof of the action of divine providence {{on the side of}} the Allies in sermons across Britain, and then spreading into newspaper reports published widely across the world. Machen, bemused <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> attempted to end the rumours by republishing the story in August in book form, with a long preface stating the rumours were false and originated in his story. It became a bestseller, and resulted in a vast series of other publications claiming to provide evidence of the Angels' existence. Machen tried to set the record straight, but any attempt to lessen the impact of such an inspiring story was seen as bordering on treason by some. These new publications included popular songs and artists' renderings of the angels. There were more reports of angels and apparitions from the front including Joan of Arc.|$|E
25|$|Patrese didn't last much longer, his gearbox failing {{and then}} the {{stationary}} car was hit by Roberto Moreno, forcing both of them out. Piquet, who did not stop, was passed by Alesi for second with Prost taking fourth off Stefano Modena soon after. Alesi was having gearbox troubles and was holding back Piquet as Prost began to attack both of them. On lap 70, Piquet passed Alesi and Prost followed him through. Prost then shifted sides getting ahead of Piquet as well. Modena passed Alesi for fourth and Alesi soon retired with gearbox troubles. Unflustered <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> Senna won from Prost, Piquet, Modena, Satoru Nakajima and Aguri Suzuki. This {{would be the last}} Formula One Grand Prix on the streets of downtown Phoenix, Arizona and the last Formula One race in the United States for 9 years; Formula One would return to a very different part of the United States in 2000 – the historic Indianapolis Motor Speedway, that had a whole new road course built within the facility just for the Grand Prix.|$|E

25|$|Jimmy Lauderdale, on 139, {{was a bit}} puzzled <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>this.</b> But {{they were}} all new to the four-track, and he {{supposed}} it was all right. Then the signalman gave them a green flag from the box, so Lauderdale started pulling forward {{to see what he}} wanted. But the guard had spotted the down signals all off; thoroughly alarmed, he began running forward and shouting, and presently Lauderdale heard him and stopped. But it was too late then to do anything. The express was 200 yards away, coming 40 miles an hour. No. 139's crew cleared out and went over the wall, and the express went head on into 139. It was quite a bad smash. The guard and two passengers were killed. The fireman and another passenger died later. The driver escaped with severe bruising. There was very nearly another collision immediately after, for a Caley mineral from Lesmahagow was coming on the Down Goods line. Its driver saw the crash occur and managed to pull up just in time.|$|E

But somehow, {{while they were}} distracted <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> wheezing machinery, they forgot to put any actual humor in." [...] Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said [...] "'The Clash of Triton' spends way {{too much time on}} exposition, setting up the short's premise, while skimping on {{what should have been a}} priority: the jokes." [...] In his review for the DVD Verdict, Roy Hrab gave the episode's DVD a negative review and said [...] "loud noises and frantic action fill the screen to little or no purpose.

2500|$|The idea of {{a unified}} South Slavic state (typically {{expected}} to be spearheaded by independent Serbia) became a popular political ideology in the region at this time, including in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Austro-Hungarian government's decision to formally annex Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1908 (the Bosnian Crisis) added {{to a sense of}} urgency among these nationalists. The political tensions caused <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> culminated on [...] 28 June 1914, when a Young Bosnia revolutionary named Gavrilo Princip assassinated the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo. The event set off a chain of events that led to the outbreak of World War I. Although 10% of the Bosniak population died serving in the armies or being killed by the various warring states, Bosnia and Herzegovina itself managed to escape the conflict relatively unscathed.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1868 the Ottoman {{government}} further banished Bahá'u'lláh and {{his family}} to the prison-city of Acre, then part of the Syrian segment of the Ottoman Empire. As a young woman of twenty-one, Bahíyyih Khánum entered into Acre as a prisoner. This was her fourth place of exile, and her last. Despite her beauty and suitors — she was still determined to remain unmarried, and her father seemed to have advocated this. She was later respected for her choice. When arrived on the bay of Acre, the exiles were disorientated and demoralized. The populace spoke Arabic, which Bahíyyih Khánum understood, and she overheard them mocking and jeering how the family were to be thrown into the sea or imprisoned in chains. She later explained the impact this had on her: [...] "imagine, if you can, the overpowering impression made <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> upon {{the mind of a}} young girl, such as I was then. Can you wonder that I am serious, and that my life is different from those of my countrywomen?".|$|E

[...] George Seah's son told the press that although all his father wanted was an apology, the family would not reject any goodwill payments. Tan Sri Wan Suleiman Pawanteh's wife said: [...] "Although I thank the prime minister, I feel less than satisfied at his decision (not to make a straightforward apology). This {{is not the end of}} the story for me. (Without an apology) I don't know, people don't know, that my husband was not guilty. I want my husband's name to be cleared. I feel my husband was innocent. He was an honest judge...Even so, I am thankful that our prime minister cares about us enough (to do this much)." [...] Tan Sri Eusoffe Abdoolcader's granddaughter regretted that acknowledgement had been so late in coming: [...] "I wish he was here. He's the main person affected <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>this.</b> It's a different case from the others (Salleh and Wan Suleiman) because he was reinstated. It's been 12 years. It should have been solved earlier." [...] Tun Salleh Abas however welcomed Abdullah's statement, saying: [...] "I feel great. It was something I didn't expect. I suffered so much humiliation ... so much so I ran away from the public and took solace in being a farmer." ...|$|E
