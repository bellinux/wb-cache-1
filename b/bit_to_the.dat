25|$|Very high {{rotational}} speeds—30,000 to 100,000 RPM or even higher—are used; this {{translates to}} a reasonably fast linear {{speed of the}} cutting tip in these very small diameters. The high speed, small diameter, and the brittleness of the material, make the bits very subject to breaking, particularly if {{the angle of the}} <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> workpiece changes at all, or the bit contacts any object. Drilling by hand is not practicable, and many general-purpose drilling machines designed for larger bits rotate too slowly and wobble too much to use carbide bits effectively.|$|E

25|$|In a {{complete}} binary tree, a node's breadth-index (i − (2d − 1)) {{can be used}} as traversal instructions from the root. Reading bitwise from left to right, starting at bit d − 1, where d is the node's distance from the root (d = ⌊log2(i+1)⌋) and the node in question is not the root itself (d > 0). When the breadth-index is masked at bit d − 1, the bit values 0 and 1 mean to step either left or right, respectively. The process continues by successively checking the next <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right until there are no more. The rightmost bit indicates the final traversal from the desired node's parent to the node itself. There is a time-space trade-off between iterating {{a complete}} binary tree this way versus each node having pointer/s to its sibling/s.|$|E

Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara Empire defeated the last remnant of Bahmani Sultanate power after which the Bahmani Sultanate collapsed. When the Bahmani empire dissolved in 1518, its dominions were distributed into the five Muslim states of Golkonda, Bijapur, Ahmednagar, Bidar and Berar, giving rise to the Deccan sultanates. South of these, the Hindu state of Carnatic or Vijayanagar still survived; but this, too, was defeated, at the Battle of Talikota (1565) by a league of the Muslim powers. Berar had already been annexed by Ahmednagar in 1572, and Bidar was absorbed by Bijapur in 1619. Mughal interest in the Deccan also rose at this time; Ahmadnagar was partially incorporated in the Empire in 1598 and as fully in 1636, Bijapur in 1686, and Golkonda in 1688.|$|E

500|$|Following release, IGN interviewed Hiroyuki {{regarding}} {{the development of}} the game. He revealed that Camelot had received co-operation from Nintendo in relation to voice acting and animation, which Takahashi stated as [...] "contributing quite a <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> improvement of the game's graphics". Takahashi proceeded to explain why the role-playing game elements that were present in Mario Tennis were excluded from Power Tennis, stating that he felt they were more suitable for the [...] "deep single-player experience" [...] present in portable consoles. Regarding the themed courts in the game, he explained that the concepts were conceived during long brainstorming sessions, with courts selected that would both remind gamers of older Mario games and introduce new gamers to Mario games they may not have played. When questioned regarding difficulties in developing the game, Takahashi noted the effort used in making the opening sequences, developing the Special Games, and animations, which caused problems with meeting the schedule. Although there was speculation about online capabilities before release, Takahashi refrained from making the game online-compatible due to fear of lagging problems, stating [...] "I don't think you can play a tennis game online under the current Internet environment and feel satisfied".|$|E
500|$|The {{death of}} Sophia Peletier {{is a major}} {{incident}} in [...] "Pretty Much Dead Already", largely affecting the themes of the episode. After the group has shot the walkers housed in Hershel Greene's barn, Sophia appears from the barn as a walker, much to the groups' dismay. A disturbed and distraught Rick Grimes pulls out his weapon and makes the decision to shoot her. Despite being initially surprised about her character's being killed off, Madison Lintz concluded that she understood its aftermath for the show. Lintz affirmed that portraying a walker was a welcoming experience for her, and stated that she was [...] "going {{to look back on}} and say that was amazing." [...] Robert Kirkman felt that killing Sophia would add more dimension to the show, as well as add more flexibility to its storyline progression. [...] "When a good idea comes up, you have to go with it," [...] he articulated. [...] "Sophia is a character who is still alive in the comic book series and who has contributed quite a <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> overall narrative and informed a lot of story lines for a lot of different characters.

2500|$|Israel Secord House, 1337 North Avenue at Quaker Ridge Road. The {{original}} {{section of}} the house on this site {{is believed to have}} been constructed in the 1770s by Israel Secord, on land deeded to him by his father, James. During the Revolutionary War, Sir Lord William Howe, commander of British forces, made his headquarters in the Secord farmhouse before marching his troops to the Battle of White Plains, October 1776. In the rear of the home stood the “hanging tree”, an oak tree from the 1700s reportedly used to execute prisoners during the Revolutionary War. It was struck by lightning in the 1950s and subsequently cut down, though pieces of the tree were kept by area residents. [...] Although the Israel Secord farmhouse was enlarged and remodeled over the years, it still retains many of its historical elements. The farm’s cider mill is now the home at 22 Quaker Ridge Road. Records show that the land remained in the Secord family until the turn of the 20th century, when it was purchased by Charles and Regina Niehaus. Charles was a nationally recognized sculptor who created many notable sculptures in Washington; Regina became a renowned horticulturist. The farmland was sold off, bit by <b>bit,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> developers of Bonnie Crest neighborhood. From approximately 1946 to 1970, the Israel Secord House was home to Daniel F. Sheehy, a packaging executive and prominent Roman Catholic layman, his wife Ruth and their six children. During that time, the interior of the home was decorated with early American and Victorian furnishings, and quality Colonial style reproductions. During that time, more of the land was lost, especially frontage on North Avenue and Quaker Ridge Road taken by the city for road improvements. The family received several offers to sell the property for commercial development, and at one point, the City of New Rochelle considered constructing their new library on the site. The home received a 2008 New Rochelle Heritage Award.|$|E
