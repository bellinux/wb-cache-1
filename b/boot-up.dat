25|$|In September 2016, Dolphin's {{developers}} {{announced the}} emulator was {{now able to}} boot all official GameCube titles. The last title to be supported for <b>boot-up,</b> , had been particularly difficult to emulate due to the game's use of the memory management unit. Also they announced that they removed Triforce emulation, because of no maintenance in the Triforce emulation's code.|$|E
25|$|In January 2010, Lifehacker {{compared}} {{the performance of}} Firefox 3.5, Firefox 3.6, Google Chrome 4 (stable and Dev versions), Safari 4, and Opera (10.1 stable and 10.5 pre-alpha versions). Lifehacker timed how long browsers took to start and reach a page (both right after <b>boot-up</b> and after running at least once already), timed how long browsers took to load nine tabs at once, tested JavaScript speeds using Mozilla's Dromaeo online suite (which implements Apple's SunSpider and Google's V8 tests) and measured memory usage using Windows 7's process manager. They concluded that Firefox 3.5 and 3.6 were the fifth and sixth fastest browsers respectively on startup, 3.5 was third and 3.6 was sixth fastest to load nine tabs at once, 3.5 was sixth and 3.6 was fifth fastest on the JavaScript tests. They also concluded that Firefox 3.6 was the most efficient with memory usage followed by Firefox 3.5.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{applauded the}} MacBook Pro for its {{doubling}} or tripling {{the speed of}} the PowerBook G4 in some areas. For example, the 3D rendering program Cinema 4D XL was 3.3times as fast (2.3 times faster), and its <b>boot-up</b> time was more than twice as quick. The MacBook Pro generally outperformed the PowerBook G4 in performance analyzer utility tests XBench and Cinebench. Reviewers lauded the screen's maximum brightness, 67percent higher than the PowerBook G4; the excellent horizontal viewing angles; the matte options; and the bright, crisp, and true colors. Although the screen offered fewer vertical pixels (1,440×900 in the MacBook Pro instead of 1,440×960 in the PowerBook), one reviewer called the screen [...] "nothing less than stellar". Reviewers praised the new MagSafe power adapter, although one reviewer said it disconnected too easily in some instances. They also praised the backlit keyboard, large trackpad, and the virtually silent operation of the machine. The new laptop also offered better wireless performance.|$|E

50|$|The C128 {{has three}} {{operating}} modes. C128 Mode (native mode) runs at 1 or 2 MHz with the 8502 CPU and has both 40- and 80-column text modes available. CP/M Mode uses both the Z80 and the 8502 {{and is able}} to function in both 40- or 80-column text mode. C64 Mode is nearly 100 percent compatible with the earlier computer. Selection of these modes is implemented via the Z80 chip. The Z80 controls the bus on initial <b>boot-up</b> and checks {{to see if there is}} a CP/M disk in the drive, if there are any C64/C128 cartridges present, and if the Commodore key (which serves as the C64-mode selector) is being depressed on <b>boot-up.</b> Based on these conditions, it will switch to the appropriate mode of operation.|$|E
50|$|The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) {{provided}} the core ROM code for the PC.

The development team advertised this release as giving improved <b>boot-up</b> times, [...] "benefiting from the Ubuntu core developer team's improvements to boot-time code, the Xubuntu 9.04 desktop boots more quickly than ever. This means you can spend less time waiting, and more time being productive with your Xubuntu desktop." ...|$|E
50|$|The Palm Foleo was {{a planned}} {{subnotebook}} computer that was announced by mobile device manufacturer Palm Inc. on May 30, 2007, and canceled three months later. It intended {{to serve as}} a companion for smartphones including Palm's own Treo line. The device ran on the Linux operating system and featured 256 MB of flash memory and an immediate <b>boot-up</b> feature.|$|E

50|$|An {{instruction}} cycle (sometimes called a fetch-decode-execute cycle) {{is the basic}} operational process of a computer. It is {{the process by which}} a computer retrieves a program instruction from its memory, determines what actions the instruction dictates, and carries out those actions. This cycle is repeated continuously by a computer's central processing unit (CPU), from <b>boot-up</b> to when the computer is shut down.|$|E
5000|$|... "Kreegah Bundola" [...] {{is one of}} a few {{names for}} the Frank Zappa song whose most popular title seems to be [...] "Lets Move to Cleveland". It is also {{utilized}} in Bruce Covilles [...] "Allbright" [...] series as Grakkers [...] "violence" [...] module <b>boot-up</b> sound byte. It was uttered by a hunger-crazed Fat Freddy in an episode of The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.|$|E
50|$|The BeIA system {{presents}} a browser-based interface to the user. The browser {{was based on}} the Opera 4.0 code base, and was named Wagner. Unlike the BeOS, which runs the Tracker and Deskbar at <b>boot-up,</b> the BeIA OS boots straight into the Opera browser interface (much like the later Google Chrome OS). While it is possible to boot BeIA into an interface similar to the standard BeOS, doing so involves special knowledge.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, On Windows XP {{computers}} that use GeForce video cards with Scalable Link Interface (SLI) mode enabled, using a TV to display {{part of the}} desktop via VIVO is disabled, just as dual-monitor mode is disabled. Confusingly, however, some distorted images may be visible on a properly-connected VIVO-driven television display at <b>boot-up</b> {{due to the fact}} that prior to the OS loading the display driver, the video bios might initialize outputs that are then unavailable once the OS takes over and the driver loads into SLI mode.|$|E
50|$|In late 1995 {{to early}} 1996 Microsoft forced <b>boot-up</b> shells off OEM {{computers}} by updating its Microsoft Windows distribution agreement (OPK 2) and Packard Bell, {{without a clear}} on-shelf differentiator, saw sales begin to tumble. Also in 1995, Compaq sued Packard Bell for not disclosing that Packard Bell computers incorporated used parts. This practice was, in fact, widespread in the computer industry, including Compaq itself. However, unlike its rival companies, Packard Bell was judged not to have advertised the practice sufficiently in its warranties (Compaq, for instance, disclosed it in the warranty statement).|$|E
50|$|There {{are even}} more secret fighters {{available}} in the game. This game makes use of a time-release feature that makes more fighters available for play depending how long the arcade machine had been running since initial <b>boot-up.</b> Several newer single-PCB versions of the game eliminate the time-release feature outright and make all the fighters available for selection immediately. Secret ships include the Miclus (a collectible score item) and the second-player colored variation of the Raiden mk-II and Judge Spear, each with different weaponry and attributes than their counterparts.|$|E
50|$|The {{main problem}} with NFU {{is that it}} keeps track of the {{frequency}} of use {{without regard to the}} time span of use. Thus, in a multi-pass compiler, pages which were heavily used during the first pass, but are not needed in the second pass will be favoured over pages which are comparably lightly used in the second pass, as they have higher frequency counters. This results in poor performance. Other common scenarios exist where NFU will perform similarly, such as an OS <b>boot-up.</b> Thankfully, a similar and better algorithm exists, and its description follows.|$|E
50|$|Bethesda {{announced}} {{the game at}} their E3 2017 press conference with a trailer. The game was originally teased at their E3 2016 press conference in a <b>boot-up</b> sequence. Development began in 2014, soon {{after the release of}} The New Order. Continuing on from the trend of the previous game, the developers want to give more character to B.J. and to not only have the players play as him but also feel like they are him. New mechanics include the ability to freely mix weapons for dual wielding, commanders being able to call in multiple reinforcements and a hatchet for more gruesome takedowns.|$|E
50|$|The {{successor}} to the TX series was the TZ series in May 2007. This new design featured an optional 32 or 64GB Solid State Drive (SSD) for rapid <b>boot-up</b> times, quicker application launches and greater durability. If selected, a 250 GB Hard Drive could also {{have been included in}} place of the built-in CD/DVD drive to provide room for additional storage. For security, this model included a biometric fingerprint sensor and Trusted Platform Module. The TZ offered a built-in highly miniaturized Motion Eye camera built into the LCD panel for video conferencing. Additional features included the XBRITE LCD, integrated Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN) technology and Bluetooth technology.|$|E
5000|$|Task Force 1942 was {{mentioned}} in 1993 in Dragon #193 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in [...] "The Role of Computers" [...] column. The reviewers normally gave a game from 1 to 5 stars, but instead gave this game an [...] "X" [...] for [...] "Not recommended". This {{was due to}} the installation of the game not functioning properly on the reviewer's own PC, and thus not enabling them to actually <b>boot-up</b> and play the game. A 1993 Computer Gaming World surve of wargames gave the game three-plus stars out of five, approving of the graphics and depth of gameplay but criticizing the user interface and tactical-level AI.|$|E
5000|$|Aside {{from low}} price and brand confusion, Packard Bell's success {{in number of}} units sold {{may have come from}} two areas of innovation: 1) {{branding}} and industrial design, provided by the San Francisco offices of frog design; and 2) its <b>boot-up</b> shell Packard Bell Navigator, created by The Pixel Company in Seattle. They targeted a huge section of consumers who were inexperienced using computers. Frog design gave the look of quality and utilized innovations such as color-coding cable connectors (first seen on the IBM PS/2), while Navigator provided the ability for users to launch installed programs by clicking on-screen buttons, and then later a house metaphor. During this phase, returns dropped from 19% to 10%, and sales grew exponentially.|$|E
