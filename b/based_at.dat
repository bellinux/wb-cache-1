40|$|In this paper, {{we define}} the spaces {{with a regular}} <b>base</b> <b>at</b> non-isolated points and discuss some metrization theorems. We firstly show that a space X is a metrizable space, {{if and only if}} X is a regular space with a σ-locally finite <b>base</b> <b>at</b> non-isolated points, if and only if X is a perfect space with a regular <b>base</b> <b>at</b> non-isolated points, if and only if X is a β-space with a regular <b>base</b> <b>at</b> non-isolated points. In addition, we also discuss the {{relations}} between the spaces with a regular <b>base</b> <b>at</b> non-isolated points and some generalized metrizable spaces. Finally, we give an affirmative answer for a question posed by F. C. Lin and S. Lin in LL, which also shows that a space with a regular <b>base</b> <b>at</b> non-isolated points has a point-countable base. Comment: 12 page...|$|R

The VDF continued with XH558 until 1992, finishing operations after the Ministry of Defence determined it was too costly to run in light of budget cuts. Both aircraft subsequently entered preservation and survived, although a third, XH560, kept in reserve in the first years, was later scrapped.|$|E
