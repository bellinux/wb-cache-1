40|$|This study {{looks at}} the impact of {{non-traditional}} crops on farmers income focusing on the cultivation of birds-eye chili in two rural communities in Ghana. The two communities selected for this study both display the emerging characteristics of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa who are gradually shifting from attempting to raise yields of current crops to the cultivation of new, high value export crops in order to accrue higher incomes. A qualitative research method was employed to understand {{the factors that influence}} farmers to shift to the cultivation of birds-eye chili, the problems that are encountered in this new activity and most importantly the effect this has on their incomes. Elements of the popular sustainable livelihoods framework were adopted for analysing the impacts. The study revealed a number of issues relevant to the discourse on improving incomes of smallholders. The study confirmed the shift of some smallholders to cultivation of new, high value export crops such as birds-eye chili. Again the study provided evidence of a unique brand of farming known as <b>block</b> <b>farming</b> in one of the two communities and how this is contributing to higher incomes compared to traditional methods of farming. Challenges that are faced by birds-eye chili farmers were also identified and the extents to which these challenges impact incomes accrued from the activity were explored as well. The findings of the study point to the fact that birds-eye chili cultivation delivers higher and more stable incomes to the farmers especially for farmers on the block farms. Relying on evidence from the study, a number of recommendations were made regarding opportunities for future studies as well as for shaping future policies...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluated the}} link between Philippine Sugar cane farmers' goals, values and attitudes (and some selected efficiency-related variables) with production efficiency. The analysis was based on both information from informal interviews and formal primary data collection. The Data Envelopment Analysis technique {{was used to determine}} the relative efficiencies of individual farmers and to identify the major factors that influence the efficiency of production. Pure technical, scale, overall technical, allocative and economic efficiency measures were derived for the sample of sugar cane farmers from the Central Negros area, The Philippines. Under the specification of variable returns to scale (VRS), the mean pure technical, scale, overall technical, allocative and economic efficiency indices were 0. 7580, 0. 9884, 0. 7298, 0. 7941 and 0. 6025, respectively. The farmers' characteristics and their associations with goals and attitudes were determined. The result shows that 'per cent of land owned' is correlated with farmers' decision-making and thus their production efficiency. The study was unique in that it incorporated the farmers' values and attitudes towards farming and production efficiency. The Bootstrap regression method was used to determine the factors affecting the variations in farmers' efficiency. Factors positively associated with production efficiency include farm experience, exposure to extension and off-farm work; for goals and attitudes - the intrinsic independence goal, the instrumental aspects of farming, leisure orientation, optimistic attitude, and risk consciousness were all associated with efficiency. The key policy options that must be considered for addressing inefficiencies include education and extension advice, developing the importance of the instrumental aspects of farming, developing group (<b>block)</b> <b>farming</b> as well as farmers' and millers' cooperatives, improved access to credit and improved technology (with emphasis on soil and fertiliser management and the use of improved varieties) ...|$|E

40|$|There is circumstantial {{evidence}} that smallholder sugarcane farming systems have substantial {{effect on the}} profitability of smallholder farmers. Primary data collected through semi structured questionnaires administered to {{a random sample of}} smallholder sugarcane farmers in Morogoro region were analysed by T-Tests, One way ANOVA, Tobit regression and Spearman‟s rank correlation tests all at p = 0. 05 to comparatively assess differences and effects of hypothesized factors on profitability between <b>Block</b> <b>Farming</b> System (BFS) and Traditional Farming System (TFS). The effect of profitability of the farming systems on loan repayment rate (LRR) has also been analysed. BFS appears to be significantly more effective than TFS on both profitability and loan repayments. Profitability, expressed as a ratio of operating income to revenue, is significantly higher by 17 % in BFS (M = 0. 56) than profitability achieved through TFS (M = 0. 39). Yield, price and cost have significant effects on profitability of both BFS and TFS. Effects of land size and sucrose were found not to be significant on BFS but significant on TFS. Correlation between profitability and LRR is significantly high on both BFS, r (7) = 0. 84, p = 0. 04, and TFS, r (68) = 0. 79, p < 0. 0001. LRR through BFS (M = 0. 96) is significantly higher by 20 % than LRR through TFS (M = 0. 76). Reviews of the Agriculture and Livestock Policy and the Microfinance Policy are recommended. Generic model, FSP-M has been developed and recommended for future studies of profitability. Studies on how sucrose content is measured and its relation to sugarcane price setting is suggested. Also studies on factors affecting loan repayments among smallholder farmers as well as on institutional effects of microfinance institutions on loan repayment are recommended...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLand tenure {{security}} {{is widely considered}} to be a fundamental factor in motivating farmers to adopt sustainable land management practices. This study aims to establish whether it is true that owner-operators adopt more effective soil conservation measures than tenant-operators, and whether well-designed agro-environmental instruments can provide sufficiently strong motivation to compensate for the differences between these two groups. An analysis of the level of adoption of four types of erosion control measures on 263 blocks of arable land endangered by water erosion in the Czech Republic has proved that all measures were adopted by owners significantly more frequently than by tenants. Compared to tenants, owners applied wide-row crops in crop rotation schemes 2. 4 times less frequently in the last 5 years, while they applied soil-improving crops 1. 9 times more frequently. Contour farming was adopted 1. 8 times more often by owners, and the slope length in production <b>blocks</b> <b>farmed</b> by owners was on an average 2. 4 times shorter than in <b>blocks</b> <b>farmed</b> by tenants. However, the study has also shown that, in cases where conservation measures are supported by incentives based on Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC) standards cross compliance, the differences in the approach to soil conservation between owners and tenants were minimized or eliminated, due to the adoption of responsible practices by tenants. The study has proved that a well-designed system of environmentally determined subsidies can compensate otherwise substantial differences in the attitude of owners and tenants towards soil conservation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to compare two methods of farming, {{especially}} their effect on water soil erosion. The examined methods were (1) large-scale farming, where more than 50 % of the land was leased, and (2) small-scale farming, where the land was almost exclusively privately owned. The research area was 8 cadastres in the district of Hodonín, South Moravia, Czech Republic. In these cadastres 48 land blocks representing both large-scale and small-scale farming (i. e. owners and tenants) were chosen. The long-term average annual soil loss caused by water erosion (G) was calculated using the erosion model USLE 2 D and ArcGIS 10. 1. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used for the statistical evaluation of the data. The difference between the soil loss (G) on land <b>blocks</b> <b>farmed</b> by small producers (owners) and large producers (tenants) was significant (p < 0. 05). Differences between the values of the cropping-management factor (C) were not statistically significant (p = 0. 054). Based on the analysis of other variables in the USLE equation it can be stated that a continuous slope length, conditioned by the size of land blocks, {{played an important role in}} the amount of soil loss caused by water erosion. Above all, to protect the soil from erosion and maintain soil quality it is necessary to reduce the size of land <b>blocks</b> <b>farmed</b> by tenants and improve the crop rotation systems...|$|R
