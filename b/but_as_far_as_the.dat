500|$|In November 2008, Larkin {{announced}} that the band would be reforming and recording a new album. The following summer, the band toured as support to Mötley Crüe's Crüe Fest 2 tour and released a non-album single, [...] "Whiskey Hangover". After the tour, Godsmack started production for their new album. The album, titled The Oracle was released on , 2010. Arriving to popular reception, The Oracle is Godsmack's third straight full-length studio album to debut at No.1 with 117,000 sold {{in the first week}} of release. Erna had this to say about the early sound album, [...] "It's gonna be really heavy. I mean, it's very aggressive. I'm not really sure; it's very premature right now. Right now we just finished one track for the Crüe Fest this Summer. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> whole record goes, I think it's going to be a lot more in your face. I don't think there's going to be any 'Voodoo's or 'Serenity's on this one. We decided to go balls out!".|$|E
500|$|Dyke {{believed}} it was significant that [...] "six of the largest clubs" [...] voted against BSkyB. He wrote a formal letter to Quinton which asked for the bidding process to be reopened as the network was barred from bettering BSkyB's bid. Quinton however rejected the plea and clarified the league's stance: BSkyB's bid was better [...] "...not only in money terms <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> potential for future income is concerned." [...] The ITV companies sought legal action, claiming a breach of obligation on behalf of Quinton and Parry. East revealed {{that it was only}} after BSkyB had won did they discover the company had submitted an improved bid: [...] "At no stage were we informed that Sky had put in another bid and nor were we given any opportunity to increase our bid in response." [...] Parry said ITV would have won broadcasting rights had they [...] "allowed us to have a pay channel in the long term and it had terrestrial coverage in the short-term." [...] The High Court refused to grant an injunction; the judge concluded the matter was [...] "a great deal more difficult than it seems at first sight" [...] and {{it would be wrong to}} force the league to consider new offers. The court however found an arguable case for a breach of confidence. Soon afterwards, ITV issued a writ seeking damages against the FA and Premier League. They also submitted a separate complaint to the Office of Fair Trading to look into Murdoch's newspapers.|$|E

2500|$|Drummer Pete Finestone left Bad Religion {{again in}} April 1991 {{to focus on}} his other band, the Fishermen, which had signed with a major label, and Bobby Schayer joined the band as his replacement. In May 1991, Bad Religion entered the Westbeach Recorders studio to begin {{recording}} material for their sixth studio album, Generator, which was not released until March 1992. The album was recorded almost live in the studio, because, at the time, Gurewitz had moved Westbeach to larger premises, {{and for the first}} time, the entire band could play in the studio at the same time. He stated that it was [...] "time to change" [...] and the band [...] "did it in a different studio, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> songwriting, it was a deliberate effort to try something different". To accompany the album, Bad Religion filmed their first music video [...] "Atomic Garden", which was also their first song to be released as a single.|$|E
2500|$|Conscience, as the {{subjective}} {{expression of the}} presupposed identity of reason and nature in their bases, guarantees the practicability of our moral vocation. Nature is preordained or constituted to become the symbol and organ of mind, just as mind is endowed with the impulse to realize this end. But the moral law must not be conceived under {{the form of an}} [...] "imperative" [...] or a [...] "Sollen"; it differs from a law of nature only as being descriptive {{of the fact that it}} ranks the mind as conscious will, or Zweckdenken, above nature. Strictly speaking, the antitheses of good and bad and of free and necessary have no place in an ethical system, but simply in history, which is obliged to compare the actual with the ideal, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> terms [...] "good" [...] and [...] "bad" [...] are used in morals they express the rule or the contrary of reason, or the harmony or the contrary of the particular and the general. The idea of free as opposed to necessary expresses simply the fact that the mind can propose to itself ends, though a man cannot alter his own nature.|$|E

60|$|It {{was some}} time before this happened, for he had got a very fine hand indeed.

60|$|At {{last the}} long night broke, and a {{tropical}} sun smote {{down upon the}} rolling water. Jane Porter had dropped into a fitful slumber--the fierce light of the sun upon her upturned face awoke her. She looked about her. In the boat with her were three sailors, Clayton, and Monsieur Thuran. Then she looked for the other boats, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> eye could reach {{there was nothing to}} break the fearful monotony of that waste of waters--they were alone in a small boat upon the broad Atlantic.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] resumed Father Brown, [...] "it's {{not fair}} to say that the public {{impression}} is just what I've said, without adding that two things have happened since. I can't say they threw a new light; for nobody can make sense of them. But they threw a new kind of darkness; they threw the darkness in new directions. The first was this. The family physician of the St. Clares quarrelled with that family, and began publishing a violent series of articles, in which he said that the late general was a religious maniac; <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> tale went, this seemed to mean little more than a religious man.|$|E
6000|$|Among {{other models}} of statues {{heretofore}} made, Powers showed us one of Melancholy, or rather of Contemplation, from Milton's [...] "Penseroso"; a female figure with uplifted face and rapt look, [...] "communing with the skies." [...] It is very fine, and goes deeply into Milton's thought; <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> outward form and action are concerned, I remember seeing a rude engraving {{in my childhood}} that probably suggested the idea. It was prefixed to a cheap American edition of Milton's poems, and was probably as familiar to Powers as to myself. It is very remarkable how difficult {{it seems to be}} to strike out a new attitude in sculpture; a new group, or a new single figure.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am quite}} ready to go. After all, an English racecourse makes but a dull show {{by the side of}} an Indian one. The horses are better, and, of course, there is no {{comparison}} between the turnouts and the dresses of the women, though they manage to make a brave show at the principal stations; <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> general appearance of the crowd goes, you are not in it here. The natives in their gay dresses and turbans give a wonderfully light and gay appearance to the course, and though, possibly, among quite the lower class they may not all be estimable characters, at least they do not look such a pack of unmitigated ruffians as the hangers-on of an English racecourse. That was a nice specimen who attacked Hawtrey.' ...|$|E

60|$|Another {{interesting}} subdivision {{consists of}} certain plants, discovered by H. Muller, some individuals of which bear conspicuous flowers adapted for cross- fertilisation by {{the aid of}} insects, and others much smaller and less conspicuous flowers, which have often been slightly modified so as to ensure self-fertilisation. Lysimachia vulgaris, Euphrasia officinalis, Rhinanthus crista-galli, and Viola tricolor come under this head. (Introduction/4. H. Muller 'Nature' September 25, 1873 volume 8 page 433 and November 20, 1873 volume 9 page 44. Also 'Die Befruchtung der Blumen' etc. 1873 page 294.) The smaller and less conspicuous flowers are not closed, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> purpose which they serve is concerned, namely, the assured propagation of the species, they approach in nature cleistogamic flowers; but they differ from them by the two kinds being produced on distinct plants.|$|E
60|$|It went on till at {{last the}} wise men decided that the girl only wanted to be {{relieved}} by her old lover, that she might take a new lover with his permission. The girl was no doubt peculiar; <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> wise ones could learn from her manner,--for with words she would say nothing,--that was her state of mind. So the interview was planned,--to the infinite disgust of the Countess, who, however, believed that it might avail; {{and we know what}} was the result. Lady Anna, who long had doubted,--who had at last almost begun to doubt whether Daniel Thwaite was true to her,--had renewed her pledges, strengthened her former promises, and was now more firmly betrothed than ever to him whom the Countess hated as a very fiend upon earth. But there certainly should be no marriage! Though she pistolled the man at the altar, there should be no marriage.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{matter is}} {{difficult}} and not without danger," [...] the hermit said. [...] "As {{to the nature of}} the country, I myself know but little, for my dealings with the natives have been few and simple. There are, however, several Christian communities dwelling among the heathen. They are poor, and are forced to live in little-frequented localities. Their Christianity may be suspected by their neighbors, but as they do no man harm, and carry on their worship in secret, they are little interfered with. There is one community among the hills between this and Jerusalem, and I can give you instructions for reaching this, together with a token which will secure you hospitality there, and they will no doubt do their best to forward you to another station. When you approach the flat country where the armies are maneuvering you must doubtless trust to yourself; <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> slopes extend, methinks that our friends will be able to pass you without great difficulty." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 486. M. Biot is very {{cautious}} in expressing an opinion {{as to the}} cause of the separation of the elements of a compound body[A]. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> effects can be understood, he refers them to the opposite electrical states of the portions of the decomposing substance in the neighbourhood of the two poles. The fluid is most positive at the positive pole; that state gradually diminishes to the middle distance, where the fluid is neutral or not electrical; but from thence to the negative pole it becomes more and more negative[B]. When a particle of salt is decomposed at the negative pole, the acid particle is considered as acquiring a negative electrical state from the pole, stronger than that of the surrounding undecomposed particles, and is therefore repelled from amongst them, and from out of that portion of the liquid towards the positive pole, towards which also it is drawn by the attraction of the pole itself and the particles of positive undecomposed fluid around it[C].|$|E
60|$|Now I {{suppose that}} through the whole of this process {{he has been able}} to refer to his {{definite}} memory or conception of nature for every one of the fragments he has successively added, that the details, color, fractures, insertions, etc., of his boughs, are all either actual recollections or based on secure knowledge of the tree, (and herein I allow far more than is commonly the case with unimaginative painters.) <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> process of combination is concerned, it is evident that from beginning to end his laws have been his safety, and his plague has been his liberty. He has been compelled to work at random, or under the guidance of feeling only, whenever there was anything left to his own decision. He has never been decided in anything except in what he must or must not do. He has walked as a drunken man on a broad road, his guides are the hedges; and between these limits, the broader the way, the worse he gets on.|$|E
60|$|As {{there were}} only two horses to be inspected, and as Fred Neville {{absolutely}} refused the groom's invitation to look at the old carriage horses belonging to the family, he was back in his aunt's room before Miss Mellerby had gone upstairs to dress for dinner. The introduction was made, and Fred did his best to make himself agreeable. He was such a man that no girl could, at the first sight of him, think herself injured by being asked to love him. She was a good girl, and would have consented to marry no man without feeling sure of his affections; but Fred Neville was bold and frank as well as handsome, and had plenty to say for himself. It might be that he was vicious, or ill-tempered, or selfish, and it would be necessary that she should know much of him before she would give herself into his keeping; <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> first sight went, and the first hearing, Sophie Mellerby's impressions were all in Fred's favour.
