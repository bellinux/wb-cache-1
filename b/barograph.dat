In the system's aftermath a, 60-person relief team was deployed from Tahiti to the affected islands to assist with emergency operations. The French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin both sent messages of support to the Leeward Islands, and in French Polynesia, the system was considered {{to be one of the}} worst natural disasters in the islands' history. A few days after Cyclone Alan impacted the islands, Cyclone Bart caused an additional ten deaths and some minor damage to the French territory. During December 1998, the European Community Humanitarian Office responded to a government appeal, providing for tents, medical aid, food and clothing.|$|E

25|$|Investigators {{headed by}} Prokofiev arrived on site on horseback 24 {{hours after the}} crash and issued their first {{statement}} on February 1. They acknowledged that the crew died of high speed impact at 16:21 Moscow time; the flight logs, found intact, revealed that the crewmembers were unaware of imminent catastrophe until 16:10, when the balloon descended to 12,000 meters. This moment was marked {{as the beginning of}} an irrecoverable dive. Airspeed beyond design limits snapped the suspension cables and tore open the envelope; eventually the gondola completely separated from the falling balloon. There was no evidence of icing despite early reports in Pravda.

2500|$|On the {{day when}} Shenandoah crashed, Settle was {{training}} alone in a captive kite balloon. After the crash he volunteered for airship pilot training and received his Naval Aviator's [...] (Airship) wings No. 3350 on January 19, 1927.

2500|$|Question Mark {{took off}} from Van Nuys at 7:26a.m. on New Years Day 1929 with Eaker at the controls, {{carrying}} only [...] of fuel to save takeoff weight. Aboard the Question Mark, either Halverson or Quesada {{did most of the}} piloting during cruising flight while Eaker monitored the throttles for smoothest engine performance. A log was kept by the flight officer (co-pilot) and dropped to the ground daily, and Eaker was responsible for winding the <b>barograph,</b> an instrument that continuously recorded altitude and time as documentary evidence for the records.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the next}} flight the Marine Corps {{recommended}} their representative, Major Chester L. Fordney, to join Settle as instrument operator (the experiments were vital to justify financing of the flight). Fordney himself [...] "was crazy for tying up with an adventurer like Settle". On November 20 they lifted off from the Goodyear-Zeppelin facilities in Akron, Ohio, watched by {{only a few hundred}} spectators. Nevertheless, the flight received national publicity as radio transmissions from the stratosphere were broadcast on radio networks. Century floated at peak altitude for two hours, and landed softly in Bridgeton, New Jersey marshes in the confluence of Delaware and Cohansey rivers, incidentally, a few miles from Jean Piccard's home. It was already dark, so Settle and Fordney spent the night in the chilling cold of the gondola. They dumped radio batteries during descent, so in the morning Fordney waded five miles through the swamp in search for help. The balloon's <b>barograph,</b> examined by the National Bureau of Standards, confirmed the world altitude record of 18,665 meters (61,237 feet). The flight earned Settle the Harmon Trophy and the FAI Henri de la Vaulx medal. Earlier in 1933 the USSR-1 had flown to 62,230 feet, but it was not recognized by the FAI, so Settle and Fordney became the official record holder until the flight of Explorer II in 1935.|$|E

2500|$|He {{entered the}} 1910 Gordon Bennett International Balloon Race with Augustus Post {{and they left}} {{the grounds of the}} Aero Club of St. Louis at 5:45p.m. on Monday, October 17, 1910, in their balloon America II. The balloon had been {{specially}} constructed in France for this race and was owned by Major James C. McCoy. During the flight they took watches of three hours each, [...] "one sleeping and one watching the statiscopes, aneroid, and other instruments" [...] (sic). A recording <b>barograph</b> (altimeter) kept a precise log of their altitude during the flight. They reached altitudes of 5,000 meters (16400ft) above the altitude of St. Louis, their 0 altitude reference point. St. Louis is at 140 meters (465ft) above sea level. 46 hours later, at 3:45p.m. on Wednesday, 19 October they landed {{in the middle of the}} wilderness in Quebec, Canada, about [...] north of Chicoutimi. They had been forced to land because of a storm. They were on a hillside at some [...] altitude and had traveled 1887.6 kilometers (1,173mi) from St. Louis. They had traveled at an average of 50 kilometres per hour (30 miles per hour). The next day they traveled south towards the last inhabited area they had passed over. Hawley was slowed by an ankle twisted just after landing. For the next three days they walked, sleeping under their blankets at night and eating a bare minimum of food. They eventually came upon a trapper's hut, at the edge of Lake St. John, which was not occupied at that moment. They rested there for a day, after which two French Canadian men out on a hunting trip arrived and agreed to help them. The trappers took them to Saint-Ambroise-de-Kildare, Quebec. Once there, they sent telegrams to family and the Aero Club to let them know they were alright. The message Hawley sent to his brother read: [...] "Landed in wilderness week ago, fifty miles north of Chicoutimi. Both well —Alan." [...] Their telegrams ended searches which had various parties had started, looking for them around the Great Lakes. Clifford B. Harman, a wealthy amateur aeronaut and aviator, had offered $1,000 to anyone who found Hawley and Post, dead or alive. On the evening before their telegrams were sent, Harmon had increased the reward to $7,000.|$|E

This is followed by a discussion of performance requirements for such instruments and an account of the methods of testing developed by the Bureau of Standards. The report concludes with a brief account of the results of recent investigations. For accurate measurements of altitude, reference must also be made to thermometer readings of atmospheric temperature, since the altitude is not fixed by atmospheric pressure alone. This matter is discussed in connection with barometric altitude determination...|$|R
5000|$|In gauges {{intended}} to sense small pressures or pressure differences, or require that an absolute pressure be measured, the gear train and needle may {{be driven by}} an enclosed and sealed bellows chamber, called an aneroid, which means [...] "without liquid". (Early barometers used a column of liquid such as water or the liquid metal mercury suspended by a vacuum.) This bellows configuration is used in aneroid barometers (barometers with an indicating needle and dial card), altimeters, altitude recording <b>barographs,</b> and the altitude telemetry instruments used in weather balloon radiosondes. These devices use the sealed chamber as a reference pressure and are driven by the external pressure. Other sensitive aircraft instruments such as air speed indicators and rate of climb indicators (variometers) have connections both to the internal part of the aneroid chamber and to an external enclosing chamber.|$|R
50|$|On November 4, Gray {{attempted}} {{to set an}} official record. After reaching an altitude of 40,000 feet, he lost consciousness and died. His {{body was found in}} the balloon basket in a tree near Sparta, Tennessee, the next day. The balloon's <b>barographs</b> showed that Gray had reached a height between 43,000 and 44,000 feet. There were various theories about the cause of Gray's death. He may have severed his oxygen hose accidentally while cutting open bags of sand ballast. It is also possible that Gray became too cold and tired to open the valve on one of his oxygen tanks, or that an internal organ was ruptured by decreasing pressure. Aeronaut Albert Leo Stevens believed that Gray died during descent or on impact. The Scott Field board of inquiry which investigated Gray's death concluded that he died because his clock stopped, causing him to lose track of his time on oxygen and exhaust his supply.|$|R

2500|$|An aneroid {{barometer}} is {{an instrument for}} measuring pressure as a method that does not involve liquid. Invented in 1844 by French scientist Lucien Vidi, the {{aneroid barometer}} uses a small, flexible metal box called an aneroid cell (capsule), which is made from an alloy of beryllium and copper. The evacuated capsule (or usually several capsules, stacked to add up their movements) is prevented from collapsing by a strong spring. Small changes in external air pressure cause the cell to expand or contract. [...] This expansion and contraction drives mechanical levers such that the tiny movements of the capsule are amplified and displayed {{on the face of}} the aneroid barometer. [...] Many models include a manually set needle which is used to mark the current measurement so a change can be seen. [...] In addition, the mechanism is made deliberately [...] "stiff" [...] so that tapping the barometer reveals whether the pressure is rising or falling as the pointer moves. This type of barometer is common in homes and in recreational boats, as well as small aircraft. It is also used in meteorology, mostly in <b>barographs</b> and as a pressure instrument in radiosondes.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of sound refraction {{in the water column}} on the accuracy of depths calculated from oblique swath angles of Multibeam Echosounders. This was accomplished by analysing data collected from the Tamar Estuary, Plymouth Sound and the Northeast Atlantic Ocean.

Resulting values were graphed as sound velocity profiles and <b>barographs</b> thus visually illustrating discrepancies in sound speed estimation between the three sound speed formulae, leading {{to the conclusion that the}} sound speed formula used for the calculation of sound speed in the water column is a source of error related to the horizontal position in a charted depth. The last phase of analysis utilised ray tracing to compare the horizontal distance a sound ray refracted in the water column from sound pulses emitted at near vertical and oblique angles. In all analysis, the extent of refraction increased as the swath angle increased as did the error between the estimated sound speeds from the Chen & Millero, MacKenzie and Medwin formulae. This study establishes the sound velocity formula used to compute sound speed in the water column and refraction at large oblique angles of Multibearn sonars contribute to errors associated with outer swaths of Multibeam sonars, thus contributing error to the horizontal position of chart depths...|$|R
