5|$|An {{example of}} this type of {{decomposition}} into interdigitating trees can be seen in some simple types of mazes, with a single entrance and no disconnected components of its walls. In this case both the maze walls and the space between the walls {{take the form of a}} mathematical tree. If the free space of the maze is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this system of cells can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> embedding of a planar graph, in which the tree structure of the walls forms a spanning tree of the graph and the tree structure of the free space forms a spanning tree of the dual graph. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|E
5|$|In all, the Renaissance could <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{attempt by}} intellectuals {{to study and}} improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel {{approaches}} to thought. Some scholars, such as Rodney Stark, play down the Renaissance {{in favor of the}} earlier innovations of the Italian city-states in the High Middle Ages, which married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of capitalism. This analysis argues that, whereas the great European states (France and Spain) were absolutist monarchies, and others were under direct Church control, the independent city republics of Italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates and set off a vast unprecedented commercial revolution that preceded and financed the Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|Renwick {{resisted}} the BBC's attempt to broadcast the episode at Christmas, feeling that such scheduling would contrast unfavourably with the grimness of the show, and would <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> overt attempt to garner high ratings. The controller of BBC1 relented and the episode was first transmitted on BBC One on 20 November 2000. The broadcast {{coincided with the}} transmission of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?s first UK jackpot win. Some people within the BBC alleged that Celador, the production company in charge of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had rigged Judith Keppel's victory to spoil the BBC's expected high ratings for the sitcom's finale. The Independent Television Commission (ITC) cleared Celador and ITV of any wrongdoing.|$|E

5|$|The prosecution's {{case against}} Hess was {{presented}} by Mervyn Griffith-Jones beginning on 7 February 1946. By quoting from Hess's speeches, {{he attempted to}} demonstrate that Hess had been aware of and agreed with Hitler's plans to conduct a war of aggression in violation of international law. He declared that as Hess had signed important governmental decrees, including the decree requiring mandatory military service, the Nuremberg racial laws, and a decree incorporating the conquered Polish territories into the Reich, he must share responsibility for the acts of the regime. He {{pointed out that the}} timing of Hess's trip to Scotland, only six weeks before the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, could only <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attempt by Hess to keep the British out of the war. Hess resumed showing symptoms of amnesia at the end of February, partway through the prosecution's case.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of its {{military}} outcome, the Siege of Dubrovnik is primarily remembered for the large-scale looting by JNA troops and the artillery bombardment of Dubrovnik, especially its Old Town. The reaction of the international media and {{media coverage of the}} siege reinforced an opinion, already taking shape since the fall of Vukovar, that the conduct of the JNA and the Serbs was barbaric and intent on dominating Croatiaregardless of the destruction of priceless cultural heritage that occurred in the process. Serbian authorities thought the international community had no moral grounds to judge because they did not interfere when hundreds of thousands of Serbs were killed in Croatian concentration camps during World War II. Besides the protests made by Mayor Zaragoza, Vance and the ECMM, 104 Nobel Prize laureates published a full-page advertisement in The New York Times on 14 January 1992 at the incentive of Linus Pauling, urging governments throughout the world to stop the unrestrained destruction by the JNA. Because the siege shaped the international opinion of the Croatian War of Independence, it became a major contributor to a shift in the international diplomatic and economic isolation of Serbia and rump Yugoslavia, which came to <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> aggressor-state in the West. On 17 December 1991, the European Economic Community agreed to recognize the independence of Croatia on 15 January 1992.|$|E
