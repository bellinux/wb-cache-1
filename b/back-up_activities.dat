40|$|The mild {{phenotype}} {{associated with}} targeted dis-ruption {{of the mouse}} OGG 1 and NTH 1 genes {{has been attributed to}} the existence of <b>back-up</b> <b>activities</b> and/or alternative pathways for the removal of oxi-dised DNA bases. We have characterised two new genes in human cells that encode DNA glycosyl-ases, homologous to the bacterial Fpg (MutM) /Nei class of enzymes, capable of removing lesions that are substrates for both hOGG 1 and hNTH 1. One gene, designated HFPG 1, showed ubiquitous expression in all tissues examined whereas the second gene, HFPG 2, was only expressed at detect-able levels in the thymus and testis. Transient trans-fections of HeLa cells with fusions of the cDNAs to EGFP revealed intracellular sorting to the nucleus with accumulation in the nucleoli for hFPG 1, while hFPG 2 co-localised with the 30 kDa subunit of RPA. hFPG 1 was puri®ed and shown to act on DNA sub-strates containing 8 -oxoguanine, 5 -hydroxycytosine and abasic sites. Removal of 8 -oxoguanine, but not cleavage at abasic sites, was opposite base-dependent, with 8 -oxoG:C being the preferred sub-strate and negligible activity towards 8 -oxoG:A. It thus appears that hFPG 1 has properties similar to mammalian OGG 1 in preventing mutations arising from misincorporation of A across 8 -oxoG and could function as a back-up repair activity for OGG 1 in ogg 1 ±/ ± mice...|$|E
40|$|The abasic (AP) sites, {{the major}} {{mutagenic}} and cytotoxic genomic lesions, induced directly by oxidative stress and indirectly after excision of damaged bases by DNA glycosylases, are repaired by AP-endonucleases (APEs). Among two APEs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Apn 1 provides the major APE activity, and Apn 2, the ortholog of the mammalian APE, provides <b>back-up</b> <b>activity.</b> We have cloned apn 1 and apn 2 genes of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and {{have shown that}} inactivation of Apn 2 and not Apn 1 sensitizes this ®ssion yeast to alkylation and oxidative damageinducing agents, which is further enhanced by Apn 1 inactivation. We also show that Uve 1, present in S. pombe but not in S. cerevisiae, provides the backup APE activity together with Apn 1. We con®rmed the presence of APE activity in recombinant Apn 2 and in crude cell extracts. Thus S. pombe is distinct from S. cerevisiae, and is similar to mammalian cells in having Apn 2 as the major APE...|$|R

40|$|The {{manner in}} which {{teachers}} mediate children's learning varies across early childhood classrooms. In this study, we used a multielement design to evaluate the efficacy of three commonly implemented strategies that varied in teacher directedness for teaching color- and object-name relations. Strategy 1 consisted of brief exposure to the target relations followed by an exclusively child-led play period in which correct responses were praised. Strategy 2 was similar except that teachers prompted the children to vocalize relations and corrected errors via model prompts. Strategy 3 incorporated the same procedures as Strategy 2 except that {{a brief period of}} teacher-initiated trials was arranged; these trials involved the use of prompt delay between questions and prompts, and correct responses resulted in tokens and <b>back-up</b> <b>activity</b> reinforcers. Children's preferences for the different teaching strategies were also directly assessed. Strategy 3 was most effective in promoting the acquisition and generalization of the color- and object-name relations and was also most preferred by the majority of children, Strategy 1 was the least effective, and Strategy 2 was typically the least preferred. Implications for the design of early educational environments based on evidence-based values are discussed...|$|R
40|$|DNA N-glycosylase/AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) lyase enzymes of the {{endonuclease}} III family (nth in Esche-richia coli and Nth 1 in mammalian organisms) initiate DNA base {{excision repair}} of oxidized ring saturated pyrimidine residues. We generated a null mouse (mNth 1 /) by gene targeting. After almost 2 years, such mice exhibited no overt abnormalities. Tissues of mNth 1 / mice contained an enzymatic activity which cleaved DNA at sites of oxidized thymine residues (thymine glycol [Tg]). The activity was greater when Tg was paired with G than with A. This {{is in contrast}} to Nth 1, which is more active against Tg:A pairs than Tg:G pairs. We suggest that there is a <b>back-up</b> mammalian repair <b>activity</b> which attacks Tg:G pairs with much greater efficiency than Tg:A pairs. The significance of this activity may relate to repair of oxidized 5 -methyl cytosine residues (5 meCyt). It was shown previously (S. Zuo, R. J. Boorstein, and G. W. Teebor, Nucleic Acids Res. 23 : 3239 - 3243, 1995) that both ionizing radiation and chemical oxidation yielded Tg from 5 meCyt residues in DNA. Thus, this previously undescribed, and hence novel, <b>back-up</b> enzyme <b>activity</b> may function to repair oxidized 5 meCyt residues in DNA while also being sufficient to compensate for the loss of Nth 1 in the mutant mice, thereby explaining the noninformative phenotype. Escherichia coli endonuclease III and its eukaryotic ho-mologs initiate the process of DNA base excision repair (BER...|$|R

40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{mutations}} in APN 1, APN 2 and either RAD 1 or RAD 10 genes are synthetic lethal. In fact, apn 1 apn 2 rad 1 triple mutants can form microcolonies of ∼ 300 cells. Expression of Nfo, the bacterial homologue of Apn 1, suppresses the lethality. Turning off {{the expression of}} Nfo induces G 2 /M cell cycle arrest in an apn 1 apn 2 rad 1 triple mutant. The activation of this checkpoint is RAD 9 dependent and allows residual DNA repair. The Mus 81 /Mms 4 complex was identified as one of these <b>back-up</b> repair <b>activities.</b> Furthermore, inactivation of Ntg 1, Ntg 2 and Ogg 1 DNA N-glycosylase/AP lyases in the apn 1 apn 2 rad 1 background delayed lethality, allowing the formation of minicolonies of ∼ 105 cells. These results demonstrate that, under physiological conditions, endogenous DNA damage causes death in cells deficient in Apn 1, Apn 2 and Rad 1 /Rad 10 proteins. We propose a model in which endogenous DNA abasic sites are converted into 3 ′-blocked single-strand breaks (SSBs) by DNA N-glycosylases/AP lyases. Therefore, we suggest that the essential and overlapping function of Apn 1, Apn 2, Rad 1 /Rad 10 and Mus 81 /Mms 4 is to repair 3 ′-blocked SSBs using their 3 ′-phosphodiesterase activity or their 3 ′-flap endonuclease activity, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Holliday {{junctions}} (HJs) are cruciform DNA {{structures that}} are created during recombination events. It {{is a matter}} of considerable importance to determine the resolvase(s) that promote resolution of these structures. We previously reported that C. elegans GEN- 1 is a symmetrically cleaving HJ resolving enzyme required for recombinational repair, but we could not find an overt role in meiotic recombination. Here we identify C. elegans proteins involved in resolving meiotic HJs. We found no evidence for a redundant meiotic function of GEN- 1. In contrast, we discovered two redundant HJ resolution pathways likely coordinated by the SLX- 4 scaffold protein and also involving the HIM- 6 /BLM helicase. SLX- 4 associates with the SLX- 1, MUS- 81 and XPF- 1 nucleases and has been implicated in meiotic recombination in C. elegans. We found that C. elegans [mus- 81; xpf- 1], [slx- 1; xpf- 1], [mus- 81; him- 6] and [slx- 1; him- 6] double mutants showed a similar reduction in survival rates as slx- 4. Analysis of meiotic diakinesis chromosomes revealed a distinct phenotype in these double mutants. Instead of wild-type bivalent chromosomes, pairs of "univalents" linked by chromatin bridges occur. These linkages depend on the conserved meiosis-specific transesterase SPO- 11 and can be restored by ionizing radiation, suggesting that they represent unresolved meiotic HJs. This suggests the existence of two major resolvase activities, one provided by XPF- 1 and HIM- 6, the other by SLX- 1 and MUS- 81. In all double mutants crossover (CO) recombination is reduced but not abolished, indicative of further redundancy in meiotic HJ resolution. Real time imaging revealed extensive chromatin bridges during the first meiotic division that appear to be eventually resolved in meiosis II, suggesting <b>back-up</b> resolution <b>activities</b> acting at or after anaphase I. We also show that in HJ resolution mutants, the restructuring of chromosome arms distal and proximal to the CO still occurs, suggesting that CO initiation but not resolution is likely to be required for this process...|$|R
40|$|Lake Bornsjön is {{situated}} 30 km southwest of Stockholm in a rift valley lake and consist three basins outstretched in northwest-southeast direction. The surface area is 6, 7 km 2 {{with a maximum}} depth of 18, 3 meters, a mean depth of 9, 8 meters and a retention time of the water of 6, 5 years. The drainage area is 42 km 2 and consists mainly of arable land (ca 1000 ha) and productive forestry land (2500 ha), but in the drainage area there are also restored and fairly newly constructed wetlands. Today the Stockholm area receives its drinking water from Lake Mälaren, but {{if there would be}} any pollution of this source, Lake Bornsjön would act as the water source. The area surrounding the lake was bought already in 1899 by Stockholm Stad for protection of the lake and was taken over 1993 by Stockholm Vatten AB. It has been a water protection area from 1988 and it was also accepted as a nature reserve in 1995. This involve some restrictions like prohibition against fishing, bathing and to tread the ice on the lake in the winter and only <b>back-up</b> water <b>activities</b> are allowed on and in the lake. According to information from the 1970 s the phosphorus content increased in the surface and bottom waters and later in the mid 1980 s the phosphorus decreased (Lännergren 1996). 1986 Lake Bornsjön showed some indications of a deteriorated lake status which lead to an investigation the following year that showed an accumulation of phosphorus in the sediment of the deepest parts of the lake (Pettersson 1987). The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the present leakage of phosphorus from the sediment to the water column in Lake Bornsjön today and to compare the results with the investigation carried out in 1987. The study aims is also to investigate in which basin the leakage of phosphorus is most severe and to try to explain the variation between the basins. Three different methods were used to analyse the content of the phosphorus in the sediment; phosphorus fractionation, ICP-AES and XRF. In a fractionation the phosphorus is determined in six different forms such as NH 4 Cl-P (loosly sorbed P, porewater-P and in hardwater lakes also CaCO 3 - associated P), BD-P (P absorbed to iron and manganese and these forms are sensitive for low redox potential), NaOH-rP (P associated mainly with aluminium), NaOH-nrP (organic-P including bacteria-incorporated P), HCl-P (assumed endured apatite) and finally residual phosphorus witch you calculate by taking total phosphorus (TP) minus the extracted forms of phosphorus. The residual phosphorus consist refractory organic P and inert inorganic P. The ICP-AES - method (Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy), is used to investigate the amount of elements, in this study phosphorus, iron and aluminium. ICP-AES is a multi element technique and the method can be used to determine around 40 different elements. In the XRF - method (X-ray-fluorescence) the sample is irritated by X-ray beams which results in electron excitation and when the electron falls back in to their original shells it establish fluorescence radiation (Hulterström 2006). The radiation energy is registered by a half detector and dependence on from which shell that the electron falls from it create different kinds of energy and this makes it measurable. With a pulse counter the different energies and elements are separated. The XRF- technique is more sensitive in detecting heavier element. Field work was carried out from a boat using a gravity corer to collect lake sediment cores. In total 18 sediment cores was sampled which were taken at three different occasions in the fall 2006. The sediment sampling was carried out at the same time as the ordinary water samples were collected. The study also included a phosphorus leakage experiment in vitro where sediment cores with the water column above were incubated in 22 days. The results of the investigation show that there is highest share accumulated total phosphorus, deeper than 10 m, with an assumed sediment density of 1 000 000 g/m 3 (personal communication Rydin Emil) in the Skårby Basin (BS) 14, 90 g/m 2 but the highest amount of mobile phosphorus was found in the Bornsjö Basin (BB) 7, 08 g/m 2 based on data from sediment layer 0 - 17 cm. The average of total phosphorus in the sediment for the whole lake deeper than 10 m was at the current sampling occasion (2006 - 10 - 17) 12, 08 g/m 2 and mobile phosphorus, 6, 54 g/m 2. These results are presumably an affect of the artificially induced oxygen in the bottom water by the hypolimnion unit. The hypolimnion unit is placed in the Bornsjö Basin (BB) on 14 m water deep and through aeration of the bottom water the phosphorus accumulates in the sediment. The oxygen that is brought down to the bottom of the lake forms an aerobic environment near the sediment surface which prevents phosphorus leakage (internal loading). Because of a high amount phosphorus in the sediment of Lake Bornsjön is bound to ferric iron (Fe 3 + or Fe(III)) in aerobic condition, there is a big threat that this phosphorus will be released when Fe(III) will be reduced to Fe(II) and there is a large risk that it will react with SO 42 under anaerobic conditions. The water depth and the location in the lake plays an important role of the amount accumulated phosphorus which is statistically shown in the study. The hypolimnion unit was initiated in 1987 and has since then been active every year between June - October except 2004. Under 2004 a pumping project took place in the Edeby Basin. During this project the bottom water was pumped out of the lake and the result in this rapport show some indications that this project was successful to reduce phosphorus content in Lake Bornsjön. The phosphorus amount in the water during 2006 May-October was 17, 27 μg P/L and by this value the lake is a mesotrophic lake. The results from the comparison between different methods to analyse phosphorus show that the methods give quite similar results but the fractionation method is the most informative method about how phosphorus is connected to other substances and consequently the most adequate method to use to calculate the mobile amount of phosphorus. It can be concluded that the phosphorus in Lake Bornsjön mainly derive from the internal loading of the lake, but also from the diffuse inflow from the arable land surrounding the lake and from the densely populated parts in the drainage area. The hypolimnion unit that artificially induces oxygen in the bottom water and makes the phosphorus accumulate in the sediment is positive because phosphorus stays in the lake and is not transported to other lakes or the Baltic Sea. Bornsjön ligger till största delen i Salems kommun, 3 mil sydväst om Stockholm. Sjön är en sprickdalssjö och består av tre bassänger utsträckta i nordväst-sydostlig riktning. Bornsjöns yta är 6, 7 km 2 med ett maxdjup på 18, 3 m och ett medeldjup på 9, 8 m och omsättningstiden för vattnet är 6, 5 år. Nederbördsområdets area är 42 km 2 och består till stor del av jordbruksmark (ca 1000 ha) och produktiv skogsbruksmark (2500 ha) och inom området finns även återställda och nyanlagda våtmarker. Bornsjön är Stockholms viktigaste reservvattentäkt. Sjön och området runtomkring köptes upp för att skyddas redan 1899 av Stockholms stad, övertogs 1993 av Stockholm Vatten AB. Området kring sjön är sedan 1988 ett vattenskyddsområde, dessa bestämmelser reviderades år 2006 och dessutom godkändes det som naturreservat år 1995. Detta innebär vissa restriktioner såsom förbud att bada, fiska, beträda sjön vintertid och endast vattenvårdsverksamhet får förekomma i och på sjön. Uppgifter från 1970 -talet visade att fosforhalterna i yt- och bottenvattnet ökade för att sedan minska i mitten på 1980 -talet (Lännergren 1996). 1986 visade Bornsjön indikationer på försämrad sjöstatus vilket ledde till en undersökning år 1987 vilket visade en ackumulation av fosfor i sedimentet i sjöns djuphålor (Pettersson 1987). Syftet med denna studie är att utreda den fosforfrigörelse som sker från sedimenten i Bornsjön idag samt att jämföra resultaten med den undersökning som genomfördes 1987. Utredningen har för avsikt att kartlägga var i Bornsjöns tre olika bassänger det läcker mest fosfor från sedimentet till bottenvattnet och förklara varför frigörelsen eventuellt varierar i sjöns olika delar. I studien används tre olika typer av metoder för att fastställa fosformängden, vilket gör att en jämförelse mellan dessa metoder är möjlig. Sammanlagt provtogs 18 sedimentkärnor vid tre olika tillfällen. Sedimentprovtagningen gjordes i anslutning till ordinarie vattenprovtagningar vilket innebär att vattenanalysernas resultat var tillgängliga. Även ett fosforfrigörelseförsök gjordes in vitro där sedimentkärnor med ovanstående vattenpelare inkuberades i 22 dagar. Resultatet av studiens olika delar visar att det finns mest ackumulerad totalfosfor, under 10 meters vattendjup, med en antagen sedimentdensitet på 1 000 000 g/m 3 (muntlig kommunikation Rydin Emil) i Skårbybassängen (BS), 14, 90 g/m 2, men att det finns mest mobil fosfor i Bornsjöbassängen (BB), 7, 08 g/m 2 baserat på data från sedimentlagret 0 - 17 cm. Genomsnittlig totalfosforhalt i sedimentet för hela sjön under 10 meters vattendjup, var vid provtagningstillfället 12, 08 g/m 2 samt mobil fosforhalt på 6, 54 g/m 2. Vad som påverkat detta resultat mest är förmodligen det artificiellt tillförda syret i bottenvattnet som skapats med hjälp av en hypolimnionluftare placerad i Bornsjöbassängen. Genom att syresätta bottenvattnet ackumuleras fosfor i sedimentet. Även vattendjupet och provplatsen i sjön spelar en viktig roll i sammanhanget vilket bevisas statistiskt i studien. Fosformängden i vattenmassan under år 2006 maj-oktober var 17, 27 μg P/L. Vad gäller metodjämförelsen kan konstateras att resultaten följer varandra relativt väl men att fosforfraktionering är den mest informativa metoden då det gäller utredning av fosfor i förhållande till andra ämnen, såsom t. ex. järn, aluminium, kalcium och organiska ämnen. Som slutsats kan konstateras att fosforn i Bornsjön härrör mestadels från internbelastningen i sjön och de diffusa utsläppen som sker då tillflödena till sjön rinner genom näringsrik jordbruksmark men även från de mer tätbebyggda delarna av området...|$|R
