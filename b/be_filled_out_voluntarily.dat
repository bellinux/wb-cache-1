40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: Breast milk has an {{unquestionable}} value. It {{has been}} documented through numerous studies that hospital practices have a decisive impact on successful breastfeeding. The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) has a measurable and proven effect on exclusive breastfeeding. Aim: The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate in which extent the " 10 Steps" for Successful Breastfeeding as well as the International Code for Marketing Substitutes of Breast Milk were implemented through the self-reported experience of mothers. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted during December 2015 to March 2016 and the study population consisted of 152 mothers who had delivered a baby at a public hospital and a private clinic in the city of Chania. Data collection was performed with an anonymous questionnaire that <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>out</b> <b>voluntarily.</b> Results: The level of breastfeeding at discharge was very high (96, 1 %) while the rate of exclusive breastfeeding was 50, 7 %. Based on the self-reported experience of the mothers, the public hospital complies with the 7 th step, that refers to “rooming-in” (91, 4 %), and also with the aspect of the 5 th step, that refers to offering assistance with breastfeeding within six hours of birth (85, 9 %). The private clinic meets the Global Criteria just for one aspect of the 9 th step, that refers to babies being cared without using pacifiers (92, 5 %). Conclusions: The promotion of procedures for the designation of Greek maternity hospitals as “Baby Friendly” is expected to have a significant effect on the establishment of breastfeeding in Greece...|$|R
40|$|Introduction : Despite various formal limitations, an {{increasing}} number of opioid users, especially those stabilised in substitution therapy, travel abroad, away from their permanent residence to neighbouring and remote countries on other continents. Drug users are particularly at risk to get infected with hepatitis A, B, C and HIV during travelling. The main objectives of the study were to identify and determine the frequency of potential travel-related risk behaviour, such as illicit drug use, sharing of injecting equipment, unprotected sex, involvement in criminal activities and the extent of risk in illicit drug users, included in the programmes of the Centers for Prevention and Treatment of Drug Addiction in Slovenia. Methods : The study was carried out in two phases. The first phase included semi-structured interviews conducted in a group of drug users willing to participate in the study. Based on the analysis of transcripts and additional data, the original questionnaire Risky behaviour of illicit drug users during travels <b>was</b> developed and <b>filled</b> in anonymously and on a voluntary basis at the network of Centres for Prevention and Treatment of Drug Addiction. Univariate analysis between independent and dependent factors was conducted based on chi-square test and t-test for independent factors. Multivariate analysis of the impact of independent factors on the dependent factor was conducted based on binary logistic regression. Results : The questionnaire <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>out</b> anonymously and <b>voluntarily</b> by 776 individuals in 14 Slovene centres for prevention and treatment of drug addiction. The results confirmed the first hypothesis that drug users travelling away from their permanent residence are more likely to share their injecting equipment, and engage in unprotected sex and in drug-related crime, and the second hypothesis stating that illegal drug users included in the substitution treatment programmes, who regularly use drugs at home, more often use drugs while travelling than individuals included in the substitution treatment programmes, who never use drugs at home. The hypothesis that illegal drug users who travel abroad more often stop their substitution therapy than those who stay at home was not proven true. Conclusion : The results of quantitative analysis showed a low prevalence of travel-related risk behaviours, including the sharing of injecting equipment, and engaging in unprotected sex and drug-related crime. </p...|$|R
