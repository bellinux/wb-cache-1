5000|$|Dr. Rebecca Mercuri, {{the creator}} of the Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) concept (as {{described}} in her Ph.D. dissertation in October 2000 on the basic voter verifiable ballot system), proposes to answer the auditability question by having the voting machine print a paper ballot or other paper facsimile that can be visually verified by the voter before being entered into a secure location. Subsequently, this is sometimes referred to as the [...] "Mercuri method." [...] To be truly voter-verified, the record itself must be verified by the voter and able to be done without assistance, such as visually or audibly. If the voter must use a <b>bar-code</b> <b>scanner</b> or other electronic device to verify, then the record is not truly voter-verifiable, since it is actually the electronic device that is verifying the record for the voter. VVPAT is the form of Independent Verification most commonly found in elections in the United States and other countries such as Venezuela.|$|E

The source benefits from its extensive coverage in providing data on prices, quantities and values of transactions of each model of a good sold. Relative weights can thus be ascribed to price changes in both base and current months at a highly detailed level which allows us to estimate substitution bias. Methods of adjusting for quality changes can be considered. The dummy variable hedonic approach is compared with a superlative, exact hedonic approach and a matching technique akin to that used by statistical offices...|$|E

System failure would be the biggest acceptance barrier. Secondly, it is critical for companies to establish and strengthen the link between job relevance and the mobile wireless technology, especially at an early adoption phase.

40|$|Statistical offices use the matched models {{method to}} compile {{consumer}} price indices (CPIs) to measure inflation. The prices {{of a sample}} of models are recorded, and then price collectors visit the same stores each subsequent month to record the prices of the same matched sample of models. The matched models method is designed to control for quality changes. But new, unmatched models launched in subsequent months have their prices ignored as do old unmatched models no longer available. The paper uses retailer's <b>bar-code</b> <b>scanner</b> data on several consumer durables to show that serious sample degradation can take place and that the quality-adjusted prices of unmatched items {{differ from those of}} matched ones, leading to substantial underestimates of inflation. Hedonic indices use the whole sample. They are argued to be more useful to price measurement in markets with a rapid turnover of models {{in order to avoid the}} demonstrated bias.

40|$|The surface-micromachined free-space micro-optical bench (FS-MOB) has {{demonstrated}} {{its potential for}} monolithically integrating the entire micro-optical systeims on a single chip [11. Various three-dimensional micro-optical elements such as microlenser;, mirrors, and gratings have been successfully demonstrated [2, 3]. The surface micromachining fabrication process further enables on-chip optical alignment by integrating the free-space micro-optical elements with micropositioners such as translation or rotation stages. Vertically scanning micromirrors have been demonstrated for <b>bar-code</b> <b>scanners</b> [3]. In this paper, we propose a novel integrated XYZ stage with three degrees of freedom for precise on-chip opticail alignment as well as inputloutput coupling for FS-MOB. One application of the integrated XYZ stage is on-chip alignment of hybrid-integrated active optoelectronic components (e. g., semiconductor lasers or photodetectors) in micro-optical systems. Previously, we have demonstrated a self-aligned hybrid integration scheme which utilizes side-mounting approach to match the optical axis of the semiconductor laser {{with that of the}} micro-optical elements [2]. On the other hand, vertical adjustmerit of the optical axis is required in many other applications. Though vertical comb drive has been demonstrated, larg...|$|R
40|$|To {{reverse the}} {{downward}} {{trend in the}} balance of trade, American companies must concentrate on increasing research into new products, boosting productivity, and improving manufacturing processes. The Precision Engineering Center at North Carolina State University is a multidisciplinary research and graduate education program dedicated to providing the new technology necessary to respond to this challenge. One extremely demanding manufacturing area is the fabrication and assembly of optical systems. These systems {{are at the heart of}} such consumer products as cameras, lenses, copy machines, laser <b>bar-code</b> <b>scanners,</b> VCRs, and compact audio discs - products that the Japanese and other East Asian countries are building dominance. A second critical area is the fabrication of VLSI and ULSI circuits. The tolerances required to produce the next generation of components for such systems have created the need for new approaches - approaches that could either make or break America`s competitive position.

40|$|The {{advent of}} <b>bar-code,</b> retail <b>scanner</b> data {{provides}} an alternative data {{source for the}} compilation of consumer price indexes. This paper outlines the nature and merits of such data for this purpose. The data allows aggregation via superlative index number formulae at a very elementary level and provides superior coverage to conventional sources. However, {{it has been argued}} that aggregation bias may still arise if the unit values which feed into the superlative indexes are defined for product items, as opposed to product items for given outlets. We explore for six products the nature and extent of unit value bias by outlet type. For three products we found the level of aggregation did not matter. However, we also found it can matter and established the extent of its effects which were always the aggregation by model only, falling less than by model and outlet. This should help provide a basis for an understanding of the issues at stake in the use of scanner data for the compilation of consumer price indexes...|$|R
