50|$|R.W.Fox's {{influence}} led him {{to relinquish}} painting and to set up as a mathematical instrument maker in Falmouth, where he effected improvements in the miners' dial, and had some share {{in the construction of}} Fox's improved dipping-needle. In 1838 Jordan devised an instrument for recording by photography the variations of the <b>barometric</b> <b>column,</b> and he shortly afterwards invented a declination magnetograph and a self-recording actinometer. His pioneering use of photography in meteorology was acknowledged by both Charles Wheatstone and Sir John Herschel. For some years subsequent to 1839 he held the post of secretary of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, we {{describe}} the observation of self-organized two-dimensional phases composed of simple components having non-trivial shapes which interact only by hard repulsions and are entropically excited. Through experiments and computational modeling, we investigate and explain how certain particle shapes self-organize into interesting two-dimensional phases. In order to obtain large quantities of precisely replicated particles having custom shapes for the experiments, we make a colloidal system composed of lithographically fabricated particles. As a preface to our work for dense systems, we design a novel Fourier tracking method to measure the rotational diffusion of Brownian colloidal polygons confined to two dimensions (2 D) in a dilute dispersion. 	Systems of convex platelet Brownian particles, capable of interdigitation, are osmotically compressed to high densities in a tilted <b>barometric</b> <b>column.</b> An equilibrated alternating stripe crystal (ASX) phase is observed at high particle density. Digital-wide-field-of-view microscopic imaging of the complete column enables us to obtain the 2 D osmotic equation of state for the system and to determine the structural characteristics of the ASX phase which dominates, over a hexagonal crystal (HX) at high densities. 	We introduce and apply a translational-rotational cage model (TRCM) in order to explain the experimentally observed preference for ASX over HX. The TRCM, based on a collision detection routine, determines {{the total number of}} states accessible to a mobile tri-star particle within an ASX and a HX cage. We find that the additional translational states permitted by the ASX phase exceeds the number of additional rotational states permitted by the HX phase, thus setting ASX as the entropically preferred phase. The TRCM is also used to explain the chiral symmetry breaking observed in a system of rhombs which form a rhombic lattice under high osmotic compression. In both cases, the TRCM is able to explain the phase behavior observed where models based on rotations or translations alone could not. We anticipate that future, more sophisticated programs could be designed with the TRCM which, through optimization and feed-back, would be able to make more predictive assessments on similar systems...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between chemical surface treatments on the interior of glass tubes and their resistance to fluid flow. By treating {{the interior of the}} tubes with functional silanes we can decrease or increase the interaction of the tube walls with the fluid column, which translates to changes in fluid column height for a given pressure differential. Resistance to fluid flow is quantified by using the tubes as integral parts of a <b>barometric</b> pressure <b>column</b> and measuring the changes in column height as the fluid is pulled into the tube by a set pressure differential. The barometric pressure system consisted of a closed end manometer attached to the desired tube samples. About 10 mL of fluid were also initially placed in the manometer. Opening the system to atmosphere causes the pressure to equalize, in this way the system acts like a barometer where the fluid travels up the tube. Fluid adhesion to the tube walls transfers a small amount of force, through friction, to the tube walls, which opposes any force pulling the fluid along the surface. The effect is demonstrated with water and hexadecane. Reduced adhesions were observed due to surface treatment. This work provides insight into reducing backpressure when flowing liquids through small pipes...|$|R
