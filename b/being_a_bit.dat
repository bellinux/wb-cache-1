500|$|At {{the end of}} the night, {{the four}} Beatles and some of their guests overdubbed an {{extended}} humming sound to close the song – an idea that they later discarded. According to Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, the tapes from this 10 February orchestral session reveal the guests breaking into loud applause following the second orchestral passage. Among the EMI staff attending the event, one recalled how Ron Richards, the Hollies' producer, was stunned by the music he had heard; in Lewisohn's description, Richards [...] " [...] with his head in his hands, saying 'I just can't believe it … I give up.'"

500|$|Paul Levy, Floyd's obituarist, {{considered}} the broadcaster had [...] "no outstanding talent, {{either as a}} cook or as a TV presenter, no great knowledge of his subject, or any apparent passion for anything but drink. This {{is not to say}} that his first TV programmes were bad – they were, indeed, highly diverting entertainment". The programmes were also highly popular both with the public and other cooks. Following his death of heart disease in September 2009 several fellow chefs voiced their opinions of him. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall considers that Floyd [...] "cooked his ingredients with the love and passion of a gifted amateur", while Heston Blumenthal opines that [...] "His enthusiasm, even when he was <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> crotchety, jumped out of the screen.

Peter Ross of The Scotsman cites another interview, {{in which she was}} repeatedly questioned about her views on the UK Trident programme. But he describes her in person as [...] "articulate, reflective, self-deprecating and at times very funny. It would be unfair to condemn her for not being a sound-bite politician; she ought to be applauded for it, but the trouble is we live in a sound-bite age." [...] Mandy Rhodes of Holyrood magazine writes, [...] "despite a reputation as <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a fierce one, [...] is actually, really rather entertaining, engaging and wonderfully self-deprecating."

Alexandre Dumas has the strongest of the Three Musketeers, Porthos, mention [...] "Milo of Crotona" [...] {{saying that he had}} replicated a list of his feats of strength - all except breaking a cord tied around the head, whereupon d'Artagnan tells Porthos that it is because his strength is not in his head (a joke about Porthos <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> dim-witted).|$|E

Online ranked Miss Rosa as the third best character from season two. The character's backstory was her favourite. She said that a [...] "cursed bank robber" [...] sounded corny, but worked well. Hilary Busis of Entertainment Weekly described the character as a forgettable non-entity during the first season. She also praised Stephanie Andujar's performance as Young Rosa and called for her own spin-off series to be created. Kimberley Potts of Yahoo! TV voted Miss Rosa's backstory as the second best one of the entire show.

Karma scored 81 points less than the leading competitor, South Korea's Choi Mi-sun. On 8 August she competed in the Round of 64 and was drawn against Tuyana Dashidorzhieva of Russia, the fifth ranking athlete in the ranking round. Karma tied with Dashidorzhieva in the first set before the Russian outscored her by three points to secure the second set. Karma and Dashidorzieva tied with each other in the game's following two sets until the Russian won the final set to win the match. This meant Karma was eliminated from the competition. After the events ended, Karma stated that despite being defeated she enjoyed the match and wanted to compete with archery champions whether she won or lost: [...] "I remember <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> nervous with the big cameras in the blinds.

More cautious scholars prefer to note him as involved in initiatives [...] "linked to Carlist legitimism", some settle for a general [...] "Catholic conservative counter-revolutionary" [...] and most opt for [...] "Traditionalist intellectual". By opponents he was considered a [...] "Catholic integrist" [...] and [...] "ultra-conservative", the latter <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of an understatement.

In December 2006, the BBC complaints department upheld the complaint of four Top Gear viewers that Clarkson had used the phrase [...] "ginger beer" [...] (rhyming slang for [...] "queer") in a derogatory manner, when Clarkson picked up on and agreed with an audience member's description of the Daihatsu Copen as <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> [...] "gay".

2500|$|Jade {{debuted in}} Mortal Kombat II as a green palette swap of Kitana with darker skin and gold-tinted duplicates of her steel fans, which reverted to their {{original}} color upon being thrown. Ed Boon said she was initially just [...] "an evil version of Kitana, in a sense." [...] While the game was in development, the team wanted to add a secret character based on Katalin Zamiar, who had already been filmed performing as Kitana and Mileena; Jade was created in what Zamiar described as a mostly [...] "on the spot" [...] fashion. Zamiar's outfit used for filming the female ninja characters was blue, and presented some challenges for the actress during filming, such as the bottoms of the leggings <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too slippery for moves such as jump kicks and the tops having to be held up with rubber bands, while her mask was taped to her nose {{to keep it in}} place. Zamiar did not return for Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 due to brewing legal issues with Midway, and was replaced by actress Becky Gable. At that point, Jade was given a staff weapon to further separate her from Kitana and Mileena. In the 2011 reboot game, Jade also has classic palette-swapped outfits from the 1990s as some of her alternate costumes, and there is even a secret special encounter battle against her wielding Kitana's fans just like in Mortal Kombat II.|$|E

Gable was videotaped in a more revealing red outfit to stand out from the blue screen more. Kitana first appeared unmasked in her 3D graphics model in Mortal Kombat Gold. Until Gold, she, Mileena and Jade all wore the same costume, differing from each other through palette swapping (purple for Mileena and green for Jade) to create their digitized sprite graphics. Kitana's main costume in Mortal Kombat X is less skimpy than it has been usually in the previous games. Developer NetherRealm Studios stated they [...] "wanted {{to come up with something}} exciting and fresh for her look in Mortal Kombat X. Past incarnations have tended to favor the royal qualities of the character over the warrior aspects, so we decided to reverse that for her costume. She has a stealthier, more ninja inspired design with blue as an accent color against the black parts of her costume."
