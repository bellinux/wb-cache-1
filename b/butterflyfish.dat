5|$|Open water {{fish are}} usually {{streamlined}} like torpedoes to minimize turbulence {{as they move}} through the water. Reef fish live in a complex, relatively confined underwater landscape and for them, manoeuvrability {{is more important than}} speed, and many of them have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction. Many have laterally compressed bodies (flattened from side to side) allowing them to fit into fissures and swim through narrow gaps; some use their pectoral fins for locomotion and others undulate their dorsal and anal fins. Some fish have grown dermal (skin) appendages for camouflage; the prickly leather-jacket is almost invisible among the seaweed it resembles and the tasselled scorpionfish invisibly lurks on the seabed ready to ambush prey. Some like the foureye <b>butterflyfish</b> have eyespots to startle or deceive, while others such as lionfish have aposematic coloration to warn that they are toxic or have venomous spines.|$|E
25|$|Sea anemones {{are common}} on reefs. The tentacles of sea anemones bristle with tiny {{harpoons}} (nematocysts) primed with toxins, and are an effective deterrent against most predators. However, saddle <b>butterflyfish,</b> which {{are up to}} 30cm (12in) long, have developed a resistance to these toxins. Saddle <b>butterflyfish</b> usually flutter gently rather than swim. But {{in the presence of}} their preferred food, sea anemones, this gentleness disappears, and the <b>butterflyfish</b> dash in and out, ripping off the anemone tentacles.|$|E
40|$|Extract] Considerable {{research}} {{attention has}} focused on the feeding habits of coral reef <b>butterflyfishes,</b> especially Chaetodon <b>butterflyfishes</b> (reviewed by Cole et al., 2008), largely due to their propensity to feed on corals (more specifically, reef-building scleractinian corals). Coral feeding infers a very high dependence upon living corals, which has led to suggestions that changes in the-abundance (or behaviour) of <b>butterflyfishes</b> may provide an effective indicator for declines in coral cover (e. g., Khalaf and Crosby, 2005; Gochfeld, 2006), or even declining condition of entire coral reef ecosystems (Reese, 1977; Hourigan et al., 1988; Crosby and Reese, 1996, 2005). <b>Butterflyfishes,</b> especially highly specialised coral-feeding species, are certainly sensitive to changes in the availability of scleractinian corals (e. g., Crosby and Reese, 2005; Samways, 2005; Pratchett et al., 2006; Graham, 2007; Wilson et al., Chapter 14). However, responses of <b>butterflyfishes</b> to coral loss are very complex, highly species-specific, and often delayed, which greatly reduces their effectiveness as indicators of coral health (Crosby et al., Chapter 10). Variation in dietary breadth and composition among <b>butterflyfishes,</b> which determines coral-dependence, is nonetheless very important in understanding inherent vulnerabilities of <b>butterflyfishes</b> to sustained and ongoing coral loss associated with the worldwide degradation of coral reef ecosystems (Pratchett et al., 2008 a, Pratchett, Chapter 6) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} dietary selection among 14 {{species of}} coral-feeding <b>butterflyfishes</b> at Lizard Island in the Northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. All 14 <b>butterflyfishes</b> studied (Chaetodon aureofasciatus, C. baronessa, C. citrinellus, C. kleinii, C. lunula, C. lunulatus, C. melannotus, C. plebeius, C. rafflesii, C. rainfordi, C. speculum, C. trifascialis, C. ulietensis and C. unimaculatus) exhibited significant dietary selection, consuming {{one or more}} coral species disporportionately to their availability. The most selective of these <b>butterflyfishes</b> was C. trifascialis, which selectively consumed Acropora corals (especially A. hyacinthus) {{to the exclusion of}} other prey corals. There were notable differences in the degree of selectivity exhibited among coral-feeding <b>butterflyfishes,</b> but there was a high degree of concordance in their apparent feeding preferences. Notably, most coral-feeding <b>butterflyfishes</b> predominantly selected A. hyacinthus and secondarily Pocillopora damicornis. Observed selectivity in the dietary habits of coral-feeding <b>butterflyfishes</b> may influence their spatial and temporal patterns of abundance and is likely to be fundamental in determining their responses to major disturbances (e. g. climate-induced coral bleaching), which alter the availability of different corals...|$|R
40|$|<b>Butterflyfishes</b> (family Chaetodontidae) are {{a highly}} {{conspicuous}} component of fish fauna on coral reefs throughout the world. In {{light of their}} strong dependence on coral, they are often regarded as the epitome of coral reef fishes. This volume examines the ecology and conservation of coral reef <b>butterflyfishes.</b> It provides important insights on their evolution and key events and adaptations {{that have led to}} their proliferation within coral reef ecosystems. Key to the longevity of <b>butterflyfishes</b> is the evolution of coral-feeding—a central focus of the ecological chapters in this volume. The book also highlights key threats and challenges related to the conservation of <b>butterflyfishes</b> and ends with an overview of current and future research directions...|$|R
25|$|<b>Butterflyfish</b> {{look like}} smaller {{versions}} of angelfish (Pomacanthidae), but unlike these, lack preopercle spines at the gill covers. Some {{members of the}} genus Heniochus resemble the Moorish idol (Zanclus cornutus) of the monotypic Zanclidae. Among the paraphyletic Perciformes, the former are probably not too distantly related to <b>butterflyfish,</b> whereas the Zanclidae seem far less close.|$|E
25|$|There is a mutualistic {{relationship}} between sea anemones and clownfish. This gives the sea anemones a second line of defence. They are guarded by fiercely territorial clownfish, {{who are also}} immune to the anemone toxins. To get their meal, <b>butterflyfish</b> must get past these protective clownfish who, although smaller, are not intimidated. An anemone without its clownfish will quickly be eaten by <b>butterflyfish.</b> In return, the anemones provide the clownfish protection from their predators, who are not immune to anemone stings. As a further benefit to the anemone, waste ammonia from the clownfish feed symbiotic algae found in the anemone's tentacles.|$|E
25|$|Many reef fish, such as <b>butterflyfish</b> and angelfishes, {{have evolved}} bodies which are deep and {{laterally}} compressed like a pancake. Their pelvic and pectoral fins are designed differently, so they act {{together with the}} flattened body to optimise manoeuvrability.|$|E
40|$|Extract] In his {{preface to}} a special issue (and {{dedicated}} workshop) on the biology of <b>butterflyfishes,</b> Motta (1989) suggested that <b>butterflyfishes</b> have received disproportionate scientific attention compared to other common and conspicuous families of coral reef fishes. In support of this assertion, the number of scientific publications that consider <b>butterflyfishes</b> (151 Web of Knowledge; 382 publications since 1927) is far greater than for many other families of nominal reef fishes (e. g., angelfishes, surgeonfishes, and rabbitfishes); the only families that have been more intensively studied are the Pomacentridae (damselfishes), Serranidae (groupers) and Labridae (parrot fishes and wrasses), which probably reflects their high diversity, commercial and functional importance, respectively. In this respect, research on <b>butterflyfishes</b> has contributed greatly to genera l understanding of the biology and ecology of coral reef fishes (e. g., Almany et al., 2007; Lawton et al., 2011). The fields of research in which <b>butterflyfishes</b> have played essential roles also extends well beyond the notion that <b>butterflyfishes</b> are "indicators" of overall reef health, which is the usual justification for studying this relatively unique group of reef fishes (e. g., Ohman et al., 1998; Bozec et al., 2005; Shokri et al., 2005) ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the dietary habits and functional composition of <b>butterflyfishes</b> in the Chagos Archipelago, central Indian Ocean. Eighteen species of <b>butterflyfishes</b> were recorded in Chagos, including six obligate corallivores (Chaetodon bennetti, Chaetodon guttatissimus, Chaetodon meyeri, Chaetodon trifascialis, Chaetodon trifasciatus and Chaetodon zanzibarensis), five facultative corallivores (Chaetodon auriga, Chaetodon falcula, Chaetodon interruptus, Chaetodon kleinii and Chaetodon madagaskariensis), two non-corallivores (Chaetodon lunula and Chaetodon xanthocephalus) and a further five species (Chaetodon citrinellus, Chaetodon lineolatus, Heimitaurichthys zoster, Heniochus monoceros and Forcipiger flavissimus), for which local dietary habits were not studied. There were marked differences in the abundance of <b>butterflyfishes</b> among sites and between reef zones, mostly associated with variation in abundance of scleractinian corals. Obligate coral-feeding species (mostly C. trifascialis) dominated across all sites. This study suggests that coral feeding {{and high levels of}} dietary specialization contribute to high population-level fitness among coral reef <b>butterflyfishes.</b> Despite being more vulnerable to habitat disturbances and coral loss, it appears likely that specialist coral-feeding <b>butterflyfishes</b> are also much more resilient to occasional disturbances, and therefore dominate {{in a wide range of}} coral reef habitats...|$|R
25|$|Freshwater <b>butterflyfish</b> ({{possibly}} gliding). Pantodon buchholzi has {{the ability}} to jump and possibly glide a short distance. It can move through the air several times the length of its body. While it does this, the fish flaps its large pectoral fins, giving it its common name. However, it is debated whether the freshwater butterfly fish can truly glide, Saidel et al. (2004) argue that it cannot.|$|E
25|$|<b>Butterflyfish</b> are pelagic spawners; that is, they release many buoyant {{eggs into}} the water, which {{become part of}} the plankton, {{floating}} with the currents until hatching. The fry go through a tholichthys stage, wherein the body of the postlarval fish is covered in large, bony plates extending from the head. They lose their bony plates as they mature. Only one other family of fish, the scats (Scatophagidae) express such an armored stage.|$|E

25|$|The {{bar jack}} is a benthopelagic predator, taking its prey both in {{midwater}} {{and along the}} seafloor. The diet consists mostly of fish, up to 90% of the fishes intake in some studies, with planktonic crustaceans and small cephalopods taken in minor volumes. There is significant change in diet with age in fish studied off Cuba, which may reduce intraspecific competition in the species. Young fish prefer planktonic organisms, predominantly decapod and fish larvae; fish reaching sexual maturity prey on shrimp and small fish, while mature fish feed almost exclusively on small fish. The fish species preferred by bar jack appear to be mostly small sand dwellers such as blennies and gobies or small reef dwellers including wrasses, <b>butterflyfish</b> and filefish, with the diet of the latter leading to the accumulation of coral derived ciguatera toxin in the jack's flesh. Other lesser taken prey items include gastropods, nematodes and benthic algae {{as well as a}} range of crustaceans.|$|E
25|$|Most of Australia's {{fish species}} are marine, and 75% live in {{tropical}} marine environments. This is {{partly due to}} Australia's huge marine territory, covering 9 million km2. Groups of interest include the moray eels and squirrelfish, as well as the pipefish and seahorses, whose males incubate their partner's eggs in a specialised pouch. There are 80 species of grouper in Australian waters, including one of the world's biggest bony fish, the giant grouper, which can grow as large as 2.7m and weigh up to 400kg. The trevally, a group of 50 species of silver schooling fish, and the snappers are popular species for commercial fishing. The Great Barrier Reef supports a huge variety of small- and medium-sized reef fish, including the damselfish, <b>butterflyfish,</b> angelfish, gobies, cardinalfish, wrassees, triggerfish and surgeonfish. There are several venomous fish, among them several species of stonefish and pufferfish and the red lionfish, all of which have toxins that can kill humans. There are 11 venomous species of stingray, the largest of which is the smooth stingray. The barracudas are one of the reef's largest species. However, large reef fish should not be eaten for fear of ciguatera poisoning.|$|E
500|$|In {{the lagoon}} there are around 138 fish species, which also inhabit southeastern Oceania, the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean. The lagoon is {{noted for its}} {{poisonous}} fishes and dangerous sharks. The yellow-edged lyretail, the blacktip grouper, and the greasy grouper are known to cause ciguatera poisoning. The lagoon is also inhabited by Galápagos sharks and the whitetip reef shark. [...] The Galápagos shark is dangerous to humans, while the whitetips are seldom aggressive unless provoked. Five species are found exclusively around the Pitcairn Islands: Sargocentron megalops (a species of squirrelfish), the spiny <b>butterflyfish,</b> the Henderson triplefin (a species of threefin blenny), an unnamed species of Alticus (a genus of combtooth blenny) and an unnamed species of Ammodytes (a genus of sand lance).|$|E
40|$|Interactions between {{predators and}} prey organisms are of {{fundamental}} importance to ecological communities. While the ecological impact that grazing predators can have in terrestrial and temperate marine systems are well established, {{the importance of}} coral grazers on tropical reefs has rarely been considered. In this study we estimate the biomass of coral tissue consumed by four prominent species of corallivorous <b>butterflyfishes.</b> Sub-adult <b>butterflyfishes</b> (60 - 70 mm, 6 - 11 g) remove between 0. 6 and 0. 9 g of live coral tissue per day, while larger adults (> 110 mm, ~ 40 - 50 g) remove between 1. 5 and 3 g of coral tissue each day. These individual consumption rates correspond to the population of coral-feeding <b>butterflyfishes</b> at three exposed reef crest habitats at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef consuming between 14. 6 g (± 2. 0) and 19. 6 g (± 3. 9). 200 m- 2. day- 1 of coral tissue. When standardised to the biomass of <b>butterflyfishes</b> present, a combined reef wide removal rate of 4. 2 g (± 1. 2) of coral tissue is consumed per 200 m- 2. kg- 1 of coral-feeding <b>butterflyfishes.</b> The quantity of coral tissue removed by these predators is considerably larger than previously expected and indicates that coral-grazers are likely {{to play an important}} role in the transfer of energy fixed by corals to higher consumers. Chronic coral consumption by <b>butterflyfishes</b> is expected to exact a large energetic cost upon prey corals and contribute to an increased rate of coral loss on reefs already threatened by anthropogenic pressure and ongoing climate change...|$|R

2500|$|The foureye <b>butterflyfish</b> {{gets its}} name from a large dark spot on the rear portion of {{each side of the}} body. This spot is {{surrounded}} by a brilliant white ring, resembling an eyespot. A black vertical bar on the head runs through the true eye, making it hard to see. This can result in a predator thinking the fish is bigger than it is, and confusing the back end with the front end. The butterflyfish's first instinct when threatened is to flee, putting the false eyespot closer to the predator than the head. [...] Most predators aim for the eyes, and this false eyespot tricks the predator into believing that the fish will flee tail first. When escape is not possible, the <b>butterflyfish</b> will sometimes turn to face its aggressor, head lowered and spines fully erect, like a bull about to charge.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a 2 month {{study of the}} patterns of abundance, feeding pressure, diet and feeding selectivity in corallivorous tubelip wrasses (Labridae), rarely studied, yet widespread and abundant group of corallivores on Indo-Pacific coral reefs. The relative abundance and feeding pressure of corallivorous wrasses and <b>butterflyfishes</b> (Chaetodontidae) in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, were compared. Overall, tubelip wrasses were {{more than twice as}} abundant as corallivorous <b>butterflyfishes</b> and accounted for three times as many feeding bites on corals. The three most abundant tubelip wrasses (yellowtail tubelip Diproctacanthus xanthurus, Allen's tubelip Labropsis alleni and the tubelip wrasse Labrichthys unilineatus) were all obligate corallivores taking > 97 % of bites from the surface of live corals. Labropsis alleni and D. xanthurus were highly selective, consuming preferred prey species in proportions significantly higher than expected given their availability. In contrast, L. unilineatus was fairly non-selective and consumed most corals in direct accordance with their availability. As coral predators, tubelip wrasses are highly comparable to coral-feeding <b>butterflyfishes</b> in the coral species consumed, range of dietary specialization and their reliance on live coral. Tubelip wrasses, however, may supersede <b>butterflyfishes</b> as the predominant corallivorous family in some Indo-Pacific locations, and coral-feeding tubelip wrasses are likely to be severely affected by coral decline...|$|R
