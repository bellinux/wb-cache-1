50|$|<b>Ballotini</b> is a cane {{technique}} in which several vetro a fili canes are picked up while laid side-by-side {{rather than a}} bundle, with a clear glass gather over them. This gather is shaped into a cylinder with the canes directed along the axis, so that the canes form a sort of “fence” across {{the diameter of the}} cylinder. When this is simultaneously twisted and pulled, the resulting cane has a helix of threads across its thickness.|$|E
40|$|Dissertação mest., Aquacultura e Pescas, Universidade do Algarve, 2009 The general aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the underlying factors responsible for the individual variation in growth of juvenile Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis). Senegalese sole is a species of high commercial value and high interest for aquaculture in Europe, therefore it would be important to understand these individual variations. Understanding the causes for individual variation in growth in relation with the feed intake, metabolic rate and response to stress contributes to maximize the production efficiency by reducing food waste and improving water quality. In order to identify the possible factors responsible for the individual variation in sole growth, its relationship with metabolic rate, stress response and feed intake was determined. Twelve fish with 18. 49 ± 2. 94 g of initial weight were kept in standard conditions and feed once a day, during a period of six months. Individual oxygen consumption measurements in Sole juveniles were determined by flow-through respirometry at standard conditions, after the fish were fed a single meal and after a stressful condition. Blood samples for plasma cortisol, were taken from all fish at the start of the experiment (control, indicative of basal levels) and after stress exposure. Quantification of individual feed intake was performed by incorporation with radio-opaque <b>ballotinis</b> glass beads in a dry feed, followed by radiography to quantify the amount of ingested pellets. Individual fish exhibited pronounced variation in growth (final weight ranging from 30. 45 to 67. 53 g), oxygen consumption of fasted fish (108. 0 to 447. 4 μmol/g/h), oxygen consumption of fed fish (174. 7 μmol/g/h to 813. 5 μmol/g/h), oxygen consumption after emersion stress (186. 8 μmol/g/h to 376. 7 μmol/g/h), and plasma cortisol after emersion stress (4. 81 ng/ml to 46. 45 ng/ml). Individual differences in metabolic rate do not contribute to explain individual differences in growth. However, after emersion stress individual differences in stress response seem to play a role in explaining individual differences in growth, what may result from different copying styles. Sole feed intake as measured by X-ray does not seem to be a good indicator of growth rate. The oxygen consumption increases both when fish are fed and after an emersion stress, as result of additive costs of growth and stress to the cost of maintenance. All together, this study suggests that individual variation of growth in Solea senegalensis is essentially due to genetic variation, and its reduction may accomplished when genetic selection programs are adopted. Furthermore, a study with a larger number of fish and over a larger time period would be important to check some of the trends found in this thesis between growth potential, metabolic rate and coping styles of Senegalese sole...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental study examining {{the influence of}} the mechanical and geometrical properties of the constituent grains on the overall material response of cohesionless granular materials. Glass <b>ballotini</b> were used as an analogue soil; their relatively simple geometry allowed the influence of particle shape and inter-particle friction to be examined independently. Techniques were developed to control the surface roughness of the <b>ballotini</b> to facilitate a parametric study. The particle shape was also varied by crushing the <b>ballotini.</b> At the micro-scale, the particle characterization included accurate measurements of inter-particle friction, contact stiffness, particle surface roughness, and particle shape. At the macro-scale the sensitivity of overall material response to changes in surface roughness and geometry was characterized using triaxial tests and oedometer tests on smooth spherical <b>ballotini,</b> roughened <b>ballotini</b> and crushed angular <b>ballotini.</b> Compression tests indicated that the initial load deformation response at particle-particle contact points is significantly softer than previously believed. Optical interferometry of particles after single particle-particle shearing tests confirmed that plastic strains occurred at the contact point, which were related to plastic yield. A Hertzian response was only seen at higher contact loads. A clear relationship between the inter-particle friction and the particle surface roughness was found. However, the macro-scale experiments indicated that while the material response may be slightly dependant on the surface roughness and friction, the influence of particle shape is very much more significant. ...|$|E
40|$|A new {{apparatus}} {{is described}} that measures interparticle friction between sand-sized grains over relatively large displacements and also under immersion in a fluid. Its relatively simple design allows the key calibrations {{to be checked}} by statics. An analysis of the geometry of simple spherical particle contacts and the forces at those contacts revealed that there are strict constraints on the permissible stiffness of the interparticle friction apparatus to avoid stick-slip behaviour. Tests on ball bearings gave highly repeatable data, while others on glass <b>ballotini</b> revealed a significant effect of ambient humidity on the data obtained. The interparticle friction was found to increase with the roughness of the <b>ballotini.</b> Immersion in water increased the interparticle friction slightly for both the <b>ballotini</b> and quartz sand particles, while immersion in oil reduced the friction considerably for the quartz sand, especially at higher contact force levels...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of a granular ensemble at a macro scale is an {{integration of the}} interparticle interactions. Even though manifold parameters at multiple length scales govern the behaviour of granular materials, particle shape and size are considered paramount in governing the ensemble level mechanical response such as the strength, stiffness and packing fraction (e(max), e(min)), friction angle etc. In this research programme, an experimental study using hollow cylinder apparatus is undertaken in order to study the effect of particle shape on the ensemble material behaviour. Two model materials are chosen for these series of experiments - angular sand and spherical glass <b>ballotini.</b> The mean grain size of both sand and glass <b>ballotini</b> {{used in this study}} is 0. 5 mm. Also the specimens are prepared at a relative density of 30 % using the same preparation technique, ensuring almost similar initial fabric. These specimens are subjected to a gamut of stresses by varying the intermediate principal stress ratio (b) such that the critical state surface (or yield locus) could be traced on an octahedral plane (in the principal stress space). The angular particles showed increased critical state strength when compared to the glass <b>ballotini</b> at different intermediate principal stress ratio. The volume change in the angular sand particles are seen to be mostly contractive, while at the same relative density, the glass <b>ballotini</b> showed a dilative response. Finally, the particle shape controls the size of the critical state locus on the octahedral plane, in that, the angular particles show an increased size when compared to the spherical particles...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} particle morphology (grain shape) on the mechanical response of granular materials. Two model systems with extreme differences in morphology were selected (spherical glass <b>ballotini</b> and angular sand) for this experimental programme. A series of hollow cylinder torsion tests were conducted in this programme under monotonic drained conditions on specimens reconstituted to the same relative density. Tests were conducted under different intermediate principal stress ratio (b) on both the model materials. The glass <b>ballotini</b> shows increased dilation {{at the outset of}} the test, however, at large strains, the particle rearrangement in the sand and the increased interlocking leads to higher strength at the critical state. The effect of individual particle morphology is manifested in both the increased friction angle and a larger sized failure locus in stress space with increase in angularity. The stresses developed in these two model materials are also accompanied by intriguing volume change behaviour. The glass <b>ballotini</b> despite a lower strength presents a predominantly dilative response immaterial of the ` b' value, while the angular sand shows increased strength at large strains, while showing a contractive response. These results allow incorporation of particle morphology effects at the ensemble level in plasticity based constitutive models...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which drops of secondary liquid dispersion ie. < 100 μ m, are collected, coalesced and transferred have been studied in particulate beds of different sizes and heights of glass <b>ballotini.</b> The apparatus facilitated different coalescer cell arrangements. The liquid-liquid system was toluene/de-ionised water. The inlet drop size distribution was measured by microscopy and using the Malvern Particle Size analyser; the outlet dispersion was sized by photography. The effect of packed height and packing size upon critical velocity, pressure drop and coalescence efficiency have been investigated. Single and two phase flow pressure drops across the packing were correlated by modified Blake-Kozeny equations. Two phase pressure drop was correlated by two equations, one for large <b>ballotini</b> sizes (267 μm - 367 μm), the other for small <b>ballotini</b> sizes (93 μm- 147. 5 μm). The packings were efficient coalescers up to critical velocities of 3 x 10 - 2 m/s to 5 x 10 - 2 m/s. The saturation was measured across the bed using relative permeability and a mathematical model developed which related this profile to measured pressure drops.

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{industrial}} processes such as water purification, fractionation, solids removal or recovery, and dewatering can be performed using synthetic membrane filtrations. The performance of these membrane processes deteriorate over time due to the deposition of unwanted fouling layers upon, or within, the membrane, causing declining permeate flux, increased operational cost, and shortened membrane life. In this research, an Automated micro-Fluid Dynamic Gauging (AmFDG) technique has been designed, constructed and used to study cake fouling during cross-flow microfiltration of <b>ballotini</b> and LignoboostTM softwood Kraft lignin suspensions through mixed cellulose ester membranes of 0. 2 micron nominal pore size. Thickness of the cake layers were measured in situ and in real time during fouling. AmFDG was also used to perform strength tests on preformed cakes, by imposing controlled fluid shear stresses to the layer and measuring the thickness following deformation. Ballotini-Lignin mixtures were found to produce considerably thicker layers compared with lignin only fouling layers. Interestingly, the addition of <b>ballotini</b> reduced the lignin fouling layers’ strength significantly...|$|E
40|$|The {{deposition}} of fouling layers on porous surfaces {{such as those}} experienced in membrane/filtration systems has been investigated using the technique of fluid dynamic gauging (FDG). In this work, dead end micro- and macrofiltration processes were simulated using filter paper and glass <b>ballotini</b> suspensions. FDG was used to track, in situ and in real time, the build-up of a <b>ballotini</b> cake during the filtration process. The permeate flux through the filter paper was also simultaneously monitored. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies were performed to illuminate the fluid dynamics of FDG, with particular focus on the flow patterns and on the stresses imposed on the porous surface. The governing Navier-Stokes, Darcy's and continuity equations were solved using the Augmented Lagrangian Method implemented by the commercial partial differential equation solver, Fasflo (TM).

The model is also on other assumptions which imposes several limitations {{the accuracy of the}} predicted results. These limitations the objectives of the experimental investigation of particle trajectories which was carried out in a 30. 0 section of an axisymmetric helicopter inertial separator. The separator section was fully instrumented with pressure tappings to determine the near-wall flow condition. The flowfield at the central (vertical) plane of separator was also measured with a two spot laser anemometer. The dust particles used in the tests were the spherical <b>ballotini</b> and irregular quartz particles with diameter ranging f-rom 15. 0 to 150. 0 microns. These particles seeded locally into the separator at three initial positions. The restitution ratios for the quartz particle based on experimental data and the <b>ballotini</b> particle's were based on a simple relation, which was derived by and error matching of predicted and experimental results. The particle trajectories, velocities and angles in separator were measured at several stations using the anemometer. The measured results were compared with predicted values from the model which has been modified accept both the experimentally measured and inviscid flowfield. The particle shape factor was also included to account for the higher drag on the non-spherical particle. Further modification was also made to include the restitution ratios of the <b>ballotini</b> particle. Good agreement found between measured and predicted particle trajecto- velocities and angles for both the spherical and non- spherical particle. The trajectories of the large particles (> 100.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with the interaction between a gaseous dispersion of fine particles travelling in the horizontal direction and discrete drops of water falling vertically through the dispersion. A simple analytical model of the particle-drop collision was developed to describe the particle recovery by the drops {{as a function of}} the water flux, covering two extremes of relative velocity between the particles and drops. The Discrete Element Method was used to validate the analytical model. Further validation of the model and insights were obtained through experimental studies. The physical process of wetting was observed to be important in influencing the tendency of particles to become engulfed by the drops of water, or to either adhere to the drops or by-pass the drops altogether. Hydrophilic particles were readily engulfed while hydrophobic particles, at best, adhered to the surface of the drop, or failed to attach. Moreover, the recovery of the hydrophilic silica particles was significantly higher than the recovery of hydrophobic coal particles, with the selectivity ratio approximately 1. 5. Spherical <b>ballotini</b> particles were the most sensitive, with a notable increase in recovery when cleaned, and evidence of increased recovery with increasing particle size. The recovery of irregular shaped silica flour particles, however, was largely independent of the particle size. A similar result was observed for irregular coal particles, though the recoveries were all lower than relatively more hydrophilic <b>ballotini</b> or silica flour...|$|E

40|$|Mountain forests {{can protect}} people and {{infrastructure}} from snow avalanches in a cost-effective way. In this thesis, we have {{carried out a}} series of small-scale chute experiments to study the braking effect of trees on snow avalanches. We assume that the avalanche releases above the forest and that the trees are not broken or bent upon impact of the avalanche. The chute consists of three straight sections: an upper or acceleration section 0. 2 m wide and 1. 5 m long, a middle or forest section 1. 0 m wide and 2. 0 m long consisting of three aluminium plates with a rectangular grid of pre-drilled holes, and a lower or runout zone 1. 0 m wide and 2. 0 m long. The inclination of both the upper and the middle section is 35 °, while the lower section is inclined at 10 °. The avalanche is released from a container {{at the top of the}} upper section. The snow is modelled by glass beads (<b>ballotini)</b> with a diameter of 0. 1 mm. The trees are modelled by metal pins that are inserted into the aluminium plates in computer-generated random patterns. The experiments were ﬁlmed from above and from the side with a frame rate of 60 fps. A total of 54 experiments have been carried out: twelve reference experiments without a forest, of which six were carried out at the beginning and six at the end of the study, and 42 experiments with a forest. We have varied the following three parameters: the velocity at which the avalanche hits the forest (incident front velocity), the stem diameter of the trees, and the forest density. The incident front velocity was varied by varying the mass of the avalanche. Three different masses of <b>ballotini</b> were used: 2 kg, 4 kg, and 6 kg. We used two different stem diameters. The metal pins with a diameter of 3. 2 mm were used as the thinner trees. For the thicker trees, plastic tubes with an outer diameter of 6 mm were threaded onto the metal pins. The forest density was varied by varying the number of metal pins inserted into the aluminium plates. The forest density is 100 % if there is a metal pin inserted into every pre-drilled hole. Four different densities were used: 10 %, 25 %, 50 %, and 90 %. We have measured the front velocity and the ﬂow depth of the avalanche along the forest section of the chute by analyzing the ﬁlms manually frame-by-frame. Further, the runout distance was measured with a ruler straight after each experiment. We have given a detailed phenomenological description of the ﬂow of the avalanche throughthe forest. We have observed two main phenomena that have a braking effect on the avalanche: (1) the creation of large fans in the ﬁrst row of trees that slow down a large amount of the <b>ballotini</b> and (2) the creation of smaller fans further down the chute that spread the <b>ballotini</b> sideways. The larger the mass of <b>ballotini,</b> the larger the fans. The relative effect of each phenomenon depends on the density of the forest. As the forest density increases from 0 % to 100 %, the amount of <b>ballotini</b> that are slowed down upon entering the forest increases, while the degree of lateral spreading decreases. The optimal combination of the two phenomena occurs around a forest density of 50 %. For a stem diameter of 6 mm, the fans in the ﬁrst row are larger than for 3. 2 mm, while the fans further down the chute are of about the same size as for 3. 2 mm. Therefore, the amount of <b>ballotini</b> that are slowed down upon entering the forest is greater for 6 mm than for 3. 2 mm, while the degree of lateral spreading is the same for both stem diameters. We have plotted proﬁles of the front velocity of the avalanche for both the reference experiments and the forest experiments. The front velocity does not differ signiﬁcantly between the reference experiments and the forest experiments. Further, we have plotted proﬁles of the ﬂow depth of the avalanche and compared the ﬂow depth for the different masses, the different stem diameters, and the different forest densities. The ﬂow depth is greatest for a mass of 6 kg, followed by 4 kg and 2 kg, and is greater for a stem diameter of 6 mm than for 3. 2 mm. The ﬂow depth increases from the front of the avalanche, attains a maximum, and decreases again towards the tail. For a forest density of 10 %, the ﬂow depth both increases and decreases most rapidly. The ﬂow depth is greatest for 10 % at ﬁrst, but after some time, the ﬂow depths for 25 % and 50 % become greater. For 90 %, the ﬂow depth is smallest at all times. We have plotted the runout distance for each experiment as a function of the forest density and ﬁtted quadratic trendlines for each mass and each stem diameter. The runout distance decreases from 0 % through to 50 %, but increases again slightly from 50 % to 90 %. In summary, a forest has a maximum braking effect for forest densities around 50 % where trees grow quite densely high up in the avalanche path, slowing down the bulk of the snow, and more openly further down the chute so that the snow can be spread sideways. The braking effect is greatest for mature forests where the trees have larger stem diameters than in younger forests. The larger the avalanche, the greater the braking effect of the forest...|$|E
40|$|A {{conventional}} {{bridge abutment}} utilises bearings {{to support the}} bridge deck, and expansion joints {{to allow it to}} slide as temperature changes occur. But experience has shown that expansion joints often leak, leading to deterioration of underlying structural elements, and are expensive to maintain and replace. As a result integral abutments, which are fully fixed with respect to the bridge deck, are increasingly being recommended. However, there is uncertainty about the magnitude of the earth pressures that they should be required to support. Available evidence from model tests and from field instrumentation does not provide a basis upon which to predict either the circumstances under which thermal cycling will lead to significant increases in earth pressure, or the levels to which they might rise. This paper reports the result of laboratory tests on natural clay samples, on pluviated sand specimens, and on glass <b>ballotini,</b> all of which have been subjected to the stress paths and levels of cyclic straining that a typical integral bridge abutment might impose on its retained soil. The results show that whereas the natural clay and the glass <b>ballotini</b> showed no lateral stress accumulation, regardless of strain levels and stress excursions, the pluviated sand specimens experienced systematic increases in lateral stress for almost all cyclic strain levels, eventually reaching states of stress at, or close to, both active and passive. The underlying mechanisms of stress increase are explored, and it is concluded that particle shape {{is an important factor in}} determining the response of soil to this special type of loadin...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{strength}} of liquid-bound granular pellets {{was measured by}} uniaxial compression at speeds of up to 150 mm/s. Pellets were made {{with a range of}} different powders: three fractions of spherical glass <b>ballotini</b> from 26 to 78 mu m in size, copper powders of spherical, irregular and dendritic morphology, and also a crushed silica powder. A silicone oil with nominal viscosity of 1 Pa s was used as binder in the majority of the work. The results for the three different sized <b>ballotini</b> all collapsed together onto a single curve when plotted as a dimensionless peak flow stress versus the capillary number. As found previously [22] [S. M. Iveson, J. Beathe, N. W. Page, The dynamic {{strength of}} partially saturated powder compacts: the effects of liquid properties, Powder Technol. 127 (2002) 149 - 161], there were two distinct regions of behaviour. At low capillary numbers where viscous forces were insignificant, the flow stress was independent of strain rate (Region 1), whereas at high strain rates where viscous forces dominate, the flow stress increased proportional to capillary number to the power of approximately 0. 5 (Region II). The flow stresses of the non-spherical powders were higher than for the spherical powders, however, the trends were identical. There was also the same transition from brittle to plastic behaviour as observed and modeled previously for spherical particles [23] [S. M. Iveson, N. W.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{coalescence}} of secondary dispersions in beds of monosized glass <b>ballotini.</b> The variables investigated were superficial velocity, bed depth, <b>ballotini</b> size and dispersed phase concentration. Equipment was designed to generate a toluene ln water dispersion with phase ratios from 0. 1 - 1. 0 v/v % and whose mean drop size was determined using a Coulter Counter. The coalesced drops were sized by photography and the mean diameter of the effluent drops was determined using a Malvern Particle Size Analyser. Previous models describing single phase flow in porous media are reviewed and {{it was found that the}} experimental data obtained in this study is best represented by the Carman-Kozeny equations. Relative permeability correlations were used to predict the saturation profiles across the bed from measured two phase pressure drop data. Theoretical comparison of drop capture mechanisms indicated that direct and indirect interception are predominant. The total capture efficiency for the bed can also be evaluated using Spielman and Fitzpatrick's correlation. The resulting equation is used to predict the initial, local drop capture rate in a coalescer. A mathematical description of the saturation profiles is formulated and verified by the saturation profiles obtained by relative permeability. Based on the Carman-Kozeny equation, an expression is derived analytically to. predict the two phase pressure drop using the parameters which characterise the saturation profiles. By specifying the local saturation at the inlet face for a given velocity and phase ratio, good agreement between experimental pressure drop data and the model predictions was obtained.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Leaks {{in water}} {{distribution}} mains {{are a major}} issue throughout the world. The amount of water lost through these leaks is unacceptable for a resource, which is becoming ever scarcer. Little {{is known about the}} fundamentals, which exist outside leaking water distribution mains. The se fundamentals are the interaction between the leaking water and the soil surrounding the distribution main. This interaction is known as the leak - soil interaction. Research has found that a phenomenon called internal fluidisation typically occurs in the soils outside of leaks in distribution mains. Internal fluidisation is a complex interaction between the leak and the surrounding soil, whereby the soil losses its intermolecular bonding and becomes displaced by the water jet generated by the leak. It is believed that this complex phenomenon causes large energy losses. Subsequently, many water leaks are not able to propagate to the ground surface where they will be visible. This leads to many such leaks being undetected below the ground surface. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop an experimental setup, which simulated the internal fluidisation phenomenon. The setup consisted primarily of an orifice, simulating a leak in a distribution pipe; surrounded by <b>ballotini</b> (glass beads), as the soil medium surrounding the pipe; and the measurement instruments, which were Pitot tubes. When using the experimental setup, pore pressures and dynamic pressures around the leak and therefore within the <b>ballotini</b> bed were measured using two Pitot tubes. The accuracy and repeatability of these measurements were also of importance and were investigated. The accuracy of the measurements were dependant on the precision of the Pitot tubes in taking measurements. They were found to have an error of up to 4. 1 %, although the experiment to test for the accuracy was not fool proof. The repeatability of the measurements was found to have a 3. 8 % average difference between the previous and repeated measurements. The measuring of the pore pressures and dynamic pressures resulted in the following findings, which were the most important in the study: There were large vertical velocities found in the fluidized zone, where outside of this zone they were significantly smaller. The largest pore pressure was found to occur near the top of the fluidised zone. The pore pressures in the bed from a certain distance away from the orifice had a linear distribution, illustrating that Darcy water flow was present. High energy existed in the fluidised zone where it was greatest nearest the orifice and decreased to the top of the fluidised zone. In the <b>ballotini</b> bed outside of the fluidised zone the energy was found to be considerably smaller and decreased further away from the orifice...|$|E

Increased platelet adhesiveness has been shown to occur in patients with ischaemic heart disease (MacDonald and Edgill, 1957). The close association of diabetes with an increased susceptibility to arterial disease suggested that changes in platelet stickiness might also occur in this disorder. Bridges, Dalby, Millar, and Weaver (1965) in a study of 22 diabetics found a significant increase in platelet adhesiveness to glass and also increased adhesiveness after adminis-tration of glucose in both healthy and diabetic persons.

40|$|Measurements are {{reported}} of the attenuation, CI, and the velocity, c, of l- 5 MHz compressional wave ultrasound in suspensions of glass <b>ballotini</b> in Newtonian and non-Newtonian base fluids. For the Newtonian fluids, good agreement is {{found between the}} measured a and c, and the c (and c obtained from the Urick and the Ament expressions, using the same value for the base fluid’s viscosity. For the non-Newtonian base fluids, this agreement was absent. The existence of shear elasticity G in these fluids is suggested to explain the results. By incorporating elasticity into the Urick and the Ament theories the disagreement is resolved, and values of G are found which are in order-of-magnitude agreement with those found at the same frequency by another method. A test is proposed of a recent assertion that simple molecular fluids possess a shear elasticity...|$|E

40|$|This work reports {{experimental}} {{results on the}} heat transfer between a fluidised bed of fine particles and a submerged surface. Experiments {{have been carried out}} using different bed materials (polymers, <b>ballotini,</b> corundum, carborundum and quartz sand) with Archimedes number between 2 and 50. Dry air at ambient pressure and temperature has been used as fluidising gas. Three different exchange surfaces, namely a sphere and two cylinders with different base diameter and same height, have been used. Experimental results show that the heat transfer coefficient increases with particle Archimedes number and is almost independent from particle thermal conductivity for Kp/Kg > 30. Finally, the comparison of heat transfer coefficient for the different surfaces shows that the effect of the surface geometry may account for a 30 % variation in the heat transfer coefficient, with higher differences occurring for coarser particles...|$|E

Glass <b>Ballotini</b> bits at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 wt/wt were be suspended in water and compressed air at 1, 3 and 5 mm/s superficial gas velocities were used. Plots of pressure versus impeller speed indicates that near the just-suspension speed, the base pressure values show a tendency to either decrease or remain constant after increasing with speed at lower impeller speeds. It was also observed that at the last point of suspension, i. e. {{at the center of}} the tank for 6 DT, a marked reduction in pressure values occurs after the particles were all suspended, indicating that the tank bottom pressure could be used as an objective means of determining the just-suspension speed...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a modified Abbe refractometer {{for measuring the}} optical transmittance across a plane interface from a diffusely scattering turbid sample into a prism. When the prism refractive index exceeds that of the sample, a critical angle is present even when the sample contains particles which are wavelength sized or larger. Hence, the sample refractive index may be measured. However, measurements of transmittance near the critical angle show a poor definition of the critical angle for some samples, with a consequent loss of experimental precision in the refractive index. The method is applied to several polymer latex dispersions and some glass <b>ballotini.</b> For all lattices the measured refractive index varies linearly with latex volume fraction. For all dispersions except one the dependence of refractive index on volume fraction is in good agreement with the theory of refractive index based on Mie scattering by spherical particles...|$|E
40|$|The runback ice {{phenomenon}} is well-known for anti-icing or de-icing systems {{when the system}} is not evaporating 100 % of the water impinging the surface. The water runs back {{to the point where the}} added heat no longer raises the surface temperature above freezing. The water freezes behind this limit. No runback ice is tolerated for some flight configurations, but not for all. Then for o. -design cases, some runback ice may grow on the wings surface. However, data from full-scale realistic runback ice is not very well-known by aircraft manufacturers and they are not sure what thickness is allowed before the e. ect of the ice on the flow becomes too adverse. To better understand full-scale high-fidelity runback ice growth and how it can be simulated with simplistic shapes, test campaigns and CFD studies were undertaken. First of all, tests in the Cranfield icing tunnel were performed. In this work, full-scale runback ice shapes were grown on a model with a full-scale leading edge equiped with an electrical heating system. An innovative moulding and casting technique has been introduced which allowed the production of 3 D planarised full-scale realistic runback ice castings. In parallel to the icing tunnel tests, a mass and energy balance has been computed on Excel. This energy and mass balance can predict the heat and mass fluxes involved in the runback ice accretion mechanism. Following this, aerodynamic tests of the ice castings were lead in one of the low speed wind tunnels at Cranfield University. The aerodynamics of simplistic shapes such as geometrical shapes or <b>ballotini</b> layers were also studied. The e. ects of the ice castings on the flow were compared to the e. ects of the simplistic shapes. The tests were done on a flat surface and not on an airfoil due to technical complications. The boundary layer displacement thickness was the parameter used to quantify the e. ect of the shapes on the flow. 2 D CFD simulations were performed as a support to the testing but as well to compare with the experimental data. The CFD simulations were for steady or unsteady flow. It has been possible to grow full-scale ice shapes in a relatively small icing tunnel. The shapes have been successfuly moulded and cast using silicone and plaster mixed with polymer. A catalogue of runback ice shapes for different liquid water content, heat inputs and positions along the chord has been recorded. Following the wind tunnel tests, it has been possible to find a relationship between the real ice and the simplistic shapes. Thin runback ice shapes (4 mm) has a similar e. ect on the flow as a layer of 1 mm <b>ballotini.</b> It was found that thicker ice shapes, of the order of 1 cm, is equivalent to a rectangle with rounded corner, associated with 1 mm <b>ballotini.</b> The triangle shape which is usually used to simulate runback ice by the aircraft manufacturers, was found to be the most aerodynamically penalising simplisitc shape that has been investigated in this PhD project. It was found that rounded corners greatly improve the representativeness of the simplistic shapes, such as triangle or rectangle. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} of membrane processes {{there is a need}} to understand the basic phenomena occurring at the membrane and in the bulk fluid. Fluid dynamic gauging (FDG) is a technique that has been used previously to measure the thickness and strength characteristics of a fouling layer on solid surfaces. Here, its application has been extended to investigate the nature of fouling deposition on membranes in dead-end and cross-flow microfiltration. Two modes of FDG measurement are demonstrated, wherein either (i) the mass flow rate of liquid withdrawn through the gauge or (ii) the pressure drop across the nozzle, are fixed. In dead-end filtration, the deposition of <b>ballotini</b> on a polymeric membrane is monitored quantitatively via measurements of thickness and the permeate flux. FDG has also been integrated with imaging techniques to study the deposition and removal processes. In cross-flow, FDG proved to be able to monitor the growth of fouling layers during molasses processing...|$|E

Experiments {{have been carried out}} using different bed materials (polymers, <b>ballotini,</b> corundum, carborundum and quartz sand) characterized by a mean particle diameters ranging between 30 and 90 µm and an Archimedes number between 2 and 50. Dry air at 25 °C and 100 kPa has been used as fluidising gas. Three different objects are used as heat transfer probes: a sphere and two cylinders with different base diameter and same height. Experimental results show that the heat transfer coefficient increases with particle Archimedes number and is almost independent from particle thermal conductivity for a Kp between 0. 9 and 16 W/(m•K). Finally, the comparison of heat transfer coefficient for the different probes shows that the effect of the surface geometry may account for a 30 % variation in the heat transfer coefficient, with higher differences occurring for coarser particles...|$|E
