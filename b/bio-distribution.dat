50|$|A {{multitude}} of exogenous contrast agents have been developed, or are under development, for optoacoustics. These contrast agents {{should have an}} absorption spectrum {{different from that of}} endogenous tissue absorbers, {{so that they can be}} separated from other background absorbers using spectral unmixing. Different classes of exogenous contrast agents exist.Organic dyes, such as the fluorochromes indocyanine green and methylene blue, are non-specific, approved for clinical use, and suitable for perfusion imaging. They typically have low quantum yield, so they convert a large portion of absorbed energy into heat and thus photoechoes. Since these dyes can be imaged based on optoacoustics and fluorescence, the two types of microscopies can be used to complement and verify each other. In fact, organic dyes are generally well characterized because of their widespread use in fluorescence imaging. Photosensitizers, already in clinical use for photodynamic therapy, can be detected using MSOT, allowing analysis of their pharmacokinetics and <b>bio-distribution</b> in vivo. Light-absorbing nanoparticles offer potential advantages over organic dyes because of their ability to produce stronger photoechoes and their lower photosensitivity. One disadvantage is that they must be approved individually for human use because their safety has not been well established. Gold nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and iron-oxide particles have been used for optoacoustic imaging in animals. Gold nanoparticles generate strong optoacoustic signals due to plasmon resonance, and their absorption spectrum can be tuned by modifying their shape. Some iron oxide nanoparticles, such as SPIO, have already been approved for the clinic as MRI contrast agents.|$|E

Location of these tumors within {{the central nervous}} system (CNS), which is considered a "privileged" organ, can prevent the penetration of chemotherapeutic agents through the blood–brain barrier (BBB). To overcome this limitation, nanoparticles are taken up and transported by macrophage and then delivered directly into the CNS. In this study, we used macrophage to uptake the folate-targeted bifunctional micelles loaded with near-infrared (NIR) dye ICG-Der- 01 and investigate the dynamic <b>bio-distributions</b> of macrophage after intravenous injection into tumor-bearing mice. In vitro cellular experiments by confocal microscopy indicated that the uptake of micelles in macrophage was greatly enhanced due to the folate receptor overexpression.

30|$|As for in vivo studies, the {{administration}} routes {{play an important}} part on neurotoxicity of NPs [111, 112]. The Ti contents in the brain regions of mice/rats could not be detected when the TiO 2 NPs were administrated via intravenous injection [73 – 75, 113]. But when the pregnant mice were treated with TiO 2 NPs, their uterine weights were lowered with smaller fetuses, which indirectly suggested that the TiO 2 NPs could induce fetal resorption and retard fetal growth via intravenous injection [67]. Ti could not be detected in the brain when mice were exposed to TiO 2 NPs by inhalation [114]. Based on current studies, the intranasal instillation or nasal administration was the most effective pathway for TiO 2 NPs to be translocated into the brain [16]. This {{might be due to}} the retrograde axonal translocation of NPs directly from the nose to the brain. Therefore, more researches are needed to investigate how and why the different administration routes lead to different NP <b>bio-distributions.</b>|$|R

Selective antigen-mimicking anti-idiotype antibody facilitates the assessment of therapeutic antibody in the detection, quantitation and characterization of antibody immune responses. Using mouse specific degenerate primer pairs and splenocytic RNA, we generated an idiotype antibody-immunized phage-displayed scFv library in which an anti-idiotype antibody against the therapeutic chimera anti-CD 22 antibody SM 03 was isolated. The anti-idiotype scFv recognized the idiotype of anti-CD 22 antibody and inhibited binding of SM 03 to CD 22 on Raji cell surface. The anti-idiotype scFv was subsequently classified as Ab 2 c type. Moreover, our results also demonstrated firstly that the anti-idiotype scFv {{could be used for}} pharmacokinetic measurement of circulating residual antibody in lymphoma patients treated with chimera anti-CD 22 monoclonal antibody SM 03.

5000|$|Squalamine is an amphipathic {{zwitterionic}} molecule. At physiological pH it {{is positively}} charged. Because of the stereochemistry of its steroid framework, it assumes a flat, plate-like structure. As {{a consequence of}} these physical properties, squalamine binds electrostatically to membranes made of negatively charged phospholipids(PLs). The orientation of the polar substituents on squalamine causes it {{to sit on the}} surface of the membrane to which it binds, rather than penetrate the surface. Bacteria, unlike most eukaryotic cells, display negatively charged PLs on the membrane surfaces that are exposed to the environment. Squalamine, like many of the cationic antimicrobial peptides and proteins that have been discovered to date, interacts with the plasma membranes of bacteria and disturb function; precisely how squalamine's membrane attack kills its microbial targets remains unknown. Eukaryotic cells position negatively charged PLs on the inner leaflet (the cytoplasmic face)of the plasma membrane;the outer leaflet, the surface exposed to the outside world, is populated principally by zwitterionic PLs, such as phosphatidyl choline. Why such asymmetry in the anionic phospholipid composition of the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane exists is not known. Squalamine does not normally interact with the plasma membranes of normal eukaryotic cells because of the absence of negatively charged PLs on their surface. However, certain cells possess specific [...] "transporters" [...] that provide squalamine with an access through the membrane. Liver, capillary, and certain hematopoetic cells possess these transporters and define the pharmacology of the compound, restricting its <b>bio-distribution</b> to a limited numbers of tissues and organs in an animal. Once squalamine has traversed the plasma membrane, it binds electrostatically to the negatively charged cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane, effectively neutralizing the negative surface potential. As a consequence, proteins that are bound to that surface through electrostatic interactions are displaced. The cellular consequences of this [...] "displacement" [...] will vary depending upon the specific cellular context. Since proteins such as the Rho GTPases, which play a role in actin dynamics and cellular movement, are linked to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane, squalamine disrupts several Rac1-actin-dependent processes, such as growth factor dependent endothelial migration and angiogenesis.|$|E

30|$|To assess PET viability, it is {{important}} to have a clear read on two specific parameters regarding the biological target: the maximum concentration of target binding sites (Bmax) and brain <b>bio-distribution.</b> Bmax represents target expression level and is key to inform the level of affinity (Kd) required for a successful radiotracer (Bmax/Kd[*]≥[*] 10) (Patel & Gibson 2008). The lower the expression level, the higher the affinity required for a radiotracer to show in vivo specific binding. If a given target has a Bmax value less than 1 nM, it will be challenging to identify PET ligand leads with sufficient potency and alignment of other properties (e.g. PK, NSB). Early determination of Bmax would thus allow teams to assess the likelihood of success of PET strategy for various targets and help allocate resources to more viable targets (e.g. Bmax[*]>[*] 1 nM). Brain <b>bio-distribution,</b> while not impacting PET doability, is required to inform subsequent PET imaging studies such as specific binding assessment. For example, if a target is only expressed or enriched in certain brain regions [e.g. striatum for phosphodiesterase 10 (PDE 10) (Tu et al. 2010)] then a target-free brain region could be used as a “reference region” (e.g. cerebellum for PDE 10) to determine specific binding. On the other hand, if a target is expressed throughout the brain [e.g. PDE 4, (Pérez-Torres et al. 2000) metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR 5) (Romano et al. 1995)], it would be necessary to carry out both baseline and blocking or equivalent (e.g. knock-out animal) studies to determine specific binding. For any novel CNS target that lacks pre-existing knowledge on Bmax and <b>bio-distribution,</b> we took an approach to quickly identify a suitable [3 H] or [125 I] radiotracer to enable saturation binding and in vitro autoradiography studies for Bmax and <b>bio-distribution</b> determination. Unlike PET ligands, a [3 H] or [125 I] radiotracer is not necessarily required to be brain permeable as the studies are carried out in vitro, hence taking much less effort to develop a suitable ligand. Furthermore, a [3 H] or [125 I] radiotracer can be used to establish binding assays early on to identify leads with potent binding affinity for PET consideration. Taken together, a small upfront effort in identifying a target-specific [3 H] or [125 I] radiotracer could lead to significant time and cost saving down the road and could be considered as pre-requisite to initiating any extensive PET discovery effort for a novel CNS target.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: (188) Rhenium-HEDP is an {{effective}} bone-targeting therapeutic radiopharmaceutical, for treatment of osteoblastic bone metastases. It is known {{that the presence of}} carrier (non-radioactive rhenium as ammonium perrhenate) in the reaction mixture during labeling is a prerequisite for adequate bone affinity, but {{little is known about the}} optimal carrier concentration. METHODS: We investigated the influence of carrier concentration in the formulation on the radiochemical purity, in-vitro hydroxyapatite affinity and the in-vivo bone accumulation of (188) Rhenium-HEDP in mice. RESULTS: The carrier concentration influenced hydroxyapatite binding in-vitro as well as bone accumulation in-vivo. Variation in hydroxyapatite binding with various carrier concentrations seemed to be mainly driven by variation in radiochemical purity. The in-vivo bone accumulation appeared to be more complex: satisfactory radiochemical purity and hydroxyapatite affinity did not necessarily predict acceptable <b>bio-distribution</b> of (188) Rhenium-HEDP. CONCLUSIONS: For development of new bisphosphonate-based radiopharmaceuticals for clinical use, human administration should not be performed without previous animal <b>bio-distribution</b> experiments. Furthermore, our clinical formulation of (188) Rhenium-HEDP, containing 10 mumol carrier, showed excellent bone accumulation that was comparable to other bisphosphonate-based radiopharmaceuticals, with no apparent uptake in other organs.

RESULTS: The proliferation rate and radioactive emission of human PDB-MSCs after labeled with different concentrations of (14) C-TdR were measured. PDB-MSCs labeled with 1 μCi possessed high radioactivity, and the biological characteristics (i. e. morphology, colony forming ability, differentiation capabilities, karyotype and cell cycle) showed no significant changes after labeling. Thus, 1 μCi was the optimal concentration in this experimental design. In nude mice, 1 [*]×[*] 10 (6) (14) C-TdR-labeled PDB-MSCs were injected intravenously and the organs were collected at days 1, 2, 3, 5, 30 and 180 after injection, respectively. Radiolabeled PDB-MSCs were found mainly in the lung, liver, spleen, stomach and left femur of the recipient nude mice at the whole observation period. CONCLUSIONS: This work provided solid evidence that (14) C-TdR labeling did not alter the biological characteristics of human placental MSCs, and that this labeling method has potential to decrease the signal from non-infused or dead cells for cell tracking.

As no data has been reported on the theoretical differences between these three variants of radiolabeled choline, this study aims to explore the knowledge on the physiological distribution of these three tracers, to compare data of imaging acquisition protocols and to verify the theoretical equivalence in terms of diagnostic accuracy and potential false positive cases that can occur in clinical practice. A literature research about published papers was conducted regarding the physiological distribution, imaging acquisition protocols and diagnostic performance of 11 C-choline, 18 F-methylcholine and 18 F-ethylcholine PET/CT. Minimal differences of the "in vivo" <b>bio-distribution</b> of the variants of radiolabeled choline were registered. Several imaging acquisition protocols were utilized, considering the different half-decay of 11 C and 18 F and the early urinary excretion of 18 F-FECH. The diagnostic accuracy resulted similar for all the tracers, despite an insignificant amount of data for 18 F-FECH; however, some pitfalls were documented for all the variants, related to the intrinsic properties of choline as a non-tumour specific tracer. Finally, our clinical experience with the two fluorinated kinds of choline has also been reported describing the "in vivo" <b>bio-distribution</b> with semi-quantitative measurement of Standardised Uptake Value in target organs. The literature suggests these three variants of choline equally useful {{to be considered for}} prostate cancer imaging. A standardisation of acquisition protocols for fluorinated choline PET/CT has also been proposed...|$|E
40|$|A methotrexate-bisphosphonate {{conjugate}} {{containing a}} peptide bond {{has been found}} to possess over five times greater antineo-plastic activity against osteosarcoma in experimental animal models compared with methotrexate alone. Methods: The conjugate was labeled with MrTTc in the presence of stannous ions to determine biologic distribution, with special reference to osseous tissue. <b>Bio-distribution</b> studies were carried out in mice after intravenous ad ministration of the labeled conjugate. Radionuclide imaging of rab bits was also performed. Results: The labeled conjugate behaved like a bone-seeking agent. Conclusion: The present study indicates that the concept of treating osteosarcoma or metastatic tumors of bone with this class of agents has a firm basis.
