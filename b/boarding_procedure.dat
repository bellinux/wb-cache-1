50|$|In 2007, Southwest {{modified}} their <b>boarding</b> <b>procedure</b> {{by introducing}} a number. Each passenger receives a letter (A, B or C) {{and a number}} 1 through 60. Passengers line up in numerical order within each letter group and choose any open seat on the aircraft as part of Southwest's open seating policy. According to a 2012 study by Mythbusters, this is the fastest method currently in use for non-first class passengers to board a plane; on average, it is 10 minutes faster than the standard method used by most airlines of boarding from the back frontward.|$|E

The only United States naval kite balloon pilot casualty was an unsuccessful attempted return to a destroyer escorting an eastbound convoy through the Irish Sea on the stormy evening of 14 August 1918. The rubber cow began alternately plunging port and starboard as the tether was shortened, dipping the pilot's basket into the water on each dive; and the basket was empty when the kite balloon stabilized on a short tether.|$|E

40|$|Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo {{optimization}} algorithm {{and a computer}} simulation, I find the passenger ordering which minimizes {{the time required to}} board the passengers onto an airplane. The model that I employ assumes that the time that a passenger requires to load his or her luggage is the dominant contribution to the time needed to completely fill the aircraft. The optimal boarding strategy may reduce the time required to board and airplane by over a factor of four and possibly more depending upon the dimensions of the aircraft. In addition, knowledge of the optimal <b>boarding</b> <b>procedure</b> can inform decisions regarding changes to methods that are employed by a particular carrier. I explore some of the salient features of the optimal boarding method and discuss practical modifications to the optimal. Finally, I mention some of the benefits that could come from implementing an improved passenger boarding scheme. Comment: Accepted for publication in the Journal of Air Transport Management.

40|$|Aircraft {{boarding}} {{is always}} on the critical path of the turnaround. Efficient <b>boarding</b> <b>procedures</b> have to consider both operational constraints and the individual passenger behaviour. In contrast to the handling processes of fuelling, catering and cleaning, the boarding process is mainly driven by the passenger and not by airport or airline employees. Models for evaluating boarding sequences mainly depend more on assumptions concerning the individual passenger processes in the aircraft than on reliable field measurements. This paper provides a set of operational data including classification of boarding times, passenger arrival times, time to store hand luggage, and passenger interactions as a fundamental basis for the calibration of boarding simulation models. In this paper, a microscopic approach is used to model the passenger behaviour, where the passenger movement is defined as a one-dimensional, stochastic, and time/space discrete transition process. This model is used to compare measurements from field trials of <b>boarding</b> <b>procedures</b> with simulation results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study how {{different}} <b>boarding</b> <b>procedures</b> on buses affect bus bunching, passenger travel time and waiting time, taking the effects on the whole transit network in mind. To achieve this {{it is important to}} be able to quantify the bunching problems in situations with different <b>boarding</b> <b>procedures</b> and demand. Video recording of bus boarding and alighting in Stockholm and Gothenburg was used to calibrate and validate dwell time models. Identification of suitable dwell time functions was based on the data and former experience. The network performance analysis is based on simulation of two bus lines with different supply and demand running partially parallel. The simulation shows that in a system with many passengers and overlapping bus lines, free boarding through all doors can decrease average passenger travel time and vehicle circulation time by 20 - 25 per cent during rush hour. At the same time better regularity means less crowded buses, and for each bus and stop 0. 5 passengers less were left behind due to overcrowding. Allowing the passengers to board through all doors can in combination with a good holding strategy give large benefits in a transit network in the size of Stockholm. Even though bus bunching is a well-known phenomenon, it is seldom considered when evaluating new transit policies and this can lead to underestimation of the effects...|$|R
