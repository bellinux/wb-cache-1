40|$|Butacene® (trademark by SNPE, France) with ferrocenyl groups {{chemically}} {{bonded to}} HTPB backbone leads to high burning rates (rb > 20 mm/s at 7 MPa) in AP-Al based solid composite rocket propellant (SCRP) formulations {{by keeping the}} pressure exponent (n) lower than 0. 5. Moreover, one can pre-serve the characteristics (kneading process, mechanical properties, pot-life) of conventional HTPB binder formulations together with less sensitivity regarding formation of pyrophoric iron on inner surfaces of the propellant grain. The behavior of <b>Butacene</b> formulations during accelerated aging is analyzed mainly by DMA and additional results are shared with the current study. The thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA) is used to characterize SCRP for thermal expansion. But TMA {{can be used in}} part complementary to DMA as it is also sensitive to molecular mobility of the different fractions in highly filled elastomeric network. <b>Butacene</b> preserved insensitivity compared to a formulation with HTPB and using other materials as burning catalyst as CatoceneTM or iron oxide. The interpretation of SCRP cure kinetics is important {{in order to get the}} final product free of flaws, i. e., cracks, fissures, voids, and further on interphases with adequate mechanical properties. An important point is to be able to define final point of curing and residual post-curing time because the latter interferes with the accelerated aging and would distort the estimation of in-service time. Thus analysis of rheological and thermal cure kinetics during the evolution of liquid to gel to solid phase is investigated. The curing characteristics of such a system can be modelled in several ways in terms of viscosity build-up w. r. t. time, thermally with DSC via Kissinger method, and in Heat Flow Calorimeter (HFC) and Pressure Curing Cells (PCC). Current work comprise cure modelling in PCC with different SCRP formulations, which allows the investigation of the effect of curing catalyst TPB (triphenyl bismuth), reactivity of formulations containing HTPB and Butacene® versus the formulation based on HTPB binder alone...|$|E
40|$|Butacene® binder, ferrocenyl groups {{chemically}} {{bonded to}} HTPB backbone, leads to high burn rates BR for Al-AP based composite propellants (BR > 20 mm/s at 7 MPa), and low pressure exponents (n < 0. 5) which gives more flexibility to the rocket designer. The key molecular level characteristic of such elastomeric binder systems of composite rocket propellants is the glass-to-rubber transition region, which is mainly {{defined by the}} molecular mobility of the components in the polymeric network during the transition from energy to entropy elasticity with respect to temperature. Analyzing molecular rearrangement regions or binder mobility fractions related to the glass-rubber transition of such composite propellants during storage is {{important in terms of}} in inservice time estimations. This feature has a strong dependence on temperature and is detectable by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) whereby obtaining the loss factor (tanδ= loss module / storage module) curves. Butacene® and HTPB based binders alone and two propellant formulations (HTPB/Butacene®/AP(bi-modal) /Al) were prepared and analyzed unsing the loss factor curves obtained by torsion DMA. A special modelling with so-named EMG (exponentionally modified Gauss) distributions was used to define and quantify sub-transition regions in the loss factor curve. For comparison with <b>Butacene</b> based propellants, also a HTPB/AP/Al composite propellant formulation was produced and analysed...|$|E
40|$|Two {{series of}} {{chemically}} well-defined polyurethanes (PUs) have been synthesized containing two different soft segments {{of interest in}} aerospace applications. At a given soft fragment, four different hard segments (HSs) based on single diisocyanate molecules with no chain extenders have been incorporated. Both segmented PU series have been prepared by stoichiometric reactions of the macrodiol hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), and a metallo-derived, this being the (ferrocenylbutyl) dimethylsilane grafted on HTPB, so-called <b>Butacene.</b> Those HSs are isophorone diisocyanate, toluene- 2, 4 -diisocyanate, 4, 4 ′-diphenyl methane diisocyanate, and hexamethylene diisocyanate. Microphase separation and morphology development have been studied at room temperature in these copolymers using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, analyzing {{the change in the}} relative intensities of free and hydrogen-bonded carbonyl peaks. Measurements of wide- and small-angle X-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation allow analyzing the morphological and microstructural differences between these two series of samples. In addition, dynamic mechanical analysis and differential scanning calorimetry have been used to learn about the relaxation processes and thermal transitions that are observed in these materials and to confirm the existence or lack of phase segregation. The knowledge of structure-property relationship is very important in these advanced organometallic PUs to get an understanding of their application as solid composite propellants binder.
