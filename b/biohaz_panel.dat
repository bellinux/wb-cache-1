40|$|Following {{a request}} from the Spanish Competent Authority, the EFSA Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) was asked to deliver a Scientific Opinion on the {{biological}} safety of a specific process for the Hydrolysis on-Farm of Dead Pigs. The application concerns the on-farm treatment of pig carcasses and other pig by-products 2, which are considered as Category 2 animal by-products according to Reg. (EC) No 1774 / 2002, through an enzymatic hydrolysis in mesophilic and partially anaerobic conditions within a closed vat {{for a period of}} minimum six months. The intended end-use of the processed material is represented by its utilisation as organic fertilizer or soil improver, as composting material, as biogas production material or as a material to be delivered to a waste management unit for disposal. The <b>BIOHAZ</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that, due to some deficiencies in the provided dossier, {{it was not possible to}} assess the safety of the process for the disposal or use of Category 2 animal by-products. The <b>BIOHAZ</b> <b>Panel</b> does not recommend this process to be applied as an alternative method of disposal or use of Category 2 animal by-products...|$|E

The paper ‘Evidence for zoonotic potential of ovine scrapie prions ’ by Cassard et al. (2014) is scientifically appraised, focussing on the experimental design, the results and the conclusions. The paper provides evidence in a laboratory experiment that some Classical scrapie isolates can propagate in humanised transgenic mice and produce prions that on second passage are similar to those causing one form of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). It is concluded that the results from the study raise the possibility that scrapie prions have the potential to be zoonotic, but do not provide evidence that transmission can or does take place under field conditions.

40|$|Following {{a request}} from EFSA, the Panel on Biological Hazards was asked to (i) {{identify}} the serotypes of Yersinia enterocolitica which are pathogenic to humans, (ii) give advice regarding the analytical methods {{to be used to}} detect and identify the human pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica serotypes from food and animals, (iii) consider the need to monitor Yersinia pseudotuberculosis in animals and food and (iv) recommend the monitoring methods for Yersinia spp. in animal populations and foodstuffs that are most optimal from the public health point of view. There are several species of the genus Yersinia. Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis are widespread in Europe and have the characteristics of typical enteropathogens. Not all Yersinia enterocolitica strains are pathogenic. The <b>BIOHAZ</b> <b>Panel</b> concludes that the best and most reliable indicator of Y. enterocolitica pathogenicity is the biotype as the various biotypes are either pathogenic or non-pathogenic. The serotype is not a reliable marker of Y. enterocolitica pathogenicity because several serotypes are common to both pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. Strains of biotype 4 (serotype O: 3) and biotype 2 (serotypes O: 9) are commonly associated with human infections in Europe. Biotype 4 predominates in mos...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission (EC), the Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on the Risk for Human and Animal Health related to the revision of the BSE Monitoring regime in some Member States. The <b>BIOHAZ</b> <b>Panel</b> was invited to provide an assessment {{on the existence of}} a significant additional risk, if any, to human and animal health, compared with the situation at the time following the implementation of a revised BSE monitoring regime in the old 15 European Member States (EU 15) 2. The Panel was asked to consider age options between 30 and 60 months (with 6 months intervals) for BSE testing of healthy slaughtered cattle and between 24 months to 60 months (with 6 months intervals) for testing of at risk cattle in EU 15 and compare the different scenarios. It was then clarified with the EC that the mandate was focused on the assessment of possible differences between the BSE surveillance system at the time and the proposed review in terms of efficiency to monitor the epidemiological situation in the cattle population. Moreover, the term “significant ” inserted in the terms of reference of the mandate was not to be considered in its statistical meaning...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on genetic TSE resistance in goats in consideration of a pilot project study carried out in Cyprus. In particular, the <b>BIOHAZ</b> <b>Panel</b> was requested to assess the scientific validity {{of the study and}} to indicate to what extent and based on this study genetic breeding {{can be used as a}} control program for Classical scrapie in goats in Cyprus. The review of the limited studies carried out so far indicate that PRNP polymorphisms can modulate scrapie susceptibility in goats. Some polymorphisms could be associated with a lower susceptibility to TSE and are possible candidates for future breeding programmes. It has to be clarified whether the association of PRNP polymorphisms with apparent resistance to scrapie in goat is limited to those scrapie agents involved in the outbreaks studied and if this apparent resistance can be extended to other combinations of TSE agents/goat breeds. The report of the Cypriot pilot study presents a case control study in Cypriot goat herds aiming at the identification of the effect of PRNP polymorphisms on TSE susceptibility. According to the author, the results obtained would indicate a higher resistance agains...|$|E
40|$|Currently, 12 rapid BSE {{test kits}} are {{approved}} by the EC for the routine post mortem testing of slaughtered cattle over 30 months of age {{in accordance with the}} TSE Regulation (EC) No 999 / 2001. The EC is considering launching a new open call for expression of interest for rapid tests for use in the framework of TSE monitoring. Therefore, the EFSA was requested to update the current protocols for the laboratory evaluation and field trial, taking into account experience gained in past evaluation rounds. The experts of the <b>BIOHAZ</b> <b>panel</b> conclude that the revised evaluation protocol takes into account, experience gained in previous evaluation rounds, knowledge accumulated in recent years with the active surveillance program, constraints such as practicability and potential availability of biological material. This protocol ensures that newly approved tests will not be inferior to previously approved BSE post mortem screening tests. The criteria in this revised protocol introduce more comprehensive and higher standards than have previously been approved for validation of cattle post mortem BSE tests which will allow a more comprehensive evaluation of the test’s performance (analytical sensitivity). Since the last rapid test evaluation two new forms of TSE in cattle have been reported in different E...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission {{requested}} EFSA {{to review}} the former EFSA/BIOHAZ opinion on microbiological risks in infant formulae and follow-on formulae. Particularly it was requested to provide a scientific opinion on the possible correlation between Enterobacteriaceae and Enterobacter sakazakii and Enterobacteriaceae and Salmonella in infant formulae {{as well as on}} the correlation between Enterobacteriaceae and Salmonella in follow-on formulae, in the light of new scientific data. The usefulness of Enterobacteriaceae as indicators for E. sakazakiiand Salmonella in powdered infant formulae and follow-on formulae was also requested if available scientific data do not indicate a clear correlation. The products of concern are powdered infant formulae and powdered follow-on formulae. Consideration of microbiological criteria is outside of the remit of this opinion. Enterobacter sakazakii and Salmonella, both in the family Enterobacteriaceae, are hazards that are occasionally present in powdered infant formulae and powdered follow-on formulae. Given that Salmonella and E. sakazakii are both members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, there is some relationship between the presence of E. sakazakii and Salmonella and the presence of Enterobacteriaceae. If E. sakazakii or Salmonella are present, Enterobacteriaceae should be found provided that the methods are equally sensitive. In some instances levels are so low that if E. sakazakii or Salmonella is detected, Enterobacteriaceae are not detected, just due to “chance”. However, the reverse is not inevitably true since the presence of Enterobacteriaceae does not necessarily mean the presence of Salmonella or E. sakazakii. Industry data from different companies showed that E. sakazakii / Enterobacteriaceae ratios range from 9 to 30 %. A correlation between the prevalences of Enterobacteriaceae and that of E. sakazakii was observed in one plant but sufficient specific information was not available for the other plants. A correlation might be apparent according to the ecology of industrial units, with each unit having a characteristic ratio. The <b>BIOHAZ</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that there is a relationship between the presence of Enterobacteriaceae and E. sakazakii in powdered infant formulae. No universal correlation can be established. There are indications that correlations could be established at individual plant level. It is not possible to establish a correlation between Enterobacteriaceae and Salmonella in infant formulae and in follow-on formulae and, because Salmonella is so rarely present, suitable data are not available. Industrial experience indicates that monitoring Enterobacteriaceae in the processing environment and in the product can be used to confirm the application of GMP/GHP and HACCP and would be expected to reduce the prevalence of E. sakazakii. The <b>BIOHAZ</b> <b>Panel</b> recommended that documented data ideally using standardized methods be accumulated (by industry, regulators, academia) testing for Enterobacteriaceae, Salmonella, and E. sakazakii in the same samples (ingredients, end-product and environmental) across the industry to explore correlations and their relevance in setting control measure...|$|E
40|$|European Commission {{regulation}} 2073 / 2005 on the {{microbiological criteria}} for food requires that Escherichia coli is monitored {{as an indicator}} of hygienic conditions. Since verocytotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC) strains often cause food-borne infections by the consumption of raw food, the Biological Hazards (<b>BIOHAZ)</b> <b>panel</b> of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommended their monitoring in food as well. In particular, VTEC strains belonging to serogroups such as O 26, O 103, O 111, O 145, and O 157 are known causative agents of several human outbreaks. Eight real-time PCR methods for the detection of E. coli toxin genes and their variants (stx 1, stx 2), the intimin gene (eae), and five serogroup-specific genes have been proposed by the European Reference Laboratory for VTEC (EURL-VTEC) as a technical specification to the European Normalization Committee (CEN TC 275 /WG 6). Here we applied a “modular approach” to the in-house validation of these PCR methods. The modular approach subdivides an analytical process into separate parts called “modules,” which are independently validated based on method performance criteria for a limited set of critical parameters. For the VTEC real-time PCR module, the following parameters are being assessed: specificity, dynamic range, PCR efficiency, and limit of detection (LOD). This study describes the modular approach for the validation of PCR methods to be used in food microbiology, using single-target plasmids as positive controls and showing their applicability with food matrices.

40|$|EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) {{was asked}} for a {{scientific}} opinion on a novel process submitted by a European association as a safe means of disposal of Animal By-Products (ABP) according to Regulation (EC) 1774 / 20024. The application received describes a lime treatment process for dewatered pig and solid poultry manure which could be operated at two different temperatures (60 °C and 70 °C). The applicant carried out full scale trials for a batch process (i. e. stockpiles) utilizing quick lime (CaO) and demonstrated that the proposed process inactivated the relevant bacterial pathogens (Salmonella) and indicator (Enterococcus faecalis) by more than 5 log 10 and the relevant virus and parasite eggs by more than 3 log 10. The Panel concluded that the {{information provided by the}} applicant is sufficient to show that the mixing of dewatered pig and solid poultry manure with quicklime at the requested exposure time of 30 or 60 minutes, respectively for treatment at 70 °C and 60 °C at pH 12 meets the requirements for Agent Risk Reduction. However, it was highlighted that the assessment provided cannot be extended to different equipments, different types of manure and different incubation conditions than those used in the experimental validation. Moreover, the applicant did not give sufficient information to ascertain that in practice the target temperatures and pH are achieved in all part of the stockpile for the sufficient time period.

40|$|EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) {{was asked}} for a {{scientific}} opinion on an alternative method for processing Category (Cat) 2 Animal By-Products (ABP) as defined in Reg. (EC) 1069 / 20094. The material to be treated consists of dead-on-farm poultry; this implies that the animals died due to a disease, which in most cases was not properly diagnosed. The proposed method consists in a decomposition of the carcasses by a process of autolysis, putrefaction and finally digestion by insects that takes place on-farm in a proofed pit. The carcasses are taken daily from a warehouse and immediately thrown into the pit. Lime is added {{at the rate of}} 200 g/kg of carcass. Loading continues until the pit is full. The end-product obtained is intended to be used as an organic fertiliser. According to the legislation in force, before being used as an organic fertiliser, Cat. 2 material should be treated with a sterilisation process (i. e. 133 °C / 20 min / 3 bars / 50 mm particle size). The <b>BIOHAZ</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that the identification and characterisation of the risk material was not properly addressed in the application and a comprehensive list of possible hazards was not provided. No experimental validation with representative test-organisms under practical conditions was done. Because of a lack of information in the report, {{it was not possible to}} determine the degree of risk reduction of pathogenic bacterial, viral and parasitological agents achieved by the processes.

40|$|The TSE Infectivity Model (TSEi), {{developed}} for EFSA by a contractor, allows: i) {{the comparison of}} the level of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) infectivity in animal tissues; ii) the estimation of the impact of risk management options (removal of specified risk material) at single animal level and at animal population (country) level; and iii) the estimation of the impact of processing on the TSE infectivity level. TSEi was developed in Microsoft Excel {{with the use of the}} stochastic add-in Palisade @Risk version 6. 2. 1., and is supported by a user-friendly interface that allows for the input of the various data and parameters needed. Two interfaces are provided: BSE in cattle (validated) and scrapie in sheep (not validated, provided for demonstration purposes).

This list {{is intended to be}} considered for the annual updates and reviews of the Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) recommended list of biological agents. EFSA’s QPS assessment has entered EU law only recently with the publication of a new Commission Implementing Regulation No 562 / 2012 regarding specific data required for risk assessment of food enzymes having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1331 / 2008 establishing a common authorising procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings and to the EFSA guidance on data requirements for the evaluation of food enzyme applications. An EFSA internal working group (WG) prepared a list of microorganism species that maybe likely to be notified to EFSA in the near future based on available information relevant in the legal framework. A high number of application dossiers for risk assessment of enzymes are expected to be submitted until March 2015 in the context of enzyme safety evaluation to the FIP Unit and Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) Panel.

40|$|EFSA is {{requested}} {{to assess the}} safety of a broad range of biological agents in the context of notifications for market authorisation as sources of food and feed additives, enzymes and plant protection products. The qualified presumption of safety (QPS) assessment was developed for safety risk assessments to provide a harmonised generic pre-assessment to support EFSA’s scientific Panels. The safety of unambiguously defined biological agents at the highest taxonomic unit appropriate for the purpose for which an application is intended and the completeness of the body of knowledge are assessed. Identified safety concerns for a taxonomic unit are where possible and reasonable in number reflected as ‘qualifications’ with a recommendation for the QPS list. The list of QPS recommended biological agents is reviewed and updated annually. Therefore, the only valid list is the one in the most recently published scientific opinion. The 2012 update reviews microorganisms previously assessed including bacteria, yeasts, filamentous fungi and viruses used for plant protection purposes. The <b>BIOHAZ</b> <b>Panel</b> confirmed all taxonomic units previously recommended for the QPS list. The notifications were reviewed. Bacillus firmus was re-evaluated and not recommended for the QPS list. A new recommendation was made for Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides. Carnobacterium maltaromaticum was assessed {{for the first time and}} not recommended for the QPS list. Qualifications for the taxonomic units included in the QPS recommended list were reviewed and confirmed. Filamentous fungi and enterococci were not recommended for the QPS list following updating and reviewing of current scientific knowledge. For Enterococcus faecium recent data indicate a possible distinction between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. This is considered too recent knowledge for a QPS recommendation, considering the recent information on the evolution of the epidemiology of Enterococcus infections in humans...|$|E
