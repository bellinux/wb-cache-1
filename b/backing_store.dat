5|$|The SSEM {{had been}} {{designed}} by the team of Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill. To develop the Mark 1 {{they were joined by}} two research students, D.B.G.Edwards and G. E. Thomas; work began in earnest in August 1948. The project soon had the dual purpose of supplying Ferranti with a working design on which they could base a commercial machine, the Ferranti Mark 1, and of building a computer that would allow researchers to gain experience of how such a machine could be used in practice. The first of the two versions of the Manchester Mark 1– known as the Intermediary Version– was operational by April 1949. However, this first version lacked features such as the instructions necessary to programmatically transfer data between the main store and its newly developed magnetic <b>backing</b> <b>store,</b> which had to be done by halting the machine and manually initiating the transfer. These missing features were incorporated in the Final Specification version, which was fully working by October 1949. The machine contained 4,050 valves and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts. To increase reliability, purpose-built CRTs made by GEC were used in the machine instead of the standard devices used in the SSEM.|$|E
500|$|The SSEM's 32-bit {{word length}} was {{increased}} to 40 bits. Each word could hold either one 40-bit number or two 20-bit program instructions. The main store initially {{consisted of two}} double-density Williams tubes, each holding two arrays of 32 x 40-bit words– known as pages– backed up by a magnetic drum capable of storing an additional 32 pages. [...] The capacity was increased in the Final Specification version to eight pages of main store on four Williams tubes and 128 magnetic drum pages of <b>backing</b> <b>store.</b> The [...] diameter drum, initially known as a magnetic wheel, contained a series of parallel magnetic tracks around its surface, {{each with its own}} read/write head. Each track held 2,560bits, corresponding to twopages (2×32×40bits). One revolution of the drum took 30milliseconds, during which time both pages could be transferred to the CRT main memory, although the actual data transfer time depended on the latency, the time it took for a page to arrive under the read/write head. Writing pages to the drum took about twice as long as reading. The drum's rotational speed was synchronised to the main central processor clock, which allowed for additional drums to be added. Data was recorded onto the drum using a phase modulation technique still known today as Manchester coding.|$|E
2500|$|Until 1952, the {{available}} main memory (instructions and data) was only 512 18-bit words, {{and there was}} no <b>backing</b> <b>store.</b> The delay lines (or [...] "tanks") were arranged in two batteries providing 512 words each. The second battery came into operation in 1952.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} 1998, US News {{noted that the}} four major back-related <b>stores,</b> Healthy <b>Back</b> <b>Store,</b> Better <b>Back</b> <b>Store,</b> Relax the <b>Back,</b> and JoAnne's Bed & Back Shops, had a {{combined}} business of $75 million.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the Healthy <b>Back</b> <b>Store</b> {{acquired}} three Natural <b>Back</b> <b>Stores</b> in California, bringing the chain to 8 locations. Healthy Back bought out the Maryland-based Joanne's Bed and <b>Back</b> chain of <b>stores</b> for $600,000 in 2008 following the latter's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier that year. At {{the time of}} the merger, Healthy Back's sales were $40 million per year, and Joanne's $10 million. Joanne's had played a role in Mazlish's entry into the back business, when he purchased a back cushion from the chain's Tyson's Corner location upon first moving to the District in 1993.|$|R

One cited insert test of 1000 records was 20 times faster (than the original SQLite with its B-Tree implementation). [...] LMDB is available as a <b>backing</b> <b>store</b> for other open source projects including Cyrus SASL, Heimdal Kerberos, and OpenDKIM.

5000|$|Modified: The block {{has been}} {{modified}} in the cache. The {{data in the}} cache is then inconsistent with the <b>backing</b> <b>store</b> (e.g. memory). A cache with a block in the [...] "M" [...] state has the responsibility to write the block to the <b>backing</b> <b>store</b> when it is evicted.|$|E
50|$|A cache {{is made up}} of a pool of entries. Each entry has {{associated}} data, {{which is}} a copy of the same data in some <b>backing</b> <b>store.</b> Each entry also has a tag, which specifies the identity of the data in the <b>backing</b> <b>store</b> of which the entry is a copy.|$|E

50|$|The dirty bit {{allows for}} a {{performance}} optimization. A page on disk that is paged in to physical memory, then read from, and subsequently paged out again {{does not need to}} be written back to disk, since the page has not changed. However, if the page was written to after it is paged in, its dirty bit will be set, indicating that the page must be written back to the <b>backing</b> <b>store.</b> This strategy requires that the <b>backing</b> <b>store</b> retain a copy of the page after it is paged in to memory. When a dirty bit is not used, the <b>backing</b> <b>store</b> need only be as large as the instantaneous total size of all paged-out pages at any moment. When a dirty bit is used, at all times some pages will exist in both physical memory and the <b>backing</b> <b>store.</b>|$|E

Such a synthesizer {{is known}} as a rompler, as opposed to a sampler, which lets you record and load in custom samples. Nevertheless, sample playback can be slightly customized via editing its ADSR envelope and applying DSP effects, like reverb or chorus. A drawback is the absence of filters.|$|R

5000|$|Write-back (also called write-behind): initially, {{writing is}} done {{only to the}} cache. The write to the <b>backing</b> <b>store</b> is {{postponed}} until the cache blocks containing the data {{are about to be}} modified/replaced by new content.|$|E
50|$|When {{a system}} writes data to cache, it must {{at some point}} write that data to the <b>backing</b> <b>store</b> as well. The timing of this write is {{controlled}} by {{what is known as}} the write policy.|$|E
50|$|A {{write-back}} cache is {{more complex}} to implement, since it needs to track which of its locations have been written over, and mark them as dirty for later writing to the <b>backing</b> <b>store.</b> The data in these locations are written back to the <b>backing</b> <b>store</b> only when they are evicted from the cache, an effect {{referred to as a}} lazy write. For this reason, a read miss in a write-back cache (which requires a block to be replaced by another) will often require two memory accesses to service: one to write the replaced data from the cache back to the store, and then one to retrieve the needed data.|$|E

25|$|Lighting control tools {{might best}} be {{described}} as anything that changes the quality of the light. Historically this has been done by the use of intensity control. Technological advancements have made intensity control relatively simple - solid state dimmers are controlled by one or more lighting controllers. Controllers are commonly lighting consoles designed for sophisticated control over very large numbers of dimmers or luminaires, but may be simpler devices which play <b>back</b> <b>stored</b> sequences of lighting states with minimal user interfaces. Consoles are also referred to as lighting desks or light-boards.|$|R
