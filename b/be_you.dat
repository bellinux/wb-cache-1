5|$|Following Rhoda, Kavner had a guest {{appearance}} on Taxi and {{appeared in the}} 1985 comedy Bad Medicine {{as well as the}} 1987 film Surrender, both of which were box office failures. She appeared in the television movies Revenge of the Stepford Wives, No Other Love and A Fine Romance, and shot a television pilot. She also starred in several stage plays, including a play called It Had to <b>be</b> <b>You</b> at a dinner theater in Canada, Particular Friendships in New York City in 1981, and Two for the Seesaw, directed by Burt Reynolds. Woody Allen first saw Kavner one night while he was watching Rhoda in the 1970s. He thought that she was remarkable and later offered her a role in his 1986 film Hannah and Her Sisters. Kavner agreed, and credits Allen and the film with rejuvenating her career.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} verse, Beyoncé {{continues}} to dismiss her former lover as she sings, [...] "So sad, you're hurt / boo hoo ...", over a tinkling piano riff and bass drums. She then chants the ascendant chorus, which this time features soaring strings and an uplifting aggressive piano accompaniment. Nadine Cheung of AOL Radio noted that though Beyoncé rips through the verses, she sings the chorus and bridge with restraint; on the latter, she affirms {{that she has}} moved on in life. The song ends as Beyoncé repeatedly sings, [...] "What goes around comes back around / I bet it sucks to <b>be</b> <b>you</b> right now".|$|E
500|$|A pop and R ballad, the {{subjects}} of [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] are revenge and karma. Not wanting to feel broken-hearted, the female protagonist sings that she feels happy to have left her lover, who did not recognize {{the potential for a}} happy life with her. Some critics viewed it as a sequel to Beyoncé's 2006 single [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] as the two songs are thematically similar. However, some lyrics, including [...] "showed your ass" [...] and [...] "sucks to <b>be</b> <b>you</b> right now", were criticized. The ballad was also likened to Vanessa Carlton's 2002 single [...] "A Thousand Miles" [...] (2002).|$|E
500|$|... "Gotta Be You" [...] is a mid-tempo pop rock ballad.

Written in the key of Ab major, the song is set in common time at a moderate tempo of 85 beats per minute. Set in an orchestral arrangement, its instrumentation includes a guitar, piano lines, and abundant strings. The chorus of the song opens with falsettos that are followed by vocal harmonies. The lyrical content is characterised by love notions and prominently revolves around its main declaration, [...] "It's gotta <b>be</b> <b>you,</b> only you".|$|E

500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the speech's poor reception, Pitt effectively promised Cornwallis carte blanche to build support for union. [...] Portland wrote to Cornwallis, [...] "I hope it is unnecessary to assure your excellency that whatever your decisions may <b>be</b> <b>you</b> may depend upon their receiving the unreserved sanction and support of His Majesty's servants." [...] On the basis of these assurances, Cornwallis and Castlereagh developed a plan to coopt or convince enough of the propertied interests that controlled the parliament to support the union. [...] Cornwallis found this task, which occupied much of the next year, to be extremely distasteful: [...] "My occupation is now of the most unpleasant nature, negotiating and jobbing with the most corrupt people under heaven. [...] I despise and hate myself every hour for engaging in such dirty work, and am supported only by the reflection that without an Union the British Empire must be dissolved." [...] The task was made somewhat more pleasant by the arrival of his son for a short visit in July 1799.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} about the {{breakdown}} of a relationship between Beyoncé and her lover, a situation that suits both of them. They also touch on revenge and karma, particularly the opening line, [...] "What goes around comes back around", the lines [...] "Best thing I never had", [...] "Best thing you never had", and the closing line, [...] "Sucks to <b>be</b> <b>you</b> right now". Happy to have avoided heartbreak, Beyoncé continues to sing about her ex-lover, who did not recognize {{the possibility of a}} happy relationship with Beyoncé until the relationship broke down. Beyoncé no longer desires her lover after discovering his deceit; as shown in the pre-chorus and chorus lines, [...] "When I think of the time that I almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you / Thank God you blew it, I thank God I dodged a bullet / I’m so over you, so baby good looking out / I wanted you bad / I’m so through with that / Because honestly / You {{turned out to be the}} best thing I never had / And will always be the best thing you never had." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] also {{received}} a few mixed and negative reviews. Amos Barshad of New York magazine wrote that the ballad borrows more heavily from Beyoncé's own 2006 single [...] "Irreplaceable", and that [...] " [...] can't be a bad thing". However, he noted that [...] "this time in language ('Sucks to <b>be</b> <b>you</b> right now') agreeable to a nation of tweens and in a manner agreeable to anyone who likes yelping along in unison to ascendant pop choruses." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters wrote that lines like [...] "showed your ass" [...] and [...] "it must suck to be you" [...] exemplify lame lyrics. He concluded that, [...] " [...] are wondering how such lame lyrics could be sung with such earnestness." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that {{the most interesting thing}} about [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] is the curious image evoked by the chorus' lyric, noting that everything seemed fine until [...] "the protagonist's former amorata 'showed your ass'". Music Weeks Ben Cardew commented that its 1980s sound is [...] "not a highlight". A negative review came from Al Shipley of The Village Voice who wrote that [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and [...] "Party" [...] were [...] "among the album's worst and most unrepresentative songs".|$|E
500|$|... "Exposé" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews. Lindelof {{admitted that}} the episode [...] "created a varying degree of fan reaction", with some fans even describing it as [...] "filler".

I think it's entirely reasonable, and we sort of by necessity have to have episodes that aren't super-narratively, you know, propelled." [...] Daniel of TMZ.com said that the episode [...] "was a complete waste of time", and that although he [...] "wanted Nikki and Paulo to die", he did not think their deaths warranted an entire episode. Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen wrote that although he liked the cameo appearance of Billy Dee Williams, he did not think [...] "Exposé" [...] "will do much to change anyone's minds" [...] about Nikki and Paulo, who were already unpopular characters. Brooke Tarnoff, a writer for UGO.com, wrote that she was [...] "embarrassed" [...] for Lost. New York Magazine put [...] "Exposé" [...] at the top of its list of [...] "Twenty Most Pointless Lost Episodes". However, TV Guides Matt Roush very much praised the episode for [...] "weaving flashbacks that appeared to be posthumous but really weren't while providing clever new angles on classic Lost moments from previous seasons", Roush {{went on to say that}} [...] "Exposé" [...] was [...] "a welcome reminder that sometimes these producers really do seem to know what they're doing after all." [...] Chris Carabott of IGN also gave a positive review, stating that while Nikki and Paulo had no real impact on the overall storyline, [...] "their ultimate end made for an entertaining hour of television". The IGN staff later ranked [...] "Exposé" [...] 58th out of the 113 Lost episodes, describing it as [...] "one of the series' darkest and most fun episodes".|$|E
500|$|Castiel {{typically}} displays {{very little}} emotion and always exhibits an extremely somber disposition. Although {{it has been}} suggested angels possibly do not possess the ability to truly feel emotion, Castiel frequently exhibits affection towards Dean. This attachment and growing ability to feel even causes him to be [...] "demoted", as his superiors fear emotions are clouding his judgment. Throughout his appearances in the fourth season, he also seems to, at the very least, come close to expressing regret, hesitance, and anger several times, and has once quietly laughed at a joke Dean made in [...] "It's the Great Pumpkin, Sam Winchester". Actor Misha Collins feels, through Dean, [...] " [...] learning a little bit about humanity and re-learning something about [...] own humanity from that exposure. So...there's a humanizing of Castiel going on." [...] Castiel begins having an internal struggle between what is right and what is wrong, and whether or not to obey orders from Heaven. Collins feels this is because interactions with Sam and Dean have made the angel [...] "uncertain" [...] and [...] "more fragile". Collins believes Castiel envies Dean's decisiveness and desires to emulate him. Having lost his connection to Heaven in the fifth season, Castiel's humanization seems to have quickened by the episode [...] "Free to <b>Be</b> <b>You</b> and Me", as he appears extremely anxious while in a whorehouse, is visibly distraught when asking Dean for help, and refers to the Archangel Raphael as [...] "my little bitch". Despite becoming very arrogant when he becomes the [...] "new God", Castiel still shows his caring side and ultimately returns the souls to Purgatory and shows remorse for his actions, promising to Dean {{to find a way to}} redeem himself in Dean's eyes, showing that he cares about how Dean views him. After losing his memory, Castiel is more human than ever, but still displays some of his emotionless side. [...] After his memory returns, he shows real regret when he can't undo the damage he did to Sam and essentially sacrifices himself to save him out of remorse for his actions. After Castiel wakes up from his catatonic state, he is now depicted as insane with tendencies to ramble about random topics. [...] However, parts of Castiel's original personality are still shown with him still being happy to help Sam and Dean out and still knowledgeable about various supernatural things, but not willing to actually fight anymore even when his life is threatened. Castiel describes himself as [...] "bad luck" [...] and doesn't believe he should be around the Winchesters as a result. After traveling to Purgatory, Castiel regained his sanity, but still carries a lot of guilt about his previous actions. He is also now less distant from Sam and Dean and more appreciative of human things such as television.|$|E
