40|$|Abstract:-The pricing {{decision}} of three stages ecological industry chain {{of which is}} consisted of manufacturer producing mainproduct and <b>byproduct,</b> mainproduct seller and <b>byproduct</b> buyer is studied. Four kinds of pricing decision were discussed: manufacturer stackeberg equilibrium, mainproduct seller-manufacturer-byproduct buyer stackeberg equilibrium, buyer stackeberg equilibrium, alliance of mainproduct seller and <b>byproduct</b> buyer stackeberg equilibrium. Computational instances show that the system profit of manufacturer stackeberg equilibrium equals that of alliance of mainproduct seller and <b>byproduct</b> buyer stackeberg equilibrium, and is larger than that of other two equilibriums. Leader can obtain more profit than follower. The profit of buyer stackeberg equilibrium is less than other three equilibriums because both of mainproduct seller and <b>byproduct</b> buyer makes the price decision with manufacturer independently in the situation. Moreover, {{it is possible that}} the deal in the chain can not be made in buyer stackeberg equilibrium. Alliance of mainproduct seller and <b>byproduct</b> buyer should be the good way by which the system profit can be improved...|$|R
40|$|Annatto <b>byproduct</b> is {{the residue}} from the {{extraction}} of powder dye that covers the seed pericarp; after processing, between 94 % and 98 % of the original product is considered a <b>byproduct.</b> The aim was to evaluate the influence of increasing levels of annatto <b>byproduct</b> on the components of sheep body weight. Thirty-two male sheep, not castrated, with initial weight of 23. 17 Â± 1. 45 kg, without a defined breed, were used in randomized blocks in all four treatments (0, 100, 200 and 300 g kg? 1 of annatto <b>byproduct</b> in the diet dry matter). The increase to 300 g kg? 1 of annatto <b>byproduct</b> had a negative linear effect (P < 0. 05) for hot carcass weight (kg) and cold carcass weight (kg). Increasing levels of annatto <b>byproduct</b> resulted in a linear reduction (P < 0. 05) for palette weight (kg), leg weight (kg), carcass compactness index (kg cm? 1), liver weight (kg) and skin weight (kg).

5|$|Amanita aestivalis is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, {{meaning it}} forms a mutualistic relationship in which the vegetative hyphae of the fungus grow around and enclose the tiny roots of trees and shrubs. In this way, the plant is better able to absorb phosphorus and other soil nutrients, while the fungus receives moisture, protection, and nutritive <b>byproducts</b> of the plant's metabolism. Fruit bodies of the fungus grow {{on the ground in}} deciduous, coniferous, and mixed forests. A preference has been noted for oak woods containing Tsuga or Pinus species, as well as beech wood with Picea, Abies, and Betula. Fruit bodies typically appear from late June until autumn. In North America, it has been found in the states of New England, as well as Alabama, New York, and Virginia. The distribution extends north to the southeastern provinces of Canada and south to Florida.|$|E
5|$|Amanita rubrovoltata {{mushrooms}} grow {{in groups}} on the ground. Amanita species form mycorrhizal relationships with trees.

The original Japanese collections were made in forests dominated by Japanese beech (Fagus crenata), {{but it has also}} been found growing near Quercus luecotrichophora, Rhododendron arboreum, and Myrica esculenta in India, in Castanopsis-Schima forest in Nepal, and in Castanopsis indica plantations in the Himalayas.|$|E

5|$|Nitrous oxide (N2O), {{better known}} as {{laughing}} gas, is made by thermal decomposition of molten ammonium nitrate at 250Â°C.

5|$|The {{mechanism}} for unfolding of globular proteins is necessarily general, but somewhat {{dependent on the}} amino acid sequence. Long sequences of alternating glycine and alanine {{have been shown to}} inhibit substrate unfolding, decreasing the efficiency of proteasomal degradation; this results in the release of partially degraded <b>byproducts,</b> possibly due to the decoupling of the ATP hydrolysis and unfolding steps. Such glycine-alanine repeats are also found in nature, for example in silk fibroin; in particular, certain EpsteinâBarr virus gene products bearing this sequence can stall the proteasome, helping the virus propagate by preventing antigen presentation on the major histocompatibility complex.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} been found growing in small groups in the Guineo-Congolian rainforest. This forest is {{dominated}} by the single canopy tree species Gilbertiodendron dewevrei. Not only does this tree provide food in the form of edible seeds {{for a wide variety of}} large mammals, it forms mycorrhizal relationships with P.bembae. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of the plant, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive <b>byproducts</b> of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is thought to contribute to the success of the dominant species, by allowing it access to nutrients otherwise unavailable. The Congolian forests encompass an ecoregion known for its species richness and endemism, which is spread across four countries: Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, and the Central African Republic.|$|E
5|$|In human cells, and {{eukaryotic}} {{cells in}} general, DNA {{is found in}} two cellular locationsâ inside the nucleus and inside the mitochondria. Nuclear DNA (nDNA) exists as chromatin during non-replicative stages of the cell cycle and is condensed into aggregate structures known as chromosomes during cell division. In either state the DNA is highly compacted and wound up around bead-like proteins called histones. Whenever a cell needs to express the genetic information encoded in its nDNA the required chromosomal region is unravelled, genes located therein are expressed, and then the region is condensed back to its resting conformation. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is located inside mitochondria organelles, exists in multiple copies, and is also tightly associated {{with a number of}} proteins to form a complex known as the nucleoid. Inside mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS), or free radicals, <b>byproducts</b> of the constant production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation, create a highly oxidative environment that is known to damage mtDNA. A critical enzyme in counteracting the toxicity of these species is superoxide dismutase, which is present in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.|$|E
