40|$|Instream large wood in forested rivers creates diverse {{physical}} and ecological effects {{and is a}} vital component of river process and form. The majority of research on wood in rivers has been conducted within a limited geographic range, raising questions about the applicability of resulting insights. We analyze data from 438 river segments in old-growth or unmanaged forests and 250 river segments in lightly managed forests representing diverse environments. We evaluate whether drainage area, channel width, and channel slope influence instream wood load in unmanaged forests across bioclimatic regions. Here we show that, without accounting for variations across regions, these numeric variables do not correlate significantly with wood loads. When accounting for the influence of all available potential influences on wood load in unmanaged forest rivers, <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>region,</b> drainage area, and channel width are the dominant predictors of wood load, {{and the relationship between}} wood load and channel width differs between regions. Combining data across bioclimatic regions, unmanaged rivers have significantly greater wood loads than lightly managed forests. Splitting data by <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>region,</b> unmanaged rivers in the northern dry conifer and northern wet conifer regions have significantly greater wood loads than lightly managed forests, but wood loads in the northern wet deciduous region do not differ between unmanaged and lightly managed forests. Our findings suggest that (i) <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>region</b> is a critical factor in predicting and understanding wood dynamics in rivers, (ii) even historic or relatively light levels of timber harvest and wood removal can create persistent differences in wood loads, and (iii) substantial variation in wood load among river segments within a <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>region</b> suggests that riparian forest and river management should focus on processes that maintain wood loads capable of creating desired {{physical and}} ecological effects rather than specified volumes of wood...|$|E

Thus, investigating {{the role of}} wild carnivores as tick hosts is of relevance for understanding {{the life cycle of}} ticks in natural foci and the epidemiology of TBPs shared with domestic animals and humans. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the ixodid tick fauna of wild carnivores in Peninsular Spain and the environmental factors driving the risk of wild carnivores to be parasitized by ixodid ticks. We hypothesized that the adaptation of tick species to differing climatic conditions may be reflected in a similar parasitization risk of wild carnivores by ticks between bioclimatic regions in our study area. To test this, we surveyed ixodid ticks in wild carnivores in oceanic, continental-Mediterranean, and thermo-Mediterranean bioclimatic regions of Peninsular Spain. We analyzed the influence of environmental factors on the risk of wild carnivores to be parasitized by ticks by performing logistic regression models. Models were separately performed for exophilic and endophilic ticks under the expected differing influence of environmental conditions on their life cycle. We found differences in the composition of the tick community parasitizing wild carnivores from different bioclimatic regions. Modelling results partially confirmed our null hypothesis because <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>region</b> was not a relevant factor influencing the risk of wild carnivores to be parasitized by exophilic ticks. <b>Bioclimatic</b> <b>region</b> was however a factor driving the risk of wild carnivores to be parasitized by endophilic ticks. Spanish wild carnivores are hosts to a relevant number of tick species, some of them being potential vectors of pathogens causing serious animal and human diseases.

The index developed is based on the Fire Potential Index (FPI) applied by Sebastián (2001) at European scale and designed originally by Burgan (1998). The FPI is a dynamic Forest Fire Potential Index based on fuel characteristics and moisture status. The FPI uses the extinction moisture from fuel type map, the ten-hour timelag dead fuel moisture from meteorological data (temperature and relative moisture) and green vegetation percentage from Relative Greenness Vegetation Index. This research investigates the suitability of NDWI derived from MODIS satellite images to assess fire potential, and compares it with NDVI. The study period lasts from February 2000 to December 2005. The output of the model ranges between 1 and 100 and it is updated every eight days. The result of this study shows the usefulness of MODIS SWIR information for characterizing fire potential dynamics at a regional scale. In the bioclimatic Mediterranean region average values of both indexes (FPINDVI and FPINDWI) explain the uni-modal behaviour of forest fires typical of this area. In addition, both show a good correlation between forest fire potential and fires occurrence. In the Atlantic <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>region</b> FPINDWI explains better the bi-modal behaviour of forest fires than FPINDVI.

The work seeks to provide information on possible responses of extraordinary dry seasons on vegetation indices in a region with subtropical humide climate with low rainfall seasonality and evergreen forests.

The growth response of C. truncata to constant temperatures and soil moisture levels were measured and estimated respectively, to develop parameters for a CLIMEX bioclimatic model of potential distribution. The native distribution in eastern Australia and naturalised distribution in Western Australia was also used to inform the model. Associations with soil types were assessed within the suitable <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>region</b> in Australia. The global projection of the model was tested against the distribution of soil types and the known successful and failed global introductions. The verified model was then projected to future conditions due to climate change. Optimal temperature for plant development was 28 °C and the plant required 970 degree-days above a threshold of 10 °C. Early collection records indicate that the species is native to Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria.

RGRs and relative enzyme activities (RAs) of protease, amylase and cellulase were screened in seawater nutrient assay plates augmented with either skim milk, soluble starch or carboxymethylcellulose with trypan blue, respectively, across culture temperatures between 5 °C and 40 °C. Measures of RGR were fitted into third-degree polynomial and Brière- 2 temperature-dependent models to estimate optimum temperatures for growth (Topt) and maximum growth rates (RGRmax), and were used to calculate temperature coefficients (Q 10) and activation energies (Ea) for growth. All studied strains showed highest RGR and RA when grown using a skim milk nutrient assay. Topt for growth was 25 °C in F. equiseti and 20 °C in Pseudogymnoascus spp. Only F. equiseti showed cellulase activity. These data suggest a preference for protein-based substrates over plant-derived substrates for metabolism in these fungal strains.

40|$|WOS: 000392559300002 International audienceAmong the {{characteristic}} properties of timber from natural tree stands, {{particularly those in}} arid and semi-arid zones, variations in colour are decisive in the uses made of the wood as a high added-value visible material, in joinery and cabinet-making for example. This {{study was conducted to}} help promote the aesthetic value of a woody species which is common in Algeria but under-researched, the Mt. Atlas mastic tree, Pistacia atlantica Desf. Variations in wood colour were assessed from samples cut from the sapwood and heartwood of mastic trees from two different <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>regions</b> in north-western Algeria. The colour assessments were made at the Forest and Timber Resources Laboratory (LERFoB) in Nancy, France, using a spectrophotometer with measurement and display software. The results indicate variations between the two regions in the colour of Mt. Atlas mastic tree wood (for the three chromatic components L*, a* and b*) and among the different trees (component L*). The colorimetric components of the lighter-coloured sapwood, especially brightness (L*) and the red-green component (a*), are very different to those of the heartwood. From this we infer that environmental factors have an influence on the colorimetric characteristics of the wood in this species, as well as the intrinsic individual characteristics of each tree. Finally, brightness (L*) and the red-green (a*) and blue-yellow (b*) components vary between the different types of mastic tree wood...|$|R
40|$|Aim Understanding the {{conditions}} that promote biological invasions is a critical step to developing successful management strategies. However, the level of invasion is affected by complex interactions among environmental factors that might change across habitats and regions making broad generalizations uninformative for management. We aimed to quantify the context‐dependent association of climate and human activity at landscape scale (i. e. disturbance and propagule pressure) {{with the level of}} plant invasion at local scale across different stages of invasion, habitat types and bioclimatic regions. Location Mainland Spain. Methods Based on an extensive database of vegetation plots (~ 50, 000), we used hierarchical Bayesian models to test how climate and human activity at a landscape scale (i. e. land‐cover variables) are associated with establishment (i. e. presence) and dominance (i. e. relative species richness and abundance in invaded plots) of non‐native plants across nine habitat types and three bioclimatic regions. Results The association of climate with establishment and dominance of non‐native plants varied depending on habitat type but not <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>region.</b> These associations also varied depending on the stage of invasion under consideration. Establishment of non‐native species was more likely close to the coast, while their dominance increased in wet and warm continental areas. Human activity variables were associated with establishment and dominance similarly across bioclimatic regions. Non‐native species establishment and abundance peaked in human‐altered landscapes. Different habitats showed different susceptibilities to establishment versus dominance by non‐native species (e. g. woodlands had medium levels of establishment, but very low dominance). Main conclusions This study highlights how complex interactions among climate, human activity and habitats can determine patterns of invasions across broad landscapes. Successful management of plant invasions will depend on understanding these context‐dependent effects across habitats at the different stages of the invasion process...|$|E
40|$|Earth {{observation}} based {{monitoring of}} change in vegetation phenology and productivity is an important and widely used approach to quantify degradation of ecosystems due to climatic or human influences. Most satellite based studies apply linear or polynomial regression methods for trend detections. In this paper {{it is argued that}} natural systems hardly react to human or natural influences in a linear or a polynomial manner. At shorter time-scales of few decades natural systems fluctuate to a certain extent in a non-systematic manner without necessarily changing equilibrium. Finding a systematic model that describes this behavior on large spatial scales is certainly a difficult challenge. Furthermore, the manner vegetation phenology reacts to climate and to socio-economic changes is also dependent on the land cover type and on the <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>region.</b> In addition to this, traditional parametric methods require the fulfillment of several statistical criteria. In case these criteria are violated confidence intervals and significance tests of the models may be biased, even misleading. This paper proposes an alternative approach termed the Steadiness to traditional trend analysis methods. Steadiness combines the direction or tendency of the change and the net change of the time-series over a selected time period. It is a nonparametric approach which can be used without violation of statistical criteria, it can be applied on short time-series as well and results are not dependent on the significance test or on thresholds. To demonstrate differences, a time-series of satellite derived Season Length images for 24 years is analyzed for the entire European continent using linear regression and the Steadiness approach. Spatial and temporal change patterns and sensitivity to pre-processing algorithms are compared between the two methods. We show that linear regression limits the possibilities of assessing fluctuating ecosystem changes whereas the nonparametric Steadiness index more consistently confirms the fluctuating phenological change patterns.

40|$|Increases in {{atmospheric}} CO{sub 2 } concentration {{during the}} last 250 years are unequivocal, and CO{sub 2 } {{will continue to increase}} at least for the next several decades (Houghton et al. 2001, Keeling & Whorf 2002). Arid ecosystems {{are some of the most}} important biomes globally on a land surface area basis, are increasing in area at an alarming pace (Dregne 1991), and have a strong coupling with regional climate (Asner & Heidebrecht 2005). These water-limited ecosystems also are predicted to be the most sensitive to elevated CO{sub 2 }, in part because they are stressful environments where plant responses to elevated CO{sub 2 } may be amplified (Strain & Bazzaz 1983). Indeed, all C{sub 3 } species examined at the Nevada Desert FACE Facility (NDFF) have shown increased A{sub net} under elevated CO{sub 2 } (Ellsworth et al. 2004, Naumburg et al. 2003, Nowak et al. 2004). Furthermore, increased shoot growth for individual species under elevated CO{sub 2 } was spectacular in a very wet year (Smith et al. 2000), although the response in low to average precipitation years has been smaller (Housman et al. 2006). Increases in perennial cover and biomass at the NDFF are consistent with long term trends in the Mojave Desert and elsewhere in the Southwest, indicating C sequestration in woody biomass (Potter et al. 2006). Elevated CO{sub 2 } also increases belowground net primary production (BNPP), with average increases of 70 %, 21 %, and 11 % for forests, bogs, and grasslands, respectively (Nowak et al. 2004). Although detailed studies of elevated CO{sub 2 } responses for desert root systems were virtually non-existent prior to our research, we anticipated that C sequestration may occur by desert root systems for several reasons. First, desert ecosystems exhibit increases in net photosynthesis and primary production at elevated CO{sub 2 }. If large quantities of root litter enter the ecosystem at a time when most decomposers are inactive, significant quantities of carbon may be stored belowground in relatively recalcitrant forms. Indeed, a model-based analysis predicted that the arid/semiarid southwestern <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>region</b> had one of the highest rates of net carbon storage in the United States over the past century (Schimel et al. 2000). Second, root systems of desert plants are often extensive (Foxx et al. 1984, Hartle et al. 2006) with relatively large proportions of roots deep in the soil (Schenk & Jackson 2002). Thus, an understanding of belowground processes in desert ecosystems provides information on the potential for terrestrial carbon sequestration in desert ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUnderstanding how plant traits {{interact}} with climate to determine plant niches is decisive for predicting climate change impacts. While lifespan and seed size modify {{the importance of}} germination timing, germination traits such as base temperature and base water potential directly translate climatic conditions into germination timing, impacting performance in later life stages. Yet {{we do not know}} how base temperature, base water potential, seed mass, lifespan and climate are related. We tested the relationships between base temperature and base water potential for germination, seed size and lifespan while controlling for <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>regions.</b> We also quantified the phylogenetic signal in germination traits and seed size using Pagel's λ. We used a worldwide data set of germination responses to temperature and moisture, seed size and lifespan of 240 seed plants from 49 families. Both germination temperature and moisture are negatively related to seed size. Annual plants show a negative relation between seed size and base water potential, whereas perennials display a negative relation between base temperature and seed mass. Pagel's λ highlighted the slow evolution of base temperature for germination, comparable to seed mass while base water potential was revealed to be labile. In the future, base water potential and seed mass can be used when moisture niches of plants are to be predicted. Lifespan, seed size and base temperature should be taken into account when analysing thermal limits of species distributions...|$|R
40|$|Madagascar harbors a {{rich and}} diverse {{amphibian}} fauna, with over 280 nominal species of native frogs, {{all of which are}} endemic to the island. Although many species are threatened predominantly by habitat destruction, so far this fauna has not experienced any enigmatic declines as amphibians have {{in other parts of the}} globe. The amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), associated with mass amphibian die offs in Europe, the Americas and Australia has so far not been detected in Madagascar, but surveys so far were based mainly on histological examination of frog samples, with molecular data from only a single site. Here, we present results from a molecular screening of altogether 300 frog specimens belonging to 53 species in 13 genera, from 12 sites throughout Madagascar spanning all of Madagascar`s major <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>regions</b> and an array of different elevations from 20 to 2400 m above sea level. All samples were analyzed using a standard quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay and yielded only negative results, suggesting the widespread absence or very localized and low prevalence of the amphibian chytrid fungus across Madagascar during the sampling years 2006 and 2007.

40|$|Worldwide, {{satellite}} observations {{are used to}} assess the fire danger levels of grassland regions using inputs such as meteorological data, topographical data and fuel moisture content, which correlates closely to curing (senescence). This research presents a case study from Australia that assesses the utility of Earth observing satellites to predict grassland curing. Using the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) is utilised across the globe to monitor fire fuel potential. Since the 1980 s, this satellite sensor has been used operationally in Australia to produce a satellite-curing index, which was initially developed and validated from the combination of AVHRR and in situ curing observations. These in situ observations, however, were only collected from a small sample of improved pastures and may not be appropriate for other grassland types. In this research, Earth Observation System (EOS) MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data, collected from 2005 to 2008, were analysed and compared to in situ curing measurements at twenty-one field sites (of improved pastures, native and mixed grasslands) from different regions of Australia. Derived from the first seven MODIS bands, over thirty vegetation indices were investigated for curing prediction. While no vegetation index was found to outperform NDVI, this index was able to predict curing with an absolute error of 11. 84 % (on a scale of 0 to 100 %) for different grass types and in different <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>regions...</b>|$|R
