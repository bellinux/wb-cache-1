500|$|The show {{opened with}} Beastie Boys {{performing}} six of their songs for 30 minutes. They {{were accompanied by}} their DJ, Rick Rubin, who scratched the music, with The Beastie Boys prancing around the stage, making lewd gestures towards the audience. As they finished their performance, the backdrops started displaying Madonna's images from her music videos. The band—consisting of guitarists, bassists, a drummer and three synthesizer players—came into focus, and the music started. Madonna's voice was heard, saying: [...] "Don't be afraid... it's gonna be alright." [...] Then, Madonna's silhouette appeared behind a white screen {{on top of the}} stairs as the first beats kicked in. The white screen lifted and she is finally seen, wearing a psychedelic housecoat, a blue see-through crop-top and her characteristic black bra. She also had lacy leggings and crucifixes around her ear and her neck. She posed on the stairs before reaching the microphone to sing [...] "Dress You Up". After dancing to the last note of the music, Madonna and the two male back-up dancers went {{to the back of the}} stage, as the music of [...] "Holiday" [...] began. Taking a moment to ask the audience how they are feeling, Madonna declared, [...] "I was never elected homecoming queen, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> feel like one now", and started the performance of [...] "Into the Groove", playing a tambourine. A boombox was present on the stage during the performance, Madonna sitting and playing with it, and addressing it as her [...] "box". She continued with [...] "Everybody", while asking the audience to clap along with her. As she finished the vigorous performance of [...] "Everybody", the lights were dimmed and the introduction music of [...] "Angel" [...] started. Rotating lights fell on the stage. Madonna appeared sitting on top of the stairs and gradually descended. During the intermediate bridge, she and her dancers moved energetically around the whole stage, as white balloons fell on them from above. Madonna continued singing as the lights were dimmed again. She finished the performance and disappeared behind the wings for a costume change.|$|E
2500|$|The case {{resulted}} in much satire of Kennedy. Time reported {{immediately after the}} incident that [...] "One sick joke already visualizes a Democrat asking about Nixon during the 1972 presidential campaign: [...] "Would you let this man sell you a used car?" [...] Answer: [...] "Yes, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> wouldn't let that Teddy drive it." [...] A mock advertisement in National Lampoon magazine showed a floating Volkswagen Beetle with the remark that Kennedy would have been elected president had he been driving a Beetle that night; the satire {{resulted in}} legal action by Volkswagen, claiming unauthorized use of its trademark.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Scott {{played the}} Fairy Godmother in Cinderella at summer camp. During Christmas season, she took part in pageants at the local Catholic church her family attended. When asked what was the best advice she was given, Scott replied, [...] "I don't know, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> didn't take it." [...] Her mother told her to subdue her {{emotions}} and [...] "be a lady", but despite a strict Catholic upbringing, Scott described herself as having been [...] "rebellious and outspoken" [...] as a young girl. However, Scott mentioned adolescent favorites such as Ralph Waldo Emerson's Essays as having the greatest influence on her.|$|E

2500|$|Although he {{continued}} to work with William Shatner in the Star Trek films, Doohan did not get along well with him and was once quoted as saying, [...] "I like Captain Kirk, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> don't like Bill." [...] He was the only former Star Trek co-star to decline {{to be interviewed by}} Shatner for Shatner's first Star Trek: Memories book about the show, nor did he consent to do so for Shatner's follow-up book, Star Trek: Movie Memories, though Shatner mentioned in the latter that the icy relationship between the two started to thaw when both men were working on Star Trek Generations in 1993-94. At Doohan's final August 2004 convention appearance, Doohan and Shatner appeared to have mended their relationship.|$|E
2500|$|... company, {{independent}} of the HAS [...] but fed by the HAS. We don't want a clinic. We want one in operation but not in name. Perhaps we could call it a Spiritual Guidance Center. Think up its name, will you. And we could put in nice desks and our boys in neat blue with diplomas {{on the walls and}} 1.knock psychotherapy into history and 2.make enough money to shine up my operating scope and 3.keep the HAS solvent. It is a problem of practical business. I await your reaction on the religion angle. In my opinion, we couldn't get worse public opinion than we have had or have less customers with what we've got to sell. A religious charter would be necessary in Pennsylvania or NJ to make it stick. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> could make it stick. We're treating the present time beingness, psychotherapy treats the past and the brain. And brother, that's religion, not mental science.|$|E
2500|$|In overview, {{the works}} for the double album in this period were {{intended}} to be packaged in a plain brown wrapper, with a [...] "strictly personal" [...] over-stamp and addressed {{in a manner that}} could have connotations of drug content, pornographic or illicit material; As per the small ads of the time: [...] "It comes to you in a plain brown wrapper." [...] Given that Krasnow had effectively poached the band from Buddah there were limitations on what material could be released. Strictly Personal was the result, contained in its enigmatically-addressed parcel sleeve. The raft of material left behind eventually emerged, firstly on CD as I May Be Hungry, <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>Sure</b> Ain't Weird and later on vinyl, implemented by John French, as It Comes To You in a Plain Brown Wrapper (which has two tracks that are missing from the former release). Both Blue Thumb and the stamps on the cover of Strictly Personal have LSD connotations, as does the track Ah Feel Like Ahcid, although Beefheart himself refuted this (claiming that this is a rendering of [...] "I feel like I said").|$|E
