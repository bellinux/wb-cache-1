40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} of the possible using of <b>brewer’s</b> <b>grain</b> as a source of growth substabces in acetone-butanol fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates {{in order to reduce the}} cost of biobutanol production and to utilize the brewery waste. The fermentation of glucose was carried out at different concentrations of the <b>brewer’s</b> <b>grain</b> by Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. In the experiments on fermentation of the lignocellulosic hydrolysates an enzymatic hydrolysate of miscanthus cellulose containing 34. 8 g/l glucose and 15. 6 g/l xylose was used as a source of reducing substances. The sterilization of the medium was carried out at 0. 5 KPa for 20 minutes. The sterilization of the growth and reducing substances sources was conducted separately to prevent caramelization of products and melanoidins. For inoculation the spores of 3 % (vol/vol) C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 were transferred to a fresh medium. The strain was grown at 37 °С under anaerobic conditions. In a series of experiments on the evaluation of the influence of the <b>brewer’s</b> <b>grain</b> on the fermentability of carbohydrates by the strain of C. acetobutylicum АТСС 824, limiting and inhibitive concentrations of <b>brewer’s</b> <b>grain</b> were determined in the medium, which were 2 and 20 % vol., respectively. The optimal amount of the <b>brewer’s</b> <b>grain</b> was about 6 % vol. At the optimal concentration of the <b>brewer’s</b> <b>grain</b> the fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates occured in all replicates. It was characterized by intensive gas and foam formation that corresponds to the data in literature. After 79 - 88 h of fermentation of miscanthus cellulose hydrolysate the product yield amounted 10. 14 ± 0. 87 g/L butanol, 02. 48 ± 0. 53 acetone, 01. 02 ± 0. 42 g/L ethanol. It was found that at an optimum concentration both the fresh and sour <b>brewer’s</b> <b>grain</b> can be used in the fermentation. After the acetone-butanol fermentation the <b>brewer’s</b> <b>grain</b> can be used as a food for farm animals.

40|$|Thirty-four {{lactating}} Friesian cows were {{allocated to}} two groups. At {{the beginning of}} lactation two cows were paired according to parity, weight and date of parturition. One group was randomly allocated to stover-based diet (SBD) and another to grass-based diet (GBD). The basal feeds (stover or grass) were given on ad lib basis. Lucerne and dried <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> were fed on group basis in the drylot. Dairy meal was given individually according to milk yield at rate of 500 g/litre after the first 8 litres. Daily intake of Lucerne, <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> and the basal feeds were significantly different (P 0. 05) in take of dairy meal was observed between the treatments. Stage of lactation was found to influence daily intake of Lucerne, <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> (P 0. 05) between the treatments. SBD cows produced more milk (P 0. 05) between the treatments. Based on the similarities of body weight, body condition score and milk composition between the treatments and the high milk yield by SBD, sorghum stover can thus be used to feed fat cows during lactation. This will stimulate mobilization of body fat. However, since energy intake would limit milk yield in the long run, a high-energy feedstuff such as silage need to be introduced to maintain high milk yield. Too much reliance on body condition as a buffer to overcome nutrition shortcomings, such as the case with stover fed cows, would lead to reduced milk yield in cows with insufficient body reserves...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the supply of wet <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> silage with and without nutrient additives in ensiling (wheat bran, soybeans hulls and ground corn), and the effect of additives on the intake and digestibility of dry matter and nutrients as well as the efficiency, production and milk composition of Holstein cows. Four multiparous Holstein cows were used, with an average milk production of 25 liters per day. The cows were randomly assigned, via the Latin Square design (4 x 4), to one of four experimental diets. The experimental period was 21 days. The results obtained in the experiment were evaluated by analysis of variance, Fisher’s F test and Tukey’s test at 5 % probability. The experimental diets consisted of wet <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> silage alone, and this silage with the addition of wheat bran, soybean hulls or ground corn. The diets did not affect the initial body weight of the animals. Diets containing wheat bran and ground corn provided a higher intake of dry matter (21. 78 and 21. 50 kg day- 1) and organic matter (20. 42 and 20. 22 kg day- 1) compared to the wet <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> silage alone and the diet containing soybean hulls. The results observed for dry matter (636. 96 and 632. 96 g kg- 1), organic matter (659. 16 and 654. 35 g kg- 1 DM), crude protein (712. 84 and 717. 79 g kg- 1 DM) and neutral detergent fiber (598. 99 and 538. 90 g kg- 1 DM) when cows were fed diets containing soybean hulls and ground corn, respectively, were higher than other diets. The different diets did not change daily milk production, milk production corrected for 3. 5 % fat or milk composition. The milk urea nitrogen from cows fed ground corn diets was a lower concentration (17. 67 mg dL- 1), however, it was still above the suitable range (10 to 14 mg dL- 1). Providing wet <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> silage with soybeans hulls or ground corn to Holstein cows increased the digestibility of dry matter and nutrients.

Twenty-eight different feedstuff samples were placed in 4. 5 X 6. 5 cm nylon bags, and were then incubated in the rumen for different periods of time (0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h). Under 8 % of rumen solid outflow rate, the percentages of the calculated protein degradability were: corn gluten meal, 8. 8; feather meal, 29. 1; soya pomace, 79. 1; <b>brewers</b> <b>grain,</b> 37. 1; distillers grain, 53. 9; meat and bone meal, 51. 9; wheat bran, 76. 8; corn, 34. 6, respectively.

40|$|The {{effects of}} Lactobacillus mucosae (L. mucosae), a {{potential}} direct fed microbial previously {{isolated from the}} rumen of Korean native goat, on the rumen fermentation profile of <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> were evaluated. Fermentation was conducted in serum bottles each containing 1 % dry matter (DM) of the test substrate and either no L. mucosae (control), 1 % 24 h broth culture of L. mucosae (T 1), or 1 % inoculation with the cell-free culture supernatant (T 2). Each serum bottle was filled anaerobically with 100 mL of buffered rumen fluid and sealed prior to incubation for 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h from which fermentation parameters were monitored and the microbial diversity was evaluated. The results revealed that T 1 had higher total gas production (65. 00 mL) than the control (61. 33 mL) and T 2 (62. 00 mL) (p< 0. 05) at 48 h. Consequently, T 1 had significantly lower pH values (p< 0. 05) than the other groups at 48 h. Ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N), individual and total volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentration and acetate:propionate ratio were higher in T 1 and T 2 than the control, but T 1 and T 2 were comparable for these parameters. Total methane (CH 4) production and carbon dioxide (CO 2) were highest in T 1. The percent DM and organic matter digestibilities were comparable between all groups at all times of incubation. The total bacterial population was significantly higher in T 1 (p< 0. 05) at 24 h, but then decreased to levels comparable to the control and T 2 at 48 h. The {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} profile of the total bacterial 16 s rRNA showed higher similarity between T 1 and T 2 at 24 h and between the control and T 1 at 48 h. Overall, these results suggest that addition of L. mucosae and cell-free supernatant during the in vitro fermentation of dried <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> increases the VFA production, but has no effect on digestibility.

Diets were evaluated for nutritional adequacy using the CPM Dairy program. Average milk yield on the day of sampling was 22. 8 L/day. The combination of grazed pasture with grain fed during milking was the most prevalent feeding system (54 %) in all areas. This was followed by combination of pelleted grain/by-products combined with pasture grazing (25 %). Only one herd in the study was not feeding any form of concentrates at the time of sampling. The estimated percentage of concentrate in the diet ranged from 25 % +/- 11. 6 to 44 % +/- 12. 0. Wheat, which was fed at up to 9. 8 kg/cow. day DM was the most prevalent grain in all areas, except for Gippsland.

By-products were prevalent, with <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> and wheat millrun the most commonly used, fed at 2. 8 and 1. 6 kg/cow. day DM, respectively. Most farms (81 / 100) incorporated at least one type of 'buffer' in the ration, and limestone (67 %) was the most prevalent mineral additive. Monensin and virginiamycin were fed in all areas, with a varying prevalence. Feeding or dose rates used for minerals and rumen modifiers were not always appropriate to those recommended for mineral needs or control of rumen function.

40|$|The basic {{purpose of}} feeding trials {{is to find}} the optimum level of feed {{ingredients}} which give the highest economical returns to the farmers. This can be achieved through estimation and comparison of means of different rations. The example we have is a study of incorporation of different levels of ensiled <b>brewers</b> <b>grains</b> in the diet of 24 hybrids weaned piglets from Landrace x Duroc x Berkshire x Large White. They were randomly divided into four groups with three replicates of two piglets per pen.

Comparing of several multivariate treatment means model design analysis is adapted. We obtain the MANOVA (Multiple Analyse of Variance) table of each phase, where the treatment differences exist by using Wilk's lambda distribution, and we find the treatment effect by using a confidence interval method of MANOVA.

40|$|Exploring and {{evaluating}} alternative feed ingredients {{to be used}} in swine diet is essential due to highly variable cost and limited availability of conventional feed ingredients. Tubers and agro-industrial coproducts could provide the basis for producing affordable swine feed. However, information on the nutritional value of these potential alternative feedstuffs is necessary while considering their use in swine feeding program. Four tubers (purple sweet potato [PSP], okinawan sweet potato, taro and cassava) and 3 coproducts (okara, wheat millrun [WMR] and barley <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> [BBG]) were analyzed for their proximate nutrients, starch, fibers and gross energy (GE) content. Two independent in vitro studies were carried out for tubers and coproducts to determine their nutrients digestibility using a 3 -step enzymatic assay (which mimics the digestion occurring in the gastrointestinal tract of swine) with 9 replicates of each sample digested in 3 batches equally. All replicate samples were used to determine in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDDM) while 2 replicates from each batch were used to determine in vitro GE digestibility (IVDGE). Among tubers, CP content was the highest in taro (8. 8 %) and the lowest in cassava (3. 7 %), while CP content among coproducts was the highest in okara (22. 7 %) and the lowest in WMR (11. 8 %). Ether extract content among tubers ranged from 1. 1 % to 2. 8 %. The GE content among tubers, ranged from 4, 134 to 4, 334  kcal/kg whereas among coproducts it ranged from 4, 270 to 4, 794  kcal/kg. Among tubers, IVDDM for PSP was significantly higher (86. 8 %, P <  0. 001) than taro (70. 3 %). Among coproducts, IVDDM of okara (74. 1 %) was significantly higher (P <  0. 05) than BBG (61. 3 %). In conclusion, both tubers and coproducts {{can be used as a}} partial substitute of conventional energy feedstuffs in swine diets as these are rich in GE and other nutrients and are fairly digestible...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this trial was to document the total fatty acids in Murrah buffaloes milk on commercial farms in Brazil. Data from forty lactating Murrah-crossbred buffaloes were collected on five commercial farms located at Sarapui and Pilar do Sul, Sao Paulo-Brazil. A field survey was done from April to November 2002. In four farms, buffaloes were fed with wet brewers grains (primary concentrate). Only one farm (Farm 4) offered pasture and corn silage. Monthly milk samples were collected and stored at - 20 ºC until analyzed for fatty acid composition. The fatty acids with the highest percentage in total milk fat were C 16 : 0; C 18 : 1 c 9; C 18 : 0 and C 14 : 0. The average content observed in C 16 : 0 varied from 25. 4 to 32. 5 %. Farm 4 (pasture plus corn silage) showed a higher C 16 : 0 value (32. 5 %). C 18 : 1 c 9 varied from 20. 6 to 25. 1 %, C 14 : 0 varied from 5. 9 to 8. 9 % and CLA content (C 18 : 2 c 9 t 11) varied from 1. 0 to 1. 8 %. Farm 3 presented higher average of C 18 : 1 c 9 (25. 1 %) and C 18 : 2 c 9 t 11 (1. 8 %), and lower average of C 14 : 0 (6. 0 %). Likewise, unsaturated fatty acids, C 18 : 1 c 9 and C 18 : 2 c 9 t 11 were higher on Farm 3. Probably, these results can be due to high CLA intakes derived from wet <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> and pasture. Long chain fatty acids varied from 34. 2 % (Farm 4) to 48. 8 % (Farm 3).

40|$|The (water) -soluble {{fraction}} of feeds is often {{assumed to be}} completely and immediately degraded in the rumen. The objective {{of this study was}} to separate the washout fraction (fraction A) obtained usually by difference after submitting the nylon bags to the machine-washing program, to investigate the nature and the degradation of the soluble crude protein in the washout fraction. The washout fraction obtained in vitro (filtrate) of 10 feeds was collected in water using nylon mesh as a filter. The feeds used in the study were: two grass silages, soybean meal, three corn gluten feeds, lupine meal, rapeseed meal, wet <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> silage and corn gluten feed silage. Average N losses during filtration and from machine-washed nylon bags ranged from 15 % (rape seed meal) to 74 % (grass silage) and were not different between procedures. N recovered in the filtrate ranged from 12 % (soybean meal) to 60 % (corn gluten feed silage) of sample N. The three fractions obtained from the filtrate were: soluble protein (TP), non-protein N (NPN) and fine particles (NS). The NS fraction was obtained after centrifugation of the filtrate and comprised 0 % to 87 % of N in the filtrate. Soluble protein (TP) in the supernatant was obtained after precipitation with trichloroacetic acid and N in the remaining supernatant was defined as non-protein N (NPN). Significant amounts of TP were found in soybean meal (58 %), lupine meal (30 %) and rapeseed meal (27 %) as percent of total N in the filtrate. NPN ranged from 13 % to 100 % of N in the filtrate. The in vitro incubation of the protein N (NS + TP) showed that all fractions were not completely degraded, suggesting a potential participation as escape protein. Fine particles in the filtrate have similar degradation rates as the residue left in the filter. It is concluded that the washout fraction consisted of different crude protein fractions that were not always completely and immediately degraded in the rumen...|$|E

While coconut husk {{was used as the}} bedding, the earthworms were fed with <b>brewer’s</b> dried <b>grain,</b> coconut husk or no extra feed other than the bedding. Growth {{performance of}} the earthworms was measured every week. The proximate composition of the earthworm was conducted using standard procedures. The mean weight of the earthworms under the three different treatments was significantly different (P < 0. 05); with earthworms fed <b>brewers</b> dried <b>grain</b> recording the highest mean weight (1. 03 ± 0. 50). No significant difference was observed in the percentage crude fibre, crude protein and moisture between A. millsoni from different treatments; whereas a significant difference (P < 0. 05) was observed in the percentage crude fat and ash between A. millsoni from the different treatments with A. millsoni fed <b>brewers</b> dried <b>grain</b> recording the highest percentage crude fat. Weight of worms was significantly and positively correlated to feed source (P < 0. 05). The implication of this is that earthworms fed with <b>brewers</b> dried <b>grain</b> gained weight above those fed with coconut husk or the control but the weight gain observed may have been {{as a result of the}} increase in crude fat content of the earthworms since there was no difference in their crude protein content.

40|$|Chemical {{composition}} of feedstuffs commonly included in dairy cow rations is variable within a feed type, which raises {{a potential for}} nutrient inadequacies for an animal. There are multiple methods to characterize and determine chemical composition including in vitro and in situ methods, as well as refining processing procedures to produce a consistent feed product. Feed component digestibilities can also be evaluated using similar methods. Research reported in Chapter 2 focuses on characterizing chemical composition and determining the digestibility of fiber and protein fractions of corn dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) originating from seven different production sites across Michigan, South Dakota, and Nebraska. Results indicate that chemical {{composition of}} DDGS, including amino acid composition and fatty acid composition, differed significantly among sources suggesting that processing procedures are variable and frequent analysis of chemical composition should be conducted to ensure quality control. Protein digestibility was determined using the Ross et al. (2013) method, with significant differences being reported among DDGS samples {{in the areas of}} rumen-undegradable protein (RUP), RUP digestibility, and total-tract digestible protein on both a crude protein and dry matter basis. Fiber digestibility was determined through a series of varying in vitro incubation periods, as well as using the Combs (2013) method of in vitro total-tract neutral detergent fiber digestibility. Significant differences were observed across all DDGS samples for protein and fiber digestibility estimates across production sites. Chapter 3 describes the second experiment, focusing on quantifying the extent of microbial contamination of eleven different feedstuffs with varying chemical compositions. Feeds used in this study included alfalfa hay, bloodmeal, wet <b>brewers</b> <b>grain,</b> canola meal, citrus pulp, corn silage, corn dried distillers grains with solubles, grass hay, soybean meal, soy hulls, and SoyPass®. Samples were weighed into nylon bags and ruminally incubated for 16 hours to determine DM digestibility (DMD) and the RUP fraction. After ruminal incubation, samples were lightly rinsed, DNA was extracted, and concentrations of DNA were obtained using spectrophotometry. DNA samples were then run through a droplet digitial polymerase chain reaction procedure in order to quantify the extent of microbial contamination on each feed sample. As expected, chemical composition and DMD differed across feedstuffs. Microbial contamination upwardly biased RUP estimates and the extent of this contamination differed across feedstuffs, suggesting there may be an opportunity to increase our understanding of chemical composition of dietary components and the effect they have on the extent of microbial contamination.

40|$|Forage legumes (FL) {{are used}} in {{tropical}} countries to feed pigs, either by reducing allowance of well-balanced diets and supplementing with FL or by incorporating FL in unbalanced fibre-rich diets. The impact of both strategies on animal and economical performances was studied in 2 growth experiments. In Exp. 1, 4 groups of 8 growing pigs (25. 5 +- 4. 2 kg) were fed under one of 4 dietary treatment: a well-balanced diet (CONTROL) ad libitum or 80 % of the ad libitum level of CONTROL + ad libitum freshly cut foliage of one of 3 FL species (Vigna unguiculata, Stylosanthes guinanensis, or Psophocarpens scandens). Similarly, in Exp. 2, 4 groups of 6 pigs (22. 6 +- 3. 7 kg) were fed one of 4 experimental diets: the well-balanced diet (CONTROL), an unbalanced traditional diet rich in fibre and made of bran, <b>brewers</b> <b>grain,</b> and corn (TRAD) or 80 % TRAD diet supplemented with 20 % of one of 2 FL hays (V. unguiculata or S. guinanensis). Animals were regularly weighed and feed intake was monitored. After 90 d, animals were slaughtered and carcass composition and economic traits were recorded to calculate production costs and economical value. In addition, nutritive value of the FL and the diets was assessed {{by means of an}} in vitro model of the pig digestive tract combining an enzymatic hydrolysis to a fermentation with a fecal inoculum. Results indicate that pigs fed diets with FL (Exp. 1) and TRAD with and without FL (Exp. 2) had reduced ADG, final live and carcass weights (P< 0. 05) compared to CONTROL pigs. Surprisingly, dry matter intake (DMI) was also reduced by 10 % with those diets compared to CONTROL (P< 0. 001) in both experiments. In Exp. 1, FCR and carcass dressing were not affected by the 20 % reduction in CONTROL diet and supplementation with fresh FL, while in Exp. 2 those parameters were negatively affected in TRAD with and without FL compared to CONTROL pigs. In vitro data showed that differences in nutritive values explained most differences in growth performances and carcass traits, but not the decrease in intake, since passage rate and voluntary intake are not taken into account in the in vitro model. Economical assessment showed that fresh foliage of FL could increase incomes, as long as their production costs remain marginal, but the incorporation of FL hays could not improve economical performances in pigs fed traditional unbalanced fibre-rich diets.

Commercial swine diets are {{composed}} mainly of ingredients such as corn, wheat and soybean to meet energy and protein requirements. Market availability of these ingredients is variable due to limited production {{as well as}} competition among food, feed and fuel. Hence, in order to assure sustainability of swine production in places like Hawaii, alternative feeding system need to be studied, developed and extended. Some agricultural products like purple sweet potato(PSP), okinawan sweet potato (OSP), cassava and taro and some agricultural co-products like macadamia nut cake (MNC), okara, wheat millrun (WMR) and barley <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> (BBG), are available locally which could together provide basis for producing more affordable locally manufactured feeds. However, limited information available on nutritional value and digestibility of these potential feedstuffs, limits their use in routine swine feed formulation. The agricultural products and agricultural co-products were obtained from local market to determine nutrient profile and in vitro digestibility. Among the agricultural products, crude protein (CP) content was highest in taro (8. 8 %) and lowest in cassava (3. 7 %). Ether extract (EE) was highest in PSP (2. 7 %) and lowest in cassava (1. 0 %). Acid detergent fiber (ADF) content was highest in taro (10. 3 %) and lowest in PSP (5. 6 %). Neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content was highest in taro (11. 4 %) and lowest in PSP (7. 9 %). The starch content was highest in cassava (60. 8 %) and lowest in taro (38. 4 %). Gross energy was highest in taro (4333 Kcal/kg) and lowest in PSP (4134). Among the agricultural co-products. Crude protein content was highest in MNC (25. 5 %) and lowest in BBG (11. 7 %). Ether extract content was highest in okara (13. 3 %) and lowest in BBG (1. 7 %). The ADF content was highest in MNC (28. 0 %) and lowest in okara (19. 7 %). The NDF content was highest in WMR (42. 0 %) and lowest in okara (31. 0 %). The MNC had 2. 8 and 0. 2 %, linoleic acid and linolenic acid content, respectively, lysine concentration was 0. 7 %. In vitro dry matter digestibility was significantly higher (P ˂ 0. 001) in PSP (86. 8 %) than taro (70. 3 %). In vitro gross energy digestibility was significantly higher (P ˂ 0. 001) in PSP (87. 5 %) than taro (64. 9 %). In vitro crude protein digestibility was significantly higher (P ˂ 0. 05) in PSP (76. 3 %) and cassava (74. 4 %) than taro (63. 1 %) and OSP (63. 1 %).
