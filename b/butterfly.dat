5|$|As {{discussed}} above, any non-pseudoforest graph contains as a subgraph a handcuff, {{figure 8}}, or theta graph; any handcuff or figure 8 graph may be contracted {{to form a}} <b>butterfly</b> graph (five-vertex figure 8), and any theta graph may be contracted to form a diamond graph (four-vertex theta graph), so any non-pseudoforest contains either a <b>butterfly</b> or a diamond as a minor, {{and these are the}} only minor-minimal non-pseudoforest graphs. Thus, a graph is a pseudoforest if and only if it does not have the <b>butterfly</b> or the diamond as a minor. If one forbids only the diamond but not the <b>butterfly,</b> the resulting larger graph family consists of the cactus graphs and disjoint unions of multiple cactus graphs.|$|E

However, some <b>butterflies</b> feed from the 'feeding trays', placed {{throughout}} the gardens. In the feeding trays, fermenting fruit is provided and the <b>butterflies</b> feed off of the naturally produced alcohol.

5|$|<b>Butterfly</b> {{adults are}} {{characterized}} by their four scale-covered wings, which give the Lepidoptera their name (Ancient Greek λεπίς lepís, scale + πτερόν pterón, wing). These scales give <b>butterfly</b> wings their colour: they are pigmented with melanins that give them blacks and browns, as well as uric acid derivatives and flavones that give them yellows, {{but many of the}} blues, greens, reds and iridescent colours are created by structural coloration produced by the micro-structures of the scales and hairs.|$|E
