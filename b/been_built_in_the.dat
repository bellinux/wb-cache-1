5|$|The {{original}} town of Ashford, {{like many}} other settlements, has outgrown its original size and has combined with smaller villages in a conurbation. These villages include Bockhanger, Kennington, Sevington, Singleton and Willesborough. In addition, housing estates have <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open spaces amongst Bybrook, Godinton, Kingsnorth, Park Farm and Stanhope.|$|E

5|$|Christian baptisteries and shrines were domed in the 4th century, {{such as the}} Lateran Baptistery and {{the likely}} wooden dome over the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Constantine's {{octagonal}} palace church in Antioch {{may have been the}} precedent for similar buildings for centuries afterward. The first domed basilica may have <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 5th century, with a church in southern Turkey being the earliest proposed example, but the 6th century architecture of Justinian made domed church architecture standard throughout the Roman east. His Hagia Sophia and Church of the Holy Apostles inspired copies in later centuries.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> hotel <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{seventeenth century}} for the Silvy family, {{a family of}} landowners and magistrates from Aix. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> garden, <b>the</b> {{fountain}} <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth century.|$|R

5|$|Country estates had <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area {{as early}} as the 1830s, and some of Louisville's great early mansions, {{predominantly}} in the Italianate style, were built along Broadway, very near Old Louisville, before the Civil War. Development from 1850 to 1870 occurred between Broadway and Kentucky Street, the northern extreme of what came to be called Old Louisville. North-south city streets were extended throughout the area in the 1850s, and a mulecar line was extended down Fourth to Oak in 1865.|$|E
5|$|Deserts are {{increasingly}} seen as sources for solar energy, {{partly due to}} low amounts of cloud cover. Many successful solar power plants have <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mojave Desert. These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) making them the largest solar power installation in the world. Large swaths of this desert are covered in mirrors, including nine fields of solar collectors. The Mojave Solar Park is currently under construction and will produce 280MW when completed.|$|E
5|$|Garrick {{commissioned}} Robert Adam and {{his brother}} James to renovate the theatre's interior, which they did in 1775. Their additions included an ornate ceiling and a stucco facade facing Bridges Street. This facade {{was the first time}} any structure that might be considered part of the theatre proper actually abutted the street: the building, like the 1663 original, had <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre of the block, hemmed in by other structures. The narrow passage from Bridges street to the theatre now became an interior hallway; some theatre office space also went up behind the new facade.|$|E

5|$|One major {{advantage}} Manchester has is that, {{unlike most}} major {{cities in the}} UK, there are no height restrictions and adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards city centre high rises. As a result, in the 2000s (decade), {{there has been a}} renewed interest in building skyscrapers in Manchester and other cities in Britain. Several residential, hotel and office developments are under construction or have recently <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city centre, including the Beetham Tower.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} many other Mathas as well. The Emar Matha {{was founded by}} the Tamil Vaishnava saint Ramanujacharya in the 12th century AD. This Matha, which is now located in front of Simhadvara across the eastern corner of the Jagannath Temple, is {{reported}} to have <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 16th century during the reign of kings of Suryavamsi Gajapatis. The Matha was in the news on 25 February 2011 for the large cache of 522 silver slabs unearthed from a closed chamber.|$|E
50|$|The {{tower of}} the parish church of Lindlar <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12th century and remains till today, {{although}} <b>the</b> tower's roof <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th century.

50|$|The village parish {{church of}} St. John was first {{mentioned}} in 1227 when Emperor Frederick II granted {{it to the}} Teutonic Knights. <b>The</b> current aisle <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 13th or 14th century, the choir is from 1452 and <b>the</b> church tower <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> 1512-16. <b>The</b> first village school <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 17th century.|$|R
5|$|The city of Tiruchirappalli lies on {{the plains}} between the Shevaroy Hills {{to the north and}} the Palni Hills to the south and south-west. Tiruchirappalli is {{completely}} surrounded by agricultural fields. Densely populated industrial and residential areas have recently <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern part of the city, and the southern edge also has residential areas. The older part of Tiruchirappalli, within the Rockfort, is unplanned and congested while the adjoining newer sections are better executed. Many of the old houses in Srirangam were constructed according to the shilpa sastras, the canonical texts of Hindu temple architecture.|$|E
5|$|The first {{armoured}} cruisers had <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1870s, as {{an attempt}} to give armour protection to ships fulfilling the typical cruiser roles of patrol, trade protection and power projection. However, the results were rarely satisfactory, as the weight of armour required for any meaningful protection usually meant that the ship became almost as slow as a battleship. As a result, navies preferred to build protected cruisers with an armoured deck protecting their engines, or simply no armour at all.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{existing}} fortifications in this location. The main existing fort, King Charles's Castle, had <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1550s but was poorly sited {{and had been}} blown up by its defenders when Blake's forces took the island. There was also a small blockhouse beneath it, dating from the 16th century, and the new castle was built {{on top of this}} preexisting site.|$|E
50|$|Santa Maria Manuela <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CUF shipyards at Lisbon in 1937, as a lugre bacalhoeiro (codfish fishing lugger). <b>The</b> similar Creoula <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same shipyards at {{the same}} time. Another similar and still {{existent}} ship, Argus <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> 1938 by <b>the</b> shipyard De Haan & Oerlemans, Heusden, Holland.|$|R
50|$|It <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{second half}} of the 15th century and the 16th century. It was {{designed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Renaissance architectural style. <b>The</b> chapel <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 16th century and <b>the</b> dovecote <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th century.|$|R
50|$|An Orthodox church {{called the}} Church of <b>the</b> Nativity <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century {{but it has}} now fallen into ruin.A schoolhouse <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village <b>in</b> 1936 and it functioned as a school until 1988.|$|R
