25|$|Entry {{into the}} cockpit and {{passenger}} cabin were from the upper surface of the wing center section. Access was through <b>bi-fold</b> doors latched at the bottom. Both doors were equipped with a center hinge allowing the doors, when opened, to lay folded onto the upper surface of the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|A {{bifold door}} is {{a unit that}} has several sections, folding in pairs. Wood {{is the most common}} material, and doors may also be metal or glass. Bifolds are most {{commonly}} made for closets, but may also be used as units between rooms. <b>Bi-fold</b> doors are essentially now doors that let the outside in. They open in concert; where the panels fold up against one another and are pushed together when opened. The main door panel (often known as the traffic door) is accompanied by a stack of panels that fold very neatly against one another when opened fully, which almost look like room dividers.|$|E
2500|$|Aft of the nav {{station on}} the port side {{at the base of the}} {{companionway}} is the head. A louvered teak <b>bi-fold</b> door provides access to the space. Built as a complete molded head unit with full headroom and good ventilation, it includes a vanity sink, marine head, an abundance of mirrored storage cabinets, and a large separate stall shower with a Plexiglas door and dividing partition. [...] Hot and cold pressurized water system and electric shower sump pump complete the systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{conversion}} {{was enacted}} by Grizzly Engineering of Swan Hill during 1996. The modifications included {{the removal of}} the fixed side louvre panels and doors, the fitting of two internal bulkheads, 3 pairs of external <b>bi-folding</b> doors and repainting into V/Line Freight colours. VFBX 1 saw very little use, and by August 2000 the body had been removed and the underframe converted to flat-wagon VFTX 28.|$|R
25|$|Doors: The doors themselves, at first, were {{essentially}} the same. However, Muni's cars had moveable steps, {{which could be}} lowered for street-level boarding or raised for boarding from high-level platforms, {{such as those in}} the subway. The Boston cars did not have this feature and so must be boarded from street-level. These doors proved troublesome and the MBTA eventually replaced them with <b>bi-folding</b> doors, further distinguishing them from Muni's.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, louvre wagon VLEX949 was {{modified}} in Swan Hill by Grizzly Engineering. The sides were removed and two internal bulkheads were added, with the now three compartments made accessible with {{three pairs of}} external <b>bi-folding</b> doors. The new wagon, VBFX1, was painted into V/Line Freight colours. The new van was not used regularly, and by August 2000 the body had been removed and the underframe converted to flat wagon VFTX 28.|$|R
2500|$|The LRVs came {{equipped}} with overly complex [...] "plug doors," [...] which were originally {{intended for the}} high-platform operation in the Muni Metro subway. These doors would frequently short circuit and caused a significant nuisance for the MBTA. The transit agency later attempted to correct the issues with the plug doors by adding a wider rubber strip and eliminating the recycling circuit, but the issue was not fully resolved until the mid-1990s, when MBTA retrofitted all Boeings with much more reliable <b>bi-fold</b> doors.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} types of single-sheet {{brochures}} are the <b>bi-fold</b> (a single sheet printed {{on both sides}} and folded into halves) and the tri-fold (the same, but folded into thirds). A <b>bi-fold</b> brochure results in four panels (two panels on each side), while a tri-fold results in six panels (three panels on each side).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bi-fold</b> wallet: {{a type of}} wallet {{in which}} the {{banknotes}} are folded over once. Credit cards and identification cards may be stored horizontally or vertically.|$|E
50|$|The {{south-eastern}} piazza {{is reached}} through timber-framed, glazed French doors from the south-eastern rooms. The piazza floor is colourful, tessellated tiles on a suspended concrete slab. Two murals depicting bucolic scenes are {{painted on the}} piazza walls. At {{the northern end of}} the bedroom wing is the enclosed piazza. Its floor is recent ceramic tiles that are not of cultural heritage significance. Doors into this room are original French doors, re-fashioned to be <b>bi-folding.</b>|$|R
50|$|Built in 1921 the {{building}} originally {{served as a}} Crissy Field airplane hangar, which helped launch De Havilland DH-48 biplanes {{as part of the}} United States Army 91st Observation Squadron. Later it was used as a motor vehicle paint shop and office and storage space for the Army and is a contributing feature to the park's National Historic Landmark status. The hangar was redesigned by San Francisco architect, Mark Horton, and features 42 ft wide by 20 ft tall <b>bi-folding</b> glass hangar door and a second story catwalk overlooking the trampoline structures. Historic photography of {{the building}} and the surrounding Presidio are showcased in a 35 ft display wall at the entrance of the building.|$|R
50|$|The {{remainder}} of the building is timber framed and lined. Exterior walls are single skin with externally exposed stud framing lined internally with boards detailed with double beading. Internal partitions are also single skin with stop-chamfered studs and these, together with the ceiling, are lined with single-beaded tongue and groove boards. The rooms are generally without cornices except the 1901 addition which has a timber cove. Some joinery is painted, including four-panelled doors, French doors to the exterior and double hung windows. That which is clear finished includes cedar windows in the north-west (front) and south-east (rear) walls of the 1901 addition and the architraves, reveals and fanlights of the large <b>bi-folding</b> door opening.|$|R
50|$|Isolated in {{a central}} terrain, the simple sports {{pavilion}} consists of a single large nave, for social and sporting events, with annexes for storage, washrooms and change rooms, stage and projection booth. There are five exits through <b>bi-fold</b> doors, with one in the changing area.|$|E
5000|$|The modern <b>bi-fold</b> wallet with {{multiple}} [...] "card slots" [...] became standardized {{in the early}} 1950s {{with the introduction of}} the first credit cards. Some innovations include the introduction of the velcro-closure wallet in the 1970s. Pocket-sized wallets remain extremely popular to this day.|$|E
50|$|Brick stairs {{lead up to}} the {{recessed}} entrance. The lawn is {{ramped up}} to the <b>bi-fold</b> doors of the living room. At {{the rear of the}} house a raised semi-enclosed, covered patio area opens onto an informal garden area. The garden is enclosed with pool fencing.|$|E
50|$|Compared to its predecessor, the Siemens-Duewag U2, the SD-160's driver's {{cabin is}} {{significantly}} larger, but its total length is still less than 25 m, allowing three vehicles {{to be combined}} and still be under the 75 m maximum length of a German streetcar train assembly. Each vehicle also features an onboard closed-circuit TV security camera system for increased passenger safety. Unlike the Siemens SD-100, the Siemens SD-160 does not use the <b>bi-folded</b> doors, instead using sliding doors similar to designs featured on the Siemens S70. In addition, both can be used together in mixed trains consisting of SD-100s and SD-160s. The new, streetcar-length S70 cars ordered for San Diego {{are designed to be}} compatible with the SD-100, allowing the SD-100 to operate in a mixed consist, sandwiched between two S70 cars.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} design of an all-reflective, <b>bi-folded</b> Schmidt {{telescope}} aimed at surveys of extended astronomical objects with extremely-low surface brightness. The design leads to a high image quality without any diffracting spider, along with a large aperture and field of view, with a small central obstruction which barely alters the PSF. As an example, we present {{the design of}} a high-quality, 36 cm diameter, fast (f / 2. 5) telescope working in the visible with a large field of view (1. 6 x 2. 6). The telescope can operate with a curved detector (or with a flat detector with a field flattener) and a set of filters. The entrance mirror is anamorphic and replaces the classical Schmidt entrance corrector plate. We show that this anamorphic primary mirror can be manufactured through stress polishing, avoiding high spatial frequency errors, and tested with a simple interferometer scheme. This prototype is intended to serve as a fast-track scientific and technological pathfinder for the future space-based MESSIER mission. Comment: 10 pages, 10 figures, 2 table...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{layout of}} the building is clearly discernible. Approached from the footpath, the centred main entrance opens from the arcade into the spacious banking chamber. The manager's office and accountant's alcove are located to the left along its eastern side and strong room, toilet and stationery room along the rear to the south. A door {{in the rear of}} the western wall leads out to the lane. The dining room is located in the south-east corner. Adjacent, at rear of the bank, is an impressive stair hall which provides separate external access to the first floor manager's apartment together with through access from the service wing to the dining room. There is a storage room under the stair and linen store on the first floor. Opening off the stair hall, the apartment has an L-shaped hall leading to the western verandah where there are bathrooms clad with chamferboards located on the south-western corner. Two large principal rooms across the front (originally the drawing room and principal bedroom) and four smaller rooms (dressing room and three bedrooms) toward the rear open off the hall. The former, connected by <b>bi-folding</b> doors, have substantial joinery and all rooms opening onto the front and side verandahs have French doors.|$|R
50|$|Entry {{into the}} cockpit and {{passenger}} cabin were from the upper surface of the wing center section. Access was through <b>bi-fold</b> doors latched at the bottom. Both doors were equipped with a center hinge allowing the doors, when opened, to lay folded onto the upper surface of the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|Beginning with 2011, the Prevost X3-45 is {{available}} in a transit configuration, with <b>bi-fold</b> doors instead of a sedan-type door. The New York City Transit Authority is the launch customer for this configuration. Previously, 20 transit-style buses in the LeMirage predecessor model had been built for GO Transit in the late 1990s.|$|E

5000|$|The {{external}} walls are orange face brick laid in English bond with projecting headers creating a repetitive pattern and texture-the {{lower part of}} the walls are without projecting bricks and are painted. Projecting bricks form large Christograms on the side walls of the tower - [...] "ihs" [...] on the east and [...] "xp" [...] on the west. The east and west walls of the body of the church are divided into six bays by full height recesses containing copper rainwater downpipes with detailed copper heads and straps. The bays each have a fixed, steel framed glazing to full height above a double-leaf, glazed, timber framed door. An architrave of projecting headers defines the openings. Beyond the southern-most bay the chancel is lit by fixed, steel framed glazing with deep reveals. The vestries project beneath these windows. The rear wall is windowless and has a field of projecting headers with a large central cross formed by projecting bricks. The vestry walls do not have projecting bricks and are rendered and painted.The church entrance is a simple, open, painted concrete portico. Above the portico the north elevation of the tower is treated to suggest an open bible with raised, white cement rendered letters two feet high on dark grey textured concrete pages reading:GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, THAT WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM SHOULD NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE. JOHN III.16andBELOVED IF GOD SO LOVED US, WE OUGHT ALSO TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER, IF WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER. GOD DWELLETH IN US AND HIS LOVE IS PERFECTED IN US. 1. JOHN IV,11-12The portico floor is unpainted concrete and on the painted and rendered portico walls are two circular panels of mosaics approximately 1m in diameter. One depicts St John's eagle and the other Luther's Seal. Two sandstone plaques are fixed to the wall, which read:IN MEMORY OF EMILIE LOVGREEN WHOSE GENEROUS GIFT MADE THIS TOWER POSSIBLE. [...] "THANKS BE TO GOD."andTHIS STONE WAS LAID ON 24TH MAY 1958 BY PASTOR F.H. SCHMIDT, PRESIDENT, U.E.L.C.A. QLD. DIST. [...] "UNTO GOD BE GLORY IN THE CHURCH BY CHRIST JESUS THROUGHOUT ALL AGES, WORLD WITHOUT END. AMEN" [...] EPH. 3, 21.The portico opens into an entry vestibule through large, <b>bi-folding,</b> steel gates embellished with the notation [...] "1960". The vestibule has a low ceiling of stained and varnished timber battens and a floor of grey vinyl tiles with contrasting white tiles in a cross shape in two places. Within the vestibule are three steps up onto the level of the nave.|$|R
50|$|Optional Component Scheme (OCS) - More {{flexibility}} and choices to have floor finishes and internal timber doors installed. The opt-in basic cost are usually about 20~30% cheaper due to bulk purchases and less labour charges. But {{those who want}} variety of timber or <b>bi-fold</b> doors design, and better homogeneous/porcelain tiles or tiles/timber skirting can {{opt out of the}} schemes.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} {{section of}} the house is divided into two large rooms by a timber <b>bi-fold</b> door. The ceiling is coved and lined with tongue-and- groove timber boards. A long timber beam supported by timber posts supports the change in pitch of the roof. The single fireplace has a timber mantel and the wall it opens out of appears to be plastered.|$|E
5000|$|Not {{long after}} publication, {{the story was}} adapted for an album issued by RCA Victor (Y-339). Narrated by Paul Wing, the audio {{adaptation}} had a running time of 13 minutes and 37 seconds. The dramatization featured music and sound effects on two 10" [...] 78rpm records in a <b>bi-fold</b> sleeve. This recording was played in elementary school classrooms during the early 1940s.|$|E
50|$|The first {{purpose-built}} ambulance {{building for}} Queensland {{was constructed in}} 1897 in Wharf Street, Brisbane. This building established the precedent for subsequent ambulance station designs. The design incorporated a two-storeyed building housing plant and staff facilities at ground level and a residence on the upper level. Large ground floor openings with <b>bi-fold</b> doors allowed ready access directly to the street for quick exit of horse and sulky.|$|E
5000|$|From the Arab Israeli {{conflict}} the United Nations inaugurated the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), {{this became}} the premier UN peacekeeping {{organization in the}} Middle East. It was clearly given a <b>bi-fold</b> mission which reads as follows: [...] "first, to observe and report on the truce which was established on June 18, 1948, and, secondly, to maintain {{the organization of the}} Mixed Armistice Commissions (MAC).|$|E
50|$|Internally, {{inside the}} {{entrance}} {{there is a}} centrally placed 3-sided ticket booth. To the south side is a store room, and to the north a staircase {{to the first floor}} bio-box. The auditorium is accessed through 2 pairs of <b>bi-fold</b> doors either side of the ticket booth. There are also 3 single doors in the western wall providing access to the ticket box, a store room and the staircase. The bio-box window has been in-filled.|$|E
50|$|Orchards {{also served}} as sites for food {{production}} and as arenas for manual labor, and cemetery orchards, such as that detailed in the plan for St. Gall, showed yet more versatility. The cemetery orchard not only produced fruit, but manifested as a natural symbol of the garden of Paradise. This <b>bi-fold</b> concept of the garden as a space that met both physical and spiritual needs was carried over to the cloister garth.|$|E
50|$|The Newark Targum is {{a weekly}} student {{newspaper}} {{published by the}} TargumPublishing Company for the student population of the Newark campus of Rutgers University. It is a weekly paper, with a circulation of 5,000 copies, printed each Wednesday during the academic year. It exists as a <b>bi-fold</b> tabloid-sized newspaper, similar to the Daily Targum the daily newspaper at Rutgers University published since 1869 on the universitys main campus in New Brunswick, New Jersey.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Warner Bros. LP 1830 {{included an}} 8.5" [...] X 11" [...] <b>bi-fold</b> insert with Celtic symbols and lyrics for [...] "Saint Stephen", [...] "The Eleven", and [...] "Dark Star". The tracks {{are presented as}} one continuous concert. As such, vinyl copies are pressed with automatic sequencing, for stacking on a record changer (Record One containing Sides 1/4 and Record Two containing sides 2/3). CD versions present the track segues without interruption.|$|E
5000|$|USNS Guam {{was built}} as Huakai, {{whose name is}} based on the Hawaiian {{language}} word huakai, which means [...] "journey". The vessel is a 373 ft long high-speed roll-on/roll-off (Ro/Ro) passenger ship. The vessel was originally built for Hawaii Superferry, and has a capacity of 866 passengers and up to 282 subcompact cars. It is 19 ft longer than its sister ship, , due to a <b>bi-fold</b> ramp installed on the stern of the ship.|$|E
