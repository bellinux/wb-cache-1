In his opening speech Gairdner stated that [...] "The public must {{learn that the}} {{handicapped}} person is not an invalid. I am handicapped, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I loathe is for people to treat me as an invalid. We, the public, must realise {{what can be done}} to rehabilitate people who have suffered a grevious physical disadvantage".|$|E
500|$|Andrew Taylor, {{director}} of the animal rights group Animal Aid, called for an outright ban of the Grand National, saying: [...] "It's a deliberately hazardous, challenging and predictably lethal event." [...] The RSPCA's equine consultant David Muir stated: [...] "I was gutted that two horses died... What I will do now is go back {{and have a look}} at each element, with the BHA and the racecourse management, to see if the jump contributed to what happened, look at the take-off and landing side and so on, and see if the evidence suggests something can be done about it. I'm trying to make the race better, safer where I can, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I can never do is eliminate risk: that's always going to be there." [...] Muir did however add: [...] "There's no way I'm going to get the National banned." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Perry is {{depicted}} as having suicidal thoughts and {{lying on the floor}} of a bathroom. The song opens with only piano and Perry's vocals, while she sings [...] "Was twenty-seven, surviving my return from Saturn", and as the song carries on, she finds her strength, singing [...] "By the grace of God / I picked myself back up / I put one foot in front of the other and I / Looked in the mirror and decided to stay / Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way". Perry commented on the lyrics: [...] " [...] are very exact and autobiographical. That's how I write. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> about those lyrics is you can hear me finding my strength throughout the song. It starts off really low and then I kind of stand up for myself and say, 'No!'." [...] The song also sees Perry rejecting the idea that the relationship ended because of her.|$|E

He is perhaps five hundred miles off, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> fear {{of him is}} on all of them, like the finger of God.

2500|$|On March 26, 2010, Schoeneweis {{signed a}} minor league {{contract}} with a spring training invitation with the Boston Red Sox. [...] In 15 games and 31 innings at Fenway Park in his career, he had a 2.59 ERA, with a [...]168 batting average against and [...]224 slugging percentage against. [...] According to Red Sox pitching coach John Farrell, {{one of the main}} factors in the competition for the final two roster spots in the bullpen was [...] "being able to match up left on left". [...] Red Sox manager Terry Francona said: [...] "I haven't even seen Schoeneweis yet, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> he's been able to do is get left-handers out." [...] According to a team source, he was to make $500,000 if he were to make the team.|$|E
2500|$|Hollywood in 1951 was {{the feeding}} {{ground for the}} House Un-American Activities Committee, the House's rabid anti-communist {{investigations}} pitted Hollywood's residents against one another. [...] If you testified you were a [...] "friendly" [...] witness, if you were named a communist sympathizer you were [...] "blacklisted", either way your side was chosen for you. [...] The couple were preparing to leave for Europe, as Igee was negotiating a French remake of Three Husbands, when MGM abruptly and illegally questioned Caspary regarding her Communist links. They were duly worried, as they had just bought two expensive stories from her, and if she were named and blacklisted {{they would not be}} able to release them. In 1950, Caspary and her former activities had been listed along with other influential progressives in the notorious anti-communist pamphlet, [...] Since Caspary had left the Party before she came to Hollywood, she told the truth about which committees she attended and the initiatives she had worked on, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> they never asked was if she had ever been a member.|$|E

6000|$|MRS GEORGE. Hm! Like most men, {{you think}} you know {{everything}} a woman wants, dont you? <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>one</b> wants most {{has nothing to do with}} marriage at all. Perhaps Anthony here has a glimmering of it. Eh, Anthony? ...|$|R
6000|$|Ruth laughed. [...] "Oh, well, {{when you}} {{speculate}} at the Board of Trade, a railroad engineer {{is not a}} useful friend. I suppose I ought to stay, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>one</b> ought to do are tiresome. Let's go on the lake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you're wrong again, though I {{might have}} been taken in {{as well as you}} <b>but</b> for <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I spoke of. Three days ago Ballingall had a ghost of a chance of pulling through, I thought, and I told the lassie that if he did, the credit would be mainly hers. You'll {{scarcely}} believe it, but, upon my word, she looked disappointed rather than pleased, and she said to me, quite reproachfully, 'You told me he was sure to die!' What do you make of that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anything <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that I {{have sworn}} not to do." [...] For {{he had told}} the priest of the {{promises}} he had made both to his uncle and to his uncle's widow.|$|E

60|$|As I {{walked back}} to Madame Bouvet's I {{made up my mind}} that there was <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to do, to go at once to Monsieur de Saint-Gre's plantation. Finding Madame still waiting in the gallery, I asked her to direct me thither.|$|E
50|$|Outlaw Skuzz (Alan Oppenheimer): Tex's cigar-smoking henchman. A {{cousin of}} Deputy Fuzz; {{apparently}} the only Prairie Person to practice crime.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} in 2012, Watson admitted that he was [...] "distraught" [...] at coming so close to becoming the oldest Major winner {{at the age of}} 59 and said that the experience in the 2009 British Open [...] "tore his guts out". Watson said of his approach shot to the green at the 72nd hole, when he needed a par to win the Open: [...] "I was going right at <b>the</b> flag <b>but</b> with <b>the</b> uncertainty of links golf, maybe a gust of wind took it a bit further than it was supposed to. I felt extreme disappointment that night <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> good <b>thing</b> that came of that was the response of people around the world." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{is not for}} the historian--especially for a {{civilian}} historian--to say a word unnecessarily to aggravate the pain of that brave man who, having done all that personal courage could do, was seen afterwards sobbing on the table of the waiting-room at Molteno, and bewailing his 'poor men.' He had a disaster, but Nelson had one at Teneriffe and Napoleon at Acre, and built their great reputations in spite of it. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> good <b>thing</b> of a disaster is that by examining it we may learn to do better in the future, and so it would indeed be a perilous thing if we agreed that our reverses were not a fit subject for open and frank discussion.|$|R
6000|$|... "You take a {{pleasure}} to torment me," [...] said I, [...] "and I make a very feckless plaything; {{but let me ask}} you to be more merciful. At this time there is <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that I care to hear of, and that will be news of Catriona." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was unknown}} that four hundred {{men of the}} West African Regiment, with nearly twenty officers, and a company from Jebba {{were on their way}} to {{reinforce}} them. Three officers were away to raise native levies in Denkera and Akim, and there were rumours about more troops from other parts of the world. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> certain was that some more troops were coming down from Northern Nigeria.|$|E

50|$|Sheung Ying Hung didn't respect Yi Long San: {{she saw him}} as a poor {{match for}} her daughter, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> couple refused to listen and decided to marry with or without Sheung Ying Hung's permission. Out of pride, Sheung Ying Hung refused to attend the couple's {{marriage}} and ignored the couple until Ding Yum died. Ding Yum had a heart condition that she kept from everyone. She wanted to grant Yi Long San's wish of having a child together, which cost her life. Sheung Ying Hung would blame Yi Long San for Dim Yum's death {{for many years to}} come, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> redeeming <b>thing</b> they could salvage out of this tragedy was the child, Michel Chong Man Sai (Tong Chi Fai).|$|R
60|$|In those weeks, Colberg Siege, Pitt's Catastrophe {{and high}} things are impending, or completed, elsewhere: <b>but</b> this is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{noticeable}} hereabouts. In regard to Strehlen, and Friedrich's history there, {{what we have}} to say turns all upon this Kappel and Warkotsch: and,--after mentioning only that Friedrich's lodging is not in Strehlen proper, but in Woiselwitz, a village or suburb almost half a mile off, and very negligently guarded,--we have to record an Adventure which then made a great deal of noise in the world.|$|R
2500|$|Based {{upon her}} work in the United States, Adler found that the pagan {{movement}} was [...] "very diverse" [...] in its class and ethnic background. She went on to remark that she had encountered pagans in jobs that ranged from [...] "fireman to PhD chemist" [...] <b>but</b> that <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that she thought made them into an [...] "elite" [...] was as avid readers, something that she found to be very common within the pagan community {{despite the fact that}} avid readers constituted less than 20% of the general population of the United States at the time. Magliocco came to a somewhat different conclusion based upon her ethnographic research of pagans in California, remarking that the majority were [...] "white, middle-class, well-educated urbanites" [...] but that they were united in finding [...] "artistic inspiration" [...] within [...] "folk and indigenous spiritual traditions".|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} {{he was about to}} become conciliatory. Then the {{recollection}} of the girl's panic and her hints at some trouble which threatened her--presumably through the medium of this man, brother or no brother--checked him. He did not know what it was all about, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that did stand out clearly in the welter of confused happenings was the girl's need for his assistance. Whatever might be the rights of the case, he was her accomplice, and must behave as such.|$|E
60|$|His {{complexion}} was {{pink and}} white, {{his hands were}} as soft as {{the hands of his}} daughters, and he weighed a hundred and twelve pounds. Moreover, he was afraid of his wife, afraid of a policeman, afraid of physical violence, and lived in constant dread of burglars. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> he was not afraid of was wild animals of the most ferocious sorts, such as lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars. He knew the game, and could conquer the most refractory lion with a broom-handle--not outside the cage, but inside and locked in.|$|E
60|$|As a revolutionist myself, as one on {{the inside}} who knew the hopes and fears and secret plans of the revolutionists, I am fitted to answer, as very few are, the charge that they were guilty of {{exploding}} the bomb in Congress. And I can say flatly, without qualification or doubt of any sort, that the socialists, in Congress and out, had no hand in the affair. Who threw the bomb we do not know, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> we are absolutely sure of is {{that we did not}} throw it.|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{year there}} arrived a young English engineer, {{who had come}} out to superintend some canal works. He brought with him {{satisfactory}} letters of recommendation, and was at once received by the European residents as a welcome addition to their social circle. He was not particularly good- looking, he was not remarkably charming, <b>but</b> he possessed <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that few women can resist in a man, and that is strength. The woman looked at the man, and the man {{looked back at the}} woman; and the drama began.|$|R
60|$|And one may {{picture to}} one's self how harmoniously the holy cursing of the Puritan {{of that day}} would have chimed in with the unholy cursing and the {{crackling}} wit of the Rochesters and Sedleys, and with the revilings of the political fanatics, if my imaginary plain dealer {{had gone on to}} say that, if the return of such misfortunes were ever rendered impossible, it would not be in virtue of the victory of the faith of Laud, or of that of Milton; and, as little, by the triumph of republicanism, as by that of monarchy. <b>But</b> that <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> needful for compassing this end was, that the people of England should second the effort of an insignificant corporation, the establishment of which, a few years before the epoch of the great plague and the great fire, had been as little noticed, as they were conspicuous.|$|R

The folks who run the website wanted to change directions. That direction didn't include the creation of original content. So my job description was changed. And since what I do best (well, other than play games, eat pizza, and lay on the couch and do nothing) is create content, it clearly was no longer the best fit for me. So I'm out." ...|$|R
60|$|While {{the rest}} talked, {{she had been}} working, for every hour showed her that her {{instinct}} had been a true one and pride would not let her stay, though love pleaded eloquently. So, after a Christmas anything but merry, Phebe packed her trunks, rich in gifts from those who generously gave her all <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> she desired, and, with a pocketful of letters to people who could further her plans, she went away to seek her fortune, with a brave face and a very heavy heart.|$|E
6000|$|Frank, of course, {{ran through}} all his arguments. He {{would go into}} a profession, or take a farm and live in it. He would wait; that is, for a few months. [...] "A few months, Frank!" [...] said Mary. [...] "Well, perhaps six." [...] "Oh, Frank!" [...] But Frank would not be stopped. He would do {{anything}} that his father might ask him. Anything <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> He would not give up the wife he had chosen.

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{that nobody}} {{is allowed to}} do in Mariposa is to have no politics. Of course there are always some people whose {{circumstances}} compel them {{to say that they}} have no politics. But that is easily understood. Take the case of Trelawney, the postmaster. Long ago he was a letter carrier under the old Mackenzie Government, and later he was a letter sorter under the old Macdonald Government, and after that a letter stamper under the old Tupper Government, and so on. Trelawney always says that he has no politics, {{but the truth is that}} he has too many.|$|E
60|$|Sheldon noticed, too, the way Tudor {{looked at}} her and {{followed}} her about with his eyes, and in those eyes he noted a certain hungry look, and on the face a certain wistful expression; and he wondered if on his own face he carried a similar involuntary advertisement. He was sure of several things: first, that Tudor was not the right man for Joan and could not possibly make her permanently happy; next, that Joan was too sensible a girl really {{to fall in love with}} a man of such superficial stamp; and, finally, that Tudor would blunder his love-making somehow. And at the same time, with true lover's anxiety, Sheldon feared that the other might somehow fail to blunder, and win the girl with purely fortuitous and successful meretricious show. <b>But</b> of <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> Sheldon was sure: Tudor had no intimate knowledge of her and was unaware of how vital in her was her wildness and love of independence. That was where he would blunder--in the catching and the holding of her. And then, in spite of all his certitude, Sheldon could not forbear wondering if his theories of Joan might not be wrong, and if Tudor was not going the right way about after all.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{through the}} intense silence, {{he heard the}} whicker of a horse. The sound came {{from the side of}} the track toward the east, and Chicken began to explore timorously in that direction. He stepped high along the mat of curly mesquit grass, for he was afraid of {{everything}} there might be in this wilderness--snakes, rats, brigands, centipedes, mirages, cowboys, fandangoes, tarantulas, tamales--he had read of them in the story papers. Rounding a clump of prickly pear that reared high its fantastic and menacing array of rounded heads, he was struck to shivering terror by a snort and a thunderous plunge, as the horse, himself startled, bounded away some fifty yards, and then resumed his grazing. <b>But</b> here was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> in <b>the</b> desert that Chicken did not fear. He had been reared on a farm; he had handled horses, understood them, and could ride.|$|R
