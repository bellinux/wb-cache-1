5|$|Meanwhile, at {{the office}}, {{half of the}} office opts to stay behind. Robert California (James Spader) makes a {{spontaneous}} visit and asks them {{to come up with}} Dunder Mifflin/Sabre's next <b>big</b> <b>idea.</b> However, the office fails to impress Robert with their ideas. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) details an idea he has about cookie placement in the vending machine, but Robert gets the impression that he is extremely clever and is speaking only in metaphors. Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who has been annoyed the entire day with Kevin being creative and Robert rejecting his ideas, later tricks Kevin into explaining an idea he has involving the Big Mac, and Robert realizes that there was no subtext to Kevin's ideas.|$|E

25|$|On September 16, 2006, Telemundo debuted {{a weekend}} morning block aimed at younger {{children}} {{as part of}} the Qubo endeavor, which was formed through a partnership between NBC Universal, Ion Media Networks, Teletoon, Nelvana, Scholastic Media, Classic Media and its subsidiary <b>Big</b> <b>Idea</b> Productions. It felt a little bit similar to the Telemundo Kids block since Jacob Two-Two also aired on the Qubo block. The Qubo block featured Spanish dubs of programs seen on its companion blocks on NBC, Ion Television, and its companion 24/7 network (alternatively known as Qubo Channel), with Telemundo's Qubo block airing on Saturday and Sunday mornings in 90-minute blocks.|$|E
25|$|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) signed Healy and his Stooges {{to a movie}} {{contract}} in 1933. They appeared in feature films and short subjects, either together, individually, or with various combinations of actors. The trio was featured {{in a series of}} musical comedy shorts, beginning with Nertsery Rhymes. The short was one of a few shorts to be made with an early two-strip Technicolor process, including one featuring Curly without Healy or the other Stooges, Roast Beef and Movies (1934). The shorts themselves were built around recycled film footage of production numbers cut from MGM musicals, such as Children of Pleasure, Lord Byron of Broadway and the unfinished March of Time (all 1930), which had been filmed in early Technicolor. Soon, additional shorts followed (sans the experimental Technicolor), including Beer and Pretzels (1933), Plane Nuts (1933), Jail Birds of Paradise (1934) and The <b>Big</b> <b>Idea</b> (1934).|$|E

500|$|Lillywhite {{believed}} that the African influences had not translated well onto the album, remarking: [...] "It's a pity because {{the whole idea of}} Morocco as a <b>big</b> <b>idea</b> was great. When the <b>big</b> <b>idea</b> for U2 is good, that is when they succeed the most, but I don't think the spirit of what they set out to achieve was translated. Something happened that meant it did not come across on the record." [...] The Edge concurred, admitting that the group erred by [...] "starting out experimental and then trying to bring it into something that was more accessible". He added, [...] "I think probably we should have said, 'It's an experimental work. That's what it is.'" [...] Mullen refers to the album as [...] "No Craic on the Horizon" [...] and said, [...] "It was pretty fucking miserable. It turns out that we're not as good as we thought we were and things got in the way." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark A. Altman {{reviewed}} the episode for the 1998 book Trek Navigator stating it was [...] "one big, inferior rip-off of [...] ""." [...] James Hunt {{wrote about the}} episode in October 2012 for the website Den of Geek. He thought it worked [...] "surprisingly well" [...] and that the ending was [...] "Star Trek at its best - <b>big</b> <b>idea</b> philosophical nonsense". He praised the plot twists {{and said that the}} Ferengi [...] "while completely ridiculous, are genuinely hilarious". Zack Handlen watched the episode for The A.V. Club in April 2010. He described the Ferengi as [...] "really, really terrible", and said that Portal was a lazy device reminiscent of such god-like beings in The Original Series. He gave the episode a grade of C-.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Morse portrayed George Washington in the HBO miniseries John Adams, {{for which}} {{his nose was}} made bigger. Morse commented: [...] "The first {{thing that comes to}} mind is my nose; it was my <b>big</b> <b>idea</b> to do that nose. We didn't have a lot of time, because they asked me to do this about three weeks before they started shooting, and I just kept looking at these portraits and {{thinking}} 'this man's face is so commanding'. And I did not feel that my face was very commanding in the way his was. So I convinced them that we should try the nose, and we tried it on, and everybody went 'wow, that's Washington'." [...] Morse's portrayal earned him his second Emmy Award nomination. He is currently reprising the role of Washington in voice form as part of The Hall of Presidents show in Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with a B, explaining {{that while he}} thought it was [...] "much more fun" [...] than the previous week's episode and enjoyed Peter's expanded presence, he was growing slightly wearied by the [...] "hint-dropping" [...] of Peter's past. Murray thought the climax was [...] "so exciting" [...] that he was willing [...] "to forgive {{the fact that this is}} the third week in a row that Walter's <b>big</b> <b>idea</b> has involved some kind of communication with the unconscious". IGN's Travis Fickett rated it 7.5/10, writing that {{he thought it was}} a solid episode because the [...] "characters are coming together nicely, the story is better than last week's – but already it seems the show is hitting a formula". Fickett expressed worriment that Fringe would eventually become too formulaic, much like the first season of Smallville, and concluded his review by calling Fringe [...] "a solid show, but [...] exceptional yet".|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{the mythology}} for season seven was {{supposed}} to continue from and show the ramifications of the [...] "Two Fathers"/"One Son" [...] story arc. Frank Spotnitz, in an interview, explained that the mythology episodes for season seven would feature [...] "characters you saw in 'One Son' coming back" [...] and explore [...] "what happens now that the conspiracy has been destroyed, what are {{the politics of the}} new landscape that exists. [...] There are aliens from outer space, two different races that are warring with each other." [...] In addition, he said that the then-planned series finale would feature [...] "the <b>big</b> <b>idea</b> that Chris [...] had in the beginning." [...] However, these ideas never came to pass, and the season finale, [...] "Requiem", segued directly into the eighth season premiere [...] "Within". Duchovny later revealed that, had the show ended, the final three episodes would have been devoted to the myth-arc.|$|E
500|$|Developers {{originally}} intended for players to be permanently {{out of a}} race when falling far off a track, however they {{came to realize that}} it was not fun for players [...] "to be forced to go slow or suffer an instant defeat." [...] An attempt was made to give three [...] "strikes" [...] to a rider. [...] Once the rider fell for the third time they were out of the race. [...] However once implemented developers noticed that the number of racers remaining {{at the end of the}} race was too random to be deemed any fun. [...] In the end the decision was made to simply respawn the character on the track. The PC version was ported in large part by John Olsen, who worked on the port as his first task at SingleTrac. [...] The PC version also features 3Dfx hardware acceleration, which allows for higher resolution gameplay and visual enhancements such as reflective water. [...] Axiom Design created the user interface shell for the game, which has a comic book-inspired feel. The music for Jet Moto was produced by <b>Big</b> <b>Idea</b> Music Productions.|$|E
