The purpose of the study is to substantiate the structure of direct and indirect damage and to develop an adequate technique for the quantitative assessment of a full damage caused by the interrupt <b>in</b> electrical <b>supply</b> of various groups of industrial consumers. The analysis of domestic and foreign methodological approaches to the assessment of the damage caused by <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> an electrical <b>supply</b> allowed to substantiate the structure of a full damage. For this purpose, we propose three groups of techniques. The first method is based on the standard approach. We apply it for a detailed account of the components of damage (real loss, social and economic losses, ecological damage, indirect losses) with reference to the occurred failure. The second technique is based on the use of three groups of typical scenarios of the consequences of an emergency interruption <b>in</b> power <b>supply.</b> These scenarios have resulted from the analysis of the regulation documentation and statistical data on the basic groups of industrial consumers (on the example of gas supply system, these are production facilities, transport, storage, reprocessing and support facilities). The third method is based on the specific indicators of unplanned coasts depending on the size of the disconnected capacity, an interruption duration and the duration of the restoration of electricity. The second and third techniques are developed to forecast the damage and to substantiate the efficiency of measures for improving the reliability of the electrical supply of the industrial consumers. The article includes the results of the assessment of full damage caused by the interruption <b>in</b> the electrical <b>supply</b> through the developed techniques on the example of the gas industry objects. The comparison of the results of the assessment with the real values of damages from the occurred failures would suggest the adequacy of the developed techniques. The appropriate account of the economic damage caused by <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> the electrical <b>supply</b> would substantiate the measures making energy supplies for the safe and reliable.

40|$|The Social Security {{earnings}} test, {{a version}} of which still applies to those ages 62 - 64, reduces immediate payments to beneficiaries whose labor income exceeds a given threshold. Although benefits are subsequently increased to compensate for any such reduction, the earnings test is typically perceived as a tax on working. As a result, it {{is considered by many}} to be an important disincentive to paid work for older Americans. Yet there is little evidence to suggest an economically significant effect of the earnings test on hours of work, and almost no research on the effect of the test on the decision to work at all. We investigate these issues using the significant changes in the structure of the earnings test over the past 25 years, using data over the past 25 years, using data over the 1973 - 1998 period from the March Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS), which provide large samples of observations on the elderly. Our analysis suggests two major conclusions. First, the earnings test exerts no robust influence on the labor supply decisions of men. Neither graphical analyses of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> labor <b>supply</b> trends, nor regression estimates that control for underlying trends <b>in</b> labor <b>supply</b> by age group, reveal any significant impact of changes in earnings test parameters on aggregate employment, hours of work, or earnings for men. For women, there is more suggestive evidence that the earnings test is affecting labor supply decisions. Second, loosening the earnings test appears to accelerate benefits receipt among the eligible population, lowering benefits levels, and heightening concerns about the standard of living of these elderly at very advanced ages. Our findings suggest some cause for caution before rushing to remove the earnings test at younger ages. ...|$|R

5000|$|Being {{much shorter}} than the {{predominant}} multiple units, electric locomotives can suffer from a problem known as [...] "gapping" [...] - becoming marooned between <b>supplies</b> at <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> the electrical <b>supply</b> and snatching at the couplings whilst moving as they come {{on and off the}} power. The latter places undue stress on couplings and has been known to cause separations of a train. Raworth overcame this by having a motor-generator set (booster) with a large flywheel on the shaft between the two. The traction current, instead of feeding the traction motors directly through the control assembly, powered a large motor which turned a shaft with the flywheel and fed into the generator. The output of the generator could be combined with the 3rd rail power to reduce or boost the voltage applied to the traction motors. With the generator output polarity reversed, the control assembly could deliver around 1200 V DC by combining the generator output with the 650 V from the 3rd rail to give positive 650 V and negative 500-600 V - leading to the nickname [...] "boosters". The flywheel ensured the generator continued to turn whilst no current was available from the 3rd rail, thus ensuring a continuous supply to the traction motors.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{paper is}} aimed at {{assessing}} the effects of outsourcing for organisations {{especially those in the}} defence industry. The author analysed the strategic reasoning behind the outsourcing approach and other motivating factors that include financial, strategic and political. To a higher degree, the paper identified that most authors attribute outsourcing as a strategy that helps an organisation retain and sustain its competitive advantage over its rivals through focus on its core activities. The study revealed that the biggest driver for an organisation to get to a competitive advantage is through flexibility. Flexibility is interweaved with other outsourcing motives such as improved time to market, access to new technology, transforming fixed costs into variables and focus on core activity. Further the author identified that flexibility is also key for an organisation to suit the lean approach and concept that is demanded by modern supply chain strategy. The lean concept was also an area of worth mention as its synchronisation with Just-in-time approach emphasise the elimination of waste and production of item only when they are needed in contrast with over production and pushing them to end user. Flexibility was also analysed to be another key factor as the concept of continuance improvement through which avoidance of wastes or Muda is founded. The paper further analysed outsourcing risks. This was another area worth exploring as risk in business would mean <b>break</b> down <b>in</b> <b>supply</b> chain that can be attributed as putting a spanner in the works thereby all the mechanism fail. This is in recognition to the fact that supply chain requires a smooth flow of activities since it looks at satisfying the end user from production line. Flawless supply chain mechanism would mean that the production line is risk free and all this is attributed to flexibility among other factors...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{studies in}} labour {{economics}} often suffer from endogeneity problems. Employing exogenous variations in policies and natural shock, this thesis investigates three topics. The first two topics concern labour market phenomena in Thailand, whereas the third provides {{a case study}} of labour demand adjustment after an international supply chain shock. Chapter 2 assesses the impact of minimum wage policy on wage inequality in Thailand. The result is rather mixed. Although the minimum wage effectively reduces wage inequality among workers in formal sectors, it does not affect the wage distribution in the informal sector at all. The evidence suggests that such a result is mainly driven by weak law enforcement. Meanwhile, using changes in compulsory schooling law, chapter 3 provides consistent estimates of the rates of return to education in Thailand. Based on the IV method, only female employees experience a positive and significant return to (upper primary) education. Interestingly, the size and direction of bias of the estimator, especially for male sub-sample, are not consistent with the conventional result. The possible reasons underlying these findings are elaborated. Chapter 4 relies on a different type of shock. The Great Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami 2011 is treated as an external shock to the international supply chain of Auto industry. Then I estimate the impact of the supply chain disruption on labour inputs adjustment in the US auto industry. Despite the <b>break</b> down <b>in</b> <b>supply</b> chain of motor vehicle parts and accessories among Japanese auto companies, these firms do not seem to reduce their labour inputs (used as a proxy for changes in production) significantly except for a small drop in average monthly earnings of workers in Japanese assembly plants. Also, their competitors make only slight adjustment to capitalize on the Japanese loss. Regarding other margins of adjustment, there is no evidence in support of the adjustment through import or price. Yet inventories and sales incentive appear to be major tools employed to mitigate either positive demand or negative supply shocks on both groups of companies...|$|R

The recipient bodies had to be kept alive with mechanical ventilation and drugs to stimulate the heart. The grafted heads were able to function - the eyes tracked moving objections and it could chew and swallow. There were problems with the grafting of blood vessels that led to blood clots forming, and White used high doses of immunosuppressive drugs that had severe side effects; the animals died between 6 hours and 3 days after the heads were engrafted.
