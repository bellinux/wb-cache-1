Our results show that correlation experiments can improve the performance of collective light scattering diagnostics. We have also investigated the scaterring of light by a drift vortex street.

40|$|A new {{strain and}} stress {{measurement}} method is developed for Siemens General Area Detector Diffraction System (GADDS). The conventional “ sin 2 ψ ” method has been commonly used for stress measurement with point detectors or one-dimensional position-sensitive detectors. However, the conventional method can only {{use a small}} fraction of the diffraction data collected by a 2 D (two-dimensional) detector. In the new method, a direct relationship between the stress tensor and the diffraction conic section distortion is given. The new theory, which combines the elasticity theory and the <b>Bragg</b> <b>law</b> into one equation, provides a basis for strain and stress measurements with 2 D detectors. All the diffraction data collected by the two-dimensional detector, including data with different lattice plane indices can be used simultaneously to solve the stress tensor. By introducing a pseudo hydrostatic stress component, the stress tensor for the biaxial stress state can be calculated with an approximate value of the unstressed d-spacing. Since it is possible to measure stress without sample rotation during the whole procedure, the incident beam coverage on the sample is fixed. This allows the method to be used for complex sample surface, microdiffraction, and residual stress mapping over the sample surface area. An experimental comparison between the conventional method and the new method shows that the new method can measure residual stress with higher accuracy from the same set of 2 D detector data. ...|$|E
40|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} measurement in {{the bulk}} of engineering components allows evaluation of lattice spacing variation by application of <b>Bragg</b> <b>law</b> and hence, by comparison with a strain-free reference specimen, computation of elastic strains and stresses. Diffraction peak position is related to average elastic strain within the scattering grains, whilst diffraction peak shape is related to crystallite size and so-called root mean square (RMS) - strain, which refers {{to the spread of}} lattice parameter values around the average. This spread arises {{as a result of the}} anisotropic elastic and plastic properties of the individual crystallites, which, under macroscopic plastic deformation, lead to a non-uniform distribution of inter- and intra-granular elastic and plastic strains. It has been shown in the literature, that, based on monochromatic diffraction experiments, a correlation of peak width and equivalent plastic strain can be established for a given material. In this paper a correlation of plastic strain versus peakwidth is established based on energy dispersive Synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements of a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V 4 point bend specimen. The correlation is then used to map equivalent plastic strain within a plate specimen of the same material in which two semicircular notches act as stress concentrators during tensile loading, inducing a known, non-uniform equivalent plastic strain field. The resulting map is compared with measurements of equivalent plastic strain by digital image correlation. The extent of the plastic zone observed shows qualitative agreement, however the equivalent plastic strain values predicted by peakwidth analysis are lower than those deduced from digital image correlation...|$|E
40|$|The {{reversible}} {{color change}} of the silole-infiltrated SiO 2 inverse opal photonic crystal (IOPC) film {{can be obtained by}} alternating its exposure to different vapor environments. When the film was put in diethyl ether or petroleum ether vapor, a stopband red shift of more than 100 nm could be clearly observed, while the color changed from green to red. When exposed to air, the stopband underwent a blue shift and the color changed back to green. The result is attributed to the silole molecules, hexaphenylsilole (HPS), which can be transformed reversibly between the crystal and amorphous state when alternately exposed to air and vapors of diethyl ether/petroleum ether. When crystal HPS changed to amorphous HPS in an atmosphere of organic vapors, both the specific surface area and refractive index of HPS increased. The higher specific surface area of HPS improved the adsorption behavior of organic vapors. Both the improved adsorption and higher refractive index of HPS increased the effective refractive index of HPS-infiltrated SiO 2 IOPC, which resulted in the red shift of the stopband and the color change, according to the <b>Bragg</b> <b>Law.</b> Based on the reversible aggregation state transfer and the adsorption-desorption of organic vapors, the effective refractive index of the film varied repeatedly, which caused the reversible stopband shift and color change.

Standing-wave mechanism and Kossel diffraction can be viewed as space reversed processes by virtue of the reciprocity theorem. Kossel interferences have been yet observed using incident X-ray radiation [3 - 4], electrons [1 - 2, 5] and ions [6], in crystals [2, 5 - 6] and in periodic multilayers [2 - 4]. In the present work, we have studied the characteristic Cr and Sc K emissions produced by a periodic Cr/B 4 C/S multilayer exposed to a beam of 2 MeV-protons. The period of the multilayer is close to 2 nm. The intensity of these two emission lines is measured as function of the grazing exit angle, i. e. the angle between the direction of the detector and that of the surface of the multilayer. In the case of the Sc K emission, in Figure 1 we compare the experimental results to those calculated combining a classical recursive approach to the reciprocity theorem. To our knowledge, it is the first time that ions are used to induce Kossel diffraction in a multilayer. Refined details about the structure of the stack could be obtained, especially the profile and nature of the interfaces.
