A large PDS tornado watch with very high tornado probabilities was issued that afternoon for that same area. Widespread tornado warnings were issued in that area later that evening.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the central}} and local governments kept an {{enormous}} number of records about land property in order to assess taxes, it became common practice in the Tang for literate and affluent people to create their own private documents and signed contracts. These had their own signature and that of a witness and scribe in order to prove in court (if necessary) that their claim to property was legitimate. The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while contractual language <b>became</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.|$|E

5|$|Arundel {{joined the}} {{opposition}} {{at an early}} point, and {{did not attend the}} Stamford parliament in July 1309, where Gaveston's return was negotiated. After Gaveston returned, his behaviour <b>became</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> offensive, and opposition towards him grew. In addition to this, there was great discontent with Edward II's failure to follow up his father's Scottish campaigns. On 16 March 1310, the king had to agree to the appointment of a committee known as the Lords Ordainers, who were {{to be in charge of}} the reform of the royal government. Arundel was one of eight earls among the twenty-one Ordainers.|$|E
5|$|During the Hellenistic period, mythology {{took on the}} {{prestige}} of elite knowledge that marks its possessors as belonging to a certain class. At the same time, the skeptical turn of the Classical age <b>became</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> pronounced. Greek mythographer Euhemerus established the tradition of seeking an actual historical basis for mythical beings and events. Although his original work (Sacred Scriptures) is lost, much is known about it from what is recorded by Diodorus and Lactantius.|$|E
5|$|In Egypt, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps were {{defeated}} by British forces under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery in October 1942. The Allies landed in Sicily in July 1943 and in Italy in September. Meanwhile, American and British bomber fleets based in Britain began operations against Germany {{and in an}} effort to destroy German morale many sorties were intentionally given civilian targets. Soon German aircraft production could not keep pace with losses and without air cover the Allied bombing campaign <b>became</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> devastating. By targeting oil refineries and factories, they crippled the German war effort by late 1944.|$|E

5|$|In hip hop culture, a grill (most {{commonly}} referred to as grills), also known as fronts or golds, is a type of jewelry worn over the teeth. Grills are made of metal and are generally removable. They began to be worn by hip-hop artists in New York City in the early 1980s, and upgraded during the '90s in Oakland. They <b>became</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> widely popular during the mid-2000s due to the rise of Southern hip hop rap and the more mainstream pop culture status hip hop attained.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's {{geographical}} {{location in the}} Midwest, its large population, and its agricultural production made the state's wartime support critical to the Union's success. Indiana, with the fifth-largest population of the states that remained in the Union, could supply much-needed manpower for the war effort, its railroad network {{and access to the}} Ohio River and the Great Lakes could transport troops and supplies, and its agricultural yield, which <b>became</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> valuable to the Union after the loss of the rich farmland of the South, could provide grain and livestock.|$|E
5|$|Orozco {{remained}} unsatisfied {{with the}} political positions he was offered in the Madero government. He <b>became</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> angry when Madero asked him to fight Zapata in central Mexico. As a result, in March 1912--less {{than a year after}} the battle of Ciudad Juárez--Orozco formally declared himself in rebellion against Madero. He subsequently supported Victoriano Huerta in his coup d'état against Madero. After Huerta's fall Orozco went into exile in the US and was eventually killed by Texas Rangers while trying to make his way back into Mexico to start another revolt.|$|E

5|$|Rotary fan, {{manual and}} water-powered: For {{purposes}} of air conditioning, the Han Dynasty craftsman and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) invented a manually operated rotary fan with seven wheels that measured 3m (10ft) in diameter; in the 8th century, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the Chinese applied hydraulic power to rotate the fan wheels for air conditioning, while the rotary fan <b>became</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> common during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The first rotary fan used in Europe was for mine ventilation during the 16th century, {{as illustrated by}} German mineralogist and metallurgist Georg Agricola (1494–1555).|$|E
5|$|The market {{soon became}} popular {{throughout}} Athens, {{as it was}} one of the few pastourma and soutzouki sellers in the city. The company <b>became</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> popular when Miran Kourounlian's son Bedros took over management in 1960 and began distributing the products throughout Greece. The store originally occupied an area of 3 m2. In 1983 Bedros expanded the Miran product factory to 1300 m2. After the death of Bedros in the 1990s, the family business was passed to his heirs, brothers Miran and Krikor Kourounlian, who manage the business today.|$|E
5|$|About half {{of those}} {{who lost their lives}} on the Wall were killed in the first five years after it was {{originally}} installed. Death rates fell from then on, and took a particularly dramatic downturn after 1976. Nearly 86% of the Wall's victims, 120 people, died between 1961 and 1975; between 1976 and 1989 only 19 died. Several factors account for this reduction. The Wall <b>became</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> impregnable owing to technical improvements carried out in the mid-1970s and more restrictions were put on the area adjoining the Wall, making it more difficult to reach in the first place. The signing of the Helsinki Accords in 1975 led to new opportunities to cross the border legally, resulting in a rise in emigration applications and a corresponding fall in escape attempts.|$|E

5|$|As Galveston's {{traditional}} economy declined, Texas' {{oil boom}} began in 1901, with oil wells and refineries constructed throughout the state. Galveston's direct {{role in this}} boom was minimal as investors avoided building pipelines and refineries on the island itself (though for a time oil was shipped through the island). Nevertheless, wealth {{brought on by the}} boom transformed nearby Houston, Texas City, Goose Creek (modern Baytown), and other communities. Houston in particular became home to a large community of wealthy businessmen and investors. Galveston <b>became</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> tourism-focused as the city sought to attract these nearby nouveau riche. Still, in the first two decades after the 1900 storm, the city's economy struggled to recover.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's {{exclusive}} {{access to the}} King provoked {{several members of the}} nobility, and in 1307 the King was again forced to send him into exile. During this absence he served as the King's Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Edward managed to negotiate a deal with the opposition, however, and Gaveston returned the next year. Upon his return his behaviour <b>became</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> offensive, and by the Ordinances of 1311 it was decided that Gaveston should be exiled for a third time, to suffer outlawry if he returned. When he did return in 1312, he was hunted down and executed by a group of magnates led by Thomas of Lancaster and Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} in this reign in 1530, that Henry VIII conferred on the College {{one of its most}} {{important}} duties for almost a century, the heraldic visitation. The provincial Kings of Arms were commissioned under a royal warrant to enter all houses and churches and given authority to deface and destroy all arms unlawfully used by any knight, esquire, or gentleman. Around the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries this duty <b>became</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> necessary as the monasteries were previously repositories of local genealogical records. From then on, all genealogical records and the duty of recording them was subsumed by the College. These visitations were serious affairs, and many individuals were charged and heavily fined for breaking the law of arms. Hundreds of these visitations were carried out well into the 17th century; the last was in 1686.|$|E

5|$|Ivan Skorokhodov, {{yet another}} of the guards, smuggled in a {{birthday}} cake to celebrate Maria's nineteenth birthday on June 26, 1918. Maria slipped away from the group with Ivan Skorokhodov for a private moment and they were discovered together in a compromising position when two of his superiors conducted a surprise inspection of the house. Skorokhodov was removed from his position after his actions and friendliness towards the grand duchess were discovered by his commanding officers. In their memoirs, several guards reported that both the Tsarina and her older sister Olga appeared angry with Maria {{in the days following}} the incident and that Olga avoided her company. After this incident, a new command was installed, the family was forbidden from fraternizing with the officers and the conditions of their imprisonment <b>became</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> strict.|$|E
5|$|Merrick's {{condition}} gradually deteriorated {{during his}} {{four years at}} the London Hospital. He required {{a great deal of}} care from the nursing staff and spent much of his time in bed, or sitting in his quarters, with diminishing energy. His facial deformities continued to grow and his head <b>became</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> enlarged. He died on 11 April 1890, at the age of 27. At around 3:00p.m., Treves's house surgeon visited Merrick and found him lying dead across his bed. His body was formally identified by his uncle, Charles Merrick. An inquest was held on 15 April by Wynne Edwin Baxter, who had come to notoriety conducting inquests for the Whitechapel murders of 1888.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the ships}} sailed into port at Canton, they alarmed the Chinese {{residents}} and officials there by discharging cannon fire, {{what they believed}} was a friendly salute since the Chinese merchants had done so when the Portuguese earlier arrived in Malacca. Chinese officials <b>became</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> cautious {{in dealing with the}} Portuguese, since the deposed King of Malacca had been a loyal tributary to the imperial Ming court. The Portuguese explained that in deposing the Malaccan king, they were helping the Chinese merchants there who were being oppressed under his rule. In the eyes of the Canton officials, this added further negative speculations about the Portuguese visitors, because private Chinese overseas trade was banned under the current hai jin laws that stated only the Chinese government could conduct foreign trade.|$|E
