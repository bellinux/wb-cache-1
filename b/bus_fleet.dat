5|$|After the Great Depression, the {{maintenance}} of the tramway system and the purchase of new trams suffered. Competition from private buses, the MTT's own <b>bus</b> <b>fleet</b> and the growth of private car ownership all took patrons from the tram network. By the 1950s, the tram network was losing money and being replaced by an electric and petrol-driven <b>bus</b> <b>fleet.</b> Adelaide's tram history is preserved by the volunteer-run Tramway Museum, St Kilda and the continuing use of 1929 H type trams on the remaining Glenelg tram line.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} buses ran on diesel fuel, but {{the system}} allows for buses that run on alternative energy sources. Biodiesel fuel and natural gas have been trialled, and 20% of the Adelaide <b>bus</b> <b>fleet</b> uses compressed natural gas, 48% B20 and 32% B5 biodiesel blends. The design of the O-Bahn allows for the installation of overhead wires for trolleybuses.|$|E

40|$|The public {{transport}} sector in Sweden {{has set a}} target to run 90 % of its total vehicle-kilometers on renewable fuels by 2020, and double its market share in the long term. The focus {{of this paper is}} the adoption of renewable fuels in public <b>bus</b> <b>fleets.</b> Data for all 21 Swedish counties were gathered and analyzed, mapping the bus fleets’ condition in relation to renewable fuel deployment, CO 2 emissions and energy efficiency. The main factors affecting fuel choices in the <b>bus</b> <b>fleets</b> were investigated through a survey among environmental managers and transport planners at regional {{public transport}} authorities. The analysis highlights the challenges implied in the rapid shift that regional <b>bus</b> <b>fleets</b> are undergoing to adopt renewable fuels and reduce emissions. Political will and procurement have been strong success factors in facing these challenges. The survey indicates the stakeholders’ interest to switch to electricity for city routes, while biodiesel and HVO are preferred for longer routes. When it comes to how fuel choices are made, environmental factors seem to be prioritized, while the barriers identified are mainly economic and political.

40|$|Around the world, {{more and}} more cities already have {{introduced}} electric-powered <b>bus</b> <b>fleets</b> or are planning {{to do so in}} the near future. Thus far, electrical-powered <b>bus</b> <b>fleets</b> have not yet been applied to regional bus services. This paper analyzes the boundary conditions of the operational integration of electrically powered <b>bus</b> <b>fleets</b> in regional <b>bus</b> services. The paper introduces a methodical approach which can be used to identify the optimum deployment strategy for electrical-powered buses which is a combination of technological factors (e. g. dimensions of energy storage and charging technology) the operational regime to be applied (e. g. routing and scheduling). The methodical approach is exemplarily instantiated with the analysis of sample data of a bus line in a topographically challenging region. The model-driven prognosis of the vehicle’s state of charge is the basis for the definition of an optimum deployment strategy for electrical-powered buses on that line...|$|R

5|$|NYC Ferry {{operates}} three {{shuttle bus}} routes. One is a preexisting NY Waterway {{service to the}} East 34th Street landing. The other two are brand-new services to the Rockaway landing, which is at Beach 108th Street. One route goes west to Jacob Riis Park, while the other was originally planned for operation between the ferry landing and Beach 67th Street, but was ultimately extended eastward. The Environmental Impact Statement provided for {{an extension of the}} Beach 67th Street bus to Beach 31st Street via Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach Channel Drive, but de Blasio's office said that extending the bus further would cause a <b>bus</b> <b>fleet</b> shortage, resulting in passengers missing their boats.

5|$|The town's tram, {{trolleybus}} and <b>bus</b> <b>fleet</b> {{was always}} painted in crimson and off-white colours, with ornate gold lining {{out until the}} outbreak of World War II. The buses were notable in that they never carried exterior advertisements, with the town's crest occupying the space between decks where other bus operators placed adverts; and they carried two green lights on the front, to enable the town's ratepayers to see at night {{which was one of}} the town's own buses and not one of those of a competitor. At local government reorganisation in April 1974, the Wigan Corporation Transport Department became part of Greater Manchester Transport.

40|$|The Swedish public {{transport}} sector has defined two major targets, i. e., to run 90 % {{of the total}} vehicle kilometers of the fleet on non-fossil fuels and double the volume of travel via {{public transport}} by 2020, increasing the share of public transport {{in relation to the}} total personal transport in the country. The f 3  report Fuel options for public <b>bus</b> <b>fleets</b> in Sweden highlights the challenges and solutions encountered, {{particularly when it comes to}} the adoption of renewable fuels in the regional <b>bus</b> <b>fleets.</b> As a result of the efforts made in the last few years, renewables respond for 60 % of the fuels used in bus transport in Sweden compared to approximately 10 % in 2009.   Political will to promote decarbonization of public transport has speeded up the shift towards renewables in <b>bus</b> <b>fleets,</b> while fuel tax exemptions have made deployment feasible.  Environmental aspects, such as emission reduction potential and energy efficiency, are a priority when choosing fuels, together with infrastructure needs and fuel availability.   Biodiesel has been the preferred fuel while increasing deployment of renewable fuels in buses, especially in scarcely populated regions. In addition, the compatibility with traditional diesel engines has favored this option among service providers. The use ofbiogas is increasing in line with incentives at local and national level. The deployment of electricity in buses is only found in city traffic, while the major choice for regional routes is usually biodiesel.   QC 20151201 </p...|$|R
