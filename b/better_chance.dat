5|$|Various {{species are}} known to feed on dead {{arthropods}} (scavenging), web silk, and their own shed exoskeletons. Pollen caught in webs may also be eaten, and {{studies have shown that}} young spiders have a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of survival if they have the opportunity to eat pollen. In captivity, several spider species are also known to feed on bananas, marmalade, milk, egg yolk and sausages.|$|E
5|$|After the score, Tech was penalized 15 {{yards for}} {{excessive}} celebration, allowing Texas a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> {{to return the}} post-score kickoff. Texas' kick returner fumbled the return, however and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Texas 10-yard line. On the first play after the kickoff, Brown was sacked at the Texas two-yard line. Williams regained some of the lost yardage with a five-yard run, but on third down he was stopped after another five-yard gain. Rather than attempt to convert the fourth down, Texas punted with 2:33 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|As NHL {{play was}} set to resume for the 2005–06season, Näslund became an {{unrestricted}} free agent. On the open market for several days, he re-signed with the Canucks for three more years on 3 August 2005, at $6million per season. Vancouver newspaper The Province reported that two other teams had offered deals that matched the contract he signed, but Näslund ultimately chose to remain with the Canucks because he felt the club had a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of winning the Stanley Cup. At the time, Näslund said he hoped to retire as a Canuck.|$|E

5|$|As {{many more}} {{individuals}} of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, {{there is a}} frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.|$|E
5|$|Eyespots are {{a type of}} automimicry used by some lepidopterans. In butterflies, {{the spots}} are {{composed}} of concentric rings of scales of different colours. The proposed role of the eyespots is to deflect predators' attention. Their resemblance to eyes provokes the predator's instinct to attack these wing patterns. The role of filamentous tails in Lycaenidae has been suggested as confusing predators as to the real location of the head, giving them a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of escaping alive and relatively unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Kurt is a SPARTAN-II {{who serves}} in John-117's squad. Kurt {{is known for}} his sense of intuition, which saves his team on several occasions. Recruited to train a new series of Spartans, Kurt is devastated by the massive {{casualties}} his trainees suffer. In response, Kurt begins instituting illegal brain modifications to give his soldiers a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> at survival. Due to the secretive lengths taken by his superiors to recruit him to the program, none of Kurt's former colleagues know he is alive.|$|E

5|$|Males perch after {{emerging}} from their nest. They pick out an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as to have a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of mating. They tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches. Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator. One study by a behavioral ecologist, John Alcock, showed that {{a large majority of}} the marked wasps returned to the same perch day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphians {{saw three}} ballot {{questions}} in the primary election, all of which involved allowing the city to borrow money. The loans, on the ballot at Clark's urging, were designed to allow the city to temporarily increase spending without raising taxes, and were opposed by many ward leaders in both parties. As a result, they went down to unexpected defeat by a 3:2 margin. Undeterred, Clark and his allies revised and relisted the loans for {{a vote in the}} general election in November, which would see better turnout and, they believed, a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of success.|$|E
5|$|Simpson {{decided to}} move to the {{continent}} for a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> at success, and contacted French brothers Robert and Yvon Murphy, whom he met while racing. They agreed that he could stay with them in the Breton fishing port of Saint-Brieuc. His final event in Britain was at Herne Hill, riding motor-paced races. Simpson won the event and was invited to Germany to train for the 1959 motor-paced world championships, but declined the opportunity in favour of a career on the road. Bicycle manufacturer Elswick Hopper invited him to join their British-based team, but Benny Foster advised him to continue with his plans to move to France.|$|E

5|$|The parasite/host {{relationship}} probably {{drove the}} prevalence of sexual reproduction over the more efficient asexual reproduction. It seems that when a parasite infects a host, sexual reproduction affords a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of developing resistance (through variation in the next generation), giving sexual reproduction variability for fitness not seen in the asexual reproduction, which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same parasite. Coevolution between host and parasite may accordingly be responsible {{for much of the}} genetic diversity seen in normal populations, including blood-plasma polymorphism, protein polymorphism, and histocompatibility systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{peppered}} moth exists in both {{light and dark}} colours in Great Britain, but during the industrial revolution, many of the trees on which the moths rested became blackened by soot, giving the dark-coloured moths an advantage in hiding from predators. This gave dark-coloured moths a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of surviving to produce dark-coloured offspring, and in just fifty years from the first dark moth being caught, {{nearly all of the}} moths in industrial Manchester were dark. The balance was reversed by the effect of the Clean Air Act 1956, and the dark moths became rare again, demonstrating the influence of natural selection on {{peppered moth}} evolution.|$|E
5|$|Tourism is {{the most}} {{significant}} contributor to Kalimpong's economy. The summer and spring seasons are the most popular with tourists, keeping many of town's residents employed directly and indirectly. The town—earlier an important trade post between India and Tibet—hopes to boost its economy after the reopening of the Nathu La (pass) in April 2006. Though this has resumed Indo–China border trades, it is expected that Kalimpong will have a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of revival as a hub for Indo–China trades if the demand of local leaders for reopening of Jelep La pass also is met.|$|E

5|$|When {{only the}} four {{alliance}} members remained, the vote initially {{ended in a}} draw; close allies Richard and Rudy voted for Susan, and Susan and Kelly voted for Richard. On the revote, Kelly decided to switch her vote and Susan was eliminated. After winning the final immunity challenge, Kelly decided to eliminate Rudy because she believed she had a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> against Richard. At the final Tribal Council, Susan lambasted Kelly for switching her vote and proclaimed her support for Richard. Richard's strategic prowess and leadership were valued over Kelly's impressive challenge performances, and the jury awarded him the title of Sole Survivor in a vote of 4-3.|$|E
5|$|After {{his final}} season at Michigan, Robinson {{stated that he}} was open to playing any {{position}} in the National Football League. Some suggested {{that he would have}} a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of being drafted by an NFL team if he switched to cornerback, receiver, running back or kick returner because of his quickness – 4.35 in the 40 yard dash. CBS Sports' Mike Freeman said his talents would be wasted on the defensive side of the ball. Doug Flutie (Buffalo Bills) and Dieter Brock (Los Angeles Rams) were relatively successful quarterbacks similar in stature to Robinson. Russell Wilson who currently plays starting quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks is also similar in stature to Robinson.|$|E
5|$|In late May and June he {{collected}} and experimented {{on a number}} of the new Sopwith Pups which began to reach British units in January. He was impressed with the aircraft's agility and flew it often. During this period he met the now famous ace Albert Ball who advised him attack tactics against reconnaissance and bomber aircraft. Ball advised McCudden to fly underneath his target, in the blind spot of the observer, and angle his guns directly above then fire. McCudden was intrigued at the prospect and believed this offered a much <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of shooting down an enemy aircraft. It is not clear if, or how often, McCudden implemented Ball's advice in battle and how many of his victories were claimed that way. McCudden's principal tactics did stress surprise and minimal risk.|$|E

5|$|Raëlians {{believe that}} {{humanity}} {{would be able}} to create life on other planets only if humanity is peaceful enough to stop war. In that case, humanity could travel the distances between stars and create life on another planet. Progress in terraforming, molecular biology, and cloning would enable these teams to create continents and life from scratch. Progress in social engineering would ensure that this creation would have a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of both surviving and having the potential to understand its creators. Research on how civilization would occur on another planet would allow scientists to decide what traces of their origin should be left behind so that their role in life creation would someday be revealed. The progress achieved by the science teams would ultimately sustain a perpetual chain of life.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} bout of illness subsided, Augustus {{gave up his}} consulship. The only other times Augustus would serve as consul {{would be in the}} years 5 and 2BC, both times to {{introduce}} his grandsons into public life. This was a clever ploy by Augustus; ceasing to serve as one of two annually elected consuls allowed aspiring senators a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> to attain the consular position, while allowing Augustus to exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class. Although Augustus had resigned as consul, he desired to retain his consular imperium not just in his provinces but throughout the empire. This desire, as well as the Marcus Primus Affair, led to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement.|$|E
5|$|The Army of Rhin-et-Moselle led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau was {{deployed}} {{with its}} right flank at Huningue, its {{center on the}} Queich River and its left flank at Saarbrücken. The Army of Sambre-et-Meuse commanded by Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was responsible for a line running north from Sankt Wendel to Cologne, while the 22,000 men of its left wing under Jean-Baptiste Kléber held Düsseldorf. The French grand strategy designed by Minister of War Lazare Carnot was for each of their two armies to turn the Austrian flanks. The strategic plan called for Jourdan to start by advancing by his left wing and was designed to accomplish two goals. First, {{it was hoped that}} this would cause the Austrians to abandon {{the west bank of the}} Rhine. Second, the move would draw Austrian strength north and allow Moreau's army a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> to cross the Rhine in the south.|$|E
