5000|$|The {{introduction}} of electric light bulbs {{made it possible}} to produce colour light signals which were bright enough to be seen during daylight, starting in 1904. These at first were [...] "short-range" [...] signals, used in low-speed applications. Improvements in signal glassware by Dr. Churchill of Cornell University in conjunction with Corning Glass Works (Corning, New York) increased the daylight viewing range to that of [...] "medium-range" [...] signals. These were quickly adopted by many U.S. rapid transit and trolley (street, light) railway systems. Ultimately, by 1913, Dr. Churchill developed the [...] "doublet lens" [...] combination wherein an outer clear Fresnel lens was sealed with inwards facing ribs to an inner glass of the desired colour with ribs facing the outer lens. Both inner and outer exposed surfaces were therefore smooth, avoiding dirt accumulation. The inner lens convexity permitted a 35-watt, 10-volt lamp filament to be almost surrounded by this system, gathering much more of the light produced than with previous systems. This yielded the first true [...] "long-range" [...] daylight signal with a range of over 2500 ft under bright sun conditions. The first application was by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad's use of the US&S [...] "Style L" [...] colour light signal on their line through the Pacific Northwest in 1914. These were intentionally fitted from the start with two lamps one ahead of the other, the circuitry so arranged that failure of the main lamp caused the lighting the <b>back-up</b> <b>lamp</b> to assure the most restrictive indication always being illuminated. The final improvement came in the early 1920s with Corning's [...] "High Transmission" [...] glass colours, increasing this range to 3500 ft under bright sun conditions. The results were that in the U.S., all semaphore manufacturing had ceased by 1944, having been completely replaced with light signals of one type or another.|$|E

50|$|The {{big news}} at Cadillac in 1949 {{centered}} on engineering, {{with the release}} of a new overhead valve V8 engine. This 331 inÂ³ engine produced 160 hp (119 kW). Only minor appearance changes were seen. They included a more massive grille treatment with grooved extension panels housing the front parking lights and chevron slashes below the taillamps on the coupes. Once again the cars in this line lacked front fender gravel shields and rocker panel moldings and had plainer interior trim. A larger luggage compartment lid was seen on all sedans except early production units. Standard equipment now included twin <b>back-up</b> <b>lamps</b> mounted on the deck lid latch panel.|$|R

50|$|Visually the 1300 was {{distinguished}} {{by a new}} grille design housing single instead of twin head lamps, rectangular side repeaters without ornamentation, and all-metal hubcaps. It also did without bumper over-riders, most pieces of exterior chrome trim, and rear <b>back-up</b> <b>lamps.</b> Inside dashboard and steering wheel came from the TI (though the latter was all-black), there were rubber mats instead of carpets, and several convenience features such as the passenger grab handle and rear ashtrays were omitted.In September 1967 the Giulia 1300 was updated, adopting a black mesh grille with three horizontal chrome bars, the vertical louvres {{at the base of}} the windshield first seen on the Giulia Super, the second series Giulia TI three round instrument dashboard, and the 1300 ti's three-spoke steering wheel.|$|R

50|$|The 1960 Cadillacs had smoother, more {{restrained}} styling. General changes {{included a}} full-width grille, {{the elimination of}} pointed front bumper guards, increased restraint {{in the application of}} chrome trim, lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles and front fender mounted directional indicator lamps. DeVilles were distinguished by special script nameplates on the rear fenders. Four-window and six-window hardtop sedans were offered again. The former featured a one-piece wraparound backlight and flat-top roof, while the latter had a sloping rear window and roofline. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual <b>back-up</b> <b>lamps,</b> windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows and a two-way power seats. Technical highlights were finned rear drums and an X-frame construction. Interiors were done in Chadwick cloth or optional Cambray cloth and leather combinations.|$|R
5000|$|While styling for the Jet was conservative, the Italia was {{anything}} but. The Italia was 10 in lower than a Jet. Over the headlights, the front fenders featured [...] "V" [...] shaped scoops, ducting cooling {{air to the}} front brakes, but they really only vent [...] "the underside of the fender {{and the top of}} the tire." [...] The front bumper sported a large inverted [...] "V" [...] (the trademark Hudson triangle, inverted) in the center that angled up and overlapped the grille work. Rear quarter scoops cooled the rear brakes. In the back of the car, the tail, directional, and <b>back-up</b> <b>lamps</b> tipped the ends of three stacked chrome tubes per side, emerging from scalloped cut-outs in the rear quarter panels. The production models did not receive overdrive, the instrument panel was different, and a combination of leather-and-vinyl upholstery was used.|$|R
2500|$|... 1967 was {{the final}} year for the C2 generation. The 1967 model {{featured}} restyled fender vents, less ornamentation, and <b>back-up</b> <b>lamps</b> which were on the inboard in 1966 were now rectangular and centrally located. The first use of all four taillights in red started in 1961 and was continued thru the C-2 line-up except for the 1966. The 1967 and subsequent models continuing on all Corvettes since. 1967 had the first L88 engine option which was rated at , but unofficial estimates place the actual output at [...] or more. Only twenty such engines were installed at the factory. From 1967 (to 1969), the Holley triple two-barrel carburetor, or Tri-Power, was available on the 427 L89 (a $368 option, {{on top of the}} cost for the high-performance 427). Despite these changes, sales slipped over 15%, to 22,940 (8,504 coupes, off close to 15%, and 14,436 convertibles, down nearly 19%).|$|R
25|$|In 1976 the Luxury and Regency {{editions of}} the {{full-size}} 98s were offered, in 2-door coupes or 4-door hardtops. 4-doors had an extra window (like an opera window) in the C-pillar. A landau roof option for the coupe gave it a huge-looking opera window. Like the Custom Cruiser, 98s had a dual section eggcrate-design grille, with new front end panel, front bumper, and wraparound horizontal parking lamps. Amber marker lenses aligned with the headlamps wrapped around the fender sides. Separate clear cornering lamps had horizontal ribs. Vertical tailamps were decorated with a small emblem in each lens. Tiny <b>back-up</b> <b>lamps</b> stood alongside the license plate, on a panel that also contained small red lenses next to the tailamps. Standard 98 equipment included a 455 CID Rocket V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, Turbo-Hydramatic, vari-ratio power steering, power brakes, power driver's seat, driver's door armrest control console, electronic message center, electric clock, fold-down center armrests, front ashtray, and JR78 x 15 blackwall steel-belted radials. Rear fender skirts and bumper impact strips were also standard. A new 2.41:1 axle ratio became standard to improve fuel economy.|$|R
50|$|The 1959 Cadillac {{is remembered}} for its huge sharp tailfins with dual bullet tail lights, two {{distinctive}} rooflines and roof pillar configurations, new jewel-like grille patterns and matching deck lid beauty panels. In 1959 the Series 62 were {{moved from the}} Series 62 to their own series, the Series 6200. DeVilles and 2-door Eldorados became the Series 6300 and Series 6400 respectively, though they all, including the 4-door Eldorado Brougham (which was moved from the Series 70 to Series 6900), shared the same 130 in wheelbase. Engine output was an even 325 hp (242 kW) from the 390 cuin L engine. The DeVille Series had script nameplates on the rear fenders. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, <b>back-up</b> <b>lamps,</b> windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows and two way power seats. Plain fender skirts covered the rear wheels and 4-doors were available in either four-window or six-window hardtop configurations. Over 53,000 DeVilles were sold {{in their first year}} as a separate series, accounting for roughly 37% of all Cadillacs sold.|$|R

Engine output was an even 325 hp (242 kW) from the 390 cuin L engine. The Series 62 was identifiable by its straight body rub moldings, running from front wheel opening to back bumpers, with crest medallions below the spear. A one-deck jeweled rear grille insert was seen. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, <b>back-up</b> <b>lamps,</b> windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror and oil filter. The convertible model had power windows and a two-way power seat. Plain fender skirts covered the rear wheels and 4-doors were available in either four-window or six-window hardtop configurations.

Pairs of individually housed round headlamps were wider apart, with a winged Cadillac crest set between each pair. The V-shaped grille had an eggcrate style insert and was protected by massive vertical guards framing a rectangular license plate indentation. A wide hood with full-length windsplints, a prominent center crease and hidden windshield wipers was seen. A Cadillac crest decorated the nose and new indicator lamps appeared atop each front fender. A horizontal beltline molding ran from behind the front wheel housing, almost to the rear stopping where an elliptical bulge in the body came to a point and where thin rectangular side markers were placed above and below the chrome strip. The rear wheel openings were again housed in fender skirts. Taillamps were of the same type as before but were no longer divided by a chrome bar. Long horizontal <b>back-up</b> <b>lamps</b> were set in the bumper, on either side of a deeply recessed license plate housing. The Calais wheelbase was extended to 130 in.|$|R
