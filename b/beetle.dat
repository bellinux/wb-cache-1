5|$|A {{number of}} insect pests infest stored dry {{foods such as}} flour, cereals and pasta; these include the Indian mealmoth, the {{cigarette}} <b>beetle,</b> the drugstore <b>beetle,</b> the confused flour <b>beetle,</b> the red flour <b>beetle,</b> the merchant grain <b>beetle,</b> the sawtoothed grain <b>beetle,</b> the wheat weevil, the maize weevil and the rice weevil.|$|E
5|$|An insect {{survey in}} September 2009 {{recorded}} 187 <b>beetle</b> species, including two new to Norfolk, the rove <b>beetle</b> Phytosus nigriventris and the fungus <b>beetle</b> Leiodes ciliaris, and two very rarely {{seen in the}} county, the sap <b>beetle</b> Nitidula carnaria and the clown <b>beetle</b> Gnathoncus nanus. There were also 24 types of spider, and the five ant species included the nationally rare Myrmica specioides. The rare millipede Thalassisobates littoralis, a specialist of coastal shingle habitats, was found here in 1972, and a red-veined darter appeared in 2012. Tens of thousands of migrant turnip sawflies were recorded {{for a few days}} in late summer 2006, along with red-eyed damselflies. The silver Y moth also appears in large numbers in some years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beetle</b> larvae can be {{differentiated}} {{from other}} insect larvae by their hardened, often darkened heads, {{the presence of}} chewing mouthparts, and spiracles {{along the sides of}} their bodies. Like adult beetles, the larvae are varied in appearance, particularly between <b>beetle</b> families. Beetles with somewhat flattened, highly mobile larvae include the ground beetles and rove beetles; their larvae are described as campodeiform. Some <b>beetle</b> larvae resemble hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs. These are elateriform larvae, and are found in the click <b>beetle</b> (Elateridae) and darkling <b>beetle</b> (Tenebrionidae) families. Some elateriform larvae of click beetles are known as wireworms. Beetles in the Scarabaeoidea have short, thick larvae described as scarabaeiform, more commonly known as grubs.|$|E

5|$|Beetles are {{prominent}} in human culture, from the sacred scarabs of ancient Egypt to beetlewing art and use as pets or fighting insects for entertainment and gambling. Many <b>beetle</b> groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects of collection and decorative displays. Over 300 species {{are used as}} food, mostly as larvae; species widely consumed include mealworms and rhinoceros <b>beetle</b> larvae. However, the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural pests. Serious pests include the boll weevil of cotton, the Colorado potato <b>beetle,</b> the coconut hispine <b>beetle,</b> and the mountain pine <b>beetle.</b> Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the lady beetles and dung beetles are beneficial by helping to control insect pests.|$|E
5|$|Parental care {{is found}} in a few species of <b>beetle,</b> perhaps for {{protection}} against adverse conditions and predators. The rove <b>beetle</b> Bledius spectabilis lives in salt marshes, so the eggs and larvae are endangered by the rising tide. The maternal <b>beetle</b> patrols the eggs and larvae, burrowing {{to keep them from}} flooding and asphyxiating, and protects them from the predatory carabid <b>beetle</b> Dicheirotrichus gustavi and from the parasitoidal wasp Barycnemis blediator, which kills some 15% of the larvae.|$|E
5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis, {{commonly}} known as the Lundy cabbage flea <b>beetle</b> or the bronze Lundy cabbage flea <b>beetle,</b> is a species of flea <b>beetle</b> endemic to the island of Lundy, where it lives and feeds upon the endemic Lundy cabbage (Coincya wrightii). Along with the true weevil Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes and an undescribed race of flea <b>beetle</b> Psylliodes napi, it is known only from the Lundy cabbage. The species was first recorded by Thomas Vernon Wollaston in the 1840s, and was named by the Austrian entomologist Franz Kutschera in 1864.|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{beneficial}} <b>beetles</b> in Utah besides lady <b>beetles</b> or ladybugs. <b>Beetles</b> can significantly reduce common insect and weed problems {{and in some}} cases eliminate the need for chemical control. Examples of beneficial <b>beetles</b> include: ground <b>beetles,</b> rove <b>beetles,</b> tiger <b>beetles</b> and tortoise <b>beetles.</b> Many of these <b>beetles</b> are native to Utah, while others have been purposely introduced to help control damage from exotic insect and weed pests...|$|R
5000|$|Cucujiformia — {{includes}} lady <b>beetles,</b> longhorn <b>beetles,</b> weevils, checkered <b>beetles</b> {{and leaf}} <b>beetles</b> ...|$|R
2500|$|Other <b>beetles</b> {{consumed}} include ground <b>beetles</b> and scarab <b>beetles.</b>|$|R
5|$|Some {{species of}} <b>beetle</b> have evolved {{immunity}} to insecticides. For example, the Colorado potato <b>beetle,</b> Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is a destructive pest of potato plants. Its hosts include {{other members of}} the Solanaceae, such as nightshade, tomato, eggplant and capsicum, as well as the potato. Different populations have between them developed resistance to all major classes of insecticide. The Colorado potato <b>beetle</b> was evaluated as a tool of entomological warfare during World War II, the idea being to use the <b>beetle</b> and its larvae to damage the crops of enemy nations. Germany tested its Colorado potato <b>beetle</b> weaponisation program south of Frankfurt, releasing 54,000 beetles.|$|E
5|$|The bark <b>beetle,</b> elm leaf <b>beetle</b> and the Asian longhorned <b>beetle</b> (Anoplophora glabripennis) {{are among}} the species that attack elm trees. Bark beetles (Scolytidae) carry Dutch elm disease as they move from {{infected}} breeding sites to healthy trees. The disease has devastated elm trees across Europe and North America.|$|E
5|$|The longest <b>beetle</b> is the Hercules <b>beetle</b> Dynastes hercules, with {{a maximum}} overall length of at least 16.7cm (6.6in) {{including}} the very long pronotal horn. The smallest recorded <b>beetle</b> and the smallest free-living insect (as of 2015), is the featherwing <b>beetle</b> Scydosella musawasensis which may measure as little as 325µm in length.|$|E

5000|$|Powderpost <b>beetles</b> are a {{group of}} seventy species of woodboring <b>beetles</b> {{classified}} in the insect subfamily Lyctinae. These <b>beetles,</b> along with spider <b>beetles,</b> death watch <b>beetles,</b> common furniture <b>beetles,</b> skin <b>beetles,</b> and others, make up the superfamily Bostrichoidea. While most woodborers have a large prothorax, powderpost <b>beetles</b> do not, making their heads more visible. In addition to this, their antennae have two-jointed clubs. They are considered pests and attack deciduous trees, over time reducing the wood to a powdery dust. The damage caused by longhorn <b>beetles</b> (family Cerambycidae) is often confused with that of powderpost <b>beetles,</b> but the two groups are unrelated. Their larvae are white and C-shaped.|$|R
50|$|Staphylinoidea, {{including}} antlike stone <b>beetles,</b> carrion <b>beetles,</b> and rove <b>beetles.</b>|$|R
5|$|A 2009 {{study of}} tansy <b>beetle</b> {{occupancy}} amongst 1305 patches (stems separated by {{no more than}} 50cm) of the tansy plant {{on the banks of the}} River Ouse (York, UK) intended to establish data on the distribution of tansy plants and relate this to existing tansy <b>beetle</b> populations in order to contribute to the conservation effort of the species. The results were analysed using generalised additive models to conclude that the tansy patches should be managed towards volumes of 3m and that these patches should be targeted within 200m of existing <b>beetle</b> subpopulations on the same river bank in order to help the <b>beetle</b> population disperse and survive.|$|E
5|$|Archostemata {{contains}} four {{families of}} mainly wood-eating beetles, including reticulated beetles (Cupedidae) and the telephone-pole <b>beetle.</b>|$|E
5|$|As well as plant based poisons, {{there are}} others that are made {{that are based on}} animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a <b>beetle</b> genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a {{slow-acting}} poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The <b>beetle</b> itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the <b>beetle</b> right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.|$|E
5000|$|Byrrhoidea — {{families}} including long-toed water <b>beetles,</b> moss <b>beetles</b> and mud-loving <b>beetles</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Like many flightless <b>beetles,</b> these <b>beetles</b> {{have limited}} wing {{musculature}} with a rounded abdomen and thorax, similar in appearance {{to a number}} of other flightless desert <b>beetles.</b> Cactus longhorn <b>beetles</b> resemble and mimic the behavior of noxious stink <b>beetles</b> in the genus Eleodes.|$|R
50|$|The Bostrichidae are {{a family}} of <b>beetles</b> with more than 700 {{described}} species. They are commonly called auger <b>beetles,</b> false powderpost <b>beetles,</b> or horned powderpost <b>beetles.</b> The head of most auger <b>beetles</b> cannot be seen from above, as it is downwardly directed and hidden by the thorax. Exceptions are the powderpost <b>beetles</b> (subfamily Lyctinae), {{and members of the}} subfamily Psoinae.|$|R
5|$|<b>Beetle</b> {{antennae}} {{are primarily}} organs of sensory perception and can detect motion, odour and chemical substances, {{but may also}} be used to physically feel a beetle's environment. <b>Beetle</b> families may use antennae in different ways. For example, when moving quickly, tiger beetles {{may not be able to}} see very well and instead hold their antennae rigidly in front of them in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Beetles are {{the most}} widely eaten insects, with about 344 species used as food, usually at the larval stage. The {{mealworm}} (the larva of the darkling <b>beetle)</b> and the rhinoceros <b>beetle</b> are among the species commonly eaten.|$|E
5|$|Books are {{sometimes}} attacked by cockroaches, silverfish, book mites, booklice, and various beetles which {{feed on the}} covers, paper, bindings and glue. They leave behind physical damage {{in the form of}} tiny holes as well as staining from their faeces. Book pests include the larder <b>beetle,</b> and the larvae of the black carpet <b>beetle</b> and the drugstore <b>beetle</b> which attack leather-bound books, while the common clothes moth and the brown house moth attack cloth bindings. These attacks are largely a problem with historic books, because modern bookbinding materials are less susceptible to this type of damage.|$|E
5|$|Adephaga {{contains}} about 10 families of largely predatory <b>beetles,</b> includes ground <b>beetles</b> (Carabidae), water <b>beetles</b> (Dytiscidae) and whirligig <b>beetles</b> (Gyrinidae). In these insects, the testes are tubular {{and the first}} abdominal sternum (a plate of the exoskeleton) is divided by the hind coxae (the basal joints of the <b>beetle's</b> legs).|$|R
5000|$|The pygora <b>beetles</b> or flower <b>beetles</b> are scarab <b>beetles</b> of {{the genus}} Pygora. They are native to Madagascar.|$|R
5|$|Some longhorn <b>beetles</b> (Cerambycidae) are {{effective}} Batesian mimics of wasps. <b>Beetles</b> may combine coloration with behavioural mimicry, acting like the wasps they already closely resemble. Many other <b>beetles,</b> including ladybirds, blister <b>beetles,</b> and lycid <b>beetles</b> secrete distasteful or toxic substances {{to make them}} unpalatable or poisonous, and are often aposematic, where bright or contrasting coloration warn off predators; many <b>beetles</b> and other insects mimic these chemically protected species.|$|R
5|$|Bruchus rufimanus, {{commonly}} known as the broad bean weevil, broad bean <b>beetle,</b> or broad bean seed <b>beetle</b> is a weevil which inhabits crops and fields, as well as some homes. It is a pest of faba beans (Vicia faba L.).The adult weevils feed on pollen, while their larvae tunnel in seeds destroying crops and moving on to new ones once they dry out. The adult <b>beetle,</b> being one of the biggest of its genus, ranges from 3 to 5mm in length.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War the Warsaw Pact countries, {{fearing a}} food shortage, decried the <b>beetle</b> as a CIA plot {{to destroy the}} {{agriculture}} of the Soviet Union. Officials launched a Warsaw Pact-wide campaign {{to wipe out the}} <b>beetle,</b> villainizing them in propaganda posters and pulling schoolchildren from class to gather the bugs and drown them in buckets of benzene or spirit.|$|E
5|$|Five Red Data Book {{invertebrate}} {{species have}} been recorded in the area. These include: the soldier flies Odontomyia ornata and Stratiomys singularior, hover fly Lejops vittata, the great silver water <b>beetle</b> (Hydrophilus piceus), and the water <b>beetle</b> Hydrovatus clypealis. Nationally scarce species include the aquatic snail Gyraulus laevis, the hairy dragonfly (Brachytron pratense), and the ladybird Coccidula scutellata.|$|E
50|$|There {{are about}} 300 Neuropteran, over 1000 Orthopteran, 150 {{cockroach}} and 1000 caddisfly species in Europe. The dipteran fauna consists of 12,000 species of Brachycera and 7000 species of Nematocera. Among over 20,000 Hymenopterans are 180 species of ants. About 25,000 species of <b>beetles</b> are recorded from Europe (including about 2600 ground <b>beetles,</b> 700 longhorn <b>beetles,</b> 1700 leaf <b>beetles,</b> 200 ladybird <b>beetles,</b> 5000 rove <b>beetles</b> and 5000 weevils).|$|R
