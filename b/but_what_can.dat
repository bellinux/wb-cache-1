25|$|Recto {{is not a}} good speaker, no. He will arouse no mob. But heaven {{help the}} one whose pretensions he chooses to demolish. His {{sentences}} march like ordered battalions against the inmost citadel of the man's arguments, and reduce them to rubble; meanwhile his reservations stand like armed sentries against the most silent approach and every attempt at encirclement by the adversary. The reduction to absurdity of Nacionalista senator Zulueta's conception of sound foreign policy was a shattering experience, the skill that goes into the cutting of a diamond went into the work of demolition. There was no slip of the hand, no flaw in the tool. All was delicately, perfectly done... Recto cannot defend the indefensible, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> be defended, he will see to it that it will not be taken.|$|E
25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E

500|$|Both Kanye West and Carlos Mencia responded {{within one}} day of the episode's {{original}} broadcast and said they enjoyed the parodies of themselves, although Kanye West said on his blog that his feelings were hurt. [...] After the episode was broadcast, Mencia wrote on his Twitter feed, [...] "They just made fun of me on South Park. I thought it was hysterical. Catch the rerun." [...] Dave Itzkoff, arts reporter for The New York Times, complimented Mencia for his response. West wrote on his blog, [...] "South Park murdered me last night and it's pretty damn funny.

[...] West thanked the South Park writers in his blog entry and acknowledged {{he has a problem}} with his ego, but said he was trying to change.

[...] Carlos Mencia, host of the Comedy Central show Mind of Mencia, was also spoofed in [...] "Fishsticks". He is portrayed as knowingly stealing credit for a joke he did not write, which is a reference to accusations other comedians have made that Mencia plagiarizes jokes from other people.

500|$|Arsenal played league challengers Newcastle United in {{the sixth}} round, on 9 March 2002. The timing of the game, {{influenced}} by the television schedulers, angered Wenger, who threatened to field a weakened side, to prioritise on their Champions League progress: [...] "The BBC have put us in this position of playing at 5.35pm on Saturday night instead of a noon kick-off. I don't know whether Newcastle would have played the game earlier on the Saturday <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> I do about the BBC? I feel it's being very unfair as {{we are the only}} side left in all three competitions." [...] It was the second meeting between both teams in a week, and in spite of Arsenal winning the first fixture and scoring the opener in the cup tie, Newcastle found [...] "new reserves of energy and determination" [...] to draw level and created numerous opportunities to win the game outright. With the game ending in a draw, a replay was scheduled two weeks later. Arsenal won 3-0, but more concerningly lost Pirès, who was carried off and subsequently ruled out {{for the remainder of the}} season with medial knee ligament damage. An own goal by Middlesbrough's Gianluca Festa, from an Henry free-kick in the semi-finals was enough to send Arsenal to their 15th FA Cup final.|$|E

2500|$|Next {{to nothing}} {{is known about}} his life <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> be {{inferred}} from his publication history and the music itself. [...] Records show that in 1565 he was maestro di cappella, the choirmaster and general music director, at the church of Santa Maria presso San Celso in Milan, at which post {{he would have been}} intimately involved with sacred music. [...] Unusually for a maestro di cappella who was a composer, he seems to have written no sacred music at all, or else none has survived. [...] His first book of madrigals was published in Milan in 1555, and his works continued to be published, reprinted, or printed in instrumental versions, {{until the end of the}} century.|$|E
2500|$|Little {{is known}} about his life <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> be read on the title pages of his publications, and found in a few records in cathedral {{archives}} in Lorraine. [...] In 1554, he was in Toul working as a choirmaster, as stated on the title page of two volumes of sacred music published by Parisian Nicolas Du Chemin. [...] However, he had a considerably earlier start as a composer, since some of his secular music had been published already in Lyon in 1539. One of these same songs was also published simultaneously in Paris, and attributed to the young Pierre Certon, a composer with a similar musical style {{as well as a}} similar name.|$|E

2500|$|Little {{is known}} of his life <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> be {{inferred}} from the dedications to his madrigal books. [...] He was born in Correggio in Reggio Emilia. [...] In 1575 he dedicated a book of madrigals to Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle, the Spanish Viceroy of Naples, and described himself as being in that man's service. [...] Whether he lived in Naples at the time, or elsewhere in the Spanish Kingdom of Naples, is not known. [...] Since his only publications after 1575 are reprints – in copious quantity – he may have died around that year. [...] Unusually for a popular composer of the time, {{he seems to have}} held no positions either in aristocratic courts or religious institutions for which records have been kept.|$|E
2500|$|By the mid-1990s, {{the stress}} of the {{constant}} filming and promotion of his films, as Van Damme explains, led him to develop a cocaine habit, on which he spent up to $10,000 a week, and consuming up to 10 grams per day by 1996. He was arrested for driving under the influence in 1999. Attempts at drug rehabilitation were unsuccessful, and he resorted to resolve his addiction via quitting cold turkey and exercise. In 1998, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In 2011, he discussed the condition on the British reality show , saying, [...] "Sometimes you're gonna like me, and sometimes you're gonna hate me. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> I do?

2500|$|Next {{to nothing}} {{is known about}} his life <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> be {{inferred}} by the treatise itself. [...] For a {{time he was a}} member of the monastery at Saint Jean de Réôme, in the Côte-d'Or near the present-day town of Moutiers-Saint-Jean. [...] Aurelian said in his treatise that he was a former monk of Réôme, but had been dismissed from the community for an unspecified offense; he wrote the treatise as a form of penance, both at the request of his colleagues who needed his specialized knowledge, and as an attempt to supplicate Abbot Bernard of St Jean de Réôme; whether or not he was admitted back into the monastery as a result of his writing is not known. [...] There is a record of an abbot named Bernard at St Jean de Réôme beginning in 846, who shortly afterward became bishop of Autun; this has helped establish the date for the treatise.|$|E
2500|$|While some brands {{welcome the}} support of the hip hop community, one brand that did not was Cristal {{champagne}} maker Louis Roederer. A 2006 article from The Economist magazine featured remarks from managing director Frederic Rouzaud about whether the brand's identification with rap stars could affect their company negatively. His answer was dismissive: [...] "That's a good question, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> we do? We can't forbid people from buying it. I'm sure Dom Pérignon or Krug [...] would be delighted to have their business." [...] In retaliation, many hip hop icons such as Jay-Z and Sean Combs, who previously included references to [...] "Cris", ceased all mentions and purchases of the champagne. 50 Cent's deal with Vitamin Water, Dr. Dre's promotion of his Beats by Dr. Dre headphone line and Dr. Pepper, and Drake's commercial with Sprite are successful deals. Although product placement deals were not popular in the 1980s, MC Hammer was an early innovator in this type of strategy. With merchandise such as dolls, commercials for soft drinks and numerous television show appearances, Hammer began the trend of rap artists being accepted as mainstream pitchpeople for brands.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1894, Alexander III {{died and}} Nicholas mounted the throne as Emperor. At the time, Nicholas had no children, thus {{according}} {{to the laws of}} succession of the Russian Empire, the Grand Duke George became Tsarevich (formally Tsesarevich, denoting the heir presumptive or heir apparent to the throne as opposed to any son of the Tsar, although the latter title fell into disuse in 1721 and was gradually supplanted by the more specific use of Tsarevich). George's ill-health had forced him to relocate to Likani. It was impossible for him to return to St. Petersburg for the funeral of his father, Alexander III. The doctors had forbidden it. Nicholas wrote to his brother, [...] "... constantly pray to God to send you a full and speedy recovery, and to comfort you, because it is so much more difficult to be alone after such great sorrow than it is for us who are at least together!" [...] George also missed the christenings of Nicholas' elder daughters, Olga and Tatiana. Shortly after the birth of Nicholas' third daughter, Maria, in June 1899, George wrote to his brother, [...] "I am terribly sad that I have not yet been able to see your daughters and get to know them; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> I do!
