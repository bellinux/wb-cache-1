40|$|In {{recent years}} {{numerous}} R 2 ̆ 6 D projects investigating {{potential of the}} Fertile Free Fuels (FFF) were carried out and reported. The main objective of these efforts is to investigate the potential of FFF to stabilize storage requirements of the long lived transuranium elements, to reduce the amounts and emissions of the spent fuel, as well as incinerating excess stockpile of Pu. The research effort is spread over a variety of reactor types, such as existing and evolutionary light water reactors (LWR) and emerging Generation IV reactor concepts. The reactor physics challenges of core and fuel cycle designs based on FFF are well known, reported in several publications and may be summarized as follows: •High concentration of thermal absorbers (Pu isotopes) degrades reactivity worth of control absorbers (soluble boron, <b>burnable</b> <b>poisons,</b> and control rods); •Absence of fertile component of the fuel modifies significantly the reactivity letdown curve, especially {{towards the end of}} the cycle; •Temperature reactivity coefficients are degraded, especially fuel temperature coefficient. Possible design solution to mitigate the problems listed above is a judicious application of <b>burnable</b> <b>poisons.</b> Various <b>burnable</b> <b>poisons</b> design and materials were investigated for a variety of fuel compositions and matrices. This work was aimed to perform a systematic evaluation of a potential of <b>burnable</b> <b>poisons</b> to address the design challenges related to FFF concepts for LWR 2 ̆ 7 s. As a reference design, a standard PWR fuel assembly design was chosen loaded with the reactor grade Pu (composition typical for a 50 MW/kg burnup) within MgO-ZrO 2 inert matrix. The BP designs investigated were based on WABA, IFBA, and Homogeneous poison/fuel mixtures. Main candidates of three BP materials: Gd,Hf, and Er were analyzed for each of the geometries listed above. Potential of a specific fuel/BP design to produce an acceptable candidate for a LWR cycle within a safety-related envelope of existing power plants was evaluated based on calculations of fuel load required to assure 18 -month inter-refueling interval, moderator and fuel temperature coefficients, and soluble boron reactivity worth. Analyses were carried out by an assembly level code – BOXER (1) and an application of a modified linear reactivity model for estimating full core performance parameters. Results of this work present a comprehensive analysis of the potential of BP utilization to address the design challenges of the FFF fuel cycles. In addition, conclusions derived from these results may be used as a guideline for an optimal choice of acceptable core and fuel cycle concepts References: 1. Paratte J. M., Grimm P., and Hollard J.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The {{elimination}} of soluble boron creates several advantages for Small Modular Reactor (SMR) operation. Most of these advantages are realized through significant core simplification (removal of pipes, pumping, and purification systems), {{the removal of}} the corrosive effects of soluble boron, and from improved safety effects. However, removing soluble boron creates its own set of specific challenges that must be overcome. Traditional pressurized water reactors employ soluble boron for uniform power suppression throughout the core. Thus any boron-free SMR design requires increased dependence on control rods and <b>burnable</b> <b>poisons,</b> where both are discrete neutron absorbers that locally impact the core where they are inserted. Since control rods are partially inserted, their presence negatively impacts the axial power profile and this distortion creates undesirable power peaks, leading to a reduced operating margin and a significant economic burden. Thus, the main challenge in any boron free design concerns excess reactivity suppression and active reactivity control while maintaining a proper axial power profile and reduced power peaks. The goal of the feasibility study is to investigate the physical effects of removing soluble boron, and to investigate and identify an effective strategy for containing power peaks in a boron-free SMR. Studsvik's CASMO- 4 E was employed to solve 2 -D Transport equation for infinite lattice analysis, and SIMULATE- 3 K was employed to solve 3 -D nodal diffusion equation for full core analysis. The study identified improved reactivity feedback mechanisms associated with the removal of soluble boron, arising from a softened neutron flux and a decreased production of plutonium. An analysis of strategies for soluble boron-free operation that involved axially grading <b>burnable</b> <b>poisons</b> and U²³⁵ enrichment percentages was found unable to be able to control the axial power profile throughout core lifetime. The inherent limitations in the lifetime of <b>burnable</b> <b>poisons</b> resulted in an inability to control the axial power profile through middle and end of cycle. Investigations of additional strategies involving an advanced control rod algorithm produced significantly improved results that met the prescribed criteria for success. The advanced control rod algorithm is thus recognized as a viable strategy for boron-free operation for SMRs...|$|R

50|$|To control {{large amounts}} of excess fuel {{reactivity}} without control rods, burnable poisons are loaded into the core. Burnable poisons are materials that have a high neutron absorption cross section that are converted into materials of relatively low absorption cross section {{as the result of}} neutron absorption. Due to the burn-up of the poison material, the negative reactivity of the <b>burnable</b> <b>poison</b> decreases over core life. Ideally, these poisons should decrease their negative reactivity at the same rate that the fuel's excess positive reactivity is depleted. Fixed burnable poisons are generally used in the form of compounds of boron or gadolinium that are shaped into separate lattice pins or plates, or introduced as additives to the fuel. Since they can usually be distributed more uniformly than control rods, these poisons are less disruptive to the core's power distribution. Fixed burnable poisons may also be discretely loaded in specific locations in the core in order to shape or control flux profiles to prevent excessive flux and power peaking near certain regions of the reactor. Current practice however is to use fixed non-burnable poisons in this service.|$|E

A major {{focus has been on}} the benefit of using <b>burnable</b> <b>poison</b> in conjunction with low-leakage fuel management schemes. Key features in the methodology, such as power weighting of batch reactivity values and correlation of neutron leakage effects with peripheral assembly power, were verified against results generated using detailed state-of the- art computer analyses. A relation between batch power fraction and batch reactivity was derived from a 1 / 2 -group diffusion theory model, and similarly validated. These prescriptions have been used in two ways: to develop analytical models which allow quick scoping calculations; and, programmed into a code, to facilitate more rigorous applications.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{utilizing}} thorium together with gadolinium, erbium, or boron burnable absorber in BWR fuel assemblies {{for very long}} cycle is investigated. Nuclear characteristics such as reactivity and power distributions are evaluated using CASMO- 4. Without thorium, {{the results show that}} gadolinium enriched in Gd- 157 has the lowest reactivity swing throughout the cycle. However, the local peaking factor (LPF) in the assembly at beginning-of-life (BOL) is high. The erbium case shows more reactivity swing but the LPF is lowest of all three cases. B 4 C case has the highest reactivity at BOL which would have to be suppressed by control rods. The most important advantage of B 4 C over others is the saving of uranium inventory needed to achieve the target exposure of 15 effective full power years (EFPY). Further analysis for transient conditions must be performed to ensure meeting all transient limits. Use of thorium in place of some <b>burnable</b> <b>poison</b> makes it possible to save some uranium enrichment while achieving equivalent discharge burnup to the case without thorium, but only by about 1 %. The benefit is small because almost the same amount of <b>burnable</b> <b>poison</b> is always required for suppressing excess reactivity throughout the cycle. Since Th- 232 functions more like U- 238 than <b>burnable</b> <b>poison,</b> this limits the allowed thorium to extend discharge burnup. Since all fuel assembly designs in this study have the same target exposure of 15 EFPY, the economic performance of each design can be compared based on the amount and enrichment of both uranium and burnable absorbers for each fuel design.

The overall cost of gadolinium and erbium cases are concluded to be about the same when large uncertainties are considered. by Yuichiro Inoue. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Plutonium loading in a plutonium–thorium (Pu–Th) {{mixed oxide}} (MOX) fuelled {{pressurized}} water reactor (PWR) core is typically constrained by large maximum radial form factors (RFF) and positive moderator temperature coefficient (MTC). The large form factors in higher Pu content fuels stem from the large differences in burnup, and thus reactivity, between fresh and burnt fuel, while positive MTC can potentially {{be the result of}} the high soluble boron concentrations needed to maintain criticality for such reactive fuel. The conventional solution to these problems is the use of <b>burnable</b> <b>poisons</b> (BPs). While BPs are able to reduce RFF, the positive MTC is not entirely due to a large critical boron concentration (CBC) requirement. In fact, analysis shows a positive MTC in Th–Pu fuel is mainly caused by fissioning in the epithermal–fast energy range. A reduction in epithermal–fast fissioning through the use of certain BPs and the strategic employment of loading patterns that encourage leakage are more effective in attaining negative MTC, as a reduction in CBC has a negligible effect on MTC. This paper examines the contributions to positive MTC by isotope and energy and identifies characteristics of BPs that are able to mitigate positive MTC in a Pu–Th MOX PWR core.

40|$|Gadolinium odd {{isotopes}} {{cross sections}} are crucial {{in assessing the}} neutronic performance and safety features of a light water reactor (LWR) core. Accurate evaluations of the neutron capture behavior of gadolinium <b>burnable</b> <b>poisons</b> are necessary for a precise estimation of the economic gain due to the extension of fuel life, the residual reactivity penalty {{at the end of}} life, and the reactivity peak for partially spent fuel for the criticality safety analysis of Spent Fuel Pools. Nevertheless, present gadolinium odd isotopes neutron cross sections are somehow dated and poorly investigated in the high sensitivity thermal energy region and are available with an uncertainty which is too high in comparison to the present day typical industrial standards and needs. This article shows how the most recent gadolinium cross sections evaluations appear inadequate to provide accurate criticality calculations for a system with gadolinium fuel pins. In this article, a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis (S/U) has been performed to investigate the effect of gadolinium odd isotopes nuclear cross sections data on the multiplication factor of some LWR fuel assemblies. The results have shown the importance of gadolinium odd isotopes in the criticality evaluation, and they confirmed the need of a re-evaluation of the neutron capture cross sections by means of new experimental measurements to be carried out at the n_TOF facility at CERN...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to use state-of-the-art nuclear and fuel performance packages to evaluate the feasibility and costs of a 48 calendar month core in existing pressurized water reactor (PWR) designs, considering the full range of practical design and economic considerations. The driving force behind this research is the desire to make nuclear power more economically competitive with fossil fuel options by expanding the scope for achievement of higher capacity factors. Using CASMO/SIMULATE, a core design with fuel enriched to 7 {sup w}/{sub o} U{sup 235 } for a single batch loaded, 48 -month fuel cycle has been developed. This core achieves an ultra-long cycle length without exceeding current fuel burnup limits. The design uses two different types of <b>burnable</b> <b>poisons.</b> Gadolinium in the form of gadolinium oxide (Gd{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }) mixed with the UO{sub 2 } of selected pins is sued to hold down initial reactivity and to control flux peaking throughout the life of the core. A zirconium di-boride (ZrB{sub 2 }) integral fuel burnable absorber (IFBA) coating on the Gd{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }-UO{sub 2 } fuel pellets is added to reduce the critical soluble boron concentration in the reactor coolant to within acceptable limits. Fuel performance issues of concern to this design are also outlined and areas which will require further research are highlighted...|$|R
