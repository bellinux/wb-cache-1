Labour turnover is a costly problem and an economic drain to <b>Brewing</b> <b>Industries.</b> Labour turnover costs <b>Brewing</b> <b>industries</b> in Nigeria huge sum of money in recruiting and training replacements. Additional costs are incured through new employees that are more subject to accidents, causes more breakages and make more errors than experienced worker. <b>Brewing</b> <b>industries</b> incur losses through reduced production, work disruption and increases scrap and over-time {{as a result of}} departed workers. A cross-sectional survey was utilized to collect data for answering research questionnaires and testing hypothesis in this research work.

The research finding showed that the effect of labour turnover were reduced production, increase cost of recruitment, work disruption, increased scrap and overtime and additional labour turnover. Reduced production was found to have the foremost effect on labour turnover and this affects output and profit. A comparison of the effect of labour turnover between Bendel Brewery and Guinness Brewery showed that Bendel Brewery rated increase cost of recruitment and training replacements as the major effect of labour turnover while Guineas Brewery rated reduced production.

5|$|Plant {{technology}} {{began to}} be turned {{to the problem of}} directly chilling rooms and containers, to replace the need to carry ice at all. Pressure began to grow for a replacement for ice bunkers on the trans-Atlantic routes during the 1870s. Tellier produced a chilled storeroom for the steamship Le Frigorifique, using it to ship beef from Argentina to France, while the Glasgow-based firm of Bells helped to sponsor a new, compressed-air chiller for ships using the Gorrie approach, called the Bell-Coleman design. These technologies soon became used on the trade to Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. The same approach {{began to be}} taken in other industries. Carl von Linde found ways of applying mechanical refrigeration to the <b>brewing</b> <b>industry,</b> removing its reliance on natural ice; cold warehouses and meat packers began to rely on chilling plants.|$|E

Scottish & Newcastle became the dominant force in brewing across Scotland and the North of England. From the 1960s, the company began to style itself MacEwan's in export markets, in order to make pronunciation easier. The company's McEwan's Strong Ale was the highest gravity beer on general sale throughout the world. McEwan's Export was alternatively sold as India Pale Ale or Scotch Ale overseas. William McEwan Younger retired in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Increasingly, {{however, the}} ice trade {{began to focus}} on {{supplying}} the growing cities on the east coast of the U.S. and the needs of businesses across the Midwest. The citizens of New York City and Philadelphia became huge consumers of ice during their long, hot summers, and additional ice was harvested from the Hudson River and Maine to fulfil the demand. Ice began to be used in refrigerator cars by the railroad industry, allowing the meat packing industry around Chicago and Cincinnati to slaughter cattle locally, sending dressed meat east for either the internal or overseas markets. Chilled refrigerator cars and ships created a national industry in vegetables and fruit that could previously only have been consumed locally. American and British fishermen began to preserve their catches in ice, allowing longer voyages and bigger catches, and the <b>brewing</b> <b>industry</b> became operational all-year around. As U.S. ice exports diminished after 1870, Norway became {{a major player in the}} international market, shipping large quantities of ice to England and Germany.|$|E

5|$|By the 1920s, in bottled form, Worthington {{was one of}} {{only three}} nationally {{distributed}} beer brands, alongside Bass and Guinness. Product rationalisation began after the Second World War and although Worthington occasionally overtook Bass in sales, the decision was taken to prioritise Bass products. Arthur Manners took the chairmanship of Bass in 1947, and was instrumental in driving the company forward. <b>Brewing</b> <b>industry</b> mergers from the late 1950s onwards damaged Worthington sales, as tied house ownership became increasingly concentrated with brewers intent on promoting their own products. At the same time, bottled beer sales suffered as drinkers in search of consistency opted for the new keg beers instead. In 1965, the original Worthington brewery was closed, although production of the Worthington beers continued, consisting of White Shield, Green Shield (a filtered version of White Shield) and the draught product, E. Worthington E became the main keg bitter offered by Bass from 1967, and it had become a leading bitter brand by the 1970s, boosted by the company's network of 11,000 public houses. Worthington E was replaced as Bass' leading keg bitter by Worthington Best Bitter in the 1980s, and by Worthington Smoothflow from the mid-1990s. In 2000, Bass was bought by the Belgian brewer Interbrew. The Competition Commission ordered Interbrew to divest itself of a number of its recently acquired brands, and Worthington was bought by the American brewer Coors, who later became Molson Coors in 2005. In 2004 Coors announced that they would no longer advertise Worthington on a large scale.|$|E
5|$|Technological {{advances}} proceeded in a {{range of}} areas. Watermills to grind grain had existed during most of the Anglo-Saxon period, using horizontal mill designs; from the 12th century on many more were built, eliminating the use of hand mills, with the older horizontal mills gradually supplanted by a new vertical mill design. Windmills began to be built in the late 12th century and slowly became more common. Water-powered fulling mills and powered hammers first appeared in the 12th century; water power was harnessed to assist in smelting by the 14th century, with the first blast furnace opening in 1496. New mining methods were developed and horse-powered pumps were installed in English mines {{by the end of the}} Middle Ages. The introduction of hopped beer transformed the <b>brewing</b> <b>industry</b> in the 14th century, and new techniques were invented to better preserve fish. Glazed pottery became widespread in the 12th and 13th centuries, with stoneware pots largely replacing wooden plates and bowls by the 15th century. William Caxton and Wynkyn de Worde began using the printing press during the late 15th century. Transport links were also improved; many road bridges were either erected or rebuilt in stone during the long economic boom of the 12th and 13th centuries. England's maritime trade benefited from the introduction of cog ships, and many docks were improved and fitted with cranes for the first time.|$|E

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsVincent R. Amanor-BoaduNationwide, {{the craft}} <b>brew</b> <b>industry</b> has enjoyed massive growth. Hops are an {{important}} ingredient in craft brew beer and rapid growth of this industry has created many opportunities to grow hops. Currently, hops production is concentrated in the Pacific Northwest. That is beginning to change with new hops acres being planted every year across the country. The study looks at how economically feasible it is to plant hops in Nebraska. Is there enough local demand? Finally, given that Nebraska’s weather is dramatically different than the Pacific Northwest, can hops flourish there? 	The research begins by assessing all costs associated with a starting a three acre hops operation. Estimated yield and income is projected for ten years to establish cash flow. Instances of hail, wind and tornados for Clay County Nebraska for the years 2006 - 2016 were calculated to determine a probability of those weather events occurring. The probability was then {{used to determine the}} effect it could have on yield of hops per year. In addition to cost of production, the study also documented the growth of Nebraska’s craft <b>brew</b> <b>industry</b> to establish demand for locally grown hops. 	The researched concluded that if production stayed constant and our discount rate at 5 %, assuming prices remain where they are or higher, then it is economically feasible to grow hops in Nebraska. Wind, hail and tornadoes do pose a threat in the Midwest but their effect on yield is not enough to deter someone from planting hops there. Access to reliable capital to begin and sustain a hops operation appears to have a greater impact. In addition, Nebraska’s craft <b>brew</b> <b>industry</b> continues to expand rapidly suggesting a strong market for locally grown hops. 	This information is important for anyone who is considering planting a commercial hops yard. Given how expensive the start-up costs are and how labor intensive the crop is, this research can provide guidance to those seeking to add hops production to their new or existing farming operation...|$|R
