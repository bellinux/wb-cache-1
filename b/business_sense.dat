5|$|Florence Harding became deeply {{involved}} in her husband's career, both at the Star and once he entered politics. Exhibiting her father's determination and <b>business</b> <b>sense,</b> she helped turn the Star into a profitable enterprise through her tight management of the paper's circulation department. She has been credited with helping Harding achieve more than he might have alone; {{some have suggested that}} she pushed him {{all the way to the}} White House.|$|E
5|$|Keating reaped {{benefits}} from the move to Arizona, a wide-open territory in both a physical and <b>business</b> <b>sense</b> that allowed someone a fresh start. He turned the now-renamed American Continental Corporation around, adding various operations and divisions in a structure somewhat reminiscent of American Financial. As chairman and controlling stockholder, Keating relied heavily upon family members, employing his son and four of his sons-in-law in prominent positions. Charles Keating III had a fast career rise within the company.|$|E

5|$|After it was shelved by Jive Records for two years, Miguel {{released}} his debut album All I Want Is You in November 2010. It sold poorly {{at first and}} was underpromoted by Jive, amid the label's dissolution. However, as its singles attained radio airplay and Miguel toured in its promotion, the album became a sleeper hit and helped him garner an audience and commercial standing. He also garnered a following with his fervent concert performances. After Jive was shut down and absorbed by RCA Records, Miguel acquired a new marketing team to develop himself {{as more than a}} typical urban artist, having felt pigeonholed into being marketed as one by Jive. He said that the experience of balancing creativity and <b>business</b> <b>sense</b> on his first album made him more confident in his approach on Kaleidoscope Dream.|$|E
5|$|In Malaysia, {{a similar}} price war caused {{controversy}} regarding {{sales of the}} book. Four of the biggest bookstore chains in Malaysia, MPH Bookstores, Popular Bookstores, Times and Harris, decided to pull Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows off their shelves as a protest against Tesco and Carrefour hypermarkets. The retail price of the book in Malaysia is MYR 109.90, while the hypermarkets Tesco and Carrefour sold the book at MYR 69.90. The move by the bookstores {{was seen as an}} attempt to pressure the distributor Penguin Books to remove the books from the hypermarkets. However, as of 24 July 2007, the price war has ended, with the four bookstores involved resuming selling the books in their stores with discount. Penguin Books has also confirmed that Tesco and Carrefour are selling the book at a loss, urging them to practice good <b>business</b> <b>sense</b> and fair trade.|$|E
5|$|When the Newmans {{win their}} lawsuit, Katherine decides to help Victor get Beauty of Nature back for Victor. In May 2011, Tucker {{ends up in}} a coma after being run down by a drunken Abby and Ashley takes the blame. Tucker signed a DNR but Katherine and Ashley keep Tucker from being taken off life support and Katherine is left in charge of McCall Unlimited. Tucker's living will also reveals {{that he has a}} son who stands to inherit 20 million dollars if he is found. Meanwhile, Katherine reverses all of Tucker's most recent {{business}} decisions and he and Ashley marry when he wakes up from his coma. Though Tucker is physically recovered, he lost all of his <b>business</b> <b>sense</b> and Ashley must run the company in secret until he recovers fearing Katherine may try to take his company again. Afterward, Tucker is one of several suspects when Diane is murdered and he fires Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), from his record label. In turn Katherine launches her own record label as a subsidiary of Chancellor Industries and hires Devon to run it. Tucker teams up with Jack again to overturn the sale of Jabot and a shocked Katherine ends up in the hospital after a stroke. Tucker accidentally learns from Jill that Devon is his son, and Devon refuses to accept Tucker as his new father, and disowns Katherine for hiding the truth. Meanwhile, Devon's formerly drug addicted mother, now known as Harmony (Debbi Morgan), returns to Genoa City to explain her reasons for hiding Devon's paternity. Tucker stands in as the godfather of Moses Winters, the son of his longtime friend and confidant, Sofia Dupre (Julia Pace Mitchell). Tucker does his best to build a relationship with his son, but Devon constantly rejects him. He and Ashley later renew their vows and Devon finally lets his guard down and comes to the wedding.|$|E
40|$|Social media {{data are}} {{becoming}} increasingly critical for businesses to capture, analyse, and utilise in a timely manner. However, the unstructured and distributed nature and volume of this information makes the task of extracting useful and practical information challenging. Given the dynamic evolution of social media and social media monitoring, our current understanding of how social media monitoring can help organisations to create business value is inadequate. As a result, {{there is a need}} to study how organisations can (a) extract and analyse social media data related to their <b>business</b> (<b>Sensing),</b> and (b) utilise external intelligence gained from social media monitoring for specific business initiatives (Seizing). This study uses a qualitative approach with a multiple embedded case study design to understand the phenomenon of social media monitoring and its outcome for organisations.

25|$|Despite his popularity, Wain {{suffered}} financial difficulty {{throughout his}} life.

He was easily misled, and occasionally found himself duped by the promise of a new invention or other money-making scheme.|$|E
25|$|Caruso biographers Pierre Key, Bruno Zirato and Stanley Jackson {{attribute}} Caruso's fame {{not only}} to his voice and musicianship but also to a keen <b>business</b> <b>sense</b> and an enthusiastic embrace of commercial sound recording, then in its infancy. Many opera singers of Caruso's time rejected the phonograph (or gramophone) owing to the low fidelity of early discs. Others, including Adelina Patti, Francesco Tamagno and Nellie Melba, exploited the new technology once they {{became aware of the}} financial returns that Caruso was reaping from his initial recording sessions.|$|E
25|$|A great {{boon for}} {{the economy of the}} village was the {{building}} of the Kennels in 1836 for the Duke of Buccleuch's pack. The hunting season brought many visitors and this led to the building of the Buccleuch Arms Hotel. At this time the local smiddy showed good <b>business</b> <b>sense</b> by moving from the east end of the village to the present location at the west end, in order, we can suppose, to be nearer the Kennels which, at one time, stabled as many as fifty horses.|$|E

25|$|After the war, Carnegie {{left the}} railroads to devote all his {{energies}} to the ironworks trade. Carnegie worked to develop several iron works, eventually forming the Keystone Bridge Works and the Union Ironworks, in Pittsburgh. Although {{he had left}} the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, he remained closely connected to its management, namely Thomas A. Scott and J. Edgar Thomson. He used his connection to the two men to acquire contracts for his Keystone Bridge Company and the rails produced by his ironworks. He also gave stock to Scott and Thomson in his businesses, and the Pennsylvania was his best customer. When he built his first steel plant, he made a point of naming it after Thomson. As well as having good <b>business</b> <b>sense,</b> Carnegie possessed charm and literary knowledge. He was invited to many important social functions—functions that Carnegie exploited to his own advantage.|$|E
25|$|In Chicago, Sun Ra met Alton Abraham, a precociously {{intelligent}} {{teenager and}} {{something of a}} kindred spirit. He became the Arkestra's biggest booster and one of Sun Ra's closest friends. Both men felt like outsiders and shared an interest in fringe esoterica. Abraham's strengths balanced Ra's shortcomings: {{though he was a}} disciplined bandleader, Sun Ra was somewhat introverted and lacked <b>business</b> <b>sense</b> (a trait that haunted his entire career). Abraham was outgoing, well-connected, and practical. Though still a teenager, Abraham eventually became Sun Ra's de facto business manager: he booked performances, suggested musicians for the Arkestra, and introduced several popular songs into the group's repertoire. Ra, Abraham and others formed a sort of book club to trade ideas and discuss the offbeat topics that so intrigued them. This group printed a number of pamphlets and broadsides explaining their conclusions and ideas. Some of these were collected by critic John Corbett and Anthony Elms as The Wisdom of Sun Ra: Sun Ra's Polemical Broadsheets and Streetcorner Leaflets (2006).|$|E
25|$|Peter Herdic {{moved to}} Williamsport in 1853, {{which was then}} a small village of 1,700 people {{surrounded}} by vast stands of virgin hemlock, white pine and various hardwoods. The lumber industry had existed in Lycoming County since the first Europeans arrived prior to the American Revolution, {{but it did not}} become the land-changing and eco-system altering industry until Peter Herdic and men like him arrived on the scene in the mid-19th century. The lumber era began in force in 1846 when the Susquehanna Boom, a series of cribs for holding and storing floating logs on the West Branch Susquehanna River was built under the leadership of James Perkins. Herdic was able to use his <b>business</b> <b>sense,</b> leadership abilities, and according to some questionable business tactics to rapidly acquire wealth by buying and selling several tracts of timber and several sawmills. He used his gains to purchase several tracts of land in Williamsport, more sawmills, and eventually the Susquehanna Boom.|$|E

His two hundred clients eventually included Charles Gounod, Jacques Offenbach, Adelina Patti, Mario, Clara Schumann, Antoinette Sterling, Edward Lloyd, Mr. and Mrs. German Reed, George Grossmith, Matthew Arnold, James McNeill Whistler and Oscar Wilde. Hesketh Pearson said of Carte: [...] "His acute <b>business</b> <b>sense</b> was aided by a frank and agreeable manner.... He took what other people thought were risks, but he felt were certainties.

40|$|English {{courts have}} held that clear words of {{incorporation}} of the arbitration clause (contained in the charterparty) are indispensable {{in the bill of}} lading, to bind consignees who had never witnessed the charterparty. This approach is for the protection of consignees as third parties. In this article, attention will be paid to the identification of problems relating to the form that a charterparty should have to be appropriate for incorporation. Whether charterparties can be superseded by other types of documents will also be examined. Last but not least, the author will critically assess the rules of construction followed in recent cases where ambiguous language has been used in incorporation clauses in bills of lading. In the last few months, three judgments have been issued which have produced highly controversial outcomes. The author asserts that the method of construction should not be considered as a distinct method from that of incorporation of clauses. Times have changed and, apparently, so has <b>business</b> common <b>sense.</b> However, ‘uncertain certainty’ has been caused because <b>business</b> common <b>sense</b> has been applied differently to judgments that have been issued with a couple of months difference...|$|R

500|$|One of {{the primary}} impediments in an AAFC-NFL merger was the {{supposed}} violation of [...] "territorial rights" [...] claimed by Marshall. [...] Eventually, Bell gathered enough support to effectuate a compromise with the AAFC. In late 1949, the leagues merged, and Bell would stay on as commissioner with his contract extended from {{five to ten years}} as three AAFC teams (the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, and Baltimore Colts) were subsumed. Seeking to capitalize on the publicity of the residual rivalry, he utilized [...] "exquisite dramatic" [...] and <b>business</b> <b>sense</b> and allocated the 1950 opening game to a contest between the 1949 champion Eagles versus the perennial AAFC champion Browns.

Sutcliffe concluded: [...] "A Momentary Lapse is Gilmour's album to much the same degree that the previous four under Floyd's name were dominated by Waters … Clearly it wasn't only <b>business</b> <b>sense</b> and repressed ego but repressed talent which drove the guitarist to insist on continuing under the band brand-name." [...] Recognising the return to the more music-oriented approach of Pink Floyd's classic works, Sounds said the album was [...] "back over the wall to where diamonds are crazy, moons have dark sides, and mothers have atom hearts".|$|E
50|$|A further {{judgment}} {{was given by}} Lord Collins, with whom Lords Hope and Mance concurred. Lord Collins, in his brief judgment, offered further thoughts on the approach to interpretation.
