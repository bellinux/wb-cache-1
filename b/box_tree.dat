5|$|The <b>Box</b> <b>Tree</b> is a {{restaurant}} located in Ilkley, West Yorkshire, England. It has been operated by chef Simon Gueller and his wife, Rena, since 2005. Under their management the restaurant has been redecorated, although elements {{from the original}} owners of the restaurant remain. Reception by food critics has improved over the years; the restaurant has a single Michelin star and three AA rosettes. A sister company is also run by the chef, called <b>Box</b> <b>Tree</b> Events.|$|E
5|$|The Guellers leased the {{restaurant}} from Avis in 2004. Within {{five months of}} re-opening it regained a Michelin star. Having been friends with Simon Gueller since they were teenagers, Marco Pierre White returned to {{the restaurant}} in 2007 in order to film segments for the ITV1 cookery reality television show Hell's Kitchen. White has aspirations to work with Gueller to return the <b>Box</b> <b>Tree</b> to its former status as a two-Michelin-starred restaurant.|$|E

In 1979 future multi-Michelin star chef Marco Pierre White began working at the <b>Box</b> <b>Tree</b> {{at the age of}} 17, under Reid and Long; he received his training at the restaurant. He later recalled in his book White Heat that the restaurant made him obsessed with food and he still considers the restaurant to be his spiritual home.|$|E

Of particular note is Lishman's of Ilkley, an award-winning butcher shop whose owner, David Lishman, became one of Rick Stein's superheroes in 2003. Ilkley is one of five towns to feature a Bettys tearoom and is home to the Michelin-starred <b>Box</b> <b>Tree</b> restaurant where Marco Pierre White trained. In 1991 Ilkley won the Entente Florale and in 1990 and 2004 the Britain in Bloom contest in the category of 'Town'. In 2006 Ilkley became a Fairtrade Town.|$|E

40|$|This study {{intends to}} present floristic-physiognomic {{investigation}} of <b>Box</b> <b>trees</b> (Buxus hyrcana) of the Farim area of Sari. All of {{species in the}} area were recorded by two methods field-walk and 60 releves with an area of 400 m 2 in a systematic-selective design in two elevation classes, more and less than 1200 m above sea level implemented. Our {{results showed that the}} flora of this region includes 47 families, 67 genera, and 77 species. Phanerophytes (37. 7 %), Cryptophytes (32. 5 %) and Hemicryptophytes (24. 7 %) were the most important structure groups of the local biological spectrum according to Raunkiaer method, and also with increasing elevation, portions of Hemicryptophytes and Cryptophytes increased and decreased, respectively. Chorological studies showed that chorotype form Euro-Sibria was the most important phytochorion in two habitats. The correlation of environment variables with two first axes of DCA showed that elevation of sea level and dominance average (canopy percentage) of <b>Box</b> <b>trees</b> had decisive role on the vegetation composition and mean richness of species (Hill N 0 index). Also, Jackknife estimation results confirmed that species richness in habitats with elevation more than 1200 m (75. 8 species) had a higher level compared to habitats with elevation less than 1200 m (58. 6 species) because of decreasing <b>box</b> <b>trees</b> dominance. Totally, {{the results of the present}} study not only confirmed the ecological capacity of <b>Box</b> <b>trees</b> in developing up to 1700 m in mountain forests of north Iran, but also the association of <b>box</b> <b>trees</b> with some plants of high regions with steep slope of north Hyrcanian forests such as: Acer mazandaranicum, Carpinus schuschaensis and Taxus baccata, can be introduced as two new syntaxa including Taxus baccata- Buxus hyrcana and Carpinus schuschaensis- Buxus hyrcana in Hyrcanian forests...|$|R
60|$|Now there {{shall be}} an oneness of {{judgment}} and understanding {{in the hearts}} of all saints; they shall be now no more two, but one in the Lord's hand (Eze 37:19-21). Alas! the saints are yet but as an army routed, and are apt sometimes through fear, and sometimes through forgetfulness, to mistake the word of their captain-general, the Son of God, and are also too prone to shoot and kill even their very right-hand man; but at that day all such doing shall be laid aside, for the knowledge of the glory of the Lord shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea (Isa 11:9,13). Which knowledge shall then strike through the heart and liver of all swerving and unsound opinions in Christ's matters; for then shall every one of the Christians call upon the name of the Lord, and that with one pure lip or language, 'to serve him with one consent' (Zeph 3:9). It is darkness, and not light, that keepeth God's people from knowing one another, both in their faith and language; and it is darkness that makes them stand at so great a distance both in judgment and affections, as in these and other days they have done. But then, saith God, 'I will plant in the wilderness,' that is, in the church that is now bewildered, 'the cedar, the shittah tree, the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, the pine, and the <b>box</b> <b>tree</b> together; that they may see and know, and consider and understand together, that the hand of the Lord hath done this, and the holy One of Israel hath created it' (Isa 41:19,20). And again, 'The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, and the pine tree, and the box together,' to beautify the house of my glory, and to 'make the place of my feet glorious' (Isa 60:13).|$|E
