500|$|On his 50th birthday, in 1906, Tesla {{demonstrated}} a [...] 16,000rpm <b>bladeless</b> turbine. During 1910–1911 at the Waterside Power Station in New York, {{several of his}} <b>bladeless</b> turbine engines were tested at 100–5,000hp.

Tesla did license the idea to a precision instrument company and it found use in the form of luxury car speedometers and other instruments.|$|E

60|$|The {{voice came}} from the farther end of a long, spacious room, {{surrounded}} with shelves, on which books and antiquities were arranged in scrupulous order. Here and there, on separate {{stands in front of}} the shelves, were placed a beautiful feminine torso; a headless statue, with an uplifted muscular arm wielding a <b>bladeless</b> sword; rounded, dimpled, infantine limbs severed from the trunk, inviting the lips to kiss the cold marble; some well-preserved Roman busts; and two or three vases from Magna Grecia. A large table in the centre was covered with antique bronze lamps and small vessels in dark pottery. The colour of these objects was chiefly pale or sombre: the vellum bindings, with their deep-ridged backs, gave little relief to the marble, livid with long burial; the once splendid patch of carpet at the farther end of the room had long been worn to dimness; the dark bronzes wanted sunlight upon them to bring out their tinge of green, and the sun was not yet high enough to send gleams of brightness through the narrow windows that looked on the Via de' Bardi.|$|E

5000|$|Barton Swift, Tom's father, {{was working}} on a new turbine design, which would {{increase}} performance of motors. Turbines are used all over the world today in the same way.

50|$|Coandă's {{research}} on the Coandă Effect was of interest post-war and {{became the basis for}} several investigations of entrained or augmented flow. A small stream of a high-velocity fluid could be used to generate a greater mass flow, at lower velocity. Although eventually unsuccessful for aircraft propulsion, this effect has been widely used on a smaller scale, from packaging machinery for small pills through to the Dyson Air Multiplier <b>bladeless</b> fan.|$|E
50|$|An aeolipile (or aeolipyle, or eolipile), {{also known}} as a Heron's engine, is a simple <b>bladeless</b> radial steam turbine which spins when the central water {{container}} is heated. Torque is produced by steam jets exiting the turbine, much like a tip jet or rocket engine. In the 1st century AD, Hero of Alexandria described the device in Roman Egypt, and many sources give him the credit for its invention.|$|E
5000|$|Vortex <b>Bladeless</b> S.L is a {{wind energy}} Spanish startup that {{was founded in}} 2013 by David Yáñez, David Suriol and Raúl Martín, {{exclusively}} dedicated to the development and marketing of Vortex. This multi-patented wind turbine without blades is able to capture the kinetic wind energy by 'vortex shedding' and transform it into electricity. The idea emerged in 2002 when David Yáñez, the inventor, saw a video of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge disaster and {{led him to the}} idea of a <b>bladeless</b> wind turbine. This new technology seeks to overcome issues related to traditional wind turbines such as maintenance, amortization, noise, environmental impact, logistics, and visual aspects. [...] In April 2015, Vortex relocated to Boston and formed a coalition with representatives from Harvard University, IDEO, TerraForm Power and Dat Venture. [...] The improvement of its product has been funded by Repsol Foundation Grant, Spanish Angels Investors and a loan from the Spanish government. Vortex also launched a crowdfunding campaign on June 1, 2015 to fund part of its commercialization. Currently, the company's focus is on the development of small wind products, with mass power generation devices planned for the future.|$|E
5000|$|Floor hockey {{equipment}} differs {{between each}} code. Some codes use an indoor puck, a ring made of felt or other material ( [...] Gym Ringette [...] ) while others use a lightweight plastic ball, or a heavier ball. Some codes require standard ice hockey, field hockey or bandy sticks, while others use lightweight plastic. In gym ringette plastic <b>bladeless</b> sticks are used while the Special Olympics version of floor hockey uses wooden ones. The types of checking and protective equipment allowed also vary.|$|E
5000|$|In {{its early}} years, the Perpetual Diet was {{a tool for}} {{consolidation}} of Habsburg power in the empire. However, {{by the middle of}} the 18th century, it was largely [...] "dysfunctional" [...] and a [...] "mere congress of diplomats" [...] that produced [...] "no important legislation in political and constitutional matters". [...] The weak institution has been called [...] "a <b>bladeless</b> knife without a handle", and, during the Diet's existence, the Empire increasingly became nothing more than a collection of largely independent states.|$|E
50|$|The {{material}} of R. tibetica {{included in the}} analysis came from Chinese sources. Later research showed that plants from Bhutan and southern Tibet which had previously been considered to be R. tibetica were actually a new species, R. bhutanica, which belongs to the Himalayan clade. There are few clear-cut morphological differences between the two clades; one is that compared to the Himalayan group, members of the Chinese clade have a larger number of <b>bladeless</b> leaves (i.e. leaves which have only a sheath forming part of the pseudostem).|$|E
5000|$|The {{equipment}} for the sport consists of a broomstick or mop handle used as a bat, and a solid rubber ball cut in half, though in urban halfball games a bisected pimple ball or tennis ball is often used. Half-rubber regulations call for a stick 48" [...] long, while halfball experts state 41" [...] long and 1¼" [...] thick as a standard. [...] In Boston a <b>bladeless</b> hockey stick is often used for a halfball bat, and special bats and pre-cut balls 2½-3" [...] in diameter are also manufactured for the sport.|$|E
50|$|Schoenoplectus lacustris {{grows up}} to 3.5 m tall, with stems 5 - 15 mm thick. Most {{of the leaves}} of S. lacustris are reduced to <b>bladeless</b> sheaths around the stem, but leaf blades up to 100 cm long can be formed under water. The {{inflorescence}} appears {{at the top of}} the stem, and comprises 3-10 branches, each of which is up to 10 cm long and may be again divided into shorter branches. The flowers are in the form of spikelets, each of which is 6 - 15 mm long by 3 - 5 mm wide.|$|E
5000|$|Roscoea wardii is a {{perennial}} herbaceous plant. Like {{all members of}} the genus Roscoea, it grows from a short rhizome, to which the tuberous roots are attached. When growth begins again, [...] "pseudostems" [...] are produced: structures which resemble stems but are actually formed from the tightly wrapped bases (sheaths) of its leaves. R. wardii reaches a height of 32 cm. There are three to five <b>bladeless</b> sheathing leaves with pink veins and two to three full leaves, 7-8 cm long by 1.7-4.5 cm wide. At the junction of the blade and sheath there are small transparent structures (ligules), 1-2 mm high.|$|E
5000|$|Roscoea bhutanica is a {{perennial}} herbaceous plant. Like {{all members of}} the genus Roscoea, it dies back each year to a short vertical rhizome, to which are attached the tuberous roots. When growth begins again, [...] "pseudostems" [...] are produced: structures which resemble stems but are actually formed from the tightly wrapped bases (sheaths) of its leaves. R. bhutanica is one of the smaller members of the genus; plants are 8-14 cm tall, with around four to eight or more leaves, the first two to four being <b>bladeless,</b> the others with smooth (glabrous) blades 4-21 cm long by 1-1.6 cm wide. The leaves are clustered together at the base.|$|E
