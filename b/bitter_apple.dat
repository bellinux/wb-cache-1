The work mentions the painkillers willow (leading ultimately to aspirin, she writes), autumn crocus and opium, which however is also narcotic. Many other substances that Dioscorides describes remain in modern pharmacopoeias as [...] "minor drugs, diluents, flavouring agents, and emollients... ammoniacum, anise, cardamoms, catechu, cinnamon, colocynth, coriander, crocus, dill, fennel, galbanum, gentian, hemlock, hyoscyamus, lavender, linseed, mastic, male fern, marjoram, marshmallow, mezereon, mustard, myrrh, orris (iris), oak galls, olive oil, pennyroyal, pepper, peppermint, poppy, psyllium, rhubarb, rosemary, rue, saffron, sesame, squirting cucumber (elaterium), starch, stavesacre (delphinium), storax, stramonium, sugar, terebinth, thyme, white hellebore, white horehound, and couch grass — the last still used as a demulcent diuretic."

They gather apples for the other islanders, only to discover that the island people have abandoned the mutiny and boarded their outrigger canoe, preparing to leave the island. Ishmael promises that he will save the islanders by sailing to a horseradish factory, but refuses to give them the apples, despite having already consumed one himself.

30|$|Botrytis umbel blight {{caused by}} Botrytis allii {{is a major}} disease that attacks onion crop. In vitro, Trichoderma viride, Penicillium chrysogenum, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and extract of <b>bitter</b> <b>apple</b> fruits (Citrullus colocynthis) showed {{antagonistic}} effect and inhibited the mycelial growth of B. allii. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of <b>bitter</b> <b>apple</b> fruits showed the existence of 37 compounds and their derivatives. Among them, 10 compounds constituted 58.66 % of the total analyses. Greenhouse experiment approved that the extract of <b>bitter</b> <b>apple</b> fruits was the most effective in reducing disease incidence and severity, followed by P. chrysogenum, when they were applied 2  days pre-inoculation with the pathogen. All treatments significantly increased the total phenolic contents than the untreated control, but the highest increase was obtained when S. cerevisiae and P. chrysogenum were applied. A positive correlation {{was found between the}} activity of bioagents and improvement of peroxidase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase enzymes in onion plants to resist infection with the pathogen. P. chrysogenum caused the highest increase in polyphenoloxidase activity in infected onion plants, while S. cerevisiae showed the lowest level of this enzyme. The study approved that application of the bioagents not only protected the onions against Botrytis disease but also enhanced the content of antioxidant compounds in onions. This encourages the application of such preparations to manage the production of onion crop, especially in the organic farming that bans the application of any chemicals.|$|E

It is true that these affections of the smell and taste, when they are in their full force, and lean directly upon the sensory, are simply painful, and accompanied with no sort of delight; but when they are moderated, as in a description or narrative, they become sources of the sublime, as genuine as any other, and upon the very same principle of a moderated pain. [...] "A cup of bitterness"; [...] "to drain the bitter cup of fortune"; [...] "the <b>bitter</b> <b>apples</b> of Sodom"; these are all ideas suitable to a sublime description.

Trichoderma viride, Penicillium chrysogenum, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were chosen as the best ones in each genus, based on the in vitro results. Bioagents were applied 2  days after inoculation with the pathogen by spraying 10  ml of each preparation (Hussein et al. 2007) supplemented with 1 % Arabic gum as a sticker (Ziedan 1998). The supernatant of <b>bitter</b> <b>apple</b> fruits (C. colocynthis) was taken as a standard solution (100 %) as described previously. Further, the extract was diluted at 5 % concentration.

All these we {{are apt to}} make {{subservient to}} the desire of praise; nor unwisely, when the praise sought is God's and the conscience's: but if the {{sacrifice}} is made for man's admiration, and knowledge is only sought for praise, passion repressed or affected for praise, and the arts practised for praise, we are feeding on the <b>bitterest</b> <b>apples</b> of Sodom, suffering always ten mortifications for one delight. And it seems to me, that in the modern civilized world we make such sacrifice doubly: first, by laboring for merely ambitious purposes; and secondly, which is the main point in question, by being ashamed of simple pleasures, more especially of the pleasure in sweet color and form, a pleasure evidently so necessary to man's perfectness and virtue, that the beauty of color and form has been given lavishly throughout the whole of creation, so that it may become the food of all, and with such intricacy and subtlety that it may deeply employ the thoughts of all. If we refuse to accept the natural delight which the Deity has thus provided for us, we must either become ascetics, or we must seek for some base and guilty pleasures to replace those of Paradise, which we have denied ourselves.|$|R
