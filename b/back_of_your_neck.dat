500|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asia and challenge Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States, saying: [...] "When I was in school , you never saw anyone who looked like us that was on TV. And that was really weird for me because there's so many people of South Asian descent in America – in the world. I didn't want to be this stereotype of what Indian people are usually seen as in global pop culture. We don't just have to be Apu from The Simpsons." [...] After being given all 26 pilot scripts which ABC was filming for the 2015–2016 television season, she chose Quantico. The actress, who had appeared in over fifty films at that time, was required to audition for the first time, which she found nerve-wracking. Safran was impressed by Chopra's audition, which helped him re-envision the character, adding [...] "She walked into the room, and it was like the molecules shifted in that way that superstars have. I was very confused because I didn't know who she was, but we all sat up straighter. We're like this is clearly a movie star; it's like every hair on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>neck</b> stands up watching her act. When I went back home I couldn't think about anyone else." [...] Chopra became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{returned}} to Rock's Plantation Studios in Hawaii in May 2003 {{to begin the}} first recording sessions for the album. Their intention was to record an album even more simplified than Gravity and even closer in sound to what they sounded like live, an overall different record. [...] "I think we all knew going into it {{that it was an}} important record for us," [...] said Duncan Coutts. [...] "I think that when you get more than ten years into a band, It has to be a rebirth for us. We didn't want to go and remake any of our past records." [...] In one month, they recorded 12 songs live off the floor, most in two or three takes each. Following these sessions, several of the songs including [...] "Walking in Circles", [...] "No Warning" [...] and [...] "Wipe That Smile Off your Face" [...] were premiered live. After touring concluded for the year, the band was set to finish the album that October in time for a January 2004 release. While satisfied with the recorded material at first, with time the band became more critical of it and decided they would only be demos. They felt strongly about the songs [...] "Picture", [...] "Will the Future Blame Us?" [...] and [...] "Angels/Losing/Sleep" [...] but felt {{that the rest of the}} songs didn't live up to them. [...] "Even though we loved the energy of what we'd done, not enough of the songs were making the hair stand up on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>neck</b> and so we realized that we needed to do more work," [...] bass player Duncan Coutts explained. They decided to postpone the album's release until June and then August to continue recording.|$|E

6000|$|You {{will all}} {{admit that there}} is neither romance nor comfort in waiting at your own or at any one else's door on a windy and rainy day, till the servant comes {{from the end of}} the house to open it. You all know the {{critical}} nature of that opening--the drift of wind into the passage, the impossibility of putting down the umbrella at the proper moment without getting a cupful of water dropped down the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>neck</b> from the top of the door-way; and you know how little these inconveniences are abated by the common Greek portico at the top of the steps. You know how the east winds blow through those unlucky couples of pillars, which are all that your architects find consistent with due observance of the Doric order. Then, away with these absurdities; and the next house you build, insist upon having the pure old Gothic porch, walled in on both sides, with its pointed arch entrance and gable roof above. Under that, you can put down your umbrella at your leisure, and, if you will, stop a moment to talk with your friend as you give him the parting shake of the hand. And if now and then a wayfarer found a moment's rest on a stone seat on each side of it, I believe you would find the insides of your houses not one whit the less comfortable; and, if you answer me, that were such refuges built in the open streets, they would become mere nests of filthy vagrants, I reply that I do not despair of such a change in the administration of the poor laws of this country, as shall no longer leave any of our fellow creatures in a state in which they would pollute the steps of our houses by resting upon them for a night. But if not, the command to all of us is strict and straight, [...] "When thou seest the naked, that thou cover him, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house."[13] Not to the work-house, observe, but to thy house: and I say it would be better a thousandfold, that our doors should be beset by the poor day by day, than that it should be written of any one of us, [...] "They reap every one his corn in the field, and they gather the vintage of the wicked. They cause the naked to lodge without shelter, that they have no covering in the cold. They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock, for want of a shelter."[14] ...|$|E
60|$|We got {{a splendid}} stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and caterpillars, {{and one thing}} or another; and we like to got a hornet's nest, but we didn't. The family was at home. We didn't give it right up, but stayed with them {{as long as we}} could; because we allowed we'd tire them out or they'd got to tire us out, and they done it. Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right again, but couldn't set down convenient. And so we went for the snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, {{and put them in a}} bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and a {{rattling}} good honest day's work: and hungry?--oh, no, I reckon not! And there warn't a blessed snake up there when we went back--we didn't half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left. But it didn't matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres. So we judged we could get some of them again. No, there warn't no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell. You'd see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they generly landed in your plate, or down the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>neck,</b> and most of the time where you didn't want them. Well, they was handsome and striped, and there warn't no harm in a million of them; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what they might, and she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it; and every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn't make no difference what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out. I never see such a woman. And you could hear her whoop to Jericho. You couldn't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs. And if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire. She disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes created. Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn't over it yet; she warn't near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings. It was very curious. But Tom said all women was just so. He said they was made that way for some reason or other.|$|E
