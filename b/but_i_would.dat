5|$|If {{you please}} Sir I am a widow; & I think it very wrong {{that there is}} not any Mrs. Fisher, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not marry Mr. Jeremy not for worlds, the way he does live in that house all slippy-sloppy; not any lady would stand it, & not a bit of good {{starching}} his cravats.|$|E
25|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{have you}} know, {{that the head}} of every man is Christ; {{and the head of the}} woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.|$|E
25|$|I {{think it}} will be a very long time. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say this. Will the time ever come when we can say Hitler's shadow is gone? I think, yes, it will come when Israel is {{accepted}} in peace with its neighbor states. But it doesn't look like it will happen soon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{returned}} Lord Foxham, [...] "lead on. I will, in some sort, {{follow you}} for shame's sake; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> own <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> were in bed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is what I {{concluded}} myself, Pierre; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{ask your}} opinion about it, for you have shown yourself a shrewd fellow.|$|R
6000|$|I was {{a little}} nettled at all this, {{particularly}} as the lake seemed to have buried the hatchet for that day; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> [...] "cheek it through." ...|$|R
25|$|I yield {{neither to}} Senator Borah nor {{to any other}} man in admiration of the Farewell Address and of the great Fathers of the Republic; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not use them as a cover for party politics. Never did I sneer at the Farewell Address; but I believe that the greatness of Washington was due to his looking the facts of his day in the face, and {{determining}} his conduct thereby, instead of by utterances, however wise of {{a hundred and fifty}} years before. I will trust the American people not to mistake short-sightedness for patriotism or narrow-mindedness for love of country.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} not {{completed}} {{at the time}} of Jordan's death on September 16, 2007. His widow Harriet McDougal and his publisher, Tor Books president Tom Doherty made the decision to have the book completed posthumously, with McDougal saying, [...] "I am sad to see the series end. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be far more distressed to leave it unfinished, incomplete and dangling forever." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{writing process}} took 18 months and Boyd was {{required}} to run synopses and drafts through the Fleming estate, a process he described as [...] "benevolent surveillance". The process was not always smooth, and the author {{had a number of}} arguments with the estate over the portrayal of Bond: [...] "they were concerned about Bond being seen as an assassin, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> argue Bond is sent on an assassination mission in at least four Fleming books", with further issues over Bond's relationship with M.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{always do}} when I take pains," [...] said Colville. [...] "The {{trouble is that}} I don't always take pains. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> to-night, in upon a lady." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{brother and}} I hope {{to call upon}} Mr. Fregelius and {{yourself}} as soon as possible, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not wait for that to have the pleasure of making your acquaintance." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> first <b>I</b> <b>would</b> find my empress. To me she {{was worth}} forty empires.|$|R
500|$|Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe {{believes}} that population increase still {{played a role}} and has stated that [...] "the forts provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress of an increasing population burst out into open warfare. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not see them as having been built {{because there was a}} state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction".|$|E
500|$|Vernoff {{offered her}} {{thoughts}} {{on the death of}} O'Malley: [...] "It's heartbreaking. I fell in love with George, like many of you did, in season one. He was impulsive, big-hearted, and yeah, it's that heart that had him jump in front of a moving bus to save a life. It's a devastating end to a beloved character, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> argue with anyone who said it wasn't a fitting end." [...] In the episode, Shepherd was offered the position of chief of surgery, but postponed his decision, due to Webber being his friend. Vernoff offered her insight on this: ...|$|E
500|$|Wilco {{signed to}} Reprise Records while Son Volt signed with Warner Bros. Records. Son Volt had an early college rock hit with [...] "Drown" [...] from the album Trace, but Wilco {{maintained}} a more commercially successful {{career in the}} years to follow. Regarding the possibility of a reunion, Mike Heidorn reported in a PopMatters interview that [...] "nothing's ever for sure, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have to say, 'No such thing'". Farrar said that he does not want the band to get back together, while Tweedy said that he believes that a reunion would not be productive musically.|$|E
5000|$|Ollie: No, because I don't have any, too bad. <b>But</b> if <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{have had}} them, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{definitely}} have teased them! ...|$|R
5000|$|... "In youth we all fantasize desperately. I {{could make}} myself believe many things then. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> never <b>would</b> have {{believed}} that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> become a professional photographer" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{observed}} {{three or}} four evil-looking rascals casting glances at the house today, {{and there are several}} rough-looking fellows hanging about the house this evening. I do not know if it means anything, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> let you know." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Bloodline" [...] aired the {{day after}} Fringes fourth season renewal was {{announced}} by Fox Entertainment, which came {{in the wake of}} various actors communicating directly with fans to watch the series. Actor Lance Reddick noted of the renewal, [...] "I know so often fans think that they need us... <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be digging ditches or something else if it wasn't for you. So — thank you. Really." [...] SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall was surprised but delighted by the network's decision, stating [...] "That any network, let alone Fox, had the patience and the faith to renew this show is, for me, little short of a miracle. It was a week, it seems, for wonders." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Shave Magazine, Ben Gibbard commented on his song writing saying that he [...] "never sit down to write an album number one. I just kind of sit down and write songs and the theme kind of makes itself apparent. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never say I was writing about searching for something as much as just trying to document with every song where I am in that moment when I’m writing that song. If a theme kind of makes itself apparent in a record, it {{has more to do}} with the fact that just what’s been on my mind recently. So I guess clearly I have been and was and am, but it was never a conscious decision." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{one last}} {{interview}} with Feletti—who again said almost nothing, citing a sacred oath—Carboni {{informed him that}} so {{far as he could}} see, there was no evidence to support his version of events. Feletti replied: [...] "I commiserate with the Mortara parents for their painful separation from their son, but I hope that the prayers of the innocent soul succeed in having God reunite them all in the Christian religion... As for my punishment, not only do I place myself in the Lord's hands, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> argue that any government would recognise the legitimacy of my action." [...] The next day Feletti and De Dominicis, the latter of whom had fled to the rump Papal States, were formally charged with the [...] "violent separation of the boy Edgardo Mortara from his own Jewish family".|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{take all}} for granted then, sir. You know <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>would</b> take your message, <b>but</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not engage to meddle further in it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Sorry folks, <b>but</b> if <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{have relied}} on the Fake News of CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, washpost or nytimes, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have had ZERO chance winning WH" ...|$|R
6000|$|The English {{astonished}} her, {{and somehow}} it daunted her, for the mask spoke very gravely; {{but she would}} not let him imagine that he had put her down, and she rejoined laughingly, [...] "Oh, I knew that you hadn't spoken, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> make you." ...|$|R
500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{gave it a}} {{slightly}} more critical review, awarded it a [...] "B". He compared the episode the third season episode [...] "A Benihana Christmas", writing that [...] "both deal with Michael’s heart being broken and the somewhat self-destructive ways he deals with it." [...] However, {{he felt that the}} episode [...] "struggles greatly if you have no emotional connection to Holly and Michael" [...] because it [...] "isn't funny, by any real stretch of the term, nor is it really intended to be funny." [...] He went on to say [...] "I like episodes like this one in general and don't necessarily need the show to make me laugh, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say that I wanted this hour to be slightly more... pleasant." ...|$|E
500|$|Three {{months after}} Chilton's death, Hummel {{died of cancer}} on July 19, 2010. Asked about the band's plans {{after the death of}} Chilton and Hummel, Stephens told Billboard, [...] "It's music we all really love to play, and we love to play it together, so we're trying {{to figure out a way}} forward where we can keep doing it." [...] In a Rolling Stone interview, Stephens said that the May 2010 tribute {{performance}} would be the group's final show as Big Star, although not his last show with Auer and Stringfellow, stating, [...] "I can't see us going out as Big Star... <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> hate to compound the loss of Alex by saying,'That's it' for Ken and Jon, too. I can't imagine not playing with them. There's so much fun—but an emotional bond there too." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2009, Sacramone briefly stayed in Los Angeles and {{designed}} for Tank Farm, a men's fashion company. She has discussed her intent to return to college in the media, but announced in August 2009 {{that she was not}} intending to return to Brown University. [...] "I plan to continue school, [...] I’m looking into transferring somewhere in Boston,” {{she said in an interview}} with Inside Gymnastics magazine. “Brown is a great school and I loved it, but it was just not the best atmosphere for me; maybe a little too liberal. It was a great two years, and I learned a lot about myself and from the professors and coaches there. I’m looking at Boston University, Boston College and Harvard. I want to weigh my options before I make an ultimate decision, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> love to transfer to Harvard. I think that would be pretty much ideal." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> when <b>I</b> <b>would</b> find rhyme for Rochfort, And look in English, French, and Scotch for't, At last I'm fairly {{forced to}} botch for't.|$|R
6000|$|... "October 11th.--The {{eleventh}} day of {{the month}} was the day (two months since) when we were married. He said nothing about it to me when we woke, nor <b>I</b> to him. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> make it the occasion, at breakfast-time, of trying to win him back.|$|R
60|$|At {{that she}} swayed, <b>but</b> when <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have caught her she motioned me away {{and turned to}} Antoinette. Twice Mrs. Temple tried to speak.|$|R
500|$|In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought another music {{publishing}} company, Famous Music LLC, formerly owned by Viacom. This deal {{gave him the}} rights to songs by Eminem and Beck, among others. In March 2007, Jackson gave a brief interview to the Associated Press in Tokyo, where he said: [...] "I've been {{in the entertainment industry}} since I was 6 years old, and as Charles Dickens would say, 'It's been the best of times, the worst of times.' <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not change my career ... While some have made deliberate attempts to hurt me, I take it in stride because I have a loving family, a strong faith and wonderful friends and fans who have, and continue, to support me." [...] That month, Jackson visited a U.S. Army post in Japan, Camp Zama, to greet over 3,000 U.S. troops and their families. The hosts presented Jackson with a Certificate of Appreciation.|$|E

D'Antonio stated, [...] "Currently, everyone is individually writing demos for the next Killswitch Engage record. There is no release date yet, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> assume it will be out early 2012." [...] Adam Dutkiewicz followed that up with a statement on the Killswitch Engage Facebook, saying [...] "YO! Its Adam D! We're about to begin writing our new record. Thanks to all of our fans for waiting so friggin' patiently...now let's turn on the [...] "riff faucet" [...] and RAGE!"

500|$|On 11 November 2008, {{marking the}} 90th {{anniversary of the}} end of the First World War, {{together}} with Harry Patch and Bill Stone, Allingham laid a commemorative wreath for the Act of Remembrance at The Cenotaph in London. Allingham was invested as a Scout on 18 November 2008, 100 years after he first joined as a youth. He said he was only able to spend six weeks with his local group as a boy. Allingham celebrated his 113th birthday on , at an event hosted by the Royal Navy. He received a signed birthday card from First Sea Lord Sir Jonathon Band and saw a Mark 8 Royal Navy Lynx flying overhead while he was sitting outside in his wheelchair. When asked the secret of his long life, Allingham said, [...] "I don't know, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say, be as good as you possibly can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I was," [...] he replied, [...] "so <b>I</b> was. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like a change. The Faubourg St. Michel {{appealed to}} me; {{most of my}} clients came to me from {{this side of the}} river--all those on the other side seem to know how to read and write." ...|$|R
60|$|Husb.--It is {{very kind}} in you, my dear, and I must always {{acknowledge}} it; <b>but,</b> however, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have you straiten yourself too much neither.|$|R
6000|$|Don. Louisa. Well, for all this, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{have sent}} him to plead his pardon, <b>but</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not yet awhile have him know of my flight. And where {{do you hope to}} find protection? ...|$|R
