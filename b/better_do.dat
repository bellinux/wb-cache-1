500|$|Smith {{graduated}} from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1991 {{with a degree}} in philosophy and political science. [...] "Went straight through in four years", he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. [...] "I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn't want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only chance {{to go to college and}} you had just <b>better</b> <b>do</b> it because some day you might wish that you did.' Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day." [...] After he graduated, he [...] "worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory".|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Blair's {{childhood}} sweetheart died in {{an accident}} {{at the age of}} 18; later, talking about her tragic loss, she commented: [...] "It made me realize I have to live... Having the boy I loved not anymore on this planet, I'd better live, I'd <b>better</b> <b>do</b> something".|$|E
2500|$|James Arness: An Autobiography was {{released}} in September 2001, with a foreword by Burt Reynolds (who had been a cast member of Gunsmoke for several years in the 1960s). Arness noted that he realized, [...] "f I was {{going to write a}} book about my life, I <b>better</b> <b>do</b> it now ... 'cause I'm not getting any younger." ...|$|E

2500|$|Catchers of the Peitz kind are scarce. [...] I {{know he is}} not a Beaumont on his feet, but he is a corking {{good man}} for a team because he always knows what to do and how to do it, and what <b>better</b> <b>do</b> you want? A catcher of the Peitz kind runs the whole game from behind the bat. I wish we had him, and if the Reds let him go it would be a serious mistake.|$|E
2500|$|Ebenezer Scrooge from A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, {{represents}} the perceived ideas of Malthus, famously illustrated by his {{explanation as to}} why he refuses to donate to the poor and destitute: [...] "If they would rather die they had <b>better</b> <b>do</b> it, and decrease the surplus population". In general, Dickens had some Malthusian concerns (evident in Hard Times and other novels), and he concentrated his attacks on Utilitarianism and many of its proponents, like Smith, and Bentham, whom he thought of, along with Malthus, as unjust and inhumane people.|$|E
2500|$|The stadium has had {{repeated}} {{problems with}} the grass surface, including the grass collapsing under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker during a week 6 game in 2015. This has led to concern that the stadium wasn't of a high enough caliber to host a high stakes game such as the Super Bowl. The {{problems with the}} turf were mentioned {{the day after the}} Super Bowl by Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib who said [...] "The footing on the field was terrible. San Fran (the 49ers) has to play eight games on that field, so they <b>better</b> <b>do</b> something to get it fixed. It was terrible." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{organizers}} of the Winter Soldier Investigation took several steps to ensure {{the validity of the}} participants. [...] Each veteran's authenticity was checked before the hearings by the investigation event organizers, and subsequently by reporters and Pentagon officials. In addition, they also gave specific details about their units and the locations where the events had occurred. [...] Those who wanted to testify were carefully screened by the officers of VVAW, and care was taken to verify the service records and testimony of the veterans. After the severe criticism of the accuracy of Mark Lane's book about atrocities a month before the event, the {{organizers of}} the Winter Soldier Investigation made the credibility of the participants a top priority. [...] As noted by one VVAW leader, [...] "The lesson is that we'd <b>better</b> <b>do</b> our work right. We'd better talk to these vets and weed out the bullshitters so that we can't get set up, because we're going to come under attack. [...] We're going to do this right." [...] All veterans participating in Winter Soldier were required to bring their discharge papers (DD-214's) and IDs.|$|E

40|$|U. S. Air Force {{pilots and}} control {{subjects}} participated in five experiments, {{each of which}} assessed {{a different type of}} visual–spatial ability. Although pilots judged metric spatial relations <b>better</b> than <b>did</b> nonpilots, they did not judge categorical spatial relations <b>better</b> than <b>did</b> nonpilots. Pilots mentally rotated objects <b>better</b> than <b>did</b> nonpilots, but pilots did not extrapolate motion, scan images, or extract visual features from objects obscured by visual noise <b>better</b> than <b>did</b> nonpilots. The results imply that efficient use of specific processing subsystems is especially important for, and characteristic of, pilots.
