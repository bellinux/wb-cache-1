The propulsion system was also found to be a secondary source of noise: poor design of the exhaust mufflers, weight-saving measures in the generator mountings, and an incorrect voltage supply to the <b>battery</b> <b>compartment</b> exhaust fans were noise-creating factors found and eliminated during studies by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation.|$|E

50|$|The AN/PVS-4 uses a 25mm screw-type variable-gain Image Intensifier tube. Operational voltage is 3.0 Volts. Early {{production}} models feature two circular <b>battery</b> <b>compartments</b> {{located on the}} main housing. These <b>battery</b> <b>compartments</b> are designed to accommodate one 3.0V BA-5567/U, or two 1.5V BA-3058/U simultaneously. Later designations such as the AN/PVS-4A use two common AA batteries (BA-3058/U) via a purpose-built adapter (PN A3009873) that attaches {{to one of the}} circular <b>battery</b> <b>compartments.</b> Use of the adapter negates the need for BA-5567/U and BA-3058/U. AN/PVS-4s still in use today are typically upgraded with the AA battery adapter even if they have not been upgraded to a third generation tube. Some AN/PVS-4A models made after 1984 feature an integral AA battery housing that does not require the use of an external AA battery adapter.|$|R

40|$|DHHS publication; no. (NIOSH) 97 - 149 This {{fact sheet}} {{detailed}} the possible explosion hazard associated with flashlights. Firefighters had flashlights explode in two incidents. Batteries {{commonly used in}} flashlights produce hydrogen gas. The buildup of pressure within <b>batteries</b> or <b>battery</b> <b>compartments</b> can cause the <b>battery</b> or <b>compartment</b> casing to rupture. Hydrogen and oxygen mixtures are highly explosive and, if ignited by a spark or excessive heat, can produce powerful explosions. Some <b>battery</b> <b>compartments</b> are sealed tight against air and water by design, prohibiting built up hydrogen gas to escape. In addition to potential injury, an exploding flashlight could touch off a larger explosion in a flammable atmosphere. Workers should read and follow manufacturer's recommendations for product use, should not mix batteries of different brands, should not mix old and new batteries, should not mix alkaline with nonalkaline batteries, should not use damaged batteries, ensure that proper polarity is observed when installing the batteries, and inspect the flashlight batteries prior to use in flammable atmospheres. The potential for explosion exists in any battery operated equipment. OtherOccupational Healt...|$|R

There were also little indentations in the saucer section where the light bulbs were to be placed. By the 1980s an ongoing series of revisions to the tooling to correct various inaccuracies, which unfortunately created a few new inaccuracies, such as a deflector dish that is far too small and nacelle caps which are shaped incorrectly. There was also a kit of the Klingon D-7 Battlecruiser ship seen on the TV show. It too was lighted in its first couple of issues.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The aim of {{this study}} is to model the thermal {{behavior}} of NiMH batteries powering electric vehicles. Both the thermal and the hydrodynamic fields in the <b>battery</b> <b>compartments</b> are predicted using CFD simulations. The model developed switches between laminar free convection and turbulent mixed convection according to the fans state of operation. Simulations are carried out for the discharge phase of the battery (i. e. vehicle run phase) by setting the ambient temperature to 20 oC. The study put an emphasis on the validation of the model by comparing the numerical results to the experimental data collected during tests performed on an electric vehicle in an environmental chamber. Results reveal that evolutions of the predicted temperatures in both front and rear <b>battery</b> pack <b>compartments</b> are in accordance with the corresponding experimental data.
