They are especially recognized for their function as plant growth regulators, {{but also for the}} important role in the biosynthesis process. Based on that, the aim of this work is to establish the influence of polyphenolic compounds, on the main physiological processes involved in basil cultivation under controlled conditions. Studies were carried out on sweet <b>basil</b> <b>seeds</b> (<b>Ocimum</b> <b>basilicum</b> L.) treated with different spruce bark polyphenolic extracts (aqueous extract and ultrasound assisted aqueous extract) on several concentrations. The germination energy and germination capacity, plants vegetative organelles development and photoassimilatory pigments content were investigated. The results show that the Picea abies extracts, rich in phenolic compounds, have an influence on the global development of plantlets.

40|$|Ayurvedic powders {{are widely}} used as {{therapeutic}} agents {{but most of them}} have unpleasant taste and large doses. One of the possible approach to overcome these drawbacks is to represent them in unit dosage form i. e. tablet dosage form. The {{purpose of this study is}} to elucidate and quantify the compressibility and compactibility of herbal granules prepared by using hydrogel isolated from whole <b>seeds</b> of <b>Ocimum</b> <b>basilicum</b> as a novel binder. The compressibility is the ability of the powder to deform under pressure and the compactibility is the ability of a powder to form coherent compacts. To test the functionality of novel excipients, Sonnergaard proved a simple linear model to confirm compactability, which is an uncomplicated tool for quantification. The tablets were compressed at increasing compression pressures and were evaluated for various mechanical properties. The linear relationship between specific crushing strength and compression pressure revealed the compactibility of the herbal granules and the linear relationship between porosity and logarithm of compression pressure revealed the compressible nature of the herbal granules according to the model developed by Sonnergaard.

40|$|Polysaccharide {{mucilage}} {{derived from}} the <b>seeds</b> of <b>Ocimum</b> <b>basilicum</b> L. (family Lamiaceae) was investigated for use in matrix formulations containing propranolol hydrochloride. Basil mucilage was extracted and several tablets were formulated. The effect of mucilage on drug release rate was evaluated in comparison with tablets containing two kinds of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC K 4 M and HPMC K 100 M) as standard polymer. The release data were fitted to several models for kinetic evaluation. The results showed that hardness decreased and friability of tablets increased as the concentration of mucilage increased. The rate of release of propranolol HCl from O. basilicm mucilage matrices was mainly controlled by the drug: mucilage ratio. Drug release was slower from the HPMC K 4 M and HPMCK 100 M containing tablets compared to the mucilage containing matrices than the drug release from matrices containing O. basilicum seed mucilage in similar ratios.   Formulations containing O. basilicm mucilage were found to exhibit suitable release pattern. The results of kinetic analysis showed that in tablets containing O. basilicm mucilage the highest correlation coefficient was achieved with the zero order model. The swelling and erosion studies revealed that, as the proportion of mucilage in tablets was increased, there was a corresponding increase in percent swelling {{and a decrease in}} percent erosion of tablets...|$|R

40|$|The {{etiology}} of {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) is not yet known, but many factors such as defects in the immune system, oxidative stress, microbial content in the gastrointestinal tract, nuclear factor (NF) -κB, nitric oxide (NO), cyclooxygenase- 2 (Cox- 2), and leukotriene B 4 (LB 4) are thought {{to play a role}} in its pathogenesis. In traditional Iranian medicine (TIM), several medicinal plants are thought to be effective for the treatment of IBD. In this study, information on all of these remedies were derived from all available old sources such as documents or notes and books and were added to the information derived from modern medical databases covering all in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials. For some of these plants, only one or two mechanisms of action have been found such as in Cassia fistula, Lepidium sativum, and Bunium persicum. However, for some plants various mechanisms of action are known. For example, Commiphora mukul is effective in IBD due to its immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties and it decreases NF-κB, NO and Cox- 2. Another herb, Plantago ovata, has immunomodulatory, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and wound healing activities and decreases NO and LB 4. Considering the mechanisms of action of these plants, the combination of some of them may be useful because of their many mechanisms of action such as Pistacia lentiscus, Bunium persicum, Solanum nigrum, Plantago ovata, Boswellia, Solanum nigrum, Plantago ovata and Commiphora mukul. For some of the herbal products used in TIM such as oleogum resin from Commiphora myrrha, <b>seeds</b> of <b>Ocimum</b> <b>basilicum,</b> <b>seeds</b> of Linum usitatissimum, gum resin of Dracaena cinnabari, seeds of Plantago major, seeds of Lallementia royleana, and seeds of Allium porrum, there is no or not enough studies to confirm their benefits in IBD.

However, mechanisms underlying the reported hypolipidaemic effect of this plant have not been investigated. This study evaluates the lipid lowering effect of aqueous <b>Ocimum</b> <b>basilicum</b> extract in Triton WR- 1339 -induced hyperlipidaemic rats. Hyperlipidaemia was developed in animals by intraperitoneal injection of Triton (200 mg/kg). After injection of Triton the animals were divided into three treatment groups: hyperlipidaemic, hyperlipidaemic plus herb extract and hyperlipidaemic plus fenofibrate treated rats. At 7 h after the Triton injection, levels of plasma cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol in rats treated also with the <b>Ocimum</b> <b>basilicum</b> extract (0. 5 g/ 100 g body weight) were, respectively, 50 %, 83 % and 79 % lower than Triton-treated rats and HDL-cholesterol was 129 % higher than in rats given Triton alone. At 24 h following <b>Ocimum</b> <b>basilicum</b> administration, total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol levels decreased by 56 %, 63 % and 68 %, respectively, in comparison with the Triton treated group and HDL-cholesterol was not increased significantly.
