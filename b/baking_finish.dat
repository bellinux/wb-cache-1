Art forger Eric Hebborn developed a technique and Tony Tetro discovered a way to use formaldehyde and a special baking process. [...] Craquelure is almost impossible to accurately reproduce artificially in a particular pattern, although there are some methods such as <b>baking</b> or <b>finishing</b> of a painting by which this is attempted. These methods, however, generally achieve cracks that are uniform in appearance, while genuine craquelure has cracks with irregular patterns.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Cotton fabric {{was treated}} by {{chitosan}} and epoxy-silicone finishing agents {{to improve its}} wrinkle-resistant property. The study showed that mixed finish by two agents can provide higher wrinkle-resistance than single finish when applied to the cotton fabrics due to their synergistic effect. In the wrinkle-resistant finishing process, four main factors (chitosan mass concentration, organosilicon volume concentration, baking temperature and <b>baking</b> time) influencing <b>finish</b> effect were discussed and then process conditions were determined. After optimum process treatment, the wrinkle-recovery angle of mixed finished cotton fabric increased evidently while its whiteness and breaking strength dropped a little. In addition, the addition of organosilicon can improve fabric softness. After washed for 30 times, delay wrinkle-recovery angle of mixed finished fabric was 54 ° {{higher than that of}} native fabric, and the treated cotton exhibited good washing resistance...|$|R
40|$|Time cues are {{ubiquitous}} {{in language and}} the ability to interpret them is essential for understanding events during discourse comprehension. Temporal markers that signal ongoing versus completed events, like the progressive and simple past tense, prompt distinct mental event representations. However, the detailed properties of ongoing event representations remain unexplored. Drawing from both the simulation and semantic association approaches to knowledge representation, this study examines the novel prediction that ongoing events engender incremental discourse representation updating processes. Experimental sentences cued either early or late phases of an ongoing event (e. g. Alice had recently started/almost <b>finished</b> <b>baking</b> a cake). Targets in a post-sentential lexical decision task were strongly associated with either early or late event phases (e. g. EGGS/AROMA). Facilitation priming was predicted for congruent sentence-target pairs, however, priming was found for the early event phase exclusively. The results have implications for models of knowledge representation, theories of semantic priming, and discourse model updating...|$|R
5000|$|Most bare {{cast-iron}} {{pots and}} pans are cast as {{a single piece of}} metal, including the handle. This allows them to be used on both the stovetop and in the oven. Many recipes call for the use of a cast-iron skillet or pot, especially so that the dish can be initially seared or fried on the stovetop then transferred into the oven, pan and all, to <b>finish</b> <b>baking.</b> Likewise, cast-iron skillets can double as baking dishes. Cornbread in particular is seen as a food item that is best prepared in a cast-iron skillet: the iron pan is heated beforehand in the oven, the ingredients are first combined and mixed in a mixing bowl, then added to the heated pan, and the dish is then placed directly into the oven for fast baking. This differs from many other cooking pots, which have varying components that may be damaged by the excessive temperatures of [...] or more.|$|R
5000|$|Giordano's stuffed pizza has {{received}} wide acclaim from critics, being named [...] "Best Pizza in the City" [...] by Chicago Magazine and [...] "Best Pizza in America" [...] by NBC's The Today Show. On Serious Eats, Daniel Zemans, praised the sauce {{used in the}} stuffed pizza for having a strong tomato and herb flavor, while noting the crust as a less enthusing yet suitable element of the pizza. Denise Du Vernay, {{in a review of}} several Chicago-area pizzerias for Patch.com, described the stuffed pizza at Giordano's as [...] "perfect" [...] and superior to the stuffed pizza offered at Aurelio's Pizza. In an article for the Christian Science Monitor, Giordano's was listed at fourth in a ranking of pizzerias in the Chicago area, with the article praising its stuffed pizza. The Rough Guide to Chicago said in 2003, [...] "Although most pizza parlors offer deep-dish, the following places have perfected it: Pizzeria Uno, Lou Malnati's ..., and Giordano's." [...] One criticism raised about the pizza is the time it takes for the pizza to cook, with a stuffed pizza having an average preparation time of up to 45 minutes. Diners can shorten this waiting period by ordering ahead or taking a half-baked pizza so they can <b>finish</b> <b>baking</b> it in their home oven. Giordano's was voted [...] "Chicago's Best Pizza" [...] by NBC, CBS Chicago, New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Chicago Magazine, Chicago Eater and Home & Garden Magazine. http://giordanos.com/about-us/ ...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the 0. 16 % xanthan gum addition in the recipe of the bread production and its influence on the baking and sensory quality of products was monitored {{during the process of}} our research. Prepared dough was inserted in the freezing box directly (- 18 °C) and it was stored for one, two, three, four, five and six months. When the <b>baking</b> process was <b>finished,</b> the products with xanthan gum and the products without it were compared and evaluated by both objective and subjective methods. It was found that freezing, cooling and storage of the products without xanthan gum addition influenced the volume, vaulting and general appearance of the products in a negative way and loaves of bread were evaluated as unacceptable after four months of freezing. The quality of experimental loaves of bread with xanthan gum was, even after six months of freezing storage, comparable with freshly baked products. Despite the freezing, the volume of the products had an increased value. After first month of freezing the volume increased by 28. 6 % and after two months of freezing it increased by 23. 8 % both compared to the control. The vaulting in products processed by freezing was in the required optimal level during the whole period of freezing. Sensory evaluation results of loaves of bread with xanthan gum were the best after three, four and five months of storage in a freezer, when 98 points were achieved. During the monitored period of freezing, the addition of 0. 16 % of xanthan gum markedly contributed to the preservation of sensory and baking quality of the frozen wheat dough. <!

40|$|The {{objective}} of the experiment was to verify the effect of propolis extract in Ross 308 broiler on the sensory quality of breast and thigh muscle modified by baking at temperature 200 ºC for 60 minutes and <b>finish</b> <b>baking</b> {{for a period of}} 10 - 15 minutes. In the experiment were used 180 chickens divided into 2 groups (control and experimental group) with 90 chickens (45 ♂ and 45 ♀). Fattening lasted 40 days. The chickens were fed   ad libitum with the same starter feed mixtures to 21 days and from 22 days of age through 40 days of age with the grower feed mixtures in the both followed groups. Feed mixtures were made without antibiotics and coccidiostatics. The feed mixtures used in experimental group were enriched with the feed extract   of propolis in a dose of 0. 2 g. kg - 1. After heat treatment of breast and thigh muscle   60 pieces chickens (30 pieces ♀, ♂ 30 pieces) of each group samples were sensory analyzed (smell, taste, juiciness, softness). Statistically significant differences were found by sex (P ≤ 0. 05 to 0. 001) in aroma and taste of cocks in the thigh muscle (+ 0. 290 points, + 0. 300 points) and hens (P ≤ 0. 01) in flavor (+ 0. 250 points) and softness (+ 0. 372 points) in breast muscle. Sensory assessment of the individual characters of either gender had significant differences (P ≤ 0. 05 to 0. 001) in favor of the experimental group achieved only in the evaluation of the smell in the breast (+ 0. 207 points) as well as thigh muscle (+ 0. 207 points). In the final evaluation the most valuable parts of Ross 308 chickens carcass were found a positive effect of propolis extract on their sensory properties, but significant differences (P ≤ 0. 01) were observed only in chickens in the breast muscle (+ 0. 917 points) compared with control group. The results have confirmed that propolis extract in a dose of 0. 2 g. kg - 1 feed mixture can be applied in the diet of chickens, as it positively affects the sensory quality of Ross 308 chickens meat, {{which is one of the}} most important parts of chicken meat for use in human food chain. doi: 10. 5219 / 158 </p...|$|R
