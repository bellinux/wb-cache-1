25|$|Sangiovese's high acidity and {{moderate}} alcohol {{makes it a}} very food-friendly wine {{when it comes to}} food and wine pairings. One of the classic pairings in Italian cuisine is tomato-based pasta and pizza sauces with a Sangiovese-based Chianti. Varietal Sangiovese or those with a smaller proportion of the powerful, full-bodied Cabernet blended in, can accentuate the flavours of relatively bland dishes like meatloaf and roast chicken. Herb seasoning such as <b>basil,</b> <b>thyme</b> and sage play off the herbal notes of the grapes. Sangiovese that has been subject to more aggressive oak treatment pairs well with grilled and smoked food. If Cabernet, Merlot or Syrah plays a dominant role, the food pairing option should treat the Sangiovese blend as one of those fuller-bodied reds and pair with heavier dishes such as steak and thick soups like ribollita and puréed bean soup.|$|E
25|$|Pepper {{gets its}} spicy heat mostly from piperine derived {{both from the}} outer fruit and the seed. Black pepper {{contains}} between 4.6% and 9.7% piperine by mass, and white pepper slightly more than that. Refined piperine, by weight, is about one percent as hot as the capsaicin found in chili peppers. The outer fruit layer, left on black pepper, also contains aroma-contributing terpenes, including germacrene (11%), limonene (10%), pinene (10%), alpha-phellandrene (9%), and beta-caryophyllene (7%), which give citrusy, woody, and floral notes. These scents are mostly missing in white pepper, which is stripped of the fruit layer. White pepper can gain different odours (including musty notes) from its longer fermentation stage. The aroma of pepper is attributed to rotundone (3,4,5,6,7,8-Hexahydro-3α,8α-dimethyl-5α-(1-methylethenyl)azulene-1(2H)-one), a sesquiterpene originally discovered in the tubers of cyperus rotundus, which can be detected in concentrations of 0.4 nanograms/L in water and in wine: rotundone is also present in marjoram, oregano, rosemary, <b>basil,</b> <b>thyme,</b> and geranium, {{as well as in}} some Shiraz wines.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 38 {{phenolic}} compounds in the solid/liquid extracts of five Lamiaceae spices such as rosemary, oregano, sage, <b>basil</b> and <b>thyme</b> {{were identified in}} the present study using LC-ESI-MS/MS.

Among them, the category of flavonoids was the largest with 17 compounds. Identification of the phenolic compounds was carried out by comparing retention times and mass spectra with those of authentic standards. In case of unavailability of standards, phenolic compounds were identified based on accurate mass of pseudomolecular [M-H]- ions and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data. The results of accurate mass measurements fitted well with the elemental composition of the compounds.

Seventy two Pekin ducklings distributed randomly into 3 groups of 24 birds each and sexed (12 ♂and 12 ♀) were used as followed: group I (control) fed a standard diet; group II – fed the same diet supplemented with the prebiotic Salgard at a concentration of 0. 15 %, and group III – fed the same diet supplemented with 0. 15 % of a herb mixture in an equal proportion (0. 03 % of each herb – rosemary, <b>thyme,</b> <b>basil,</b> oregano and cinnamon). At slaughter, material for histological examination was obtained from the ileum, the caeca, the liver and the kidneys of birds. Faecal content from the ileum and the caeca were submitted to microbiological analysis.

Air-dried samples had significantly (p < 0. 05) higher TP, rosmarinic acid content and antioxidant capacity than had freeze-dried and vacuum oven-dried samples throughout the storage period. Fresh samples had the lowest values for the parameters tested. Vacuum oven-drying resulted in higher TP and FRAP values in rosemary and thyme during 60 days of storage than did freeze-drying.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{antibacterial}} effects of several essential oils (EOs) alone and in combination against different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria associated with food products. Parsley, lovage, <b>basil,</b> and <b>thyme</b> EOs, as well as their mixtures (1 : 1, v/v), were tested against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium. The inhibitory effects ranged from strong (thyme EO against E. coli) to no inhibition (parsley EO against P. aeruginosa). Thyme EO exhibited strong (against E. coli), moderate (against S. typhimurium and B. cereus), or mild inhibitory effects (against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus), and basil EO showed mild (against E. coli and B. cereus) or no inhibitory effects (against S. typhimurium, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus). Parsley and lovage EOs revealed no inhibitory effects against all tested strains. Combinations of lovage/thyme and basil/thyme EOs displayed antagonistic effects against all bacteria, parsley/thyme EOs against B. cereus, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli, and lovage/basil EOs against B. cereus and E. coli. Combinations of parsley/lovage and parsley/basil EOs exhibited indifferent effects against all bacteria. The combination of lovage/basil EO showed indifferent effect against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and S. typhimurium, and the combination parsley/thyme EO against S. typhimurium. Thyme EO has the highest percentage yield and antibacterial potential from all tested formulations; its combination with parsley, lovage, and basil EOs determines a reduction of its antibacterial activity. Hence, it is recommended to be used alone as the antibacterial agent...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{the natural}} spices and herbs such as rosemary, oregano, and caraway {{have been used}} for the {{processing}} of meat products. This study investigates the antioxidant activity of 13 spices commonly used in meat processing plants. The hot water extracts were then used for evaluation of total phenolic content, total flavonoids content and antioxidant activities. Our results show that the hot water extract of oregano gave the highest extraction yield (41. 33 %) whereas mace (7. 64 %) gave the lowest. The DPPH radical scavenging ability of the spice extracts can be ranked against ascorbic acid in the order ascorbic acid > clove > thyme > rosemary > savory > oregano. The values for superoxide anion radical scavenging activities were in the order of marjoram > rosemary > oregano > cumin > savory > <b>basil</b> > <b>thyme</b> > fennel > coriander > ascorbic acid. When compared to ascorbic acid (48. 72 %), the hydroxyl radical scavenging activities of turmeric and mace were found to be higher (p < 0. 001). Clove had the highest total phenolic content (108. 28 μg catechin equivalent (CE) /g). The total flavonoid content of the spices varied from 324. 08 μg quercetin equivalent (QE) /g for thyme to 3. 38 μg QE/g for coriander.
