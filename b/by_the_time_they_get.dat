5|$|Batman, Robin and Batgirl {{decide to}} go after Freeze together. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> to the {{observatory}} where Freeze and Bane are, Gotham is completely frozen. Batgirl and Robin are attacked by Bane. They eventually defeat him by kicking apart his venom tubes, stopping the flow of venom to his body. Bane collapses before transforming back to his original diminutive size of Antonio Diego and is left helpless on the ground. Meanwhile Batman and Freeze begin to fight each other, with Batman defeating Freeze. Batgirl and Robin manage to unfreeze Gotham; and Batman shows Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl. Freeze learns that Ivy has betrayed him {{over the death of}} wife. Ivy blamed Batman for Nora's death, but she informs Batgirl that it was her idea. Freeze is angered by the betrayal and is informed by Batman that his wife is not dead; she is restored in cryogenic slumber and has been moved to Arkham waiting for him to finish his research. Batman proceeds to ask Freeze for the cure Freeze has created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome to administer to Alfred. Freeze atones for his misunderstanding by giving him medicine he had developed. Ivy is detained in Arkham alongside Freeze, who promises to torment Ivy during their sentence. After Alfred is cured, everyone agrees to let Barbara stay at Wayne Manor.|$|E
25|$|Hungry ghost realm (Preta): hungry ghosts {{suffer from}} extreme hunger and thirst. They wander {{constantly}} {{in search of}} food and drink, only to be miserably frustrated any time they come close to actually getting what they want. For example, they see a stream of pure, clear water in the distance, but <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> there the stream has dried up. Hungry ghosts have huge bellies and long, thin necks. On the rare occasions that they do manage to find something to eat or drink, the food or water burns their neck as it goes down to their belly, causing them intense agony.|$|E

An excerpt states, [...] "Pretty girls {{do not need}} a lot of education to marry into a rich and powerful family. But girls with an average or ugly appearance will find it difficult" [...] and [...] "These girls hope to further their education in order to increase their competitiveness. The tragedy is, they don't realise that as women age, they are worth less and less. So <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> their MA or PhD, they are already old — like yellowed pearls." [...] Originally at least 15 articles were available on its website relating to the subject of sheng nu, which have now been subsequently removed, that included matchmaking advice and tips.|$|E

50|$|Decision fatigue can {{influence}} irrational impulse purchases at supermarkets. During {{a trip to}} the supermarket, trade-off decisions regarding prices and promotions can produce decision fatigue, hence by the time the shopper reaches the cash register, less willpower remains to resist impulse purchases of candy and sugared items.

Florida State University social psychologist Roy Baumeister has also found that it is directly tied to low glucose levels, and that replenishing them restores the ability to make effective decisions.
