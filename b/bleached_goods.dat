40|$|Enamel microabrasion {{has become}} {{accepted}} as a conservative, nonrestorative method of removing intrinsic and superficial dysmineralization defects from dental fluorosis, restoring esthetics with minimal loss of enamel. However, {{it can be difficult}} to determine if restoration is necessary in dental fluorosis, because the lesion depth is often not easily recognized. This case report presents a method for analysis of enamel hypoplasia that uses quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) followed by a combination of enamel microabrasion with carbamide peroxide home bleaching. We describe the utility of QLF when selecting a conservative treatment plan and confirming treatment efficacy. In this case, the treatment plan was based on QLF analysis, and the selected combination treatment of microabrasion and <b>bleaching</b> had <b>good</b> results...|$|R
40|$|Poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) {{films have}} been electropolymerized from an aqueous micellar {{polyethylene}} glycol (PEG) based solution containing sodium poly(styrenesulfonate) (NaPSS) and lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate. On varying the NaPSS {{content in the}} electrode-position bath, two strikingly different nanostructured morphologies were obtained for ensuing PEDOT:PSS films and these have been correlated to the electrochemical and optical performance of the films. The films grown from the formulation with EDOT:NaPSS in a 1 : 3 weight ratio comprise of a nanoparticulate structure with a to date scarcely reported hexagonal structure. The film surface is also characterized by some unusual floral shapes encompassing elongated grains. TEM studies reveal that in the 1 : 3 film two dimensional (planar) PEDOT chains are stacked {{on top of each}} other with a vertical separation of 4. 63 Å. On the other hand the film generated from a 1 : 1 solution shows a texture wherein a random segregation of PSS particles is seen and this adversely affects the electrochromic response of the film.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{focuses on}} the effects of both thermal {{treatment}} (between 80 and 700 degrees C) and chemical activation (concentration of sulfuric acid between 0. 3 and 2 M) of natural Ranong kaolins (ground or not) from Thailand to remove the undesirable colour of rice bran oil. The mineralogical, physical and physicochemical properties of the initial and activated kaolins are discussed in relation with the bleaching effectiveness of the activated sample investigated. Generally, the greater the temperature used before the activation step and the concentration of sulfuric acid used during activation, the greater the structural degradation of the kaolinite; Al is removed from the octahedral sheet of kaolinite and amorphous SiO 2 dominates the samples. The measured maximum bleaching capacity is not necessarily obtained when using the activated kaolin having the highest specific surface area and pore volume; rather, the bleaching capacity is dependent on both alumina contents and proportion of kaolinite in the samples. Indeed, the partial preservation of the kaolinite structure is crucial to obtain a <b>good</b> <b>bleaching</b> capacity of kaolin in relation to the preservation of the aluminol sites which are likely {{to be involved in the}} adsorption of unsaturated molecules present in the rice bran oil. Moreover, as previously demonstrated, a partial leaching of Al from octahedral sheets of kaolin is also an important factor in order to obtain <b>good</b> <b>bleaching</b> capacities. Finally, the optimal preheating temperature and concentration of sulfuric acid which permit the best bleaching capacity of kaolin are reported...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to characterize exotic fruits (cambuci, araca-boi, camu-camu, jaracatia, araca) and commercial frozen pulps (araca, cambuci, umbu, coquinho, pana, native passion fruit, cagaita) from Brazil {{in relation to their}} bioactive compounds contents and antioxidant capacity. Camu-camu (Myrciaria dubia) presented the highest vitamin C and total phenolics contents (397 and 1797 mg/ 100 g f. w., respectively) and the highest DPPH(center dot) scavenging capacity. Coquinho (Butia capitata) also showed a significant vitamin C content (43 mg/ 100 g f. w.). Among the commercial frozen pulps, cagaita presented the higher DPPH scavenging activity and inhibition of beta-carotene <b>bleaching.</b> A <b>good</b> correlation between total phenols and DPPH scavenging activity was found for fruits (r = 0. 997) and commercial frozen pulps (r = 0. 738). However, no correlation was found for total phenols and inhibition of beta-carotene bleaching. Quercetin and kaempferol derivatives were the main flavonoids present in all samples and cyanidin derivatives were detected only in camu-camu. Camu-camu and araca (Psidium guineensis) showed the highest total ellagic acid contents (48 and 63. 5 mg/ 100 g f. w.). All commercial frozen pulps presented lower contents of bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity than their respective fruits. According to our results, camu-camu and araca might be sources of bioactive compounds.

50|$|From {{an early}} age Watt was very {{interested}} in chemistry. In late 1786, while in Paris, he witnessed an experiment by Berthollet in which he reacted hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide to produce chlorine. He had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles, and had published his findings, which aroused great interest among many potential rivals. When Watt returned to Britain, he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process. He discovered that a mixture of salt, manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine, which Watt believed might be a cheaper method. He passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali, and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have <b>good</b> <b>bleaching</b> properties. He soon communicated these results to James McGrigor, his father-in-law, who was a bleacher in Glasgow. Otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground/purposeFew studies {{investigated}} {{the best method}} for removing stains from different types of resin-based composite restorations and compared them to the more recently introduced nanocomposites. This study compared the effect of four methods for stain removal from composite resins; finishing with Sof-lex disks, using pumice and brush, bleaching with 10 % carbamide peroxide and 38 % hydrogen peroxide. Materials and methodsTwenty disk specimens were prepared. Specimens were immersed in a staining solution for 3 weeks. The stained surfaces of five specimens from each RBC material were treated {{with one of the}} treatment procedures. Colorimetric measurements were taken using spectrophotometer prior to and after staining, and then repeated after surface treatments. Color difference values were calculated. ResultsOne-way ANOVA indicated significant differences in color change of the three composite resin materials following staining. Filtek Z 250 showed the least susceptibility to discoloration followed by Renamel, Filtek Supreme was the material most prone to discoloration. Two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s Post Hoc showed that all stain removing procedures except polishing with pumice, were able to return Filtek Z 250 to clinically acceptable color difference. While bleaching with 38 % carbamide peroxide was not effective with Renamel. Only pumice and 10 % carbamide peroxide were able to return Renamel to clinically acceptable color difference. ConclusionCompositions of resin-based composite resins {{play an important role in}} their susceptibility to stain and their amenability to stain removal procedures.

This enzymatic stage (L) {{was followed by a}} chelating stage (Q) and then by a hydrogen peroxide stage reinforced with pressurized oxygen (Po), resulting to an overall LQPo sequence. The use of violuric acid was dictated by the results of a preliminary study, where the bleaching efficiency of various natural (syringaldehyde and p-coumaric acid) and synthetic mediators (violuric acid and 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole) were assessed. The outstanding results obtained with laccase-violuric acid system fulfil most of the characteristics of commercial dissolving pulp, totally acceptable for viscose manufacturing or CMC derivatives, with the added advantage that the enzymatic treatment saved 2 h of reaction time and about 70 % of hydrogen peroxide consumption, relative to a conventional sequence (Po) Postprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} work {{is on the}} determination of the properties of palm oil as potential base oil for producing bio based lubricants. The samples analysed were obtained from the open markets in the South West, South East and South South zones of Nigeria. Some of the physical and chemical properties such as viscosity, flash point, pour point, cloud point, specific gravity, acid number, noack volatility and aniline point were analysed. The samples were degummed, neutralised and bleached to remove the red colour (carotene) and gummy materials. The bleached samples were tested to determine the above mentioned properties. Comparison of the crude palm oil and the bleached samples with the conventional lubricants Mobil Super SAE 20 W 40 and Mobil gear oil SAE 75 W 90 was made. Finally, it was observed that the crude palm oil and the <b>bleached</b> sample exhibit <b>good</b> lubricating characteristics to be used as base oils for formulation of bio-lubricants.

40|$|A high final {{brightness}} {{is desired}} in most {{paper and board}} products. This requires bleaching processes {{that are able to}} produce high-brightness pulps. Mechanical pulps are widely bleached for high brightness using alkaline hydrogen peroxide with traditional sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate as additives. With high doses however, peroxide bleaching causes high organic loads in the mill effluent and anionic trash carry-over to papermaking. To alleviate the problems that arise from the use of sodium-based additives in peroxide bleaching, interest in the use of alternative magnesium-based chemicals has increased. In this study, a new, technical high-purity magnesium hydroxide-based bleaching additive was evaluated on laboratory-scale, pilot-scale and mill-scale experiments and trials for its ability to produce a high brightness in peroxide bleaching without the known problems of sodium-based chemicals. The key findings of this study include: a high brightening potential of peroxide bleaching using the Mg(OH) 2 -based additive, significant reductions (40 - 70 %) in all categories of environmental load, and cationic demand lowered by 60 - 70 % in bleached pulp with no loss in strength properties or in sheet bulk.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. A technologically feasible cottonseed oil-isopropyl alcohol (IPA) miscella refining process was developed to produce high quality cottonseed oil. Individual steps necessary to refine cottonseed oil-IPA miscella were determined and improved. These were: 1) homogenization of the cottonseed oil-IPA miscella with caustic solution; 2) centrifugation; 3) separation of miscella layers; 4) desolventization, 5) water washing and drying; and 6) bleaching. In neutralization, the miscella was mixed with 20 Be' caustic solution (50 % excess) by using a Sonolator for 15 times. The refined oils from both the bottom and top layers were water washed using 12. 5 % and 20 % (w/w) hot water, respectively.
