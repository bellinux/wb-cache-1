40|$|Issue: Glass is a hard, highly abrasive, and {{sometimes}} very sharp material {{which can cause}} excessive wear on ancillary processing equipment such as conveyors. Excessive wear can lead to costly downtime and higher maintenance costs, detracting from the economics of glass recycling. This Best Practice describes {{some of the issues}} to be considered before purchasing conveyors for glass processing systems. Best Practice: If glass-processing systems kept glass completely contained and within the equipment, most of the wear would be restricted to the actual crushing mechanisms. However, every system generates some amount of fugitive glass. Some of the fugitive glass is fine glass particles that can cause abrasion in moving parts like pulleys and bearings by contaminating lubricants and grinding down surfaces. Glass pieces also wedge into moving parts and fall below conveyor belts to build up over time, interfering with belt performance. In addition, post-consumer cullet contains beverage residue and moisture, which can cause it to stick to conveyor surfaces. The conveyor system must be designed to anticipate these occurrences. The following issues should be considered when designing a conveyor system. Cleats. A decision must be made whether or not to use cleated belts. If the cullet is wet or sticky, it may be preferable to use a belt without cleats, so a <b>belt</b> <b>scraper</b> can be installed {{on the underside of the}} conveyor. It is also easier to seal belts without cleats to prevent glass particles from falling off the conveyor. However...|$|E

40|$|In {{this day}} and age, {{employee}} health safety is an extremely important issue for companies. Along with maximising profits, companies such as Sims Metal Management want {{to provide the best}} working conditions possible for their employees and minimise the risks of injury or future health concerns. Companies must do what is reasonable and practicable to ensure this. Currently in the non-ferrous recovery plant, the dust levels are sometimes too high. This causes some issues, employees must wear uncomfortable dust masks all day and causes further discomforts. It settles on machinery and on the ground. Over time this dust builds up requiring extensive cleaning and production must be stopped. Dust also increase maintenance costs and reduces the life of machinery. To combat the dust the following were completed. A high pressure water system was used to slightly dampen stored material and suppress dust plumes when this material is unloaded from the bucket of a front end loader. A bag house dust suction system was installed to remove as much dust as possible without overloading the suction system. A vibratory screener was modified to filter out the finer material and remove as much dirt as possible before it travelled further down the plant spilling and vibratory feeds which usually cause dust particles to become airborne. Wider conveyor belts and additional skirting systems and <b>belt</b> <b>scrapers</b> were installed to reduce the spillage. The amount of car tires entering the plant was also reduced by rearranging the magnet setup to decrease load on metal sorters and allow an increase in the processing rates in the plant...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{performed}} at Vendig AB {{which is a}} company that develops and sells products such as <b>belt</b> <b>scrapers</b> for conveyor. The thesis is divided into two parts, one part where it´s investigated which tension force is required to tighten Vendig AB´s scraper Hampus against the belt in a correct way. The second part is called mechanical design and here a new and more compact tension device is developed. Field studies has been conducted at a couple of Vendig AB´s costumers to get a knowledge base about how Vendig AB´s products are used, how they function and the environment they operate in. During one of the field studies the force between the <b>scraper</b> and the <b>belt</b> was measured. The result from the measurements, together with a report from LKAB [1], were evaluated and summarized in a table. The required force was recalculated for all different version of the scraper. After the tension force had been investigated the old tension device was evaluated and a requirement specification for a new was compiled in collaboration with Vendig AB´s group of technology. A number of concepts where then developed using the concept generator tool SCAMPER. One concept conformed very well to the requirement specification and was further developed. The concept was dimensioned by simulations in CAD, and basic drawings were made. The design solutions where discussed with suppliers and the design was updated. Finally a prototype was ordered to test and evaluate the concept. The tests revealed shortcomings in the prototype which has been evaluated and solutions has been discussed...|$|R
40|$|In This Chapter [Finding {{the dust}} source Ventilation and dust {{collector}} malfunctions Upgrading the dust controls Design stage ventilation planning] This chapter explains {{how to reduce}} respirable dust 76 in hard-rock tunnels during excavation by using tunnel boring machines (TBMs). The first steps in combating a dust problem are to take dust samples to pinpoint the source, check the ventilation system, and check the dust collector. If the ventilation system and dust collector are operating properly, then other dust controls such as water sprays and conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>scrapers</b> must be upgraded. For tunnels in the design stage, recommended air quantities are provided. FINDING THE DUST SOURCE AND LOOKING FOR VENTILATION MALFUNCTIONS [The first steps in fighting a dust problem are to take dust samples to pinpoint the source, check the ventilation system, and check the dust collector. Without knowing the exact source, efforts to reduce dust are hit-and-miss (mostly miss). ] Taking samples to pinpoint the dust source. In tunnels {{with high levels of}} airborne dust, the first task is to pinpoint where the dust enters the airstream. Most dust originates from rock breakage at the tunnel face, but the location where this dust enters the airstream can vary. Dust can leak from behind the TBM face shield, from gaps in the ventilation duct, or from a mal-functioning dust collector. It can be entrained into the air from the muck on a moving conveyor belt. It can even be shaken loose from the underside of the belt as it passes over the idlers. As a start, to locate the dust source, dust samples and air quantity measurements should be taken at the following locations...|$|R
40|$|To {{address the}} {{problems}} of low selling efficiency, poor sanitation conditions, labor-intensive requirement, and quick rice cooling speed in manual rice selling in cafeterias, especially in colleges and secondary schools, this paper presented an Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) microprocessor-based rice-selling machine for cafeterias. The machines consisted of a funnel-shaped rice bin, a thermal insulation box, and a conveying and scattering mechanism. Moreover, this machine exerts fuzzy control over stepper motor rpm, and the motor drives the conveyor <b>belt</b> with a <b>scraper</b> to scatter rice, deliver it, and keep it warm. Apart from an external 4 * 4 keyboard, a point of sale (POS) machine, an ARM process and a pressure sensor, the machine is also equipped with card swiping and weighting mechanisms to achieve functions of card swiping payment and precise measurement, respectively. In addition, detection of {{the right amount of}} rice and the alarm function are achieved using an ultrasonic sensor and a beeper, respectively. The presence of the rice container on the rice outlet is detected by an optoelectronic switch. Results show that this rice-selling machine achieves precise measurement, quick card swiping, fast rice selling, stable operation, and good rice heat preservation. Therefore, the mechanical design enables the machine to achieve its goals...|$|R
