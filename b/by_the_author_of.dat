5|$|Originally {{published}} in serial form {{during the winter}} of 1834/35, Le Père Goriot is widely considered Balzac's most important novel. It marks the first serious use <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> characters who had appeared in other books, a technique that distinguishes Balzac's fiction. The novel is also noted as an example of his realist style, using minute details to create character and subtext.|$|E

5|$|Bar Hemingway was the {{favourite}} bar of Ernest Hemingway and is said {{by some to}} be {{the birthplace}} of the Bloody Mary cocktail which was invented for him. However, the claim is disputed as Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the drink in 1921 while working at Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates, rather than in the bar in the Ritz itself. The bar has been restored to its original appearance, with rich wood panelling and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> places and people that inspired him.|$|E
5|$|Railroad Gazette was a trade journal first {{published}} in April 1856 that focused on railroad, transportation and engineering topics. Master mechanics read and used the publication to share information about railway matters with one-another. An article in the publication documented what was purported {{to be the first}} locomotive run in the United States on a railroad, which was stated as performed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> the article. It also reported about the Erie Railroad's Rochester Division's electrification and about the opening of the Thebes Bridge. Railroad Gazette editors included Arthur Mellen Wellington and Matthias Nace Forney, and Horace Cleveland was an article contributor.|$|E
5|$|The Orkneyinga saga {{reports that}} Malcolm married {{the widow of}} Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Ingibiorg, a {{daughter}} of Finn Arnesson. Although Ingibiorg is generally assumed to have died shortly before 1070, {{it is possible that}} she died much earlier, around 1058. The Orkneyinga Saga records that Malcolm and Ingibiorg had a son, Duncan II (Donnchad mac Maíl Coluim), who was later king. Some Medieval commentators, following William of Malmesbury, claimed that Duncan was illegitimate, but this claim is propaganda reflecting the need of Malcolm's descendants by Margaret to undermine the claims of Duncan's descendants, the Meic Uilleim. Malcolm's son Domnall, whose death is reported in 1085, is not mentioned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> the Orkneyinga Saga. He is assumed to have been born to Ingibiorg.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of Jeremiah {{during and after}} the Exile was considerable in some circles, and three additional books, the Book of Baruch, Lamentations, and the Letter of Jeremiah, were attributed to him in Second Temple Judaism (Judaism in the period between the building of the Second Temple in about 515 BCE and its destruction in 70 CE); in the Greek Septuagint they stand between Jeremiah and the Book of Ezekiel, but only Lamentations is included in modern Jewish or Protestant bibles (the Letter of Jeremiah appears in Catholic bibles as the sixth chapter of Baruch). Jeremiah is mentioned by name in Chronicles and the Book of Ezra, both dating from the later Persian period, and his prophecy that the Babylonian exile would last 70 years was taken up and reapplied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> the Book of Daniel in the 2nd century BCE.|$|E

25|$|The terms used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> Deutero-Isaiah are {{reminiscent}} of certain passages in the Cyrus Cylinder: Traditionally, these passages in Isaiah were believed to predate the rule of Cyrus by about 100 years, however, most modern scholars date Isaiah 40-55 (often referred to as Deutero-Isaiah), {{toward the end of}} the Babylonian exile (c. 536 BC). Whereas Isaiah 1-39 (referred to as Proto-Isaiah) saw the destruction of Israel as imminent, and the restoration in the future, Deutero-Isaiah speaks of the destruction in the past (Isa 42:24-25), and the restoration as imminent (Isa 42:1-9). Notice, for example, the change in temporal perspective from (Isa 39:6-7), where the Babylonian Captivity is cast far in the future, to (Isa 43:14), where the Israelites are spoken of as already in Babylon. According to scholar R. N. Whybray, the author of Deutero-Isaiah (chapters 40-55) was mistaken for he thought that Cyrus would destroy Babylon but he did not. Cyrus made it more splendid than ever. But he did allow the Jewish exiles to return home, though not in the triumphant manner which Deutero-Isaiah expected.|$|E
