5|$|Cracks are linear {{openings}} {{that form}} in materials to relieve stress. When an elastic material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks {{meet at a}} node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form to relieve the stress. Further stress {{in the same direction}} would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not. In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.|$|E
25|$|Knots do not {{necessarily}} influence the stiffness of structural timber, this {{will depend on the}} size and location. Stiffness and elastic strength are more dependent upon the sound wood than upon localized defects. The <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> is very susceptible to defects. Sound knots do not weaken wood when subject to compression parallel to the grain.|$|E
25|$|After {{investigators}} recovered {{all four}} bolts, sleeves, and pins, {{they found that}} the parts that were not replaced were counterfeit and were incorrectly heat-treated during manufacture. Those bolts each could bear only about 60% of their intended <b>breaking</b> <b>strength,</b> making them less than practical to use on the aircraft. The fake bolts and sleeves wore down excessively, causing the tail to vibrate for 16 completed flights and the accident flight.|$|E
50|$|The joint is {{the weakest}} {{part of the}} system, {{therefore}} the type of joining method used is very important if strength is an issue. The strength of a joint {{is defined as the}} force required to break the strap in uniaxial tension. This is then compared to the uniaxial strength of the strap and recorded as the percent difference (e.g., a sample of steel strap may have a 5000 lb <b>break</b> <b>strength</b> and the seal may fail at 3000 lb, so the seal is said to have a 60% strength). Hot knife welds have a minimum <b>break</b> <b>strength</b> of 55%. Friction welds have a minimum <b>break</b> <b>strength</b> of 65%. Well set up strapping machines or friction weld tools will aim for around 80% of <b>break</b> <b>strength.</b> Metal clips/seals are surprisingly low with circa 100 - 120 kg slip resistance.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to injuries from falling and from back strains (some {{of which may}} be serious), catastrophic injuries may occur, such as finger, hand, or even arm amputations. Amputations or avulsions may result from two causes: looping or wrapping the rope around a hand or wrist, and impact from elastic recoil if the rope breaks. Amateur organizers of tugs of war may underestimate the forces generated, or overestimate the <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> of common ropes, and may thus be unaware of the possible consequences if a rope snaps under extreme tension. The broken ends of a rope made with a somewhat elastic polymer such as common nylon can reach high speeds, and can easily sever fingers. For this reason, specially engineered tug of war ropes exist that can safely withstand the forces generated.|$|E
25|$|They used {{spider silk}} fibers {{to create a}} nerve conduit with Schwann cells and acellularized xenogenic veins. The Schwann cells formed columns along the silk fibers in {{a short amount of}} time, and the columns were similar to bands of Bungner that grow in vivo after PNS injury. Spider silk has not been used in tissue {{engineering}} until now because of the predatory nature of spiders and the low yield of silk from individual spiders. It has been discovered that the species Nephila clavipes produces silk that is less immunogenic than silkworm silk; it has a tensile strength of 4 x 109 N/m, which is six times the <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> of steel. Because spider silk is proteolytically degraded, there is not a shift in pH from the physiological pH during degradation. Other advantages of spider silk include its resistance to fungal and bacterial decomposition for weeks {{and the fact that it}} does not swell. Also, the silk's structure promotes cell adhesion and migration. However, silk harvest is still a tedious task and the exact composition varies among species and even among individuals of the same species depending on diet and environment. There have been attempts to synthetically manufacture spider silk. Further studies are needed to test the feasibility of using a spider silk nerve conduit in vitro and in vivo.|$|E

2500|$|Drag {{systems are}} a {{mechanical}} means of applying variable {{pressure to the}} line spool or drive mechanism in order {{to act as a}} friction brake against it. [...] This supplies resistance to the line after hook-up to aid in landing the fish without the line breaking.

2500|$|With {{spinning}} reels, closed-face reels {{and conventional}} reels with star drags, {{a good starting}} point is to set the drag to about one-third to one-half the <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> of the line. For example, if the line is rated at [...] test, a drag setting that requires [...] of force on the line to move the spool would be appropriate. This is only a rule of thumb. For lever drag reels with a strike position, most anglers start by setting the drag at the strike position to one-third the break strength of the line. This usually allows the full position to still be safely under the line rating while providing flexibility during the fight. Depending on the conditions, some anglers may leave their reels in freespool then setting the anti-reverse or engaging the drag on hookup.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOrgan abscission {{in higher}} plants has {{invariably}} {{been characterized by}} higher activities of cell wall hydrolases in the abscission zone of the abscising organ, which facilitates degradation of middle lamella and loosening of cell wall of separation layers. The plant hormone ethylene has been implicated in the induction and progression of the abscission process. In the present study, we have measured activities of cellulase and polygalacturonase (PG) in the abscission zone of cotton (Gossypium hirusutum var RST- 39) leaf explants {{in the presence of}} ethylene. The effects of abscisic acid (ABA) and indole acetic acid (IAA) were monitored to elucidate the role of other phytohormones in the process of abscission. A several fold increase in cellulase and PG activities and decrease in <b>break</b> <b>strength</b> were observed in the LAZ of ethylene-treated explants. The increase in enzyme activities and decrease in <b>break</b> <b>strength</b> were strongly suppressed in the presence of 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) and IAA. ABA alone was found to stimulate enzyme activities and decrease the <b>break</b> <b>strength</b> though not to the extent of ethylene. 1 -MCP pretreatment of ABA and ethylene-treated explants showed significant inhibition in enzyme activities. It is concluded that cotton leaf abscission is ethylene regulated and characterized by increased activities of cellulase and PG in its abscission zone. ABA can induce abscission. However, it appears that ABA induced abscission may be mediated through ethylene...|$|R
