40|$|Abstract Background Most {{countries}} {{carrying out}} campaigns of bovine tuberculosis (TB) eradication impose {{a ban on}} the use of mycobacterial vaccines in cattle. However, vaccination against paratuberculosis (PTB) in goats is often allowed even when its effect on TB diagnosis has not been fully evaluated. To address this issue, goat kids previously vaccinated against PTB were experimentally infected with TB. Results Evaluation of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) secretion induced by avian and <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculins</b> (PPD) showed a predominant avian PPD-biased response in the vaccinated group from week 4 post-vaccination onward. Although 60 % of the animals were bovine reactors at week 14, avian PPD-biased responses returned at week 16. After challenge with M. caprae, the IFN-γ responses radically changed to show predominant bovine PPD-biased responses from week 18 onward. In addition, cross-reactions with bovine PPD that had been observed in the vaccinated group at week 14 were reduced when using the M. tuberculosis complex-specific antigens ESAT- 6 /CFP- 10 and Rv 3615 c as new DIVA (differentiation of infected and vaccinated animals) reagents, which further maintained sensitivity post-challenge. Ninety percent of the animals reacted positively to the tuberculin cervical comparative intradermal test performed at 12 weeks post-infection. Furthermore, post-mortem analysis showed reductions in tuberculous lesions and bacterial burden in some vaccinated animals, particularly expressed in terms of the degree of extrapulmonary dissemination of TB infection. Conclusions Our results suggest a degree of interference of PTB vaccination with current TB diagnostics that can be fully mitigated when using new DIVA reagents. A partial protective effect associated with vaccination was also observed in some vaccinated animals. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{real-time}} PCR assay for {{the measurement}} of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) mRNA in European badger (Meles meles) blood cultures was developed. The levels of IFN-γ mRNA in blood cultures stimulated with either bovine or avian tuberculin or specific mycobacterial antigens were compared with those in a nonstimulated control blood culture {{as the basis for}} determining the tuberculosis (TB) status of live badgers. The assay was validated by testing 247 animals for which there were matching data from postmortem examination and culture of tissues. Relative changes in the levels of IFN-γ mRNA in response to <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculin</b> and specific antigens were found to be greater among badgers with tissues positive for TB on culture. The test was at its most accurate (87 % of test results were correct) by using blood cultures containing <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculin</b> as the antigen and when the response to avian tuberculin was taken into account by subtracting the avian tuberculin response from the <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculin</b> response.

Three groups of 5 calves each {{were included in the}} experiment: one paratuberculosis vaccinated group, one paratuberculosis vaccinated and M. bovis infected group and one M. bovis infected group. The performance of the IFN-gamma release assay (IGRA) and the skin test using conventional avian and <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculins</b> (A- and B-PPD) but also other more specific antigens (ESAT- 6 /CFP 10 and Rv 3615 c) was studied under official and new diagnostic criteria. Regarding the IGRA of vaccinated groups, when A- and B-PPD were used the sensitivity reached 100 % at the first post-challenge sampling, dropping down to 40 - 80 % in subsequent samplings. The sensitivity for the specific antigens was 80 - 100 % and the specificity was also improved. After adapting the diagnostic criteria for the conventional antigens in the skin test, the ability to differentiate between M. bovis infected and non-infected animals included in paratuberculosis vaccinated groups was enhanced. Taking for positive a relative skin thickness increase of at least 100 %, the single intradermal test specificity and sensitivity yielded 100 %. The comparative intradermal test was equally accurate considering a B-PPD relative skin increase of at least 100 % and {{greater than or equal to}} that produced by A-PPD.

40|$|Although {{there is}} a wide {{consensus}} on the efficacy of paratuberculosis vaccination to limit economic losses, its use has been restricted because of its interference in the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Data from a vaccine clinical trial in the Basque Country (Spain) has been evaluated in relationship with bovine tuberculosis intradermal test results. The trial included two herds applying a Test and Culling strategy and five applying an inactivated vaccine. The vaccine was applied to animals of all ages present in each vaccinated herd when joining the trial, and then to all the replacers within their first three months of life. Yearly testing done with the comparative intradermal test (CIT) was applied to all animals older than 6 weeks. Between 2005 and 2011, the study generated 2, 033 records from Vaccinated Herds (VH) and 2, 252 from Test and Cull herds (TC). Pre-vaccination positive results rate was 2. 40 % among the 7 herds in the single <b>bovine</b> intradermal <b>tuberculin</b> test (BSIT). Two years later it rose to 20. 42 % in the VH and remained below at 0. 75 % in the TC. Applying the CIT reduced these rates to only 0. 58 % in the VH and to 0. 25 % in the TC ons. Regarding time since each animal joined the program, the proportion of positives to BSIT was variable and, in some cases, significantly different between time points. With regard to the age of vaccination, {{no significant differences were found}} between vaccination within the first year of life and afterwards. Vaccinated animals showed seventeen times more reactions than the non-vaccinated in the BSIT, but only four times more in the CIT.

40|$|Abstract Background Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (BTB) {{caused by}} Mycobacterium bovis continues to cause substantial losses to global agriculture and has significant repercussions for human health. The advent of high throughput genomics has facilitated large scale gene expression analyses that present a novel opportunity for revealing the molecular mechanisms underlying mycobacterial infection. Using this approach, we have previously shown that innate immune genes in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) from BTB-infected animals are repressed in vivo {{in the absence}} of exogenous antigen stimulation. In the present study, we hypothesized that the PBMC from BTB-infected cattle would display a distinct gene expression program resulting from exposure to M. bovis. A functional genomics approach was used to examine the immune response of BTB-infected (n = 6) and healthy control (n = 6) cattle to stimulation with <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculin</b> (purified protein derivative – PPD-b) in vitro. PBMC were harvested before, and at 3 h and 12 h post in vitro stimulation with <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculin.</b> Gene expression changes were catalogued within each group using a reference hybridization design and a targeted immunospecific cDNA microarray platform (BOTL- 5) with 4, 800 spot features representing 1, 391 genes. Results 250 gene spot features were significantly differentially expressed in BTB-infected animals at 3 h post-stimulation contrasting with only 88 gene spot features in the non-infected control animals (P ≤ 0. 05). At 12 h post-stimulation, 56 and 80 gene spot features were differentially expressed in both groups respectively. The results provided evidence of a proinflammatory gene expression profile in PBMC from BTB-infected animals in response to antigen stimulation. Furthermore, a common panel of eighteen genes, including transcription factors were significantly expressed in opposite directions in both groups. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that many innate immune genes, including components of the TLR pathway and cytokines were differentially expressed in BTB-infected (n = 8) versus control animals (n = 8) after stimulation with <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculin.</b> Conclusion The PBMC from BTB-infected animals exhibit different transcriptional profiles compared with PBMC from healthy control animals in response to M. bovis antigen stimulation, providing evidence of a novel gene expression program due to M. bovis exposure. </p...|$|E

The economic importance of the nonspecific reactor problem in South Africa is discussed. The cultural and biochemical characteristics and in some instances the virulence for laboratory animals of the 42 strains used in the investigation are given. The strains used were typical of the species they represented in these characteristics, except for the scotochromogen Hg 3. Details are given of the preparation of PPD sensitins from one strain of M. hovis, three strains of M. kansasii, two strains of M. fortuitum, two strains of M. phlei, two strains of M. smegmatis, six M. avium and avian-like strains, two strains of scotochromogenic mycobacteria, and six strains of unclassified mycobacteria probably belonging to a single species. The allergenic characteristics of the 42 strains of Mycobacteria and the twenty four sensitins were studied in guinea pigs. Specificity differences of the sensitins and sensitivity profiles of the strains are given. The sensitivity caused by various species of mycobacteria was found to be species specific, although varying degrees of cross sensitivity do occur between different species. Guine 1 pigs and cattle sensitized by all the species investigated except M. bovus is were more sensitive to avian PPD than to bovine PPD. It was shown that the specificity of the sensitivity caused by different species of mycobacteria is similar in calves and guinea pigs. Multiple comparative tests in naturally sensitized non-specific reactor cattle showed most of these animals to be more sensitive to avian tuberculin than to any of the other sensitins used in the investigation. The sensitivity profiles in these animals were similar to sensitivity profiles in guinea pigs sensitized by M. avium. This indicates that the most common cause of non-specific reactors in these herd was M. avium or avian-like mycobacteria. Field trials with Onderstepoort PPD tuberculins showed the comparative test to be more accurate than a test with <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculin</b> alone in differentiating nonspecific reactors and tuberculous animals.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (bTB) is a zoonosis causing {{economic losses}} {{and public health}} risks in many countries. The disease diagnosis in live animals is performed by intradermal tuberculin test, {{which is based on}} delayed hypersensitivity reactions. As tuberculosis has complex immune response, this test has limitations in sensitivity and specificity. This study sought to test an alternative approach for in vivo diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis, based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). DNA samples, extracted from nasal swabs of live cows, were used for SYBR® Green real-time PCR, which is able to differentiate between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium complexes. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the results of tuberculin test, the in vivo gold standard bTB diagnosis method, with real-time PCR, thereby determining the specificity and sensitivity of molecular method. Cervical comparative test (CCT) was performed in 238 animals, of which 193 had suitable DNA from nasal swabs for molecular analysis, as indicated by amplification of glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene, and were included in the study. In total, 25 (10. 5 %) of the animals were CCT reactive, of which none was positive in the molecular test. Of the 168 CCT negative animals, four were positive for M. tuberculosis complex at real time PCR from nasal swabs. The comparison of these results generated values of sensitivity and specificity of 0 % and 97. 6 %, respectively; moreover, low coefficients of agreement and correlation (- 0. 029 and - 0. 049, respectively) between the results obtained with both tests were also observed.

40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} {{caused by}} Mycobacterium bovis, is a chronic debilitating disease of mostly domestic cattle with infections {{reported in a}} wide range of domestic and wild animal species and also in humans. Due to its trade and public health implications, bovine tuberculosis is a controlled disease in many countries. The prescribed diagnostic test is the intradermal tuberculin test (skin test) which involves the evaluation of the host’s hypersensitivity reaction 72 hours after the intradermal injection of purified derivatives of mycobacterial proteins (<b>bovine</b> and avian <b>tuberculin).</b> Interpretation of skin test reactions is based on measuring the increase in skin thickness, as well as the subjective evaluation of any clinical signs observed such as edema and necrosis. The quality of the test outcome is highly dependent on the operator’s skills and experience in performing this test. Practical training of veterinary students in the correct execution and interpretation of the skin test is therefore a critical Day 1 competency. Live animal training for intradermal tuberculin testing is limited and no skin test models are commercially available. Therefore, bovine skin models made of dragon skin and platinum-cure silicon placed on aluminum clipper frames measuring 20 x 30 cm and covered with artificial hair were developed. Each of the five models represents a different common test outcome: edema, diffuse or circumscribed swellings, necrosis and adhesion of the skin. The models are used to evaluate the different skin reactions by palpation, measuring skin thickness, and visual evaluation. A step-by-step manual is available to guide students through the procedure and interpretation of the skin reactions.

40|$|This {{study shows}} that gamma {{interferon}} (IFN-γ) and interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) cytokine responses are produced by peripheral blood cells in cattle infected with Mycobacterium bovis. The different kinetics of the IFN-γ and IL- 4 responses to <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculin</b> and to ESAT- 6 following experimental intratracheal infection with M. bovis are described. An early increase in IFN-γ was observed that was maintained throughout the period studied. In contrast, the IL- 4 response was delayed and confined to a peak of activity lasting 6 to 8 weeks. Interestingly, an experimental challenge of cattle with a lower dose of M. bovis which {{did not result in}} the development of lesions, positive DTH skin test, or substantial IFN-γ responses nevertheless generated strong specific IL- 4 responses. Investigation of naturally infected M. bovis field reactors showed increased IFN-γ and IL- 4 responses compared to uninfected cattle and that both of these cytokines were equally able to differentiate infected from uninfected animals. The magnitude of the M. bovis-induced IL- 4 responses were found to be similar to the antigen-specific IL- 4 responses of cattle infected with the parasitic nematode Onchocerca ochengi, further supporting the presence of this type 2 cytokine in bovine tuberculosis...|$|E
40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (TB) {{is still}} a zoonotic problem in the world. Despite the fact that eradication programs for bovine TB are being implemented in many countries, it remains a public health problem. These programs are mainly based on a single intradermal tuberculin test using <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculin</b> purified protein derivative (PPD), isolation, and slaughtering of infected animals. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the specificity of the gamma interferon (IFN-γ) test in TB-free cattle herds, by using not only Australian tuberculins but also tuberculins produced at our institute, and to correlate the response with the type of production (beef cattle, dairy cattle, and a dual-purpose breed), the housing system, and the age of the animals. We studied 800 animals selected from 20 TB- and paratuberculosis-free herds. The animals were tested in parallel, after stimulation with Australian tuberculins and tuberculins produced at our institute, by using the skin test and two IFN-γ assays. The results of this trial showed that the specificity of the IFN-γ test is higher than that of the skin test (96. 8 %) and ranges from 97. 3 % (using only Australian tuberculins) to 98. 6 % (using tuberculins produced at our institute). We found that different categories of cattle could influence the specificity of the skin test but that these differences tended to be reduced in the IFN-γ assay, especially when Italian PPDs were used...|$|E
40|$|In Italy, {{according}} to the European directives, the diagnosis of tuberculosis in cattle is based on intradermal inoculation of <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculin</b> (5, 000 IU of PPD in 0, 1 ml) and/or inspection during slaughtering. The reintroduction of infections observed in some free-areas suggested to investigate wild animals in order to verify their role in bovine tuberculosis epidemiology. A two years study {{has been carried out}} in wild boars reared in free range conditions in four different regions of Central Italy. Retro-phariyngeal and sub-mandibular lymph nodes from 336 animals without macroscopic lesion were examined for mycobacteria and 16 samples (4, 8 %) resulted positive at cultures. All the isolated mycobacteria were submitted to biochemical test and randomly for PCR. On the basis of the metabolic tests, the isolates were not identified as Mycobacterium bovis, and {{according to}} the PCR results,all of theme were belonging to genus Mycobacterium. According to these results, the wild boars seem to be susceptible to mycobacteria different from M. bovis. Since infected wild boars could live in the same habitat with cows, they could be considered rather as markers of mycobacteria infection in the environment than M. bovis reservoirs. These findings suggest the need to keep in mind the presence of such boars where tuberculosis he's been previously eradicated and were doubtful cases of skin test are detected...|$|E
40|$|A realização deste trabalho, considerando a importância e a natureza pioneira das informações para o Nordeste e a inexistência de registros oficiais de órgãos públicos e privados que se tem acesso em nosso país, teve como objetivo relatar a intercorrência entre tuberculose bovina e caprina em rebanhos leiteiros de Pernambuco e avaliar os fatores de risco relacionados. A identificação de portadores de infecção pelo M. bovis foi realizada pelo Teste Cervical Comparativo (TCC) : nos bovinos, de acordo com as diretrizes do PNCEBT; nos caprinos, pelo teste da tuberculina padronizado experimentalmente para caprinos. Foram submetidas ao TCC: 88 vacas com fenótipo predominante da raça Girolanda, com idades entre três a sete anos, criados em dois rebanhos leiteiros e 168 cabras das raças Saanen, Toggenburg e Parda Alpina e seus mestiços, com idades entre dois a seis anos, criadas em seis rebanhos leiteiros localizados em municípios da Mesorregião Metropolitana de Recife, Pernambuco. Conjuntamente, a freqüência de vacas e cabras que reagiram positivamente ao teste da tuberculina foi de 10, 9 %, destacando-se taxas elevadas nos caprinos (16, 2 %) e nos bovinos (19, 4 %). As vacas e cabras que manifestaram reações imunoalérgicas clinicamente inconclusivas às tuberculinas corresponderam a 8 % e 1, 2 %, respectivamente. Conjuntamente, as freqüências de vacas e cabras positivas e inconclusivas formaram o índice de 14, 4 %. Das vacas submetidas ao TCC, 17, 0 % (15 / 88) reagiram positivamente. Em valores médios, as positivas apresentaram reações imunoalérgicas às tuberculinas bovina e aviária com intensidades de 9, 4 mm (3, 1) e 3, 3 mm (1, 1), respectivamente, sendo a diferença entre as duas de 6, 0 mm (1, 8). Das cabras submetidas ao TCC, 7, 7 % (13 / 168) reagiram positivamente. Em valores médios, as positivas apresentaram reações imunoalérgicas às tuberculinas bovina e aviária com intensidades de 14, 1 (6, 2) e 6, 4 mm (4, 2), respectivamente, sendo a diferença entre as duas de 7, 7 mm (3, 4). As evidências clínico-epidemiológicas observadas neste estudo, além de demonstrarem que a tuberculose encontra-se amplamente disseminada nos rebanhos examinados, sugerem que a infecção pelo M. bovis em caprinos pode ocorrer em conexão com a infecção em bovinos, a partir da grande circulação de leite de vaca entre rebanhos caprinos cujos produtores adquiriram a prática comum da utilização do leite de vacas para cabritos como medida preventiva contra a CAE. The {{accomplishment}} of this work, considering {{the importance and}} the pioneer nature of {{the information to the}} Northeast and the inexistence of official records of public and private agencies that we can have access in our country, had the aim of reporting the rotation between tuberculosis in bovine and in goats in milk flocks in the State of Pernambuco, and to evaluate the related factors of risk. The identification of the M. bovis infected carriers was made through Cervical Comparative Test (CCT) : in bovines, according to the lines of direction of PNCEBT; in goats, through the experimentally standardized tuberculin test for goats. Were submitted to the CCT: 88 cows with the predominant phenotype of Girolanda breed, with age between three and seven, raised in two different dairy cattles and 168 goats of Saanen, Toggenburg and Parda Alpina breeds and their crossings, with age between two and six, raised in milk flocks located in towns of the Metropolitan Region of Recife, Pernambuco. Jointly, the frequency of cows and female goats that reacted positively to the tuberculin test were 10, 9 %, standing out the high rates in goats (16, 2 %) and the bovines (19, 4 %). The cows and the female goats that had clinical inconclusive hypersensitivity reaction to the tuberculin were 8 % and 1, 2 %, respectively. Jointly, the frequency of cows and female goats that were positive and inconclusive came to the index of 14, 4 %. The cows that were submitted to the CCT, 17, 0 % (15 / 88) reacted positively. On average numbers, the positives showed hypersensitivity reaction to the <b>bovine</b> and avian <b>tuberculin</b> with the intensity of 9, 4 mm (&# 61617; 3, 1) e 3, 3 mm (&# 61617; 1, 1), respectively, having {{the difference between the two}} of 0, 6 mm (&# 61617; 1, 8). The female goats that were submitted to the CCT, 7, 7 % (13 / 168) reacted positively. On average numbers, the positives showed hypersensitivity reaction to the <b>bovine</b> and avian <b>tuberculin</b> with the intensity of 14, 1 (&# 61617; 6, 2) and 6, 4 mm (&# 61617; 4, 2), respectively, having the difference between the two of 7, 7 mm (&# 61617; 3, 4). The clinical epidemic evidences observed in this work, not also demonstrates that the tuberculin is highly disseminated on the examined flocks, as well as suggests that the M. bovis infection in goats can occur in connection with the infection in bovines, from the big circulation of cow milk between goat flocks which the producers acquire the common practice of utilizing the cow milk to the baby goats as a preventive measures against CAE...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to confirm the presence of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) and determine its prevalence, based on skin test reactivity, in cattle reared under extensive farming conditions in the Govuro district, Inhambane province, Mozambique. The study was comprised of a primary screening test using the single intradermal test (SIT) in randomly selected animals from Colonato and Sede dip tanks in Govuro. Positive reactors to the SIT were tested again with <b>bovine</b> and avian <b>tuberculin</b> using the single intradermal comparative test (SICTT) 7 weeks after the SIT. The sample size was calculated using Win Episcope 2. 0 based on 95 % confidence to detect a 2 % expected prevalence using the SIT, with a 1 % accepted error and accounting for a total population size of 7208. The calculated sample size was 682 animals. To compensate for the probability of 20 % default in reading, the sample size was increased to 853. During the testing process (SIT), it was evident from the first 3 reading days that the apparent prevalence (61, 94 %) was higher than expected (2 %), hence we decided to stop when the total number of cattle was 530. During the testing process (SIT), it was evident from the first 3 reading days that the apparent prevalence (61. 94 %) was far higher than expected (2 %), hence we decided to stop when the total number of cattle was 530. This was due to the fact that, at such a high prevalence, it would not be necessary to achieve as high a precision as 1 % accepted error. A sample size of 530 would be sufficient to achieve a precision of 4 % accepted error, which was regarded as more than adequate. The 530 cattle, 3 or more years of age, were selected using systematic random sampling from the two dip tanks (Colonato 371 and Sede 159 animals). All animals were identified by numbers painted, dorsally on the sacral region. Out of 530 tested cattle by SIT, 268 were read, and 166 / 268 (61. 94 % with 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 55. 8 – 67. 8 %) were found positive, with visible swallow at the injection site. Apparent prevalence (AP) was found to be 61. 94 % while the true prevalence (TP) was 75. 92 %. The predictive value of a positive result (PV+) was found to be 87. 9 %. No significant difference in apparent prevalence between the two areas was detected by Fisher’s exact test (P = 0. 11). By SICTT, out of 28 animals positive reactors to SIT, 21 were possible to read, and 13 / 21 (61. 9 %; 95 % CI: 55. 1 – 89. 3 %) were found positive. A three year old bull, positive reactor to the SIT, was slaughtered, and a detailed post mortem was carried out and organs with visible lesions were collected for further laboratory testing (histopathology, culture and isolation of M. Bovis and PCR). Later on, 30 more positive reactors to the SIT test were slaughtered: 25 / 30 (83. 3 %) showed visible lesions compatible with BTB, and total condemnation of carcass was made in 3 / 25 (12 %) due to generalized lesions. The high prevalence rate of skin test positive animals as well as gross lesions and histopathology were confirmed to be BTB by the isolation and identification of M. Bovis by culture and PCR. Our results suggest that bovine tuberculosis is highly prevalent in Govuro district and may thus represent a potential health problem of zoonotic tuberculosis in humans. Our results suggest that BTB has reached the plateau phase of endemicity in cattle in Govuro district. In this context, the positive predictive value of the SIT is very high and thus the use of the SICTT as a confirmatory test has a limited value and should not be advocated. Our results further indicate that no other prevalence study of BTB should be conducted {{in the next few years}} in Govuro district, unless comprehensive control measures are implemented. The focus of further studies should be on the isolation and the molecular characterization of M. Bovis from cattle and humans in order to assess transmission routes and the role played by BTB in human TB cases in Govuro district.

40|$|A {{sensitive}} two-step simultaneous {{enzyme immunoassay}} (EIA) for human gamma interferon (IFN-γ) {{has been developed}} and used as an in vitro test for human tuberculosis (TB) in comparison with tuberculin skin testing. The EIA was shown to be highly sensitive, detecting less than 0. 5 IU of recombinant human IFN-γ per ml within a linear detection range of 0. 5 to 150 IU/ml. The assay was highly reproducible and specific for native IFN-γ. In addition, the assay detected chimpanzee, orangutan, gibbon, and squirrel monkey IFN-γs. Cross-reactions with other human cytokines or with IFN-γs derived from mice, cattle, or Old World monkeys were not evident. The assay was used to detect TB infection by incubating whole blood overnight with human, avian, and <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculin</b> purified protein derivatives (PPDs), as well as positive (mitogen) - and negative-control preparations. The levels of IFN-γ in plasma supernatants were then determined. Blood from 10 tuberculin skin test-positive individuals responded predominantly to the human tuberculin PPD antigen {{and to a lesser}} extent to bovine and avian PPD antigens. By contrast, blood from 10 skin test-negative individuals showed minimal responses or no response to any of the tuberculin PPDs. Detectable levels of IFN-γ were present in all blood samples stimulated with mitogen. In vivo tuberculin reactivity was correlated with IFN-γ responsiveness in vitro. These results support the further study of the blood culture–IFN-γ EIA system as an alternative to skin testing for the detection of human TB infection...|$|E
40|$|To date, {{the most}} {{promising}} vaccination strategies for the control of bovine tuberculosis (TB) focus on improving the efficacy of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). However, vaccination with BCG results in sensitization of animals to <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculin</b> and compromises tests currently used for diagnosis of bovine TB infection. Thus, the development of specific diagnostic reagents capable of discriminating between infected and uninfected vaccinated animals (DIVA) is of high priority. To test the hypothesis that M. bovis-secreted proteins are likely to contain immunogenic antigens {{that can be used}} to increase the specificity of diagnostic tests, we screened 379 pools of overlapping peptides representing 119 antigens for their ability to stimulate a gamma inferferon (IFN-γ) response in vitro using whole blood from both TB reactor and BCG-vaccinated animals. Peptide pools representing antigens Rv 3020 c and Rv 2346 c induced responses in 61 % and 57 % of the TB reactor animals, respectively, without inducing responses in any BCG-vaccinated animal studied. Furthermore, individual peptides contained within pools recognized by BCG vaccinates were identified that were specific and induced IFN-γ responses in TB reactor animals. From these results, we constructed a cocktail of nine peptides representing multiple antigen targets that was recognized by 54 % of TB reactor animals but also failed to induce responses in any BCG-vaccinated animal studied. In summary, we have identified three peptide cocktails for prioritization in larger trials to discriminate between M. bovis infection and BCG vaccination...|$|E
40|$|MPB 70 is {{a highly}} species {{specific}} protein which is secreted from Mycobacterium bovis during culture. To investigate whether antibodies against MPB 70 {{can be used as}} an indicator of infection with M. bovis, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed, based on the use of biotinylated protein G, to provide a common indicator for antibody formation in different species. During experimental infection with M. bovis in cattle, a characteristic pattern of anti-MPB 70 antibody production was observed with an initial flat plateau followed by a marked rise 18 to 20 weeks after infection. Skin testing with <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculin</b> purified protein derivative (PPD), which was shown to contain antibody-reactive MPB 70, was a potent stimulator of antibody production in infected animals. In experimentally infected cattle, we observed an inverse relationship between antibody activity and delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test reactions. In natural M. bovis infections, skin testing with PPD was also a potent stimulator of anti-MPB 70 formation. Comparison between the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to MPB 70 and that for antibodies to the widely cross-reacting M. bovis BCG antigen 85 B in animals with M. bovis, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium paratuberculosis, and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis infections showed that formation of antibody to MPB 70 was highly specific for infection with M. bovis. The use of an MPB 70 -containing PPD preparation for skin testing followed by this anti-MPB 70 assay {{is a highly}} specific indicator of M. bovis infection. Adjustment of the test conditions is expected to provide an increased sensitivity of the procedure for the diagnosis of natural M. bovis infections...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIreland {{currently}} obtains its avian and <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculin</b> purified protein derivatives (PPDs) from {{a single}} source. Because problems of supply or quality cannot be discounted, it is prudent that Ireland identify alternative supplier(s) {{as part of a}} broad risk management strategy. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} compare the performance of a number of different tuberculin combinations (that is, pairings of bovine and avian PPD; with different manufacturers) in the single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT), as currently performed in Ireland. The study was randomised, controlled and double-blinded. A total of 2, 172 cattle were used in the study. Each animal was tested using two SICTTs, the first based on the tuberculin combination in current use, and the second using one of six trial tuberculin combinations. Analyses were conducted to compare both reactor-status and skin increase. For each control/trial tuberculin combination, there was good agreement between the control and trial reactor-status. Differences in skin increases were mainly confined to animals categorised as either negative or severe inconclusive. However, the measured differences were minor, and unlikely to have a significant impact on the actual test outcome, either for individual animals or for herds. In conclusion, while further studies determining sensitivity and specificity in Ireland would have to be done in the event of a change in tuberculin PPD there should be minimal disruption of the national programme if alternative tuberculin PPDs meeting WHO, OIE and EU regulations were used. In this study, the precision of the guinea pig bio-assay to assess tuberculin potency was low and therefore Ireland should maintain its practice of periodically assessing potency in naturally infected cattle, even though this is not currently required under WHO, OIE or EU Regulations...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{detection}} and removal of infected cattle, using immunodiagnostic tests {{such as the}} comparative intradermal tuberculin (CIDT) test, are the basis of control strategies for bovine tuberculosis (TB). According to the Office des Internationale Epizooties recommendation, the cutoff point for positivity of the CIDT test, calculated as the difference between skin thicknesses after <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculin</b> (B) and avian tuberculin (A) injections (B − A), is > 4 mm. This cutoff point is used worldwide, although {{it is likely that}} local conditions influence test performance. Thus, this study was formulated to determine CIDT test cutoff points applicable to cattle in central Ethiopia. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed for the CIDT test, using data from 186 Bos indicus (zebu) and Bos taurus (Holstein) cattle. Detailed postmortem examination for the presence of TB lesions was used to define disease status. At a cutoff of > 2 mm, CIDT test sensitivity was 69 % (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 58. 5 to 79 %), while it was 59 % (95 % CI, 49 to 69 %) at a cutoff of > 4 mm. In contrast, specificities of the CIDT test at these two cutoff values were identical, at 97 % (95 % CI, 89 to 100 %). Thus, the maximum sensitivity of the CIDT test can be realized using a > 2 -mm cutoff without affecting specificity. The apparent prevalence was significantly (χ 2 = 13. 56; P 2 mm (16. 0 %; n = 5, 424) than at a > 4 -mm cutoff (13. 5 %; n = 5, 424). Nonetheless, no significant difference (χ 2 = 2. 15; P = 0. 14) in true prevalence was observed at a cutoff of > 2 mm (19. 6 %) and at a cutoff of > 4 mm (18. 5 %). Thus, our study demonstrates the importance of defining local, relevant cutoff values to maximize test sensitivity, and we suggest the application of the > 2 -mm cutoff for testing of cattle in central Ethiopia...|$|E
40|$|Anobservational case–control {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate risk factors for confirmed bovine tuberculosis (bTB) infection in cattle reacting positively to the single intradermal comparative cervical test (SICCT) in Northern Ireland in the years 1998, 2002 and 2006. Macroscopic lesions were detected at slaughter (positive visible lesion (VL) status) in 43. 0 % of reactor cattle, whilst 45. 3 % of those sampled were confirmed as bTB positive due to the presence of lesions or positive histopathology/mycobacterial culture (positive bTB status). In 97. 5 % of the reactors, the VL status and bTB status were either both negative or both positive. Generalized linear mixed model analyses were conducted on data of 24, 923 reactor cattle with the variables herd identifier, local veterinary office (DVO) and abattoir being used asrandomeffects within all the models generated at univariable and multivariable level. The other variables within the dataset were used as fixed effects. Significant risk factors associated with VL status and bTB status at multivariable level (p < 0. 05) included age at death, breed, sex, test year, net increase in skin thickness at <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculin</b> injection site, epidemiological status of skin test, total number of reactors at the disclosure test, mean herd size and prior response to the skin test. These risk factors are likely related to the time since infection, the strength of the challenge of infection and the susceptibility of the animal. These findings are important as the detection of visible lesions and the confirmation of bTB {{are an integral part of}} the overall bTB control programme in Northern Ireland and the veterinary meat inspection and hygiene programme. The visible lesion status and bTB status of an animal can affect the way in which bTB breakdowns are managed, since failure to detect visible lesions and recovery of Mycobacterium bovis can lead to a less stringent follow-up after other risk factors have been taken into account.

40|$|Aims and objectives: The Mycobacterium avium subsp avium (MAA) is a slow-growing, frequently-encountered {{mycobacterium}} in {{the environment}} that causes tuberculosis mainly in birds and sometimes in farm animals. As a favorite pet bird, the pigeon is extensively kept for homing and/or racing purposes in Iran, therefore, the main objective {{of this study was}} to investigate dissemination of M. avium subsp avium (MAA) in pigeon aviaries in Tabriz, North-western Iran. Methods: From a total of 140 birds collected from private flocks (n = 3), The pathologically changed lungs and the lymph node were examined histologically by staining with Ziehl–Neelsen (Z–N) and hematoxylin–eosin; 39 were subjected to bacterial culture, out of which 34 mycobacterial isolates were recovered. Mycobacterial DNA was isolated according to the previously described method (Van Soolingen et al., 1993). Applying a five-PCR diagnostic algorithm targeting short, but definitive stretches of 16 S rRNA and RV 0577 genes, IS 6110, IS 901 and IS 1245 genomic loci, all the isolates were identified as MAA. PvuII-IS 901 RFLP typing was also performed on all isolates. Results: They were either IS 901 +/IS 1245 + (n = 22) or IS 901 +/IS 1245 (n = 12). In IS 901 -RFLP strain typing of a subset of the isolates (n = 22), they were classified into five distinct multi-banded but similar patterns, namely PA (n = 13), PB (n = 5), PC (n = 2), PD (n = 1) and PE (n = 1). No correlation between IS 901 -RFLP genotype and presence/lack of IS 1245 was noted as isolates both holding and lacking IS 1245 were found to share PA and PB genotypes. Whilst no case of mixed infection with more than one strain was detected in any single bird, it was not possible to extend this observation to the aviary level as original colonies of birds were not recorded. When four healthy cattle sensitized against Mycobacterium bovis AN 5 and M. avium D 4 were tuberculinated, the results confirmed the observed skin reactions against <b>bovine</b> <b>tuberculin</b> in animals sensitized with M. avium were large enough to complicate test interpretation. Conclusions: It is believed that the extent of such epidemiological impact deserves further investigation if progress in the control of bovine tuberculosis is intended. This indicates the importance of identification of the causative agent before any conclusions are made, based solely upon the results of the skin test and histopathological examination...|$|E
