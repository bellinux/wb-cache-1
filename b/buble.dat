25|$|After {{the success}} of Bublé's self-titled debut, DRG Records belatedly {{released}} the soundtrack from the 2001 film, Totally Blonde {{in which he had}} a co-starring role as a nightclub singer and club owner. DRG ignored the music's connection to the film by altering the title and putting a shot of <b>Bublé</b> on the cover, making it appear as if this was a proper Michael <b>Bublé</b> release.

His first national TV performance was on a 1997 award-winning Bravo! documentary titled Big Band Boom!, directed by Mark Glover Masterson. Beginning in 1997, he became a frequent guest on Vicki Gabereau's national talk show on the CTV network. During its first season, the Vancouver-based program aired live, which ultimately worked in Bublé's favour. When a scheduled guest was forced to cancel, the show's music producer often asked <b>Bublé</b> to fill in at the last minute. The Gabereau appearances provided <b>Bublé</b> with great exposure, but they also helped the singer hone his television skills as a performer and as an interview guest. In a mutual show of gratitude, <b>Bublé</b> appeared on the final Gabereau show in 2005, along with Jann Arden and Elvis Costello.|$|E
