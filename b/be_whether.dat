25|$|One of {{the most}} {{enduring}} literary themes connected with the figure of Circe was her ability to change men into animals. There was much speculation concerning how this could <b>be,</b> <b>whether</b> the human consciousness changed at the same time, and even {{whether it was a}} change for the better. In the first century CE, Plutarch took up the theme in a lively dialogue that was later to have several imitators. Contained in his Moralia is the Gryllus episode in which Circe allows Odysseus to interview a fellow Greek turned into a pig. There his interlocutor informs Odysseus that his present existence is preferable to the human. They then engage in a philosophical dialogue in which every human value is questioned and beasts are proved to be of superior wisdom and virtue.|$|E

25|$|The {{global warming}} {{controversy}} concerns {{the public debate}} over whether global warming is occurring, how much has occurred in modern times, what has caused it, what its effects will <b>be,</b> <b>whether</b> any action {{should be taken to}} curb it, and if so what that action should be. In the scientific literature, there is a strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view, though a few organizations with members in extractive industries hold non-committal positions. Disputes over the key scientific facts of global warming are more prevalent in the media than in the scientific literature, where such issues are treated as resolved, and such disputes are more prevalent in the United States than globally.|$|E
25|$|To {{explore a}} male {{strategic}} point of view, proponents of FCC make a simple model of alternative strategies. Female A uses cosmetics {{as part of}} her ritual coalition whenever one of them menstruates; Female B and all her female neighbors use no cosmetics. Male A is prepared to work/invest to gain access; Male B tries a philanderer strategy, moving to the next cycling fertile female, neglecting the previous partner once she is pregnant. Very quickly, Male A will end up working/doing bride-service for Female A's coalition, since he has no competition from Male B. Male A gains regular fitness as a result. Male B will pair up with Female B, but is then liable to abandon her if he finds a new cycling female. She then has little support during pregnancy/breastfeeding. The question will <b>be</b> <b>whether</b> Male B gains sufficient fitness via a roving strategy of picking up cycling, non-cosmetic females. If Male A is not able to compete with Male B in terms of dominance, he is better off choosing the cosmetic females. Because Female B and her non-cosmetic female neighbors get the attentions, but no reliable investment, from Male B, they discourage any investment from the likes of Male A. Once costs of encephalization begin to bite and cooperative strategies are needed to support offspring, how many females will be choosing philanderers in preference to investors? Those females {{are not likely to be}} ancestors of large-brained hominins like ourselves or the Neanderthals.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the history}} of ancient Egypt, animals were highly respected. In no other culture have animals been as {{influential}} in so many aspects of life, nor has any culture depicted animals as often in their artwork or writing. It is estimated that 2 in every 4 or 5 Egyptian hieroglyphs relates to animals. Egyptians believed that animals were crucial to both physical and spiritual survival—vital to physical survival because they were {{a major source of}} food and to spiritual survival based on how well a person treated animals during their life on earth. Some animals were considered to be literal incarnations of the gods, and therefore, it is understandable why Egyptians would have wanted to hold such animals in the highest regard, giving them a proper burial through mummification. The Egyptian religion taught of life after death. In order to determine a person’s admittance or denial to the afterlife, the gods would ask a series of judgment questions. One of these crucial questions would <b>be</b> <b>whether</b> they had mistreated any animals during their life on earth. Because of this religious belief, the killing of an animal was considered a serious crime punishable by death. Diodorus Siculus, a Greek historian from the 1st century B.C., witnessed the lynching of a Roman who had accidentally killed a cat during a visit to Egypt. Understandably, this punishment frightened many Egyptians to the point that if one would happen upon a dead animal, they would flee from it as to avoid the accusation of being its killer.|$|E

25|$|Improved {{discipline}} worked smoothly till 1718, when it {{came into}} collision with Earl's civil authorities, owing {{in part to the}} reduction of revenue through Wilson's practice of mitigating fines in the spiritual court. Robert Mawdesley, governor from 1703, had been in harmony with Wilson; his successor in 1713, Alexander Horne, became Wilson's determined opponent. The substantive points at issue appear to <b>be</b> <b>whether</b> appeals in ecclesiastical cases should be made to ecclesiastical authorities or to the civil authority of the Lord of Mann; and, later, whether or not soldiers of the Lord of Mann should fall under ecclesiastical rule. The first direct conflict began in 1716. Mary Henricks, a married woman, was excommunicated for adultery, and condemned to penance and prison. She appealed to the lord of the isle, and Horne allowed the appeal. Wilson, rightly maintaining that there was no appeal except to the Archbishop of York, did not appear at the hearing, and was fined £10; the fine was remitted. The episcopal registrar, John Woods of Kirk Malew, was twice imprisoned (1720 and 1721) for refusing to act without the bishop's direction. In 1721, the governor's wife, Jane Horne, was ordered to ask forgiveness (in mitigation of penance) for slanderous statements. For admitting her to communion and for false doctrine Archdeacon Robert Horrobin, the governor's chaplain, was suspended in 1722. Refusing to recall the sentence, Wilson was fined £60, and his vicars-general £20 apiece, and in default were imprisoned in Castle Rushen. Wilson appealed to the crown; they were released, but the fines were paid through Thomas Corlett. The dampness of the prison had so affected Wilson's right hand that he was henceforth unable to move his fingers to write. In 1724 the bishopric of Exeter was offered to Wilson as a means of reimbursement. He refused, reputedly saying to Queen Caroline, “I will not forsake my wife and children because they are poor". On his declining, George I promised to meet his expenses from the privy purse, a pledge which the king's death left unfulfilled.|$|E

500|$|In a September 2008 {{interview}} with BBC Radio 4, Ray Davies said {{of a possible}} reunion, [...] "There is a desire to do it", but that he wouldn't participate {{if it were a}} nostalgia act: [...] "The thing that would make me decide 'yes' or 'no' would <b>be</b> <b>whether</b> or not we could do new songs". He added that the main barrier to the band getting back together was his brother's condition following his stroke. Two months later, he told the BBC that the band was beginning to write new material for a possible reunion, but failed to detail which members were involved. In an interview aired that December on the Biography Channel, Quaife rejected any possibility that he would take part in a reunion. That same month, Ray Davies spoke again about the possibility of performing with his brother: [...] "I suggested he do some low-key shows to see how well he can play. If we're going to play together again, we can't hit the road straight away with a big-time announcement.... But, if Dave feels good about it and there's good new material that we can write, it'll happen." ...|$|E

Kennedy {{had been}} a patron of Le Pavillon, but after Decré and Meyzen opened their new restaurant, Kennedy {{switched}} his patronage to La Caravelle, dining there regularly when in New York. [...] It became a popular place for the Kennedy family to visit. Fessaguet chose and trained René Verdon to be chef at the White House when John F.

500|$|Grant's {{appeal was}} unusually broad, among {{both men and}} women; Kael remarked that men wanted to be him and women dreamed of dating him. She noticed that Grant treated his female co-stars {{differently}} {{to most of the}} leading players at the time, regarding them as subjects with multiple qualities rather than [...] "treating them as sex objects". For writer David Shipman, he seemed to meet the requirement for every figure to aspire to <b>be,</b> <b>whether</b> it was an uncle, best friend or lover, and [...] "more than most stars he belonged to the public". A number of critics have argued that Grant had the rare star ability to turn a mediocre picture into a good one. Philip T. Hartung of The Commonweal in his review for Mr. Lucky (1943) stated that if it [...] "weren't for Cary Grant's persuasive personality the whole thing would melt away to nothing at all". For McCann Hollywood had [...] "found its ideal gentleman, a gentleman for a democratic culture. He was an amalgam of tradition and modernity, wealth and virtue, elite and mass, high and low, great and good". He states that Grant's delivery should [...] "not have worked, but somehow it did", commenting: [...] "As he sits and faces the camera during that early scene in The Awful Truth, he looks at us with an expression that suggests he knows as well as we do that the audacious trick has, against all the odds, actually come off. He smiles at us, sharing with us his extraordinary good fortune. He smiles a smile like Gatsby's smile." [...] Political theorist C. L. R. James saw Grant as a [...] "new and very important symbol", a new type of Englishman who differed from the Leslie Howard and Ronald Coleman gentleman types, who represented the [...] "freedom, natural grace, simplicity and directness which characterise such different American types as Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan", which ultimately symbolized the growing relationship between Britain and America.|$|E
