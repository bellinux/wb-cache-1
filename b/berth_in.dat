5|$|ACC teams viewed a <b>berth</b> <b>in</b> the Humanitarian Bowl as {{undesirable}} {{due to its}} location. Aside {{from being}} one of the lower priority tie-ins, the destination is far outside the conference's geographic footprint. Travel costs from the East Coast are prohibitively expensive and historically caused low turnout among ACC fans. In addition, the game is hosted at a cold-weather venue, which is a disadvantage in comparison with ACC bowl games in places such as Florida, California, and Georgia.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} George Washington 27–6, the Terrapins {{went on to}} {{shut out}} two ranked teams: 11th-ranked Mississippi and 11th-ranked Alabama.

5|$|In Nevada's final {{regular season}} game, Kaepernick led the Wolf Pack in a second-half {{comeback}} to defeat Louisiana Tech. The seventh win guaranteed Nevada a <b>berth</b> <b>in</b> {{one of the}} three WAC tie-in bowls. The Wolf Pack finished the season in a three-way tie for second place in the WAC alongside Hawaii and Louisiana Tech. Hawaii had a standing contract with the home-town Hawaii Bowl where it played Notre Dame. Louisiana Tech, having lost to both Nevada and Hawaii, appeared unlikely to be selected for a bowl at all. However, the Bulldogs were {{able to take advantage of}} a provisional WAC <b>berth</b> <b>in</b> the Independence Bowl since neither the Big 12 nor the Southeastern Conference could provide eligible teams. Two other WAC teams achieved bowl eligibility with 6–6 records. Fresno State secured a slot in the New Mexico Bowl, but San Jose State was unable to find an at-large berth.|$|E
5|$|Irene Prescott was {{the sole}} swimmer in the {{delegation}} of Tonga. She competed in two events, the 50– and 100m backstrokes.

She was also eliminated in the preliminary heat of 100m backstroke after ranking 13th {{with a time of}} 1:13.42.|$|E
5|$|Johnson did not {{initially}} aspire to play professionally, focusing instead on his communication studies major {{and on his}} desire to become a television commentator. Playing with future NBA draftees Greg Kelser, Jay Vincent and Mike Brkovich, Johnson averaged 17.0points, 7.9rebounds, and 7.4assists per game as a freshman, and led the Spartans to a 25–5record, the Big Ten Conference title, and a <b>berth</b> <b>in</b> the 1978 NCAA Tournament. The Spartans reached the Elite Eight, but lost narrowly to eventual national champion Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after {{returning}} to the Argonauts, Alford was promoted to the active roster. He played in nine regular season games, missing some time with a hamstring injury. In the final regular season game, Alford caught 10 passes for 111 {{yards and a touchdown}} as the Argonauts defeated the Stampeders 33–32 and earned a playoff <b>berth.</b> <b>In</b> the East Final, the Argonauts lost 35–18 against the Alouettes, with Alford scoring a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|The 1981 Major League Baseball strike {{caused the}} season to be split into two halves. The Yankees were given a <b>berth</b> <b>in</b> an {{expanded}} playoff tournament because they led the American League East when the strike began.

5|$|The Colts' 24–6 {{victory over}} the Buccaneers {{clinched}} their first playoff <b>berth</b> <b>in</b> 10 years, and their first winning record since 1977.

Colts quarterback Jack Trudeau was 17 of 27 for 426yards.|$|E
