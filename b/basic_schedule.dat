40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{distributed}} throughput-optimal ad hoc wireless network scheduling algorithm, which {{is motivated by}} the celebrated simplex algorithm for solving linear programming (LP) problems. The scheduler stores a sparse set of basic schedules, and chooses the max-weight <b>basic</b> <b>schedule</b> for transmission in each time slot. At the same time, the scheduler tries to update the set of basic schedules by searching for a new <b>basic</b> <b>schedule</b> in a throughput increasing direction. We show that both of the above procedures can be achieved in a distributed manner. Specifically, we propose an average consensus based link contending algorithm to implement the distributed max weight scheduling. Further, we show that the <b>basic</b> <b>schedule</b> update can be implemented using CSMA mechanisms, {{which is similar to}} the one proposed by Jiang et al. Compared to the optimal distributed scheduler in Jiang's paper, where schedules change in a random walk fashion, our algorithm has a better delay performance by achieving faster schedule transitions in the steady state. The performance of the algorithm is finally confirmed by simulation results. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures. A shorter version will appear in the proceedings of IEEE ICC 201...|$|E

40|$|It is well known, {{that the}} present {{techniques}} for production scheduling in flexible manufactoring systems (FMS) are not satisfactory (compare e. g. (1)). Some production planning systems (PPS) {{may be able to}} produce detailled schedules for the production of a fixed workload in a certain period, but in a dynamically changing environment (changes of due dates, introduction of new orders, breakdown of machines or lack of personell) such a schedule soon becomes obsolete. The enormous complexity of the task on the PPS level on the other hand prohibits a repetitive replanning on this level. Thus extending the task of detailled production scheduling within the PPS is not feasible. The only possible way to improve the situation is to decentralize the scheduling function and to assign it to the control units of small segments of the system, e. g. flexible work cells or certain sets of machines (workshops). This paper is concerned with the scheduling problem in subsystems of a large production pro cess. Even for such subsystems, the task to schedule a number of operations on the machines (which we assume to possess overlapping functionality with possibly different effectivity) is by far too complex to calculate the exact optimum in the time available in a dynamically changing environment with disturbances of all kinds present. The algorithms which we have developped have a two-layer structure where first a <b>basic</b> <b>schedule</b> is calculated using modified priority rules. This <b>basic</b> <b>schedule</b> is then improved by intelligent search strategies with the goal of just-in-time production with minimal residence time.

In fact, data loss imposes severe impact on broadcast performance, as briefly shown in [9]. In this paper, we study how to systematically derive optimal broadcast schedules for random-loss channels. The key idea is to employ proper MDS codes in the schedules. We show that the proposed scheme can achieve optimal performance, in terms of expected delivery time, and is much more robust to variations of channel loss probabilities, compared to those not using codes. In addition, we study the effect of <b>basic</b> <b>schedule</b> unit and conclude that the impact is prominent when data loss presents. I...|$|E

40|$|Response {{rate and}} the {{proportion}} of time pigeons allocated to a key-pecking activity were measured on several basic types of reinforcement schedules. Reinforcement frequency was varied within each type of <b>basic</b> <b>schedule,</b> and the effects on two constituents of response rate were noted. Propensity, the proportion of time the birds spent on a platform in front of the key, showed very consistent effects as reinforcement frequency varied: in general, it decreased when reinforcement frequency markedly decreased and it increased when reinforcement frequency increased. Speed, key pecks per unit of time spent on the platform, showed inconsistent effects when reinforcement frequency varied. Consequently, response rate showed less consistent effects than did propensity. Cumulative response records demonstrated the existence of several different types of transitions or boundary states between the key-pecking activity and other activities. The types of transitions that occurred between activities depended on both the type of reinforcement schedule and the frequency of reinforcement. The propensity data support the position that general laws of behavior can be based on temporal measures of behavior. The speed data suggest that, if a complete assessment of the dynamic properties of behavior is to be achieved, measures of behavior must incorporate the structural variations in the operant unit...|$|E
