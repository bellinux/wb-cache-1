5|$|Although press freedoms have {{improved}} {{since the first}} decade of the 21st century, the press is corrupt and <b>beholden</b> <b>to</b> special interests and political groups. Newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals. The major radio and television stations are state-run and other communications, such as land-based telephones and telegraphs, are largely under government control. However, cell phone networks and Internet providers have increased dramatically since {{the first decade of}} the 21st century and are largely unregulated.|$|E
5|$|Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin– A well-off {{lawyer who}} is engaged to Raskolnikov's sister Dunya in the {{beginning}} of the novel. His motives for the marriage are rather despicable, as he states more or less that he chose her since she will be completely <b>beholden</b> <b>to</b> him financially. Luzhin represents immorality throughout the book, in contrast to Svidrigaïlov's amorality, and Raskolnikov's misguided morality.|$|E

5|$|The delegates {{also agreed}} with Madison that the {{executive}} function {{had to be}} independent of the legislature. In their aversion to kingly power, American legislatures had created state governments where the executive was <b>beholden</b> <b>to</b> the legislature, and by the late 1780s this was widely seen as being a source of paralysis. The Confederation government was the ultimate example of this.|$|E
5|$|As Wilson {{adjusted}} his lineup of potential Cabinet appointees, he and House considered Lane for {{the positions of}} Attorney General and Secretary of War. Finally, Wilson wrote to him on February 24, 1913, offering him the Interior position, and, although the two had never met, he accepted the post. According to The New York Times, Chairman Lane was selected since {{he was one of}} the few California Democrats who had fought the railroads and who was not <b>beholden</b> <b>to</b> Hearst. At the time, it was customary not to make an official announcement of Cabinet appointments until the new President formally submitted the names to the Senate on the afternoon of Inauguration Day, March 4; however, The New York Times obtained the list of Wilson's appointees a day early. The Senate met in special session on March 5, and approved all of President Wilson's Cabinet appointees.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} also shortened the president's term {{from seven}} years to four years, freed the president to seek re-election after an initial term, and moved impeachment trials from the courts to the Senate. They also created {{the office of the}} vice president, whose only roles were to succeed a president unable to complete a term of office, to preside over the Senate, and to cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate. The committee transferred important powers from the Senate to the president, for example the power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors. One controversial issue throughout much of the Convention had been the length of the president's term, and whether the president was to be term limited. The problem had resulted from the understanding that the president would be chosen by Congress; the decision to have the president be chosen instead by an electoral college reduced the chance of the president becoming <b>beholden</b> <b>to</b> Congress, so a shorter term with eligibility for re-election became a viable option.|$|E

5000|$|To {{protect their}} rights and avoid vassalage to more {{powerful}} nobles, they organized themselves into three unions (Partheien) in the late 15th century and into a single body in 1577, and fought to win recognition. This status, <b>beholden</b> only <b>to</b> the Emperor himself rather than through a more powerful noble, meant the Imperial Knights were [...] "immediate subjects" [...] (their fealty was unmediated by another lord). As such, the Imperial Knights exercised a limited form of sovereignty within their territories.|$|R
5|$|The {{subject of}} a {{permanent}} capital for the United States was discussed numerous times during the years immediately following the Revolutionary War, however, the Continental Congress could never agree on a site due to regional loyalties and tensions. In September 1788, the Congress of the Confederation selected New York City as the nation's temporary capital under the incoming federal government. The framers of the Constitution granted the new U.S. Congress exclusive governing jurisdiction over a federal district, intentionally separate from not <b>beholden</b> <b>to</b> any state. The Constitution, however, said nothing about where it would be. Discussions during the 1st Congress about where to locate the permanent seat of government revolved around two locations: one site on the Potomac River near Georgetown; and another site on the Susquehanna River near Wrights Ferry (now Columbia, Pennsylvania). The Susquehanna River site {{was approved by the}} House in September 1789, while legislation under consideration in the Senate specified a site on the Delaware River near Germantown, Pennsylvania. No agreement was reached, and the subject was deferred until the second session.|$|E
5|$|When taxes once {{payable to}} Rome were {{transferred}} to the Crown, Cromwell saw the need to assess the taxable value of the Church's extensive holdings as they stood in 1535. The result was an extensive compendium, the Valor Ecclesiasticus. In September of the same year, Cromwell commissioned a more general visitation of religious institutions, to be undertaken by four appointee visitors. The visitation focussed almost exclusively on the country's religious houses, with largely negative conclusions. In addition to reporting back to Cromwell, the visitors made {{the lives of the}} monks more difficult by enforcing strict behavioural standards. The result was to encourage self-dissolution. In any case, the evidence gathered by Cromwell led swiftly {{to the beginning of the}} state-enforced dissolution of the monasteries with all religious houses worth less than £200 vested by statute in the crown in January 1536. After a short pause, surviving religious houses were transferred one by one to the Crown and onto new owners, and the dissolution confirmed by a further statute in 1539. By January 1540 no such houses remained: some 800 had been dissolved. The process had been efficient, with minimal resistance, and brought the crown some £90,000 a year. The extent to which the dissolution of all houses was planned from the start is debated by historians; there is some evidence that major houses were originally intended only to be reformed. Cromwell's actions transferred a fifth of England's landed wealth to new hands. The programme was designed primarily to create a landed gentry <b>beholden</b> <b>to</b> the crown, which would use the lands much more efficiently. Although little opposition to the supremacy could be found in England's religious houses, they had links to the international church and were an obstacle to further religious reform.|$|E

Parallel to that are his compositions which according to his own opinion are captured improvisations that {{in the line of}} the ritual want to be intelligible to each church member. They want to avoid modern paths without becoming a slave to the epigonic copy of the style of a specific standard. They are distinguished by an ever tonal melodic that is even with recitative texts songlike and <b>beholden</b> especially <b>to</b> the Silesian and also the Nordic folklore." ...|$|R

Williams questioned why {{there has never been}} any massive public push to force SEPTA to [...] "clean up its act." [...] He concluded that the crisis within SEPTA [...] "merely reflects the broader problems of local provincialism and petty political squabbles which are so rampant within the region."

40|$|The {{development}} of a secular legal profession in the 16 th century compromised the sacerdotal role envisaged for common lawyers by Sir John Fortescue in De Laudibus Legum Angliae. During the Elizabethan era, lawyers were no longer perceived as oracles of divine wisdom, but rather as legal technocrats, <b>beholden</b> not <b>to</b> God but {{to a set of}} saleable rhetorical skills. This article suggests that the Elizabethan legal community, based at the Inns of Court in London, sought to redress the ethical deficit by creating an order of signs which synthesized the Renaissance tenets of Neoplatonic humanism with the imperatives of Judaeo-Christian theology. With particular emphasis on the description by Gerard Legh of his visit to the Inner Temple revels of Christmas 1561, in The Accedens of Armory, I consider the symbolism of images employed by the Inns of Court, and their status as iconic sign of immemorial authority...|$|R

Geoffrey Keating, in his 17th-century History of Ireland, says that during the winter the fianna were quartered and fed by the nobility, during which time they would keep order on their behalf.

Nevertheless, his style proved popular with the public, and commissions came in to do Western-style landscapes, decorative screens, and nudes. He did life drawings and used them for material in his paintings. Ōkyo was probably the first Japanese artist to do life drawings from nude models. The subject was still considered pornographic in Japan. During his career he painted for wealthy merchants, the shogunate, even the emperor.|$|E

In Ifriqiyah, {{at the time of}} the Fatimids, there was disdain for any rule from the east regardless if it was Sunni or Shi'a. Hence the rise in medieval Tunisia (Ifriqiya) of regimes not <b>beholden</b> <b>to</b> the east (al-Mashriq), which marks a new and a popular era of Berber sovereignty.|$|E
