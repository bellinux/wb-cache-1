50|$|Most {{prevalent}} work {{principle for}} CSH is Bell Crank Mechanism. The <b>Bell</b> <b>crank</b> <b>lever</b> rotates around the Fulcrum point. One {{end of the}} <b>Bell</b> <b>crank</b> <b>lever</b> {{is connected to the}} pipe ‘P’, the other end is connected to the spring by the tie rod. Thus when the pipe moves down from cold to hot condition, the point P moves down, and as it moves down the <b>Bell</b> <b>crank</b> <b>lever</b> will rotate in the anti clock wise direction & tie rod connected to the spring will be pulled in, by which the spring gets further compressed. When the pipe moves up the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> <b>lever</b> will rotate (in the clock wise direction) & the tie rod connected to spring will be pushed out thus allowing the spring to expand or relax.|$|E
50|$|The {{instrument}} is initially calibrated to the standard, and the zero {{is set to}} this value. Then, the test specimen are placed on the measuring table and are slid below the plunger of the instrument. Any difference in the measured dimension of the specimen will result in either the lowering or rising of the plunger. The lowering or rising of plunger will make the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> <b>lever</b> to move in forward or backward direction, and in turn, will twist or untwist the metallic strip.the centre line of strip is perforated {{in order to prevent}} excessive stress.|$|E
50|$|A {{metallic}} strip is {{twisted and}} fixed between two ends as shown. Any longitudinal movement (in either direction) {{will cause the}} central portion of the strip to rotate. One end of the strip is fixed to an adjustable cantilever and the other end is fixed to the spring elbow. The spring elbow, in turn, is connected to a plunger, which moves upwards or downwards. The spring elbow, which consists of flexible strips and a stiff diagonal acts as a <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> <b>lever</b> and causes the twisted strip to change length whenever there is a movement in the plunger. This change in length {{will result in a}} proportional amount of twist of the metallic strip. The magnification can be varied by changing the length of the spring elbow.|$|E
5000|$|The {{unsuccessful}} military prototype {{was originally}} powered by an air-cooled transverse V-twin, {{but a new}} engine was developed at their Oakley works in Chiswick for the luxury production Wilkinson in December 1911. This was a water-cooled 848 cc with a large radiator at the front. An in-line four-cylinder side-valve, it had a bore and stroke of 60 x 75 mm. Redesignated the 'TMC' (forTouring Motor Cycle'), the Wilkinson TMC {{was one of the}} top of the range motorcycles built before the First World War. It had no front brake, so relied on twin drum rear brakes which were pedal operated. The brazed lug tubular frame was fully sprung with quarter elliptic rear springs and 'girder' front forks with horizontal springs compressed through <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> <b>levers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Semi or {{completely}} autonomous unmanned vehicles, remotely driven or controlled through artificial intelligence, are instrumental to foster space exploration. One {{of the most}} essential tasks of a rover is terrain traversing which requires the need of efficient suspension systems. This communication presents a suspension system giving degrees of freedom to every wheel {{with the help of}} linear actuators connected through <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> <b>levers.</b> The actuation of linear actuators directly varies the height of every wheel from the chassis hence offering articulation to the rover. A control system is developed offering an algorithm for its autonomous actuation. This system proves instrumental for leveling of the chassis where any kind of slope, roll or pitch, may impute abstaining of payloads from efficient working. This was tried and tested successfully {{as a part of the}} rover developed by Team RUDRA from SRM University, INDIA (first Team from Asia and finishing at the fifth position) at University Rover Challenge 2013, held at UTAH, USA in May-June.

50|$|In 1931, {{following}} {{the sale of}} Simmonds Aircraft, Simmonds went to Paris to attend the annual Air Show at Le Bourget, which included a large fixed display of aircraft equipment suppliers. One of these was the Coursey Company which made push pull controls for use in operating aircraft control surfaces. The design of these were ingenious for their day in that you could push significant loads, as well as pull them. As Simmonds described it later, he did an instant market survey and realized this product could end the use of <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> and <b>levers</b> to control aircraft flight surfaces. He negotiated an exclusive license to produce and sell these devices {{in all the world}} except France.|$|R
50|$|The {{short drive}} shaft {{operated}} a screw sleeve, which extended {{to work a}} <b>bell</b> <b>crank.</b> The <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> turned a transverse shaft fitted with an eccentric cam, which would push or pull the pivot clamp, thus moving the rocket forward or aftward along its centreline.|$|R
25|$|On Novelty, the {{cylinders}} were mounted vertically towards {{the rear of}} the engine (to the right {{of the men in the}} illustration). Directly below were <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> which changed the drive to horizontal. Connecting rods linked the <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> to the crank axle (the axle on the left in the illustration).|$|R
5000|$|Each {{side had}} 5 road wheels, {{using the same}} <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> {{suspension}} found on other Japanese tanks.|$|R
40|$|An Automatic jack can {{be easily}} {{operated}} by using of pneumatic cylinder which is operated by compressed air cylinder. The jack assembly will be mounted on both the sides of chassis according to the weight distributions of the car. Similarly it will be installed {{on the other side}} of the car. The system operates on pneumatic drive which consists of following main parts: Pneumatic cylinder, compressed air cylinder, <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> liver to lift the vehicle. The <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> liver actuate separately for either side of car as per the condition. The car gets lifted and load gets distributed on pivot of <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> liver they guide by c-sec case. The cylinder pushes the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> liver under guide of c-section. This jack will be very useful for all the senior citizens and especially for females (ladies) who find it extremely difficult to operate the jack manually in any breakdown condition. As the hydraulic oil is incompressible so the lifting capacity is more in comparison with the pneumatic system which operates on air which is compressible...|$|R
50|$|L&MR No.32 Experiment {{was built}} in 1833 with {{vertical}} cylinders mounted just behind the chimney, driving the wheels via a <b>bell</b> <b>crank.</b> The locomotive also had piston valves. These valves were probably {{the reason that the}} design was not a success, rather than the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> transmission, which was used successfully in other locomotives. Another reason that the locomotive was not successful was steam leakage from the cylinders. Experiment was withdrawn after a few months.|$|R
50|$|They {{are opened}} with a <b>crank,</b> <b>lever,</b> or cam handle, which is placed around hand height or {{at the bottom and}} serves as a window lock. A crank, stay, or {{friction}} hinge is necessary when the window opens outward, to hold the window in position despite wind.|$|R
5000|$|By 1840 Wornum had {{improved}} his grand actions {{by adding a}} sustaining spring tying the hammer butt and {{the short end of}} the <b>crank</b> <b>lever,</b> intended to improve repetition and [...] "assist in the forte," [...] but eventually abandoned the inverted construction due to its inconvenient form and turned his attention instead to manufacturing [...] "overstruck" [...] or downstriking horizontal pianos, where the hammers are located above the strings. In 1842 he patented the application of mobile hammer return springs to downstriking actions for grands and squares, and included claims for a new disposition of the <b>crank</b> <b>lever</b> and escapement, as well as a method of operating the damper in uprights with a leather strip attached either to the hammer butt or to a wire fixed in the key.|$|R

50|$|Experiment was a steam {{locomotive}} {{designed and built}} by Richard Roberts in 1833 for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR). The locomotive had vertical cylinders driving via <b>bell</b> <b>cranks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hibernia {{was built}} in 1834 for the D&KR. It {{was one of a}} class of three similar locomotives. Like Experiment, power {{transmission}} from the vertical cylinders was via <b>bell</b> <b>cranks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hibernia was a steam {{locomotive}} designed by Richard Roberts and built by Sharp, Roberts and Company in 1834 for the Dublin and Kingstown Railway (D&KR). The locomotive had vertical cylinders driving via <b>bell</b> <b>cranks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The Light Tank Mk III {{introduced}} a slightly modified version {{with only one}} <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> per bogie, causing the spring to lie somewhat angled as a result. This system was used on the Universal Carrier.|$|R
50|$|Speeds {{increased}} due to {{more powerful}} engines, {{and the quality}} of ride had to be improved. In the 1930s, the Christie suspension was developed, which allowed the use of coil springs inside a vehicle's armored hull, by changing the direction of force deforming the spring, using a <b>bell</b> <b>crank.</b> The T-34's suspension was directly descended from Christie designs. Horstmann suspension was a variation which used a combination of <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> and exterior coil springs, in use from the 1930s to the 1990s. The bogie, but nonetheless independent, suspension of the M3 Lee/Grant and the M4 Sherman was similar to the Hortsmann type, with the suspension contained within the track oval.|$|R
30|$|The <b>Bell</b> <b>Crank</b> {{system is}} the one {{with a pair of}} wheels on a <b>bell</b> <b>crank,</b> each bogie {{connected}} by a short arm and lever to a central spring running the tank length [9]. This system had too much interconnection but decent travel length and tended to make the tank sway back and forth a lot in motion. The single and double Torsion Bar system is a common modern-type tank suspension and can be found today on many fast track layers. The original structure and concept appeared on the German tiger tanks [10]. A steel bar runs under the bottom of the tank and twists with a short trailing arm connected to it and carrying a wheel. As the wheels hit bumps, the bar twists to absorb the impact. This system is compact, light, simple to manufacture and can provide decent travel length.|$|R
50|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} the Type 95 tank was its simple suspension system. Two bogie wheels were suspended on a single <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> with two <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> per side. The tracks were driven through the front sprockets. There were two return wheels. The suspension had troubles early on, with a tendency to pitch so badly on rough ground that the crew sometimes {{found it impossible to}} drive at any speed, and so it was modified with a brace to connect the pairs of bogies. Despite this, the tank continued to give its users a rough ride across any uneven ground. It was provided with an interior layer of asbestos padding separated from the hull with an air gap, to isolate the crew from the sun-heated armor plates, and to protect the crew from injury when the tank moved across rough terrain.|$|R
5000|$|According to Hipkins Wornum had {{perfected the}} crank, or [...] "tied" [...] double action during this year, and {{introduced}} {{it in his}} cabinet and three feet eight inch tall (112 cm), piccolo uprights by 1830. In this action a flexible tie fastened to the hammer butt and to a wire mounted on the <b>crank</b> <b>lever</b> has the same function as the dog spring from the 1826 double action. The <b>crank</b> <b>lever</b> also operated a check working against {{an extension of the}} hammer butt and raised the damper wire. This arrangement {{has come to be known}} as the tape check action, the name which is also applied to the modern upright action which differs in the form of the jack and the position and operation of the damper lever. Hipkins claimed that the [...] "facile touch gained by the new mechanism soon attracted the musical public" [...] but it was not put in widespread use in Britain even after the 1826 patent expired; he wrote in about 1880 that its durability had made it [...] "a favourite model of action for the manufacturers of the present day both here and abroad," [...] and predicted that it would eventually replace the sticker action in England, having already been generally adopted in France and Germany.|$|R
500|$|A tank {{suspension}} (for each side) {{consisted of}} two bogies, four rubber-covered return rollers, a track driving wheel and a track idler. Each bogie consisted of a cast box, four twin rubber-covered road wheels connected by balancing levers and two one-quarter elliptic leaf springs. The cast track driving wheel with removable sprocket ring was located in front, and the track idler with a <b>crank</b> <b>lever</b> tightener was located in the rear part of the vehicle. A track made from chrome-nickel steel was [...] wide and consisted of 108–109 links.|$|R
50|$|By 1932, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was {{producing}} an air-cooled diesel engine that was suitable for tanks. It was placed experimentally into a Type 89. This later {{became known as}} the Type 89-B medium tank. Subsequently, Major Tomio Hara designed the basis of many of the suspensions of future Japanese tanks, the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> scissors which had paired bogie wheels connected by a coil spring mounted horizontally outside the hull.|$|R
50|$|Primary {{flight control}} is {{achieved}} by use of dual control wheels and rudder pedals. The control wheels operate the elevator and ailerons mechanically through a system of cables, pulleys, push-pull tubes and <b>bell</b> <b>cranks.</b> Trim functions, microphone keying, autopilot override and steering system switches {{are located in the}} control wheels. The rudder pedals mechanically operate the rudder for directional yaw control. Nose wheel steering is electrically controlled via the rudder pedals.|$|R
50|$|The Type 87 Chi-I had {{a complex}} {{parallelogram}} suspension system with {{two pairs of}} road bogie wheels per leaf spring arrangement. Hara designed a <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> scissors suspension that paired the bogie wheels and connected them to a coil spring mounted horizontally outside the hull. This suspension became standard on {{the majority of the}} subsequently designed Japanese tanks and can be seen on the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank and Type 97 Chi-Ha, as examples.|$|R
50|$|In the June 2010 {{issue of}} Car and Driver magazine, safety {{specifications}} were revealed {{pertaining to the}} safety of the SLS AMG's gullwing doors. Ten to fifteen milliseconds after a detected rollover, explosive bolts situated {{at the top of the}} door frame fire and <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> separate the doors from the car for easy exit during a serious accident. An anti-lock braking system and a 3-stage Electronic stability program (ESP) are standard.|$|R
2500|$|The third {{requirement}} {{is for a}} linkage between the [...] "machines" [...] (engine and gun) to be synchronized.

50|$|The year 2000 car {{marked the}} return to inboard suspension. However, the {{mounting}} posts for the <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> caused cracks in the main frame tubes. This car utilized the same engine, differential, and rear chassis subframe configurations as the 1998 and 1999 cars. However, a new rear upright and half shaft designs were implemented to eliminate cv joint failure and to reduce overall weight. The remainder of the chassis was fully redesigned from the engine forward.|$|R

5000|$|The Type 2 Ke-To {{was based}} on the Type 98, using the same engine and <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> suspension. However, the gun turret was {{enlarged}} and the main armament was changed to the more powerful Type 1 37 mm gun, with a muzzle velocity of 800 m/s. The new 37 mm gun used gave the tank [...] "slightly better performance". The designation “Type 2” represented the year 1942, “Ke” represented “light”, and “To” represented the number seven.|$|R
50|$|In 1856 A. N. Wornum {{patented}} {{improvements to}} downstriking actions with a spring {{to keep the}} <b>crank</b> <b>lever</b> in constant contact with the key, {{as well as a}} new arrangement for the regulating button to allow easier adjustment and a method for improving repetition with a spring, and in 1862 patented further improvements with the aim of rendering the action very compact by moving the dampers below the hammers and operating them by projections attached at the far ends of the escapement levers. He also claimed a pivoting stand for square pianos {{in order for them to}} swing up and out of the way when not in use.|$|R
50|$|To {{combat the}} L-39's immense recoil, the recoil spring is so stiff {{that it would}} be {{impossible}} to cock the weapon with a traditional charging handle. Instead, a rotating <b>crank</b> <b>lever</b> on the right side of the gun is used to pull the bolt back. While semi-automatic in function, the L-39's bolt locks back after every shot, and the grip safety also functions to release the bolt. The entire front of the grip and trigger is protected by a large guard and a rubber buffer to protect the operator's hands from the spent casings which eject from the bottom of the gun at very high speeds.|$|R
50|$|The Type 95 So-Ki was {{an armored}} {{railroad}} {{car of the}} Imperial Japanese Army used for patrolling and guarding railway lines in both Manchuria and Burma.

Clocks displayed the phases of the moon and the annual progress of the sun through the zodiac; they had animated figures to strike the hours and entertain onlookers. From machines that imitate life and the heavens, it is an easy step to the idea that life itself might be a mechanical process and that the stars could be driven by some kind of celestial geartrain.
