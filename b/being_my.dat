[...] Prior to the Fragility tour in 2000, Reznor reflected that [...] "I’ve adopted {{a philosophy of}} the way to present Nine Inch Nails live that incorporates a theatrical element. I want it to be drama. I want my rock stars to be larger than life, you know? The Kurt Cobains of the world, I’m sick of that shit. I don’t want a gas station attendant <b>being</b> <b>my</b> hero. I grew up with Gene Simmons. I grew up with Ziggy Stardust." ...|$|E

Hayward proposed to the actress once they had each divorced but she declined, later explaining, [...] "I {{liked the idea of}} <b>being</b> <b>my</b> own single self." [...] They were involved for four years. In 1936, while she was touring Jane Eyre, Hepburn began a relationship with entrepreneur Howard Hughes. She had been introduced to him a year earlier by their mutual friend Cary Grant. Hughes wished to marry her, and the tabloids reported their impending nuptials, but Hepburn was too focused on resurrecting her failing career. They separated in 1938, when Hepburn left Hollywood after being labeled [...] "box office poison".|$|E

I believe that faith gives me a path to be {{cleansed}} of sin and have eternal life." [...] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying [...] "I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't – frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother {{was one of the}} most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead – <b>being</b> <b>my</b> brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{recording}} {{tracks for}} her greatest hits compilation, Greatest Hits – Chapter One, Clarkson began discussing with her record label RCA Records about plans for her sixth studio album being a Christmas release in late 2012, {{during which she}} also began to write original Christmas material. Greg Kurstin, whom she had previously collaborated with, was approached by Clarkson to produce the album; and together, they co-wrote the tracks [...] "Underneath the Tree" [...] and [...] "4 Carats". [...] "Underneath the Tree" [...] was produced by Kurstin, who also played most of the instruments, including a mellotron and a Chamberlin, to evoke a Phil Spector's Wall of Sound treatment—a sound that Billboard and HitFix noticed upon hearing the song. He also had Clarkson provide all the voices in it, including all its backing vocals. She recalled the experience as new, stating, [...] "I've never had to do anything like this before—doing all my backup vocals, essentially <b>being</b> <b>my</b> own choir." ...|$|E

[...] He retreats into his office when he realizes that he never came close to that dream. Toby talks to Michael, who decides to start online dating (with the user name [...] "Little Kid Lover"). After being tormented by Jake all day, Dwight is finally stern with him, which quietly pleases Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey). Pam wins over Jake with the paper shredder. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) leaves the office early to go on a date, to Pam's chagrin. Michael and Dwight end the party by singing to the children.|$|E
500|$|In {{providing}} instrumentation for the record, Kurstin {{used all}} of his instruments, such as a Mellotron and a Chamberlin, taping them from a distance to simulate the Wall of Sound, a recording technique originally developed by Phil Spector that was popular in the early 1960s. He enlisted Clarkson to provide all the background vocals herself. Clarkson, who grew up singing in a choir, {{was pleased with the}} aspect, saying: [...] "Blending is something I knew how to do from childhood. Sometimes I'd have to do an alto instead of a soprano because they needed a bigger sound. But I've never had to do anything like this before—doing all my backup vocals, essentially <b>being</b> <b>my</b> own choir." [...] Together, they began to record in May 2013 and continued through the summer of that year, beginning by recording [...] "White Christmas" [...] with Clarkson in the vocal booth and with Kurstin on a piano. She commented: [...] "The production is all him. I would be just like 'Hey, can we make this more jazz? Hey, can we make this more bluesy. And he just, like Harry Potter, made this happen.

500|$|Since airing, [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] has {{received}} generally mixed to negative reception from critics. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{commented that the}} episode [...] "feels like an amalgamation of elements from prior holiday programs and never really elicits much humor. Christmas is commercialized and corporations use and abuse their customers? Those aren’t exactly rich insights, so [...] {{comes across as a}} below average episode." [...] In his review of the DVD Christmas With the Simpsons, Digitally Obsessed critic Joel Cunningham wrote that the episode [...] "comes from Season 11, well past the point when the series had sacrificed character for absurdist humor. Unless you don't think evil toy marketers, sentient Furbys, and Gary Coleman qualify. Anyway, after the school nearly goes bankrupt, Principal Skinner signs a contract with corporate backers who use the kids to conduct market research. There are some good gags, but the story doesn't hang together very well." [...] Adam Tyner of DVD Talk argued that the episode [...] "has a couple of good gags (Gary Coleman chatting on the phone <b>being</b> <b>my</b> favorite) but is quickly forgettable". Brian James of PopMatters described Coleman's cameo as [...] "hysterical" [...] in 2004, and Meghan Lewit of the same website listed [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] at number eight on her 2009 list of the [...] "10 best holiday themed TV episodes." ...|$|E

He was also the leader of the Squadrone Volante, the free thinking [...] "Flying Squad" [...] movement within the Catholic Church. Christina and Azzolino were so close that the pope asked him to shorten his visits to her palace; but they remained lifelong friends. In a letter on 26 January 1676 to Azzolino Christina writes (in French) that she would never offend God or give Azzolino reason to take offense, but this [...] "does not prevent me from loving you until death, and since piety relieves you from <b>being</b> <b>my</b> lover, then I relieve you from <b>being</b> <b>my</b> servant, for I shall live and die as your slave."
