5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of <b>breath.</b> <b>In</b> a minority of cases the amount of air in the chest increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, it can result in death. Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis.|$|E
5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the chest is compressing the airways at this time. This can result in more air from the previous breath remaining within the lungs when the next breath is started, resulting {{in an increase in}} the total volume of air in the lungs at any given time, a process called hyperinflation or air trapping. Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of <b>breath</b> <b>in</b> COPD, as it is less comfortable to breathe in when the lungs are already partly full. Hyperinflation may also worsen during an exacerbation.|$|E
5|$|Post {{is where}} {{mainstream}} music could have gone. While modern chart music hasn't gone there entirely, Björk {{opened up the}} space for a more enigmatic and less readily labelled style; she undoubtedly helped broaden the playing field. Modern music still, regularly, finds itself, like a dinosaur stuck in a tar pit, going nowhere and heading for extinction. Yet, there are pockets of air that artists like Björk - and those before her like Kate Bush - have pumped full of oxygen for the next generations of rare, raw and intense female talents - the Lordes and Sias of the world - to <b>breath.</b> <b>In</b> this way, the album title is a misnomer. Björk was a precursor rather than a late comer, less post than pre. Post stands today as {{a body of work}} that still informs the more marginal artistic fringes of modern music and reminds us how narrow and staid our world would be without outliers like Björk.|$|E

5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a <b>breath</b> <b>in</b> their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E

25|$|Breath analyzers do not {{directly}} measure {{blood alcohol content}} or concentration, which requires the analysis of a blood sample. Instead, they estimate BAC indirectly by measuring the amount of alcohol in one's <b>breath.</b> <b>In</b> general, two types of breathalyzer are used. Small hand-held breathalyzers are not reliable enough to provide evidence in court but reliable enough to justify an arrest. Larger breathalyzer devices found in police stations can then be used to produce court evidence.|$|E

25|$|Chilton {{was taken}} to the {{hospital}} in New Orleans on Wednesday, March 17, 2010, complaining of health problems, and died the same day of a heart attack. Chilton had experienced at least two episodes of shortness of <b>breath</b> <b>in</b> the week prior to his fatal heart attack, though he did not seek medical attention in part because he did not have health insurance. He was survived by his wife, Laura, a son, Timothee, and a sister, Cecilia.|$|E
25|$|Expression on {{instruments}} can {{be closely}} related {{to the role of the}} <b>breath</b> <b>in</b> singing, and the voice's natural ability to express feelings, sentiment and deep emotions. Whether these can somehow be categorized is perhaps the realm of academics, who view expression as an element of musical performance that embodies a consistently recognizable emotion, ideally causing a sympathetic emotional response in its listeners. The emotional content of musical expression is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds (e.g., a startlingly-loud 'bang') and of learned associations (e.g., a national anthem), but can rarely be completely separated from its context.|$|E
25|$|Larger tonsilloliths {{may cause}} {{multiple}} symptoms, including recurrent halitosis, which frequently accompanies a tonsil infection, sore throat, white debris, a bad taste {{in the back}} of the throat, difficulty swallowing, ear ache, and tonsil swelling. A medical study conducted in 2007 found an association between tonsilloliths and bad <b>breath</b> <b>in</b> patients with a certain type of recurrent tonsillitis. Among those with bad breath, 75% of the subjects had tonsilloliths, while only 6% of subjects with normal halitometry values (normal breath) had tonsilloliths. A foreign body sensation may also exist {{in the back of}} the throat. The condition may also be an asymptomatic condition, with detection upon palpating a hard intratonsillar or submucosal mass.|$|E

25|$|Infrared-based breath analyzers project an {{infrared}} beam of radiation through the captured <b>breath</b> <b>in</b> the sample chamber and detect the absorbance {{of the compound}} {{as a function of}} the wavelength of the beam, producing an absorbance spectrum that can be used to identify the compound, as the absorbance is due to the harmonic vibration and stretching of specific bonds in the molecule at specific wavelengths (see infrared spectroscopy). The characteristic bond of alcohols in infrared is the O-H bond, which gives a strong absorbance at a short wavelength. The more light is absorbed by compounds containing the alcohol group, the less reaches the detector on the other side—and the higher the reading. Other groups, most notably aromatic rings and carboxylic acids can give similar absorbance readings.|$|E
25|$|The species {{within the}} {{hymenopteran}} order commonly sting or bite others {{with which they}} interact. After a man was stung by a European hornet, he experienced tingling {{at the site of}} contact, as well as headaches and shortness of <b>breath.</b> <b>In</b> the hospital, he was found to have a fast, irregular heartbeat with a blood pressure of 111/63. His subsequent ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. V. crabro toxin contains neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenalineneurotoxin apamin, as well as enzymes phospholipase A and hyaluronidase, the compound histamine, and proteins melittin and bradykinin. These compounds have been shown to cause tachycardia episodes in smaller animals. The mechanism of this attack is still undetermined, but this man possibly was just more susceptible to vespine stings than other humans. Currently, the two most effective treatments are electrical cardioversion or propafenone. The man in this case study was given an oral dose of propafenone (150mg) and his atrial fibrillation resolved.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{red blood}} cell {{transfusion}} was considered when the hemoglobin level fell below 100g/L or hematocrit falls below 30%. Because each unit of blood given carries risks, a trigger level lower than that at 70 to 80g/L is now usually used {{as it has been}} shown to have better patient outcomes. The administration of a single unit of blood is the standard for hospitalized people who are not bleeding, with this treatment then followed with re-assessment and consideration of symptoms and hemoglobin concentration. Patients with poor oxygen saturation may need more blood. The advisory caution to use blood transfusion only with more severe anemia is in part due to evidence that outcomes are worsened if larger amounts are given. One may consider transfusion for people with symptoms of cardiovascular disease such as chest pain or shortness of <b>breath.</b> <b>In</b> cases where patients have low levels of hemoglobin but are cardiovascularly stable, parenteral iron is a preferred option based on both efficacy and safety. Other blood products are given where appropriate, such as clotting deficiencies.|$|E

25|$|The game's ending {{depends on}} how the player interacted with the Little Sisters, and the fates of non-player {{characters}} Holloway, Poole and Alexander within the game. Eleanor can save Sofia Lamb or allow her to die, {{depending on whether the}} player spared or executed the non-player characters. If Delta rescued all of the Little Sisters he will breathe his last <b>breath</b> <b>in</b> Eleanor's arms, the weather will be sunny and clean, then she will absorb his personality and memories and leave Rapture with the Little Sisters to change the world for the better, dropping the doll that one of the little sisters give her in the ocean, which slightly resembles Delta, in order to mourn his death, and to make his death count. If Delta harvested all of the Little Sisters then Eleanor will extract Delta's ADAM and become bent on world domination, the weather becoming dark and stormy as the corpses of Rapture's inhabitants float to the surface. A mix between rescuing and harvesting the little sisters gives the player a choice; either Eleanor can absorb his ADAM and become evil, or Delta can stop her and die, in which case Eleanor will mourn his death and make her own way in life.|$|E

500|$|Shortness {{of breath}} {{is often the}} symptom that most bothers people. It is {{commonly}} described as: [...] "my breathing requires effort," [...] "I feel out of breath," [...] or [...] "I can't get enough air in". Different terms, however, {{may be used in}} different cultures. Typically the shortness of breath is worse on exertion of a prolonged duration and worsens over time. In the advanced stages, it occurs during rest and may be always present. It is a source of both anxiety and a poor quality of life in those with COPD. Many people with more advanced COPD breathe through pursed lips and this action can improve shortness of <b>breath</b> <b>in</b> some.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To compare how and to {{what extent}} {{ingestion}} of hydrogen water and milk increase <b>breath</b> hydrogen <b>in</b> adults. Methods: Five subjects without specific diseases, ingested distilled or hydrogen water and milk as a reference material that could increase breath hydrogen. Their end-alveolar breath hydrogen was measured. Results: Ingestion of hydrogen water rapidly increased breath hydrogen to the maximal level of approximately 40 ppm 10 – 15 min after ingestion and thereafter rapidly decreased to the baseline level, whereas ingestion of the same amount of distilled water did not change breath hydrogen (p � 0. 001). Ingestion of hydrogen water increased both hydrogen peaks and the area under the curve (AUC) of <b>breath</b> hydrogen <b>in</b> a dose-dependent manner. Ingestion of milk showed a delayed and sustained increase of <b>breath</b> hydrogen <b>in</b> subjects with milk intolerance for up to 540 min. Ingestion of hydrogen water produced breath hydrogen at AUC levels of 2 to 9 ppm hour, whereas milk increased breath hydrogen to AUC levels of 164 ppm hour for 540 min after drinking. Conclusion: Hydrogen water caused a rapid increase <b>in</b> <b>breath</b> hydrogen <b>in</b> a dose-dependent manner; however, the rise <b>in</b> <b>breath</b> hydrogen was not sustained compared with milk...|$|R

500|$|Treatment of an MI is time critical. Aspirin is an {{appropriate}} immediate treatment for a suspected MI. Nitroglycerin or opioids {{may be used to}} help with chest pain; however, they do not improve overall outcomes. Supplemental oxygen should be used in those with low oxygen levels or shortness of <b>breath.</b> <b>In</b> a STEMI, treatments attempt to restore blood flow to the heart, and include percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), where the arteries are pushed open and may be stented, or thrombolysis, where the blockage is removed using medications. People who have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are often managed with the blood thinner heparin, with the additional use of PCI in those at high risk. In people with blockages of multiple coronary arteries and diabetes, coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) may be recommended rather than angioplasty. [...] After an MI, lifestyle modifications, along with long term treatment with aspirin, beta blockers, and statins, are typically recommended.|$|E
