The scent glands are smaller than the gray wolf's, <b>but</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> same color. Its fur color variation is much less varied than that of a wolf. The coyote also carries its tail downwards when running or walking, rather than horizontally as the wolf does.|$|E
5|$|The plays {{were written}} across thirty-six years of Sophocles' career {{and were not}} {{composed}} in chronological order, but instead were written in the order Antigone, Oedipus Rex, and Oedipus at Colonus. Nor were they composed as a trilogy – a group of plays to be performed together, <b>but</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> remaining parts of three different groups of plays. As a result, there are some inconsistencies: notably, Creon is the undisputed king {{at the end of}} Oedipus Rex and, in consultation with Apollo, single-handedly makes the decision to expel Oedipus from Thebes. Creon is also instructed to look after Oedipus' daughters Antigone and Ismene at the end of Oedipus Rex. By contrast, in the other plays there is some struggle with Oedipus' sons Eteocles and Polynices in regard to the succession. In Oedipus at Colonus, Sophocles attempts to work these inconsistencies into a coherent whole: Ismene explains that, in light of their tainted family lineage, her brothers were at first willing to cede the throne to Creon. Nevertheless, they eventually decided to take charge of the monarchy, with each brother disputing the other's right to succeed. In addition to being in a clearly more powerful position in Oedipus at Colonus, Eteocles and Polynices are also culpable: they consent (l. 429, Theodoridis, tr.) to their father's going to exile, which is one of his bitterest charges against them.|$|E
5|$|The scheme {{presented}} in the table {{is known as the}} impedance analogy. Circuit diagrams produced using this analogy match the electrical impedance of the mechanical system seen by the electrical circuit, making it intuitive from an electrical engineering standpoint. There is also the mobility analogy, in which force corresponds to current and velocity corresponds to voltage. This has equally valid results but requires using the reciprocals of the electrical counterparts listed above. Hence, M → C, S → 1/L, D → G where G is electrical conductance, the inverse of resistance. Equivalent circuits produced by this scheme are similar, <b>but</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> dual impedance forms whereby series elements become parallel, capacitors become inductors, and so on. Circuit diagrams using the mobility analogy more closely match the mechanical arrangement of the circuit, making it more intuitive from a mechanical engineering standpoint. In addition to their application to electromechanical systems, these analogies are widely used to aid analysis in acoustics.|$|E

25|$|All {{white blood}} cells (WBCs) are known as leukocytes. Leukocytes differ from other cells {{of the body in}} that they are not tightly {{associated}} with a particular organ or tissue; thus, their function {{is similar to that of}} independent, single-cell organisms. Leukocytes are able to move freely and interact with and capture cellular debris, foreign particles, and invading microorganisms. Unlike many other cells in the body, most innate immune leukocytes cannot divide or reproduce on their own, <b>but</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> products of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells present in the bone marrow.|$|E

25|$|Partial DNA matches are not {{searches}} themselves, <b>but</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> {{result of}} moderate stringency CODIS searches that produce a potential match that shares {{at least one}} allele at every locus. Partial matching does not involve the use of familial search software, such as those used in the UK and United States, or additional Y-STR analysis, and therefore often misses sibling relationships. Partial matching {{has been used to}} identify suspects in several cases in the UK and United States, and has also been used as a tool to exonerate the falsely accused. Darryl Hunt was wrongly convicted in connection with the rape and murder of a young woman in 1984 in North Carolina. Hunt was exonerated in 2004 when a DNA database search produced a remarkably close match between a convicted felon and the forensic profile from the case. The partial match led investigators to the felon’s brother, Willard E. Brown, who confessed to the crime when confronted by police. A judge then signed an order to dismiss the case against Hunt.|$|E
500|$|The {{size of the}} {{pneumothorax}} (i.e. {{the volume}} of air in the pleural space) can be determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy by measuring {{the distance between the}} chest wall and the lung. This is relevant to treatment, as smaller pneumothoraces may be managed differently. An air rim of 2cm means that the pneumothorax occupies about 50% of the hemithorax. British professional guidelines have traditionally stated that the measurement should be performed {{at the level of the}} hilum (where blood vessels and airways enter the lung) with 2cm as the cutoff, while American guidelines state that the measurement should be done at the apex (top) of the lung with 3cm differentiating between a [...] "small" [...] and a [...] "large" [...] pneumothorax. The latter method may overestimate the size of a pneumothorax if it is located mainly at the apex, which is a common occurrence. The various methods correlate poorly, <b>but</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> best easily available ways of estimating pneumothorax size. CT scanning (see below) can provide a more accurate determination of the size of the pneumothorax, but its routine use in this setting is not recommended.|$|E

500|$|Ursula Franklin {{rejects the}} idea that {{powerful}} technologies automatically determine {{the ways in which}} people live and work. She maintains that the uses of technology are not preordained, <b>but</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> result of conscious choices. The dominant prescriptive technologies establish structures of power and control that follow what Franklin sees as male patterns of hierarchy, authoritarianism, competition and exclusion. Female workers are often victims of these patterns. Mechanical sewing machines were introduced in 1851 with the promise that they would liberate women from household drudgery. But when the machines ended up in factory sweatshops to produce cheap clothing, the new technology was used to exploit female workers. [...] "A strictly prescriptive technology with the classic division of labour arose from the introduction of new, supposedly liberating 'domestic' machines," [...] Franklin notes. [...] "In the subsequent evolution of the garment industry, much of the designing, cutting, and assembling began to be automated, often to the complete exclusion of workers." [...] She points to similar examples in other industries. Female operators helped introduce the telephone only to be replaced by automated switchboards after the technology had been successfully established while secretaries struggled to make the early mechanical typewriters function properly, but ended up performing fragmented and increasingly meaningless tasks.|$|E
500|$|There {{are four}} main bloodlines {{groups within the}} Morgan breed today, known as the Brunk, Government, Lippitt, and Western Working [...] "families." [...] There are also smaller subfamilies. The Brunk Family, {{particularly}} noted for soundness and athleticism, traces to the Illinois breeding program of Joseph Brunk. The Lippitt Family or [...] "Lippitts" [...] trace to the breeding program of Robert Lippitt Knight, grandson of industrialist Robert Knight and maternal great-great grandson of Revolutionary War officer Christopher Lippitt, founder of the Lippitt Mill. Robert Lippitt Knight focused on preservation breeding of horses descended from Ethan Allen II and this line is considered the [...] "purest" [...] of the four lines, with the most lines tracing back to Figure and no outcrosses to other breeds in the 20th or 21st centuries. [...] The Government Family is the largest, tracing to Morgans bred by the US Morgan Horse Farm between 1905 and 1951. The foundation sire of this line was General Gates. When USDA involvement ended, the University of Vermont purchased not only the farm, but much of its breeding stock and carries on the program today. [...] The Working Western Family, abbreviated 2WF, have no common breeder or ancestor, <b>but</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> horses bred to be stock horses and work cattle, some descended from Government farm stallions shipped west.|$|E
