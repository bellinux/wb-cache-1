Silicon wafers were oxidized to 20 nm at 1150 °C by rapid thermal oxidation, according to two different thermal recipes in order to yield different Si-SiO 2 interface roughnesses. After oxide removal, typical atomic force microscopy (AFM) line scans of the silicon surface were exported into the MEDICI program as a description of the Si-SiO 2 interface in order to calculate the electric field distribution within the oxide layer of a bidimensional MOS <b>capacitor</b> <b>biased</b> into accumulation. This distribution was found to be highly inhomogeneous even for relatively smooth Si-SiO 2 interfaces, displaying strong local electric field enhancements, the spatial distribution of which will be called electronic roughness in this work. Simple local oxide thinning at the position of the protrusions cannot account for these field enhancements, thus indicating that the shape of the protrusion is dictating the electronic roughness. The electronic roughness could be correlated with electric breakdown characteristics of actual MOS capacitors prepared on these wafers...|$|R

40|$|For a {{dielectric}} solid {{surrounded by}} an electrolyte and positioned inside an externally <b>biased</b> parallel-plate <b>capacitor,</b> we study numerically how the resulting induced-charge electro-osmotic (ICEO) flow depends on the topology {{and shape of the}} dielectric solid. In particular, we extend existing conventional electrokinetic models with an artificial design field to describe the transition from the liquid electrolyte to the solid dielectric. Using this design field, we have succeeded in applying the method of topology optimization to find system geometries with non-trivial topologies that maximize the net induced electro-osmotic flow rate through the electrolytic capacitor in the direction parallel to the capacitor plates. Once found, the performance of the topology optimized geometries has been validated by transferring them to conventional electrokinetic models not relying on the artificial design field. Our results show the importance of the topology and shape of the dielectric solid in ICEO systems and point to new designs of ICEO micropumps with significantly improved performance.

40|$|Josephson {{junction}} qubits {{are promising}} candidates for a scalable quantum processor. Such qubits are commonly manipulated {{by means of}} sequences of rf-pulses and different methods are used to determine their quantum state. The readout {{should be able to}} distinguish the two qubit states with high accuracy and be faster than the relaxation time of the qubit. We discuss and experiment with a readout method based on the switching of a Josephson junction from the zero voltage state to a finite voltage state. The Josephson junction circuit has a non-linear dynamics and when it is brought to a bifurcation point, it can be made arbitrarily sensitive to small perturbations. This extreme sensitivity at a bifurcation point can be used to distinguish the two quantum states if the topology of the phase space of the circuit leads to a quick separation into the final states where re-crossings of the bifurcation point are negligible. We optimize a switching current detector by analyzing the phase space of a Josephson junction circuit with frequency dependent damping. A pulse and hold technique is used where an initial current pulse brings the junction close to its bifurcation point and the subsequent hold level is used to give the circuit enough time to evolve until the two states can be distinguished by the measuring instrument. We generate the pulse and hold waveform by a new technique where a voltage step with following linear voltage rise is applied to a <b>bias</b> <b>capacitor.</b> The frequency dependent damping is realized by an on-chip RC-environment fabricated with optical lithography. Josephson junction circuits are added on by means of e-beam lithography. Measurements show that switching currents can be detected with pulses as short as 5 ns and a resolution of 2. 5 % for a sample directly connected to the measurement leads of the cryostat. Detailed analysis of the switching currents in the RC-environment show that pulses with a duration of 20 us can be explained by a generalization of Kramers' escape theory, whereas switching the same sample with 25 ns pulses occurs out of thermal equilibrium, with sensitivity and speed adequate for qubit readout.

40|$|In {{the event}} of beam loss at the LHC, ATLAS Inner Detector {{components}} nearest the beam line may be subjected to unusually large amounts of radiation. Understanding their behavior in such an event is important in determining whether they would still function properly. We built a SPICE model of the silicon strip module electrical system to determine the behavior of its elements during a realistic beam loss scenario. We found that the power supply and bias filter characteristics strongly affect the module response in such scenarios. In particular, the following self-limiting phenomena were observed: there is a finite amount of charge initially available on the <b>bias</b> filter <b>capacitors</b> for collection by the strips; the power supply current limit reduces {{the rate at which}} the bias filter capacitors' charge can be replenished; the reduced bias voltage leads to a smaller depletion depth in the sensors which results in less collected charge.

In particular, the voltage across the coupling capacitor stays below the specifications limit for a wide range of beam loss rates. The current into the ABCD channels exceeds the limit only for very high rates of beam loss...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} by {{theory and}} experiment, the Josephson junction switching current detector {{in an environment}} with frequency dependent damping. Analysis of the circuit's phase space show that a favorable topology for switching can be obtained with overdamped dynamics at high frequencies. A pulse-and-hold method is described, where a fast switch pulse brings the circuit close to an unstable point in the phase space when biased at the hold level. Experiments are performed on Cooper pair transistors and Quantronium circuits, which are overdamped at high frequencies with an on-chip RC shunt.

The <b>bias</b> charges the <b>capacitor</b> formed by the wire and the grounded silicon back contact. Electrostatic forces increase the contact pressure and allow us to tune the friction between the wire and the silicon nitride surface. Using nanowires of about 40 - 70 nm diameter and a few microns in length we have applied biases in the range + 12 to - 12 V. A monotonic increase of the sliding friction with voltage was observed. This increase in friction with the normal force implies that the mesoscopic nanowire-surface system behaves like a macroscopic contact, despite the nanometer size of the contact in the direction of motion.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 High-accuracy and {{high-speed}} CMOS track-and-hold (T/H) or sample-and-hold (S/H) circuits are {{an important}} part of the analog-to-digital interface. The switched-capacitor (SC) circuits usually contain one or more op-amps whose dc offset, finite gain, finite bandwidth have a big impact on the accuracy of the track-and-hold circuit. Basic correlated double sampling (CDS) scheme can reduce such effects, but the compensation that it provides may not be good enough for high-accuracy application. Also, the high-quality analog poly-poly capacitors used in most SC circuits are not available in a basic digital CMOS process. The MOSFET-only predictive track-and-hold circuit, discussed in this thesis, replaces the poly-poly capacitors with easily-available low-cost area-saving MOSFET <b>capacitors</b> <b>biased</b> in accumulation region. It also uses the predictive correlated double sampling (CDS) scheme, in which the op-amp predicts its output for the next clock period during the present clock period, so that the adjacent two output samples are nearly the same. The predictive operation results in more correlation between the unwanted signal and the signal that is subtracted during the double sampling, and hence can achieve offset and gain compensation over wider frequency range. Hence, this circuit is suitable for high-accuracy applications, while using only a basic digital process...|$|R
40|$|Flexible {{termination}} capacitors {{were designed}} to reduce stresses transmitted to the ceramic dielectric of a capacitor and thereby prevent flex cracking. Two studies were conducted to examine the reliability of flexible termination multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) subjected to environmental stresses. The first study used temperature-humidity-bias to compare the effects of termination type (standard vs. flexible), presence of a conformal coating (acrylic coating vs. no coating), and voltage bias level. In situ monitoring demonstrated similar failure statistics between the flexible and standard termination capacitors, presence of conformal coating, and voltage bias level. Upon removal from THB conditions recovery occurred only in the standard termination MLCCs. Flexible termination capacitors at the rated voltage bias {{were found to have}} more permanent failures after exposure to THB testing as compared to standard termination capacitors. Failure analysis indicated that silver and palladium migration between electrodes was the failure mechanism in the <b>biased</b> flexible termination <b>capacitors.</b> In the second study flexible and standard termination MLCCs experienced a storage test in which they were exposed to elevated temperature and humidity conditions. It was found that the standard termination MLCCs had a lower reliability with the majority of the MLCCs failing compared to the flexible termination MLCCs where only one MLCC failed. Nearly all failures were for insulation resistance with few capacitors failing for other parameters. Subsequent bake-out of the MLCCs showed some recovery, however more failures were still occurring in the standard termination MLCCs compared to the flexible termination MLCCs.
