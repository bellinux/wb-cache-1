500|$|... "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] {{is a song}} by Irish {{rock band}} U2. It is the opening track from their 1983 album War and was {{released}} as the album's third single on 11 March 1983 in Germany and the Netherlands. [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] is noted for its militaristic drumbeat, harsh guitar, and melodic harmonies. One of U2's most overtly political songs, its lyrics describe the horror felt by an observer of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, mainly focusing on the Bloody Sunday incident in Derry where British troops shot and killed unarmed civil rights protesters and bystanders. At the same time, the lyrics reject hate and revenge as a response, {{as noted in the}} line [...] "There's many lost, <b>but</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> who has won." [...] Along with [...] "New Year's Day," [...] the song helped U2 reach a wider listening audience. It was generally well received by critics on the album's release.|$|E
