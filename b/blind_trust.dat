5000|$|Voting trusts {{are also}} {{sometimes}} used to resolve conflicts of interest.

40|$|In this thesis, I explore whether <b>blind</b> <b>trusts</b> {{present a}} viable option for {{campaign}} finance reform. More specifically, would either permitting (voluntary) or requiring (mandatory) anonymous donations for political campaigns allow for fully funded, yet privately funded, campaigns while preventing problems, whether real or perceived, such as buying influence (quid pro quo) or buying access, which are traditionally associated with large campaign donations? To study this question, I have examined the constitutional origins {{of the need to}} fund federal campaigns, Congress’ power to regulate campaigns under the Constitution’s Elections Clause, the constitutional protection of speech, and the concern of large donations corrupting the political system. Further, I have also reviewed and summarized the history of campaign finance law and salient court decisions regarding the history of campaign finance regulation. Finally, I have reviewed the current use of <b>blind</b> <b>trusts</b> by government officials as well as existing relevant literature suggesting <b>blind</b> <b>trusts</b> may be {{a viable option}} for campaign reform. Having reviewed the salient constitutional history, law, and discourse, voluntary <b>blind</b> <b>trusts</b> could offer a great deal of protection to candidates from the appearance of impropriety, while possibly working complementary to existing campaign finance restrictions. There are conflicting principles at play between making campaign finance trusts completely anonymous to avoid even the appearance of impropriety and republican principles of disclosure, the First Amendment, and the ability to police non-disclosure of donations. This analysis is important because there is a legitimate public interest in preventing not only the quid pro quo of trading campaign donations for votes or access to politicians, but protecting against even the appearance of impropriety. Voluntary <b>blind</b> <b>trusts</b> may prove part of the solution of campaign finance reform while offering candidates additional protection from even the appearance of impropriety.

5000|$|In the United Kingdom, {{while the}} Labour Party was in {{opposition}} in 1992-97, its front bench received funding from <b>blind</b> <b>trusts.</b> One {{set up to}} fund its campaign in the 1997 general election received donations from wealthy supporters, some of whose names leaked out, and some of whom received life peerages into the House of Lords after Labour won the election. The Neill Committee's report in 1998 found the use of <b>blind</b> <b>trusts</b> to be [...] "inconsistent {{with the principles of}} openness and accountability" [...] and recommended that such trusts be [...] "prohibited as a mechanism for funding political parties, party leaders or their offices, Members of Parliament or parliamentary candidates" [...] This was incorporated into the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 as section 57 [...] "Return of donations where donor unidentifiable".|$|R

The suit alleged that Corker did not fully disclose {{his interest in the}} property where the Wal-Mart was built or in the adjacent nature area at the time the deal was made. The Corker campaign countered that an article published on March 5, 2003 in the Chattanooga Times Free Press publicly identified Corker's ownership interest in the land, through Osborne Enterprises, and that as mayor, a <b>blind</b> <b>trust</b> barred Corker from being involved in issues like these that affected his business.|$|E

500|$|True to his word, Buckner {{never again}} met Bradley {{in a joint}} debate. Rumors began to {{circulate}} that Buckner was afraid to meet Bradley in debate again, and Bradley did little to dispel these rumors. The Democrats were not completely united throughout the campaign, with prominent members of the party, including Milton J.

The Democratic Henderson Gleaner was also critical, opining [...] "We {{should be ashamed of}} ourselves." [...] Throughout the state, Bradley hammered the issue of the <b>blind</b> <b>trust</b> afforded the perennial Democratic officeholders, specifically calling for an examination of the treasury. Though Bradley lost the election by more than 16,000 votes, he made the best showing of any Republican gubernatorial candidate to that time and garnered strong support from the state's black voters.

40|$|About {{the only}} {{campaign}} finance {{issue on which}} there is a strong consensus is the belief that the law should force candidates to disclose the identity of contributors. A growing group of scholars and advocates believe that mandated disclosure should be the only campaign finance regulation; they argue that other restrictions are counterproductive because they tend to shift money to less accountable forms of political speech such as "independent expenditures" and "issue advocacy. "Representative John T. Doolittle (R-Calif.) has proposed the "Citizen Legislature and Political Freedom Act" that essentially would repeal all limits on political campaign contributions and merely require immediate disclosure by candidates when they do receive contributions. This type of "pure disclosure" reform has garnered support from a wide spectrum of political activists, from Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to Stanford Law School dean Kathleen Sullivan. But there exists in our polity a counter-image [...] the voting booth [...] that stands against the cult of disclosure. Ballot secrecy was adopted {{toward the end of the}} nineteenth century to deter political corruption. Voting booth privacy disrupted the economics of vote buying, making it much more difficult for candidates to buy votes because, at the end of the day, they could never know for sure who voted for them. A similar pro-anonymity argument can be applied to campaign finance. We could harness similar anonymity benefits by creating a "donation booth": a screen that forces donors to funnel campaign contributions through <b>blind</b> <b>trusts</b> that would keep candidates from learning the identity of their supporters. Just as the secret ballot makes it more difficult for candidates to buy votes, mandating anonymous donations through a system of <b>blind</b> <b>trusts</b> might make it harder for candidates to sell access or influence because they would never know which donors had paid the price. Knowledge about whether the other side actually fulfills his or her promise is an important prerequisite for trade. People [...] including political candidates [...] are less likely to deal if they are uncertain whether the other side performs. ...|$|R
40|$|Interpersonal {{trust is}} a one-sided social dilemma. Building on the binary trust game, we ask how trust and {{trustworthiness}} can evolve {{in a population}} where partners are matched randomly and agents sometimes act as trustors and sometimes as trustees. Trustors {{have the option to}} costly check a trustee's last action and to condition their behavior on the signal they receive. We show that the resulting population game admits two components of Nash equilibria. Nevertheless, the long-run outcome of an evolutionary social learning process modeled by the best response dynamics is unique. Even if unconditional distrust initially abounds, the trustors' checking option leads trustees to build a reputation for trustworthiness by honoring trust. This invites free-riders among the trustors who save the costs of checking and trust blindly, until it does no longer pay for trustees to behave in a trustworthy manner. This results in cyclical convergence to a mixed equilibrium with behavioral heterogeneity where suspicious checking and <b>blind</b> <b>trusting</b> coexist while unconditional distrust vanishes.
