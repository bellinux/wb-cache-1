5|$|As Queen Mary 2 is {{too large}} to dock in many ports, {{passengers}} are ferried {{to and from the}} ship in tenders, which can be used as lifeboats in an emergency. These are stored while at sea in davits alongside the lifeboats. To transport passengers to shore the tenders pull up to one of four loading stations, each of which has a large hull door that hydraulically opens outwards to form a <b>boarding</b> <b>platform,</b> complete with railings and decking.|$|E
5|$|Watsessing Avenue (also {{known as}} Watsessing) is a New Jersey Transit rail station in Bloomfield, New Jersey, along the Montclair-Boonton Line. It is located beneath the Bloomfield Police Benevolent Association meeting hall (which {{formerly}} {{served as the}} station building) near the corner of Watsessing Avenue and Orange Street in Bloomfield. It {{is one of two}} stations on the line where the <b>boarding</b> <b>platform</b> is below ground level (the Glen Ridge Station, two stops away from it, is the other). The Watsessing station and the Kingsland station in Lyndhurst on the Main Line shared similar designs (both station platforms are located below street level) and were built about the same time.|$|E
25|$|Within the neighborhood, AC Transit's 26 line carries {{passengers}} {{to and from}} the neighborhood along 14th Street, routing directly to nearby BART stations. AC Transit's Uptown Regional Transit Center bus mall on nearby Thomas L. Berkeley Way (20th Street) is now in full farebox service, and features multiple bus shelters with seating, NextBus arrival prediction signs, local and Rapid Bus service to Oakland's streetcar suburbs. These stations host local service, Rapid service, Transbay Express, and All Nighter service. A Translink Add Value Machine is located at AC Transit Headquarters on Franklin Street. The number 1 line running along the neighborhood on 12th Street, between San Leandro and Berkeley, is years into the planning process for the implementation of a full scale bus rapid transit line. The most substantial planning alternative proposed for this system would feature double-articulated buses with five to six doors at <b>boarding</b> <b>platform</b> level, a separated bus-only lane, center median platforms with proof-of-payment ticket machines to speed boarding, and signalization priority to allow bus drivers to change traffic lights in their favor.|$|E

500|$|The [...] station {{includes}} a Quik-Trak ticket vending machine, restrooms, a seating area and covered walkways {{to both the}} drive-up area and the [...] <b>boarding</b> <b>platform.</b> As the station is unstaffed, all tickets from the station need to be pre-paid, purchased from Quik-Trak or on the train from a conductor. Passengers in need of checked baggage service are advised to utilize the downtown station instead because of this. The station parking lot contains 300 spaces and costs $2 for each two hour period, up to $7 per day, per vehicle. All revenue generated from parking fees is used to finance the station's operating costs. Transport {{to and from the}} airport terminal is provided by the free shuttle buses operated by the airport.|$|E
2500|$|By late antiquity, in the 1st centuries AD, ramming tactics had {{completely}} disappeared {{along with the}} knowledge of the design of the ancient trireme. Medieval galleys instead developed a projection, or [...] "spur", in the bow that was designed to break oars and to act as a <b>boarding</b> <b>platform</b> for storming enemy ships. The only remaining examples of ramming tactics were passing references to attempts to collide with ships in order to destabilize or capsize them.|$|E
2500|$|When {{using the}} anchor line to control ascents and descents, a [...] "tag line" [...] (or [...] "lead line" [...] {{may be used}} between the anchor line and {{the stern of the}} vessel, to allow secure {{transfer}} between these points in a current. A floating [...] "drift line" [...] (also [...] "tag line", [...] "current line" [...] or [...] "trail line"} may be streamed from the stern or <b>boarding</b> <b>platform</b> to assist divers who drift astern of the vessel, and for something to hold onto while waiting to use the ladder. They can either hold onto the line and be pulled in by the crew, or pull themselves along the line. The far end of the line is usually marked with a brightly coloured buoy to show divers where it is and to help other boats avoid crossing the line. If there is any significant risk of a diver drifting away from the site, the dive boat should either be ready to slip the moorings at short notice, or have a tender in the water. Some skippers will tether the tender behind the dive boat where it can also be used as a drift line. A lazy shot or decompression trapeze may be suspended from the boat near the boarding area, and the drift line may be set up between this and the anchor line to guide decompressing divers ascending on the anchor line to the more convenient facility at the stern for the shallow stops.|$|E
