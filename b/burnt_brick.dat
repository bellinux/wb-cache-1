Cubes of concrete were prepared and tested to study the compressive strength. The result indicate that the concrete having brick bats as aggregates may be termed as medium light weight concrete having a density between 2000 - 2200 kg/m 3. To produce the same workability, the brick aggregates concrete requires greater proportion of water than the normal gravel aggregate concrete. Use of broken over <b>burnt</b> <b>bricks</b> as coarse aggregate for structural concrete is recom-mended when natural aggregate is not easily available, high strength of concrete is not required and the bearing capacity of the soil is low...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{focused on}} the use of cassava starch as an {{additive}} in <b>burnt</b> earth <b>bricks.</b> <b>Burnt</b> earth <b>bricks</b> {{is one of the oldest}} building materials in use and abundantly found everywhere with affordable and reasonable cost. With regard to the availability of cassava in most part of the country, looking into the possibility of using cassava starch as an additive for <b>burnt</b> earth <b>bricks</b> production is of great importance in other to enhance their physical property, such as water absorption, abrasion resistance and compressive strength. Cassava starch content of 0 %, 4 %, 6 %, 10 % and 12 % were used in the mix. Batching mix by volume was adopted to get the quantity of material to be use. The specimens were produced in 100 mm cube mould, demoulded after 24 hours and air dry for 28 days of curing before burning in an electric furnace at a temperature of 1000 oC for a period of two hours. The result gotten from the research show that water absorption of <b>burnt</b> earth <b>bricks</b> was drastically reduced with the incorporation of cassava starch in the mix. Abrasion resistance and compressive strength of the earth <b>burnt</b> <b>bricks</b> were increased from 4. 09 cm 2 /g to 27 cm 2 /g and from 1. 19 N/mm 2 to 2. 19 N/mm 2 respectively at cassava starch content of 6 %. Satisfactory performance of the earth <b>burnt</b> <b>bricks</b> was achieved at an optimum amount of 6 % of cassava starch content and is thus recommended for incorporation as an additive in producing earth <b>burnt</b> <b>bricks...</b>|$|R

The most considerable lines radiate towards the Mosque. There are few public buildings. The principal Wakalahs are four in number; one is the Wakalat Bab Salam near the Harim, another the Wakalat Jabarti, and two are inside the Misri gate; they all belong to Arab citizens. These Caravanserais are used principally as stores, rarely for dwelling-places like those of Cairo; travellers, therefore, must hire houses at a considerable expense, or pitch tents to the detriment of health and to their extreme discomfort. The other public buildings are a few mean coffee-houses and an excellent bath in the Harat Zarawan, inside the town: far superior to the unclean establishments of Cairo, it borrows something from the luxury of Stambul. The houses are, for the East, well built, flat-roofed and double-storied; the materials generally used are a basaltic scoria, <b>burnt</b> <b>brick,</b> and palm wood.
